https://openalex.org/W1982682419,"SMYD2 is a lysine methyltransferase that catalyzes the monomethylation of several protein substrates including p53. SMYD2 is overexpressed in a significant percentage of esophageal squamous primary carcinomas, and that overexpression correlates with poor patient survival. However, the mechanism(s) by which SMYD2 promotes oncogenesis is not understood. A small molecule probe for SMYD2 would allow for the pharmacological dissection of this biology. In this report, we disclose LLY-507, a cell-active, potent small molecule inhibitor of SMYD2. LLY-507 is >100-fold selective for SMYD2 over a broad range of methyltransferase and non-methyltransferase targets. A 1.63-Å resolution crystal structure of SMYD2 in complex with LLY-507 shows the inhibitor binding in the substrate peptide binding pocket. LLY-507 is active in cells as measured by reduction of SMYD2-induced monomethylation of p53 Lys(370) at submicromolar concentrations. We used LLY-507 to further test other potential roles of SMYD2. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics showed that cellular global histone methylation levels were not significantly affected by SMYD2 inhibition with LLY-507, and subcellular fractionation studies indicate that SMYD2 is primarily cytoplasmic, suggesting that SMYD2 targets a very small subset of histones at specific chromatin loci and/or non-histone substrates. Breast and liver cancers were identified through in silico data mining as tumor types that display amplification and/or overexpression of SMYD2. LLY-507 inhibited the proliferation of several esophageal, liver, and breast cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that LLY-507 serves as a valuable chemical probe to aid in the dissection of SMYD2 function in cancer and other biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2092192356,"The importance of brown adipose tissue as a site of nonshivering thermogenesis has been well documented. Emerging studies suggest that skeletal muscle is also an important site of thermogenesis especially when brown adipose tissue function is lacking. We recently showed that sarcolipin (SLN), an uncoupler of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump, could contribute to heat production in skeletal muscle. In this study, we sought to understand how loss of UCP1 or SLN is compensated during cold exposure and whether they are both necessary for thermogenesis. Toward this goal, we generated a UCP1;SLN double knock-out (DKO) mouse model and challenged the single and DKO mice to acute and long-term cold exposures. Results from this study show that there is up-regulation of SLN expression in UCP1-KO mice, and loss of SLN is compensated by increased expression of UCP1 and browning of white adipose tissue. We found that the DKO mice were viable when reared at thermoneutrality. When challenged to acute cold, the DKO were extremely cold-sensitive and became hypothermic. Paradoxically, the DKO mice were able to survive gradual cold challenge, but these mice lost significant weight and depleted their fat stores, despite having higher caloric intake. These studies suggest that UCP1 and SLN are required to maintain optimal thermogenesis and that loss of both systems compromises survival of mice under cold stress.Background: The mechanisms underlying UCP1-independent thermogenesis are not well understood.Results: Loss of both SLN and UCP1 results in compromised thermogenic ability and severe sensitivity to acute cold.Conclusion: Sarcolipin-mediated thermogenesis is required for optimal thermogenesis and is up-regulated in the absence of UCP1.Significance: Sarcolipin is a crucial contributor to thermogenesis and energy expenditure.

https://openalex.org/W2117192811,"Solid tumor growth triggers a wound healing response. Similar to wound healing, fibroblasts in the tumor stroma differentiate into myofibroblasts (also referred to as cancer-associated fibroblasts) primarily, but not exclusively, in response to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Myofibroblasts in turn enhance tumor progression by remodeling the stroma. Among proteases implicated in stroma remodeling, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-9, play a prominent role. Recent evidence indicates that MMP-9 recruitment to the tumor cell surface enhances tumor growth and invasion. In the present work, we addressed the potential relevance of MMP-9 recruitment to and activity at the surface of fibroblasts. We show that recruitment of MMP-9 to the fibroblast cell surface occurs through its fibronectin-like (FN) domain and that the molecule responsible for the recruitment is lysyl hydroxylase 3 (LH3). Functional assays suggest that both pro- and active MMP-9 trigger α-smooth muscle actin expression in cultured fibroblasts, reflecting myofibroblast differentiation, possibly as a result of TGF-β activation. Moreover, the recombinant FN domain inhibited both MMP-9-induced TGF-β activation and α-smooth muscle actin expression by displacing MMP-9 from the fibroblast cell surface. Together our results uncover LH3 as a new docking receptor of MMP-9 on the fibroblast cell surface and demonstrate that the MMP-9 FN domain is essential for the interaction. They also show that the recombinant FN domain inhibits MMP-9-induced TGF-β activation and fibroblast differentiation, providing a potentially attractive therapeutic reagent toward attenuating tumor progression where MMP-9 activity is strongly implicated.Background: MMP-9 cell surface activity promotes tissue remodeling.Results: Fibroblast cell surface recruitment of MMP-9 via its fibronectin-like domain (FN) by lysyl hydroxylase 3 (LH3) induces TGF-β activation and myofibroblast differentiation.Conclusion: We identify a novel mechanism of MMP-9 recruitment to stromal cells that can be modulated by recombinant FN.Significance: Recombinant FN may allow selective MMP-9 blockade in tumor-associated tissue remodeling.

Significance: Recombinant FN may allow selective MMP-9 blockade in tumor-associated tissue remodeling. Tumor cell interactions with host tissue stroma play a key role in determining tumor progression that culminates in metastatic growth. It is well established that malignant tumor growth initiates a wound healing response that maintains a state of tissue remodeling, which favors tumor survival, invasion, and dissemination. Orchestration of tumor-associated tissue remodeling is mediated in part by tumor cells and in part by a variety of recruited host tissue cells, including various leukocyte subsets and mesenchymal cell subtypes ranging from mesenchymal stem cells to myofibroblasts (1.Pietras K. Ostman A. Hallmarks of cancer: interactions with the tumor stroma.Exp. Cell Res. 2010; 316: 1324-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 2.Mueller M.M. Fusenig N.E.

Most of these cells participate in generating soluble mediators that include a plethora of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and enzymes. Among the proteolytic enzymes implicated in tumor-host cross-talk are matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), 2The abbreviations used are: MMPmatrix metalloproteinaseLH3lysyl hydroxylase-3FNfibronectin-likeα-SMAα-smooth muscle actinECMextracellular matrixHEXhemopexin-likeTMLCtransformed mink lung epithelial cellsHSFhuman skin fibroblastsNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidPLAproximity ligation assayPLOD3procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 3. a large family of zinc-dependent extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading endopeptidases that play a key role in tissue remodeling during development and repair (4.Stamenkovic I. Matrix metalloproteinases in tumor invasion and metastasis.Sem. Cancer Biol. 2000; 10: 415-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The majority of MMPs are secreted, but at least a fraction of their proteolytic activity is observed at the cell surface where they can be anchored by a variety of cell surface receptors to provide controlled degradation of the ECM and activation of a variety of latent growth factors (5.Stamenkovic I. Extracellular matrix remodelling: the role of matrix metalloproteinases.J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 448-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Whether or not cell surface anchoring of secreted MMPs occurs exclusively in autocrine fashion in the context of tissue remodeling or whether it may also occur in paracrine fashion whereby MMP-anchoring cells are distinct from MMP-secreting cells remains to be clarified. matrix metalloproteinase lysyl hydroxylase-3 fibronectin-like α-smooth muscle actin extracellular matrix hemopexin-like transformed mink lung epithelial cells human skin fibroblasts nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid proximity ligation assay procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 3. MMP-9, also known as gelatinase B, has been shown to play a prominent role in the progression of numerous tumor types by promoting tumor cell invasion and angiogenesis (6.Coussens L.M. Tinkle C.L.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). Similar to other MMPs, MMP-9 is synthesized as an inactive zymogen, or pro-MMP-9, composed of a propeptide, a catalytic domain containing fibronectin-like (FN) repeats, a linker region or hinge domain, and a C-terminal hemopexin-like (HEX) domain thought to be necessary for substrate recognition (4.Stamenkovic I. Matrix metalloproteinases in tumor invasion and metastasis.Sem. Cancer Biol. 2000; 10: 415-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The FN domain, which is found only in MMP-9 and MMP-2, is composed of three tandem fibronectin type II-like motifs that form a collagen-binding domain critical for the positioning of substrates for subsequent cleavage (8.Xu X. Chen Z. Wang Y. Yamada Y. Steffensen B. Functional basis for the overlap in ligand interactions and substrate specificities of matrix metalloproteinases-9 and -2.Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The collagen-binding domain of MMP-9 has been shown to bind gelatin (9.Collier I.E. Krasnov P.A. Strongin A.Y. Birkedal-Hansen H.

Each fibronectin type II-like module displays binding specialization, which generates exosites specific for other ligands degraded by the protease (10.Steffensen B. Wallon U.M. Overall C.M.

Cooperation among collagen binding sites within these three modules increases substrate specificity and thereby has the potential to localize the enzyme to collagen either in the extracellular matrix or on the cell surface (11.Overall C.M. Molecular determinants of metalloproteinase substrate specificity: matrix metalloproteinase substrate binding domains, modules, and exosites.Mol. Biotechnol. 2002; 22: 51-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MMP-9 expression is low or absent in normal quiescent tissues but is strongly induced under conditions that trigger tissue remodeling, including development, wound healing, and tumor invasion. MMP-9 is produced by tumor-associated host tissue cells, including endothelial cells, various leukocytes, and tumor cells themselves, and is thought to promote tumor growth and metastasis (4.Stamenkovic I.

Matrix metalloproteinases and tumor metastasis.Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2006; 25: 9-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Several secreted MMPs, including pro-MMP-9, can at least transiently be anchored to the cell surface, which directs their proteolytic activity toward pericellular substrates and may provide protection from natural inhibitors. However, the mechanisms that underlie their association with the cell membrane appear to be diverse and remain to be fully explored (5.Stamenkovic I. Extracellular matrix remodelling: the role of matrix metalloproteinases.J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 448-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 15.Fridman R. Toth M. Chvyrkova I. Meroueh S.O.

Commun. 2003; 308: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus far, MMP-9 has been shown to use among others the cell surface hyaluronan receptor CD44 as a docking molecule in certain tumor cell types and keratinocytes (17.Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Localization of matrix metalloproteinase 9 to the cell surface provides a mechanism for CD44-mediated tumor invasion.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). This association stabilizes MMP-9 proteolytic activity at the cell surface to facilitate controlled collagen IV degradation and to promote invasion (17.Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Localization of matrix metalloproteinase 9 to the cell surface provides a mechanism for CD44-mediated tumor invasion.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). In addition, CD44-associated MMP-9 as well as MMP-2 can cleave and activate latent TGF-β1 and -2 (18.Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Cell surface-localized matrix metalloproteinase-9 proteolytically activates TGF-β and promotes tumor invasion and angiogenesis.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 163-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, coordination of CD44, MMP-9, and TGF-β function may provide a physiological mechanism of tissue remodeling that can be adopted by malignant cells to promote their own growth and dissemination (18.Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Cell surface-localized matrix metalloproteinase-9 proteolytically activates TGF-β and promotes tumor invasion and angiogenesis.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 163-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Mira E. Lacalle R.A. Buesa J.M. de Buitrago G.G. Jiménez-Baranda S. Gómez-Moutón C. Martínez-A C. Mañes S. Secreted MMP9 promotes angiogenesis more efficiently than constitutive active MMP9 bound to the tumor cell surface.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1847-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). As key regulators of ECM turnover, fibroblasts may include MMP-9 in their arsenal of tissue remodeling reagents. However, mechanisms that govern putative MMP-9 association with the surface of normal stromal cells, including fibroblasts, remain to be elucidated. Fibroblasts produce low amounts of MMP-9, suggesting that they may recruit tumor cell or leukocyte-derived MMP-9 to their own cell surface to promote ECM remodeling by harnessing its proteolytic activity. In the present work, we show that MMP-9 produced by tumor cells is recruited to the fibroblast surface and that recruitment requires the FNII repeats or collagen-binding domain of MMP-9. We demonstrate that the structure that mediates MMP-9 docking to the fibroblast surface is provided by lysyl hydroxylase 3 (LH3), which displays lysyl hydroxylase as well as galactosyl- and glucosyltransferase activity (20.Heikkinen J. Risteli M. Wang C. Latvala J. Rossi M. Valtavaara M. Myllylä R. Lysyl hydroxylase 3 is a multifunctional protein possessing collagen glucosyltransferase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36158-36163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). LH3 is expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum but is also associated with the plasma membrane via collagenous proteins (21.Salo A.M. Wang C. Sipilä L. Sormunen R. Vapola M. Kervinen P. Ruotsalainen H. Heikkinen J. Myllylä R. Lysyl hydroxylase 3 (LH3) modifies proteins in the extracellular space, a novel mechanism for matrix remodeling.J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 207: 644-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We show that LH3-mediated MMP-9 recruitment contributes to TGF-β activation, which stimulates fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts. Tumor cells and leukocytes may thus provide a source of MMP-9 that fibroblasts can recruit and use to activate TGF-β and stimulate their own differentiation. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T, fibrosarcoma (HT1080), transformed mink lung epithelial cells (TMLC), glioblastoma (U251), osteosarcoma (U2OS), breast adenocarcinoma (MDA-MB231), human skin fibroblasts (HSF), human lung embryonic fibroblasts (MRC-5), and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultures in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Chemical compounds used included:4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (164610, Calbiochem), Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitors (11836170001, Roche Applied Science), FcR blocking reagent (130-059-901, Miltenyi Biotec), FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (E2692, Promega), Interferin (409-01, Polyplus Transfection), Sulfo-SBED Biotin Label Transfer Reagent (33034, Pierce), SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (34080, Thermo Scientific Pierce), human TGF-β1 (100-B-001, R&D Systems), Duolink II PLA Probe Anti-Mouse PLUS (DUO92001, Sigma-Aldrich), Duolink II PLA Probe Anti-Rabbit MINUS (DUO92005, Sigma-Aldrich), Duolink In Situ Detection Reagents Red (DUO92008, Sigma-Aldrich), and procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 3 (PLOD3) (human; three unique 27-mer siRNA duplexes) (SR305927, Origene). Antibodies used were as follows: anti-HA-agarose matrix (11 815 016 001, Roche Applied Science), anti-LH3 (11027-1-AP, ProteinTech), anti-MMP-9 (MS-817-P0, Thermo Scientific), anti-α-SMA (A2547, Sigma), anti-tubulin (CP06, Calbiochem), anti-transferrin receptor (13-6800, Invitrogen), anti-TGF-β1,2,3 (MAB1835, R&D Systems), anti-v5 (R960-25, Invitrogen), donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (A21202, Invitrogen), Ni-NTA-agarose beads (30210, Qiagen), streptavidin-agarose beads (DAM1467561, Millipore), anti-v5-agarose beads (A7345, Sigma), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated sheep anti-mouse (NA931V, GE Healthcare), and goat anti-rabbit (P0448, Dako). Wild type (WT) pro-MMP-9 and the different MMP-9 constructs, including the catalytically dead protein containing the E402Q mutation, the FN domain composed of the fibronectin type II-like motifs (FN223–389), the hemopexin homology domain (HEX520–707), the ΔFN or MMP-9Δ223–389 mutant lacking the FN domain, the ΔHEX or MMP-9Δ520–707 mutant lacking the hemopexin homology domain, and CD5, were inserted into the pLIVC vector, derived from the pLVTHM lentiviral vector by the removal of the shRNA cassette and GFP gene and insertion of a phosphoglycerate kinase-puromycin cassette. All constructs were 3′ tagged with sequences encoding 6 histidines and the v5 peptide. 60% confluent HEK293T cells in a 100-mm dish were transfected with 1.25 μg of pMD2G (envelope plasmid), 3.75 μg of pCMVs (packaging plasmid), and 5 μg of pLIVC (transfer vector) containing MMP-9 or the different mutants using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent at a ratio of 1:3 and incubated at 37 °C. Lentiviruses were collected after 48 h, filtered through 0.45-μm filters, and concentrated by ultracentrifugation. Target cells (CHO, U2OS, HT1080, and MRC-5) at 40% confluence in 6 wells were washed with PBS and infected in two rounds of 8-h intervals with lentiviruses using Polybrene (1:1000) overnight at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with PBS and transferred to a 100-mm dish with fresh medium. On the following day, cells were selected with puromycin (1 μg/μl for CHO and U2OS and 2 μg/μl for MRC-5). Stable transfectants of each His-tagged construct were established in U2OS and CHO cells. Purification was performed using the histidine tag and high affinity nickel beads as follows. The supernatant of CHO cells provided by Evitria (Zürich, Switzerland) was incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose beads (2 ml of beads for 1 liter of sample), which were then washed with PBS and in washing solution (5 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 200 mm NaCl). Purified proteins were eluted in 20 mm and 200 mm imidazole, and fractions were concentrated with Amicon centrifugal filters (Millipore) depending on the molecular weight (50,000 nominal molecular weight limit for pro-MMP-9 and ΔFN and 3000 nominal molecular weight limit for FN). Protein concentration was determined by densitometry using ImageJ. Activation of pro-MMP-9 was performed directly on nickel beads using 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. 35 mg of 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate was dissolved in 10 ml of 0.1 m NaOH and diluted in TTC reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% Triton X-100) to obtain a 2.5 mm solution. Pro-MMP-9 bound to Ni-NTA-agarose beads was incubated with this solution at 37 °C for 3 h and eluted as described before. Tumor cell lines and fibroblasts were incubated overnight at 37 °C with filtered conditioned medium from U2OS cells stably expressing recombinant MMP-9 or its different mutants or with 0.5 μg/ml purified peptides. The following day, cells were lysed using lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) containing Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitors. Immunoblotting of conditioned medium and cell lysates was performed using anti-v5 antibody, and the ImageJ program was used for recruitment quantification. Cells grown in 2 × 150-mm dishes until 60–70% confluent were washed and scraped in cold PBS and centrifuged for 5 min at 300 × g at 4 °C. Membranes were sensitized by resuspending cell pellets in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, and phosphatase and protease inhibitor mixtures, pH 7.4). Postnuclear supernatant was obtained by mechanical disruption of cells with a 22-gauge needle and centrifugation for 10 min at 600 × g at 4 °C. Postnuclear supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation for 45 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C to separate cytosol (supernatant) from membrane (pellet) fractions. Membranes were washed twice with homogenization buffer and solubilized using lysis buffer containing Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitors. Western blotting was performed according to standard procedures. The following antibody concentrations were used: anti-v5, 1:5000; anti-transferrin receptor, 1:1000; anti-LH3, 1:500; anti-α-SMA, 1:5000; anti-tubulin, 1:4000; anti-MMP-9, 1:200; HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse, 1:20,000; and goat anti-rabbit, 1:20,000. ECL was revealed using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate. MRC-5 fibroblasts were grown on glass coverslips until they reached confluence. Cells were treated with pro-MMP-9, FN, E402Q, ΔFN, and CD5 and incubated with anti-v5 antibody (1:1500) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and further incubated with secondary anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (1:1500) for 1 h at 4 °C. Antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer (PBS and 10% FBS). Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, and mounted using Immuno-Mount. DAPI (Roche Applied Science) was used to visualize the nuclei. Images were acquired with a Leica SP5 AOBS confocal microscope. Confluent MRC-5 cells in square plates (Nunc) were treated with 50 μg of Sulfo-SBED Biotin Label Transfer Reagent-labeled MMP-9, FN, and ΔFN at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were washed in the dark and cross-linked applying UV light at 365 nm for 8 min before lysis. Finally, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using v5-agarose beads and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis at the Protein Analysis Facility (Lausanne, Switzerland). The luciferase assay system (E1501, Promega) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, TMLC transfected with the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter responsive to TGF-β and linked to a luciferase reporter system were plated at 3 × 105 cells/ml in 24 wells for 6 h. MRC-5-conditioned medium collected after 3 days was incubated with TMLC at 37 °C for 20 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and lysed with 1× lysis buffer for 20 min on ice. 20 μl of cell lysates was mixed with 90 μl of luciferase substrate. Luminescence was read at 570 nm using a Synergy MX luminometer for 2 s with autosensitivity. Confluent MRC-5 cells in a 25-cm dish were treated with 13 μg of Sulfo-SBED-labeled v5-tagged MMP-9, FN, and ΔFN overnight at 37 °C. The interaction was cross-linked with UV light at 365 nm for 8 min after which MRC-5 cells were lysed with lysis buffer. 4 mg of cell lysates was precleared with HA-agarose matrix for 1 h at 4 °C and then immunoprecipitated with anti-v5-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed seven times with lysis buffer and a final wash with PBS, and proteins were eluted by boiling the beads for 5 min in sample buffer. Purified complexes were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-LH3 antibody. MRC-5 cells in 6-well plates at 30% confluence were transfected with 1 nm siRNA pool against LH3. After 48–72 h, 0.5 μg/ml purified v5-tagged MMP-9, FN, or ΔFN was incubated with control and LH3-depleted MRC-5 cells overnight at 37 °C. MRC-5 cells at 80% confluence in 6-well plates containing 8-mm coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies mouse anti-MMP-9 (1:300), rabbit anti-LH3 (1:50), and mouse anti-v5 (1:1500) for 1 h at room temperature and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PIPES buffer, pH 6.8 for 12 min at room temperature. PLA amplification was labeled with Alexa Fluor 594. Coverslips were counterstained with DAPI, mounted, and imaged using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal fluorescence microscope with a 40× oil immersion objective. The resulting images were analyzed using a script written in ImageJ macro language. MRC-5 cells were incubated with v5-tagged MMP-9 and ΔFN overnight at 37 °C. Cells were then scraped in PBS, blocked with FcR blocking reagent (1:10 diluted in PBS) for 30 min at 4 °C, and incubated with anti-v5 or an irrelevant mouse isotype-matched antibody (1:400) for 3 h followed by anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibody (1:400) for 30 min at room temperature. DAPI was used to discriminate between living and dead cells. Cells were sorted using a Beckman Coulter Gallios flow cytometry system and analyzed using FlowJo_V10. Graphs and statistical analysis were carried out using GraphPad Prism® 6.0 software. Results represent mean values ±S.E. in all graphs. p values were as follows: ns, p > 0.05; *, p ≤ 0.05; **, p ≤ 0.01; ***, p ≤ 0.001; ****, p ≤ 0.0001. To compare association of MMP-9 with the surface of tumor versus stromal cells, we incubated HEK293T, HT1080 (fibrosarcoma), TMLC, U251 (glioblastoma), U2OS (osteosarcoma), MDA-MB231 (breast carcinoma), and immortalized HSF as well as MRC-5 (human fetal lung fibroblasts) in conditioned medium of U2OS cells engineered to secrete v5-tagged pro-MMP-9. Following overnight incubation, cell membranes were isolated by cell fractionation, and protein recruitment was assessed by anti-v5 antibody blot analysis. We observed pro-MMP-9 to be more markedly recruited to fibroblast membranes (HSF and MRC-5) than to those of the different tumor cell lines (Fig. 1A). Cell fractionation analysis confirmed that pro-MMP-9 is recruited to fibroblast membranes. Pro-MMP-9 recruitment to the cell surface has been proposed to be mediated by its HEX domain (13.Malla N. Sjøli S. Winberg J.O. Hadler-Olsen E. Uhlin-Hansen L. Biological and pathobiological functions of gelatinase dimers and complexes.Connect. Tissue Res. 2008; 49: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that different MMP domains may be responsible for MMP-9 docking to the surface of different cell types. Accordingly, we asked whether the HEX or other domains of MMP-9 mediates its recruitment to the fibroblast cell surface. We therefore engineered a series of deletion mutants corresponding to defined MMP-9 domains tagged with sequences encoding 6 histidines and the v5 peptide. The mutants included a catalytically dead protein containing the E402Q mutation within the catalytic domain, ΔFN lacking the FNII repeat collagen-binding domain, ΔHEX lacking the hemopexin homology domain; FN composed of fibronectin type II-like repeats (FN223–389) only, and HEX composed of the hemopexin homology domain (HEX520–707) only (Fig. 1B). All mutants were inserted into the pLIVC retroviral vector and stably produced in CHO cells. Each mutant was compared with v5-tagged pro-MMP-9 for recruitment to fibroblasts by incubating MRC-5 cells in the corresponding CHO cell-conditioned medium overnight at 37 °C and subsequently performing Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis of MRC-5 membrane fractions and intact cells, respectively. Anti-v5 antibody Western blot analysis of membrane fractions showed that all proteins encoded by constructs containing the FN domain (pro-MMP-9, FN, ΔHEX, and E402Q) were recruited to MRC-5 fibroblasts, whereas those lacking the FN domain were not (Fig. 1C). Immunofluorescence analysis using anti-v5 antibody confirmed the observation that both pro-MMP-9 and the inactive E402Q mutant are recruited to the MRC-5 cell surface. The FN domain alone was also, whereas constructs lacking the FN motifs, including ΔFN and CD5, used as a negative unrelated protein control were not (Fig. 1D). The observation that ΔHEX is less strongly detected than functional or cataly"
https://openalex.org/W2088681575,"The human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae is a strictly fermentative organism that relies on glycolytic metabolism to obtain energy. In the human nasopharynx S. pneumoniae encounters glycoconjugates composed of a variety of monosaccharides, which can potentially be used as nutrients once depolymerized by glycosidases. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesise that the pneumococcus would rely on these glycan-derived sugars to grow. Here, we identified the sugar-specific catabolic pathways used by S. pneumoniae during growth on mucin. Transcriptome analysis of cells grown on mucin showed specific upregulation of genes likely to be involved in deglycosylation, transport and catabolism of galactose, mannose and N acetylglucosamine. In contrast to growth on mannose and N-acetylglucosamine, S. pneumoniae grown on galactose re-route their metabolic pathway from homolactic fermentation to a truly mixed acid fermentation regime. By measuring intracellular metabolites, enzymatic activities and mutant analysis, we provide an accurate map of the biochemical pathways for galactose, mannose and N-acetylglucosamine catabolism in S. pneumoniae. Intranasal mouse infection models of pneumococcal colonisation and disease showed that only mutants in galactose catabolic genes were attenuated. Our data pinpoint galactose as a key nutrient for growth in the respiratory tract and highlights the importance of central carbon metabolism for pneumococcal pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1977875320,"Inflammation and oxidative stress through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are consistently associated with metabolic syndrome/type 2 diabetes. Although the role of Nox2, a major ROS-generating enzyme, is well described in host defense and inflammation, little is known about its potential role in insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Insulin resistance induced by a high fat diet was mitigated in Nox2-null mice compared with wild-type mice after 3 or 9 months on the diet. High fat feeding increased Nox2 expression, superoxide production, and impaired insulin signaling in skeletal muscle tissue of wild-type mice but not in Nox2-null mice. Exposure of C2C12 cultured myotubes to either high glucose concentration, palmitate, or H2O2 decreases insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation and glucose uptake. Pretreatment with catalase abrogated these effects, indicating a key role for H2O2 in mediating insulin resistance. Down-regulation of Nox2 in C2C12 cells by shRNA prevented insulin resistance induced by high glucose or palmitate but not H2O2. These data indicate that increased production of ROS in insulin resistance induced by high glucose in skeletal muscle cells is a consequence of Nox2 activation. This is the first report to show that Nox2 is a key mediator of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle."

Eumelanins produced by pathogenic Cryptococcus neoformans fungi are virulence factors that render the fungal cells resistant to host defenses and certain antifungal drugs. Because of their insoluble and amorphous characteristics, neither the pigment bonding framework nor the cellular interactions underlying melanization of C. neoformans have yielded to comprehensive molecular-scale investigation.

We demonstrated that the aliphatic moieties of solid C. neoformans melanin ghosts include cell-wall components derived from polysaccharides and/or chitin that are associated proximally with lipid membrane constituents. Prior to development of the mature aromatic fungal pigment, these aliphatic moieties form a chemically resistant framework that could serve as the scaffold for melanin synthesis.

A suite of 1- and 2D 13C solid-state NMR experiments was used to address several important open structural questions as follows. 1) What are the developmental time frames that characterize the formation of indole-based aromatics, oxygenated carbons from cell-wall polysaccharides, and fatty acyl-based cell membrane constituents within the melanizing fungal cells? 2) What kinds of polysaccharide and acylglyceride molecular frameworks, or co-organized scaffolds, are formed by C. neoformans glucose metabolism in the presence of l-dopa? 3) Which indole-derived moieties from the obligatory l-dopa precursor are spatially close and/or covalently linked to the glucose-derived constituents of the cell wall in melanized C. neoformans cells? 4) Which side chain-derived functional moieties from the obligatory l-dopa precursor are spatially close and/or covalently connected to the glucose-derived constituents of the cell wall in melanized C. neoformans cells? Hence, in addition to probing the (supra)molecular architectures of the cell-wall polysaccharides and indole-based polymers individually at atomic scale, we have examined their intercomponent spatial proximities and covalent linkages within the melanin assembly of C. neoformans.

Fungal cell pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 2000 rpm and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to isolate melanin ghosts for biophysical study. Cell walls were removed by suspending the cells in 1.0 m sorbitol, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5, and incubating for 24 h at 30 °C with 10 mg/ml lysing enzymes from Trichoderma harzianum. Centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 min yielded a pellet of melanized protoplasts that was washed several times with PBS to obtain a nearly clear supernatant. To denature proteinaceous materials, the melanized cell suspension was incubated with 4 m guanidine thiocyanate for 12 h at room temperature in a rocker (Shaker 35, Labnet, Woodbridge, NJ). The recovered cell debris was collected, washed 2–3 times with ∼20 ml of PBS, and then incubated for 4 h at 65 °C in 5 ml of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm CaCl2, 5% SDS) containing 1 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche Applied Science). The cell debris was recovered, washed 2–3 times with ∼20 ml of PBS, and then subjected to three successive Folch lipid extractions (29.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. A simple method for the isolation and purification of total lipids from animal tissues.J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) while maintaining the proportions of chloroform, methanol, and saline solution in the final mixture as 8:4:3. To hydrolyze cellular contaminants associated with melanin, the final product was suspended in 20 ml of 6 m HCl and boiled for 1 h. The black particles that survived HCl treatment retain the cellular shape of melanized C. neoformans cells and are known as melanin ghosts; they correspond to melanin pigments and pigment-bound cellular components. These particles were dialyzed against distilled water for 14 days with daily water changes and then lyophilized. The reproducibility of the protocol was tested by repeating the extraction process with two different batches of C. neoformans pigments produced with each of the catecholamine precursors. Solid-state NMR measurements were carried out using either of two instruments as follows: a Varian (Agilent) DirectDrive 1 NMR spectrometer operating at a 1H frequency of 600 MHz and equipped with a 1.6-mm HXY fastMAS probe filled with 2–6 mg of powdered sample and spinning typically at 15 kHz (±20 Hz) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA); or a Bruker Avance I spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin Corp., Billerica, MA) operating at a 1H frequency of 750 MHz and equipped with 4-mm HX, 3.2-mm HCN, or 3.2 mm HCN E-free probes containing 6–18 mg of powdered sample and spinning typically at 15 kHz (±5 Hz). All spectra were acquired at spectrometer-set temperatures of 25 °C. Typical 90° pulse lengths for 1H were ∼2.5 μs for the Bruker HCN probe and ∼3 μs for the HCN E-free probe; 13C 90° pulse lengths were ∼5 μs for both the 4-mm HX and 3.2-mm HCN probes. For the 1.6-mm Varian HXY fastMAS probe, typical 90° pulse lengths were ∼1.2 μs for 1H and ∼1.3 μs for 13C. The 1D 13C spectral datasets were processed with 50–200 Hz of line broadening; chemical shifts were referenced externally to the methylene (–CH2–) group of adamantane (Sigma) at δC = 38.48 ppm (30.Morcombe C.R.

The recycle delays at the beginning of the multiple CP experiments were 3 s, and the duration of the repolarization period was 0.8 s for the natural abundance pigments. Cross-polarization times of 1.0 ms with 10 recursive cycles were used for the multiple CP measurement, and 5000–6000 transients were acquired for natural abundance samples.

https://openalex.org/W2103930167,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are widely used in industry, but their environmental impacts on soil microbial communities are poorly known. In this paper, we compare the effect of both raw and acid treated or functionalized (fCNTs) multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on soil bacterial communities, applying different concentrations of MWCNTs (0 µg/g, 50 µg/g, 500 µg/g and 5000 µg/g) to a soil microcosm system. Soil DNA was extracted at 0, 2 and 8 weeks and the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was PCR-amplified and sequenced using paired-end Illumina bar-coded sequencing. The results show that bacterial diversity was not affected by either type of MWCNT. However, overall soil bacterial community composition, as illustrated by NMDS, was affected only by fMWCNT at high concentrations. This effect, detectable at 2 weeks, remained equally strong by 8 weeks. In the case of fMWCNTs, overall changes in relative abundance of the dominant phyla were also found. The stronger effect of fMWCNTs could be explained by their intrinsically acidic nature, as the soil pH was lower at higher concentrations of fMWCNTs. Overall, this study suggests that fMWCNTs may at least temporarily alter microbial community composition on the timescale of at least weeks to months. It appears, by contrast, that raw MWCNTs do not affect soil microbial community composition."

Similar studies on cells stably expressing an eGFP-tagged form of the epidermal growth factor receptor demonstrated that, although largely a monomer in the basal state, this receptor rapidly became predominantly dimeric upon the addition of its ligand epidermal growth factor. In cells induced to express an eGFP-tagged form of the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C (5-HT2C) receptor, global analysis of construct quantal brightness was consistent with the predominant form of the receptor being dimeric. However, detailed spatial intensity distribution analysis demonstrated the presence of multiple forms ranging from monomers to higher-order oligomers. Furthermore, treatment with chemically distinct 5-HT2C receptor antagonists resulted in a time-dependent change in the quaternary organization to one in which there was a preponderance of receptor monomers. This antagonist-mediated effect was reversible, because washout of the ligand resulted in the regeneration of many of the oligomeric forms of the receptor.

https://openalex.org/W2086115126,"Stored product beetles that are resistant to the fumigant pesticide phosphine (hydrogen phosphide) gas have been reported for more than 40 years in many places worldwide. Traditionally, determination of phosphine resistance in stored product beetles is based on a discriminating dose bioassay that can take up to two weeks to evaluate. We developed a diagnostic cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence method, CAPS, to detect individuals with alleles for strong resistance to phosphine in populations of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, and the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica, according to a single nucleotide mutation in the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) gene. We initially isolated and sequenced the DLD genes from susceptible and strongly resistant populations of both species. The corresponding amino acid sequences were then deduced. A single amino acid mutation in DLD in populations of T. castaneum and R. dominica with strong resistance was identified as P45S in T. castaneum and P49S in R. dominica, both collected from northern Oklahoma, USA. PCR products containing these mutations were digested by the restriction enzymes MboI and BstNI, which revealed presence or absence, respectively of the resistant (R) allele and allowed inference of genotypes with that allele. Seven populations of T. castaneum from Kansas were subjected to discriminating dose bioassays for the weak and strong resistance phenotypes. Application of CAPS to these seven populations confirmed the R allele was in high frequency in the strongly resistant populations, and was absent or at a lower frequency in populations with weak resistance, which suggests that these populations with a low frequency of the R allele have the potential for selection of the strong resistance phenotype. CAPS markers for strong phosphine resistance will help to detect and confirm resistant beetles and can facilitate resistance management actions against a given pest population."
https://openalex.org/W2005843619,"Anterograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) employing kinesin-2 molecular motors has been implicated in trafficking of photoreceptor outer segment proteins. We generated embryonic retina-specific (prefix emb) and adult tamoxifen-induced (prefix tam) deletions of KIF3a and IFT88 in adult mice to study photoreceptor ciliogenesis and protein trafficking. In (emb)Kif3a(-/-) and in (emb)Ift88(-/-) mice, basal bodies failed to extend transition zones (connecting cilia) with outer segments, and visual pigments mistrafficked. In contrast, (tam)Kif3a(-/-) and (tam)Ift88(-/-) photoreceptor axonemes disintegrated slowly post-induction, starting distally, but rhodopsin and cone pigments trafficked normally for more than 2 weeks, a time interval during which the outer segment is completely renewed. The results demonstrate that visual pigments transport to the retinal outer segment despite removal of KIF3 and IFT88, and KIF3-mediated anterograde IFT is responsible for photoreceptor transition zone and axoneme formation."
https://openalex.org/W1979114464,"Cities are a key system in anthropogenic phosphorus (P) cycling because they concentrate both P demand and waste production. Urban agriculture (UA) has been proposed as a means to improve P management by recycling cities' P-rich waste back into local food production. However, we have a limited understanding of the role UA currently plays in the P cycle of cities or its potential to recycle local P waste. Using existing data combined with surveys of local UA practitioners, we quantified the role of UA in the P cycle of Montreal, Canada to explore the potential for UA to recycle local P waste. We also used existing data to complete a substance flow analysis of P flows in the overall food system of Montreal. In 2012, Montreal imported 3.5 Gg of P in food, of which 2.63 Gg ultimately accumulated in landfills, 0.36 Gg were discharged to local waters, and only 0.09 Gg were recycled through composting. We found that UA is only a small sub-system in the overall P cycle of the city, contributing just 0.44% of the P consumed as food in the city. However, within the UA system, the rate of recycling is high: 73% of inputs applied to soil were from recycled sources. While a Quebec mandate to recycle 100% of all organic waste by 2020 might increase the role of UA in P recycling, the area of land in UA is too small to accommodate all P waste produced on the island. UA may, however, be a valuable pathway to improve urban P sustainability by acting as an activity that changes residents' relationship to, and understanding of, the food system and increases their acceptance of composting."
https://openalex.org/W2159726193,"Background Cytoreductive peritoneal surgery (CRS) associated with hyperthermic peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has long been considered the standard treatment for colorectal peritoneal metastases (CPM). However, although efficacy of surgery has been demonstrated, evidence supporting HIPEC’s role is less certain. Method Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and morbidity were analysed retrospectively for fifty consecutively included patients treated for colorectal CPM with complete CRS and systemic chemotherapy only. Results Median peritoneal cancer index (PCI) was 8 (range 1-24). 23 patients had liver or lung metastases (LLM). 22 patients had synchronous CPM. 27 complications occurred (12 Grade 1/2, 14 Grade 3, 1 Grade 4a, 0 Grade 5). Median follow-up was 62.5 months (95 %CI 45.4-81.3), median survival 32.4 months (21.5-41.7). Three- and 5-year OS were 45.5% (0.31-0.59) and 29.64% (0.17-0.44) respectively. Presence of LLMs associated with peritoneal carcinomatosis was significantly associated with poorer prognosis, with survival at 5 years of 13.95% (95 %CI 2.9-33.6) vs. 43.87% (22.2-63.7) when no metastases were present (P= 0.018). Median PFS was 9.5 months (95 %CI 6.2-11.1). Conclusion With an equivalent PCI range and despite one of the highest rates of LLM in the literature, our survival data of CRS + systemic chemotherapy only compare well with results reported after additional HIPEC. Tolerance was better with acceptable morbidity without any mortality. Extra-hepatic metastasis (LLM) is a strong factor of poor prognosis. Awaiting the results of the randomized PRODIGE trial, these results indicate that CRS + systemic chemotherapy only is a robust hypothesis to treat colorectal CPM."
https://openalex.org/W2042991436,"Shape is an important morphological characteristic both in animals and plants. In the present study, we examined a method for predicting biological contour shapes based on genome-wide marker polymorphisms. The method is expected to contribute to the acceleration of genetic improvement of biological shape via genomic selection. Grain shape variation observed in rice (Oryza sativa L.) germplasms was delineated using elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFDs), and was predicted based on genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes. We applied four methods including kernel PLS (KPLS) regression for building a prediction model of grain shape, and compared the accuracy of the methods via cross-validation. We analyzed multiple datasets that differed in marker density and sample size. Datasets with larger sample size and higher marker density showed higher accuracy. Among the four methods, KPLS showed the highest accuracy. Although KPLS and ridge regression (RR) had equivalent accuracy in a single dataset, the result suggested the potential of KPLS for the prediction of high-dimensional EFDs. Ordinary PLS, however, was less accurate than RR in all datasets, suggesting that the use of a non-linear kernel was necessary for accurate prediction using the PLS method. Rice grain shape can be predicted accurately based on genome-wide SNP genotypes. The proposed method is expected to be useful for genomic selection in biological shape."
https://openalex.org/W2039141644,"Dendritic cell (DC) vaccines are a newly emerging immunotherapeutic approach for the treatment and prevention of cancer, but major challenges still remain particularly with respect to clinical efficacy. Engineering and optimization of adjuvant formulations for DC-based vaccines is one strategy through which more efficacious treatments may be obtained. In this study, we developed a new ex vivo approach for DC vaccine preparation. We evaluated two highly purified mixed polysaccharide fractions from the root of Astragalus membranaceus and Codonopsis pilosulae, named Am and Cp, for their use in enhancing the efficiency of a DC-based cancer vaccine against metastasis of 4T1 mammary carcinoma in mice. Mixed lymphocyte reaction showed all Am-, Cp- and [Am+Cp]-treated DCs enhanced mouse CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell proliferation. [Am+Cp]-treated DCs exhibited the strongest anti-4T1 metastasis activity in test mice. Treatments with Am, Cp and [Am+Cp] also resulted in augmented expression of CD40, CD80 and CD86 markers in test DCs. Bioinformatics analysis of the cytokine array data from treated DCs identified that [Am+Cp] is efficacious in activation of specific immune functions via mediating the expression of cytokines/chemokines involved in the recruitment and differentiation of defined immune cells. Biochemical analysis revealed that Am and Cp are composed mainly of polysaccharides containing a high level (70–95%) glucose residues, but few or no (< 1%) mannose residues. In summary, our findings suggest that the specific plant polysaccharides Am and Cp extracted from traditional Chinese medicines can be effectively used instead of bacterial LPS as a potent adjuvant in the formulation of a DC-based vaccine for cancer immunotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W2050611885,"Autophagy is a regulated process that sequesters and transports cytoplasmic materials such as protein aggregates via autophagosomes to lysosomes for degradation. Dapper1 (Dpr1), an interacting protein of Dishevelled (Dvl), antagonizes Wnt signaling by promoting Dishevelled degradation via lysosomes. However, the mechanism is unclear. Here, we show that Dpr1 promotes the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL)-mediated ubiquitination of Dvl2 and its autophagic degradation. Knockdown of Dpr1 decreases the interaction between Dvl2 and pVHL, resulting in reduced ubiquitination of Dvl2. Dpr1-mediated autophagic degradation of Dvl2 depends on Dvl2 aggregation. Moreover, the aggregate-prone proteins Dvl2, p62, and the huntingtin mutant Htt103Q promote autophagy in a Dpr1-dependent manner. These protein aggregates enhance the Beclin1-Vps34 interaction and Atg14L puncta formation, indicating that aggregated proteins stimulate autophagy initiation. Ubiquitination is not essential for the aggregate-induced autophagy initiation as inhibition of the ubiquitin-activation E1 enzyme activity did not block the aggregate-induced Atg14L puncta formation. Our findings suggest that Dpr1 promotes the ubiquitination of Dvl2 by pVHL and mediates the protein aggregate-elicited autophagy initiation."

The inhibitory activity of rapid, reversible COX inhibitors (ibuprofen, naproxen, mefenamic acid, and lumiracoxib) demonstrated a significant increase in potency and time dependence of inhibition against double tryptophan murine COX-2 mutants at the 89/90 and 89/119 positions. In contrast, the slow, time-dependent COX inhibitors (diclofenac, indomethacin, and flurbiprofen) were unaffected by those mutations. Further mutagenesis studies suggested that mutation at position 89 was principally responsible for the changes in inhibitory potency of rapid, reversible inhibitors, whereas mutation at position 90 may exert some effect on the potency of COX-2-selective diarylheterocycle inhibitors; no effect was observed with mutation at position 119. Several crystal structures with or without NSAIDs indicated that placement of a bulky residue at position 89 caused a closure of a gap at the lobby, and alteration of histidine to tryptophan at position 90 changed the electrostatic profile of the side pocket of COX-2. Thus, these two residues, especially Val-89 at the lobby region, are crucial for the entrance and exit of some NSAIDs from the COX active site."

Conclusion: BA0330 and BA0331 stabilize the cell wall of B. anthracis. Significance: Understanding the mechanisms by which lipoproteins maintain cell wall integrity. Bacillus anthracis is a Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium and is the etiological agent of anthrax, a lethal disease sporadically affecting humans and animals. Its genome is similar to that of Bacillus cereus, although both pathogens occupy different ecological niches. The cell wall of B. anthracis is composed of peptidoglycan (PG), 3The abbreviations used are:PGpeptidoglycanPDApolysaccharide deacetylaseTEMtransmission electron microscopyBHIbrain-heart infusionSpcspectinomycinSEMscanning electron microscopyFn3fibronectin type 3. polysaccharides, proteins, and a poly-γ-d-glutamic acid capsule (1Fouet A. The surface of Bacillus anthracis.Mol. Aspects Med. 2009; 30: 374-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). PG is a heteropolymer made of GlcNAc and N-acetylmuramic acid containing glycan chains cross-linked by short peptides. The cell wall is the stress-bearing structure protecting the cell against lysis due to the osmotic pressure, therefore maintaining cell shape; and enzymes involved in synthesis, remodeling, and turnover of PG play crucial roles in cell growth and division (2Young K.D.

Gram-positive bacteria have developed mechanisms for retaining proteins within their cell envelope, including covalent linkage to PG and noncovalent binding to teichoic acids and other cell envelope polymers (3Navarre W.W.

Some Gram-negative bacteria covalently anchor an abundant outer membrane lipoprotein to PG to stabilize the cell envelope by forming tight connections between PG and the outer membrane (6Braun V. Wu H.C. Lipoproteins: structure, function, biosynthesis and model for protein export.New Comp. Biochem. 1994; 27: 319-341Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar).

Polysaccharide deacetylases (PDAs) belong to carbohydrate esterase family 4 (CE4), which includes chitin deacetylases, acetylxylan esterases, xylanases, rhizobial NodB chitooligosaccharide deacetylases, and PG deacetylases. Members of this family catalyze the hydrolysis of either the N-linked acetyl group from GlcNAc residues (chitin deacetylase, NodB, and peptidoglycan GlcNAc deacetylase) (10Vollmer W. Tomasz A.

Interestingly, the genomes of Bacillus sp., and especially of B. cereus sensu lato, including B. anthracis, contain multiple putative polysaccharide deacetylase genes with high sequence homologies. The physiological role of five PDAs in B. anthracis has been recently elucidated. BA1977 associated with lateral PG synthesis is the only deacetylase involved in resistance to host lysozyme and is required for full virulence. BA1961 and BA3679 deacetylate PG during both cell division and elongation, whereas BA5436 and BA2944 are important for PG attachment of neutral polysaccharide, which anchors S-layer proteins, and for polysaccharide modification, respectively (15Balomenou S.

Most of the structures contain a divalent ion in the active site bound in a His-His-Asp triad. The catalytic machinery is completed by an aspartic acid and a histidine that act as the catalytic base and catalytic acid, respectively (16Blair D.E. Schüttelkopf A.W. MacRae J.I. van Aalten D.M.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15429-15434Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Five conserved sequence motifs are required for activity of the CE4 NodB domain. The first Asp residue of motif 1 (TFDD) is believed to act as the catalytic base, which activates the catalytic water, and the second Asp coordinates the metal ion. motif 2 (H(S/T)XXH) contributes the two His residues, which coordinate the metal. motif 3 (RpPXG) contributes a conserved Arg residue that coordinates the catalytic base and a strictly conserved Pro residue. The catalytic acid is a His residue, which lies in motif 5 and is coordinated by an Asp residue provided by motif 4 (16Blair D.E. Schüttelkopf A.W. MacRae J.I. van Aalten D.M.

Furthermore, BA0330 shares 91% identity with its corresponding homologue BC0361 from B. cereus, whereas a homologue of BA0331, which is present in all B. anthracis strains, is missing in many B. cereus strains, including B. cereus ATCC 14579. BA0331 is mainly expressed during the exponential phase but is secreted at lower amounts during the stationary phase, in both the avirulent B. anthracis UM23C1-2 (pXO1- and pXO2-) and the wild-type virulent Vollum strain (25Antelmann H.

In this study, we employed biochemical and genetic (knock-out) analysis, structure determination, and protein localization to elucidate the biological roles of BA0330 and BA0331 from the avirulent B. anthracis UM23C1-2 strain. We show that BA0330 and BA0331 interact with PG and stabilize the cell wall of B. anthracis. Furthermore, BA0331 is important for maintenance of the cell shape, and BA0330 contributes to the adaptation of the bacterium to high salt stress. The structure of BA0330 reveals a differentiation of the catalytic machinery of PDAs and could explain the apparent lack of activity of this protein. To our knowledge, this is the first report of lipoproteins implicated in the maintenance of cell wall integrity in Gram-positive bacteria.

Primers were synthesized to exclude the signal peptide (1–23 amino acids) and to incorporate a blunt end at the start and an XhoI site at the end of ba0330 and ba0331 genes. The amplified genes were purified, digested with the corresponding enzymes, and ligated into pRSET A vector. The resulting products were in-frame, non-His6 tag-fused constructs in pRSET A for ba0330 and ba0331 genes, placing the PDA genes under the transcriptional control of the T7 lac promoter. The two constructs were transformed into BL21(DE3) (pLys) E. coli strains. Twenty milliliters of saturated culture of each of the transformed deacetylase expression strains were inoculated into 1 liter of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin and 34 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol as antibiotics and incubated at 37 °C on a shaker incubator to an A600 of 0.6. BA0330 E. coli culture was transferred to 20 °C after addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, and BA0331 E. coli culture was transferred to 30 °C after addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. For BA0330, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.6, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.3 mg ml−1 lysozyme. After 150 min of incubation at 4 °C, the suspension was centrifuged, and soluble fractions were collected and loaded onto an SP-Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography column equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 6.8.

Fractions containing BA0330 were collected and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-200 HR column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 300 mm NaCl. Fractions containing BA0330 were collected, concentrated, and stored at 4 °C. For BA0331, all steps prior to chromatographic purification of BA0331 were the same as described previously for BA0330. Subsequently, soluble fractions containing BA0331 were loaded onto a Source Q HR adsorbent equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Proteins were eluted using a step gradient of NaCl (300 mm).

BA0330 crystallization screening was set up using an Oryx4 crystallization robot (Douglas Instruments Ltd.) with the vapor diffusion method in sitting drops. Protein crystals appeared only in one out of ∼700 conditions tested and were subsequently optimized to produce crystals suitable for diffraction experiments. The best crystals were grown after mixing equal volumes of protein solution (concentrated at 20 mg ml−1) and mother liquor consisting of 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 20% w/v PEG 3350. The crystals appeared within 4–7 days reaching their final size in 2 weeks at 16 °C.

To isolate a double-crossover recombinant Spc-resistant strain, transformants were grown in BHI medium with Spc for 2 days, diluted 1:1,000 every 12 h, and then shifted to BHI medium without antibiotic to facilitate clearance of autonomous plasmids. The culture was diluted 1:1,000 in fresh medium every 12 h for several days and then plated onto BHI agar with Spc. Colonies were patch-plated to score clones for Spc resistance and erythromycin sensitivity. Δba0330, Δba0331, and Δba0330/Δba0331 in B. anthracis were also confirmed by PCR amplification. Complementation studies were carried out as follows. The genes were amplified from genomic DNA of B. anthracis UM23C1-2 using DNA polymerase chain reaction. Primers were synthesized to incorporate a KpnI site at the start and a BglII site at the end of ba0330 and ba0331 genes. The amplified genes were purified, digested with the corresponding enzymes, and ligated into pWH1520 vector (36Rygus T. Hillen W.

https://openalex.org/W2075315924,"PPM1D phosphatase, also called wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1, promotes tumor development by inactivating the p53 tumor suppressor pathway. RBM38 RNA-binding protein, also called RNPC1 and a target of p53, inhibits p53 messenger RNA (mRNA) translation, which can be reversed by GSK3 protein kinase via phosphorylation of RBM38 at serine 195. Here we showed that ectopic expression of RBM38 increases, whereas knockdown of RBM38 inhibits, PPM1D mRNA translation. Consistent with this, we found that RBM38 directly binds to PPM1D 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) and promotes expression of a heterologous reporter gene that carries PPM1D 3′-UTR in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, we showed that PPM1D directly interacts with and dephosphorylates RBM38 at serine 195. Furthermore, we showed that PPM1D modulates p53 mRNA translation and p53-dependent growth suppression through dephosphorylation of RBM38. These findings provide evidence that the crosstalk between PPM1D and RBM38, both of which are targets and modulators of p53, has a critical role in p53 expression and activity."
https://openalex.org/W2090339800,"Disordered eating and eating disorders are of great concern due to their associations with physical and mental health risks. Even if adolescence has been identified as the most vulnerable time for developing disordered eating, few studies have used a broad spectrum of criteria to investigate the prevalence of disordered eating among high school students of both genders, in different programs of study, nor assessed correlates of disordered eating among this important target group. The purposes of this study were therefore to investigate the prevalence and correlates of disordered eating among both male and female high school students in sport-, general and vocational programs. A comprehensive questionnaire was completed by 2,451 students (98.7%), aged 15–17 years. The total prevalence of disordered eating was 54.9%, with 64.3% among girls and 45.0% among boys (p<0.001). The highest prevalence of disordered eating was found among vocational students (60.7%), followed by students in general programs (49.8%) and sport students (38.3%) (p<0.001). Female gender, school program (vocational and general), overweight/obesity and weight regulation were positively associated with disordered eating. The high prevalence indicates the importance of tailored prevention efforts directed at high school students, particularly in vocational programs. Furthermore, a smaller girls–boys ratio than expected indicates that the efforts to identify and manage disordered eating among high school students should include both genders."

Both aptamers had whole-virus binding affinity. Also, an enzyme-linked aptamer assay (ELAA) confirmed binding affinity and specificity against other AIV subtypes. Finally, we studied aptamer-inhibitory effects on H9N2 AIV infection in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and quantified viral load in supernatant and in cell with quantitative PCR (qPCR). Our data provide a foundation for future development of innovative anti-influenza drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2010301896,"Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SAD), locating in the plastid stroma, is an important fatty acid biosynthetic enzyme in higher plants. SAD catalyzes desaturation of stearoyl-ACP to oleyl-ACP and plays a key role in determining the homeostasis between saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids, which is an important player in cold acclimation in plants. Here, four new full-length cDNA of SADs (ScoSAD, SaSAD, ScaSAD and StSAD) were cloned from four Solanum species, Solanum commersonii, S. acaule, S. cardiophyllum and S. tuberosum, respectively. The ORF of the four SADs were 1182 bp in length, encoding 393 amino acids. A sequence alignment indicated 13 amino acids varied among the SADs of three wild species. Further analysis showed that the freezing tolerance and cold acclimation capacity of S. commersonii are similar to S. acaule and their SAD amino acid sequences were identical but differed from that of S. cardiophyllum, which is sensitive to freezing. Furthermore, the sequence alignments between StSAD and ScoSAD indicated that only 7 different amino acids at residues were found in SAD of S. tuberosum (Zhongshu8) against the protein sequence of ScoSAD. A phylogenetic analysis showed the three wild potato species had the closest genetic relationship with the SAD of S. lycopersicum and Nicotiana tomentosiformis but not S. tuberosum. The SAD gene from S. commersonii (ScoSAD) was cloned into multiple sites of the pBI121 plant binary vector and transformed into the cultivated potato variety Zhongshu 8. A freeze tolerance analysis showed overexpression of the ScoSAD gene in transgenic plants significantly enhanced freeze tolerance in cv. Zhongshu 8 and increased their linoleic acid content, suggesting that linoleic acid likely plays a key role in improving freeze tolerance in potato plants. This study provided some new insights into how SAD regulates in the freezing tolerance and cold acclimation in potato."
https://openalex.org/W2079161799,"Whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing were used to discover novel gene fusions in a case of colon cancer. A tumor-specific LACTB2-NCOA2 fusion originating from intra-chromosomal rearrangement of chromosome 8 was identified at both DNA and RNA levels. Unlike conventional oncogenic chimeric proteins, the fusion product lacks functional domain from respective genes, indicative of an amorphic rearrangement. This chimeric LACTB2-NCOA2 transcript was detected in 6 out of 99 (6.1%) colorectal cancer (CRC) cases, where NCOA2 was significantly downregulated. Enforced expression of wild-type NCOA2 but not the LACTB2-NCOA2 fusion protein impaired the pro-tumorigenic phenotypes of CRC cells, whereas knockdown of endogenous NCOA2 in normal colonocytes had opposite effects. Mechanistically, NCOA2 inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling through simultaneously upregulating inhibitors and downregulating stimulators of Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Collectively, our data supports that NCOA2 is a novel negative growth regulatory gene repressing the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in CRC, where recurrent fusion with LACTB2 contributes to its disruption."
https://openalex.org/W2019598092,"Adaptation of insect phenotypes for survival after exposure to xenobiotics can result from selection at multiple loci with additive genetic effects. To the authors' knowledge, no selective sweep analysis has been performed to identify such loci in highly dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) resistant insects. Here we compared a highly DDT resistant phenotype in the Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila) 91-R strain to the DDT susceptible 91-C strain, both of common origin. Whole genome re-sequencing data from pools of individuals was generated separately for 91-R and 91-C, and mapped to the reference Drosophila genome assembly (v. 5.72). Thirteen major and three minor effect chromosome intervals with reduced nucleotide diversity (π) were identified only in the 91-R population. Estimates of Tajima's D (D) showed corresponding evidence of directional selection in these same genome regions of 91-R, however, no similar reductions in π or D estimates were detected in 91-C. An overabundance of non-synonymous proteins coding to synonymous changes were identified in putative open reading frames associated with 91-R. Except for NinaC and Cyp4g1, none of the identified genes were the 'usual suspects' previously observed to be associated with DDT resistance. Additionally, up-regulated ATP-binding cassette transporters have been previously associated with DDT resistance; however, here we identified a structurally altered MDR49 candidate resistance gene. The remaining fourteen genes have not previously been shown to be associated with DDT resistance. These results suggest hitherto unknown mechanisms of DDT resistance, most of which have been overlooked in previous transcriptional studies, with some genes having orthologs in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2093563571,"The multifaceted oncogene c-Myc plays important roles in the development and progression of human cancer. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that the p19Arf–Mdm2–p53 and the ribosomal protein (RP)–Mdm2–p53 pathways are both essential in preventing oncogenic c-Myc-induced tumorigenesis. Disruption of each pathway individually by p19Arf deletion or by Mdm2C305F mutation, which disrupts RP-Mdm2 binding, accelerates Eμ-myc transgene-induced pre-B/B-cell lymphoma in mice at seemingly similar paces with median survival around 10 and 11 weeks, respectively, compared to 20 weeks for Eμ-myc transgenic mice. Because p19Arf can inhibit ribosomal biogenesis through its interaction with nucleophosmin (NPM/B23), RNA helicase DDX5 and RNA polymerase I transcription termination factor (TTF-I), it has been speculated that the p19Arf–Mdm2–p53 and the RP–Mdm2–p53 pathways might be a single p19Arf–RP–Mdm2–p53 pathway, in which p19Arf activates p53 by inhibiting RP biosynthesis; thus, p19Arf deletion or Mdm2C305F mutation would result in similar consequences. Here, we generated mice with concurrent p19Arf deletion and Mdm2C305F mutation and investigated the compound mice for tumorigenesis in the absence and the presence of oncogenic c-Myc overexpression. In the absence of Eμ-myc transgene, the Mdm2C305F mutation did not elicit spontaneous tumors in mice, nor did it accelerate spontaneous tumors in mice with p19Arf deletion. In the presence of Eμ-myc transgene, however, Mdm2C305F mutation significantly accelerated p19Arf deletion-induced lymphomagenesis and promoted rapid metastasis. We found that when p19Arf–Mdm2–p53 and RP–Mdm2–p53 pathways are independently disrupted, oncogenic c-Myc-induced p53 stabilization and activation is only partially attenuated. When both pathways are concurrently disrupted, however, c-Myc-induced p53 stabilization and activation are essentially obliterated. Thus, the p19Arf–Mdm2–p53 and the RP–Mdm2–p53 are non-redundant pathways possessing similar capabilities to activate p53 upon c-Myc overexpression."

Here we identify the Ssy1-Ptr3-Ssy5 (SPS) amino acid sensing pathway as a novel longevity factor. A null mutation of SSY5 (ssy5Δ) increases replicative life span (RLS) by ∼50%. Our results demonstrate that several NAD+ homeostasis factors play key roles in this life span extension. First, expression of the putative malate-pyruvate NADH shuttle increases in ssy5Δ cells, and deleting components of this shuttle, MAE1 and OAC1, largely abolishes RLS extension. Next, we show that Stp1, a transcription factor of the SPS pathway, directly binds to the promoter of MAE1 and OAC1 to regulate their expression. Additionally, deletion of SSY5 increases nicotinamide riboside (NR) levels and phosphate-responsive (PHO) signaling activity, suggesting that ssy5Δ increases NR salvaging. This increase contributes to NAD+ homeostasis, partially ameliorating the NAD+ deficiency and rescuing the short life span of the npt1Δ mutant. Moreover, we observed that vacuolar phosphatase, Pho8, is partially required for ssy5Δ-mediated NR increase and RLS extension.

https://openalex.org/W2134286858,"Little information is available on the impact of hemodialysis on cerebral water homeostasis and its distribution in chronic kidney disease. We used a neuropsychological test battery, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a novel technique for quantitative measurement of localized water content using 3T MRI to investigate ten hemodialysis patients (HD) on a dialysis-free day and after hemodialysis (2.4±2.2 hours), and a matched healthy control group with the same time interval. Neuropsychological testing revealed mainly attentional and executive cognitive dysfunction in HD. Voxel-based-morphometry showed only marginal alterations in the right inferior medial temporal lobe white matter in HD compared to controls. Marked increases in global brain water content were found in the white matter, specifically in parietal areas, in HD patients compared to controls. Although the global water content in the gray matter did not differ between the two groups, regional increases of brain water content in particular in parieto-temporal gray matter areas were observed in HD patients. No relevant brain hydration changes were revealed before and after hemodialysis. Whereas longer duration of dialysis vintage was associated with increased water content in parieto-temporal-occipital regions, lower intradialytic weight changes were negatively correlated with brain water content in these areas in HD patients. Worse cognitive performance on an attention task correlated with increased hydration in frontal white matter. In conclusion, long-term HD is associated with altered brain tissue water homeostasis mainly in parietal white matter regions, whereas the attentional domain in the cognitive dysfunction profile in HD could be linked to increased frontal white matter water content."
https://openalex.org/W2028903312,"Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of motorcycle to car transitioning and urbanisation on traffic injury rates in Thailand. Design Analysis of two consecutive surveys of a large national cohort study. Setting Thailand. Participants The data derived from 57,154 Thai Cohort Study (TCS) participants who provided relevant data on both the 2005 and 2009 surveys. Primary and secondary outcome measures Motorcycle and car traffic crash injury self-reported in 2009, with twelve months’ recall. Results In 2009, 5608(10%) participants reported a traffic crash injury. Most crashes involved a motorcycle (74%). Car access increased and motorcycle use decreased between 2005 and 2009. Among those who used a motorcycle at both time points, traffic injury incidence was 2.8 times greater compared to those who did not use a motorcycle at either time point. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to test longitudinal and cross sectional factors associated with traffic crash injury: in the adjusted model, cars were negatively and motorcycles positively associated with injury. Living in an urban area was not injury protective in the adjusted model of traffic crash injury. Conclusions Ongoing urbanisation in Thailand can be expected to lead to further reductions in road traffic injuries based on transition from motorcycles to cars in urban areas. Cities, however, do not provide an intrinsically safer traffic environment. To accommodate a safe transition to car use in Thailand, traffic infrastructural changes anticipating the growing car density in urban areas is warranted."

To study the use of trace amounts of DOM by the facultatively oligotrophic Pseudovibrio sp. FO-BEG1, we investigated the composition of artificial and natural seawater before and after growth. We determined the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), free and hydrolysable amino acids, and the molecular composition of DOM by electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR-MS). The DOC concentration of the artificial seawater we used for cultivation was 4.4 μmol C L-1, which was eight times lower compared to the natural oligotrophic seawater we used for parallel experiments (36 μmol C L -1). During the three-week duration of the experiment, cell numbers increased from 40 cells mL-1 to 2x104 cells mL -1 in artificial and to 3x105 cells mL -1 in natural seawater. No nitrogen fixation and minor CO2 fixation (< 1% of cellular carbon) was observed. Our data show that in both media, amino acids were not the main substrate for growth. Instead, FT-ICR-MS analysis revealed usage of a variety of different dissolved organic molecules, belonging to a wide range of chemical compound groups, also containing nitrogen. The present study shows that marine heterotrophic bacteria are able to proliferate with even lower DOC concentrations than available in natural ultra-oligotrophic seawater, using unexpected organic compounds to fuel their energy, carbon and nitrogen requirements."
https://openalex.org/W1976861199,"The devising of efficient concerted rotation moves that modify only selected local portions of chain molecules is a long studied problem. Possible applications range from speeding the uncorrelated sampling of polymeric dense systems to loop reconstruction and structure refinement in protein modeling. Here, we propose and validate, on a few pedagogical examples, a novel numerical strategy that generalizes the notion of concerted rotation. The usage of the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters for chain description allows all possible choices for the subset of degrees of freedom to be modified in the move. They can be arbitrarily distributed along the chain and can be distanced between consecutive monomers as well. The efficiency of the methodology capitalizes on the inherent geometrical structure of the manifold defined by all chain configurations compatible with the fixed degrees of freedom. The chain portion to be moved is first opened along a direction chosen in the tangent space to the manifold, and then closed in the orthogonal space. As a consequence, in Monte Carlo simulations detailed balance is easily enforced without the need of using Jacobian reweighting. Moreover, the relative fluctuations of the degrees of freedom involved in the move can be easily tuned. We show different applications: the manifold of possible configurations is explored in a very efficient way for a protein fragment and for a cyclic molecule; the “local backbone volume”, related to the volume spanned by the manifold, reproduces the mobility profile of all-α helical proteins; the refinement of small protein fragments with different secondary structures is addressed. The presented results suggest our methodology as a valuable exploration and sampling tool in the context of bio-molecular simulations."

Catalytic activity of ADAMs and their predicted potential for Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain binding show a strong correlation. Here we present a comprehensive characterization of SH3 binding capacity and preferences of the catalytically active ADAMs 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, and 19. Our results revealed several novel interactions, and also confirmed many previously reported ones. Many of the identified SH3 interaction partners were shared by several ADAMs, whereas some were ADAM-specific. Most of the ADAM-interacting SH3 proteins were adapter proteins or kinases, typically associated with sorting and endocytosis. Novel SH3 interactions revealed in this study include TOCA1 and CIP4 as preferred partners of ADAM8, and RIMBP1 as a partner of ADAM19. Our results suggest that common as well as distinct mechanisms are involved in regulation and execution of ADAM signaling, and provide a useful framework for addressing the pathways that connect ADAMs to normal and aberrant cell behavior."

However, the exact mechanism underlying the high level of antibody formation is not fully understood. In our study, we provide evidence for the functional role of the liver and the stimulation of plasma cell proliferation in hyperimmunoglobulinemia. We collected sera from patients with chronic liver diseases, and the level of serum immunoglobulins in patients was examined; this was also investigated in animal models of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. An end-to-side microsurgical portacaval shunt was used to mimic liver dysfunction in rats. We used portal vein serum and inferior vena cava serum to immunize healthy rats and mice in order to confirm the function of the healthy liver in disposing of antigens and endotoxins from the gut. For the analysis of the state of plasma cell activation, plasma cells from mice were stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD138 and FITC-conjugated anti-BrdU for flow cytometry analysis. Hyperimmunoglobulinemia was observed both in patients with chronic liver diseases and in related animal models, and high plasma LPS levels were also observed. There was a significant increase in the activation and proliferation of plasma cell in mice immunized with antigens or LPS-positive serum compared with controls that were immunized with antigens and LPS-negative serum. We confirmed that the healthy liver plays an important role in disposing of antigens and endotoxins derived from the gut. Hyperimmunoglobulinemia in chronic liver diseases mainly arises due to the collateral circulation secondary to portal hypertension, gut antigens and endotoxins that bypass the liver and reach the antibody-producing cells."

Mortality rates remain high among patients with advanced stage disease and esophagectomy is associated with high complication rates. Hence, early identification of potentially metastatic disease would better guide treatment strategies.The modified Levrat's surgery was performed to induce EAC in Sprague-Dawley rats. Primary EAC and distant metastatic sites were confirmed via histology and immunofluorescence. miRNA profiling was performed on primary tumors with or without metastasis. A unique subset of miRNAs expressed in primary tumors and metastases was identified with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) along with upstream and downstream targets. miRNA-linked gene expression analysis was performed on a secondary cohort of metastasis positive (n=5) and metastasis negative (n=28) primary tumors.The epithelial origin of distant metastasis was established by IF using villin (VIL1) and mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) antibodies. miRNome analysis identified four down-regulated miRNAs in metastasis positive primary tumors compared to metastasis negative tumors: miR-92a-3p (p=0.0001), miR-141-3p (p=0.0022), miR-451-1a (p=0.0181) and miR133a-3p (p=0.0304). Six target genes identified in the top scoring networks by IPA were validated as significantly, differentially expressed in metastasis positive primary tumors: Ago2, Akt1, Kras, Bcl2L11, CDKN1B and Zeb2.In vivo metastasis was confirmed in the modified Levrat's model.

https://openalex.org/W1982325415,"Potato common scab is an economically important crop disease that is characterized by the formation of superficial, raised or pitted lesions on the potato tuber surface. The most widely distributed causative agent of the disease is Streptomyces scabies, which produces the phytotoxic secondary metabolite thaxtomin A that serves as a key virulence factor for the organism. Recently, it was demonstrated that S. scabies can also produce the phytotoxic secondary metabolite coronafacoyl-L-isoleucine (CFA-L-Ile) as well as other related metabolites in minor amounts. The expression of the biosynthetic genes for CFA-L-Ile production is dependent on a PAS-LuxR family transcriptional regulator, CfaR, which is encoded within the phytotoxin biosynthetic gene cluster in S. scabies. In this study, we show that CfaR activates coronafacoyl phytotoxin production by binding to a single site located immediately upstream of the putative -35 hexanucleotide box within the promoter region for the biosynthetic genes. The binding activity of CfaR was shown to require both the LuxR and PAS domains, the latter of which is involved in protein homodimer formation. We also show that CFA-L-Ile production is greatly enhanced in S. scabies by overexpression of both cfaR and a downstream co-transcribed gene, orf1. Our results provide important insight into the regulation of coronafacoyl phytotoxin production, which is thought to contribute to the virulence phenotype of S. scabies. Furthermore, we provide evidence that CfaR is a novel member of the PAS-LuxR family of regulators, members of which are widely distributed among actinomycete bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2148834075,"The cossid moth (Coryphodema tristis) has a broad range of native tree hosts in South Africa. The moth recently moved into non-native Eucalyptus plantations in South Africa, on which it now causes significant damage. Here we investigate the chemicals involved in pheromone communication between the sexes of this moth in order to better understand its ecology, and with a view to potentially develop management tools for it. In particular, we characterize female gland extracts and headspace samples through coupled gas chromatography electro-antennographic detection (GC-EAD) and two dimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCxGC-MS). Tentative identities of the potential pheromone compounds were confirmed by comparing both retention time and mass spectra with authentic standards. Two electrophysiologically active pheromone compounds, tetradecyl acetate (14:OAc) and Z9-tetradecenyl acetate (Z9-14:OAc) were identified from pheromone gland extracts, and an additional compound (Z9-14:OH) from headspace samples. We further determined dose response curves for the identified compounds and six other structurally similar compounds that are common to the order Cossidae. Male antennae showed superior sensitivity toward Z9-14:OAc, Z7-tetradecenyl acetate (Z7-14:OAc), E9-tetradecenyl acetate (E9-14:OAc), Z9-tetradecenol (Z9-14:OH) and Z9-tetradecenal (Z9-14:Ald) when compared to female antennae. While we could show electrophysiological responses to single pheromone compounds, behavioral attraction of males was dependent on the synergistic effect of at least two of these compounds. Signal specificity is shown to be gained through pheromone blends. A field trial showed that a significant number of males were caught only in traps baited with a combination of Z9-14:OAc (circa 95% of the ratio) and Z9-14:OH. Addition of 14:OAc to this mixture also improved the number of males caught, although not significantly. This study represents a major step towards developing a useful attractant to be used in management tools for C. tristis and contributes to the understanding of chemical communication and biology of this group of insects."
https://openalex.org/W1965622447,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) plays a pivotal role in regulating metabolic response to fasting and is an inhibitor of inflammatory pathways in immune cells. It represents a therapeutic target for treatment of several diseases, mainly hyperlipidemia. To shed light on PPARα expression changes in response to fasting, young healthy male and female volunteers were fed or fasted for 24 hours. Monocytes were analyzed every 2 hours to compile both profiles of mRNA and protein expression of PPARα and its interactive partner, the circadian pacemaker brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator like-1 (BMAL1). We found that women change their diurnal expression profiles of PPARα and BMAL1 when switching from the fed to the fasted state, whereas men do not. Interestingly, the PPARα and BMAL1 profiles of men and women in the fed state are different, whereas the profiles in the fasted state are virtually identical. The finding of diametrically opposite responses of male and female PPARα expression in the fed state might have practical implication in human medicine as PPARα activators like fibrates are used for the therapy of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, microvascular complications in diabetes, and kidney diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1965732649,"Obesity associated with a sedentary lifestyle can lead to changes in the immune system balance resulting in the development of inflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to compare lymphocyte activation mechanisms between overweight children practicing regular circus physical exercises with non-exercised children. The study comprised 60 pubescent children randomly divided into 4 groups: Overweight Children (OWC) (10.67 ± 0.22 years old), Overweight Exercised Children (OWE) (10.00 ± 0.41 years old), Eutrophic Children (EC) (11.00 ± 0.29 years old) and Eutrophic Exercised Children (EE) (10.60 ± 0.29 years old). OWE and EE groups practiced circus activities twice a week, for 4.3 ± 0.5 and 4.4 ± 0.5 months, respectively. Percentage of T regulatory cells (Treg) and the expression of CD95 and CD25 in CD4+ lymphocytes were evaluated by flow cytometry. Lymphocyte proliferation capacity was measured by [14C]-thymidine incorporation and mRNA expression of IL-35, TGF-beta, IL-2 and IL-10 by real-time PCR. Lymphocyte proliferation was higher in OWC and OWE groups compared with the EC (3509 ± 887; 2694 ± 560, and 1768 ± 208 cpm, respectively) and EE (2313 ± 111 cpm) groups. CD95 expression on lymphocytes was augmented in the EC (953.9 ± 101.2) and EE groups (736.7 ± 194.6) compared with the OWC (522.1 ± 125.2) and OWE groups (551.6 ± 144.5). CTLA-4 expression was also lower in the OWC and OWE groups compared with the EC and EE groups. Percentage of Treg, IL-35, and IL-10 mRNA expression were lower in the OWC and OWE groups compared with the EC and EE groups. In conclusion, overweight children present altered immune system balance characterized by elevated lymphocyte proliferation due to a decrease in T regulatory cell percentage. These effects were partially reverted by moderate physical exercise, as demonstrated by decreased lymphocyte proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2027146933,"Hydrogen is a promising future energy source. Although the ability of green algae to produce hydrogen has long been recognized (since 1939) and several biotechnological applications have been attempted, the greatest obstacle, being the O2-sensitivity of the hydrogenase enzyme, has not yet been overcome. In the present contribution, 75 years after the first report on algal hydrogen production, taking advantage of a natural mechanism of oxygen balance, we demonstrate high hydrogen yields by lichens. Lichens have been selected as the ideal organisms in nature for hydrogen production, since they consist of a mycobiont and a photobiont in symbiosis. It has been hypothesized that the mycobiont’s and photobiont’s consumption of oxygen (increase of COX and AOX proteins of mitochondrial respiratory pathways and PTOX protein of chrolorespiration) establishes the required anoxic conditions for the activation of the phycobiont’s hydrogenase in a closed system. Our results clearly supported the above hypothesis, showing that lichens have the ability to activate appropriate bioenergetic pathways depending on the specific incubation conditions. Under light conditions, they successfully use the PSII-dependent and the PSII-independent pathways (decrease of D1 protein and parallel increase of PSaA protein) to transfer electrons to hydrogenase, while under dark conditions, lichens use the PFOR enzyme and the dark fermentative pathway to supply electrons to hydrogenase. These advantages of lichen symbiosis in combination with their ability to survive in extreme environments (while in a dry state) constitute them as unique and valuable hydrogen producing natural factories and pave the way for future biotechnological applications."
https://openalex.org/W2025779495,"Background The transition to retirement introduces a decline in total physical activity and an increase in TV viewing time. Nonetheless, as more time becomes available, early retirement is an ideal stage to implement health interventions. Therefore, knowledge on specific determinants of physical activity and sedentary time is needed. Former work-related physical activity has been proposed as a potential determinant, but concrete evidence is lacking. The aim of this study was to examine if former work-related sitting, standing, walking or vigorous activities predict physical activity and sedentary time during early retirement. Additionally, moderating effects of educational level and physical functioning were examined. Methods In total, 392 recently retired Belgian adults (>6 months, <5 years) completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, the SF-36 Health Survey and a questionnaire on sociodemographics and former work-related activities. Generalized linear regression analyses were conducted in R. Moderating effects were examined by adding cross-products to the models. Results More former work-related sitting was predictive of more screen time during retirement. Lower levels of former work-related vigorous activities and higher levels of former work-related walking were associated with respectively more cycling for transport and more walking for transport during retirement. None of the predictors significantly explained passive transportation, cycling and walking for recreation, and leisure-time moderate-to-vigorous physical activity during retirement. Several moderating effects were found, but the direction of the interactions was not univocal. Conclusions Former-work related behaviors are of limited importance to explain physical activity during early retirement, so future studies should focus on other individual, social and environmental determinants. Nonetheless, adults who previously had a sedentary job had higher levels of screen time during retirement, so this is an important subgroup to focus on during interventions. Because of the inconsistent moderating effects of educational level and physical functioning, no clear recommendations can be formulated."
https://openalex.org/W2073271924,"In macrophages the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) modulates production of inflammatory cytokines, cholesterol accumulation and lipoprotein uptake. Recently, our laboratory showed that selective stimulation of the α7nAChR protects macrophages from apoptosis, an effect that is absent in α7nAChR-deficient macrophages. All these observations are suggestive of a potential role of macrophage α7nAChR in atherosclerosis. Mouse models of the disease with bone marrow deletion of α7nAChR represent an attractive approach to address the in vivo relevance of these in vitro findings. However, recent studies that focused on the impact of hematopoietic deficiency of α7nAChR on early atherosclerotic lesions of low density lipoprotein receptor knockout (LDLRKO) mice, yielded controversial results. The question also remained whether macrophage α7nAChR modulates the characteristics of advanced lesions. Here we used LDLR knockout mice transplanted with bone marrow from wild-type or α7nAChR knockout animals to revisit the effect of hematopoietic deficiency of α7nAChR on early lesions and to examine, for the first time, its impact on advanced plaques. Aortic sinus atherosclerotic lesions were analyzed following 8 and 14 weeks on a high fat diet. Early lesions in mice with α7nAChR deficient bone marrow were not different from those in control animals. However, advanced lesions of mice with bone marrow deletion of α7nAChR exhibited reduction in size, macrophage content and cell proliferation. These studies are the first in examining the impact of hematopoietic deficiency of α7nAChR on the characteristics of advanced atherosclerotic lesions in a mouse model of the disease and provide novel evidence underscoring a potential pro-atherogenic role of macrophage α7nAChR."
https://openalex.org/W2079004605,"The human pathogen Neisseria meningitides (Nm) attains serum resistance via a number of mechanisms, one of which involves binding to the host complement regulator protein vitronectin. We have shown previously that the Meningococcal surface fibril (Msf), a trimeric autotransporter, binds to the activated form of vitronectin (aVn) to increase Nm survival in human serum. In this study, we aimed to identify the aVn-binding region of Msf to assess its potential as an antigen which can elicit antibodies that block aVn binding and/or possess bactericidal properties. Using several recombinant Msf fragments spanning its surface-exposed region, the smallest aVn-binding recombinants were found to span residues 1-86 and 39-124. The use of further deletion constructs and overlapping recombinant Msf fragments suggested that a region of Msf comprising residues 39-82 may be primarily important for aVn binding and that other regions may also be involved but to a lesser extent. Molecular modelling implicated K66 and K68, conserved in all available Msf sequences, to be involved in the interaction. Recombinant fragments which bound to aVn were able to reduce the survival advantage conveyed by aVn-interaction in serum bactericidal assays. Antibodies raised against one such fragment inhibited aVn binding to Msf. In addition, the antibodies enhanced specific killing of Msf-expressing Nm in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, this study identifies an aVn-binding region of Msf, an adhesin known to impart serum resistance properties to the pathogen; and shows that this region of Msf can elicit antibodies with dual properties which reduce pathogen survival within the host and thus has potential as a vaccine antigen."
https://openalex.org/W2078414323,"The present study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate deficits in error-monitoring by college students with schizotypal traits. Scores on the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) were used to categorize the participants into schizotypal-trait (n = 17) and normal control (n = 20) groups. The error-monitoring abilities of the participants were evaluated using the Simon task, which consists of congruent (locations of stimulus and response are the same) and incongruent (locations of stimulus and response are different) conditions. The schizotypal-trait group committed more errors on the Simon task and exhibited smaller error-related negativity (ERN) amplitudes than did the control group. Additionally, ERN amplitude measured at FCz was negatively correlated with the error rate on the Simon task in the schizotypal-trait group but not in the control group. The two groups did not differ in terms of correct-related potentials (CRN), error positivity (Pe) and correct-related positivity (Pc) amplitudes. The present results indicate that individuals with schizotypal traits have deficits in error-monitoring and that reduced ERN amplitudes may represent a biological marker of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2019851582,"Wetlands are sensitive ecosystems that are increasingly subjected to threats from anthropogenic factors. In the last decades, coastal Mediterranean wetlands have been suffering considerable pressures from land use change, intensification of urban growth, increasing tourism infrastructure and intensification of agricultural practices. Remote sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques are efficient tools that can support monitoring Mediterranean coastal wetlands on large scales and over long periods of time. The study aims at developing a wetland indicator to support monitoring Mediterranean coastal wetlands using these techniques. The indicator makes use of multi-temporal Landsat images, land use reference layers, a 50m numerical model of the territory (NMT) and Corine Land Cover (CLC) for the identification and mapping of wetlands. The approach combines supervised image classification techniques making use of vegetation indices and decision tree analysis to identify the surface covered by wetlands at a given date. A validation process is put in place to compare outcomes with existing local wetland inventories to check the results reliability. The indicator´s results demonstrate an improvement in the level of precision of change detection methods achieved by traditional tools providing reliability up to 95% in main wetland areas. The results confirm that the use of RS techniques improves the precision of wetland detection compared to the use of CLC for wetland monitoring and stress the strong relation between the level of wetland detection and the nature of the wetland areas and the monitoring scale considered."
https://openalex.org/W2083530720,"The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is a protein that responds to membrane tension by opening a transient pore during osmotic downshock. Due to its large pore size and functional reconstitution into lipid membranes, MscL has been proposed as a promising artificial nanovalve suitable for biotechnological applications. For example, site-specific mutations and tailored chemical modifications have shown how MscL channel gating can be triggered in the absence of tension by introducing charged residues at the hydrophobic pore level. Recently, engineered MscL proteins responsive to stimuli like pH or light have been reported. Inspired by experiments, we present a thorough computational study aiming at describing, with atomistic detail, the artificial gating mechanism and the molecular transport properties of a light-actuated bacterial MscL channel, in which a charge-induced gating mechanism has been enabled through the selective cleavage of photo-sensitive alkylating agents. Properties such as structural transitions, pore dimension, ion flux and selectivity have been carefully analyzed. Besides, the effects of charge on alternative sites of the channel with respect to those already reported have been addressed. Overall, our results provide useful molecular insights into the structural events accompanying the engineered MscL channel gating and the interplay of electrostatic effects, channel opening and permeation properties. In addition, we describe how the experimentally observed ionic current in a single-subunit charged MscL mutant is obtained through a hydrophobicity breaking mechanism involving an asymmetric inter-subunit motion."
https://openalex.org/W2052585595,"A Yule tree is the result of a branching process with constant birth and death rates. Such a process serves as an instructive null model of many empirical systems, for instance, the evolution of species leading to a phylogenetic tree. However, often in phylogeny the only available information is the pairwise distances between a small fraction of extant species representing the leaves of the tree. In this article we study statistical properties of the pairwise distances in a Yule tree. Using a method based on a recursion, we derive an exact, analytic and compact formula for the expected number of pairs separated by a certain time distance. This number turns out to follow a increasing exponential function. This property of a Yule tree can serve as a simple test for empirical data to be well described by a Yule process. We further use this recursive method to calculate the expected number of the $n$-most closely related pairs of leaves and the number of cherries separated by a certain time distance. To make our results more useful for realistic scenarios, we explicitly take into account that the leaves of a tree may be incompletely sampled and derive a criterion for poorly sampled phylogenies. We show that our result can account for empirical data, using two families of birds species."
https://openalex.org/W1978082307,"Background Transradial approach (TRA) outweighed transfemoral approach (TFA) in acute coronary syndrome patients because the former has better short-term outcomes in high-volume percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) centers. Our study was one of the limited studies specifically in comparing the short- and medium-term effects of TRA and those of TFA in patients undergoing elective PCIs. Methods A total of 21,242 patients who underwent elective PCI with stent implantation were included. Using propensity score methodology, 1,634 patient pairs were matched. Major clinical outcomes and PCI-related complications between TRA and TFA were compared. Results In the propensity score-matched patients, the rates of in-hospital net adverse clinical events, which included death, myocardial infarction (MI), target vessel revascularization (TVR), stroke, and major bleeding, were much lower with TRA than with TFA (1.8% vs. 3.9%, P < 0.001). This difference was mainly due to the lower rate of major bleeding (0.6% vs. 1.8%, P < 0.001) and the decreased rate of MI (1.1% vs. 1.9%, P = 0.060). PCI-related dissection and thrombosis were similar between the TRA and TFA groups (both P > 0.05). Meanwhile, one-year incidence rates of major adverse cardiovascular events, which included death, MI, and TVR, were also similar (4.1% vs. 4.9%, P = 0.272) in TRA and TFA. Multivariable regression analyses showed that TRA was an independent predictor of the low rate of in-hospital net adverse clinical events (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.71), but not of major adverse cardiovascular events at one-year follow-up (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.96 to 1.06). Conclusions In patients undergoing elective PCI, TRA patients had lower rates of in-hospital net adverse clinical outcomes compared with TFA patients. TRA might be recommended as a routine approach in high-volume PCI hospitals for elective PCIs."
https://openalex.org/W2148653614,"In analogy to chemical reaction networks, I demonstrate the utility of expressing the governing equations of an arbitrary dynamical system (interaction network) as sums of real functions (generalized reactions) multiplied by real scalars (generalized stoichiometries) for analysis of its stability. The reaction stoichiometries and first derivatives define the network’s “influence topology”, a signed directed bipartite graph. Parameter reduction of the influence topology permits simplified expression of the principal minors (sums of products of non-overlapping bipartite cycles) and Hurwitz determinants (sums of products of the principal minors or the bipartite cycles directly) for assessing the network’s steady state stability. Visualization of the Hurwitz determinants over the reduced parameters defines the network’s stability phase space, delimiting the range of its dynamics (specifically, the possible numbers of unstable roots at each steady state solution). Any further explicit algebraic specification of the network will project onto this stability phase space. Stability analysis via this hierarchical approach is demonstrated on classical networks from multiple fields."
