https://openalex.org/W2472063172,"Adult mitotic tissues like the intestine, skin, and blood undergo constant turnover throughout the life of an organism. Knowing the identity of the stem cell is crucial to understanding tissue homeostasis and its aberrations upon disease. Here we present a computational method for the derivation of a lineage tree from single-cell transcriptome data. By exploiting the tree topology and the transcriptome composition, we establish StemID, an algorithm for identifying stem cells among all detectable cell types within a population. We demonstrate that StemID recovers two known adult stem cell populations, Lgr5+ cells in the small intestine and hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. We apply StemID to predict candidate multipotent cell populations in the human pancreas, a tissue with largely uncharacterized turnover dynamics. We hope that StemID will accelerate the search for novel stem cells by providing concrete markers for biological follow-up and validation."

Although antigen presentation can be mediated by autophagy, here we demonstrate a pathway for mitochondrial antigen presentation (MitAP) that relies on the generation and trafficking of mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs) rather than on autophagy/mitophagy. We find that PINK1 and Parkin, two mitochondrial proteins linked to Parkinson’s disease (PD), actively inhibit MDV formation and MitAP. In absence of PINK1 or Parkin, inflammatory conditions trigger MitAP in immune cells, both in vitro and in vivo. MitAP and the formation of MDVs require Rab9 and Sorting nexin 9, whose recruitment to mitochondria is inhibited by Parkin. The identification of PINK1 and Parkin as suppressors of an immune-response-eliciting pathway provoked by inflammation suggests new insights into PD pathology.

Antigen presentation is a complex proteolytic process enabling cells to display antigens on their surface, informing the immune system about a cell’s physiological status. These antigens allow T cells to distinguish normal cells from aberrant forms generated during diseases, including a wide range of infectious diseases and cancer (Guermonprez et al., 2002Guermonprez P. Valladeau J. Zitvogel L. Théry C. Amigorena S. Antigen presentation and T cell stimulation by dendritic cells.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 621-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). Two classical pathways of antigen presentation have been described for the presentation of endogenous proteins on MHC class I molecules, and the presentation of exogenous antigens, such as intracellular pathogens, on MHC class II molecules (Blum et al., 2013Blum J.S. Wearsch P.A. Cresswell P. Pathways of antigen processing.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 31: 443-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). While the MHC II pathway is performed by specialized cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, virtually all cell types present peptides on MHC I molecules, ensuring efficient monitoring of the organism by the immune system. It has been shown recently that autophagy, the recycling of self-components through lysosomal degradation, is involved in the presentation of endogenous antigens on both MHC class I and class II molecules (English et al., 2009English L. Chemali M. Duron J. Rondeau C. Laplante A. Gingras D. Alexander D. Leib D. Norbury C. Lippé R. Desjardins M. Autophagy enhances the presentation of endogenous viral antigens on MHC class I molecules during HSV-1 infection.Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 480-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, Paludan et al., 2005Paludan C. Schmid D. Landthaler M. Vockerodt M. Kube D. Tuschl T. Münz C. Endogenous MHC class II processing of a viral nuclear antigen after autophagy.Science. 2005; 307: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), highlighting that vacuolar content also can be presented on MHC class I molecules. In the thymus, sampling cellular antigens through autophagy plays a role in establishing immune tolerance (Nedjic et al., 2008Nedjic J. Aichinger M. Emmerich J. Mizushima N. Klein L. Autophagy in thymic epithelium shapes the T-cell repertoire and is essential for tolerance.Nature. 2008; 455: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), a process essential to limiting the occurrence of autoimmune diseases. Thus, understanding the pathways by which components from various organelles are sampled for presentation is of prime importance. In this context, little is known about the mechanisms regulating the presentation of mitochondria antigens, despite that this organelle is associated with the autoimmune disease primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) (Hirschfield and Gershwin, 2013Hirschfield G.M. Gershwin M.E. The immunobiology and pathophysiology of primary biliary cirrhosis.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2013; 8: 303-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Considering the involvement of autophagy in antigen presentation, one would assume that mitophagy, the selective process by which mitochondria are captured for degradation (Eiyama and Okamoto, 2015Eiyama A. Okamoto K. PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in mammalian cells.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2015; 33: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), would actively participate in mitochondrial antigen presentation (MitAP). Such a process would influence a disease like Parkinson’s disease (PD), since mutations in genes coding for two proteins involved in mitophagy, PINK1 and Parkin, are responsible for the early onset recessive form of PD (Hernandez et al., 2016Hernandez D.G. Reed X. Singleton A.B. Genetics in Parkinson disease: Mendelian versus non-Mendelian inheritance.J. Neurochem. 2016; (Published online April 18, 2016)https://doi.org/10.1111/jnc.13593Crossref Scopus (303) Google Scholar). PINK1 and Parkin regulate mitophagy and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced mitochondrial-derived vesicle (MDV) transport to late endosomes (McLelland et al., 2014McLelland G.L. Soubannier V. Chen C.X. McBride H.M. Fon E.A. Parkin and PINK1 function in a vesicular trafficking pathway regulating mitochondrial quality control.EMBO J. 2014; 33: 282-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, Pickrell and Youle, 2015Pickrell A.M. Youle R.J. The roles of PINK1, parkin, and mitochondrial fidelity in Parkinson’s disease.Neuron. 2015; 85: 257-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). In this context, the current model of PD proposes that defects in PINK1 and Parkin cause an accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, leading to the loss of DA neurons with age (Pickrell and Youle, 2015Pickrell A.M. Youle R.J. The roles of PINK1, parkin, and mitochondrial fidelity in Parkinson’s disease.Neuron. 2015; 85: 257-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Indeed, PINK1 is a kinase stabilized at the surface of damaged mitochondria, where it phosphorylates both ubiquitin and Parkin, promoting the recruitment of mitophagy receptors (Heo et al., 2015Heo J.M. Ordureau A. Paulo J.A. Rinehart J. Harper J.W. The PINK1-PARKIN mitochondrial ubiquitylation pathway drives a program of OPTN/NDP52 recruitment and TBK1 activation to promote mitophagy.Mol.

Youle R.J. The ubiquitin kinase PINK1 recruits autophagy receptors to induce mitophagy.Nature. 2015; 524: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). However, several observations point to a significant contribution of the immune system in the etiology of PD. These include microglial activation, an increase in the expression of inflammatory genes, local inflammation, and infiltration of immune cells in the brain of PD patients (Kannarkat et al., 2013Kannarkat G.T.

Recent studies have shown that DA neurons express MHC class I molecules at their surface in the presence of activated microglia and inflammation (Cebrián et al., 2014Cebrián C. Zucca F.A. Mauri P. Steinbeck J.A. Studer L. Scherzer C.R. Kanter E. Budhu S. Mandelbaum J. Vonsattel J.P. et al.MHC-I expression renders catecholaminergic neurons susceptible to T-cell-mediated degeneration.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 3633Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and that mice lacking MHC II are protected against MPTP-induced degeneration (Martin et al., 2016Martin H.L. Santoro M. Mustafa S. Riedel G. Forrester J.V. Teismann P. Evidence for a role of adaptive immune response in the disease pathogenesis of the MPTP mouse model of Parkinson’s disease.Glia. 2016; 64: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), providing further support for the plausibility of the contribution of immune mechanisms in the development of PD. These observations led us to investigate the role of mitophagy in antigen presentation and whether PINK1 and/or Parkin may influence this process. Here, we present in vitro and in vivo data demonstrating that PINK1 and Parkin play an active role in the repression of MitAP. In the absence of these proteins, high levels of mitochondrial antigens are presented on MHC class I molecules in both macrophages and dendritic cells by a vacuolar pathway distinct from mitophagy. Presentation of mitochondrial antigens is driven instead by the formation of mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs), a quality control mechanism allowing the shuttle of specific mitochondrial cargos to late endosomes (Sugiura et al., 2014Sugiura A. McLelland G.L. Fon E.A. McBride H.M. A new pathway for mitochondrial quality control: mitochondrial-derived vesicles.EMBO J. 2014; 33: 2142-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). We have found that both MDV formation and MitAP require Sorting nexin 9 (Snx9), a dynamin-binding partner essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Lundmark and Carlsson, 2009Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. SNX9 - a prelude to vesicle release.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The recruitment of this protein to mitochondria is actively inhibited by Parkin. Rab9, a late endosomal/Golgi guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) that regulates vesicle release from late endosomes (Kucera et al., 2015Kucera A. Distefano M.B. Berg-Larsen A. Skjeldal F. Repnik U. Bakke O. Progida C. Spatio-temporal resolution of Rab9 and CI-MPR dynamics in the endocytic pathway.Traffic. 2015; 17: 211-229Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), is also recruited to mitochondria for the formation of MDVs, while a second GTPase, Rab7, regulates the fusion of MDVs with endosomal compartments. These data identify an antigen presentation pathway regulated by PINK1 and Parkin, providing a link between mitochondrial dynamics and the potential engagement of autoimmune mechanisms in the etiology of PD. To test whether mitophagy is responsible for the presentation of mitochondrial antigens, we developed a system in which the glycoprotein B (gB) of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) is expressed in a murine macrophage cell line (RAW) and targeted to the mitochondrial matrix (mito-gB). As controls, RAW cells expressing gB targeted to either the nuclear envelope (NE-gB) or the cytoplasm (cyto-gB) (Figure 1A) were also produced. This approach allowed us to use a gB-specific CD8+ T cell hybridoma recognizing the gB498–505 peptide loaded on MHC class I molecules to monitor antigen presentation (Mueller et al., 2002Mueller S.N. Jones C.M. Smith C.M. Heath W.R. Carbone F.R. Rapid cytotoxic T lymphocyte activation occurs in the draining lymph nodes after cutaneous herpes simplex virus infection as a result of early antigen presentation and not the presence of virus.J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In steady-state conditions (37°C), the presentation of mito-gB, unlike the other two forms of gB, was dependent on vacuolar processing (Figure 1B). This is shown by the partial inhibition of mito-gB presentation in cells in which the vacuolar proton pump is inhibited with bafilomycin A (Baf) and by the increase in cells treated with a cocktail of lysosomal proteases inhibitors (PI), a condition that slows the complete degradation of proteins into amino acids within endocytic compartments (English et al., 2009English L. Chemali M. Duron J. Rondeau C. Laplante A. Gingras D. Alexander D. Leib D. Norbury C. Lippé R. Desjardins M. Autophagy enhances the presentation of endogenous viral antigens on MHC class I molecules during HSV-1 infection.Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 480-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The presentation of mito-gB also distinguished itself by being insensitive to cycloheximide treatment (Figure 1C; raw values in Figure S1A), indicating that gB localized in the mitochondria matrix is presented, rather than newly synthesized cytosolic precursor forms. To further exclude the possibility that mito-gB mistargeted to the cytoplasm is presented, we treated cells with IFNγ to stimulate the classical proteasome pathway of antigen presentation (Trost et al., 2009Trost M. English L. Lemieux S. Courcelles M. Desjardins M. Thibault P. The phagosomal proteome in interferon-gamma-activated macrophages.Immunity. 2009; 30: 143-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In these conditions, cyto-gB and NE-gB (exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear membrane) were efficiently presented (Figure 1D) in a Baf-insensitive way (Figure 1E). As expected, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 strongly inhibited presentation. In contrast, IFNγ had no effect on the presentation of mito-gB, ruling out the cytoplasm as a source of antigen. To further demonstrate that mito-gB was processed through a vacuolar pathway, we treated cells with a short, 45-min heat stress (HS), a condition known to stimulate autophagy (Nivon et al., 2009Nivon M. Richet E. Codogno P. Arrigo A.P. Kretz-Remy C. Autophagy activation by NFkappaB is essential for cell survival after heat shock.Autophagy. 2009; 5: 766-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and the vacuolar processing of endogenous proteins (Trost et al., 2009Trost M.

The phagosomal proteome in interferon-gamma-activated macrophages.Immunity. 2009; 30: 143-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In these conditions, mito-gB presentation was increased by more than 20-fold (Figure 1D; raw values in Figure S1B). Importantly, on return to 37°C, mitochondria remained fully functional with equivalent maximal respiratory rates, no increase in ROS production, or no loss in mitochondrial mass (Figures S1C–S1F). This ruled out a sustained toxic effect of the HS on mitochondria. The presentation of the two other forms of gB was also enhanced (Figure 1D) in a Baf-sensitive way (Figure 1E).Figure S1Mitochondrial Functions Are Preserved in RAW Macrophages Following Heat Shock, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Raw data showing the effect of CHX in mito-gB, mito2-gB and cyto-gB MHC-I presentation.

The data reported represent Mean ± SEM for two distinct cell cultures. All measurements were performed in triplicates. We then examined whether the presentation pathway(s) induced during HS were related to autophagy/mitophagy. We treated cells with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or downregulated the expression of ATG5 by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) (using a scramble shRNA as control), two robust methods to inhibit autophagy and mitophagy (Liu et al., 2012Liu L. Feng D. Chen G. Chen M. Zheng Q. Song P. Ma Q. Zhu C. Wang R. Qi W. et al.Mitochondrial outer-membrane protein FUNDC1 mediates hypoxia-induced mitophagy in mammalian cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, Narendra et al., 2008Narendra D. Tanaka A. Suen D.F. Youle R.J. Parkin is recruited selectively to impaired mitochondria and promotes their autophagy.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (2858) Google Scholar). Efficiency of knockdown (KD) was confirmed by qPCR (Table 1). These conditions inhibited the presentation of NE-gB and cyto-gB during HS, confirming the involvement of autophagy in their capture (Figure 2A). Remarkably, mito-gB presentation was stimulated, not inhibited, indicating that mitophagy, an ATG5-dependent pathway (Narendra et al., 2008Narendra D. Tanaka A. Suen D.F. Youle R.J. Parkin is recruited selectively to impaired mitochondria and promotes their autophagy.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (2858) Google Scholar), is not involved in MitAP, but, in fact, represses this process. To determine more precisely whether mitophagy plays a role in mito-gB presentation, we downregulated the expression of PINK1 by shRNA, a kinase required for mitophagy (Pickrell and Youle, 2015Pickrell A.M. Youle R.J. The roles of PINK1, parkin, and mitochondrial fidelity in Parkinson’s disease.Neuron. 2015; 85: 257-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). In these conditions, mito-gB presentation was strongly enhanced (Figure 2B), while the presentation of NE-gB and cyto-gB was not altered (Figure 2C). We were unable to generate Parkin KD cells, possibly due to the low level of Parkin expression in RAW cells (Figure S2A). Therefore, we performed inverse experiments and observed that a mild expression of GFP-Parkin in RAW cells abolished mito-gB presentation on HS (Figure 2D), while it had no effect on the presentation of NE-gB (data not shown). These results indicate that PINK1 and Parkin specifically regulate MitAP.Table 1Quantitative Measurement of shRNA Knockdown Efficiency by qRT-PCRAtg5Sample NameTarget NameRQRQ Min.RQ Max.Raw-mito-Scr2-IR39471.0000.8941.119Raw-mito-Atg52-IR39470.2290.7321.043Raw-cyto-Scr2-IR39471.0000.8721.146Raw-cyto-Atg52-IR39470.2090.1850.237Raw-NE-Scr2-IR39471.0000.7951.258Raw-NE-Atg52-IR39470.2230.1770.281Drp1Sample NameTarget NameRQRQ MinRQ MaxRaw-mito-ScrIR47151.0000.8601.163Raw-mito Dnm1L-4IR47150.4150.3490.492Pink1Sample NameTarget NameRQRQ MinRQ MaxRaw-mito-Scr1-IR35681.0000.7591.317Raw-mito-Pink31-IR35680.4090.3380.494Raw-cyto-scr01-IR35681.0000.9201.087Raw-cyto Pink1-301-IR35680.4910.4530.53203-Raw-NE-scr01-IR35681.0000.8511.17504-Raw-NE Pink1-301-IR35680.4070.3690.449Rab7Sample NameTarget NameRQRQ MinRQ MaxRaw-NE-ScrIR48741.0000.8821.134Raw-full-Rab7-4IR48740.3960.3410.459Snx9Sample NameTarget NameRQRQ MinRQ MaxRaw-mito-ScrIR45851.0000.8051.242Raw-mito_Snx9-3IR45850.5390.4670.623Raw-NE-ScrIR45851.0000.9031.107Raw-NE-Snx-9-3IR45850.3340.2940.379 Open table in a new tab Figure S2Mitophagy Is Not Responsible for MitAP, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Western blot shows low Parkin expression level in RAW cells compared to HEK and COS7 cells, while the expression in HELA is also low.

(C) IF shows LC3-GFP increase in expression and recruitment to mitochondria after CCCP treatment. Additional experiments ruled out the contribution of mitophagy in mito-gB presentation. We showed that mito-gB presentation was unaffected in cells silenced for the GTPase dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1) (Figure 2E), a protein required for mitochondria fragmentation and mitophagy (Narendra et al., 2008Narendra D. Tanaka A. Suen D.F. Youle R.J. Parkin is recruited selectively to impaired mitochondria and promotes their autophagy.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (2858) Google Scholar). Efficiency of the Drp1 KD was confirmed by showing that mitochondria could no longer be fragmented by protonophore m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) treatment (Figure S2B). Furthermore, treatment with CCCP to maximally activate mitophagy had no effect on mito-gB presentation (Figure 2F). Efficiency of the treatment was confirmed through the induction of LC3 expression and degradation of mitofusin1 (Figures 2G and S2C). Similar results were obtained in RAW cells expressing GFP-Parkin (data not shown). These data demonstrate that mitophagy provides an efficient pathway for the capture and degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria in a way that limits antigen presentation. In that respect, mitophagy differs from autophagic pathways, such as macroautophagy (Paludan et al., 2005Paludan C. Schmid D. Landthaler M. Vockerodt M. Kube D. Tuschl T. Münz C. Endogenous MHC class II processing of a viral nuclear antigen after autophagy.Science. 2005; 307: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) and NEDA (English et al., 2009English L. Chemali M. Duron J. Rondeau C. Laplante A. Gingras D. Alexander D. Leib D. Norbury C. Lippé R. Desjardins M. Autophagy enhances the presentation of endogenous viral antigens on MHC class I molecules during HSV-1 infection.Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 480-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). This might be due to the fact that mitochondria are of bacterial origin. Because the immune system is able to recognize and mount an efficient response against bacteria phylogenetically related to mitochondria, it might be beneficial to limit the exposure of mitochondrial antigens to the immune system (Baum, 1995Baum H. Mitochondrial antigens, molecular mimicry and autoimmune disease.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Having shown that mitophagy is not involved in MitAP, we performed experiments to determine the nature of the Baf-sensitive pathway responsible for mito-gB presentation during HS. We showed previously that selective delivery of mitochondrial content to late endosomes occurs through mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs) (Soubannier et al., 2012Soubannier V. McLelland G.L. Zunino R. Braschi E. Rippstein P. Fon E.A. McBride H.M. A vesicular transport pathway shuttles cargo from mitochondria to lysosomes.Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: 135-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). MDVs differ from mitochondrial fragments through at least three distinct criteria: (1) only selected cargo is incorporated within vesicles, (2) they are formed in a Drp1-independent manner, and (3) ultrastructural analysis reveals a limited diameter of 80–150 nm containing a single outer membrane or a double membrane-bound structure that lack cristae (Sugiura et al., 2014Sugiura A. McLelland G.L. Fon E.A. McBride H.M. A new pathway for mitochondrial quality control: mitochondrial-derived vesicles.EMBO J. 2014; 33: 2142-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). With these criteria in mind, we examined whether a PINK1/Parkin-independent MDV pathway may be responsible for the induction of MitAP observed during HS. Immunofluorescence analyses (IF) indicated that the colocalized signals for mito-gB and the mitochondrial marker Tom20 dissociated on HS, mito-gB being observed in small vesicular-like structures lacking Tom20 throughout the cell (Figure 3A). To test whether these structures reflected membrane-bound vesicles, we performed biochemical fractionation. In control cells kept at 37°C, gB and Tom20 co-fractionated in the denser parts of a sucrose gradient (Figure 3B). As observed by IF, HS induced the dissociation of both markers, shifting a significant part of gB to lower density fractions. HSP60, a second matrix protein, was not shifted to light fractions on HS, supporting the concept that cargo-selective mechanisms operate during MDV formation. Consistent with mito-gB being a MDV cargo, in HS-treated cells, gB was pelleted at 110,000 × g from a post-mitochondrial supernatant and was soluble in the presence of detergent (Figure 3C). Confocal images at higher magnification revealed the lateral segregation of gB along mitochondrial tubules stained for Tom20, consistent with the selective enrichment of gB into vesicular structures (Figure 3D). Electron microscopy (EM) showed the emergence of small, double membrane-bound vesicular profiles (between 80–120 nm in diameter) from mitochondria in HS conditions, while these structures were not observed in our samples at 37°C (Figure 3D). These experiments are consistent with mito-gB being a matrix cargo, selectively incorporated within vesicular structures derived from mitochondria in a Drp1-independent manner on HS treatment. Lastly, mito-gB+/Tom20− MDVs were observed close to LAMP1+ compartments on HS (Figure 3E), suggesting that they might be involved in the trafficking of gB to degradative organelles for antigen processing. Since the processing of mito-gB was vacuolar, we assumed that MDVs interacted with late endosomes/lysosomes. This led us to study the potential involv"

The successful evolution of a non-native carbon fixation pathway, though not yet resulting in net carbon gain, strikingly demonstrates the capacity for rapid trophic-mode evolution of metabolism applicable to biotechnology. Whether CO2 can or cannot be transformed into sugar and biomass by carbon fixation is arguably the most basic distinction we make in defining the metabolism of an organism. Carbon fixation by autotrophs is the biochemical gateway to the organic world, as obligate heterotrophs are dependent on this supply of organic carbon. How difficult is it to evolve from one trophic mode of growth to another? Specifically, can the ability to synthesize biomass from CO2 be introduced into a heterotrophic organism? Exploring the process in which a heterotrophic bacterium, such as Escherichia coli, is evolved to synthesize sugars from CO2 can serve as a model system to tackle these questions. The utilization of one-carbon compounds, such as CO2, methanol, and methane, has been recently drawing attention as a low-cost, abundant feedstock option for biochemical production (Li et al., 2012Li H.

Recent studies have demonstrated that a wide variety of non-native metabolic pathways can be integrated into model microorganisms, allowing the synthesis of value-added chemicals using sugar as a feedstock (Galanie et al., 2015Galanie S.

However, efforts to synthesize sugar from inorganic CO2 by introducing a non-native carbon fixation cycle have never been successful. Carbohydrate biosynthesis through carbon fixation in E. coli would not only open exciting avenues to directly utilize CO2 for chemical production, but could also serve as a platform to rapidly optimize carbon fixation enzymes and pathways for subsequent implementation in agricultural crops (Lin et al., 2014Lin M.T.

Furthermore, this experimental approach could shed light on cellular adaptations associated with horizontal-gene-transfer events, on the plasticity of metabolic networks, and on the evolutionary emergence of a biological novelty. The achievement of novel biological phenotypes on laboratory timescales is at the heart of efforts such as the long-term evolutionary experiment, which studied how E. coli developed the ability to utilize citrate throughout several tens of thousands of generations (Blount et al., 2008Blount Z.D.

In parallel to lab evolution, which forces the selective conditions, synthetic biology efforts manipulate the genetic makeup with the aim of rationally designing desired phenotypes (Church et al., 2014Church G.M.

In spite of significant progress, nothing as extreme as expressing a fully functional pathway that changes the trophic mode of an organism has been ever shown to be achievable. The Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle (Bassham et al., 1954Bassham J.A. Benson A.A. Kay L.D. Harris A.Z. Wilson A.T. Calvin M. The path of carbon in photosynthesis. XXI.

Previous efforts to show functional expression of the CBB cycle carboxylating enzyme, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), in E. coli have relied on the supply of a glycolytic carbon source (e.g., glucose) to replenish RuBisCO’s substrate, ribulose-bisphosphate (RuBP) (Durão et al., 2015Durão P.

These important studies therefore did not achieve the defining function of the CBB cycle of autocatalytic sugar synthesis from inorganic carbon. While this approach led to the elegant construction of a RuBisCO-dependent E. coli as a platform for directed evolution of RuBisCO activity (Durão et al., 2015Durão P. Aigner H. Nagy P.

Sel. 2006; 19: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), evolving a complete carbon fixation cycle capable of autocatalytically generating biomass from CO2 has remained an open challenge. Here, we report achieving a fully functional and autocatalytic carbon fixation cycle in E. coli, capable of hexose, pentose and triose sugar synthesis with no input of organic carbon into the cycle. Energy and reducing power are supplied by the oxidation of an organic acid (pyruvate) in an isolated metabolic module and thus no net carbon gain is achieved at this point. This is the first example of a non-native carbon assimilation cycle in which all of the pathway intermediates and products are solely synthesized from CO2 and the required co-factors. Out of the dozen of reactions utilized by autotrophs in the CBB cycle for the biosynthesis of sugars from CO2, only two enzymatic activities are absent in E. coli: phosphoribulokinase (prk) and RuBisCO. The native enzymes of gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathway in E. coli can catalyze all other reactions (Figure S1). Therefore, heterologous expression of RuBisCO and prk could, in principle, equip E. coli with the enzymatic machinery needed to execute all CBB cycle reactions and achieve the synthesis of sugar, as well as other major biomass constituents, from CO2. Inspired by the powerful tool of genetic screens, in which genomic perturbations and controlled growth conditions are combined to identify new phenotypes, we have used a computational framework based on flux balance analysis to analyze hundreds of gene-deletion combinations and identify perturbations in central carbon metabolism that, together with RuBisCO and prk expression, couple the rate of carbon fixation to cellular fitness (Figures S2 and S3; Experimental Procedures). Our analysis pointed to a yet unexplored scenario in which targeted severing of gluconeogenesis would decouple energy harvesting and biomass production into two independent metabolic networks (Figure 1). This rewired metabolism could drive the synthesis of sugars and other essential biomass components from CO2 as the sole carbon source, while production of cellular energy would be obtained from the catabolism of an organic carbon in the energy module. This scenario goes beyond previously described RuBisCO-dependent strains (Gong et al., 2015Gong F. Liu G. Zhai X. Zhou J. Cai Z. Li Y.

We termed this mode of growth, not known to occur in nature, hemiautotrophic growth (i.e., half-autotrophic, as it cuts metabolism into two parts, only one of which is autotrophic) and aimed to explore it in the lab. Our design for decoupling energy harvesting and CO2 fixation does not result in a net gain of carbon when energy is obtained from the oxidation of an organic carbon source (e.g., pyruvate). However, it creates a malleable platform to test the functionality of synthetic carbon fixation pathways and offers powerful modularity in the choice of energy module for carbon fixation.Figure S3Systematic Approach for Identifying Metabolic Configurations in Which Carbon Fixation Activity Is Essential for Cell Growth, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Each block (see 3x3 yellow grid, top left) refers to a combination of two knockouts in metabolic reactions within central carbon metabolism of E. coli (knockout genes marked on axes). We computationally analyzed the coupling of growth (biomass formation) to RuBisCO target flux in each combination of reaction knockouts for nine different carbon sources (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The coupling between target flux and biomass production is shown using a color code. Feasible fluxes are calculated for the perturbed metabolic network (Figure S2; Supplemental Experimental Procedures) when grown on each of the nine carbon sources as inputs (in addition to CO2). Metabolic configurations (a specific combination of knockout mutations and carbon source) in which carbon fixation activity is essential for cell growth are highlighted in shades of green. The coupling slope is defined as the minimal carbon fixation flux, required per unit of biomass produced. Gray cells refer to configurations in which carbon fixation is not essential for growth, while black cells are configurations where growth is not possible.(B) The flux requirements for biomass formation of four metabolic configurations. A mutant strain which lacks the enzymatic activities of phosphofructokinase (pfkA and pfkB, denoted for simplicity as Δpfk) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Δzwf) is predicted to grow on pyruvate even without RuBisCO flux, and it thus contains points along the x axis and is colored gray. In contrast, the same set of knockouts when using pentoses (e.g., xylose) requires flux through RuBisCO (and prk). This result stems from the stoichiometry of the pentose phosphate pathway which converts three pentose sugars into two molecules of fructose-6-P (F6P) and a glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate triose. Downstream glycolysis of F6P requires pfk activity to generate fructose-1,6-P and feed the glycolytic pathway. Therefore, pfk deficient mutant is predicted not to grow on pentose sugars as a single carbon source without carbon fixation. Recombinant expression of RuBisCO and prk creates a pfk independent route from pentoses to trioses through the RuBisCO-dependent carboxylation of RuBP to 3-phosphoglycerate, hence rescuing growth. In contrast to pentose metabolism, three-carbon inputs to glycolysis (e.g., pyruvate) do not require pfk activity for catabolism, nor for the gluconeogenic biosynthesis of hexose phosphates which takes place via fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (fbp). An interesting scenario is the combined knockout of zwf and phosphoglycerate mutase (gpmA and gpmM, denoted for simplicity as Δgpm). In this strain, expression of CBB enzymes allows growth on carbon sources which enter central carbon metabolism through lower glycolysis (e.g., pyruvate, bottom left). The metabolic cutoff prevents gluconeogenic carbon flow and therefore sugar synthesis from the organic carbon source. Since sugars (e.g., glucose-6-phosphate, ribose-5-phosphate) are essential components for biomass synthesis, heterotrophic growth is not feasible. However, pyruvate can be readily metabolized in the TCA cycle to generate ATP and reducing power, hence supplying the energy to allow carbon fixation using a non-native CBB cycle. We term such growth hemiautotrophic. The RuBisCO-dependent assimilation of CO2 into biomass, supplies the demand for biomass precursors, such as sugars, which cannot be synthesized from organic carbon in this Δgpm Δzwf strain. Uptake rate was set to 10 mmol gCDW-1 h-1 for xylose, and 16.7 for pyruvate.(C) The RuBisCO dependency of a Δpfk Δzwf strain was experimentally validated. Gene deletions were performed using iterative P1 transductions (Supplemental Methods) and growth was tested on permissive (i.e., glycerol or pyruvate) versus restrictive carbon sources (i.e., xylose) under elevated CO2 conditions (pCO2 = 0.1 atm). As predicted from the stoichiometric model, growth on xylose was observed only in pCBB transformants, expressing RuBisCO and prk.(D) E. coli BW25133, with an unperturbed metabolic network, can grow heterotrophically on minimal media supplied with a single carbon source. In contrast, a metabolically perturbed Δgpm Δzwf strain requires a minimum of two carbon sources for heterotrophic growth, each feeding into one of the two disconnected sub networks formed by the metabolic cutoff. When two carbon sources are co-supplied (e.g., xylose and pyruvate), lack of either one would limit growth, even in excess of the other. As the experimental results show, per given concentration of supplied pyruvate (feeding the energy module), maximal biomass formation is initially proportional to the amount of supplied xylose. An excess of xylose beyond the point in which the ratio of carbon sources matches the consumption uptake ratio, does not contribute to the formation of additional biomass since growth becomes limited by the availability of pyruvate. Knowledge of these different domains can be used to ensure a feeding ratio in the chemostat that will ensure xylose limited conditions with excess pyruvate ready to be used for making energy for carbon fixation. In a hemiautotrophic growth mode (in the presence of a fully functional CBB cycle), growth can be obtained using only pyruvate and CO2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1Decoupling Energy Production and Carbon Fixation in E. coli to Achieve Hemiautotrophic GrowthShow full captionTwo recombinant enzymes are needed to complete a carbon fixation cycle in E. coli: RuBisCO, the carboxylating enzyme, and the kinase prk. The remaining reactions required for the reduction and substrate regeneration phases of the cycle are endogenous to the metabolic network of the host, as part of gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Deletion of the phosphoglycerate mutase genes (ΔgpmA and ΔgpmM) disrupts carbon flow in the glycolytic/gluconeogenic backbone and generates two disconnected sub-networks: (1) a carbon fixation module containing upper glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the two foreign CBB enzymes and (2) an energy module, containing lower glycolysis and the TCA cycle, supplying reducing power and ATP. In a scenario in which an organic carbon source (e.g., pyruvate) is utilized by the energy module to supply the energetic demands of the carbon fixation cycle, the cellular building blocks derived from carbon fixation module metabolites (e.g., phospho sugars, such as ribose-P; see Figure S4 for details) can be synthesized from inorganic carbon using the non-native CBB cycle. The remainder of the biomass building blocks (those emanating from the energy module metabolites, e.g., organic acids for many of the amino acids), as well as the energy requirements of the cell, are supplied directly via the catabolism of the organic carbon source. In such a hemiautotrophic growth mode, CO2 and energy carriers are the sole inputs for the production of biomass precursors in a carbon fixation cycle.See also Figures S1, S2, S3, and S4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Each block (see 3x3 yellow grid, top left) refers to a combination of two knockouts in metabolic reactions within central carbon metabolism of E. coli (knockout genes marked on axes).

https://openalex.org/W2473954287,"Longevity-promoting caloric restriction is thought to trigger downregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and upregulation of SIRT1 activity with associated health benefits. Here, we show that mTORC1 signaling in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) is instead upregulated during calorie restriction (CR). SIRT1 deacetylates S6K1, thereby enhancing its phosphorylation by mTORC1, which leads to an increase in protein synthesis and an increase in ISC number. Paneth cells in the ISC niche secrete cyclic ADP ribose that triggers SIRT1 activity and mTORC1 signaling in neighboring ISCs. Notably, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, previously reported to mimic effects of CR, abolishes this expansion of ISCs. We suggest that Paneth cell signaling overrides any direct nutrient sensing in ISCs to sculpt the observed response to CR. Moreover, drugs that modulate pathways important in CR may exert opposing effects on different cell types."

Such data are necessary to compare the resources provided by alternative meadow seed mixes to each other and to other flowering habitats. We used quantitative surveys of over 2 million flowers to estimate the nectar and pollen resources offered by two exemplar commercial seed mixes (one annual, one perennial) and associated weeds grown as 300m2 meadows across four UK cities, sampled at six time points between May and September 2013. Nectar sugar and pollen rewards per flower varied widely across 65 species surveyed, with native British weed species (including dandelion, Taraxacum agg.) contributing the top five nectar producers and two of the top ten pollen producers. Seed mix species yielding the highest rewards per flower included Leontodon hispidus, Centaurea cyanus and C. nigra for nectar, and Papaver rhoeas, Eschscholzia californica and Malva moschata for pollen. Perennial meadows produced up to 20x more nectar and up to 6x more pollen than annual meadows, which in turn produced far more than amenity grassland controls. Perennial meadows produced resources earlier in the year than annual meadows, but both seed mixes delivered very low resource levels early in the year and these were provided almost entirely by native weeds. Pollen volume per flower is well predicted statistically by floral morphology, and nectar sugar mass and pollen volume per unit area are correlated with flower counts, raising the possibility that resource levels can be estimated for species or habitats where they cannot be measured directly. Our approach does not incorporate resource quality information (for example, pollen protein or essential amino acid content), but can easily do so when suitable data exist. Our approach should inform the design of new seed mixes to ensure continuity in floral resource availability throughout the year, and to identify suitable species to fill resource gaps in established mixes."
https://openalex.org/W2461221680,"Acquired resistance to chemotherapy remains a major stumbling block in cancer treatment. Chronic inflammation has a crucial role in induction of chemoresistance and results, in part, from the induction and expansion of inflammatory cells that include myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and IL-13+ Th2 cells. The mechanisms that lead to induction of activated MDSCs and IL-13+ Th2 cells have not yet been identified. Here we demonstrated that doxorubicin (DOX) treatment of 4T1 breast tumor-bearing mice led to the induction of IL-13R+miR-126a+ MDSCs (DOX-MDSC). DOX-MDSC promote breast tumor lung metastasis through MDSC miR-126a+ exosomal-mediated induction of IL-13+ Th2 cells and tumor angiogenesis. The induction of DOX-MDSC is regulated in a paracrine manner. DOX treatment not only increases interleukin (IL)-33 released from breast tumor cells, which is crucial for the induction of IL-13+ Th2 cells, but it also participates in the induction of IL-13 receptors and miR-126a expressed on/in the MDSCs. IL-13 released from IL-13+Th2 cells then promotes the production of DOX-MDSC and MDSC miR-126a+ exosomes via MDSC IL-13R. MDSC miR-126a+ exosomes further induce IL13+ Th2 cells in a positive feed-back loop manner. We also showed that MDSC miR-126a rescues DOX-induced MDSC death in a S100A8/A9-dependent manner and promotes tumor angiogenesis. Our findings provide insight into the MDSC exosomal-mediated chemoresistance mechanism, which will be useful for the design of inhibitors targeting the blocking of induction of miR-126a+ MDSCs."

The identification of this infant bnAb illustrates that HIV-1-specific neutralization breadth can develop without prolonged affinity maturation and extensive SHM. HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are thought to be an important component of a protective HIV-1 vaccine but eliciting such responses remains elusive. Indeed, broad and potent neutralizing antibody responses are relatively rare even in HIV-infected individuals and typically take several years to develop, at least in adults where they have been most extensively studied (Mouquet, 2014Mouquet H. Antibody B cell responses in HIV-1 infection.Trends Immunol. 2014; 35: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). There have now been several detailed studies of adults who develop broad neutralizing antibody responses, with the goal of trying to reproduce this process with a vaccine, and a number of bnAbs have been isolated from chronic infection (Mascola and Haynes, 2013Mascola J.R.

Two recent studies showed these bnAbs can bind to virus that was transmitted, suggesting that an interaction with the infecting virus may have stimulated the germline B cell receptors (BCRs) to initiate development of the bnAb lineage (Doria-Rose et al., 2014Doria-Rose N.A.

Adult-derived bnAbs exhibit features reflective of long-term affinity maturation including high levels of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and rare insertions and deletions (indels) (Klein et al., 2013bKlein F.

The unusual features of these bnAbs may be the result of a process of iterative rounds of affinity maturation in response to viral escape over years of infection before developing neutralization breadth (Klein et al., 2013bKlein F. Mouquet H. Dosenovic P. Scheid J.F. Scharf L. Nussenzweig M.C. Antibodies in HIV-1 vaccine development and therapy.Science. 2013; 341: 1199-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, West et al., 2014West Jr., A.P. Scharf L. Scheid J.F. Klein F.

While studies are underway to develop strategies to mimic this long-term process and guide affinity maturation (Doria-Rose and Joyce, 2015Doria-Rose N.A. Joyce M.G. Strategies to guide the antibody affinity maturation process.Curr. Opin. Virol. 2015; 11: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), this will undoubtedly be a challenging task. HIV-1-infected infants were recently shown to produce plasma antibody responses that potently neutralize a diverse panel of HIV-1 isolates including more difficult to neutralize variants from across clades and these responses developed as early as 1–2 years post-infection (pi) (Goo et al., 2014Goo L. Chohan V. Nduati R. Overbaugh J. Early development of broadly neutralizing antibodies in HIV-1-infected infants.Nat. Med. 2014; 20: 655-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). While adult HIV-1 bnAbs have been extensively characterized, nothing is known about infant bnAbs contributing to broad plasma responses. The relatively rapid development of infant plasma neutralization breadth may suggest that the bnAbs responsible for breadth have distinct features relative to adult HIV-1-specific bnAbs, including lower SHM. Furthermore, whether infant bnAbs target similar or novel epitopes on HIV-1 envelope (Env) compared to adult bnAbs is not known. To better understand the early development of bnAbs in natural infection, we isolated and characterized infant HIV-1-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies contributing to plasma breadth within the first year of infection. Infant BF520 was HIV RNA- and DNA-negative at 8 days of age then subsequently detected positive at 114 days (3.8 months) of age, suggesting transmission likely occurred via breastfeeding. Plasma from this HIV-1 clade A infected infant demonstrated cross-clade tier 2 neutralizing activity by as early as 12 months of age (Goo et al., 2014Goo L. Chohan V. Nduati R. Overbaugh J. Early development of broadly neutralizing antibodies in HIV-1-infected infants.Nat. Med. 2014; 20: 655-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). IgG+ memory B cells from 15 months of age, 11.2 months pi, were isolated and cultured. B cell culture supernatants were tested for neutralizing activity using a tier 1 clade B virus (SF162) and a tier 2 clade C virus (QC406.F3). These viruses were potently neutralized by BF520 plasma from the contemporaneous time point (IC50 > 3,200 and 922, respectively) (Goo et al., 2014Goo L. Chohan V. Nduati R. Overbaugh J. Early development of broadly neutralizing antibodies in HIV-1-infected infants.Nat. Med. 2014; 20: 655-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Ten antibodies with HIV-specific neutralizing activity were isolated and tested for neutralization against the cross-clade virus panel originally used to define the breadth of the infant plasma nAb response (Figure 1) (Goo et al., 2014Goo L. Chohan V. Nduati R. Overbaugh J. Early development of broadly neutralizing antibodies in HIV-1-infected infants.Nat. Med. 2014; 20: 655-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). All isolated antibodies neutralized SF162; eight also neutralized either clade A heterologous tier 1 variant Q461.d1 or another clade A heterologous tier 2 virus Q842.d16 or both, indicating modest heterologous breadth specific to the clade of the infecting virus. One infant antibody, BF520.1, neutralized tier 2 variants from clades A, B, and C and one tier 3 variant from clade B. Interestingly, this cross-clade bnAb did not neutralize some clade A variants that were neutralized by other isolated antibodies. Plasma neutralized eight viruses that were not neutralized by the isolated neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). However, plasma neutralization potency was low (IC50 < 200) for these eight viruses, suggesting the antibodies that drive this neutralization may be less potent and thus hard to identify with the functional screening approach used here. Thus, while antibody BF520.1 accounts for much of the plasma neutralization activity, the other nine nAbs we identified as well as additional unidentified antibodies contribute to overall breadth observed with BF520 plasma. To compare the neutralizing activity of BF520.1 to adult bnAbs, we tested for neutralization of a global panel of viruses designed for standardized assessments of nAbs (Figure 2) (deCamp et al., 2014deCamp A. Hraber P. Bailer R.T. Seaman M.S. Ochsenbauer C. Kappes J. Gottardo R. Edlefsen P. Self S. Tang H. et al.Global panel of HIV-1 Env reference strains for standardized assessments of vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies.J. Virol. 2014; 88: 2489-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). BF520 plasma from 15 months of age neutralized 10/12 of the virus panel. BF520.1 neutralized 7/10 viruses neutralized by the corresponding plasma. Only one of the other nine nAbs neutralized a virus from this panel (virus 398F1, nAb BF520.4; IC50 = 14 μg ml−1). We compared BF520.1 to first-generation adult bnAbs, which have moderate breadth and potency, and a selection of broad and potent second-generation adult bnAbs (Falkowska et al., 2014Falkowska E. Le K.M. Ramos A. Doores K.J. Lee J.H. Blattner C. Ramirez A. Derking R. van Gils M.J.

The neutralization breadth of BF520.1 (58%; Figure 2) is greater than that of the first-generation adult bnAbs, which range from 8%–50%, and falls within the range for the second-generation adult bnAbs (42%–100%). BF520.1 also demonstrates greater neutralization potency (geometric mean IC50 for viruses neutralized = 1.95 μg ml−1; Figure 2) compared to first-generation adult bnAbs (2.4–10.3 μg ml−1) and has comparable potency to the CD4 binding site directed bnAb VRC01 (2.13 μg ml−1) (Wu et al., 2010Wu X.

Xu L. et al.Rational design of envelope identifies broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies to HIV-1.Science. 2010; 329: 856-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar), which is actively being pursued in rational vaccine design and tested for efficacy in human trials (Jardine et al., 2015Jardine J.G.

Med. 2015; 7: 319ra206Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Overall, these data from the global reference panel show that the infant bnAb BF520.1 demonstrates generally similar neutralization breadth to many adult bnAbs but with lower potency. The infant cross-clade bnAb BF520.1 exhibited a similar neutralization profile to the PGT-class of bnAbs (Goo et al., 2012aGoo L. Jalalian-Lechak Z. Richardson B.A. Overbaugh J. A combination of broadly neutralizing HIV-1 monoclonal antibodies targeting distinct epitopes effectively neutralizes variants found in early infection.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 10857-10861Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which target the N332 glycan in V3 (Walker et al., 2011Walker L.M. Huber M. Doores K.J. Falkowska E. Pejchal R. Julien J.P. Wang S.K. Ramos A. Chan-Hui P.Y. Moyle M. et al.Protocol G Principal InvestigatorsBroad neutralization coverage of HIV by multiple highly potent antibodies.Nature. 2011; 477: 466-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effect of N332 on BF520.1 neutralization (Figures 3A and 3B ). Neutralization was disrupted by removal of the N332 glycan for two viruses tested (93- and 5-fold increase IC50), similar to what was observed for a prototype N332-directed bnAb, PGT128 (32- and 17-fold increase IC50). Adding the N332 glycan to an infant clade A heterologous virus BG505.W6.C2 (Wu et al., 2006Wu X. Parast A.B. Richardson B.A. Nduati R. John-Stewart G. Mbori-Ngacha D. Rainwater S.M. Overbaugh J.

Virol. 2006; 80: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) resulted in increased neutralization sensitivity (17-fold decrease IC50). These data indicate that this infant antibody targets a similar site on Env as the N332-dependent adult nAbs such as 2G12 and the PGT class of adult bnAbs (Kong et al., 2013Kong L. Lee J.H.

BF520.1 and PGT128 appear to dock to the trimer at the base of V3 with an overlapping footprint and to be oriented relative to the trimer with a similar angle of approach (Lee et al., 2015Lee J.H. de Val N.

The BF520.1 Fab, however, is slightly twisted and docked more closely to the gp120 core than PGT128 (Figure S1). At the resolution of the negative-stain reconstruction we are not able to infer the role of the complementarity determining region (CDR) loops or the specific residues on the paratope or epitope that are involved in this interaction. Thus, while our mutagenesis data implicates the glycan at N332 is an important component of the epitope for BF520.1, additional studies are needed to more directly compare the BF520.1 epitope and paratope to those of other antibodies that target the N332 supersite.Figure S1EM of BF520.1 Fab Complexed with BG505.W6.C2.T332N SOSIP, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Negative-stain image of BG505.W6.C2.T332N SOSIP:BF520.1-Fab complex (scale bar = 20 nm).(B) Reference free 2D class averages showing both top and side views of BG505 SOSIP:BF520.1-Fab complex. 2D classification was not used for 3D refinement but is shown for visual purposes.(C) Fourier-shell correlation (FSC) curve for the BF520.1-BG505 SOSIP trimer negative-stain EM reconstruction obtained by ‘gold standard’ refinement in EMAN2.1.(D) Surface rendering of BG505 SOSIP:BF520.1-Fab negative-stain EM map, lowpass-filtered to 20 Å, compared with BG505 SOSIP:PGT128 Cryo-EM map (cyan; emd_3121), also low-pass filtered to 20 Å.

To gain insight into the development of the isolated infant antibodies, we examined whether the infant nAbs bind and/or neutralize autologous Env variants isolated at first HIV detection (3.8 months/14 weeks of age, designated “W14”). The diversity among these Env variants was low (maximum pairwise distance = 0.0067; Figure S2). Surprisingly, all 10 nAbs failed to neutralize the 11 early-stage, transmitted variants, despite potent neutralization by contemporaneous plasma (Figure S3), suggesting our functional screen for heterologous neutralization did not capture the nAbs mediating autologous neutralization by plasma from the 15-month time point. Despite the lack of neutralization of the earliest isolated variants, BF520.1 and the other nine infant nAbs bound to the corresponding autologous BF520.W14 cell-surface Env variants (Figure 4). Each of the ten infant nAbs also bound SF162, which they all neutralized, with BF520.1 exhibiting the highest level of binding, comparable to that of VRC01 (Figure 4).Figure S3BF520 Autologous Neutralization, Related to Figures 5 and 6Show full captionBF520 autologous neutralization.

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a known regulator of immune responses, but the role that mTORC1 signaling plays in poststroke neuroinflammation is not clear. To explore the relationship between microglial action in the mTORC1 pathway and the impact on stroke, we administered the mTORC1 inhibitors sirolimus and everolimus to mice. Presumably, disrupting the mTORC1 pathway after focal ischemic stroke should clarify the subsequent activity of microglia. For that purpose, we generated mice deficient in the regulatory associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) in microglia, whose mTORC1 signaling was blocked, by crossing Raptor loxed (Raptorflox/flox) mice with CX3CR1CreER mice, which express Cre recombinase under the control of the CX3C chemokine receptor 1 promoter. mTORC1 blockade reduced lesion size, improved motor function, dramatically decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and reduced the number of M1 type microglia. Thus, mTORC1 blockade apparently attenuated behavioral deficits and poststroke inflammation after middle cerebral artery occlusion by preventing microglia polarization toward the M1 type.—Li, D., Wang, C., Yao, Y., Chen, L., Liu, G., Zhang, R., Liu, Q., Shi, F.-D., Hao, J. mTORC1 pathway disruption ameliorates brain inflammation following stroke via a shift in microglia phenotype from M1 type to M2 type.

Although PCs are well characterized on many levels, surprisingly little is known about their axon collaterals and their target neurons within the cerebellar cortex. It has been proposed that PC collaterals transiently control circuit assembly in early development, but it is thought that PC-to-PC connections are subsequently pruned. Here, we find that all PCs have collaterals in young, juvenile, and adult mice. Collaterals are restricted to the parasagittal plane, and most synapses are located in close proximity to PCs. Using optogenetics and electrophysiology, we find that in juveniles and adults, PCs make synapses onto other PCs, molecular layer interneurons, and Lugaro cells, but not onto Golgi cells. These findings establish that PC output can feed back and regulate numerous circuit elements within the cerebellar cortex and is well suited to contribute to processing in parasagittal zones."

Our network model, inferred using machine learning, linked stress-induced behavioral pathology to the capacity of PFC to synchronize amygdala and VTA activity. Direct stimulation of PFC-amygdala circuitry with DREADDs normalized PFC-dependent limbic synchrony in stress-susceptible animals and restored normal behavior. In addition to providing insights into MDD mechanisms, our findings demonstrate an interdisciplinary approach that can be used to identify the large-scale network changes that underlie complex emotional pathologies and the specific network nodes that can be used to develop targeted interventions."

We used two-photon calcium imaging in anesthetized and awake mice to visualize both odorant-evoked excitation and suppression in OB output neurons (mitral and tufted, MT cells). MT cell response polarity mapped uniformly to discrete OB glomeruli, allowing us to analyze how inhibition shapes OB output relative to the glomerular map. Odorants elicited unique patterns of suppression in only a subset of glomeruli in which such suppression could be detected, and excited and suppressed glomeruli were spatially intermingled. Binary mixture experiments revealed that interglomerular inhibition could suppress excitatory mitral cell responses to odorants. These results reveal that inhibitory OB circuits nonlinearly transform odor representations and support a model of selective and nonrandom inhibition among glomerular ensembles."

Our studies have therefore uncovered a p38α-mediated pathway that alters HSPC metabolism to respond to stress and promote recovery. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) maintain the hematopoietic system for an organism’s entire lifetime under homeostatic or in stress settings (Orkin and Zon, 2008Orkin S.H. Zon L.I. Hematopoiesis: an evolving paradigm for stem cell biology.Cell. 2008; 132: 631-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). At steady state, long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs), the most undifferentiated cells in the hematological system, are kept quiescent or in G0 of the cell cycle (Orkin and Zon, 2008Orkin S.H. Zon L.I. Hematopoiesis: an evolving paradigm for stem cell biology.Cell. 2008; 132: 631-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). Hematological stress, such as radiation, anti-cancer medication, and infection, depletes the body of blood cells, and if stress remains below the lethal dose, bone marrow (BM) LT-HSCs enter the cell cycle and robustly repopulate the entire hematopoietic system via multi-lineage differentiation and self-renewal (Blanpain et al., 2011Blanpain C. Mohrin M. Sotiropoulou P.A. Passegué E. DNA-damage response in tissue-specific and cancer stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 16-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Such hematological repopulation activity is termed “stress hematopoiesis,” an activity essential for homeostatic maintenance of blood production. This activity also occurs following bone marrow transplantation (BMT): transplanted donor LT-HSCs exit G0, begin proliferating, and repopulate the entire population of blood cells in the recipient. Understanding stress hematopoiesis is also critical to establish efficient methods enabling expansion in vitro of HSPCs, since forced activation of the cell cycle by cytokine supplementation induces a stress-like cellular state. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying stress hematopoiesis by LT-HSCs remain elusive. The activity or expression of various enzymes is upregulated by extrinsic stimuli that govern stress responses. Among those enzymes is p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), a member of the MAPK superfamily (Arthur and Ley, 2013Arthur J.S. Ley S.C. Mitogen-activated protein kinases in innate immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar, Ashwell, 2006Ashwell J.D. The many paths to p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in the immune system.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 532-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The p38MAPK family includes four isozymes: p38α (Mapk14), p38β (Mapk11), p38γ (Mapk12), and p38δ (Mapk13). Each is activated by phosphorylation following DNA damage, cytokine release, or generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), all of which are associated with stress conditions (Ashwell, 2006Ashwell J.D. The many paths to p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in the immune system.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 532-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Activated p38MAPK phosphorylates downstream targets to activate signals that manage cellular stresses; however, if p38MAPK activation is too strong, cells undergo apoptosis or cellular senescence (Iwasa et al., 2003Iwasa H. Han J. Ishikawa F. Mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 defines the common senescence-signalling pathway.Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Thus, p38MAPK signaling is a fate determinant of stressed cells. Aberrant ROS levels in HSPCs during BMT or following loss of the kinase ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) reportedly activate the p38MAPK/p16INK4a/Rb axis, resulting in HSPC defects, such as replicative senescence (Baudet et al., 2012Baudet A. Karlsson C. Safaee Talkhoncheh M. Galeev R. Magnusson M. Larsson J.

Med. 2006; 12: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Treatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or a p38MAPK inhibitor rescues HSPC number and function in serial BMT or Atm−/− cells in mice (Ito et al., 2004Ito K. Hirao A. Arai F. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Hamaguchi I. Nomiyama K. Hosokawa K. Sakurada K.

Med. 2006; 12: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Also, Mapk14 knockdown or p38MAPK inhibition promotes proper cell-cycle progression following BMT or in ex-vivo-expanded HSPCs (Baudet et al., 2012Baudet A. Karlsson C. Safaee Talkhoncheh M. Galeev R. Magnusson M. Larsson J.

Hematol. 2012; 91: 813-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, p38MAPK inhibition is thought to suppress aberrant HSPC proliferation and protect HSPCs from exhaustion or replicative senescence in stress settings or in the context of damage associated with aging (Geiger et al., 2013Geiger H. de Haan G. Florian M.C. The ageing haematopoietic stem cell compartment.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 376-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, Rossi et al., 2008Rossi D.J. Jamieson C.H. Weissman I.L. Stems cells and the pathways to aging and cancer.Cell. 2008; 132: 681-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). However, genetic evidence supporting this hypothesis is still limited. In this study, we identify p38α as the major p38MAPK isozyme highly expressed in HSPCs. We also perform conditional knockout of p38α in mice and observe phenotypes supporting its requirement for initiation of the HSPC cell cycle in stress hematopoiesis through activation of purine metabolic pathways. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel role for p38α-activated purine metabolism during stress hematopoiesis. To identify the predominant p38MAPK isozyme in BM compartments, we assessed expression of mRNAs encoding the four p38MAPK isozymes by qPCR of cDNAs from LT-HSCs, short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs), multipotent progenitors (MPPs), lineage marker (Lin)− c-Kit+ Sca-1− (LKS−) myeloid progenitors, and Lin+ fractions of wild-type BM. Among them, p38α was highly expressed in BM mononuclear cells (BMMNCs), and p38α expression levels were significantly higher in HSPC fractions than in fractions of differentiated cells (Figure S1A). p38β, p38γ, and p38δ were weakly expressed in hematopoietic cells, with the exception of moderate p38δ expression in the Lin+ fraction (Figure S1A), an activity attributable to expression in granulocytes (Figure S1B). Positive controls with specific primer sets showed efficient amplification of p38β, p38γ, and p38δ transcripts, confirming that low p38β, p38γ, and p38δ expression seen in HSPCs (Figure S1B) is not due to technical issues. To test p38α function, we chose to assess hematopoietic phenotypes in p38α-deficient mice. Conventional p38α knockout mice die between embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) and E12.5 due to non-cell-autonomous defects in definitive erythropoiesis (Tamura et al., 2000Tamura K. Sudo T. Senftleben U.

Thus, we took an inducible conditional knockout approach using the CAG-CreERT2:p38αflox/flox (p38αfl/fl) mouse (Hayashi and McMahon, 2002Hayashi S. McMahon A.P.

Biol. 2004; 24: 10611-10620Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), in which p38α deletion in vivo (p38αΔ/Δ) is induced globally by intraperitoneal (i.p.) tamoxifen (TAM) administration. 4 weeks after TAM administration, p38α deletion efficiency was quantified by qPCR of genomic DNA and found to be ∼80% in peripheral blood (PB) cells and ∼99% in HSPCs, based on comparisons with p38α+/+ animals treated with TAM (Figure S1C). p38α deletion efficiency in PBs slightly increased over time (Figure S1D). Expression levels of p38β, p38γ, and p38δ in p38αΔ/Δ HSPCs did not increase in a compensatory manner based on comparisons with wild-type controls (Figure S1E). By 4–8 weeks after TAM administration (that is, in 10- to 14-week-old mice), p38αΔ/Δ mice showed no overt phenotypes relative to p38α+/+ mice in terms of differentiation status among hematological systems, including PB, BM, spleen, and thymus (Figures S1F–S1J). Frequencies of various primitive hematopoietic cells (LT-HSCs, ST-HSCs, MPPs, and progenitors) were also indistinguishable in p38α+/+ and p38αΔ/Δ BM (Figure S1H). In addition, pyronin Y analysis indicated that the G0 fraction in CD34− LSK cells was identical between genotypes (data not shown). Thus, p38α is dispensable for steady-state hematopoiesis in young mice, despite the fact that it is expressed in wild-type hematopoietic cells. Given the function of p38α in the context of stress, we monitored how tolerant p38αΔ/Δ HSCs were of hematological stress by performing serial BMT. To do so, we intravenously transplanted lethally irradiated (9.5 Gy) recipient mice (CD45.1+) with 500 freshly isolated CD34−Flt3−LSK cells from p38α+/+ or p38αΔ/Δ mice (CD45.2+) with 4 × 105 competitor MNCs (CD45.1+). The number of residual p38αfl/fl (undeleted) cells in the p38αΔ/Δ cell-transplanted group did not increase over time (Figure S1K). Donor-derived PB chimerism of p38αΔ/Δ cell-transplanted recipients was lower than that of p38α+/+ cell-transplanted recipients (Figure 1A). Differentiation status of donor-derived cells in primary recipients did not differ significantly in samples of PB cells from different genotypes (Figure 1B). Donor-derived BM chimerism of p38αΔ/Δ cell-transplanted recipients showed the same trend as PB cells (Figure 1C). Four months after BMT, 1 × 106 BM MNCs from primary recipients were isolated and transplanted into lethally irradiated CD45.1+ secondary recipients. We observed lower relative PB and BM chimerism in the p38αΔ/Δ compared to the p38α+/+ cell-transplanted group in the secondary transplantation than in the primary one (Figures 1D and 1F). Differentiation status in secondary recipients was also identical between genotypes (Figure 1E). However, the frequency of HSCs was identical between genotypes (Figure S1L). Next, we utilized a chronological HSC competition model to test competitive stress resistance (or fitness) of p38αΔ/Δ HSCs in the presence of normal HSCs in the BM niche. To do so, we mixed CAG-CreERT2 (−)-p38αflox/flox or p38αfl/fl BMMNCs (CD45.2+) with CD45.1+ BMMNCs at a 1:1 ratio without TAM and transplanted cells into lethally irradiated recipient CD45.1+ mice. Six weeks later, donor-derived PB chimerism percentages were ∼50% in both CAG-CreERT2 (−)-p38αflox/flox and p38αfl/fl transplanted groups (data not shown). We then injected chimeras with TAM to induce p38α deletion in hematopoietic cells, including HSCs, in vivo. Donor-derived PB chimerism in p38αΔ/Δ cell-transplanted recipients gradually declined over time (Figure 1G). To assess HSC stress resistance in other stress contexts, we evaluated survival rate after injection of mice of both genotypes with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (Heissig et al., 2002Heissig B. Hattori K. Dias S. Friedrich M. Ferris B. Hackett N.R. Crystal R.G. Besmer P. Lyden D. Moore M.A. et al.Recruitment of stem and progenitor cells from the bone marrow niche requires MMP-9 mediated release of kit-ligand.Cell. 2002; 109: 625-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar), which eliminates differentiated hematopoietic cells and induces proliferation of quiescent HSCs. After a single administration of 5-FU, mortality was higher in p38αΔ/Δ mice than in p38α+/+ mice (Figure 1H). On the other hand, although p38α was highly expressed in BM niche cells, including LepR+ mesenchymal stromal and endothelial cells (Figure S1M), donor-derived PB and BM chimerism following reciprocal transplantation was comparable between genotypes (Figures S1N and S1O). Taken together, p38α loss in mice results in defects in stem cell capacity during stress hematopoiesis in vivo in a cell-autonomous manner. To gain further insight into p38MAPK function during hematological stress, we evaluated the time course of p38MAPK activation in stressful contexts. Upstream kinases phosphorylate and hence activate p38MAPK (Arthur and Ley, 2013Arthur J.S. Ley S.C. Mitogen-activated protein kinases in innate immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Thus, we evaluated p38MAPK phosphorylation levels as an indicator of activation using intracellular flow cytometry with anti-phosphorylated-p38MAPK (pp38MAPK) antibody. Given the predominant expression of p38α in hematopoietic cells (Figure S1A), we interpreted phosphorylation levels detected as reflective of those of p38α. At steady state, pp38MAPK levels were significantly higher in HSPCs than in differentiated cell fractions (Figure 2A), an observation consistent with p38α mRNA expression (Figure S1A). Next, we assessed pp38MAPK levels in BM after a single 5-FU injection. pp38MAPK protein was upregulated in all hematopoietic fractions, including LT-HSCs, on days 3 and 6 after injection. pp38MAPK induction was especially high in MPP and ST-HSC fractions (Figures 2B and S2C). LT-HSCs showed gradual increases in pp38MAPK levels on days 3 and 6, levels that were inversely correlated with PB cell decreases after 5-FU injection (Figure S2A). Increased pp38MAPK levels seen on day 3 after injection were clearly blunted in p38αΔ/Δ lineage-negative BM cells (Figure S2B), supporting the idea that pp38MAPK levels are attributable primarily to p38α phosphorylation. Next we evaluated pp38MAPK levels after BMT (Figures 2C–2F, S2D, and S2E). On day 1 after BMT, pp38MAPK was induced in HSPC fractions, including LT-HSCs (Figure 2C) and CD34+LSK (Figure 2D) and LKS− cells (Figure 2E); however, those levels rapidly decreased and returned to normal 7 days after BMT. p38MAPK protein levels slightly increased (by 1.29-fold) in LSKs at day 1 after BMT relative to pre-BMT levels (data not shown). By contrast, phosphorylation levels gradually increased and peaked by 3–4 days after BMT in Lin+ cells (including residual recipient cells) (Figure 2F). Taken together, activation of p38MAPK, particularly p38α, occurred immediately after hematological stress and returned to normal in a short period, suggesting that p38α functions rapidly after hematological stresses to activate downstream events. To identify events downstream of p38α after hematological stress, we initially evaluated mechanisms such as homing, apoptosis, and ROS generation immediately after BMT. To compare homing of transplanted p38αΔ/Δ or p38α+/+ HSCs, we determined the number of donor-derived cells in BM 16 hr after BMT. LT-HSC homing ability to recipient BM was identical between genotypes (Figure S3A). Donor-derived PB and BM chimerism of p38αΔ/Δ cell-transplanted recipients was lower than that of p38α+/+ cell-transplanted recipients following intra-femoral transplantation (Figures S3B and S3C), an effect similar to that seen following intravenous transplantation of p38αΔ/Δ LT-HSCs (Figures 1A and 1C). In addition, LT-HSC lodgment was comparable between the two genotypes after BMT (Figure S3D). Taken together, enhanced LT-HSC homing capacity does not occur downstream of p38α following transplantation. Second, we calculated the ratio of apoptotic to non-apoptotic cells of transplanted p38αΔ/Δ or p38α+/+ LT-HSCs. BMT or 5-FU treatment induced apoptosis in the LT-HSC fraction, as anticipated (Figure S3E); however, we observed no significant differences in frequency of Annexin V+ apoptotic cells in p38α+/+ and p38αΔ/Δ LT-HSC fractions after either BMT (Figure S3E) or 5-FU treatment (data not shown). Finally, BMT induced comparable ROS production in LT-HSCs of both genotypes (Figure S3F). Overall, we conclude that defects seen in p38αΔ/Δ HSCs after hematological stress cannot be explained by altered homing, apoptosis, or ROS production. Next, we focused on cell-cycle progression after BMT using the fluorescent label carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE). Because CFSE-labeled cells lose fluorescence at each cell division, the CFSE intensity reflects the cell division history of transplanted cells after BMT. For this analysis, we stained freshly isolated p38α+/+ or p38αΔ/Δ BMMNCs (CD45.2+) with CFSE and transplanted them into lethally irradiated CD45.1+ mice. We then analyzed donor-derived LT-HSCs on days 1, 2, 3, and 7 after BMT. CFSE fluorescence levels were significantly higher in mice transplanted with p38αΔ/Δ compared to p38α+/+ cells from days 1 to 3 after BMT (Figures 3A and 3B ), whereas CFSE fluorescence levels prior to BMT were identical between genotypes (data not shown). These defects were seen not only in LT-HSCs but also in ST-HSCs and MPPs (Figure S3G). In contrast, CFSE fluorescence was comparable in p38αΔ/Δ and p38α+/+ cells by 7 days after BMT (Figure 3A), suggesting that p38α deficiency delays cell division immediately after BMT. Furthermore, CFSE fluorescence was identical between genotypes after cells were transplanted into non-irradiated, hematopoiesis-defective c-Kit mutant (WBB6F1-KitW/KitW-v) mice (data not shown). We also performed a short-term bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay to assess HSPC cell-cycle kinetics during activation (Wilson et al., 2008Wilson A. Laurenti E. Oser G. van der Wath R.C. Blanco-Bose W. Jaworski M. Offner S. Dunant C.F. Eshkind L. Bockamp E. et al.Hematopoietic stem cells reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal during homeostasis and repair.Cell. 2008; 135: 1118-1129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). To do so, we transplanted CAG-CreERT2 (−)-p38αflox/flox or p38αfl/fl BMMNCs (Ly5.2) into lethally irradiated recipients (Ly5.1), administered TAM to BM-replaced chimeras 6 weeks later to delete p38α in hematopoietic cells, and then assessed short-term BrdU incorporation. BrdU incorporation was significantly lower in p38αΔ/Δ than in p38α+/+ BM chimeras in HSPC fractions (Figures 3C and S3H). Next, to analyze a potential cell-intrinsic requirement for p38α during LT-HSC cell-cycle progression, we cultured LT-HSCs with cytokines in the presence or absence of the general p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580. SB203580 treatment significantly suppressed cell proliferation in vitro relative to controls in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3D). Also, short-term 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation, which is more sensitive than BrdU incorporation, was significantly less in p38αΔ/Δ than in p38α+/+ LT-HSCs grown in liquid culture (Figure 3E). Transcriptome analysis of transplanted wild-type or p38αΔ/Δ LT-HSCs (16 hr after BMT) suggested that p38αΔ/Δ LT-HSCs showed lower enrichment of genes related to HSC-related markers and proliferation (Figure 3F). In fact, qPCR analysis confirmed that some genes encoding HSC-related markers were expressed at lower levels in p38αΔ/Δ relative to wild-type LT-HSCs (data not shown). However, other gene sets, including apoptosis- or ROS-related genes, were not altered in transplanted p38αΔ/Δ HSPCs (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that loss of p38α results in defective control of LT-HSC cell-cycle progression in stressed settings such as transplantation or ex vivo culture. Given that altered metabolic activities can change cell-cycle status (Takubo et al., 2010Takubo K. Goda N. Yamada W. Iriuchishima H. Ikeda E. Kubota Y. Shima H. Johnson R.S. Hirao A. Suematsu M.

Cell-state-specific metabolic dependency in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis.Cell. 2014; 158: 1309-1323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), we asked whether p38α regulation of a particular metabolic pathway could initiate HSPC cycling under stress conditions. To do so, we collected p38α+/+ or p38αΔ/Δ LSK cells either at steady state or 16 hr after BMT and extracted metabolites for metabolome analysis using mass spectrometry. Levels of most metabolites detected increased after BMT relative to levels seen at steady state (Figures S4A and S4B). Furthermore, most metabolites upregulated in transplanted p38α+/+ LSK cells showed lower levels in transplanted p38αΔ/Δ LSK cells (12 of 16 anionic metabolites and 19 of 24 cationic metabolites) (Figures S4A and S4B), suggesting that HSPC proliferation activates various metabolic pathways p38α dependently. Among metabolites surveyed, we focused on glycine and aspartic acid, as they were the only two of four metabolites assessed whose levels increased in p38αΔ/Δ cells (Figure 4A, left). Levels of both increased in p38αΔ/Δ as compared with p38α+/+ LSK cells after BMT (Figure 4A, right graphs). Also, transplanted p38αΔ/Δ LSK cells showed lower levels of allantoin, a product of purine catabolism, than transplanted p38α+/+ LSK cells (Figure 4A, right graph). These findings suggest that p38α loss suppresses purine metabolism during stress hematopoiesis. Next, we evaluated mRNAs encoding key enzymes functioning in purine metabolism by qPCR. Expression of both inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (Impdh) 2, the rate-limiting enzyme of guanosine monophosphate (GMP) synthesis, and guanosine monophosphate synthetase (Gmps) was significantly decreased in p38αΔ/Δ relative to p38α+/+ LT-HSCs on day 1 after BMT (Figure 4B). By day 2, however, expression of transcripts encoding these factors was comparable (Figure S4C). To confirm an effect of p38α on cell metabolism, we repeated metabolome analysis using EML-C1 cells and the drug SB203580. SB203580 treatment promoted decreased levels in the guanine nucleotide pool (Figure 4C) and decreased (1) 2-oxoglutarate levels; (2) the ΣPPP value, which is the sum of pentose phosphate pathway metabolites (gluconate + 6-phosphogluconate + ribulose 5-phosphate + ribose 5-phosphate + D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate + erythrose 4-phosphate); and (3) the glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio (Figure S4D; Table S2). These changes were likely not due to cell death, because the energy charge, a fundamental metabolic control parameter (Atkinson and Walton, 1967Atkinson D.E. Walton G.M. Adenosine triphosphate conservation in metabolic regulation. Rat liver citrate cleavage enzyme.J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3239-3241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was comparable in SB203580-treated and untreated groups (Figure S4D). These results indicate that p38α loss affects purine metabolism and expression of enzymes regulating that activity in HSPCs during cell-cycle progression. To assess how changes in purine metabolism could affect the HSC response to stress, we treated LT-HSCs with cytokines in the presence or absence of mycophenolic acid (MPA), an Impdh inhibitor. MPA treatment significantly suppressed colony-formation capacity of LT-HSCs in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4D). In addition, the incorporation of EdU into LT-HSCs was dose-dependently reduced by MPA (Figure 4E). In addition, isolated LT-HSCs were cultured with or without MPA for 3 days and then transplanted into recipients along with competitor cells from Ly5.1+ BM. PB chimerism was dose-dependently decreased in recipients of MPA-treated cells (Figure 4F). Next, to directly assess effects of Impdh inhibition in vivo, CFSE-labeled cells were pretreated with MPA and transplanted into recipient mice, which were then administered an additional, single injection of MPA. MPA-treated LT-HSCs showed higher CFSE fluorescence, suggesting that they undergo a delay in their initial division after BMT (Figure 4G). Finally, we evaluated the effect of Impdh inhibition during HSPC regeneration after BMT. To do so, BMMNCs were transplanted into recipient mice treated with or without mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; 300 mg/kg/day orally). MMF is an MPA prodrug with higher bioavailability and efficiency than MPA in vivo (Orvis et al., 2009Orvis A.K. Wesson S.K. Breza Jr., T.S. Church A.A. Mitchell C.L. Watkins S.W. Mycophenolate mofetil in dermatology.J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 2009; 60: 183-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). MMF decreased the donor-derived regeneration capacity, particularly in HSPCs, by day 4 after BMT (Figure 4H). These experiments suggest that Impdh is necessary to maintain LT-HSC cycling and repopulation capacity. To identify how p38α regulates purine enzymes, we searched two open-access databases for transcription factors capable of binding to promoter regions of genes that encode purine-related enzymes and are highly expressed in HSCs (Lachmann et al., 2010Lachmann A. Xu H. Krishnan J. Berger S.I. Mazloom A.R. Ma’ayan A.

Among candidates, we found that the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf) commonly binds promoters of purine-related genes and is highly expressed in HSCs. Mitf is also reportedly activated by p38MAPK (Khurana et al., 2013Khurana S. Buckley S. Schouteden S. Ekker S. Petryk A. Delforge M. Zwijsen A. Verf"
https://openalex.org/W2460218004,"Pluripotency is increasingly recognized as a spectrum of cell states defined by their growth conditions. Although naive and primed pluripotency states have been characterized molecularly, our understanding of events regulating state acquisition is wanting. Here, we performed comparative RNA sequencing of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and defined a pluripotent cell fate (PCF) gene signature associated with acquisition of naive and primed pluripotency. We identify Zfp281 as a key transcriptional regulator for primed pluripotency that also functions as a barrier toward achieving naive pluripotency in both mouse and human ESCs. Mechanistically, Zfp281 interacts with Tet1, but not Tet2, and its direct transcriptional target, miR-302/367, to negatively regulate Tet2 expression to establish and maintain primed pluripotency. Conversely, ectopic Tet2 alone, but not Tet1, efficiently reprograms primed cells toward naive pluripotency. Our study reveals a molecular circuitry in which opposing functions of Tet1 and Tet2 control acquisition of alternative pluripotent states."
https://openalex.org/W2463089356,"Objective Patients receiving chemotherapy often experience many different symptoms that can be difficult to alleviate and ultimately negatively influence their quality of life. Such symptoms include pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and retching, anxiety and depression. There is a gap in the relevant literature on the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural and relaxation techniques in symptom clusters. The study reflects this gap in the literature and aimed to test the effectiveness of Guided Imagery (GI) and Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) on a cluster of symptoms experienced by patients undergoing chemotherapy. Methods This was a randomized control trial with 208 patients equally assigned either in the intervention or the control group. Measurements in both groups were collected at baseline and at completion of intervention (4 weeks). Patients were assessed for pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and retching, anxiety and depression. The overall management of the cluster was also assessed based on the patients’ self-reported health related quality of life-HRQoL. Chi-square tests (X2), independent T-tests and Linear Mixed Models were calculated. Results Patients in the intervention group experienced lower levels of Fatigue (p<0.0.0225), and Pain (p = 0.0003) compared to those in the control group and experienced better HRQoL (p<0.0001) [PRE-POST: Intervention: Pain 4.2(2.5) - 2.5(1.6), Fatigue 27.6(4.1) - 19.3(4.1), HRQoL 54.9(22.7) - 64.5(23), Control: Pain 3.5(1.7) - 4.8(1.5), Fatigue 28.7(4.1) - 32.5(3.8), HRQoL 51.9(22.3)– 41.2(24.1)]. Nausea, vomiting and retching occurred significantly less often in the intervention group [pre-post: 25.4(5.9)– 20.6(5.6) compared to the control group (17.8(6.5)– 22.7(5.3) (F = 58.50 p<0.0001). More patients in the control group (pre:n = 33-post:n = 47) were found to be moderately depressed compared to those in the intervention group (pre:n = 35-post:n = 15) (X2 = 5.93; p = 0.02). Conclusion This study provided evidence that the combination of GI and PMR can be effective in the management of a cluster of symptoms in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. These techniques can complement existing management measures to achieve a comprehensive management of this symptom cluster and increase patients HRQoL.

The objectives of the trial were i) to compare the spectral reflectance of 3 turfgrasses acquired via UAV and by a ground-based instrument; ii) to test the sensitivity of the 2 data acquisition sources in detecting induced variation in N levels. N application gradients from 0 to 250 kg ha-1 were created on 3 different turfgrass species: Cynodon dactylon x transvaalensis (Cdxt) ‘Patriot’, Zoysia matrella (Zm) ‘Zeon’ and Paspalum vaginatum (Pv) ‘Salam’. Proximity and remote-sensed reflectance measurements were acquired using a GreenSeeker handheld crop sensor and a UAV with onboard a multispectral sensor, to determine Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Proximity-sensed NDVI is highly correlated with data acquired from UAV with r values ranging from 0.83 (Zm) to 0.97 (Cdxt). Relating NDVI-UAV with clippings N, the highest r is for Cdxt (0.95). The most reactive species to N fertilization is Cdxt with a clippings N% ranging from 1.2% to 4.1%. UAV imagery can adequately assess the N status of turfgrasses and its spatial variability within a species, so for large areas, such as golf courses, sod farms or race courses, UAV acquired data can optimize turf management. For relatively small green areas, a hand-held crop sensor can be a less expensive and more practical option."
https://openalex.org/W2472173303,"Studies have reported that interactions between keratins (KRTs) and other proteins initiate signaling cascades that regulate cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. In the current study, we found that expression of KRT19 was specifically high in breast cancers and significantly correlated with their invasiveness. Moreover, knockdown of KRT19 led to increased proliferation, migration, invasion, drug resistance, and sphere formation in breast cancer cells via an upregulated NOTCH signaling pathway. This was owing to reduced expression of NUMB, an inhibitory protein of the NOTCH signaling pathway. In addition, we found that KRT19 interacts with β-catenin/RAC1 complex and enhances the nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Concordantly, knockdown of KRT19 suppressed the nuclear translocation of β-catenin as well as β-catenin-mediated NUMB expression. Furthermore, modulation of KRT19-mediated regulation of NUMB and NOTCH1 expression led to the repression of the cancer stem cell properties of breast cancer patient-derived CD133high/CXCR4high/ALDH1high cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs), which showed very low KRT19 and high NOTCH1 expression. Taken together, our study suggests a novel function for KRT19 in the regulation of nuclear import of the β-catenin/RAC1 complex, thus modulating the NUMB-dependent NOTCH signaling pathway in breast cancers and CSLCs, which might bear potential clinical implications for cancer or CSLC treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2460372346,"Tumors utilize aerobic glycolysis to support growth and invasion. However, the molecular mechanisms that link metabolism with invasion are not well understood. The nutrient sensor O-linked-β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) modifies intracellular proteins with N-acetylglucosamine. Cancers display elevated O-GlcNAcylation and suppression of O-GlcNAcylation inhibits cancer invasion and metastasis. Here, we show that the regulation of cancer invasion by OGT is dependent on the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1. Reducing O-GlcNAcylation elevates SIRT1 levels and activity in an AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase α)-dependent manner. Reduced O-GlcNAcylation in cancer cells leads to SIRT1-mediated proteasomal degradation of oncogenic transcription factor FOXM1 in an MEK/ERK-dependent manner. SIRT1 is critical for OGT-mediated regulation of FOXM1 ubiquitination and reducing SIRT1 activity reverses OGT-mediated regulation of FOXM1. Moreover, we show that SIRT1 levels are required for OGT-mediated regulation of invasion and metastasis in breast cancer cells. Thus, O-GlcNAcylation is a central component linking metabolism to invasion and metastasis via an SIRT1/ERK/FOXM1 axis."
https://openalex.org/W2469987794,"In axons, an action potential (AP) is thought to be broadcast as an unwavering binary pulse over its arbor, driving neurotransmission uniformly at release sites. Yet by recording from axons of cerebellar stellate cell (SC) interneurons, we show that AP width varies between presynaptic bouton sites, even within the same axon branch. The varicose geometry of SC boutons alone does not impose differences in spike duration. Rather, axonal patching revealed heterogeneous peak conductance densities of currents mediated mainly by fast-activating Kv3-type potassium channels, with clustered hotspots at boutons and restricted expression at adjoining shafts. Blockade of Kv channels at individual boutons indicates that currents immediately local to a release site direct spike repolarization at that location. Thus, the clustered arrangement and variable expression density of Kv3 channels at boutons are key determinants underlying compartmentalized control of AP width in a near synapse-by-synapse manner, multiplying the signaling capacity of these structures."
https://openalex.org/W2461937652,"Aberrant p62 overexpression has been implicated in breast cancer development. Here, we found that p62 expression was elevated in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), including CD44+CD24− fractions, mammospheres, ALDH1+ populations and side population cells. Indeed, short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of p62 impaired breast cancer cells from self-renewing under anchorage-independent conditions, whereas ectopic overexpression of p62 enhanced the self-renewal ability of breast cancer cells in vitro. Genetic depletion of p62 robustly inhibited tumor-initiating frequencies, as well as growth rates of BCSC-derived tumor xenografts in immunodeficient mice. Consistently, immunohistochemical analysis of clinical breast tumor tissues showed that high p62 expression levels were linked to poorer clinical outcome. Further gene expression profiling analysis revealed that p62 was positively correlated with MYC expression level, which mediated the function of p62 in promoting breast cancer stem-like properties. MYC mRNA level was reduced upon p62 deletion by siRNA and increased with p62 overexpression in breast cancer cells, suggesting that p62 positively regulated MYC mRNA. Interestingly, p62 did not transactivate MYC promoter. Instead, p62 delayed the degradation of MYC mRNA by repressing the expression of let-7a and let-7b, thus promoting MYC mRNA stabilization at the post-transcriptional level. Consistently, let-7a and let-7b mimics attenuated p62-mediated MYC mRNA stabilization. Together, these findings unveiled a previously unappreciated role of p62 in the regulation of BCSCs, assigning p62 as a promising therapeutic target for breast cancer treatments."

It is essential to observe and examine the perceptions of residents towards tourists and tourism development for better planning in realizing successful and sustainable tourism development. Therefore, this research measured the relationship between residents' welcoming nature, emotional closeness, and sympathetic understanding (emotional solidarity) towards tourists and their respective attitudes towards supporting tourism development. To test the proposed research model, we collected data using a questionnaire survey from 333 residents in rural areas in Malaysia. We used the structural equation modelling technique (Amos) to evaluate the research model, and the results revealed that the residents' willingness (welcoming nature) to accept tourists is the strongest factor that effects the residents' attitudes towards supporting tourism development. However, there was no significant relationship between residents' emotional closeness and their sympathetic understanding towards tourists with their attitude and support towards tourism development. Welcoming nature, emotional closeness, and sympathetic understanding are able to predict 48% of residents' attitudes towards tourism development and 62% of their support towards tourism development."
https://openalex.org/W2467880644,"Sensory neurons are customarily characterized by one or more linearly weighted receptive fields describing sensitivity in sensory space and time. We show that in auditory cortical and thalamic neurons, the weight of each receptive field element depends on the pattern of sound falling within a local neighborhood surrounding it in time and frequency. Accounting for this change in effective receptive field with spectrotemporal context improves predictions of both cortical and thalamic responses to stationary complex sounds. Although context dependence varies among neurons and across brain areas, there are strong shared qualitative characteristics. In a spectrotemporally rich soundscape, sound elements modulate neuronal responsiveness more effectively when they coincide with sounds at other frequencies, and less effectively when they are preceded by sounds at similar frequencies. This local-context-driven lability in the representation of complex sounds—a modulation of “input-specific gain” rather than “output gain”—may be a widespread motif in sensory processing."
https://openalex.org/W2475368493,"Purpose We investigated if programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels were prognostic of survival outcomes after intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods and Materials 104 patients with non-metastatic NPC treated with radical IMRT were investigated for their PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) which were correlated with survival endpoints including locoregional failure-free survival (LRFFS), progression-free survival (PFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and overall survival (OS). Results After a median follow-up of 7.6 years, 21 (20.2%), 19 (18.3%) and 31 (29.8%) patients suffered from locoregional failure, distant metastases and overall disease progression, respectively, and 31 (29.8%) patients died. Patients whose tumors had PD-L1 IHC 2+ (moderate to strong membrane staining in ≥ 25% of tumor cells) enjoyed longer LRFFS (5-year 100% vs. 74.4%, Hazard ratio [HR], 0.159, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.021–0.988; P = 0.042) and marginally longer PFS (5-year 95.0% vs. 65.2%, HR, 0.351, 95% CI, 0.08–0.999, P = 0.067) compared to those whose tumors had PD-L1 IHC 0 (minimal membrane staining with PD-L1 in < 5% tumor cells or no staining with PD-L1) or 1+ (minimal to moderate membrane staining with PD-L1 in between 5–24% tumor cells). PD-L1 IHC 2+ was independently prognostic of both LRFFS (P = 0.014) and PFS (P = 0.045) in multivariable analyses. Only induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation was prognostic of DMFS (P = 0.003) and no prognostic factor for OS was identified. Conclusion PD-L1 expression levels correlated with LRRFS and PFS in non-metastatic NPC treated with radical IMRT. It may play a role in radiosensitivity for NPC, which should be further confirmed in prospective studies using immunotherapy together with IMRT."
https://openalex.org/W2470252718,"Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is characterized by high cancer cell heterogeneity and the presence of a complex tumor microenvironment. Those factors are a key obstacle for the treatment of this tumor type. To model the disease in mice, the current strategy is to grow GBM cells in serum-free non-adherent condition, which maintains their tumor-initiating potential. However, the so-generated tumors are histologically different from the one of origin. In this work, we performed high-throughput marker expression analysis and investigated the tumorigenicity of GBM cells enriched under different culture conditions. We identified a marker panel that distinguished tumorigenic sphere cultures from non-tumorigenic serum cultures (high CD56, SOX2, SOX9, and low CD105, CD248, αSMA). Contrary to previous work, we found that 'mixed cell cultures' grown in serum conditions are tumorigenic and express cancer stem cell (CSC) markers. As well, 1% serum plus bFGF and TGF-α preserved the tumorigenicity of sphere cultures and induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition gene expression. Furthermore, we identified 12 genes that could replace the 840 genes of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) used for GBM-subtyping. Our data suggest that the tumorigenicity of GBM cultures depend on cell culture strategies that retain CSCs in culture rather than the presence of serum in the cell culture medium."
https://openalex.org/W2470756338,"Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors limit myocardial injury caused by stresses, including doxorubicin chemotherapy. cGMP binding to PKG Iα attenuates oxidant-induced disulfide formation. Because PDE5 inhibition elevates cGMP and protects from doxorubicin-induced injury, we reasoned that this may be because it limits PKG Iα disulfide formation. To investigate the role of PKG Iα disulfide dimerization in the development of apoptosis, doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy was compared in male wild type (WT) or disulfide-resistant C42S PKG Iα knock-in (KI) mice. Echocardiography showed that doxorubicin treatment caused loss of myocardial tissue and depressed left ventricular function in WT mice. Doxorubicin also reduced pro-survival signaling and increased apoptosis in WT hearts. In contrast, KI mice were markedly resistant to the dysfunction induced by doxorubicin in WTs. In follow-on experiments the influence of the PDE5 inhibitor tadalafil on the development of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in WT and KI mice was investigated. In WT mice, co-administration of tadalafil with doxorubicin reduced PKG Iα oxidation caused by doxorubicin and also protected against cardiac injury and loss of function. KI mice were again innately resistant to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, and therefore tadalafil afforded no additional protection. Doxorubicin decreased phosphorylation of RhoA (Ser-188), stimulating its GTPase activity to activate Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) in WTs. These pro-apoptotic events were absent in KI mice and were attenuated in WTs co-administered tadalafil. PKG Iα disulfide formation triggers cardiac injury, and this initiation of maladaptive signaling can be blocked by pharmacological therapies that elevate cGMP, which binds kinase to limit its oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W2472019910,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a clinically validated target in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), where EGFR-blocking antibodies are approved for first-line treatment. However, as with other targeted therapies, intrinsic/acquired resistance mechanisms limit efficacy. In the FaDu HNSCC xenograft model, we show that combined blockade of EGFR and ERBB3 promotes rapid tumor regression, followed by the eventual outgrowth of resistant cells. RNA sequencing revealed that resistant cells express FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins, which were validated as drivers of the resistant phenotype by several approaches, including CRISPR-mediated inactivation of FGFR3-TACC3 fusion genes. Interestingly, analysis of signaling in resistant cell lines demonstrated that FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins promote resistance by preferentially substituting for EGFR/RAS/ERK signaling rather than ERBB3/PI3K/AKT signaling. Furthermore, although FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins promote resistance of additional EGFR-dependent HNSCC and lung cancer cell lines to EGFR blockade, they are unable to compensate for inhibition of PI3K signaling in PIK3CA-mutant HNSCC cell lines. Validation of FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins as endogenous drivers of resistance in our screen provides strong evidence that these fusions are capable of substituting for EGFR signaling. Thus, FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins may represent a novel mechanism of acquired resistance in EGFR-dependent cancers of multiple cell lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2465282122,"Background and Objectives High maternity-related health care spending is often cited as an important barrier in utilizing quality health care during pregnancy and childbirth. This study has two objectives: (i) to measure the levels of expenditure on total maternity care in disaggregated components such as ANCs, PNCs, and Natal care expenditure; (ii) to quantify the extent of catastrophic maternity expenditure (CME) incurred by households and identify the factors responsible for it. Methods and Findings Data from the 71st round of the National Sample Survey (2014) was used to estimate maternity expenditure and its predictors. CME was measured as a share of consumption expenditure by different cut-offs. The two-part model was used to identify the factors associated with maternity spending and CME. The findings show that household spending on maternity care (US$ 149 in constant price) is much higher than previous estimates (US$ 50 in constant price). A significant proportion of households in India (51%) are incurring CME. Along with economic and educational status, type of health care and place of residence emerged as significant factors in explaining CME. Conclusion Findings from this study assume importance in the context of an emerging demand for higher maternity entitlements and government spending on public health care in India. To reduce CME, India needs to improve the availability and accessibility of better-quality public health services and increase maternity entitlements in line with maternity expenditure identified in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2463263360,"Telling time and anticipating when external events will happen is among the most important tasks the brain performs. Yet the neural mechanisms underlying timing remain elusive. One theory proposes that timing is a general and intrinsic computation of cortical circuits. We tested this hypothesis using electrical and optogenetic stimulation to determine if brain slices could “learn” temporal intervals. Presentation of intervals between 100 and 500 ms altered the temporal profile of evoked network activity in an interval and pathway-specific manner—suggesting that the network learned to anticipate an expected stimulus. Recordings performed during training revealed a progressive increase in evoked network activity, followed by subsequent refinement of temporal dynamics, which was related to a time-window-specific increase in the excitatory-inhibitory balance. These results support the hypothesis that subsecond timing is an intrinsic computation and that timing emerges from network-wide, yet pathway-specific, changes in evoked neural dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2468887566,"Although single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in folate-mediated pathways predict susceptibility to choline deficiency during severe choline deprivation, it is unknown if effects persist at recommended intakes. Thus, we used stable isotope liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methodology to examine the impact of candidate SNPs on choline metabolism in a long-term, randomized, controlled feeding trial among pregnant, lactating, and nonpregnant (NP) women consuming 480 or 930 mg/d choline (22% as choline-d9, with d9 indicating a deuterated trimethyl amine group) and meeting folate-intake recommendations. Variants impairing folate metabolism, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) rs1801133, methionine synthase (MTR) rs1805087 [wild-type (WT)], MTR reductase (MTRR) rs1801394, and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFD1) rs2236225, influenced choline dynamics, frequently through interactions with reproductive state and choline intake, with fewer genotypic alterations observed among pregnant women. Women with these variants partitioned more dietary choline toward phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis via the cytidine diphosphate (CDP)-choline pathway at the expense of betaine synthesis even when use of betaine as a methyl donor was increased. Choline intakes of 930 mg/d restored partitioning of dietary choline between betaine and CDP-PC among NP (MTHFR rs1801133 and MTR rs1805087 WT) and lactating (MTHFD1 rs2236225) women with risk genotypes. Overall, our findings indicate that loss-of-function variants in folate-metabolizing enzymes strain cellular PC production, possibly via impaired folate-dependent phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PEMT)-PC synthesis, and suggest that women with these risk genotypes may benefit from choline intakes exceeding current recommendations.-Ganz, A.

https://openalex.org/W2465931908,"Infection with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes diarrhea, vomiting, and high mortality in suckling pigs. Contaminated feed has been suggested as a vehicle of transmission for PEDV. The objective of this study was to compare thermal and electron beam processing, and the inclusion of feed additives on the inactivation of PEDV in feed. Feed samples were spiked with PEDV and then heated to 120–145°C for up to 30 min or irradiated at 0–50 kGy. Another set of feed samples spiked with PEDV and mixed with Ultracid P (Nutriad), Activate DA (Novus International), KEM-GEST (Kemin Agrifood), Acid Booster (Agri-Nutrition), sugar or salt was incubated at room temperature (~25°C) for up to 21 days. At the end of incubation, the virus titers were determined by inoculation of Vero-81 cells and the virus inactivation kinetics were modeled using the Weibull distribution model. The Weibull kinetic parameter delta represented the time or eBeam dose required to reduce virus concentration by 1 log. For thermal processing, delta values ranged from 16.52 min at 120°C to 1.30 min at 145°C. For eBeam processing, a target dose of 50 kGy reduced PEDV concentration by 3 log. All additives tested were effective in reducing the survival of PEDV when compared with the control sample (delta = 17.23 days). Activate DA (0.81) and KEM-GEST (3.28) produced the fastest inactivation. In conclusion, heating swine feed at temperatures over 130°C or eBeam processing of feed with a dose over 50 kGy are effective processing steps to reduce PEDV survival. Additionally, the inclusion of selected additives can decrease PEDV survivability."
https://openalex.org/W2465425712,"The role of Notch signaling in prostate cancer has not been defined definitively. Several large scale tissue microarray studies have revealed that the expression of some Notch signaling components including the Jagged1 ligand are upregulated in advanced human prostate cancer specimens. Jagged1 expressed by tumor cells may activate Notch signaling in both adjacent tumor cells and cells in tumor microenvironment. However, it remains undetermined whether increased Jagged1 expression reflects a cause for or a consequence of tumor progression in vivo. To address this question, we generated a novel R26-LSL-JAG1 mouse model that enables spatiotemporal Jagged1 expression. Prostate specific upregulation of Jagged1 neither interferes with prostate epithelial homeostasis nor significantly accelerates tumor initiation or progression in the prostate-specific Pten deletion mouse model for prostate cancer. However, Jagged1 upregulation results in increased inflammatory foci in tumors and incidence of intracystic adenocarcinoma. In addition, Jagged1 overexpression upregulates Tgfβ signaling in prostate stromal cells and promotes progression of a reactive stromal microenvironment in the Pten null prostate cancer model. Collectively, Jagged1 overexpression does not significantly accelerate prostate cancer initiation and progression in the context of loss-of-function of Pten, but alters tumor histopathology and microenvironment. Our study also highlights an understudied role of Notch signaling in regulating prostatic stromal homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2466900436,"The plasma membrane-associated tyrosine phosphatase PTPRO is frequently transcriptionally repressed in cancers and signifies poor prognosis of breast cancer patients. In this study, deletion of Ptpro in MMTV-Erbb2 transgenic mice dramatically shortened the mammary tumor latency and accelerated tumor growth due to loss of Ptpro within the breast cancer cells but not in surrounding tissue as confirmed by hetero-transplantation studies. Both in vitro and in vivo data demonstrated that the phosphatase activity was required for the inactivation of ERBB2 and its downstream signaling. PTPRO regulated the phosphorylation status of ERBB2 at Y1248. Co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay (Duolink) indicated that PTPRO directly physically interacted with ERBB2. Moreover, PTPRO phosphatase activity shortened the half-life of ERBB2 by increasing endocytotic degradation. PTPRO reexpression by demethylation treatment using 5-azacytidine reduced the proliferation and colony formation potential in ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells. Taken together, PTPRO inhibited ERBB2-driven breast cancer through dephosphorylation leading to dual effects of ERBB2 signaling suppression and endosomal internalization of ERBB2, Therefore, reexpression of PTPRO may be a potential therapy for ERBB2-overexpressing breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2460822625,"Retrograde signaling is a mechanism by which mitochondrial dysfunction is communicated to the nucleus for inducing a metabolic shift essential for cell survival. Previously, we showed that partial mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion in different cell types induced mitochondrial retrograde signaling pathway (MtRS) involving Ca+2-sensitive Calcineurin (Cn) activation as an immediate upstream event of stress response. In multiple cell types, this stress signaling was shown to induce tumorigenic phenotypes in immortalized cells. In this study we show that MtRS also induces p53 expression, which was abrogated by Ca2+ chelators and short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of CnAβ mRNA. Mitochondrial dysfunction induced by mitochondrial ionophore, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone and other respiratory inhibitors, which perturb the transmembrane potential, were equally efficient in inducing the expression of p53 and downregulation of MDM2. Stress-induced p53 physically interacted with hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and attenuated the latter’s binding to promoter DNA motifs. In addition, p53 promoted ubiquitination and degradation of HIF-1α in partial mtDNA-depleted cells. The mtDNA depleted cells, with inhibited HIF-1α, showed upregulation of glycolytic pathway genes, glucose transporter 1–4 (Glut1–4), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 and Glucokinase but not of prolyl hydroxylase isoforms. For the first time we show that p53 is induced as part of MtRS and it renders HIF-1α inactive by physical interaction. In this respect, our results show that MtRS induces tumor growth independent of the HIF-1α pathway."

TAS2Rs are difficult to express in heterologous systems, with most receptors being trapped intracellularly. We find, however, that co-expression of β2-adrenergic receptors (β2AR) in HEK-293T routes TAS2R14 to the cell surface by forming receptor heterodimers. Cell surface TAS2R14 expression was increased by ∼5-fold when β2AR was co-expressed. Heterodimer formation was shown by co-immunoprecipitation with tagged receptors, biomolecular fluorescence complementation, and merged confocal images. The dynamic nature of this interaction was shown by: a gene-dose relationship between transfected β2AR and TAS2R14 expression, enhanced (up to 3-fold) TAS2R14 agonist stimulation of [Ca2+]i with β2AR co-transfection, ∼53% decrease in [Ca2+]i signaling with shRNA knockdown of β2AR in H292 cells, and ∼60% loss of [Ca2+]i responsiveness in βAR knock-out mouse ASM. Once expressed on the surface, we detected unidirectional, conformation-dependent, interaction within the heterodimer, with β2AR activation rapidly uncoupling TAS2R14 function (∼65% desensitization). Cross-talk was independent of β2AR internalization and cAMP/PKA, and not accompanied by TAS2R14 internalization. With prolonged β-agonist exposure, TAS2R14 internalized, consistent with slow recycling of naked TAS2R14 in the absence of the heterodimeric milieu. In studies of ASM mechanics, rapid cross-talk was confirmed at the physiologic level, where relaxation from TAS2R14 agonist was decreased by ∼50% with β-agonist co-treatment. Thus the β2AR acts as a double-edged sword: increasing TAS2R14 cell surface expression, but when activated by β-agonist, partially offsetting the expression phenotype by direct receptor:receptor desensitization of TAS2R14 function.

The US and MRCP studies were both performed on 64 neonates and young infants with BA (n = 41) or without BA (non-BA) (n = 23). Two observers reviewed independently the US alone set and the combined US and MRCP set, and graded them using a five-point scale. Diagnostic performance was compared using pairwise comparison of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value were assessed.The diagnostic performance (the area under the ROC curve [Az]) for diagnosing BA improved significantly after additional review of MRCP images; Az improved from 0.688 to 0.901 (P = .015) for observer 1 and from 0.676 to 0.901 (P = .011) for observer 2. The accuracy of MRCP combined with US (observer 1, 95% [61/64]; observer 2 92% [59/64]) and PPV (observer 1, 95% [40/42]; observer 2 91% [40/44]) were significantly higher than those of US alone for both observers (accuracy: observer 1, 73% [47/64], P = 0.003; observer 2, 72% [46/64], P = 0.004; PPV: observer 1, 76% [35/46], P = 0.016; observer 2, 76% [34/45], P = 0.013). Interobserver agreement of confidence levels was good for US alone (ĸ = 0.658, P < .001) and was excellent for the combined set of US and MRCP (ĸ = 0.929, P < .001).Better diagnostic performance was achieved with the combination of US and MRCP than with US alone for the evaluation of BA in neonates and young infants with cholestasis."
https://openalex.org/W2475147046,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can be curative for many hematologic diseases. However, complications such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and relapse of primary malignancy remain significant and are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Effects of killer Ig-like receptors (KIR)-influenced NK cells on HCT outcomes have been extensively pursued over the last decade. However, the relevance of the reported algorithms on HLA matched myeloablative HCT with rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is used for GVHD prophylaxis remains elusive. Here we examined the role of KIR and KIR-ligands of donor-recipient pairs in modifying the outcomes of ATG conditioned HLA matched sibling and unrelated donor HCT.The study cohort consisted of 281 HLA matched sibling and unrelated donor-recipient pairs of first allogeneic marrow or blood stem cell transplantation allocated into 'discovery' (135 pairs) and 'validation' (146 pairs) cohorts. High resolution HLA typing was obtained from the medical charts and KIR gene repertoires were obtained by a Luminex® based SSO method. All surviving patients were followed-up for a minimum of two years. KIR and HLA class I distributions of HCT pairs were stratified as per applicable definitions and were tested for their association with cause specific outcomes [acute GVHD grade II-IV (aGVHD), chronic GVHD needing systemic therapy (cGVHD) and relapse] using a multivariate competing risks regression model as well as with survival outcomes [relapse-free survival (RFS), cGVHD & relapse free survival (cGRFS) and overall survival (OS)] by multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model. A significant association between KIR genotype mismatching (KIR-B/x donor into KIR-AA recipient or vice versa) and cGVHD was found in both discovery (p = 0.001; SHR = 2.78; 95%CI: 1.50-5.17) and validation cohorts (p = 0.005; SHR = 2.61; 95%CI: 1.33-5.11). High incidence of cGVHD associated with KIR genotype mismatching was applicable to both sibling and unrelated donors and was specific to recipients who had one or two C1 bearing HLA-C epitopes (HLA-C1/x, p = 0.001; SHR = 2.40; 95%CI: 1.42-4.06). When compared with KIR genotype mismatched transplants, HLA-C1/x patients receiving grafts from KIR genotype matched donors had a significantly improved cGRFS (p = 0.013; HR = 1.62; 95%CI: 1.11-2.39). Although there was no effect of KIR genotype matching on survival outcomes, a significantly reduced incidence of relapse (p = 0.001; SHR = 0.22; 95%CI: 0.10-0.54) and improved relapse-free survival (p = 0.038; HR = 0.40; 95%CI: 0.17-0.95) was observed with one or more missing ligands for donor inhibitory KIR among the recipients of unrelated donor transplants.The present study for the first time presents the beneficial effects of KIR genotype matching in reducing cGVHD in myeloablative transplant setting using HLA matched (sibling and unrelated) donors. The findings offer a clinically applicable donor selection strategy that can help control cGVHD without affecting the risk of relapse and/or identify patients at a high risk of developing cGVHD as potential candidates for preemptive therapy. The findings also affirm the beneficial effect of one or more missing inhibitory KIR ligands in the recipient in reducing relapse and improving a relapse free survival in unrelated donor transplants."
https://openalex.org/W2464609357,"Numerous experiments, mostly performed in particular environments, have shown positive diversity-productivity relationships. Although the complementary use of resources is discussed as an important mechanism explaining diversity effects, less is known about how resource availability controls the strength of diversity effects and how this response depends on the functional composition of plant communities. We studied aboveground biomass production in experimental monocultures, two- and four-species mixtures assembled from two independent pools of four perennial grassland species, each representing two functional groups (grasses, forbs) and two growth statures (small, tall), and exposed to different combinations of light and nutrient availability. On average, shade led to a decrease in aboveground biomass production of 24% while fertilization increased biomass production by 36%. Mixtures were on average more productive than expected from their monocultures (relative yield total, RYT>1) and showed positive net diversity effects (NE: +34% biomass increase; mixture minus mean monoculture biomass). Both trait-independent complementarity effects (TICE: +21%) and dominance effects (DE: +12%) positively contributed to net diversity effects, while trait-dependent complementarity effects were minor (TDCE: +1%). Shading did not alter diversity effects and overyielding. Fertilization decreased RYT and the proportion of biomass gain through TICE and TDCE, while DE increased. Diversity effects did not increase with species richness and were independent of functional group or growth stature composition. Trait-based analyses showed that the dominance of species with root and leaf traits related to resource conservation increased TICE. Traits indicating the tolerance of shade showed positive relationships with TDCE. Large DE were associated with the dominance of species with tall growth and low diversity in leaf nitrogen concentrations. Our field experiment shows that positive diversity effects are possible in grass-forb mixtures irrespective of differences in light availability, but that the chance for the complementary use of resources increases when nutrients are not available at excess."
https://openalex.org/W2472445905,"Despite constituting approximately two thirds of all breast cancers, the luminal A and B tumours are poorly classified at both clinical and molecular levels. There are contradictory reports on the nature of these subtypes: some define them as intrinsic entities, others as a continuum. With the aim of addressing these uncertainties and identifying molecular signatures of patients at risk, we conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic and genomic analysis of 2,425 luminal breast cancer samples. Our results indicate that the separation between the molecular luminal A and B subtypes—per definition—is not associated with intrinsic characteristics evident in the differentiation between other subtypes. Moreover, t-SNE and MST-kNN clustering approaches based on 10,000 probes, associated with luminal tumour initiation and/or development, revealed the close connections between luminal A and B tumours, with no evidence of a clear boundary between them. Thus, we considered all luminal tumours as a single heterogeneous group for analysis purposes. We first stratified luminal tumours into two distinct groups by their HER2 gene cluster co-expression: HER2-amplified luminal and ordinary-luminal. The former group is associated with distinct transcriptomic and genomic profiles, and poor prognosis; it comprises approximately 8% of all luminal cases. For the remaining ordinary-luminal tumours we further identified the molecular signature correlated with disease outcomes, exhibiting an approximately continuous gene expression range from low to high risk. Thus, we employed four virtual quantiles to segregate the groups of patients. The clinico-pathological characteristics and ratios of genomic aberrations are concordant with the variations in gene expression profiles, hinting at a progressive staging. The comparison with the current separation into luminal A and B subtypes revealed a substantially improved survival stratification. Concluding, we suggest a review of the definition of luminal A and B subtypes. A proposition for a revisited delineation is provided in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2460237954,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been documented as having an important role in the development of cancer. Broccoli is very popular in large groups of the population and has anticancer properties. Junctional adhesion molecule A (JAMA) is preferentially concentrated at tight junctions and influences cell morphology and migration. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental program associated with cancer progression and metastasis. In this study we aimed to investigate the role of miRNAs from broccoli in human nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). We demonstrated that a total of 84 conserved miRNAs and 184 putative novel miRNAs were found in broccoli by sequencing technology. Among these, miR156a was expressed the most. In addition, synthetic miR156a mimic inhibited the EMT of NPC cells in vitro. Furthermore, it was confirmed that JAMA was the target of miR156a mimic as validated by 3’ UTR luciferase reporter assays and western blotting. Knockdown of JAMA was consistent with the effects of miR156a mimic on the EMT of NPC, and the up-regulation of JAMA could partially restore EMT repressed by miR156a mimic. In conclusion, these results indicate that the miR156a mimic inhibits the EMT of NPC cells by targeting the 3’ UTR of JAMA. These miRNA profiles of broccoli provide a fundamental basis for further research. Moreover, the discovery of miR156a may have clinical implications for the treatment of patients with NPC."

Previous studies show that personal prevention against tick bites is key, and certain factors namely, knowledge, experience of tick bites, and health beliefs influence compliance with tick bites preventive behaviour. This study aimed to assess these factors and their associations with tick bite preventive practices among Malaysian farmworkers.A total of eight cattle, goat and sheep farms in six states in Peninsular Malaysia participated in a cross-sectional survey between August and October 2013.A total of 151 (72.2%) out of 209 farmworkers answered the questionnaire. More than half of the farmworkers (n = 91) reported an experience of tick bites. Farms with monthly acaricide treatment had significantly (P<0.05) a low report of tick bites. Tick bite exposure rates did not differ significantly among field workers and administrative workers. The mean total knowledge score of ticks for the overall farmworkers was 13.6 (SD±3.2) from 20. The mean total tick bite preventive practices score for all farmworkers was 8.3 (SD±3.1) from 15. Fixed effect model showed the effects of four factors on tick bite prevention: (1) farms, (2) job categories (administrative workers vs. field workers), (3) perceived severity of tick bites, and (4) perceived barriers to tick bite prevention.A high proportion of farmworkers, including administrative workers, reported an experience of tick bites. The effectiveness of monthly acaricide treatment was declared by low reports of tick bites on these farms. Tick bite preventive practices were insufficient, particularly in certain farms and for administrative workers. Our findings emphasise the need to have education programmes for all farmworkers and targeting farms with low prevention practices. Education and health programmes should increase the perception of the risk of tick bites and remove perceived barriers of tick bite prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2467171485,"We used targeted next generation deep-sequencing (Safe Sequencing System) to measure ultra-rare de novo mutation frequencies in the human male germline by attaching a unique identifier code to each target DNA molecule. Segments from three different human genes (FGFR3, MECP2 and PTPN11) were studied. Regardless of the gene segment, the particular testis donor or the 73 different testis pieces used, the frequencies for any one of the six different mutation types were consistent. Averaging over the C>T/G>A and G>T/C>A mutation types the background mutation frequency was 2.6x10-5 per base pair, while for the four other mutation types the average background frequency was lower at 1.5x10-6 per base pair. These rates far exceed the well documented human genome average frequency per base pair (~10−8) suggesting a non-biological explanation for our data. By computational modeling and a new experimental procedure to distinguish between pre-mutagenic lesion base mismatches and a fully mutated base pair in the original DNA molecule, we argue that most of the base-dependent variation in background frequency is due to a mixture of deamination and oxidation during the first two PCR cycles. Finally, we looked at a previously studied disease mutation in the PTPN11 gene and could easily distinguish true mutations from the SSS background. We also discuss the limits and possibilities of this and other methods to measure exceptionally rare mutation frequencies, and we present calculations for other scientists seeking to design their own such experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2464375337,"The binary toxin from Lysinibacillus sphaericus has been successfully used for controlling mosquito-transmitted diseases. An activation step shortens both subunits BinA and BinB before their interaction with membranes and internalization in midgut cells, but the precise role of this activation step is unknown. Herein, we show conclusively using three orthogonal biophysical techniques that protoxin subunits form only monomers in aqueous solution. However, in vitro activated toxins readily form heterodimers. This oligomeric state did not change after incubation of these heterodimers with detergent. These results are consistent with the evidence that maximal toxicity in mosquito larvae is achieved when the two subunits, BinA and BinB, are in a 1:1 molar ratio, and directly link proteolytic activation to heterodimerization. Formation of a heterodimer must thus be necessary for subsequent steps, e.g., interaction with membranes, or with a suitable receptor in susceptible mosquito species. Lastly, despite existing similarities between BinB C-terminal domain with domains 3 and 4 of pore-forming aerolysin, no aerolysin-like SDS-resistant heptameric oligomers were observed when the activated Bin subunits were incubated in the presence of detergents or lipidic membranes."

The mechanism by which post-synaptic signals from the retinal network generate spikes is determined by each cell’s intrinsic electrical properties. Here we investigate the frequency responses of morphologically identified rat RGCs using intracellular injection of sinusoidal current waveforms, to assess their intrinsic capabilities with minimal contributions from the retinal network. Recorded cells were classified according to their morphological characteristics (A, B, C or D-type) and their stratification (inner (i), outer (o) or bistratified) in the inner plexiform layer (IPL). Most cell types had low- or band-pass frequency responses. A2, C1 and C4o cells were band-pass with peaks of 15–30 Hz and low-pass cutoffs above 56 Hz (A2 cells) and ~42 Hz (C1 and C4o cells). A1 and C2i/o cells were low-pass with peaks of 10–15 Hz (cutoffs 19–25 Hz). Bistratified D1 and D2 cells were also low-pass with peaks of 5–10 Hz (cutoffs ~16 Hz). The least responsive cells were the B2 and C3 types (peaks: 2–5 Hz, cutoffs: 8–11 Hz). We found no difference between cells stratifying in the inner and outer IPL (i.e., ON and OFF cells) or between cells with large and small somas or dendritic fields. Intrinsic physiological properties (input resistance, spike width and sag) had little impact on frequency response at low frequencies, but account for 30–40% of response variability at frequencies >30 Hz."
https://openalex.org/W2515772860,"Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2)-induced sepsis and meningitis are often accompanied by bacteremia. The evasion of polymorphonuclear leukocyte-mediated phagocytic clearance is central to the establishment of bacteremia caused by S. suis 2 and is facilitated by the ability of factor H (FH)-binding protein (Fhb) to bind FH on the bacterial surface, thereby impeding alternative pathway complement activation and phagocytic clearance. Here, C3b/C3d was found to bind to Fhb, along with FH, forming a large immune complex. The formation of this immune complex was mediated by domain II of Fhb via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, which, to our knowledge, is a new type of interaction. Interestingly, Fhb was found to be associated with the cell envelope and also present in the culture supernatant, where secreted Fhb inhibited complement activation via interactions with domain II, thereby enhancing antiphagocytic clearance by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Thus, Fhb is a multifunctional bacterial protein, which binds host complement component C3 as well as FH and interferes with innate immune recognition in a secret protein manner. S. suis 2 therefore appears to have developed a new strategy to combat host innate immunity and enhance survival in host blood."

It is now widely accepted that the inflammatory response is not an exclusively destructive process. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms needed for proper regulation still remain to be elucidated. Here, we propose an in vitro labelling strategy for multimodal in vivo observation of macrophage dynamics distinguished from brain-residing microglia response. Prior to intracerebral transplantation into the striatum of recipient mice or systemic administration, monocytes and macrophages, isolated from luciferase-expressing mice, were labelled with superparamagnetic iron oxide particles. Temporo-spatial localization was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging, whereas survival of grafted cells was investigated using bioluminescence imaging. The labelling procedure of the isolated cells did not significantly influence cell characteristics and resulted in detection of as few as 500 labelled cells in vivo. Two weeks after stereotactic transplantation, the luciferase signal was sustained traceable, with approximately 18% of the original luciferase signal detectable for monocytes and about 30% for macrophages. Hypointensity in MRI of the graft appeared unaltered in spatial location. In a therapeutically relevant approach, systemic cell administration after stroke resulted in accumulation mostly in thoracic regions, as could be visualized with BLI. For detection of homing to ischemic brain tissue more cells need to be administered. Nevertheless, during parallel MRI sessions recruitment of i.v. injected cells to the lesion site could be detected by day 2 post stroke as scattered hypointense signal voids. With further increase in sensitivity, our multi-facetted labelling strategy will provide the basis for in vivo tracking and fate specification of tissue-infiltrating macrophages and their distinct role in stroke-related neuro-inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2461910967,"Recent clinical trials have shown that in vivo and ex vivo gene therapy strategies can be an option for the treatment of several neurological disorders. Both strategies require efficient and safe vectors to 1) deliver the therapeutic gene directly into the CNS or 2) to genetically modify stem cells that will be used as Trojan horses for the systemic delivery of the therapeutic protein. A group of target diseases for these therapeutic strategies are mitochondrial encephalopathies due to mutations in nuclear DNA genes. In this study, we have developed a lentiviral vector (CCoq9WP) able to overexpress Coq9 mRNA and COQ9 protein in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) from Coq9R239X mice, an animal model of mitochondrial encephalopathy due to primary Coenzyme Q (CoQ) deficiency. Ectopic over-expression of Coq9 in both cell types restored the CoQ biosynthetic pathway and mitochondrial function, improving the fitness of the transduced cells. These results show the potential of the CCoq9WP lentiviral vector as a tool for gene therapy to treat mitochondrial encephalopathies."
