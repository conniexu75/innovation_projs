But their control group was limited to psychiatric patients with diagnoses other than schizophrenia. Such a sample may be expected to differ from the normal population in various respects, including birth order."

https://openalex.org/W2092996082,"DIPLOID spermatozoa have been found in mouse, rabbit, bull (reviewed by Beatty1) and man2,3. In the rabbit they form 0.03% of the total sperm and in the bull 0.1% to 0.17%, but the incidence in man is not known. Because such sperm could well be involved in the formation of triploid embryos, which are almost invariably aborted in man4, knowledge of their frequency would be of interest."

https://openalex.org/W1583381915,"Abstract 1. A modified procedure is presented for the isolation from Escherichia coli Q13 of the protein Factor T necessary for GTP-dependent polyuridylate-directed synthesis of polyphenylalanine. 2. Factor T forms a stable ternary complex with GTP and phenylalanyl-tRNA, as determined by gel filtration, but not with either one alone. Other nucleoside triphosphates cannot substitute for GTP in complex formation nor can N-formylmethionyl-tRNA or deacylated tRNA replace phenylalanyl-tRNA. Factor T also forms a complex with GDP, but this reaction is not stimulated by phenylalanyl-tRNA. 3. Competition and labeling studies reveal that the predominant species bound to membrane filters by T factor is GDP and not GTP. Label from 3H-GTP is bound primarily as the result of hydrolysis to 3H-GDP by a GTPase activity which is associated with the T factor preparation. In the absence of aminoacyl-tRNA, T-GTP-aminoacyl-tRNA is not retained on membrane filters. 4. Two complexes of T factor, T-GDP and T-GTP-Phe-tRNA, are interchangeable through a dynamic equilibrium. T-GTP*-Phe-tRNA + GDP ⇌ T-GDP + GTP* + Phe-tRNA 5. The ternary complex (T-GTP-Phe-tRNA) efficiently transfers phenylalanyl-tRNA to ribosomes in the presence of polyuridylate with the concomitant hydrolysis of GTP to GDP and Pi; this reaction is unaffected by fusidic acid. The GDP formed is bound to protein, presumably T factor. For every molecule of phenylalanyl-tRNA transferred to ribosomes, 1 molecule of GTP is hydrolyzed and 1 molecule of the resulting GDP is bound to protein."

The results are consistent with the presence of short parallel double helical segments in the transfer RNA molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2018340097,"IT is well known that there is no increase in the number of adipose cells in many kinds of experimental obesity. In genetically obese mice, obob obese hyperglycaemic1,2 or yellow obese3 syndromes as well as in hypothalamic obesities produced by aurothioglucose in mice4 or stereotaxic lesions in rats5, there is only an enlargement of the adipose cells. The same results are obtained in rats made obese by a high fat diet6. There is only one known exception to this rule: obesity induced by a high fat diet in female mice7, in which the number of cells is increased by a factor of 2.5. Because male animals were used in all experiments except the last, the question arises whether there may be a sex difference in the adipose tissue development in obese animals."

I do not criticize him, of course, for preferring to translate my visual “basic rectangle” into a standard type of index, which he calls “the BRM index”, but it is his attempt to utilize this index to refute my claim that Kenyapithecus africanus is taxonomically within the family Hominidae that requires critical comment."
