https://openalex.org/W2031468096,"Human and animal diet reconstruction studies that rely on tissue chemical signatures aim at providing estimates on the relative intake of potential food groups. However, several sources of uncertainty need to be considered when handling data. Bayesian mixing models provide a natural platform to handle diverse sources of uncertainty while allowing the user to contribute with prior expert information. The Bayesian mixing model FRUITS (Food Reconstruction Using Isotopic Transferred Signals) was developed for use in diet reconstruction studies. FRUITS incorporates the capability to account for dietary routing, that is, the contribution of different food fractions (e.g. macronutrients) towards a dietary proxy signal measured in the consumer. FRUITS also provides relatively straightforward means for the introduction of prior information on the relative dietary contributions of food groups or food fractions. This type of prior may originate, for instance, from physiological or metabolic studies. FRUITS performance was tested using simulated data and data from a published controlled animal feeding experiment. The feeding experiment data was selected to exemplify the application of the novel capabilities incorporated into FRUITS but also to illustrate some of the aspects that need to be considered when handling data within diet reconstruction studies. FRUITS accurately predicted dietary intakes, and more precise estimates were obtained for dietary scenarios in which expert prior information was included. FRUITS represents a useful tool to achieve accurate and precise food intake estimates in diet reconstruction studies within different scientific fields (e.g. ecology, forensics, archaeology, and dietary physiology)."
https://openalex.org/W2071344265,"Neuroimmune gene induction is involved in many brain pathologies including addiction. Although increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines has been found in ethanol-treated mouse brain and rat brain slice cultures as well as in post-mortem human alcoholic brain, the mechanisms remain elusive. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein is a nuclear protein that has endogenous cytokine-like activity. We previously found increased HMGB1 in post-mortem alcoholic human brain as well as in ethanol treated mice and rat brain slice cultures. The present study investigated the mechanisms for ethanol-induced release of HMGB1 and neuroimmune activation in a model of rat hippocampal-entorhinal cortex (HEC) brain slice cultures. Ethanol exposure triggered dose-dependent HMGB1 release, predominantly from neuronal cells. Inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACs) promoted nucleocytoplasmic mobilization of HDAC1/4 and HMGB1 resulting in increased total HMGB1 and acetylated HMGB1 release. Similarly, ethanol treatment was found to induce the translocation of HDAC1/4 and HMGB1 proteins from nuclear to cytosolic fractions. Furthermore, ethanol treatment reduced HDAC1/4 mRNA and increased acetylated HMGB1 release into the media. These results suggest decreased HDAC activity may be critical in regulating acetylated HMGB1 release from neurons in response to ethanol. Ethanol and HMGB1 treatment increased mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-1β as well as toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Targeting HMGB1 or microglial TLR4 by using siRNAs to HMGB1 and TLR4, HMGB1 neutralizing antibody, HMGB1 inhibitor glycyrrhizin and TLR4 antagonist as well as inhibitor of microglial activation all blocked ethanol-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-1β. These results support the hypothesis that ethanol alters HDACs that regulate HMGB1 release and that danger signal HMGB1 as endogenous ligand for TLR4 mediates ethanol-induced brain neuroimmune signaling through activation of microglial TLR4. These findings provide new therapeutic targets for brain neuroimmune activation and alcoholism."
https://openalex.org/W2145653859,"The misfolding of intrinsically disordered proteins such as α-synuclein, tau and the Aβ peptide has been associated with many highly debilitating neurodegenerative syndromes including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Therapeutic targeting of the monomeric state of such intrinsically disordered proteins by small molecules has, however, been a major challenge because of their heterogeneous conformational properties. We show here that a combination of computational and experimental techniques has led to the identification of a drug-like phenyl-sulfonamide compound (ELN484228), that targets α-synuclein, a key protein in Parkinson's disease. We found that this compound has substantial biological activity in cellular models of α-synuclein-mediated dysfunction, including rescue of α-synuclein-induced disruption of vesicle trafficking and dopaminergic neuronal loss and neurite retraction most likely by reducing the amount of α-synuclein targeted to sites of vesicle mobilization such as the synapse in neurons or the site of bead engulfment in microglial cells. These results indicate that targeting α-synuclein by small molecules represents a promising approach to the development of therapeutic treatments of Parkinson's disease and related conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2011514820,"Constraint-based models of metabolic networks are typically underdetermined, because they contain more reactions than metabolites. Therefore the solutions to this system do not consist of unique flux rates for each reaction, but rather a space of possible flux rates. By uniformly sampling this space, an estimated probability distribution for each reaction’s flux in the network can be obtained. However, sampling a high dimensional network is time-consuming. Furthermore, the constraints imposed on the network give rise to an irregularly shaped solution space. Therefore more tailored, efficient sampling methods are needed. We propose an efficient sampling algorithm (called optGpSampler), which implements the Artificial Centering Hit-and-Run algorithm in a different manner than the sampling algorithm implemented in the COBRA Toolbox for metabolic network analysis, here called gpSampler. Results of extensive experiments on different genome-scale metabolic networks show that optGpSampler is up to 40 times faster than gpSampler. Application of existing convergence diagnostics on small network reconstructions indicate that optGpSampler converges roughly ten times faster than gpSampler towards similar sampling distributions. For networks of higher dimension (i.e. containing more than 500 reactions), we observed significantly better convergence of optGpSampler and a large deviation between the samples generated by the two algorithms. Availability: optGpSampler for Matlab and Python is available for non-commercial use at: http://cs.ru.nl/~wmegchel/optGpSampler/."
https://openalex.org/W1967220324,"Rapid identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of microorganisms causing bloodstream infections or sepsis have the potential to improve patient care. This proof-of-principle study evaluates the Lysis-Filtration Method for identification as well as antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacteria directly from positive blood culture bottles in a clinical setting. A total of 100 non-duplicated positive blood cultures were tested and 1012 microorganism-antimicrobial combinations were assessed. An aliquot of non-charcoal blood culture broth was incubated with lysis buffer briefly before being filtered and washed. Microorganisms recovered from the filter membrane were first identified by using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight VITEK® Mass Spectrometry (VITEK MS). After quick identification from VITEK MS, filtered microorganisms were inoculated to VITEK®2 system for full panel antimicrobial susceptibility testing analysis. Of 100 bottles tested, the VITEK MS resulted in 94.0% correct organism identification to the species level. Compared to the conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods, direct antimicrobial susceptibility testing from VITEK®2 resulted in 93.5% (946/1012) category agreement of antimicrobials tested, with 3.6% (36/1012) minor error, 1.7% (7/1012) major error, and 1.3% (13/1012) very major error of antimicrobials. The average time to identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was 11.4 hours by using the Lysis-Filtration method for both VITEK MS and VITEK®2 compared to 56.3 hours by using conventional methods (p<0.00001). Thus, the same-day results of microorganism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing directly from positive blood culture can be achieved and can be used for appropriate antibiotic therapy and antibiotic stewardship."
https://openalex.org/W1992714945,"Why do people help strangers when there is a low probability that help will be directly reciprocated or socially rewarded? A possible explanation is that these acts are contagious: those who receive or observe help from a stranger become more likely to help others. We test two mechanisms for the social contagion of generosity among strangers: generalized reciprocity (a recipient of generosity is more likely to pay it forward) and third-party influence (an observer of generous behavior is more likely to emulate it). We use an online experiment with randomized trials to test the two hypothesized mechanisms and their interaction by manipulating the extent to which participants receive and observe help. Results show that receiving help can increase the willingness to be generous towards others, but observing help can have the opposite effect, especially among those who have not received help. These results suggest that observing widespread generosity may attenuate the belief that one’s own efforts are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2012614799,"Background The early life course is assumed to be a critical phase for childhood obesity; however the significance of single factors and their interplay is not well studied in childhood populations. Objectives The investigation of pre-, peri- and postpartum risk factors on the risk of obesity at age 2 to 9. Methods A case-control study with 1,024 1∶1-matched case-control pairs was nested in the baseline survey (09/2007–05/2008) of the IDEFICS study, a population-based intervention study on childhood obesity carried out in 8 European countries in pre- and primary school settings. Conditional logistic regression was used for identification of risk factors. Results For many of the investigated risk factors, we found a raw effect in our study. In multivariate models, we could establish an effect for gestational weight gain (adjusted OR = 1.02; 95%CI 1.00–1.04), smoking during pregnancy (adjusted OR = 1.48; 95%CI 1.08–2.01), Caesarian section (adjusted OR = 1.38; 95%CI 1.10–1.74), and breastfeeding 4 to 11 months (adjusted OR = 0.77; 95%CI 0.62–0.96). Birth weight was related to lean mass rather than to fat mass, the effect of smoking was found only in boys, but not in girls. After additional adjustment for parental BMI and parental educational status, only gestational weight gain remained statistically significant. Both, maternal as well as paternal BMI were the strongest risk factors in our study, and they confounded several of the investigated associations. Conclusions Key risk factors of childhood obesity in our study are parental BMI and gestational weight gain; consequently prevention approaches should target not only children but also adults. The monitoring of gestational weight seems to be of particular importance for early prevention of childhood obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1983017314,"We previously demonstrated that cinnamon extract (CE) ameliorates type 1 diabetes induced by streptozotocin in rats through the up-regulation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation in both muscle and adipose tissues. This present study was aimed at clarifying the detailed mechanism(s) with which CE increases the glucose uptake in vivo and in cell culture systems using 3T3-L1 adipocytes and C2C12 myotubes in vitro. Specific inhibitors of key enzymes in insulin signaling and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways, as well as small interference RNA, were used to examine the role of these kinases in the CE-induced glucose uptake. The results showed that CE stimulated the phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. An AMPK inhibitor and LKB1 siRNA blocked the CE-induced glucose uptake. We also found for the first time that insulin suppressed AMPK activation in the adipocyte. To investigate the effect of CE on type 2 diabetes in vivo, we further performed oral glucose tolerance tests and insulin tolerance tests in type 2 diabetes model rats administered with CE. The CE improved glucose tolerance in oral glucose tolerance tests, but not insulin sensitivity in insulin tolerance test. In summary, these results indicate that CE ameliorates type 2 diabetes by inducing GLUT4 translocation via the AMPK signaling pathway. We also found insulin antagonistically regulates the activation of AMPK."
https://openalex.org/W1998594088,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) impedes entry of many drugs into the brain, limiting clinical efficacy. A safe and efficient method for reversibly increasing BBB permeability would greatly facilitate central nervous system (CNS) drug delivery and expand the range of possible therapeutics to include water soluble compounds, proteins, nucleotides, and other large molecules. We examined the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on BBB permeability in Kunming (KM) mice. Human VEGF165 was administered to treatment groups at two concentrations (1.6 or 3.0 µg/mouse), while controls received equal-volume saline. Changes in BBB permeability were measured by parenchymal accumulation of the contrast agent Gd-DTPA as assessed by 7 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Mice were then injected with Evans blue, sacrificed 0.5 h later, and perfused transcardially. Brains were removed, fixed, and sectioned for histological study. Both VEGF groups exhibited a significantly greater signal intensity from the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia than controls (P<0.001). Evans blue fluorescence intensity was higher in the parenchyma and lower in the cerebrovasculature of VEGF-treated animals compared to controls. No significant brain edema was observed by diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) or histological staining. Exogenous application of VEGF can increase the permeability of the BBB without causing brain edema. Pretreatment with VEGF may be a feasible method to facilitate drug delivery into the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W1966527337,"Recently, spatio-temporal filtering to enhance decoding for Brain-Computer-Interfacing (BCI) has become increasingly popular. In this work, we discuss a novel, fully Bayesian-and thereby probabilistic-framework, called Bayesian Spatio-Spectral Filter Optimization (BSSFO) and apply it to a large data set of 80 non-invasive EEG-based BCI experiments. Across the full frequency range, the BSSFO framework allows to analyze which spatio-spectral parameters are common and which ones differ across the subject population. As expected, large variability of brain rhythms is observed between subjects. We have clustered subjects according to similarities in their corresponding spectral characteristics from the BSSFO model, which is found to reflect their BCI performances well. In BCI, a considerable percentage of subjects is unable to use a BCI for communication, due to their missing ability to modulate their brain rhythms-a phenomenon sometimes denoted as BCI-illiteracy or inability. Predicting individual subjects' performance preceding the actual, time-consuming BCI-experiment enhances the usage of BCIs, e.g., by detecting users with BCI inability. This work additionally contributes by using the novel BSSFO method to predict the BCI-performance using only 2 minutes and 3 channels of resting-state EEG data recorded before the actual BCI-experiment. Specifically, by grouping the individual frequency characteristics we have nicely classified them into the subject 'prototypes' (like μ - or β -rhythm type subjects) or users without ability to communicate with a BCI, and then by further building a linear regression model based on the grouping we could predict subjects' performance with the maximum correlation coefficient of 0.581 with the performance later seen in the actual BCI session."
https://openalex.org/W1979952143,"We have previously shown that in successful pregnancies increased arginase activity is a mechanism that contributes to the suppression of the maternal immune system. We identified the main type of arginase-expressing cells as a population of activated low-density granulocytes (LDGs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in term placentae. In the present study, we analyzed the phenotype of LDGs and compared it to the phenotype of normal density granulocytes (NDGs) in maternal peripheral blood, placental biopsies and cord blood. Our data reveal that only LDGs but no NDGs could be detected in placental biopsies. Phenotypically, NDGs and LDGs from both maternal and cord blood expressed different levels of maturation, activation and degranulation markers. NDGs from the maternal and cord blood were phenotypically similar, while maternal, cord and placental LDGs showed different expression levels of CD66b. LDGs present in cord blood expressed higher levels of arginase compared to maternal and placental LDGs. In summary, our results show that in maternal and cord blood, two phenotypically different populations of neutrophils can be identified, whereas in term placentae, only activated neutrophils are present."
https://openalex.org/W2113834894,"The human TERT (hTERT) gene encodes the telomerase catalytic subunit which plays a role in telomerase regulation. Telomerase is activated in more than 90% of all human malignancies and understanding how telomerase is regulated is necessary for implementation of successful anti-cancer therapies. microRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression in eukaryotic cells but evidence of their role in telomerase regulation has not been documented. To determine whether hTERT activity is regulated by multiple miRNAs, eight miRNAs which have putative binding sites in the hTERT 3′UTR together with miR-138-5p were evaluated in luciferase assays with a reporter containing the hTERT 3′UTR. Six miRNAs (let-7g*, miR-133a, miR-138-5p, miR-342-5p, miR-491-5p, and miR-541-3p) specifically inhibited the expression of the reporter luciferase-driven constructs and let-7g*, miR-133a, miR-138-5p, and miR-491-5p also downregulated endogenous telomerase activity in cells. Moreover, all six miRNAs significantly inhibited cell proliferation. miRNAs (miR-133a, miR-138-5p, 342-5p, 491-5p, 541-3p) also have predicted binding sites within the 3′UTR of three genes involved in Wnt signaling (TCF7, MSI1, and PAX5). These miRNAs inhibited the expression of the luciferase reporter constructs containing 3′UTRs of these genes and downregulated protein expression of the TCF7 transcription factor, which mediates the canonical Wnt pathway. Together, these results suggest the existence of a miRNA regulatory network involving the hTERT and Wnt pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1996249512,"Sizable pools of freely circulating glycosyltransferases are in blood, but understanding their physiologic contributions has been hampered because functional sources of sugar donor substrates needed to drive extracellular glycosylation have not been identified. The blood-borne ST6Gal-1 produced and secreted by the liver is the most noted among the circulatory glycosyltransferases, and decorates marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells with α2,6-linked sialic acids and restricts blood cell production. Platelets, upon activation, secrete a plethora of bioactive molecules including pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. Cargos of sugar donor substrates for glycosyltransferase activity have also been reported in platelets. Here, we implemented a cell-based system to interrogate platelets for their ability to deliver effectively the sugar donor substrate for extracellular ST6Gal-1 to function. We report that thrombin-activated platelets, at physiologic concentration and pH, can efficiently and effectively substitute for CMP-sialic acid in extracellular ST6Gal-1-mediated sialylation of target cell surfaces. Activated platelets can also supply the sialic acid donor to sialylate the synthetic acceptor, Gal(β1,4)GlcNAcα-o-benzyl, with the product Sia(α2,6)Gal(β1,4)GlcNAcα-o-benzyl structurally confirmed by LC/MS. Platelet-secreted donor substrate was recovered in the 100,000 × g sediment, strongly suggesting the association of this otherwise soluble substrate, putatively CMP-sialic acid, within platelet microparticles. Sequestration within microparticles may facilitate delivery of glycosylation substrate at effective dosages to sites of extracellular glycosylation while minimizing excessive dilution."
https://openalex.org/W2014594219,"The highly sialylated vascular endothelial surface undergoes changes in sialylation upon adopting the migratory/angiogenic phenotype. We recently established endothelial cell (EC) expression of NEU1 sialidase (Cross, A. S., Hyun, S. W., Miranda-Ribera, A., Feng, C., Liu, A., Nguyen, C., Zhang, L., Luzina, I. G., Atamas, S. P., Twaddell, W. S., Guang, W., Lillehoj, E. P., Puché, A. C., Huang, W., Wang, L. X., Passaniti, A., and Goldblum, S. E. (2012) NEU1 and NEU3 sialidase activity expressed in human lung microvascular endothelia. NEU1 restrains endothelial cell migration whereas NEU3 does not. J. Biol. Chem. 287, 15966-15980). We asked whether NEU1 might regulate EC capillary-like tube formation on a Matrigel substrate. In human pulmonary microvascular ECs (HPMECs), prior silencing of NEU1 did not alter tube formation. Infection of HPMECs with increasing multiplicities of infection of an adenovirus encoding for catalytically active WT NEU1 dose-dependently impaired tube formation, whereas overexpression of either a catalytically dead NEU1 mutant, NEU1-G68V, or another human sialidase, NEU3, did not. NEU1 overexpression also diminished EC adhesion to the Matrigel substrate and restrained EC migration in a wounding assay. In HPMECs, the adhesion molecule, CD31, also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, was sialylated via α2,6-linkages, as shown by Sambucus nigra agglutinin lectin blotting. NEU1 overexpression increased CD31 binding to Arachis hypogaea or peanut agglutinin lectin, indicating CD31 desialylation. In the postconfluent state, when CD31 ectodomains are homophilically engaged, NEU1 was recruited to and desialylated CD31. In postconfluent ECs, CD31 was desialylated compared with subconfluent cells, and prior NEU1 silencing completely protected against CD31 desialylation. Prior CD31 silencing and the use of CD31-null ECs each abrogated the NEU1 inhibitory effect on EC tube formation. Sialyltransferase 6 GAL-I overexpression increased α2,6-linked CD31 sialylation and dose-dependently counteracted NEU1-mediated inhibition of EC tube formation. These combined data indicate that catalytically active NEU1 inhibits in vitro angiogenesis through desialylation of its substrate, CD31."
https://openalex.org/W2001322210,"The clinical notes in a given patient record contain much redundancy, in large part due to clinicians’ documentation habit of copying from previous notes in the record and pasting into a new note. Previous work has shown that this redundancy has a negative impact on the quality of text mining and topic modeling in particular. In this paper we describe a novel variant of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, Red-LDA, which takes into account the inherent redundancy of patient records when modeling content of clinical notes. To assess the value of Red-LDA, we experiment with three baselines and our novel redundancy-aware topic modeling method: given a large collection of patient records, (i) apply vanilla LDA to all documents in all input records; (ii) identify and remove all redundancy by chosing a single representative document for each record as input to LDA; (iii) identify and remove all redundant paragraphs in each record, leaving partial, non-redundant documents as input to LDA; and (iv) apply Red-LDA to all documents in all input records. Both quantitative evaluation carried out through log-likelihood on held-out data and topic coherence of produced topics and qualitative assessement of topics carried out by physicians show that Red-LDA produces superior models to all three baseline strategies. This research contributes to the emerging field of understanding the characteristics of the electronic health record and how to account for them in the framework of data mining. The code for the two redundancy-elimination baselines and Red-LDA is made publicly available to the community."
https://openalex.org/W2060356473,"Nonlinear dependence is general in regulation mechanism of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). It is vital to properly measure or test nonlinear dependence from real data for reconstructing GRNs and understanding the complex regulatory mechanisms within the cellular system. A recently developed measurement called the distance correlation (DC) has been shown powerful and computationally effective in nonlinear dependence for many situations. In this work, we incorporate the DC into inferring GRNs from the gene expression data without any underling distribution assumptions. We propose three DC-based GRNs inference algorithms: CLR-DC, MRNET-DC and REL-DC, and then compare them with the mutual information (MI)-based algorithms by analyzing two simulated data: benchmark GRNs from the DREAM challenge and GRNs generated by SynTReN network generator, and an experimentally determined SOS DNA repair network in Escherichia coli. According to both the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve and the precision-recall (PR) curve, our proposed algorithms significantly outperform the MI-based algorithms in GRNs inference."
https://openalex.org/W2005980333,"The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a widespread machine used by bacteria to control their environment and kill or disable bacterial species or eukaryotes through toxin injection. The T6SS comprises a central tube formed of stacked hexamers of hemolysin co-regulated proteins (Hcp) and terminated by a trimeric valine-glycine repeat protein G (VgrG) component, the cell puncturing device. A contractile tail sheath, formed by the TssB and TssC proteins, surrounds this tube. This syringe-like machine has been compared to an inverted phage, as both Hcp and VgrG share structural homology with tail components of Caudovirales. Here we solved the crystal structure of a tryptophan-substituted double mutant of Hcp1 from enteroaggregative Escherichia coli and compared it to the structures of other Hcps. Interestingly, we observed that the purified Hcp native protein is unable to form tubes in vitro. To better understand the rationale for observation, we measured the affinity of Hcp1 hexamers with themselves by surface plasmon resonance. The intra-hexamer interaction is weak, with a KD value of 7.2 µM. However, by engineering double cysteine mutants at defined positions, tubes of Hcp1 gathering up to 15 stacked hexamers formed in oxidative conditions. These results, together with those available in the literature regarding TssB and TssC, suggest that assembly of the T6SS tube differs significantly from that of Sipho- or Myoviridae."

The Crotalus adamanteus toxin-II (CaTx-II) induced bactericidal effects (7.8 µg/ml) on Staphylococcus aureus, while on Burkholderia pseudomallei (KHW), and Enterobacter aerogenes were killed at 15.6 µg/ml. CaTx-II caused pore formation and membrane damaging effects on the bacterial cell wall. CaTx-II was not cytotoxic on lung (MRC-5), skin fibroblast (HEPK) cells and in mice. CaTx-II-treated mice showed significant wound closure and complete healing by 16 days as compared to untreated controls (**P<0.01). Histological examination revealed enhanced collagen synthesis and neovascularization after treatment with CaTx-II versus 2% Fusidic Acid ointment (FAO) treated controls. Measurement of tissue cytokines revealed that interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) expression in CaTx-II treated mice was significantly suppressed versus untreated controls. In contrast, cytokines involved in wound healing and cell migration i.e., monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), fibroblast growth factor-basic (FGF-b), chemokine (KC), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were significantly enhanced in CaTx-II treated mice, but not in the controls. CaTx-II also modulated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation during skin wound healing. The CaTx-II protein highlights distinct snake proteins as a potential source of novel antimicrobial agents with significant therapeutic application for bacterial skin infections."
https://openalex.org/W2007584456,"In this study, a new apoptotic monoterpenoid indole alkaloid, subditine (1), and four known compounds were isolated from the bark of Nauclea subdita. Complete 1H- and 13C- NMR data of the new compound were reported. The structures of isolated compounds were elucidated with various spectroscopic methods such as 1D- and 2D- NMR, IR, UV and LCMS. All five compounds were screened for cytotoxic activities on LNCaP and PC-3 human prostate cancer cell-lines. Among the five compounds, the new alkaloid, subditine (1), demonstrated the most potent cell growth inhibition activity and selective against LNCaP with an IC50 of 12.24±0.19 µM and PC-3 with an IC50 of 13.97±0.32 µM, compared to RWPE human normal epithelial cell line (IC50 = 30.48±0.08 µM). Subditine (1) treatment induced apoptosis in LNCaP and PC-3 as evidenced by increased cell permeability, disruption of cytoskeletal structures and increased nuclear fragmentation. In addition, subditine (1) enhanced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, as reflected by increased expression of glutathione reductase (GR) to scavenge damaging free radicals in both prostate cancer cell-lines. Excessive ROS could lead to disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), release of cytochrome c and subsequent caspase 9, 3/7 activation. Further Western blot analyses showed subditine (1) induced down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl expression, whereas p53 was up-regulated in LNCaP (p53-wild-type), but not in PC-3 (p53-null). Overall, our data demonstrated that the new compound subditine (1) exerts anti-proliferative effect on LNCaP and PC-3 human prostate cancer cells through induction of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2141253335,"CD47 is a widely distributed membrane protein that interacts with signal-regulatory protein α (SIRPα), an inhibitory receptor on myeloid cells that gives a ""don't-eat-me"" signal. Manipulation of the interaction is of considerable interest in the immunotherapy of cancer and in xenotransplantation. The amino-terminal ligand binding domain of SIRPα is highly polymorphic in contrast to the single Ig-like domain of CD47. There is confusion as to whether the polymorphisms will affect ligand binding, but this is an important point for this interaction and other paired receptors being considered as targets for therapy. We show by x-ray crystallography that one human SIRPα allele differing in 13 amino acid residues has a very similar binding site and that several different alleles all bind CD47 with similar affinity as expected because the residues are mostly surface-exposed and distant from the binding site. A peptide from the binding site of CD47 has been reported to mimic the CD47 interaction with SIRPα, but we could find no binding. We discuss the possible pitfalls in determining the affinity of weak interactions and also speculate on how SIRPα polymorphisms may have been selected by pathogens and how this may also be true in other paired receptors such as the KIRs."
https://openalex.org/W2032942014,"MicroRNAs, or miRNAs, are endogenously encoded small RNAs that play a key role in diverse plant biological processes. Jatropha curcas L. has received significant attention as a potential oilseed crop for the production of renewable oil. Here, a sRNA library of mature seeds and three mRNA libraries from three different seed development stages were generated by deep sequencing to identify and characterize the miRNAs and pre-miRNAs of J. curcas. Computational analysis was used for the identification of 180 conserved miRNAs and 41 precursors (pre-miRNAs) as well as 16 novel pre-miRNAs. The predicted miRNA target genes are involved in a broad range of physiological functions, including cellular structure, nuclear function, translation, transport, hormone synthesis, defense, and lipid metabolism. Some pre-miRNA and miRNA targets vary in abundance between the three stages of seed development. A search for sequences that produce siRNA was performed, and the results indicated that J. curcas siRNAs play a role in nuclear functions, transport, catalytic processes and disease resistance. This study presents the first large scale identification of J. curcas miRNAs and their targets in mature seeds based on deep sequencing, and it contributes to a functional understanding of these miRNAs."

IQGAP1 interacts with several signaling proteins, cytoskeletal components, and transmembrane receptors, thereby serving as a scaffold to integrate signaling pathways. Both ERα and IQGAP1 contribute to breast cancer. In this study, we report that IQGAP1 binds ERα and ERβ. In vitro analysis with pure proteins revealed a direct interaction between IQGAP1 and ERα. Investigation with multiple short fragments of each protein showed that ERα binds to the IQ domain of IQGAP1, whereas the hinge region of ERα is responsible for binding IQGAP1. In addition, IQGAP1 and ERα co-immunoprecipitated from cells, and the association was modulated by estradiol. The interaction has functional effects. Knockdown of endogenous IQGAP1 attenuated the ability of estradiol to induce transcription of the estrogen-responsive genes pS2, progesterone receptor, and cyclin D1.

Investigation with multiple short fragments of each protein showed that ERα binds to the IQ domain of IQGAP1, whereas the hinge region of ERα is responsible for binding IQGAP1. In addition, IQGAP1 and ERα co-immunoprecipitated from cells, and the association was modulated by estradiol. The interaction has functional effects. Knockdown of endogenous IQGAP1 attenuated the ability of estradiol to induce transcription of the estrogen-responsive genes pS2, progesterone receptor, and cyclin D1. These data reveal that IQGAP1 binds to ERα and modulates its transcriptional function, suggesting that IQGAP1 might be a target for therapy in patients with breast carcinoma. The estrogen receptor (ER) 3The abbreviations used are: ERestrogen receptorE217β-estradiolPRprogesterone receptorhnRNAheterogenous nuclear RNADBDDNA-binding domainNFATnuclear factor of activated T cellsNrf2nuclear factor-erythroid-related factor 2TnTtranscription and translation. participates in a diverse range of biological functions, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and differentiation (1.Thomas C. Gustafsson J.Å. The different roles of ER subtypes in cancer biology and therapy.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Humans have two isoforms of ER, termed α and β, which are expressed from different genes (2.Heldring N. Pike A. Andersson S. Matthews J. Cheng G. Hartman J. Tujague M. Ström A. Treuter E. Warner M. Gustafsson J.A. Estrogen receptors: how do they signal and what are their targets.Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 905-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). ERα and ERβ contain analogous structural and functional domains, including the ligand-independent transcriptional activation function-1 located in regions A and B, a DNA-binding domain (DBD) in region C, a hinge region (region D), and hormone-binding domain/ligand-dependent activation function-2 (region E). Notwithstanding these similarities, the receptors differ in both their tissue distribution and functions (1.Thomas C. Gustafsson J.Å. The different roles of ER subtypes in cancer biology and therapy.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 2.Heldring N. Pike A. Andersson S. Matthews J.

Rev. 2007; 87: 905-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). 17β-Estradiol (E2) binding to the ligand-binding domain of ERα can produce distinct effects in the target cells by stimulating two pathways. These are the “classic” pathway in the nucleus that enhances gene transcription and extranuclear actions that are initiated from ERα in the plasma membrane and result in rapid actions of E2 by activating signaling pathways (3.Levin E.R. Membrane oestrogen receptor α signalling to cell functions.J. Physiol. 2009; 587: 5019-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the classic pathway, E2 induces a change in ERα conformation, resulting in dimerization of the receptor. In the nucleus, the E2-ERα complex binds either directly to estrogen response elements in the promoters of target genes or indirectly through protein-protein interactions with other transcription factor complexes like Fos-Jun (activator protein-1 response elements) and influences transcription of genes that lack estrogen response elements (2.Heldring N. Pike A. Andersson S. Matthews J. Cheng G. Hartman J. Tujague M. Ström A. Treuter E. Warner M. Gustafsson J.A. Estrogen receptors: how do they signal and what are their targets.Physiol.

Multiple ERα target genes have been identified, including activator protein-1 (5.Philips A. Chalbos D. Rochefort H.

Distinct co-regulatory proteins are recruited to ERα and modulate ERα function by serving as co-repressors or co-activators (2.Heldring N. Pike A. Andersson S. Matthews J. Cheng G. Hartman J.

Rev. 2007; 87: 905-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence reveals that ERα associates with interconnected networks of proteins that maintain the structure and function of the receptor and influence estrogen-responsive gene expression (9.Schultz-Norton J.R. Ziegler Y.S. Nardulli A.M. ERα-associated protein networks.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2011; 22: 124-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). One of the proteins that interact with ERα is the Ca2+ signaling protein calmodulin. Prior work from our laboratory characterized the interaction between ERα and calmodulin. We demonstrated that calmodulin binds directly to ERα in a Ca2+-regulated manner (10.Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. Calmodulin enhances the stability of the estrogen receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Calmodulin binding promotes the stability of ERα by sequestering it away from the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (11.Li L. Li Z. Howley P.M. Sacks D.B. E6AP and calmodulin reciprocally regulate estrogen receptor stability.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1978-1985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Interestingly, calmodulin is also necessary for E2-stimulated transcriptional activation of ERα (12.Li L. Li Z. Sacks D.B.

Thus, specific cellular proteins can influence ERα degradation and transcriptional activity. IQGAP1 is a ubiquitously expressed scaffold protein that associates with a wide repertoire of binding partners. Almost 100 proteins have been identified that interact with IQGAP1 either directly or in a multiprotein complex (13.Brown M.D. Sacks D.B.

IQGAP1, a novel vascular endothelial growth factor receptor binding protein, is involved in reactive oxygen species-dependent endothelial migration and proliferation.Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). ERα target gene expression results from the coordinated action of ERα and its co-regulators (4.Manavathi B. Dey O. Gajulapalli V.N. Bhatia R.S. Bugide S. Kumar R. Derailed estrogen signaling and breast cancer: an authentic couple.Endocr. Rev. 2013; 34: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Most of these co-regulatory proteins contain an LXXLL motif (L, leucine; X, any amino acid) that interacts with the ligand-binding domain of ERα (20.Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. A signature motif in transcriptional co-activators mediates binding to nuclear receptors.Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). Inspection of the amino acid sequence of human IQGAP1 revealed three LXXLL motifs, raising the possibility that IQGAP1 might bind ERα. In this study, we demonstrated that IQGAP1 and ERα associate in vitro and co-immunoprecipitate from cells. Binding was regulated by E2, and the ability of E2 to induce transcriptional activation was impaired in cells in which IQGAP1 was specifically knocked down by siRNA. MCF-7, T47D, and HEK293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. All reagents for tissue culture were bought from Invitrogen. Protein A-Sepharose and glutathione-Sepharose were purchased from GE Healthcare. Anti-FLAG affinity gel was from Sigma-Aldrich. PVDF membranes were purchased from Millipore Corp. Anti-ERα polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, anti-ERβ polyclonal antibodies, anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, rabbit IgG, and mouse IgG were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

To generate ERα deletion constructs, amino acids were deleted from myc-tagged ERα using primers 5′-CGGCTCCGCAAATGCTACGAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTAGCGAGTCTCCTTGGCAG-3 (reverse) for deletion of amino acids 185–240 (ERαΔ185–240), 5′-ACGGCCGACCAGATGGTCAGTGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCAGGCCTGGCAGCTCTTCC-3′ (reverse) for deletion of amino acids 240–311 (ERαΔ240–311), 5′-AGAGATGATGGGGAGGGCAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCAGGCCTGGCAGCAGCTCTTCC-3′ (reverse) for deletion of amino acids 240–270 (ERαΔ240–270), and 5′-ACGGCCGACCAGATGGTCAGTGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCGCTTGTGTTTCAACATTCTCCC-3 (reverse) for deletion of amino acids 270–311 (ERαΔ270–311). To construct GST-ERα, PCR was performed using pcDNA3-myc-ERα as a template with 5′-CGGGATCCACCATGACCCTCCACACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGGGCCCTCAGACTGTGGCAGGGAAACC-3′ (reverse) primers. The product was digested with BamHI and inserted into pGEX4T-TEV at BamHI and SmaI sites. The sequences of all plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids were purified with a QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen). GST-IQGAP1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and isolated using glutathione-Sepharose chromatography essentially as described previously (21.Ho Y.D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. IQGAP1 integrates Ca2+/calmodulin and Cdc42 signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Where indicated, IQGAP1 was further purified by cleaving GST using tobacco etch virus (22.Ren J.G. Li Z. Crimmins D.L. Sacks D.B. Self-association of IQGAP1: characterization and functional sequelae.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34548-34557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). GST-ERα was expressed and isolated as described for GST-IQGAP1. The size and purity of the GST proteins were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. All proteins were at least 90% pure. Purified untagged IQGAP1 (1 μg) was incubated with 4 μg of GST alone or 4 μg of GST-ERα on glutathione-Sepharose beads in 500 μl of Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Scientific) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (Buffer B) for 3 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads five times with Buffer A, samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was cut at the 100-kDa region. The top part of the gel was transferred to PVDF, blocked with Blocking Buffer (LI-COR Biosciences) for 1 h at 22 °C, and then probed with anti-IQGAP1 polyclonal antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was incubated with IRDye-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody for 1 h, and antigen-antibody complexes were detected using the Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). The lower portion of the gel containing GST and GST-ERα was stained with Coomassie Blue. For GST-IQGAP1 pulldown, recombinant human ERα (1 μg) was incubated with 1 μg of GST or 1 μg of GST-IQGAP1 on glutathione-Sepharose beads in Buffer B for 3 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads five times with Buffer A, samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was cut at both the 37- and 100-kDa regions. The top and bottom portions of the gel containing GST-IQGAP1 and GST, respectively, were stained with Coomassie Blue. The middle portion of the gel was transferred to PVDF and processed for Western blotting with anti-ERα monoclonal antibody and IRDye-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. GST-IQGAP1 pulldown of recombinant human ERβ was performed essentially as described for ERα except that the blots were probed with anti-ERβ antibody. HEK293 and MCF-7 cells were maintained in DMEM, and T47D cells were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium. Both media were supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. HEK293 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transient overexpression of IQGAP1 increased the amount of the protein in cell lysates by 1.95 ± 0.23-fold (mean ± S.E., n = 5). MCF-7 and T47D cells were plated in 10-cm dishes. When they reached 90% confluence, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (155.6 mm NaCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, and 2.9 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) and lysed with 500 μl of Buffer B. Lysates were processed by sonication for 10 s with a Model 100 Dismembrator (Fischer Scientific), and insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min. The resultant supernatants were precleared by incubating with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein lysate were incubated with 4 μg of GST, GST-ERα, or GST-IQGAP1 for 3 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, samples were washed five times with Buffer A and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was cut at the 100- and 37-kDa regions. For GST-IQGAP1 pulldown, the top and bottom portions containing GST-IQGAP1 and GST proteins, respectively, were stained with Coomassie Blue. The middle part of the gel was transferred to PVDF. For GST-ERα pulldown, the gel was cut at 100 kDa. The bottom portion of the gel was stained with Coomassie, and the top portion was transferred to PVDF. After transferring to PVDF, samples were processed by Western blotting. [35S]Methionine-labeled TnT products were synthesized using the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega) essentially as described previously (16.White C.D. Li Z. Dillon D.A.

Briefly, 1 μg each of pcDNA3-IQGAP1, IQGAP1-N, IQGAP1-C, IQGAP1-IQ, IQGAP1ΔIQ, ERα, ERα(2–270), ERα(180–595), ERα(300–595), ERα(180–353), ERαΔ185–240, ERαΔ240–311, ERαΔ240–270, ERαΔ270–311, or ERβ was incubated with 40 μl of TnT Quick Master Mix and 20 μCi of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 90 min at 30 °C. TnT products were diluted in Buffer A and used in pulldown assays. To obtain a control plasmid for knockdown experiments, siRNA sequences of Renilla luciferase, 5-AAACAUGCAGAAAAUGCUG-3 (sense) and 5-CAGCAUUUUCUGCAUGUUU-3 (antisense), were inserted into the pRETRO-SUPER vector (OligoEngine) and named pRETRO-SUPER-siRenilla. To generate retroviruses, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with pUVMC, pCMV-VSV-G (Addgene plasmids 8454 and 8449, respectively, deposited by Robert Weinberg) (24.Stewart S.A. Dykxhoorn D.M.

MCF-7 cell lines were infected with retrovirus essentially as described previously (25.Mataraza J.M. Briggs M.W. Li Z. Entwistle A. Ridley A.J. Sacks D.B.

To produce MCF-siIQ15, IQGAP1 siRNA (human) lentiviral particles (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-35700) were used. This siRNA is a pool of three different siRNA duplexes as 5-CCACAGUGAUCUUGCUGAA-3 (sense), 5-UUCAGCAAGAUCACUGUGGtt-3 (antisense) (sc-35700A), 5-GGAUGAAUUUCCUGAAGAA-3 (sense), 5-UUCUUCAGGAAAUUCAUCCtt-3 (antisense) (sc-35700B), 5-CCACAAAGAUGAAGUUGUA-3 (sense), and 5-UACAACUUCAUCUUUGUGG-3 (antisense) (sc-35700C). MCF-7 cells were infected with the siRNA pool according to the manufacturer's instructions. Puromycin (Invitrogen) selection was used to obtain MCF-7 cells stably expressing the different siRNAs. The MCF-7 cell lines infected with pRETRO-SUPER-IQ8 and with siRNA lentiviral particles (sc-35700) are named MCF-siIQ8 (25.Mataraza J.M. Briggs M.W. Li Z. Entwistle A. Ridley A.J. Sacks D.B.

The expression levels of IQGAP1 were assessed by Western blotting. HEK293 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes to obtain 80% confluence. After 24 h, each plate was transfected with 5 μg of myc-tagged IQGAP1 and either 5 μg of myc-tagged ERα or FLAG-tagged ERβ plasmids. The following day, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 500 μl of Buffer B. Lysates were subjected to sonication for 10 s, and insoluble material was precipitated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were precleared with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h. Equal amounts of protein lysate were incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads and either rabbit IgG, anti-IQGAP1 polyclonal antibodies, anti-ERα polyclonal antibodies, or anti-FLAG affinity gel for 3 h at 4 °C. Samples were washed five times with Buffer A, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and processed by Western blotting. Paraformaldehyde cross-linking was performed using a modification of a procedure described previously (26.Vasilescu J. Guo X. Kast J. Identification of protein-protein interactions using in vivo cross-linking and mass spectrometry.Proteomics. 2004; 4: 3845-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). MCF-7 and T47D cells were grown to 90% confluence and incubated in 1 ml of 0.2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 or 20 min at 22 °C. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by adding 1.25 m glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm. After 5 min, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with Buffer B. Cell lysates were processed by immunoprecipitation with rabbit IgG or anti-ERα polyclonal antibodies using the protocol described above. HEK293 cells were cultured in phenol red-free medium with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS. After 24 h, cells were transfected with both IQGAP1 and ERα plasmids as described above. The following day, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 100 nm E2 or vehicle (ethanol). After 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 120 min or 360 min, E2 stimulation was stopped by washing cells with PBS and lysing them with Buffer B. Immunoprecipitation with anti-IQGAP1 polyclonal antibodies and Western blotting were performed as described above. To measure pS2 hnRNA, MCF-7 cells were incubated in phenol red-free medium for 24 h. Then vehicle (EtOH) or E2 (to obtain a final concentration of 100 nm) was added to the medium. After 6 h, cells were harvested, and total RNA was isolated from the cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen). 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcriptase kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed on a StepOnePlus Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 200 nm forward and reverse primers. The primers used were: pS2 hnRNA, forward primer, 5-TTGGAGAAGGAAGCTGGATGG-3 (start position 3997, within the intron); reverse primer, 5-ACCACAATTCTGTCTTTCACGG-3 (start position 4126, within the second exon); and β-actin, forward primer, 5-TGCGTGACATTAAGGAGAAG-3; reverse primer, 5-GCTCGTAGCTCTTCTCCA-3. RT-PCR enzyme activation was initiated for 10 min at 95 °C and then amplified by 40 cycles (15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C). All samples were assayed in triplicate, and β-actin was used as an internal control. Results were analyzed using the ΔΔCT method with StepOnePlus software (Applied Biosystems). Measurement of PR and cyclin D1 hnRNA was performed as described for pS2 with the following modifications. MCF-7 cells were incubated in phenol red-free medium for 72 h. Vehicle (EtOH) or E2 (final concentration of 10 nm) was added to the medium for 4 h after which cells were harvested and processed as described in the preceding paragraph.

Briefly, MCF-siIQ8, MCF-siIQ15, and MCF-7 cells expressing control siRNA were plated in 96-well, flat bottom tissue culture plates. After incubating for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the medium was changed to phenol red-free DMEM. E2 (final concentration of 50 nm) or an equal volume of EtOH (vehicle) was added, and cells were incubated for another 72 h. Then 15 μl of Dye Solution (Promega 2015-09-14) was added, and the cells were incubated for 4 h. 100 μl of Solubilization/Stop Solution (Promega 2016-04-21) was added to each well, and the absorbances were determined at 570 nm using a SYNERGY4 multilabel counter (BioTek). The reference wavelength was 700 nm. All of the assays were performed in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test with Prism 6 (GraphPad). Western blot images were quantified with Image Studio 2.0 (LI-COR Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were determined with the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Analysis was performed in vitro with pure proteins to ascertain whether IQGAP1 and ERα interact. Pure ERα was incubated with a GST fusion protein of full-length IQGAP1, and complexes were isolated with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Western blotting showed that ERα bound to IQGAP1 (Fig. 1A). By contrast, no ERα binding was detected to GST alone, validating the specificity of the association with IQGAP1. The interaction was confirmed by pulldown with GST-ERα. IQGAP1 was cleaved from GST, and the purified protein was incubated with a GST fusion protein of full-length ERα. Complexes were isolated, and Western blotting was performed. IQGAP1 bound GST-ERα (Fig. 1B). No IQGAP1 was detected with GST alone. Coomassie staining showed the expression of GST-tagged IQGAP1 and ERα proteins (Fig. 1). To determine whether IQGAP1 and ERα interact in a normal cell milieu, we used cultured human breast epithelial cell lines that express ERα. MCF-7 cells were lysed and incubated with GST-IQGAP1. Endogenous ERα bound to GST-IQGAP1 (Fig. 2A, left panel). The specificity of binding was confirmed by the absence of ERα from the samples incubated with GST alone. Essentially identical results were obtained with a second ERα-containing human breast epithelial cell line, T47D (Fig. 2A, right panel). A reciprocal analysis was conduct"

https://openalex.org/W2025823998,"The dissemination of HIV from an initial site of infection is facilitated by motile HIV-infected CD4(+) T-cells. However, the impact of infected target cell migration on antigen recognition by HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cells is unclear. Using a 3D in vitro model of tissue, we visualized dynamic interactions between HIV-infected or peptide-pulsed CD4(+) T-cells and HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cells. CTLs engaged motile HIV-infected targets, but ∼ 50% of targets broke contact and escaped. In contrast, immobilized target cells were readily killed, indicating target motility directly inhibits CD8(+) T-cell function. Strong calcium signals occurred in CTLs killing a motile target but calcium signaling was weak or absent in CTLs which permitted target escape. Neutralization of adhesion receptors LFA-1 and CD58 inhibited CD8(+) T-cell function within the 3D matrix, demonstrating that efficient motile target lysis as dependent on adhesive engagement of targets. Antigen sensitivity (a convolution of antigen density, TCR avidity and CD8 coreceptor binding) is also critical for target recognition. We modulated this parameter (known as functional avidity but referred to here as ""avidity"" for the sake of simplicity) by exploiting common HIV escape mutations and measured their impact on CTL function at the single-cell level. Targets pulsed with low avidity mutant antigens frequently escaped while CTLs killed targets bearing high avidity antigen with near-perfect efficiency. CTLs engaged, arrested, and killed an initial target bearing high avidity antigen within minutes, but serial killing was surprisingly rare. CD8 cells remained committed to their initial dead target for hours, accumulating TCR signals that sustained secretion of soluble antiviral factors. These data indicate that high-avidity CD8(+) T-cells execute an antiviral program in the precise location where antigen has been sensed: CTL effector functions are spatiotemporally coordinated with an early lytic phase followed by a sustained stationary secretory phase to control local viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W2054587516,"Background Cellulitis (erysipelas) is a recurring and debilitating bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissue. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic treatment to prevent the recurrence of cellulitis using low dose penicillin V in patients following a first episode (6 months prophylaxis) and more recurrent cellulitis (12 months prophylaxis, or 6 months in those declining 12 months). Methods Within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using the findings of two randomised placebo-controlled multicentre trials (PATCH I and PATCH II), in which patients recruited in the UK and Ireland were followed-up for up to 3 years. Incremental cost, reduction in recurrence, cost per recurrence prevented and cost/QALY were estimated. National unit and reference costs for England in 2010 were applied to resource use, exploring NHS and societal perspectives. A total of 397 patients from the two trials contributed to the analysis. Results There was a 29% reduction in the number of recurrences occurring within the trial (IRR: 0.71 95%CI: 0.53 to 0.90, p = 0.02), corresponding to an absolute reduction of recurrence of 0.31 recurrences/patient (95%CI: 0.05 to 0.59, p = 0.02). Incremental costs of prophylaxis suggested a small cost saving but were not statistically significant, comparing the two groups. If a decision-maker is willing to pay up to £25,000/QALY then there is a 66% probability of antibiotic prophylaxis being cost-effective from an NHS perspective, rising to 76% probability from a secondary, societal perspective. Conclusion Following first episode or recurrent cellulitis of the leg, prophylactic low dose penicillin is a very low cost intervention which, on balance, is effective and cost-effective at preventing subsequent attacks. Antibiotic prophylaxis reduces cellulitis recurrence by nearly a third but is not associated with a significant increase in costs."
https://openalex.org/W2042911786,"Nearly all primary uveal melanoma (UM) that metastasize involve the liver. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is proposed to be an important microenvironmental element in attracting/supporting UM metastasis through activation of MET. The majority (>85%) of UM express mutations in the G-alpha proteins, that drive the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway. Thus, we proposed that the combination of MET and MEK inhibition would inhibit the growth and migration of G-alpha protein mutant versus non-mutant UM cells.Western-blots demonstrated the relative protein levels of ERK1/2 and MET in UM cells. Cells were treated with the small molecule inhibitors AZD6244 (MEKi) and/or MK-8033 (METi) and downstream markers evaluated. Further studies determined the effect of combination MEKi and METi treatment on cell growth, apoptosis and migration.All G-alpha protein mutant UM cell lines express MET mRNA and protein. The level of mRNA expression correlates with protein expression. MEKi, but not METi treatment results in markedly reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Either MEKi or METi treatment alone results in reduced cell proliferation, but only modest induction of apoptosis. The combination MEKi+METi results in significant reduction of proliferation in G-alpha protein mutant cells. UM cell migration was blocked by METi, but not MEKi treatment.MET protein expression showed no correlation with G-alpha protein mutation status. Combining MEKi with METi treatment has added benefit to either treatment alone in reducing G-alpha protein mutant UM cell growth. Combining METi with MEKi treatment adds the effect of limiting uveal melanoma cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2075546393,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) are two major types of joint diseases that share multiple common symptoms. However, their pathological mechanism remains largely unknown. The aim of our study is to identify RA and OA related-genes and gain an insight into the underlying genetic basis of these diseases.We collected 11 whole genome-wide expression profiling datasets from RA and OA cohorts and performed a meta-analysis to comprehensively investigate their expression signatures. This method can avoid some pitfalls of single dataset analyses.We found that several biological pathways (i.e., the immunity, inflammation and apoptosis related pathways) are commonly involved in the development of both RA and OA. Whereas several other pathways (i.e., vasopressin-related pathway, regulation of autophagy, endocytosis, calcium transport and endoplasmic reticulum stress related pathways) present significant difference between RA and OA. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease, thereby aiding the diagnosis and treatment of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2030730499,"Chemosensory proteins (CSPs) are small scavenger proteins that are mainly known as transporters of pheromone/odor molecules at the periphery of sensory neurons in the insect antennae and in the producing cells from the moth female pheromone gland. Sequencing cDNAs of RNA encoding CSPs in the antennae, legs, head, pheromone gland and wings from five single individual adult females of the silkworm moth Bombyx mori showed that they differed from genomic sequences by subtle nucleotide replacement (RDD). Both intronless and intronic CSP genes expressed RDDs, although in different rates. Most interestingly, in our study the degree of RDDs in CSP genes were found to be tissue-specific. The proportion of CSP-RDDs was found to be significantly much higher in the pheromone gland. In addition, Western blot analysis of proteins in different tissues showed existence of multiple CSP protein variant chains particularly found in the pheromone gland. Peptide sequencing demonstrated the occurrence of a pleiad of protein variants for most of all BmorCSPs from the pheromone gland. Our findings show that RNA editing is an important feature in the expression of CSPs and that a high variety of RDDs is found to expand drastically thus altering the repertoire of CSP proteins in a tissue-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W1999730528,"In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the production of many secreted virulence factors is controlled by a quorum-sensing (QS) circuit, constituted of transcriptional activators (LasR, RhlR, PqsR) and their cognate signaling molecules (3-oxo-C12-HSL, C4-HSL, PQS). QS is a cooperative behavior that is beneficial to a population but can be exploited by “QS-cheaters”, individuals which do not respond to the QS-signal, but can use public goods produced by QS-cooperators. In order to identify QS-deficient clones we designed a genetic screening based on a lasB-lacZ fusion. We isolated one clone (PT1617) deficient in QS-dependent gene expression and virulence factor production despite wild type lasR, rhlR and pqsR alleles. Whole genome sequencing of PT1617 revealed a 3,552 bp deletion encompassing ORFs PA2228-PA2229-PA2230 and the pslA gene. However, complementation of PT1617 by plasmid-encoded copies of these ORFs, did not restore QS. Unexpectedly, gene expression levels of ORFs PA2228, PA2227 (vqsM) and PA2222, located adjacent to the deletion, were 10 to 100 fold higher in mutant PT1617 than in PAO1. When expressed from a constitutive promoter on a plasmid, PA2226, alone was found to be sufficient to confer a QS-negative phenotype on PAO1 as well as on PA14. Co-expression of PA2226 and PA2225 in PAO1 further prevented induction of the type III secretion system. In summary, we have identified a novel genetic locus including ORF2226 termed qsrO (QS-repressing ORF), capable of down-regulating all three known QS-systems in P. aeruginosa."
https://openalex.org/W2012197335,"Trypanosoma brucei expresses a diverse repertoire of N-glycans, ranging from oligomannose and paucimannose structures to exceptionally large complex N-glycans. Despite the presence of the latter, no obvious homologues of known β1-4-galactosyltransferase or β1-2- or β1-6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase genes have been found in the parasite genome. However, we previously reported a family of putative UDP-sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases with similarity to the mammalian β1-3-glycosyltransferase family. Here we characterize one of these genes, TbGT11, and show that it encodes a Golgi apparatus resident UDP-GlcNAc:α3-D-mannoside β1-2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I activity (TbGnTI). The bloodstream-form TbGT11 null mutant exhibited significantly modified protein N-glycans but normal growth in vitro and infectivity to rodents. In contrast to multicellular organisms, where the GnTI reaction is essential for biosynthesis of both complex and hybrid N-glycans, T. brucei TbGT11 null mutants expressed atypical ""pseudohybrid"" glycans, indicating that TbGnTII activity is not dependent on prior TbGnTI action. Using a functional in vitro assay, we showed that TbGnTI transfers UDP-GlcNAc to biantennary Man3GlcNAc2, but not to triantennary Man5GlcNAc2, which is the preferred substrate for metazoan GnTIs. Sequence alignment reveals that the T. brucei enzyme is far removed from the metazoan GnTI family and suggests that the parasite has adapted the β3-glycosyltransferase family to catalyze β1-2 linkages."
https://openalex.org/W2017055625,"We assessed the change over time in the contribution of maternal mortality to a life expectancy calculated between ages 15 and 49, or Reproductive-Aged Life Expectancy (RALE). Our goal was to estimate the increase in RALE in developed countries over the twentieth century and the hypothetical gains in African countries today by eliminating maternal mortality.Analogous to life expectancy, RALE is calculated from a life table of ages 15 to 49. Specifically, RALE is the average number of years that women at age 15 would be expected to live between 15 and 49 with current mortality rates. Associated single decrement life tables of causes of death other than maternal mortality are explored to assess the possible gains in RALE by reducing or eliminating maternal mortality. We used population-based data from the Human Mortality Database and the Demographic and Health Surveys.In developed countries, five years in RALE were gained over the twentieth century, of which approximately 10%, or half a year, was attributable to reductions in maternal mortality. In sub-Saharan African countries, the possible achievable gains fluctuate between 0.24 and 1.47 years, or 6% and 44% of potential gains in RALE.Maternal mortality is a rare event, yet it is still a very important component of RALE. Averting the burden of maternal deaths could return a significant increase in the most productive ages of human life."
https://openalex.org/W1971387762,"Disease outbreaks due to the consumption of legume seedlings contaminated with human enteric bacterial pathogens like Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica are reported every year. Besides contaminations occurring during food processing, pathogens present on the surface or interior of plant tissues are also responsible for such outbreaks. In the present study, surface and internal colonization of Medicago truncatula, a close relative of alfalfa, by Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli O157:H7 were observed even with inoculum levels as low as two bacteria per plant. Furthermore, expression analyses revealed that approximately 30% of Medicago truncatula genes were commonly regulated in response to both of these enteric pathogens. This study highlights that very low inoculum doses trigger responses from the host plant and that both of these human enteric pathogens may in part use similar mechanisms to colonize legume seedlings."
https://openalex.org/W2005412680,"Temporal-Spatial of dengue virus (DENV) analyses have been performed in previous epidemiological studies in mainland China, but few studies have examined the whole genome of the DENV. Herein, 40 whole genome sequences of DENVs isolated from mainland China were downloaded from GenBank. Phylogenetic analyses and evolutionary distances of the dengue serotypes 1 and 2 were calculated using 14 maximum likelihood trees created from individual genes and whole genome. Amino acid variations were also analyzed in the 40 sequences that included dengue serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4, and they were grouped according to temporal and spatial differences. The results showed that none of the phylogenetic trees created from each individual gene were similar to the trees created using the complete genome and the evolutionary distances were variable with each individual gene. The number of amino acid variations was significantly different (p = 0.015) between DENV-1 and DENV-2 after 2001; seven mutations, the N290D, L402F and A473T mutations in the E gene region and the R101K, G105R, D340E and L349M mutations in the NS1 region of DENV-1, had significant substitutions, compared to the amino acids of DENV-2. Based on the spatial distribution using Guangzhou, including Foshan, as the indigenous area and the other regions as expanding areas, significant differences in the number of amino acid variations in the NS3 (p = 0.03) and NS1 (p = 0.024) regions and the NS2B (p = 0.016) and NS3 (p = 0.042) regions were found in DENV-1 and DENV-2. Recombination analysis showed no inter-serotype recombination events between the DENV-1 and DENV-2, while six and seven breakpoints were found in DENV-1 and DENV-2. Conclusively, the individual genes might not be suitable to analyze the evolution and selection pressure isolated in mainland China; the mutations in the amino acid residues in the E, NS1 and NS3 regions may play important roles in DENV-1 and DENV-2 epidemics."
https://openalex.org/W2020821243,"The role of Skp1 as an adaptor protein that links Cullin-1 to F-box proteins in E3 Skp1/Cullin-1/F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligases is well characterized. In the social amoeba Dictyostelium and probably many other unicellular eukaryotes, Skp1 is modified by a pentasaccharide attached to a hydroxyproline near its C terminus. This modification is important for oxygen-sensing during Dictyostelium development and is mediated by a HIF-α type prolyl 4-hydroxylase and five sequentially acting cytoplasmic glycosyltransferase activities. Gene disruption studies show that AgtA, the enzyme responsible for addition of the final two galactose residues, in α-linkages to the Skp1 core trisaccharide, is unexpectedly critical for oxygen-dependent terminal development. AgtA possesses a WD40 repeat domain C-terminal to its single catalytic domain and, by use of domain deletions, binding studies, and enzyme assays, we find that the WD40 repeats confer a salt-sensitive second-site binding interaction with Skp1 that mediates novel catalytic activation in addition to simple substrate recognition. In addition, AgtA binds similarly well to precursor isoforms of Skp1 by a salt-sensitive mechanism that competes with binding to an F-box protein and recognition by early modification enzymes, and the effect of binding is diminished when AgtA modifies Skp1. Genetic studies show that loss of AgtA is more severe when an earlier glycosylation step is blocked, and overexpressed AgtA is deleterious if catalytically inactivated. Together, the findings suggest that AgtA mediates non-enzymatic control of unmodified and substrate precursor forms of Skp1 by a binding mechanism that is normally relieved by switch-like activation of its glycosylation function.

AgtA regulates the execution of a developmental process in Dictyostelium known as culmination. Culmination refers to the transition in the starvation-induced developmental program in which the migrating slug reorganizes into a fruiting body consisting of dormant spores perched atop a cellular stalk. Environmental O2 is one of several regulators of culmination, and substantial evidence indicates that the Skp1 prolyl 4-hydroxylase, an O2-dependent enzyme required for formation of the 4-hydroxyproline to which the glycan is attached, is an O2-sensor for culmination. Further genetic analysis has revealed that PgtA, a bifunctional diglycosyltransferase that catalyzes addition of the second and third sugars, and AgtA, modulate the response to Skp1 prolyl hydroxylation (see pathway scheme in Fig. 1A). Remarkably, the effect of interrupting the AgtA locus is nearly as severe as blockade of hydroxylation itself as opposed to disruption of PgtA, which shows only a modest effect (6.Wang Z.A. van der Wel H.

Chem. 2009; 284: 28896-28904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the high level of overexpressed protein might mask a critical function of the WD40 repeats, which represent one of the most common protein domains in nature and often mediate protein-protein interactions (9.Xu C.

WD40 proteins propel cellular networks.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Most eukaryotic GTs are type 2 membrane proteins consisting of a single catalytic domain connected by a linker region to an N-terminal transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic extension (13.Colley K.J. Golgi localization of glycosyltransferases: more questions than answers.Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), but AgtA and the other Skp1 GTs lack these domains and exist as soluble cytoplasmic proteins. Although the WD40 repeats of AgtA are unprecedented for known GTs, other GTs possess SH3 (14.Ihara H. Ikeda Y. Toma S. Wang X. Suzuki T. Gu J. Miyoshi E. Tsukihara T. Honke K. Matsumoto A.

Letter to the Glyco-Forum: catalytic domains of glycosyltransferases with “add-on” domains.Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 7G-9GCrossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) have been implicated in acceptor substrate recognition, as has the linker region of a type 2 membrane GT (18.Zapater J.L.

Thus the AgtA C-terminal domain may contribute to Skp1 recognition, although it is noted that the earlier GTs in the pathway, the αGlcNAcT (Gnt1) and PgtA (see Fig. 1A), do not rely on add-on domains to achieve exquisite selectivity for Skp1 in vitro (7.van der Wel H.

Here we investigate the functionality of the AgtA WD40 repeat domain in the recognition of Skp1 by AgtA. Our investigations show that the modification by AgtA of Skp1 depends on the WD40 repeats by a mechanism that not only involves second site recognition but novel catalytic activation. Furthermore, Skp1 recognition by AgtA is competitive in vitro with F-box protein (FBP) binding required for SCF complex assembly, and interferes with early Skp1 processing steps in cells. The importance of a non-enzymatic function of AgtA is supported by the blockade of culmination that occurs in a double knock-out with the first Skp1 GT Gnt1 in which the substrate form of Skp1 is not assembled. The findings are interpreted in terms of a binding activity that titrates the interaction of Skp1 with FBPs and other binding partners and is relieved by execution of its glycosylation function. Cells were grown axenically in HL-5 medium, and assayed for O2-dependent development as described previously (19.West C.M. van der Wel H. Wang Z.A.

Briefly, cells were deposited on filters in PDF buffer and developed in the dark for 42 h under the indicated O2 concentrations with the balance made up with N2. Development was assessed by fruiting body morphology, and quantification of total spore numbers as counted in a hemacytometer. Stalk morphology was imaged in the DAPI channel of an epifluorescence microscope in the presence of Calcofluor White ST to reveal cellulosic cell walls (19.West C.M. van der Wel H. Wang Z.A.

These pVSC-derived plasmids are designed to stably overexpress DpGnt1 (the ortholog from D. purpureum) under control of the prespore cell-specific cotB promoter.

Reaction progress was monitored by the transfer of [3H]Gal from UDP-[6-3H]Gal to synthetic glycosides or Skp1. The standard reaction was prepared in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2), 10 μm UDP-[3H]Gal, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MnCl2, and 5 mm DTT, in 20 μl for protein or peptide substrates and 50 μl for other substrates. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme and incubated for 30 min at 22 °C. Conditions were varied as noted, and incubation times and enzyme levels were adjusted to ensure that measurements were carried out under initial velocity conditions. UDP-[6-3H]Gal was diluted with non-radioactive UDP-αGal to achieve final concentrations. UDP-[6-3H]Gal was obtained from American Radiochemical Corporation (20 mCi/μmol) or Amersham Biosciences. The latter, a generous gift from Joel Shaper (Johns Hopkins School of Public Health), was originally synthesized in 1984 and stored according to the manufacturer's recommendation. UDP-[6-3H]Gal was repurified by chromatography over a Q-anion exchange column as described (21.Fudem-Goldin B. Voulalas P. Orr G.A. Synthesis and rapid purification of UDP-[6-3H]galactose.J. Biochem.

UDP-[6-3H]Gal was eluted with 30% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. Its properties were indistinguishable from that of recently prepared material in pilot enzyme assays. Reactions using substrates F-pNP, FG-octyl, and FGGn-pNP were stopped by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 1 mm sodium EDTA (pH 8.0). Reaction mixtures were applied to a 0.5-ml high-cap SepPak C18 cartridge (Grace-Alltech), washed six times with 5 ml of H2O, and eluted with 5 ml of MeOH. Samples were added to 8 ml of Biosafe II scintillation counting fluid (RPI) and radioactivity was quantitated using a Beckman L6500 scintillation counter. Blank activities determined from reactions lacking substrates were subtracted. Reactions using Skp1 as a substrate were stopped by addition of 80 μl of ice-cold 10 mm sodium EDTA (pH 8.0), 20 μl of 100 mg/ml of BSA, and 1 ml of 10% (v/v) TCA to precipitate proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2044953704,"Free Man(7-9)GlcNAc2 is released during the biosynthesis pathway of N-linked glycans or from misfolded glycoproteins during the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation process and are reduced to Man5GlcNAc in the cytosol. In this form, free oligosaccharides can be transferred into the lysosomes to be degraded completely. α-Mannosidase (MAN2C1) is the enzyme responsible for the partial demannosylation occurring in the cytosol. It has been demonstrated that the inhibition of MAN2C1 expression induces accumulation of Man(8-9)GlcNAc oligosaccharides and apoptosis in vitro. We investigated the consequences caused by the lack of cytosolic α-mannosidase activity in vivo by the generation of Man2c1-deficient mice. Increased amounts of Man(8-9)GlcNAc oligosaccharides were recognized in all analyzed KO tissues. Histological analysis of the CNS revealed neuronal and glial degeneration with formation of multiple vacuoles in deep neocortical layers and major telencephalic white matter tracts. Enterocytes of the small intestine accumulate mannose-containing saccharides and glycogen particles in their apical cytoplasm as well as large clear vacuoles in retronuclear position. Liver tissue is characterized by groups of hepatocytes with increased content of mannosyl compounds and glycogen, some of them undergoing degeneration by hydropic swelling. In addition, lectin screening showed the presence of mannose-containing saccharides in the epithelium of proximal kidney tubules, whereas scattered glomeruli appeared collapsed or featured signs of fibrosis along Bowman's capsule. Except for a moderate enrichment of mannosyl compounds and glycogen, heterozygous mice were normal, arguing against possible toxic effects of truncated Man2c1. These findings confirm the key role played by Man2c1 in the catabolism of free oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W2002854196,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is characterized by excessive fibrosis of the skin and internal organs due to fibroblast proliferation and excessive production of extracellular matrix (ECM). We have shown that insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-5 plays an important role in the development of fibrosis in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. We identified a membrane-associated adaptor protein, downstream of tyrosine kinase/docking protein (DOK)5, as an IGFBP-5-regulated target gene using gene expression profiling of primary fibroblasts expressing IGFBP-5. DOK5 is a tyrosine kinase substrate associated with intracellular signaling. Our objective was to determine the role of DOK5 in the pathogenesis of SSc and specifically in IGFBP-5-induced fibrosis. DOK5 mRNA and protein levels were increased in vitro by endogenous and exogenous IGFBP-5 in primary human fibroblasts. DOK5 upregulation required activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade. Further, IGFBP-5 triggered nuclear translocation of DOK5. DOK5 protein levels were also increased in vivo in mouse skin and lung by IGFBP-5. To determine the effect of DOK5 on fibrosis, DOK5 was expressed ex vivo in human skin in organ culture. Expression of DOK5 in human skin resulted in a significant increase in dermal thickness. Lastly, levels of DOK5 were compared in primary fibroblasts and lung tissues of patients with SSc and healthy donors. Both DOK5 mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased in fibroblasts and skin tissues of patients with SSc compared with those of healthy controls, as well as in lung tissues of SSc patients. Our findings suggest that IGFBP-5 induces its pro-fibrotic effects, at least in part, via DOK5. Furthermore, IGFBP-5 and DOK5 are both increased in SSc fibroblasts and tissues and may thus be acting in concert to promote fibrosis."

Mast cell-derived tryptase can activate protease activated receptor type-2 (PAR-2) of BSM cells. The aims of the present study were (i) to evaluate the expression of PAR-2 in both asthmatic and non asthmatic BSM cells and, (ii) to analyze the effect of prolonged stimulation of PAR-2 in asthmatic BSM cells on cell signaling and proliferation. BSM cells were obtained from both 33 control subjects and 22 asthmatic patients. PAR-2 expression was assessed by flow cytometry, western blot and quantitative RT-PCR. Calcium response, transduction pathways and proliferation were evaluated before and following PAR-2 stimulation by SLIGKV-NH2 or trypsin for 1 to 3 days. Asthmatic BSM cells expressed higher basal levels of functional PAR-2 compared to controls in terms of mRNA, protein expression and calcium response. When PAR-2 expression was increased by means of lentivirus in control BSM cells to a level similar to that of asthmatic cells, PAR-2-induced calcium response was then similar in both types of cell. However, repeated PAR-2 stimulations increased the proliferation of asthmatic BSM cells but not that of control BSM cells even following lentiviral over-expression of PAR-2. Such an increased proliferation was related to an increased phosphorylation of ERK in asthmatic BSM cells. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that asthmatic BSM cells express increased baseline levels of functional PAR-2. This higher basal level of PAR-2 accounts for the increased calcium response to PAR-2 stimulation, whereas the increased proliferation to repeated PAR-2 stimulation is related to increased ERK phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1974745078,"De novo sequencing is an important computational approach to determining the amino acid sequence of a peptide with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Most of the existing approaches use a graph model to describe a spectrum and the sequencing is performed by computing the longest antisymmetric path in the graph. The task is often computationally intensive since a given MS/MS spectrum often contains noisy data, missing mass peaks, or post translational modifications/mutations. This paper develops a new parameterized algorithm that can efficiently compute the longest antisymmetric partial path in an extended spectrum graph that is of bounded path width. Our testing results show that this algorithm can efficiently process experimental spectra and provide sequencing results of high accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2004156909,"Objectives The aim of this pilot study was to investigate associations between IL-6 and COX-2 expression in gingival biopsies and both clinical diagnosis and genotypes in the IL-6 and COX-2 genes. Design A case-control study included 41 gingival biopsies obtained from Caucasian patients grouped according to clinical diagnosis of gingival health (n = 10), gingivitis (n = 15) or chronic periodontitis (n = 16). Immunohistochemistry analyses were performed to determine COX-2 expression in lamina propria, IL-6 expression in lamina propria and gingival epithelium and level of inflammatory cell infiltrate. Individual DNA was extracted and genotyped by real-time PCR for IL6 SNPs rs 2069827 and rs 2069825 and for COX-2 rs 6681231. Results The percentage of cellular COX-2 expression was associated with the extent of periodontal disease (Arbes index p = 0.026) and inflammatory infiltrate (p<0.0001). No association was observed between IL6 haplotypes and cells positive to IL-6 or COX-2 in gingival tissues. The COX-2 rs 6681231 was associated with cells positive to IL-6 in the connective tissue (p = 0.032). Conclusions COX-2 expression in gingival tissues may be a marker of periodontal disease severity. COX-2 rs 6681231 may be associated with IL-6 local production in gingival tissues."

Because access to the cochlea is restricted in live animals, and important aspects of hearing are destroyed in dead ones, models play a key role in interpreting local measurements. Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) models are attractive because they are analytically tractable, appropriate to the oblong geometry of the cochlea, and can predict wave behavior over a large span of the cochlea. Interest in the role the tectorial membrane (TM) plays in cochlear tuning led us to develop models that directly interface the TM with the cochlear fluid. In this work we add an angled shear between the TM and reticular lamina (RL), which serves as an input to a nonlinear active force. This feature plus a novel combination of previous work gives us a model with TM-fluid interaction, TM-RL shear, a nonlinear active force and a second wave mode. The behavior we get leads to the conclusion the phase between the shear and basilar membrane (BM) vibration is critical for amplification. We show there is a transition in this phase that occurs at a frequency below the cutoff, which is strongly influenced by TM stiffness. We describe this mechanism of sharpened BM velocity profile, which demonstrates the importance of the TM in overall cochlear tuning and offers an explanation for the response characteristics of the Tectb mutant mouse."
https://openalex.org/W2046513744,"Soil represents the largest store of mercury (Hg) in terrestrial ecosystems, and further study of the factors associated with soil Hg storage is needed to address concerns about the magnitude and persistence of global environmental Hg bioaccumulation. To address this need, we compared total Hg and methyl Hg concentrations and stores in the soil of different landscapes in two watersheds in different geographic settings with similar and relatively high methyl Hg concentrations in surface waters and biota, Fishing Brook, Adirondack Mountains, New York, and McTier Creek, Coastal Plain, South Carolina. Median total Hg concentrations and stores in organic and mineral soil samples were three-fold greater at Fishing Brook than at McTier Creek. Similarly, median methyl Hg concentrations were about two-fold greater in Fishing Brook soil than in McTier Creek soil, but this difference was significant only for mineral soil samples, and methyl Hg stores were not significantly different among these watersheds. In contrast, the methyl Hg/total Hg ratio was significantly greater at McTier Creek suggesting greater climate-driven methylation efficiency in the Coastal Plain soil than that of the Adirondack Mountains. The Adirondack soil had eight-fold greater soil organic matter than that of the Coastal Plain, consistent with greater total Hg stores in the northern soil, but soil organic matter – total Hg relations differed among the sites. A strong linear relation was evident at McTier Creek (r2 = 0.68; p<0.001), but a linear relation at Fishing Brook was weak (r2 = 0.13; p<0.001) and highly variable across the soil organic matter content range, suggesting excess Hg binding capacity in the Adirondack soil. These results suggest greater total Hg turnover time in Adirondack soil than that of the Coastal Plain, and that future declines in stream water Hg concentrations driven by declines in atmospheric Hg deposition will be more gradual and prolonged in the Adirondacks."
https://openalex.org/W2065848801,"Nonnative disulfide bonds have been observed among protein aggregates in several diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cataract and so on. The molecular mechanism by which formation of such bonds promotes protein aggregation is poorly understood. Here in this work we employ previously well characterized aggregation of hen eggwhite lysozyme (HEWL) at alkaline pH to dissect the molecular role of nonnative disulfide bonds on growth of HEWL aggregates. We employed time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, atomic force microscopy and single-molecule force spectroscopy to quantify the size, morphology and non-covalent interaction forces among the aggregates, respectively. These measurements were performed under conditions when disulfide bond formation was allowed (control) and alternatively when it was prevented by alkylation of free thiols using iodoacetamide. Blocking disulfide bond formation affected growth but not growth kinetics of aggregates which were ∼50% reduced in volume, flatter in vertical dimension and non-fibrillar in comparison to control. Interestingly, single-molecule force spectroscopy data revealed that preventing disulfide bond formation weakened the non-covalent interaction forces among monomers in the aggregate by at least ten fold, thereby stalling their growth and yielding smaller aggregates in comparison to control. We conclude that while constrained protein chain dynamics in correctly disulfide bonded amyloidogenic proteins may protect them from venturing into partial folded conformations that can trigger entry into aggregation pathways, aberrant disulfide bonds in non-amyloidogenic proteins (like HEWL) on the other hand, may strengthen non-covalent intermolecular forces among monomers and promote their aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2064738239,"An individual's reproductive success will depend on traits that increase access to mates, as well as the number of mates available. In most well-studied mammals, males are the larger sex, and body size often increases success in intra-sexual contests and thus paternity. In comparison, the determinants of male success in species with reversed sexual size dimorphism (RSD) are less well understood. Greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) exhibit RSD and females appear to exert mate choice when they visit and copulate with males in their underground territories. Here we assessed putative determinants of reproductive success in a colony of greater horseshoe bats during a 19-year period of rapid population growth. We genotyped 1080 bats with up to 40 microsatellite loci and assigned maternity to 99.5% of pups, and paternity to 76.8% of pups. We found that in spite of RSD, paternity success correlated positively with male size, and, consistent with our previous findings, also with age. Female reproductive success, which has not previously been studied in this population, was also age-related and correlated positively with individual heterozygosity, but not with body size. Remarkable male reproductive skew was detected that initially increased steadily with population size, possibly coinciding with the saturation of suitable territories, but then levelled off suggesting an upper limit to a male's number of partners. Our results illustrate that RSD can occur alongside intense male sexual competition, that male breeding success is density-dependent, and that male and female greater horseshoe bats are subject to different selective pressures."
https://openalex.org/W1968627442,"Objective The objective of this study was to determine the effect of epithelial barrier disruption, caused by deficiency of the membrane-anchored serine protease, matriptase, on salivary gland function and the induction of autoimmunity in an animal model. Methods Embryonic and acute ablation of matriptase expression in the salivary glands of mice was induced, leading to decreased epithelial barrier function. Mice were characterized for secretory epithelial function and the induction of autoimmunity including salivary and lacrimal gland dysfunction, lymphocytic infiltration, serum anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB and antinuclear antibodies. Salivary glands immune activation/regulation, barrier function as well as tight junction proteins expression also were determined. Expression of matriptase in minor salivary gland biopsies was compared among pSS patients and healthy volunteers. Results Embryonic ablation of matriptase expression in mice resulted in the loss of secretory epithelial cell function and the induction of autoimmunity similar to that observed in primary Sjögren’s syndrome. Phenotypic changes included exocrine gland dysfunction, lymphocytic infiltrates, production of Sjögren’s syndrome-specific autoantibodies, and overall activation of the immune system. Acute ablation of matriptase expression resulted in significant salivary gland dysfunction in the absence of overt immune activation. Analysis of the salivary glands indicates a loss of electrical potential across the epithelial layer as well as altered distribution of a tight junction protein. Moreover, a significant decrease in matriptase gene expression was detected in the minor salivary glands of pSS patients compared with healthy volunteers. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that local impairment of epithelial barrier function can lead to loss of exocrine gland dysfunction in the absence of inflammation while systemic deletion can induce a primary Sjögren’s syndrome like phenotype with autoimmunity and loss of gland function."
https://openalex.org/W1994236849,"Venom-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication of Bothrops snakebite with relevant morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of Schizolobium parahyba (SP) extract, a natural medicine with presumed anti-Bothrops venom effects, in an experimental model of Bothrops jararaca venom (BV)-induced AKI.Groups of 8 to 10 rats received infusions of 0.9% saline (control, C), SP 2 mg/kg, BV 0.25 mg/kg and BV immediately followed by SP (treatment, T) in the doses already described. After the respective infusions, animals were assessed for their glomerular filtration rate (GFR, inulin clearance), renal blood flow (RBF, Doppler), blood pressure (BP, intra-arterial transducer), renal vascular resistance (RVR), urinary osmolality (UO, freezing point), urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, kinetic method), hematocrit (Hct, microhematocrit), fibrinogen (Fi, Klauss modified) and blinded renal histology (acute tubular necrosis score).BV caused significant decreases in GFR, RBF, UO, HcT and Fi; significant increases in RVR, NGAL and LDH; and acute tubular necrosis. SP did not prevent these changes; instead, it caused a significant decrease in GFR when used alone.SP administered simultaneously with BV, in an approximate 10∶1 concentration, did not prevent BV-induced AKI, hemolysis and fibrinogen consumption. SP used alone caused a decrease in GFR."
https://openalex.org/W2005645324,"Clinical trials have shown that early initiation of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis saves lives, but models for implementation of this new strategy have been under-studied in real-world settings.To identify the barriers and possible solutions for implementing concurrent early treatment with antiretroviral and anti-tuberculosis therapy in a large East African referral hospital where the prevalence of both infections is high.In-depth interviews among hospital administrators, laboratory technicians, nurses, pharmacists, and physicians.Twenty-six hospital staff identified six key barriers and corresponding solutions to promote rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected inpatients with tuberculosis. These include revising systems of medication delivery, integrating care between inpatient and outpatient systems, training hospital nurses to counsel and initiate medications in inpatients, and cultivating a team approach to consistent guideline implementation.Most barriers identified by hospital staff were easily surmountable with reorganization, training, and policy changes at minimal cost. Efforts to reduce mortality for HIV and tuberculosis co-infected patients in accordance with new World Health Organization guidelines are currently hampered by implementation barriers in real-world settings. Our findings suggest that these can be overcome with strategic enactment of simple, realistic interventions to promote early dual treatment for HIV/tuberculosis co-infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W2001945583,"The asymmetric distribution of damaged cellular components has been observed in species ranging from fission yeast to humans. To study the potential advantages of damage segregation, we have developed a mathematical model describing ageing mammalian tissue, that is, a multicellular system of somatic cells that do not rejuvenate at cell division. To illustrate the applicability of the model, we specifically consider damage incurred by mutations to mitochondrial DNA, which are thought to be implicated in the mammalian ageing process. We show analytically that the asymmetric distribution of damaged cellular components reduces the overall damage level and increases the longevity of the cell population. Motivated by the experimental reports of damage segregation in human embryonic stem cells, dividing symmetrically with respect to cell-fate, we extend the model to consider spatially structured systems of cells. Imposing spatial structure reduces, but does not eliminate, the advantage of asymmetric division over symmetric division. The results suggest that damage partitioning could be a common strategy for reducing the accumulation of damage in a wider range of cell types than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W1964055216,"Conserved motifs in biological sequences are closely related to their structure and functions. Recently, discriminative motif discovery methods have attracted more and more attention. However, little attention has been devoted to the data imbalance problem, which is one of the main reasons affecting the performance of the discriminative models. In this article, a simulated evolution method is applied to solve the multi-class imbalance problem at the stage of data preprocessing, and at the stage of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) training, a random under-sampling method is introduced for the imbalance between the positive and negative datasets. It is shown that, in the task of discovering targeting motifs of nine subcellular compartments, the motifs found by our method are more conserved than the methods without considering data imbalance problem and recover the most known targeting motifs from Minimotif Miner and InterPro. Meanwhile, we use the found motifs to predict protein subcellular localization and achieve higher prediction precision and recall for the minority classes."
