https://openalex.org/W2121237571,"Benzodiazepine tranquilizers are used in the treatment of anxiety disorders. To identify the molecular and neuronal target mediating the anxiolytic action of benzodiazepines, we generated and analyzed two mouse lines in which the α2 or α3 GABA A (γ-aminobutyric acid type A) receptors, respectively, were rendered insensitive to diazepam by a knock-in point mutation. The anxiolytic action of diazepam was absent in mice with the α2(H101R) point mutation but present in mice with the α3(H126R) point mutation. These findings indicate that the anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepine drugs is mediated by α2 GABA A receptors, which are largely expressed in the limbic system, but not by α3 GABA A receptors, which predominate in the reticular activating system."
https://openalex.org/W1854324009,Memapsin 2 (β-secretase) is a membrane-associated aspartic protease involved in the production of β-amyloid peptide in Alzheimer's disease and is a major target for drug design. We determined the crystal structure of the protease domain of human memapsin 2 complexed to an eight-residue inhibitor at 1.9 angstrom resolution. The active site of memapsin 2 is more open and less hydrophobic than that of other human aspartic proteases. The subsite locations from S 4 to S 2 ′ are well defined. A kink of the inhibitor chain at P 2 ′ and the change of chain direction of P 3 ′ and P 4 ′ may be mimicked to provide inhibitor selectivity.
https://openalex.org/W2091613063,"An insulinlike signaling pathway controls Caenorhabditis elegans aging, metabolism, and development. Mutations in the daf-2 insulin receptor-like gene or the downstream age-1 phosphoinositide 3-kinase gene extend adult life-span by two- to threefold. To identify tissues where this pathway regulates aging and metabolism, we restored daf-2 pathway signaling to only neurons, muscle, or intestine. Insulinlike signaling in neurons alone was sufficient to specify wild-type life-span, but muscle or intestinal signaling was not. However, restoring daf-2 pathway signaling to muscle rescued metabolic defects, thus decoupling regulation of life-span and metabolism. These findings point to the nervous system as a central regulator of animal longevity."
https://openalex.org/W2071595010,"Neuropathic pain arises as a debilitating consequence of nerve injury. The etiology of such pain is poorly understood, and existing treatment is largely ineffective. We demonstrate here that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) both prevented and reversed sensory abnormalities that developed in neuropathic pain models, without affecting pain-related behavior in normal animals. GDNF reduces ectopic discharges within sensory neurons after nerve injury. This may arise as a consequence of the reversal by GDNF of the injury-induced plasticity of several sodium channel subunits. Together these findings provide a rational basis for the use of GDNF as a therapeutic treatment for neuropathic pain states."
https://openalex.org/W1669533272,"Genes that control the early stages of adipogenesis remain largely unknown. Here, we show that murine GATA-2 and GATA-3 are specifically expressed in white adipocyte precursors and that their down-regulation sets the stage for terminal differentiation. Constitutive GATA-2 and GATA-3 expression suppressed adipocyte differentiation and trapped cells at the preadipocyte stage. This effect is mediated, at least in part, through the direct suppression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. GATA-3-deficient embryonic stem cells exhibit an enhanced capacity to differentiate into adipocytes, and defective GATA-2 and GATA-3 expression is associated with obesity. Thus, GATA-2 and GATA-3 regulate adipocyte differentiation through molecular control of the preadipocyte-adipocyte transition."
https://openalex.org/W1963634449,"Rearrangements involving the RET gene are common in radiation-associated papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). The RET/PTC1 type of rearrangement is an inversion of chromosome 10 mediated by illegitimate recombination between the RET and the H4 genes, which are 30 megabases apart. Here we ask whether despite the great linear distance between them, RET and H4 recombination might be promoted by their proximity in the nucleus. We used two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization and three-dimensional microscopy to map the positions of the RET and H4 loci within interphase nuclei. At least one pair of RET and H4 was juxtaposed in 35% of normal human thyroid cells and in 21% of peripheral blood lymphocytes, but only in 6% of normal mammary epithelial cells. Spatial contiguity of RET and H4 may provide a structural basis for generation of RET/PTC1 rearrangement by allowing a single radiation track to produce a double-strand break in each gene at the same site in the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2087018994,"Ascorbic acid has been shown to stimulate endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion without affecting NO synthase (NOS) expression or l-arginine uptake. The present study investigates if the underlying mechanism is related to the NOS cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin. Pretreatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with ascorbate (1 microm to 1 mm, 24 h) led to an up to 3-fold increase of intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin levels that was concentration-dependent and saturable at 100 microm. Accordingly, the effect of ascorbic acid on Ca(2+)-dependent formation of citrulline (co-product of NO) and cGMP (product of the NO-activated soluble guanylate cyclase) was abolished when intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin levels were increased by coincubation of endothelial cells with sepiapterin (0.001-100 microm, 24 h). In contrast, ascorbic acid did not modify the pterin affinity of endothelial NOS, which was measured in assays with purified tetrahydrobiopterin-free enzyme. The ascorbate-induced increase of endothelial tetrahydrobiopterin was not due to an enhanced synthesis of the compound. Neither the mRNA expression of the rate-limiting enzyme in tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis, GTP cyclohydrolase I, nor the activities of either GTP cyclohydrolase I or 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase, the second enzyme in the de novo synthesis pathway, were altered by ascorbate. Our data demonstrate that ascorbic acid leads to a chemical stabilization of tetrahydrobiopterin. This was evident as an increase in the half-life of tetrahydrobiopterin in aqueous solution. Furthermore, the increase of tetrahydrobiopterin levels in intact endothelial cells coincubated with cytokines and ascorbate was associated with a decrease of more oxidized biopterin derivatives (7,8-dihydrobiopterin and biopterin) in cells and cell supernatants. The present study suggests that saturated ascorbic acid levels in endothelial cells are necessary to protect tetrahydrobiopterin from oxidation and to provide optimal conditions for cellular NO synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2062916004,"Posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is an ancient eukaryotic regulatory mechanism in which a particular RNA sequence is targeted and destroyed. The helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro) of plant potyviruses suppresses PTGS in plants. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we identified a calmodulin-related protein (termed rgs-CaM) that interacts with HC-Pro. Here we report that rgs-CaM, like HC-Pro itself, suppresses gene silencing. Our work is the first report identifying a cellular suppressor of PTGS."
https://openalex.org/W2161691817,"We present the discovery by optical and near-infrared imaging of an extremely red, low-luminosity population of isolated objects in the young, nearby stellar cluster around the multiple, massive star σ Orionis. The proximity (352 parsecs), youth (1 million to 5 million years), and low internal extinction make this cluster an ideal site to explore the substellar domain from the hydrogen mass limit down to a few Jupiter masses. Optical and near-infrared low-resolution spectroscopy of three of these objects confirms the very cool spectral energy distribution (atmospheric effective temperatures of 1700 to 2200 kelvin) expected for cluster members with masses in the range 5 to 15 times that of Jupiter. Like the planets of the solar system, these objects are unable to sustain stable nuclear burning in their interiors, but in contrast they are not bound to stars. This new kind of isolated giant planet, which apparently forms on time scales of less than a few million years, offers a challenge to our understanding of the formation processes of planetary mass objects."
https://openalex.org/W2073816668,"Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) plays a pivotal role in regulation of intracellular signal transduction from various receptor molecules. More than 10 members of human PI-PLC isoforms have been identified and classified into three classes β, γ, and δ, which are regulated by distinct mechanisms. Here we report identification of a novel class of human PI-PLC, named PLCε, which is characterized by the presence of a Ras-associating domain at its C terminus and a CDC25-like domain at its N terminus. The Ras-associating domain of PLCε specifically binds to the GTP-bound forms of Ha-Ras and Rap1A. The dissociation constant for Ha-Ras is estimated to be approximately 40 nm, comparable with those of other Ras effectors. Co-expression of an activated Ha-Ras mutant with PLCε induces its translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. Upon stimulation with epidermal growth factor, similar translocation of ectopically expressed PLCε is observed, which is inhibited by co-expression of dominant-negative Ha-Ras. Furthermore, using a liposome-based reconstitution assay, it is shown that the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-hydrolyzing activity of PLCε is stimulated in vitro by Ha-Ras in a GTP-dependent manner. These results indicate that Ras directly regulates phosphoinositide breakdown through membrane targeting of PLCε.

Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). This reaction yields two intracellular second messengers, diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which induce activation of protein kinase C and mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, respectively. Concurrently, the reduction in the PIP2concentration is likely an important signal because activities of various actin-binding proteins and pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing proteins are modulated through interaction with PIP2 (2Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). PIP2 concentration at the membrane has also been shown to be important in maintenance of the cell shape through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (3Czech M.P. Cell. 2000; 100: 603-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). More than 10 members of human PI-PLC isoforms have been identified and classified into three classes, β, γ, and δ, exemplified by 150-kDa PLCβ1, 145-kDa PLCγ1, and 85-kDa PLCδ1, respectively (1Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). All the PI-PLC isoforms contain two regions of high sequence homology, designated X and Y, which constitute the PLC catalytic domain. In addition, other accessory modules, a PH domain, an EF-hand domain, and a C2 domain, are also shared by all the mammalian PLC isoforms reported so far (see Fig.1 A). The three classes of PI-PLCs are linked to receptors by distinct mechanisms (1Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar): PLCβ isozymes are activated by the α subunits of the Gq subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins as well as by the Gβγ dimer, whereas PLCγ isozymes are activated by both receptor type and nonreceptor type protein tyrosine kinases through tyrosine phosphorylation. Ras proto-oncoproteins are small GTP-binding proteins that function as molecular switches by cycling between the active GTP-bound state and the inactive GDP-bound state (4Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). They regulate a variety of biological responses including proliferation and differentiation of mammalian cells. In mammalian cells, membrane-anchored GTP-bound Ras interacts directly with the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1, leading to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (5Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.-W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In addition, recent searches have identified a number of candidate Ras effectors other than Raf-1 and its isoforms B-Raf and A-Raf in mammalian cells (6Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). All these effector proteins exhibit a GTP-dependent interaction with Ras, for which the intact effector region (residues 32–40 of mammalian Ras) is required (4Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 5Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.-W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem.

This interaction, when made with post-translationally modified Ras, induces translocation of the effectors from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where their substrates or activators are localized. The Ras-dependent membrane translocation has been shown to be prerequisite to activation of the Ras effectors, Raf-1 (7Morrison D.K. Cutler Jr., R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (8Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J.

Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2899-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Some of the candidate effectors of Ras, including RalGDS and AF-6/Afadin (10Kuriyama M. Harada N. Kuroda S.

Gene (Amst.). 1998; 224: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), have been shown to possess homologous motifs of about 100 amino acids in their Ras-associating (RA) regions (12Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Recently, the RA domain of RalGDS was reported to share a similar tertiary structure, the ubiquitin superfold, with the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1, although they exhibit no apparent homology in their amino acid sequences (13Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 14Huang L. Weng X. Hofer F. Martin G.S. Kim S.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Rap1A, another member of Ras family small GTP-binding proteins, possesses an identical effector region with that of Ras and associates with almost all effector molecules of Ras (15Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Although its physiological functions remain to be investigated, the findings that Rap1A can activate the Ras effector B-Raf and may cooperate with Ras in regulation of B-Raf-mediated responses in some cell types (16Vossler M.R.

McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) suggest that Rap1A may regulate the activity of other Ras effectors as well. Recently, Rap1 has been implicated in integrin-mediated cell adhesion signaling following stimulation of cell surface molecules, such as the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (18Tsukamoto N.

Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In this report, we have identified a novel class of human PI-PLC, named PLCε, which is characterized by the presence of an RA domain, as a human homolog of Caenorhabditis elegans PLC210 (21Shibatohge M.

We demonstrate that PLCε is regulated through direct association with Ras, adding another member to the growing list of Ras effectors. The BLAST search (22Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W.

To isolate cDNAs coding for the upstream sequences, we performed 5′-RACE (23Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The nucleotide sequences of the 5′-RACE-amplified cDNAs were confirmed by isolating and sequencing multiple clones. The post-translationally modified forms of human Ha-Ras and Rap1A were purified as described before (24Kuroda Y. Suzuki N. Kataoka T.

Residues 2094–2303 of PLCε, encompassing the RA domain, were expressed in Escherichia coli as an maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion by using the pMAL-c plasmid. The resulting MBP-PLCε (2094–2303) was examined forin vitro association with Ha-Ras and Rap1A, which had been loaded with GTPγS or GDPβS, as described before (25Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Tamada M.

Interaction of PLCε (2094–2303) with various effector region mutants of Ha-Ras was examined by the yeast two-hybrid assay employing pGAD-PLCε (2094–2303) and pGBT-Ha-RasG12V carrying the mutations as described (27Akasaka K.

The β-galactosidase activity was measured by a filter assay as described (28Bartel P.L. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar) Measurements ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae adenylyl cyclase activity dependent on GTPγS-loaded Ha-Ras and its inhibition by purified MBP-PLCε (2094–2303) were carried out as described before (29Minato T. Wang J. Akasaka K. Okada T. Suzuki N. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20845-20851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length PLCε was expressed with a FLAG epitope tag in Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells by using a baculovirus vector pVL1393 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). FLAG-PLCε was affinity purified with resin conjugated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma). The PI-PLC activities were measured essentially as described (21Shibatohge M. Kariya K. Liao Y.

Briefly, the fusion proteins were incubated in 50-μl reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Mes, pH 6.8, 10 μm Ca2+/EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 90 μm[3H]PIP2 (20,000 cpm), and 80 μm phosphatidylethanolamine at 30 °C for 30 min. [3H]Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate produced was extracted and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Various EGTA/Ca2+ buffers giving different concentrations of free Ca2+ were prepared as described (30Homma Y. Emori Y. Shears S. Signaling by Inositides. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 99-116Google Scholar). pGEX-PLCδ1 (provided by Dr. Tadaomi Takenawa, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) was used for expression of the full-length rat PLCδ1 as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion in E. coli. For a liposome-based reconstitution assay, liposomes were made similarly as described (8Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) by sonication of dried lipids in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 7 mm EDTA, and 5 mm MgCl2. The final lipid concentration was 640 μmphosphatidylethanolamine, 600 μm phosphatidylserine, 280 μm phosphatidylcholine, 60 μm sphingomyelin and 160 nm [3H]PIP2 (5,000 cpm/pmol). Post-translationally modified Ha-Ras preloaded with either GTPγS or GDPβS was added to the liposomes at a final concentration of 35 nm and mixed at 4 °C for 90 min. Liposomes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h and resuspended in the same volume of the buffer. The PIP2-hydrolyzing activity of PLCε was measured as described above by incubating 0.1 pmol of purified FLAG-PLCε with the liposomes in a total volume of 50 μl. Full-length PLCε was expressed in COS-7 cells as an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion. COS-7 cells were cultured in a slide chamber in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected with pcDNA-EGFP-PLCε in combination with a pEFBOS-HA vector carrying Ha-Ras or its mutants (0.5 μg each) by using superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Cells were transferred to serum-free medium 8 h post-transfection and further cultured for 18 h. After fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100, cells were stained with mouse anti-influenza virus HA monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) followed by rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. Localizations of PLCε and Ha-Ras were analyzed under a confocal laser microscope (MRC-1024; Bio-Rad). Full-length PLCε was expressed with a FLAG epitope tag using pFLAG-CMV (Sigma). COS-7 cells transfected with pFLAG-CMV-PLCε in combination with pEFBOS-HA-Ha-RasG12V or pEFBOS-HA-Ha-RasG12V,Y32F were subjected to serum starvation for 18 h and lysed in buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μm leupeptin) and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min. HA-Ha-Ras was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant with anti-HA monoclonal antibody. Ha-Ras and PLCε in the immunoprecipitates were detected by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody and affinity purified rabbit polyclonal anti-PLCε antibody raised against PLCε (2094–2303), respectively. For examination of subcellular localization, COS-7 cells expressing the above proteins were lysed in buffer A without 1% Triton X-100 by sonication. The lysates were separated into the membrane and cytosolic fractions by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. FLAG-PLCε in the membrane and cytosolic fractions was detected with anti-PLCε antibody. Nucleotide sequence determination of the human EST clone zb59f12 revealed a striking homology to the C-terminal region of C. elegans PLC210 including the Y, C2, and RA domains (Fig. 1, A andB), suggesting that this may represent a human homolog of PLC210. We isolated cDNAs coding for the upstream sequences by the 5′-RACE procedure using a human fetal brain cDNA library as a template. A putative initiator ATG was identified in the 5′-RACE-amplified cDNAs as that matched the Kozak consensus sequence (31Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3583) Google Scholar) and preceded by in-frame stop codons. A composite cDNA was reconstructed by joining the 5′-RACE-amplified clones and the EST clone zb59f12 and shown to encode the full-length protein with the size of 2,303 amino acid residues. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with GenBankTM entries indicated that this protein possessed the X, Y, and C2 domains, which were sandwiched between an N-terminal CDC25-like domain and a C-terminal RA domain (Fig. 1, A and B). The CDC25-like domain is homologous to a family of guanine nucleotide exchange proteins for Ras, represented by S. cerevisiae CDC25. All of these structural elements are conserved with PLC210 except for a difference in the number of the RA domains, confirming that we identified a human homolog of PLC210. As observed with PLC210, this protein lacks a PH domain and an EF-hand domain, both of which are invariably present in all the known human PLC isoforms (Fig. 1 A). The observations led us to propose that this protein defines a novel class of human PI-PLC, designated PLCε. The PLCε mRNA was 7.6 kb in size and detected in various fetal and adult human tissues, such as brain, muscle, and lung (data not shown). The PI-PLC activity was confirmed by using recombinant full-length PLCε expressed in Sf9 insect cells. Purified PLCε specifically hydrolyzed PIP2 with a specific activity of 1.35 μmol/min/mg protein, which was comparable with that of PLCδ1, 304 nmol/min/mg protein, obtained under the same assay condition. Like most of other PI-PLC isoforms, the PIP2-hydrolyzing activity of PLCε exhibited a dependence on the Ca2+ concentration, and the maximal activity was obtained around 10 μm Ca2+ (Fig.1 C). MBP-PLCε (2094–2303), encompassing the RA domain, was examined for association with Ha-Ras and Rap1A, which had been loaded with GTPγS or GDPβS. A dose-dependent association was observed with the GTP-bound forms of Ha-Ras and Rap1A but not with their GDP-bound forms (Fig.2 A). The association with Ras was further analyzed quantitatively by the yeast adenylyl cyclase inhibition assay (29Minato T. Wang J. Akasaka K. Okada T. Suzuki N. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20845-20851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A dose-dependent inhibition of Ha-Ras-dependent adenylyl cyclase activity was observed by purified PLCε (2094–2303) added into the reaction mixture (Fig.2 B). MBP-PLCε (2094–2303) had no effect on the Mn2+-dependent adenylyl cyclase activity, indicating that this protein exerted its effect by interacting with Ras but not with adenylyl cyclase (data not shown). We carried out this experiment in the presence of various concentrations of Ha-Ras and MBP-PLCε (2094–2303) to prove the competitive nature of the inhibition as described (29Minato T. Wang J. Akasaka K. Okada T. Suzuki N. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20845-20851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At each point of Ha-Ras concentration in the presence of MBP-PLCε (2094–2303), we obtained free Ha-Ras concentration available for adenylyl cyclase activation as that required for giving the same adenylyl cyclase activity in the absence of MBP-PLCε (2094–2303). A difference between the original and the free concentrations of Ha-Ras was regarded as that bound to MBP-PLCε (2094–2303), and a reciprocal of this value was plotted against a reciprocal of the free Ha-Ras concentration (Fig. 2 C). This gave a series of straight lines for each value of MBP-PLCε (2094–2303), which converged on the horizontal axis. The data indicated that MBP-PLCε (2094–2303) bound directly to Ha-Ras and competitively sequestered it from adenylyl cyclase. TheK d value for Ha-Ras was calculated from the point of intersection with the horizontal axis and determined to be approximately 40 nm, which is comparable with those of other Ras effectors (27Akasaka K. Tamada M. Wang F. Kariya K. Shima F. Kikuchi A. Yamamoto M. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5353-5360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The data also indicated that the maximal Ha-Ras binding capacity of PLCε (2094–2303), calculated from the point of intersection with the vertical axis (29Minato T. Wang J. Akasaka K. Okada T. Suzuki N. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20845-20851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was about 0.5 pmol of Ha-Ras bound to 1 pmol of MBP-PLCε (2094–2303). The interaction of the PLCε RA domain with Ha-Ras was also confirmed by the yeast two-hybrid assay (Table I). The mutations affecting Asn-26, Tyr-32, and Thr-35 specifically abolished the interaction of Ha-Ras with PLCε (2094–2303). Comparison with our past results obtained with other Ras effectors (21Shibatohge M. Kariya K. Liao Y. Hu C.-D. Watari Y. Goshima M. Shima F. Kataoka T. J. Biol.

PLCε (2094–2303) exhibited a positive interaction with Rap1A but not with other small GTP-binding proteins such as R-Ras, RalA, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 by the two-hybrid assay (data not shown). Furthermore, PLCε was co-immunoprecipitated with activated Ha-Ras, Ha-RasG12V, but not with Ha-RasG12V,Y32F, from the total cellular extract of COS-7 cells co-expressing them (Fig.2 D), demonstrating their in vivo association.Table IInteractions of Ha-Ras effector region mutants with PLCε and other effectorsHa-Ras mutantsPLCεPLC210Byr2Raf-1RalGDSAF-6G12V++++++G12V, N26G−−−−−−G12V, V29A++++++G12V, Y32F−−−+ND 1-aND, not determined.NDG12V, P34G++++−NDG12V, T35S−−−+−+G12V, E37G+++−++G12V, D38N+++−NDNDG12V, S39C++++−−The interactions were examined by the yeast two-hybrid assay. +, positive interaction; −, no interaction.

To examine whether the association with Ras has a function to recruit PLCε to the plasma membrane, we co-expressed FLAG-tagged PLCε with Ha-RasG12V in serum-starved COS-7 cells and examined its distribution in the membrane and cytosolic fractions. PLCε was predominantly localized in the cytosolic fraction when expressed alone (Fig. 3 A). However, co-expression with Ha-RasG12V caused a gross increment of the amount of PLCε in the membrane fraction. In contrast, co-expression with Ha-RasG12V,Y32F failed to affect the distribution of PLCε. Next, we took advantage of the GFP fusion and examined the intracellular localization of PLCε under a confocal laser microscope. GFP-PLCε was evenly distributed in the cytosol when expressed alone in the serum-starved COS-7 cells (Fig. 3 B,top panels). However, GFP-PLCε became enriched at the plasma membrane when co-expressed with Ha-RasG12V (Fig.3 B, middle panels). Again, Ha-RasG12V,Y32F was found to be incompetent (Fig.3 B, bottom panels). Similar results were obtained by using NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). These data taken together indicate that Ras associates with PLCε and induces its translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. We further investigated whether the PIP2-hydrolyzing activity of PLCε is regulated through interaction with Ras. Because simple mixing of GTP-bound Ha-Ras with purified PLCε had no effect on its activity (data not shown), we examined the effect of the Ras-induced membrane translocation, which was in principle expected to cause an increase of the PLCε activity by bringing it to the proximity of its substrate PIP2. To this end, we employed an in vitro reconstitution assay, in which post-translationally modified Ha-Ras and [3H]PIP2 were incorporated into liposomes and incubated with purified PLCε. As shown in Fig. 3 C, GTPγS-loaded Ha-Ras stimulated the PIP2-hydrolyzing activity of PLCε by approximately 2.4-fold. In contrast, no stimulation was observed with the GDPβS-loaded form. This result suggests that the Ras-dependent membrane translocation stimulates the PLCε activity. To further examine whether the Ras-dependent translocation of PLCε could be induced by a physiological stimulus, COS-7 cells expressing PLCε were stimulated with EGF and analyzed for the distribution of PLCε by immunoblotting. EGF induced transient membrane translocation of PLCε, starting from 5 min after the stimulation and terminating at 40 min (Fig.4 A, left panels). The EGF-stimulated membrane translocation was efficiently blocked by co-expression of the dominant-negative Ha-Ras mutant Ha-RasS17N (Fig. 4 A, right panels). Further, translocation of GFP-PLCε to the plasma membrane upon EGF stimulation was observed (Fig. 4 B). In addition, an enrichment of GFP-PLCε in the perinuclear region was also noticed (Fig. 4 B). We speculated that this perinuclear enrichment was mediated by Rap1A because Rap1A was reported to be activated upon EGF stimulation (32Zwartkruis F.J.T. Wolthuis R.M.F. Nabben N.M.J.M. Franke B. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5905-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and because Rap1A was found to be associated with PLCε (Fig. 2 A). In fact, we observed co-localization of GFP-PLCε with Rap1AG12V in this region (Fig.4 C). Moreover, following EGF stimulation, GFP-PLCε was translocated to the plasma membrane in cells overexpressing wild type Ha-Ras, whereas in wild type Rap1A-overexpressing cells, GFP-PLCε was translocated to the perinuclear region (Fig. 4 D). Taken together, EGF may direct translocation of PLCε to different subcellular regions through Ras or Rap1A. We have discovered yet another class of PI-PLC, PLCε, which is characterized by the presence of the CDC25-like domain and the RA domain as well as by the absence of PH and EF-hand domains. As predicted from the close homology at the X, Y, and C2 domains with the known PLC isoforms, PLCε exhibited a Ca2+-dependent PI-PLC activity with the maximal activity observed at 10 μm Ca2+. PLCε possessed the RA domain, which exhibited a specific binding activity to GTP-bound Ha-Ras with an affinity comparable with those of other Ras-effector proteins (27Akasaka K. Tamada M. Wang F. Kariya K. Shima F. Kikuchi A. Yamamoto M. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5353-5360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This binding was abolished by specific mutations in the effector region, which constitutes a major interface for interaction with Ras effectors (4Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Further, it was shown that Ras could induce translocation of PLCε to the plasma membrane and stimulate its PIP2-hydrolyzing activity in the liposome reconstitution assay. These observations indicate that PLCε functions as a direct downstream effector of Ras. Considering that full-length PLCε expressed in Sf9 cells by itself possessed a higher specific activity than PLCδ and could not be activated in vitro by mixing with Ras, the association with Ras is likely to induce activation of PLCε through its recruitment to the plasma membrane, where its substrate PIP2 exists. This mechanism is similar to those observed for other Ras effectors, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (8Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) and RalGDS (9Kishida S. Koyama S. Matsubara K. Kishida M. Matsuura Y. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2899-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Ras has another role of directly activating PLCε as observed for Raf-1 (7Morrison D.K. Cutler Jr., R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The physiological function of PLCε remains to be elucidated. The observed membrane recruitment of PLCε by EGF treatment suggests that PLCε may be involved in signal transduction from growth factor receptors. In mammalian cells, an increase in PI-PLC activity upon treatment with growth factors has been largely attributed to the activation of PLCγ (1Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). However, the observation that the rate of phosphoinositide turnover in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells was three times that in untransformed cells implied a persistent stimulation of PI-PLC in these cells (33Fleischman L.F. Chahwala S.B. Cantley L. Science. 1986; 231: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Further, injection of anti-PI-PLC antibody has been shown to inhibit Ras-induced mitogenesis (34Smith M.R. Liu Y.L. Kim H. Rhee S.G. Kung H.F. Science. 1990; 247: 1074-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the possibility that an as yet unidentified species of PI-PLC regulated by Ras may play a role in mammalian cell proliferation, although they might be explained by accessory events accompanying the Ras-induced transformation such as autocrine stimulation of receptors coupled to the known PI-PLCs. Our present findings suggest that they might be accounted for by PLCε. PLCε binds not only to Ras but also to Rap1A as shown in Fig.2 A. Furthermore, Rap1A may mediate translocation of PLCε to the perinuclear region in response to EGF (Fig. 4). Considering that Rap1A (35Beranger F. Goud B. Tavitian A. de Gunzburg J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1606-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 36Matsubara K. Kishida S. Matsuura Y. Kitayama H. Noda M. Kikuchi A.

Nature. 1993; 364: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) were reported to be localized at the Golgi apparatus, PLCε, downstream of Rap1A, may have some role in the regulation of Golgi functions mediated by protein kinase C. Further analysis of the function of PLCε may reveal its unique role in some cellular phenomena."

These results cannot be explained simply on the basis of Franck-Condon factors. The large-amplitude vibrational motion associated with molecules in high vibrational states strongly modulates the energetic driving force of the electron transfer reaction.

Here we describe the founding member of a novel, structurally distinct fourth family of PI-PLC.

Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar). There are three established families of PLC termed β (∼150 kDa), γ (∼145 kDa), and δ (∼ 85 kDa) (3Rhee S.G. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Lee S.Y. Science. 1989; 244: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). All three families of the PI-PLC family are able to recognize phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and to carry out the Ca2+-dependent hydrolysis of these inositol phospholipids. It is presumed that the primary substrate for hydrolysis is PIP2, which yields the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 releases intracellular Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum via interaction with a specific receptor located on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. DAG, as well as increased intracellular Ca2+, activate protein kinase C leading to a cascade of intracellular events including regulation of cellular growth, smooth muscle contraction, and cardiac hypertrophy (2Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar). The mode of regulation differs considerably for members of the different isoform families. The β isoforms are regulated by large heterotrimeric G proteins. After activation by agonists such as epinephrine, α1 adrenergic receptors are able to couple to Gα subunits from the Gq/G11 family and stimulate hydrolysis of phosphatidyl inositol lipids via PLC β isoforms. For some β isoforms, Gq alone is sufficient for activation, whereas for others the coordinated action of both Gq and βγ is necessary. The γ isoforms of PLC contain SH2 and SH3 domains; hence, they are activated by both receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. Until recently, the mode of regulation of the δ class was unknown. Work from our laboratory and that of others has determined that this class is regulated in vitro by lipid ligands and ionized free calcium (regulation by calcium via C2 domain is described by Lomasney et al.) 2J.

Activation of G protein-coupled receptors modulates various aspects of cellular growth and proliferation, processes that are primarily controlled by small Ras-related G proteins and their downstream effector, the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (8Bokoch G.M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). There appear to be multiple mechanisms involving heterotrimeric Gα and βγ subunits by which G protein-coupled receptors regulate small monomeric G protein function (10Post G.R. Brown J.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Gβγ subunits can induce phosphorylation of the Shc adapter protein leading to association with the Grb2 docking protein and eventual stimulation of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange activity (11Luttrell L.M.

Recently, a novel molecule, p115 RhoGEF, has been identified that serves as a direct link between the heterotrimeric Gα subunit Gα13 and the small G protein Rho (13Hart M.J. Jiang X.J. Kozasa T.

Gα13 stimulates the nucleotide exchange activity of p115 RhoGEF for Rho. p115 RhoGEF also serves as a GTPase-activating protein for Gα13 and Gα12. This is the first example of a protein that is able to directly link large and small G protein pathways. In this report we identify a novel fourth class of PI-PLC that we designate PLCε and demonstrate that PLCε interacts with large and small G proteins, although it is very different from p115 RhoGEF. A computer search of the human GenBankTM expressed sequence tag (EST) data base was conducted using three relatively short amino acid sequences from the conserved X and Y domains of the mammalian PLCs. An EST clone, zb59f12.s1, showed a high degree of homology and contained a putative open reading frame. Screening of a human placental cDNA library with the EST cDNA probe yielded a larger (3.0 kilobases) but still incomplete cDNA fragment. The full-length PLCε cDNA was generated by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends utilizing the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). The cDNA was reverse transcribed from poly(A)+ mRNA obtained from human heart (CLONTECH), using the cDNA synthesis primer provided with the kit. The PCR amplification was carried out using adaptor primer 1 (5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) and a gene specific reverse primer, 5′-TCCACCGTCTGCCACCAAACAACTCCACA-3′. The first round PCR was performed according to the recommendations of the manufacturer of 94 °C for 1 min, five cycles at 94 °C for 5 s and 72 °C for 4 min, another five cycles at 94 °C for 5 s and 70 °C for 4 min, followed by 25 cycles at 94 °C for 5 s and 68 °C for 4 min. The second round of PCR was performed under the same conditions using a 1:200 dilution of the first round PCR amplification mixture as the template, adaptor primer 2 (5′-ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC-3′) and a nested gene-specific primer (5′-AGCAGCGGGCAGAGAGGTGTGTGTCC-3′). Southern blot analysis using an end-labeled internal oligonucleotide (5′-TGTCAACAGCATCTTTCAGGTCATCC-3′) 5′ from the PCR primers confirmed that the PCR product contained the expected sequence. The PCR product was subcloned into the PCR2.1 TA cloning vector (InVitrogen) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Positive clones were identified by hybridizing filter lifts with the same labeled oligonucleotide that was described for the Southern blots. Clones containing the expected size DNA fragment were then sequenced along both strands using the Taq dye terminator method at the University of Georgia Molecular Genetics Facility, Department of Genetics, using Applied Biosystems 373 and 377 automatic sequencers. The entire hPLCε cDNA was obtained from heart cDNA by PCR using the following primers: 5′-ATGGTTTCAGAAGGAAGTGCAGCAGGAA-3′ (sense) and 5′- TCACTGTCGGTAATCCATTGTGTCACTGG-3′ (antisense). The PLCε cDNA was subcloned in-frame into pBluescript KS+. The sequence of the inserted DNA was determined as previously mentioned. The phosphodiesterase-deficient mutant of hPLCε, PLCε H1144L, was generated by changing the histidine residue at position 1144 to leucine using the QuickChange Kit (Stratagene). Briefly, the fragment of PLCε containing the mutation was amplified withPfu Turbo Polymerase (Stratagene) using sense (5′-GCTTGACGGCGCCTCCGG-3′) and antisense (5′-CTACCCTACGGGTAGTAAATAGAACCTGTATGCGACTGTTGGTTC-3′) primers containing the mutation changing the histidine (CAT) to a leucine (CTT). The PCR was performed according to the recommendations of the manufacturer of 95 °C for 30 s, 12 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 1 min at 55 °C and 4 min at 68 °C. A second fragment overlapping the first was amplified using the sense primer, 5′-GATGGGATGCCCATCATTTATCTTGGACATACGCTGACAACCAAG-3′ and an antisense primer (5′-AACGGGGAGGGGGCACGG-3′) corresponding to pcDNA3 vector, 3′ from the multiple cloning site of the vector. The PCR was also performed according to the recommendations of the manufacturer of 95 °C for 30 s, 12 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 1 min at 55 °C, and 6 min at 68 °C. The overlapping products were then used to amplify the entire PLCε cDNA from nucleotide1278–6507 using the sense primer 5′-GCTTGACGGCGCCTCCGG-3′ and the antisense primer corresponding to the vector just 3′ of the multiple cloning site. The PCR conditions were 95 °C for 30 s, 12 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 10 min at 68 °C. After ligation and plasmid preparation, the mutant insert was digested with SacII and XbaI. The mutated fragment was gel purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and ligated into pcDNA3 in place of the wild type fragment. The sequence was then verified for the presence of the H1144L mutation and the absence of any additional mutations. Human multiple-tissue Northern blot I and blot IV membranes (CLONTECH) containing approximately 2 mg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane were probed with full-length cDNA of hPLCε or β-actin according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 30 ng of hPLCε or β-actin were random-primed with [α-32P]dCTP (<6000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the Prime-It II random primer labeling kit (Stratagene). Unincorporated radionucleotide was removed from the probe by using Bio-Spin 30 chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). The radiolabeled probes were then denatured by boiling for 5 min and placed on ice. Membranes were prehybridized in 15 ml of Express hyb solution (CLONTECH) with continuous shaking at 68 °C for 1 h. The prehybridization buffer was replaced with 10 ml of fresh ExpressHyb solution containing the radiolabeled probe. After a 1-h incubation at 68 °C with continuous shaking, the blots were quickly rinsed several times with 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS at room temperature and then washed twice for 10 min at room temperature in the same buffer. This was followed by two 20-min washes with fresh 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C and continuous shaking. The blots were then wrapped in plastic wrap and exposed to HyperFilm MP x-ray film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at −80 °C with two intensifying screens for 4–24 h before developing the film. Blots exposed to multiple probes were stripped of the first probe as suggested by the manufacturer's protocols. The hPLCε cDNA was subcloned in-frame into the unique HindIII andNotI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (InVitrogen) downstream of the cytomegalovirus promotor. A Kozak consensus sequence (TAAT) and a Myc tag (5′-ATGGAGCAGAAGCTGATCAGCGAGGAGGACCTG-3′) were incorporated in frame before the start codon. Plasmids were purified for transfection using Qiagen kits. TSA201 cells were cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing glutamine, high glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 50 mg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were transfected with Myc-hPLCε or pcDNA3 empty vector using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions with slight modifications. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Samples were subjected to 6% or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose as described previously (15Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12846-12852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). hPLCε was detected by Western blot analysis using a primary anti-Myc tag antibody (InVitrogen). Gα* subunits were detected using specific anti-Gα antibodies. Alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (IgG) was used for detection. TSA201 cells were transfected with either pcDNA3 vector (control), hPLCε, hPLCε H1144L, Gαs*, Gαi*, Gα12*, Gα13* cDNA, or Ras (2 mg/35-mm plate) alone or in combination using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc). To maintain uniform amount of transfected DNA, empty vector was added to the transfection mixture when necessary. The cells were labeled with [3H]myo-inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 24 h and harvested 48 h after transfection. The amount of inositol phosphates (inositol 1-phosphate, inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, and IP3) was determined using anion exchange chromatography (16Martin T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14816-14822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The percentage of PI hydrolyzed is expressed as the total inositol phosphates formed relative to the amount of [3H]myo-inositol incorporated into the phospholipid pool. TSA201 cells were transfected with either vector (control) or hPLCε cDNA (12 mg DNA/100-mm plate). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm leupeptin, 1 mm aprotinin, and 1 mm pepstatin). Cytosolic and particulate fractions were isolated as described previously (15Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12846-12852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Cytosolic and membrane fractions were then assayed for PLC activity using a vesicle assay previously described with slight modification (17Kim M.J. Min D.S. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3618-3624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Substrate was provided as mixed phospholipid vesicles containing phosphotidylinositol-4,5-bis phosphate, PIP2 (28 mm), and phosphatidylethanolamine (280 mm) in a ratio of 1:10 with 25,000- 35,000 cpm of [3H]PIP2/assay. PLC assays were performed at 37 °C for varying time periods in a mixture (70 ml) containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 3 mmEGTA, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 4 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml acetylated bovine albumin, 1.6 mmsodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm CaCl2 The reactions were started by addition of the transfected cell membranes and terminated by adding 350 μl of chloroform/methanol/concentrated HCl (500:500:3, v/v/v). The samples were vortexed, and 100 μl of 1m HCl containing 5 mm EGTA was added. Phases were separated by centrifugation and assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. TSA201 cells were co-transfected (12 mg DNA/100 mm plate) with vector, hPLCε, hPLCε H1144L, or RasGRF2 in combination with HA-tagged MAP kinase (2 mg). 24 h after transfection the cells were serum starved over night. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection as described previously with slight modifications (18Zu Y.L. Ai Y. Gilchrist A. Labadia M.E. Sha'afi R.I. Huang C.K. Blood. 1996; 87: 5287-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.) and lysed by addition of one volume 10× MAP kinase lysis buffer (5.5% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride, 0.7 mg/ml pepstatin A, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 20 mmsodium orthovanadate, and 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate) to 10 volumes phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 10,000 ×g. Activated MAP kinase was immunoprecipitated by incubating the cells for 2 h with anti-HA antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., 0.4 mg/ml). At the end of the incubation period precleared protein A beads (50% slurry) were added, and the samples were rotated 2 h at 4 °C. The ability of MAP kinase to phosphorylate myelin basic protein was measured following the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Protein samples were separated on 6% (PLCε and H1144L) and 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose at room temperature for 1 or 2 h at 5 or 15 V, respectively, using a semidry transfer cell (Bio-Rad). The HA monoclonal antibody (clone 12CA5; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to detect HA-MAP kinase, anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) was used to detect FLAG-tagged RasGRF2, and anti-Myc antibody (InVitrogen) was used to detect hPLCε and the H1144L mutant. The horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse antibody (1:2,000; Sigma) was used as the secondary antibody. The blots were developed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). TSA201 cells were transiently co-transfected as previously mentioned with either control plasmid (pcDNA3), hPLCε, hPLCε H1144L, or RasGRF2 and Ha-Ras. The cells were serum-starved for 24 h. 48 h after transfection the cells from a 10-cm dish were lysed and scraped in 1 ml of RIPA buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 8 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei. The desired amount of bacterial lysate containing the expressed GST-Ras-binding domain (GST-RBD) of Raf1 (prepared as described by de Rooij and Bos (19de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar)) was thawed on ice and incubated with glutathione-agarose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were isolated by centrifugation and washed three times with RIPA buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. Cell lysates were added to GST-RBD precoupled to glutathione-agarose beads and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with RIPA buffer, and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. GTP bound Ras was identified by precipitation with GST-Raf RBD followed by immunoblotting as described previously by de Rooij and Bos (19de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The protein samples were separated on 6% (PLCε and H1144L) and 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose at room temperature for 1 h at 5 V using a semidry transfer cell (Bio-Rad). The monoclonal antibody Y13–259 (1:500, Transduction Labs) was used to detect Ras and anti-Myc tag antibody was used to detect hPLCε and the H1144L mutant. The horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse antibody (1:2,000, Sigma) was used as the secondary antibody. The blot was developed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). X and Y domains are regions of ∼170 and ∼260 amino acids, respectively, which share 60% to 40% amino acid identity among all PLC isoforms. The X and Y domains are necessary for phosphodiesterase activity of PLC. We selected three relatively short amino acid sequences from the conserved X and Y domains to use in a BLAST search. The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is an extremely powerful tool that allows one to simultaneously search multiple nucleotide sequence data bases. Using the BLAST server at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, we were able to identify an EST clone that partially encoded for a novel PLC isoform. Using the EST cDNA as a probe, a human placental cDNA library was screened yielding a larger but still incomplete cDNA. A full-length cDNA clone was ultimately generated with 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR using human heart mRNA as template that we termed PLCε. The full-length cDNA (Fig.1 A) possesses an open reading frame of 6.05 kilobases encoding a 1994-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 230,000, making this the largest PLC isolated to date. The next largest would be a member of the β family at ∼1300 amino acids and ∼150 kDa. Hybridization of human multiple tissue Northern blots with PLCε cDNA revealed a ∼7.5-kilobase message corresponding to PLCε expressed in a wide variety of tissues including brain, lung, kidney, testis, and colon with highest expression detected in the heart (Fig.2). An additional transcript of larger size (∼9.5 kilobases) could be observed in most tissues, suggesting the possibility of an alternatively spliced form of PLCε or differential polyadenylation. Results from Southern blotting indicate that isoforms likely do not exist (data not shown).Figure 2Tissue distribution of hPLCε mRNA. Multiple human tissue Northern blots were analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each lane contains approximately 2 mg of poly(A)+ RNA. Blots were hybridized with the full-length cDNA or β-actin probe. The hybridized membrane was exposed to x-ray film for 24 h. kb, kilobases.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Structural analysis reveals that PLCε contains the conserved catalytic X and Y domains, thus identifying this isoform conclusively as a Pl-PLC (Fig. 1 B). Like members of the three other PLC families, PLCε also contains the regulatory C2 domain. Unlike other eukaryotic PLCs, PLCε appears not to contain a pleckstrin homology domain. A phylogenetic comparison of all known mammalian PLC isoforms (Fig. 1 C) demonstrates that PLCε shares little homology with other PLC families (β, γ, and δ) and therefore constitutes a distinct family of PLCs. PLCε is most similar to PLC210, a largely uncharacterized isoform from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (20Shibatohge M. Kariya K. Liao Y. Hu C.D. Watari Y. Goshima M. Shima F. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6218-6222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). PLC210 was first identified by open reading frame prediction of genomic sequences generated from the C. elegans genome sequencing project. Although there are significant similarities, human PLCε also differs considerably from PLC210. PLCε is considerably larger than PLC210 (∼200 amino acids) and differs extensively in the primary structure of the C terminus and portions of the N terminus. We predict that the C terminus of PLCε will mediate protein-protein interactions that are completely different from those of PLC210. Interestingly, both PLCε and PLC210 share structural domains that are not present in any other PLC, further suggesting the existence of a novel PLC family. Both PLCs contain a Ras binding motif denoted as the RA domain (21Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Although the functional role of RA domains is presently unknown, a recent report has demonstrated that PLC210 binds to Ha-Ras via this domain, suggesting a possible role of this isoform in Ras signaling (20Shibatohge M. Kariya K. Liao Y. Hu C.D. Watari Y. Goshima M. Shima F. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6218-6222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A number of other RA domain-containing proteins such as RalGDS and RGL are also known to bind to Ras (21Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). PLCε has two RA domains at the C terminus (amino acids 1688–1792 and 1813–1916), suggesting that it might interact with the effector region of Ras (Fig. 1 B). PLCε also contains domains in the N terminus, which suggests that it may interact with small G proteins of the Ras superfamily. Very significant homology (p < 0.00001) is found with aimless RasGEF from Dictyostelium, CDC25 RasGEF from yeast (both Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), human RasGEF homolog Sos1, human RasGEF H-GRF55, and son-of-sevenless RasGEF from mouse. The area of homology is encompassed by the RasGEF catalytic domain signature (G/A/P)CVP(F/Y)X 4(L/I/M/F/Y)X(D/N)(L/I/V/M) PROSITE121 (22Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). No other eukaryotic PLC contains these Ras binding motifs. This strongly suggests that PLCε activates Ras signal transduction pathways. Western blot analysis of cell lysates from TSA201 cells (a clone of human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing simian virus 40 large T antigen) revealed the presence of a single protein of approximately 230 kDa from cells transfected with PLCε cDNA inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 but not from control cells (Fig.3 A) (23Margolskee R.F. McHendry-Rinde B. Horn R. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 906-911PubMed Google Scholar). The observed apparent molecular mass of 230 kDa is consistent with the predicted molecular mass of PLCε. Extensive PLCε immunoreactivity resides in the particulate fraction of transfected TSA201 cells (data not shown) similar to eukaryotic PLCβ isoforms but unlike PLCγ and PLCδ isozymes that are primarily localized in cytosolic fractions (24Kim C.G. Park D. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21187-21192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 25Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. Cho K.S. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6649-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). PLCε has Pl-PLC activity, measured by its ability to hydrolyze exogenous PIP2, a selective substrate of PI-PLCs. As can be seen in Fig. 3 B, 10 μg of plasma membranes obtained from PLCε transfected TSA201 cells had a 2–3-fold (61–114 pmol PIP2 hydrolyzed) greater PLC activity over a 15-min incubation period than membranes of cells transfected with control vector (20–46 pmol of PIP2 hydrolyzed). As depicted in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1 C), the closest mammalian homolog of PLCε is PLCβ, an effector for heterotrimeric G protein Gα and βγ subunits. Currently, there are no identifiable motifs for proteins that bind to heterotrimeric G proteins. However, truncation of the terminal 112 amino acids of PLCβ1 (Gln1030–Leu1142) has been shown to totally abolish regulation of this isoform by Gαq, suggesting that the C terminus is necessary for Gα subunit interaction (26Wu D. Jiang H. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3704-3709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like PLCβ, PLCε has a long C terminus, suggesting the possibility for regulation by heterotrimeric G protei"
https://openalex.org/W1978568638,"Marcus theory has explained how thermal nuclear motions modulate the energy gap between donor and acceptor sites in protein electron transfer reactions. Thermal motions, however, may also modulate electron tunneling between these reactions. Here we identify a new mechanism of nuclear dynamics amplification that plays a central role when interference among the dominant tunneling pathway tubes is destructive. In these cases, tunneling takes place in protein conformations far from equilibrium that minimize destructive interference. As an example, we demonstrate how this dynamical amplification mechanism affects certain reaction rates in the photosynthetic reaction center and therefore may be critical for biological function."
https://openalex.org/W2080778311,"The signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) transcription factors become phosphorylated on tyrosine and translocate to the nucleus after stimulation of cells with growth factors or cytokines. We show that the Rac1 guanosine triphosphatase can bind to and regulate STAT3 activity. Dominant negative Rac1 inhibited STAT3 activation by growth factors, whereas activated Rac1 stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation on both tyrosine and serine residues. Moreover, activated Rac1 formed a complex with STAT3 in mammalian cells. Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated that STAT3 binds directly to active but not inactive Rac1 and that the interaction occurs via the effector domain. Rac1 may serve as an alternate mechanism for targeting STAT3 to tyrosine kinase signaling complexes."

Fatty acid levels are increased in liver during the metabolism of ethanol and might be expected to activate PPARα. However, ethanol inhibited PPARα activation of a reporter gene in H4IIEC3 hepatoma cells expressing alcohol-metabolizing enzymes but not in CV-1 cells, which lack these enzymes. Ethanol also reduced the ability of the PPARα ligand WY14,643 to activate reporter constructs in the hepatoma cells or cultured rat hepatocytes. This effect of ethanol was abolished by the alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole and augmented by the aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor cyanamide, indicating that acetaldehyde was responsible for the action of ethanol. PPARα/retinoid X receptor extracted from hepatoma cells exposed to ethanol or acetaldehyde bound poorly to an oligonucleotide containing peroxisome proliferator response elements. This effect was also blocked by 4-methylpyrazole and augmented by cyanamide. Furthermore, in vitro translated PPARα exposed to acetaldehyde failed to bind DNA. Thus, ethanol metabolism blocks transcriptional activation by PPARα, in part due to impairment of its ability to bind DNA.

By balancing these processes, the liver handles large amounts of fat without accumulating triacylglycerol. Many homeostatic responses of the hepatocyte to free fatty acids (FFA)1 are modulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). FFA are endogenous ligands for PPARα (1Bocos C.

A. 1993; 90: 2160-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), and numerous genes involved in fat metabolism contain peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in their promoters. It has been suggested that this constitutes a feedback control system: elevated FFA activate PPARα, inducing a battery of enzymes (peroxisomal β-oxidation, mitochondrial β-oxidation, and microsomal fatty acid hydroxylation (which initiates ω-oxidation)) involved in FFA oxidation (5Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 6Johnson E.F. Palmer C.A. Griffen K.J. Hsu M-H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), which serve to reduce the level of FFA. However, in certain forms of liver disease, this fine balance is disrupted, and elevated levels of hepatocellular FFA and triacylglycerol occur. The most common liver disease in which fatty acid metabolism is deranged is alcoholic liver disease. Alcohol metabolism alters the intramitochondrial redox potential via generation of NADH by alcohol dehydrogenase. This impairs β-oxidation and tricarboxylic acid cycle activity (7Lieber C.S. Jones D.P. DeCarli L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1965; 44: 1009-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), resulting in elevated FFA, increased formation of triacylglycerol, and increased rates of very low density lipoprotein synthesis and secretion (8Grunnet N. Kondrup J. Dich J. Alcohol Alcoholism Suppl. 1987; 1: 257-261PubMed Google Scholar, 9Grunnet N. Kondrup J. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1986; 10: 64S-68SCrossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, the fatty liver persists despite attenuation of the altered redox state after chronic ethanol administration (10Salaspuro M.P. Shaw S. Jayatilleke E. Ross W.A. Lieber C.S. Hepatology. 1981; 1: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Fatty liver is not necessarily benign; the development of liver injury in a rat model is clearly dependent upon the amount and type of fat in the diet (11Polvarapu R. Spitz D.R. Sim J.E.

Furthermore, a number of other compounds, including valproic acid, amiodarone, and perhexilene, are postulated to cause liver injury by way of inhibition of β-oxidation (15Fromenty B. Pessayre D.

Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 764-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Thus, several lines of evidence suggest that liver injury may occur when fatty acid oxidation or esterification and export are inadequate. One would predict that ethanol consumption would induce the PPARα battery of proteins by elevating intracellular fatty acid levels. Although alcohol consumption resulted in peroxisomal proliferation in humans (17DeCraemer D. Pauwels M. Van den Branden C. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1996; 20: 908-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and alcohol feeding of rats induced cytochrome P450 4A1 (lauryl ω-hydroxylase (13Ma X. Baraona E. Lieber C.S. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 1247-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)) and liver fatty acid binding protein (18Pignon J.P. Bailey N.C. Baraona E. Lieber C.S. Hepatology. 1987; 7: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), other typical responses to peroxisome proliferators were impaired by ethanol. The excretion of dicarboxylic fatty acids was increased in alcohol-fed animals (13Ma X. Baraona E. Lieber C.S. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 1247-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), due to increased lauryl hydroxylase activity but failure of induction of acyl-CoA oxidase (19Panchenko L.F. Pirozhkov S.V. Popova S.V. Antonenkov V.D. Experientia. 1987; 43: 580-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity, the gene for which has a PPRE in its proximal promoter (20Carter M.E. Gulick T. Moore D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was reported to be decreased by ethanol feeding (21Rabinowitz J.L. Staeffen J. Hall C.L. Brand J.G. Alcohol. 1991; 8: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, chronic ethanol feeding apparently does not activate a full PPARα response. One group has reported that PPARα mRNA was decreased in the livers of rats chronically fed alcohol via gastric lavage and that several PPAR-inducible enzymes were not increased in these animals (22Wan Y.J. Morimoto M. Thurman R.G. Bojes H.K. French S.W. Life Sci. 1995; 56: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that fatty liver and steatohepatitis, hallmarks of alcoholic liver injury, are also observed in both PPARα (23Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W Kroetz D.L.

We therefore examined the effect of ethanol on the function of PPARα in transfected cells. Most chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Trypsin and tissue culture media were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum charcoal-stripped of lipids was purchased from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). All radioisotopes were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. PPRE3-tk-luciferase (containing three copies of the PPRE from the acyl-CoA oxidase gene ligated to a herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter upstream of the luciferase gene (25Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar)) and the expression plasmids for murine PPARα, -δ, and -γ were the kind gifts of Dr. Ronald Evans (Salk Institute) (26Kliewer S.A Forman B.M. Blumberg B. Ong E.S. Borgmeyer U. Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7355-7359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). pALDH3′-BLCAT was used as an hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4)-responsive reporter and was described previously (27Stewart M.J. Dipple K.M. Estonius M. Nakshatri H. Everett L.M. Crabb D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1399: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids for apolipoprotein regulatory protein 1 (ARP-1) and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF) were from Dr. H. Nakshatri (Indiana University), and that for HNF-4 was from Dr. Frances Sladek (University of California, Irvine). All cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 63 μg/ml penicillin G. The day before transfection, the cells were plated at 106 cells/100-mm dish. For studies on PPARα and -γ, the cells were transfected with 10 μg of reporter plasmid (PPRE3-tk-luciferase), 20 μg of receptor expression plasmid, and 5 μg of pSV2CAT (as an internal control for transfection efficiency) by calcium phosphate precipitation (28Gorman C.M. Merlino G.T. Willinham M.C. Pastan I. Howard B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6777-6781Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). For studies on HNF-4, the reporter contained four copies of an HNF-4 response element from the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 promoter cloned in pBL2CAT (28Gorman C.M. Merlino G.T. Willinham M.C. Pastan I. Howard B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6777-6781Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar) and the internal control was SV40-luciferase. For studies on ARP-1 and COUP-TF, the reporter was SV40-luciferase (which is activated by these two orphan receptors (29Everett L.M. Crabb D.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 70: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)), and because of problems with effects of these receptors on other promoters, the activity was expressed per μg of cell extract protein. Four hours later, the cells were exposed to phosphate-buffered saline containing 15% glycerol for 3 min. The cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh modified Eagle's medium with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum was added. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 150 μl of a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 2 mmEDTA, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100. Fifty microliters of cell extract was incubated with luciferase assay reagent based on the original protocol of deWet (30de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was measured as described previously (31Crabb D.W. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The conversion of chloramphenicol to its acetylated products was quantified on an AMBIS β-scanner. Primary hepatocyte suspensions were isolated from male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Laboratory Animals for Research, Indianapolis, IN) as described previously (32Gautam A. Nguyen K. Hepatology. 1987; 7: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 33Graf J.A. Gautam A. Boyer J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6516-6520Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50–100 mg/kg body weight), their portal veins were cannulated with a 16-gauge catheter, and the livers were perfused with Ca2+-, Mg2+-free Hanks' A solution, followed by Hanks' B solution containing Ca2+, Mg2+, and 0.05% collagenase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Livers were then excised, minced, and passed through nylon mesh filters, and the resultant hepatocytes were suspended in culture medium. Viability of the hepatocytes exceeded 90% by trypan blue exclusion. These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2.4 g/liter of sodium bicarbonate, 10 mm glucose, 1 μm each dexamethasone and thyroxine, 1 nm insulin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. They were transfected 4 h after plating by calcium phosphate precipitation according to the method of Ginot (34Ginot F. Decaux J.F. Cognet M. Berbar T. Levrat F. Kahn A. Weber A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours later, the cells were treated with 100 μm WY14,643 for an additional 24 h before they were harvested for assay of reporter enzymes as described above. Nuclear proteins were isolated from cultured cells based on a micropreparation method (35Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). The nuclear extract was suspended in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. PPARs and RXRα were synthesized using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega in vitro transcription/translation kit). The production of protein of the expected molecular weight was monitored by labeling with [35S]methionine and autoradiography. Aliquots of the translation reaction were used without further purification. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed by radiolabeling double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the peroxisome proliferator response element of the acyl-CoA oxidase gene. Nuclear extracts (3–5 μg) or reticulocyte lysates (1–2 μl) were incubated with 1–2 μg of nonspecific competitor DNA (poly(dIC)) in binding buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, and 7% (v/v) glycerol on ice for 15 min. Where indicated, specific competitor oligonucleotides were added before the addition of labeled probe and incubated for 15 min on ice. For supershift assays, antibodies were added, and the mixture was incubated an additional 1–2 h. Labeled probe (20,000 cpm) was added last, and the reaction was incubated an additional 15 min on ice. Reaction mixtures were electrophoresed on a nondenaturing 4% acrylamide gel and subjected to autoradiography. Anti-PPARα antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-RXR was donated by Drs. C. Rochette-Egly and P. Chambon. Nuclear extracts (20 μg of protein) were fractionated in an 8% SDS-PAGE gel and electroblotted to nitrocellulose filters. PPARα was visualized using antiserum from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Detection of the protein bands was performed using the Amersham ECL kit. The activity of a PPARα-responsive reporter gene (PPRE3-tk-luciferase, containing three copies of the PPRE from the acyl-CoA oxidase gene) was used as an index of PPARα function in CV-1 and H4IIEC3 hepatoma cells with or without co-transfected PPARα (Table I). These cells contain low amounts of PPARα protein on Western blots (Fig.2 B, lane 2), but both cell lines contained immunoreactive retinoid X receptor (RXR; Ref. 36Galli A. Stewart M.J. Dorris R. Crabb D.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 354: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the required dimerization partner for PPARα (25Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). An important difference between CV-1 and H4IIEC3 cells was the presence of enzymes capable of oxidizing ethanol in the latter cells (37Wolfla C.E. Ross R.A. Crabb D.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 263: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 38Crabb D.W. Stewart M.J. Xiao Q. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1995; 19: 1414-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Responses of the reporter were relatively small (no more than 2-fold induction) in the absence of co-transfected PPARα. Clofibrate markedly induced the reporter activity in CV-1 cells transfected with PPARα. In the hepatoma cells, the reporter activity was much less dependent on the presence of clofibrate (36Galli A. Stewart M.J. Dorris R. Crabb D.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 354: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Ethanol at a physiologically relevant concentration of 20 mm inhibited clofibrate-independent and -stimulated activity of PPRE3-tk-luciferase by PPARα by over 50% in the hepatoma cells (Table I). Ethanol had no effect on basal or clofibrate-stimulated PPARα action in the CV-1 cells, either in the presence or absence of transfected PPARα.Table IEffect of ethanol on PPARα-induced reporter activity in CV-1 and H4IIEC3 cellsCell lineCV1H4IIEC3−PPARα+PPARα−PPARα+PPARαControl100382 ± 62100825 ± 112Clofibrate198 ± 412523 ± 425153 ± 351209 ± 363Ethanol107 ± 134628 ± 40357 ± 12399 ± 1651-aA statistically significant difference compared with no ethanol.Clofibrate + ethanol194 ± 1072361 ± 617100 ± 34582 ± 1741-bA statistically significant difference compared with clofibrate alone (p < 0.05 by paired t test).The cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate procedure with the reporter, PPRE3-tk-luciferase (26Kliewer S.A Forman B.M.

The cells were exposed to 20 mm ethanol and/or 1 mm clofibrate (dissolved in Me2SO as vehicle) from 24 to 48 h after transfection. Control cells were treated with vehicle alone. The concentration of ethanol in the medium was maintained by culturing the cells in an incubator containing a reservoir of 20 mmethanol in water. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were harvested for luciferase and chloramphenical acetyltransferase assays. In each experiment, duplicate plates were transfected, and the reporter activities were averaged. The results are shown as percentage of luciferase reporter activity in control cells (transfected with the reporter but not the PPARα expression plasmid) after correction for chloramphenical acetyltransferase activity of the internal control vector (means ± S.D. for three or four replications of each condition).1-a A statistically significant difference compared with no ethanol.1-b A statistically significant difference compared with clofibrate alone (p < 0.05 by paired t test).

The results are shown as percentage of luciferase reporter activity in control cells (transfected with the reporter but not the PPARα expression plasmid) after correction for chloramphenical acetyltransferase activity of the internal control vector (means ± S.D. for three or four replications of each condition). The effect of ethanol on the ability of the more potent and specific PPARα agonist WY14,643 was also tested. In duplicate experiments with H4IIEC3 cells transfected with the PPARα expression plasmid and reporter, WY14,643 at 100 μm increased reporter activity by 591 ± 49%. Ethanol (20 mm) reduced the basal activity of the reporter to 45 ± 4% and decreased the WY14,643-stimulated activity to 216 ± 134% of the control level (means ± S.E.). We also tested the effect of WY14,643 on primary hepatocyte cultures that were transfected with the PPAR reporter plasmid to see if ethanol also inhibited the activity of the endogenous rat PPARα. WY14,643 stimulated reporter activity by 433 ± 107. Ethanol (20 mm) reduced basal activity to 57 ± 3% and WY14,643-stimulated activity to 128 ± 32% of control levels (means ± S.E. for four replicate experiments). Thus, ethanol reduced the activity of the reporter by about 50% in both the basal and WY-14,643-stimulated cells, similar to the magnitude of the effect on clofibrate-stimulated activity. Further, the effect was also seen in primary cultures of hepatocytes, indicating that the rat PPARα is also sensitive to ethanol. To determine if this effect of ethanol was restricted to PPARα, additional transfection assays were performed using PPARγ, HNF-4, ARP-1, or COUP-TF. These receptors are structurally related to PPARα, and each recognizes DR-1 promoter elements. Compared with hepatoma cells transfected with PPARγ alone (n = 5, means ± S.E.), clofibrate increased activity of PPRE3-tk-luciferase by 189 ± 20%, while ethanol reduced activity to 60 ± 3% and reduced the clofibrate-stimulated activity to 154 ± 21%. These small differences were statistically significant. Transfection of the H4IIEC3 cells with an HNF-4 expression plasmid stimulated its reporter plasmid expression (pALDH3′-BLCAT containing four copies of an HNF-4 response element from the aldehyde dehydrogenase promoter) by 956 ± 159% in the absence and 1034 ± 109% in the presence of ethanol (n = 3, not significant). ARP-1 stimulated its reporter plasmid expression (SV40-luciferase (29Everett L.M. Crabb D.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 70: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)) by 8222 ± 1776% in the absence and 12,203 ± 6875% in the presence of ethanol (n = 4, not significant). COUP-TF stimulated its reporter plasmid expression (SV40-luciferase) by 10,408 ± 1092% in the absence and 9312 ± 3432% in the presence of ethanol (not significant, n = 4). The large errors observed in the transfections with ARP-1 and COUP-TF were related to the use of cellular protein for normalizing the data rather than an internal control plasmid (29Everett L.M. Crabb D.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 70: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of ethanol was relatively specific for PPARα, although the small effect on the γ isoform was studied further with in vitro translated receptor (see below). The alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole and the aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor cyanamide were then used to determine if the effect of ethanol on PPARα was dependent on its metabolism (Table II). Neither compound affected PPRE3-tk-luciferase activity in the hepatoma cells in control experiments. However, 4-methylpyrazole completely prevented the effect of ethanol on PPARα function, while cyanamide augmented the effect. This suggested that acetaldehyde generated from ethanol was responsible for the inhibition of PPARα action, and indeed, low levels of exogenous acetaldehyde (50–150 μm) inhibited PPRE3-tk-luciferase reporter activity, both in H4IIEC3 cells and CV-1 cells (TableIII). There was no visible evidence of toxicity to the cells of these doses of acetaldehyde. Because many biological effects of acetaldehyde have been attributed to modification of proteins (39Behrens U.H. Hoerner M. Lasker J.M. Lieber C.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 40Smith S.L. Jennett R.B. Sorrell M.F. Tuma D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of pyridoxal phosphate on ethanol inhibition of PPARα induction of the reporter. Pyridoxal phosphate has been reported to protect proteins from formation of Schiff bases with acetaldehyde by reversibly blocking lysyl residues (41Nomura F. Lieber C.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 100: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), even in whole cell models (42Casini A. Galli G. Salzano R. Rotella C.M. Surrenti C. J. Hepatol. 1993; 19: 385-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and thus is useful in understanding mechanisms of acetaldehyde effects. Treatment of the cells with 10 mm pyridoxal phosphate completely prevented the effect of ethanol (control activity = 970 ± 10, ethanol-treated cells = 454 ± 43, ethanol plus pyridoxal phosphate = 830 ± 49; activity represents percentage increase over the untransfected control cells as described for Table I; means ± S.E. for three replications), indicating that acetaldehyde-protein adduct formation may explain the inhibitory effect of ethanol metabolism.Table IIEffect of inhibitors of alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase on the effect of ethanol on PPARα-induced reporter activity in H4IIEC3 cellsConditionReporter activity (percentage of control)− Ethanol+ Ethanol%%Control1040 ± 104693 ± 672-aSignificant differences from the activity of the reporter in the control cells (p < 0.05 by paired t test).4-Methylpyrazole (0.1 mm)1034 ± 100993 ± 110Cyanamide (0.1 mm)1043 ± 113361 ± 542-aSignificant differences from the activity of the reporter in the control cells (p < 0.05 by paired t test).4-Methylpyrazole + cyanamide1071 ± 77The cells were transfected as described in Table 1 with the PPARα expression plasmid, internal control plasmid, and the PPRE3-tk-luciferase reporter; the inhibitors were added 24 h later, and the cells were exposed to ethanol (20 mm) where indicated, beginning at the same time.

https://openalex.org/W1967153587,"The class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) 4, 5, and 7 share a common structural organization, with a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain and an amino-terminal extension that mediates interactions with members of the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors. Association of these HDACs with MEF2 factors represses transcription of MEF2 target genes. MEF2-interacting transcription repressor (MITR) shares homology with the amino-terminal extensions of class II HDACs and also acts as a transcriptional repressor, but lacks a histone deacetylase catalytic domain. This suggests that MITR represses transcription by recruiting other corepressors. We show that the amino-terminal regions of MITR and class II HDACs interact with the transcriptional corepressor, COOH-terminal-binding protein (CtBP), through a CtBP-binding motif (P-X-D-L-R) conserved in MITR and HDACs 4, 5, and 7. Mutation of this sequence in MITR abolishes interaction with CtBP and impairs, but does not eliminate, the ability of MITR to inhibit MEF2-dependent transcription. The residual repressive activity of MITR mutants that fail to bind CtBP can be attributed to association with other HDAC family members. These findings reveal CtBP-dependent and -independent mechanisms for transcriptional repression by MITR and show that MITR represses MEF2 activity through recruitment of multicomponent corepressor complexes that include CtBP and HDACs.

Allis C.D. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Acetylation of the amino-terminal tails of core histones by histone acetyltransferases results in chromatin relaxation and transcriptional activation, whereas deacetylation of histones by histone deacetylases (HDACs)1is associated with transcriptional repression. Recruitment of histone acetyltransferases and HDACs by DNA-bound transcription factors results in the formation of multiprotein transcription regulatory complexes that confer cell type specificity and signal-dependent regulation to arrays of subordinate genes. There is also evidence that direct acetylation/deacetylation of certain transcription factors provides a mechanism for reversible regulation of transcription. HDACs can be divided into two classes, I and II, on the basis of size, sequence homology, and formation of distinct complexes. Class I includes HDACs 1, 2, and 3, which are expressed ubiquitously (2Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar, 3Yang W.M.

Class II includes HDACs 4, 5, 6, and 7, which contain a conserved domain of several hundred amino acids extending amino-terminal from the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain (6Grozinger C.M.

Class II HDACs are tissue-restricted, with especially high levels of expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and brain. MEF2-interacting transcription repressor (MITR) (11Sparrow D.B. Miska E.A.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5085-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), also called HDAC-related protein (HDRP) (12Zhou X. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), shares homology with the amino-terminal extension of class II HDACs, but lacks a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain. Class II HDACs and MITR/HDRP have been shown to interact with members of the MEF2 family of MADS (MCM1, Agamous, Deficiens, serum response factor) box transcription factors, resulting in transcriptional repression (7Miska E.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15594-15599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). MEF2 factors play central roles in the control of muscle differentiation and have been implicated in growth factor signaling and apoptotic pathways (reviewed in Ref. 15Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Thus, negative regulation of MEF2 activity by association with HDACs may inhibit growth and/or differentiation, depending on cell type and the presence of other cofactors for MEF2 and HDACs. While HDACs are presumed to inhibit transcription as a consequence of their deacetylase activity, the mechanism whereby MITR represses transcription is unclear. MITR has been shown to interact with HDAC1, which could account for its ability to repress MEF2-dependent transcription (11Sparrow D.B. Miska E.A. Langley E. Reynaud-Deonauth S. Kotecha S. Towers N. Spohr G. Kouzarides T. Mohun T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5085-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Consistent with this conclusion, the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin (TSA) has been reported to partially attenuate transcriptional repression by MITR (11Sparrow D.B. Miska E.A. Langley E. Reynaud-Deonauth S. Kotecha S. Towers N. Spohr G. Kouzarides T. Mohun T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5085-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, another study reported that TSA had no effect on transcriptional repression by MITR, concluding that its mechanism for repression did not involve other HDACs (12Zhou X. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Here we report that HDACs 4 and 5 and MITR associate with the transcriptional corepressor COOH-terminal binding protein (CtBP) via a CtBP-binding motif (P-X-D-L-R) conserved in HDACs 4, 5, and 7 and MITR. Mutation of this sequence abolishes association of CtBP with MITR and substantially diminishes, but does not eliminate, the transcriptional repression of basal as well as MEF2-dependent promoters by MITR. These results demonstrate that MITR and class II HDACs act as a bridge linking the CtBP corepressor to target transcription factors, such as MEF2, thereby establishing a multiprotein corepressor complex directed at specific downstream genes. A mouse 17-day embryo MATCHMAKER cDNA library (CLONTECH) was screened with GAL4-HDAC4 bait in the yeast two-hybrid system, as described previously (16Molkentin J.D. Lu J. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar). The bait contained amino acids 1–640 of human HDAC4 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Positive clones were subjected to specificity tests using the GAL4 DNA binding domain alone as bait. Those clones that were specific for interaction with GAL4-HDAC4 bait were sequenced. A mouse expressed sequence tag encoding MITR (GenBankTM accession number AV118321), identified by searching the data base, was used to screen a mouse embryonic day 10.5 cDNA library (Stratagene) for cDNAs encompassing the complete open reading frame. The deduced open reading frame of mouse MITR is 586 amino acids and shows 94 and 66% identity to human and Xenopus MITR proteins, respectively (11Sparrow D.B. Miska E.A. Langley E.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of mouse MITR has been deposited in the data base (GenBankTM accession number AF324492). 10T1/2, COS, and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. Transfections were performed using the lipid-based reagent Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and cells growing at a density of 5–10 × 105 cells/35-mm dish. Epitope-tagged derivatives of CtBP, MITR, HDAC4, and HDAC5, containing amino-terminal FLAG or Myc tags, were generated using the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). Expression plasmids for carboxyl-terminally FLAG-tagged HDAC1 (pBJ) and HDAC3 (pcDNA6) were kindly provided by Dr. Stuart Schreiber (Harvard). For GAL4-dependent reporter assays, 10T1/2 cells were cotransfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid under control of four GAL4 DNA binding sites and the thymidine kinase (tk) promoter, pMH100-tk-luc (17Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Chakravarti D. Lin R.J. Hassig C.A. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar), pM1-based expression vectors encoding MITR or MITR(DL-AS) fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain, and a CMV-lacZ (Invitrogen) plasmid to normalize for variable transfection efficiency. For MEF2-dependent transcription assays, 10T1/2 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid under control of three copies of a consensus MEF2 binding site, 3×MEF-luc, a pcDNA1-based expression plasmid (Invitrogen) for MEF2C, pcDNA3.1-based expression vectors encoding either MITR or MITR(DL-AS), and the CMV-lacZ plasmid. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured under conditions of linearity with respect to time and extract concentration. CtBP protein was translated in vitro using the TNT kit (Promega) and a pcDNA3.1-based expression plasmid encoding full-length mouse CtBP1. GST-HDAC and GST-MITR fusion proteins were expressed in the BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli using the pGEX-KG vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ten microliters of in vitrotranslated, [35S]methionine-labeled CtBP (∼10,000 cpm) were incubated with GST-HDAC4 and GST-MITR proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) in GST binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times in GST binding buffer. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, transiently transfected COS or 293T cells were harvested 48 h following transfection in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors. After brief sonication and removal of cellular debris by centrifugation, FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using anti-FLAG affinity resin (Sigma) and washed five times with lysis buffer. Alternatively, Myc-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using polyclonal anti-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz; A-14) and protein A-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with either a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz; 9E10) or a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma; M2). Proteins were visualized with a chemiluminescence system (Santa Cruz). HDACs 4, 5, and 7 are bipartite, with an amino-terminal region that contains a MEF2-binding motif, and a carboxyl-terminal catalytic region (Fig. 1 A). In previous studies, we (13Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Nicol R.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4070-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and others (7Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 8Wang A.H. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Pelletier N. Crosato M. Heng H.H. Th'ng J. Han J. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell.

This motif is also conserved in MITR/HDRP, which lacks a catalytic domain. To further investigate the functions of the amino-terminal extension of class II HDACs and MITR, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens using amino acids 1–640 of HDAC4 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain as bait (Fig. 1 A). Three strong positives obtained from a mouse 17-day embryo cDNA library corresponded to CtBP1, a widely expressed transcriptional corepressor (18Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 19Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Two independent cDNA clones encoded the entire 441-amino acid CtBP1 protein; the other encoded amino acids 25–441. These CtBP-GAL4 activation domain fusion proteins interacted specifically with the HDAC4 bait and not with the GAL4 DNA binding domain alone (see “Experimental Procedures”). Because CtBP has been shown to interact with the consensus motif P-X-D-L-S/R (20Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 21Sewalt R.G. Gunster M.J. van der Vlag J. Satijn D.P. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), we scanned the 640-amino acid region of HDAC4 used as bait and identified a potential CtBP-binding motif between residues 48 and 52 (Fig. 1 B). Similar sequences were also found in HDACs 5 and 7 and MITR (Fig. 1 B). The amino acid sequences surrounding this potential CtBP-binding motif were not conserved in the different HDACs or MITR. The possible association of CtBP with MITR and HDACs was tested further by coimmunoprecipitation assays from transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 2 A, HDACs 4 and 5, as well as MITR, were coimmunoprecipitated with CtBP. To further test the interaction of CtBP with HDACs and MITR, we performed binding assays with GST fusion proteins. As shown in Fig.2 B, a GST fusion protein containing amino acids 1–60 of HDAC4 (GST-HDAC4-(1–60)), including the CtBP-binding motif, interacted with [35S]methionine-labeled CtBP translated in vitro, whereas amino acids 49–223 of HDAC4 (GST-HDAC4-(49–223)), which contains a truncated CtBP-binding motif, did not interact with CtBP. GST-MITR and GST-HDAC5 also interacted with CtBP (Fig.2 B and data not shown). Residues 1–201 of MITR (GST-MITR-(1–201)) contained the CtBP-binding region, whereas residues 131–586 (GST-MITR-(131–586)) did not bind CtBP (Fig. 2 B). A further amino-terminal deletion mutant containing only the first 45 amino acids (GST-MITR-(1–45)) also interacted with CtBP. To determine specifically whether the P-X-D-L-R motif (residues 23–27) of MITR was responsible for all CtBP-binding activity, we mutated residues DL to AS, which has been shown previously to abolish CtBP binding to the E1a oncoprotein (20Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This mutant, GST-MITR-(1–201DL-AS) showed no CtBP binding activity (Fig.2 B). GST alone also showed no interaction with MITR or HDAC4, further establishing the specificity of the observed interactions. The results of the GST pulldown experiments are summarized in Fig. 2 C. The regions of MITR and HDAC5 responsible for recruitment of CtBP were also assayed by coimmunoprecipitation assays in transfected 293T cells. As observed in the GST binding assays, the interaction of MITR with CtBP required the CtBP-binding motif between residues 23 and 27 and was abolished by the DL-AS mutation of this motif (Fig. 2 D). In contrast, mutation of the corresponding region of HDAC5 (mutant HDAC5-(EL-AS)) did not prevent its association of CtBP (Fig.2 E). This result suggested that HDAC5 contained additional CtBP-binding motifs. Indeed, a deletion mutant containing residues 121–664, which lacked the CtBP consensus binding motif at the analogous position to that in MITR, also bound CtBP (Fig.2 E), indicating the presence of an additional CtBP-binding motif in this region of the protein. We conclude that CtBP is specifically recruited to MITR through interaction with the P-X-D-L-R motif, which is also conserved in the amino-terminal region of class II HDACs. However, additional regions of HDAC5 can also recruit CtBP. To investigate the potential significance of CtBP binding to MITR, we compared the repressive activity of wild-type MITR and MITR mutant DL-AS, which failed to bind CtBP. As shown in Fig.3 A, wild-type MITR fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain potently repressed transcription of a GAL4-dependent luciferase reporter linked to the highly active thymidine kinase promoter. GAL4-MITR(DL-AS) also repressed this reporter, but the level of repression was reduced by at least 50% over a 30-fold range of expression plasmid. Wild-type and mutant forms of MITR were expressed at comparable levels in transfected cells (Fig.2 D). Because MITR has been shown to repress MEF2-dependent transcription (11Sparrow D.B. Miska E.A. Langley E. Reynaud-Deonauth S. Kotecha S. Towers N. Spohr G. Kouzarides T. Mohun T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5085-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), we compared the abilities of wild-type MITR and MITR(DL-AS) to repress activation of a luciferase reporter linked to three tandem copies of the MEF2 consensus sequence. Consistent with the results obtained with GAL4-MITR fusions, the MITR(DL-AS) mutant was compromised in its ability to repress transcription, although it clearly retained repressive activity (Fig. 3 B). The ability of MITR(DL-AS) to repress transcription in the absence of CtBP binding suggests the existence of redundant, CtBP-independent mechanisms for MITR-mediated repression. Consistent with this, MITR has been shown to interact with HDAC1 (11Sparrow D.B. Miska E.A. Langley E. Reynaud-Deonauth S. Kotecha S. Towers N. Spohr G. Kouzarides T. Mohun T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5085-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed to determine whether MITR(DL-AS) retained the capacity to bind HDAC1. As shown in Fig.4 A, both wild-type MITR and MITR(DL-AS) efficiently associated with HDAC1 in transfected cells. Furthermore, both proteins interacted with another class I HDAC, HDAC3, as well as the class II HDACs 4 and 5. Homodimeric MITR complexes were also detected in this assay. These results demonstrate that MITR possesses the capacity to associate with multiple HDACs, independent of CtBP binding, and suggest the existence of CtBP-dependent and -independent mechanisms for transcriptional repression by MITR. The results of this study demonstrate that MITR and class II HDACs share homology in an amino-terminal CtBP-binding motif that recruits CtBP to enhance transcriptional repression. Mutations in this CtBP-binding motif that disrupt CtBP binding diminish the ability of MITR to repress transcription, but such mutants retain substantial repressive activity. Thus, we conclude that recruitment of CtBP by MITR contributes to transcriptional repression. However, maximal inhibition of transcription by MITR, as well as class II HDACs, likely involves the cooperative action of CtBP and deacetylase activity provided in trans by associated HDACs. Indeed, we show that MITR is able to physically associate with several different class I and II HDACs. CtBP1, first identified as a cellular protein that bound to the carboxyl-terminal region of the E1a oncoprotein (18Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 19Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

CtBP1 and the closely related CtBP2 are expressed in a wide range of tissues. The precise mechanism for transcriptional repression by CtBP is unclear. Other corepressors, such as NcoR and SMRT, repress transcription by recruiting HDACs (9Huang E.Y. Zhang J. Miska E.A. Guenther M.G. Kouzarides T. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 45-54PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar). CtBP1 has also been shown to interact with HDAC1 (27Sundqvist A. Sollerbrant K. Svensson C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and TSA has been shown to partially relieve repression by CtBP. However, other studies have found that promoters repressed by CtBP are insensitive to TSA (29Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of HDAC-independent mechanisms for repression by CtBP. The results of the present study provide the first demonstration of a direct interaction between CtBP and class II HDACs. Class II HDACs can physically associate with class I HDACs, and both types of HDACs can interact with CtBP. Thus, it is clear that each of these proteins has the capacity to serve as a bridge to the other, with the potential to generate repression complexes that are linked to DNA-bound transcription factors such as MEF2. In contrast to the ubiquitous expression of CtBP, MITR and class II HDACs are expressed predominantly in heart, skeletal muscle, and brain (6Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 30Fischle W. Emiliani S. Hendzel M.J. Nagase T. Nomura N. Voelter W. Verdin E. J. Biol.

While CtBP played only a partial role in MITR-mediated transcriptional repression in our assays, in other cell backgrounds, its contribution to the repressive activity of MITR could be greater, if for example other trans-acting HDACs were expressed at lower levels or were less active due to intracellular signals (13Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Nicol R.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4070-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). It is becoming increasingly clear that HDACs associate with a complex array of cell-specific and ubiquitous transcriptional activators and repressors to control gene expression of large sets of downstream genes. In this regard, a role for these multiprotein complexes in the regulation of cell differentiation is strongly supported by our recent demonstration that class II HDACs, including HDAC4 and HDAC5, potently repress the transcriptional program required for skeletal muscle development (34Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 35McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Lu J. Olson E.N. Nature. 2000; 408: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). This inhibitory action of HDAC is absolutely dependent on its association with MEF2 and can be overcome by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase signaling, which disrupts MEF2·HDAC complexes (13Lu J.

The technique exploits the effect of the classical Lorentz force on the motion of a tunneling electron and can be regarded as the momentum (k) space analog of scanning tunneling microscopy imaging. The images reveal the elliptical symmetry of the ground state and the characteristic lobes of the higher energy states.

The exploitation of host cell signaling pathways to the benefit of the pathogen is a phenomenon that deserves to be looked into in detail. We have tested the hypothesis that lipoarabinomannan (LAM) from the virulent species of Mycobacterium tuberculosis possesses the ability to modulate signaling pathways linked to cell survival. The Bcl-2 family member Bad is a proapoptotic protein. Phosphorylation of Bad promotes cell survival in many cell types. We demonstrate that man-LAM stimulates Bad phosphorylation in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K)-dependent pathway in THP-1 cells. Man-LAM activated PI-3K. LAM-stimulated phosphorylation of Bad was abrogated in cells transfected with a dominant-negative mutant of PI-3K (Δp85), indicating that activation of PI-3K is sufficient to trigger phosphorylation of Bad by LAM. Since phosphorylation of Bad occurred at serine 136, the target of the serine/threonine kinase Akt, the effect of LAM on Akt kinase activity was tested. Man-LAM could activate Akt as evidenced from phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 and by the phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate histone 2B. Akt activation was abrogated in cells transfected with Δp85. The phosphorylation of Bad by man-LAM was abrogated in cells transfected with a kinase-dead mutant of Akt. These results establish that LAM-mediated Bad phosphorylation occurs in a PI-3K/Akt-dependent manner. It is therefore the first demonstration of the ability of a mycobacterial virulence factor to up-regulate a signaling pathway involved in cell survival. This is likely to be one of a number of virulence-associated mechanisms by which bacilli control host cell apoptosis.

A variety of mechanisms contribute to the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosiswithin macrophages (1Fenton M.J. Vermeulen M.W. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 683-690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) including inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion (2Meresse, S., Steele-Mortimer, O., Moreno, E., Desjardin, M., Finlay, B., and Gorvel, J.-P.

M. tuberculosis produces large quantities of lipoarabinomannan (LAM).1 LAM can inhibit macrophage activation and triggering and represents a virulence factor contributing to the persistence of mycobacteria within macrophages. LAM is a complex molecule consisting of a phosphatidylinositol (PI) moiety that anchors a large mannose core to the mycobacterial cell wall (7Chatterjee D. Khoo K.-H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 8Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9272-9279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hunter S.W. Gaylord H. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12345-12351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mannose core consists of multiple branched, arabinofuranosyl side chains. M. tuberculosis and M. leprae modify the nonreducing end of the arabinofuranosyl chains with mannose residues yielding man-LAM, whereas rapidly growing mycobacterial species have nonreducing termini of two types, the linear Ara4 and the branched Ara6 motifs, thereby giving rise to ara-LAM (7Chatterjee D. Khoo K.-H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 10Khoo K.-H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol.

LAM exhibits a wide array of immunomodulatory functions including inhibition of interferon-γ-induced functions such as macrophage microbicidal and tumoricidal activity (11Sibley L.D. Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. Krahenbuhl J.L. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), scavenging of potentially cytotoxic oxygen free radicals (12Chan J. Fan X. Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. Bloom B.R. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1755-1761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of protein kinase C activity (13Chan, S. D., Fan, Hunter, S. W., Brennan, P. J., and Bloom, B. R. (1991)Google Scholar), and evocation of a number of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (14Barnes P.F. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. Rea T.H. Modlin R.L. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 1441-1446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The early response genes c-fos, KC, and JE are induced by ara-LAM but not by man-LAM (15Roach T.A. Barton C.H. Chatterjee D. Blackwell J.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 60: 1886-1896Google Scholar). The ability of man-LAM to impair responsiveness to interferon-γ and to attenuate tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-12 mRNA production through effects on the protein phosphatase SHP-1 has been suggested to be a major mechanism by which man-LAM promotes intracellular survival (16Knutson K.L. Hmaama Z. Herrera-Velit P. Rochford R. Reiner N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 645-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Despite the recent advances, the intracellular signaling following interaction of the mycobacterium with host cells and the role of LAM in these processes is incompletely understood. The survival of M. tuberculosis in macrophages probably involves more than one mechanism. In this study, we have tested whether LAM plays a role in triggering a signaling pathway that suppresses the intrinsic cell death machinery of phagocytic cells. The regulation of programmed cell death, apoptosis, is an exceptionally complicated process that involves a myriad of proteins. The family of proteins that includes Bcl-2 comprises members that are both antiapoptotic and those that are proapoptotic such as Bax and Bad. Bad interacts with Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, sequestering these proteins, and thus promotes apoptosis (17Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1888) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Bad at either of two sites, serine residues 112 and 136 (numbering based on the sequence of murine Bad) creates consensus sites for interaction with the 14-3-3 protein. Bad is then bound to 14-3-3 instead of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL, resulting in the liberation of the antiapoptotic proteins and promotion of cell survival. Interleukin-3 (18Yao R. Cooper G.N. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar) and other survival factors promote cell survival through their ability to stimulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) (19Yao R.

Akt/protein kinase B is the major downstream target of receptor tyrosine kinases that signal via the PI-3K. Activated protein kinase B has been implicated in glucose metabolism, transcriptional control, and the regulation of apoptosis in many cell types (30Galetic I. Andjelkovic M. Meier R. Brodbeck D.

The Ca2+-activated protein phosphatase calcineurin can dephosphorylate Bad, reversing the phosphorylation at both serine 112 and serine 136 (39Wang H.-G. Pathan N. Ethell I. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y.

When Bad is bound to prosurvival Bcl-2 family members, Bad serine 155 phosphorylation requires the prior phosphorylation at serine 136, which recruits 14-3-3 proteins that then function to increase the accessibility of serine 155 to survival-promoting kinases (43Datta S.R.

Bad is not a ubiquitously expressed protein. Nevertheless, several major signaling pathways influence cell survival through their effects on the phosphorylation state of Bad (44Downward J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E33-E35Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that man-LAM from the virulent Erdman strain of M. tuberculosis promotes phosphorylation of Bad at serine 136 through a PI-3K/Akt pathway in the human cell line THP-1 and hypothesize that this probably represents one of the mechanisms by which man-LAM promotes cell survival to the benefit of the pathogen. Histone 2B was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was purchased from Sigma. Protein A/G Plus-agarose, rabbit anti-p85 phosphoinositide 3-kinase, goat anti-Akt, and rabbit anti-Bad antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phophotyrosine antibody was from Life Technologies, Inc. Wortmannin, LY294002, PD98059, and SB203580 were from Calbiochem. Phosphorylation state-specific antibodies Bad (Ser112) and (Ser136) and Akt (Thr308) antibodies and the Phototope-HRP Chemiluminescent Western Detection Kit were from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). All other chemicals were from Sigma. THP-1 cells (derived from a patient with acute monocytic leukemia) are mature cells from the monocyte/macrophage lineage. These were obtained from the National Center for Cell Science (Pune, India). Media and supplements were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mmglutamine, and 20 mm sodium bicarbonate. The cells were incubated at 5% CO2 and 95% humidity in a 37 °C chamber. THP-1 cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to induce maturation of the monocytes to a macrophage-like, adherent phenotype. The cells were washed three times with culture medium without fetal bovine serum and resuspended to a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml. Cell viability was determined to be >95% by the trypan blue dye exclusion method. 2 × 106cells were plated in each well of six-well plates. Cells were deprived of serum by culturing in RPMI without fetal bovine serum for 12–16 h, before treatment with LAM. Transfections were carried out on adherent THP-1 cells (2 × 106 cells/well in six-well plates). Cells were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid (recombinants or empty vectors) using the Effectene Reagent (Qiagen) in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum according to the manufacturer's instructions. The dominant-negative mutant of p85 was deleted in the inter-SH2 region of wild type p85α (Δp85), which abolishes binding to the p110 subunit of PI 3-kinase. The kinase-deficient mutant of Akt (Akt.KD) carried the mutation K179M. Endotoxin-free man-LAM and ara-LAM were kindly provided by Dr. John Belisle (Colorado State University, Ft. Collins, CO, through NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Contract NO1-AI-75320). Man-LAM was derived from the virulent Erdman strain of M. tuberculosis. LAM was dissolved at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in pyrogen-free water and diluted with medium before each experiment. To assay for Akt protein kinase activity, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (45Datta K. Franke T.F. Chan T.O. Makris A. Yang S.-I. Kaplan D.R. Morrison D.K. Golemis E.A. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar); lysates were incubated with anti-Akt antibody, and kinase assays were carried out with the immunoprecipitates using histone 2B as substrate (45Datta K. Franke T.F. Chan T.O. Makris A. Yang S.-I. Kaplan D.R. Morrison D.K. Golemis E.A. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by adding protein gel denaturing buffer, and the mixture was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography. Following immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-p85 PI-3K antibody, immunoprecipitates were washed, and PI-3K assays were performed (46Whitman M. Kaplan D. Roberts T. Cantley L. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out for 15 min at room temperature, phosphorylated lipid products were extracted and separated on TLC plates (47Fukui Y. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and incorporated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Cells after treatment without or with LAM were washed, resuspended in buffer A (137 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm pefabloc), sonicated twice for 10 s each, and centrifuged for 5 min at 800 × g. After discarding the nuclei and unbroken cells, membranes were prepared by ultracentrifugation at 250,000 × g for 60 min. The pellets (membranes) were washed and suspended in buffer A. Cell lysates were prepared as described above and immunoprecipitated using anti-Akt, anti-Bad, or the respective phosphospecific antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide (10% for Akt and 12% for Bad) gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature, and finally visualized using the Phototope-HRP Western detection kit. Following treatment of THP-1 cells with man-LAM, the phosphorylation status of Bad was examined using phosphospecific antibodies. Man-LAM from the virulent Erdman species of M. tuberculosis promoted the phosphorylation of Bad at Ser136 in a time-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). LAM from a fast growing species (ara-LAM) did not exhibit an effect equivalent to that of man-LAM (data not shown). Phosphorylation of Bad at serine 112 was not observed. The phosphorylation of Bad at serine 136 occurs through a PI-3K/Akt-dependent pathway (26Datta, S. R., Dudek, H., Tao, X., Masters, S., Fu, H., Goto, Y., and Nunez, G. (1997) 91, 231–241Google Scholar, 27del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar, 28Eves E.M. Xiong W.

Biol. 1998; 8: 779-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated with selective inhibitors prior to stimulation with man-LAM in order to test their ability to block Bad phosphorylation. The PI-3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 inhibited Bad phosphorylation at serine 136 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1 B). The MEKK1 inhibitors PD90859 and SB20358 did not influence Bad phosphorylation (data not shown). It was inferred that man-LAM signals through PI-3K to phosphorylate Bad. Since man-LAM-induced Bad phosphorylation was abrogated by PI-3K inhibitors, in vitro PI-3K activity was tested after treatment with man-LAM. Man-LAM was found to stimulate PI-3K activity (Fig. 2 A) in a time-dependent manner. Control experiments showed that equal amounts of precipitated PI-3K were used to assay kinase activity. Activation of heterodimeric (p85-p110) PI-3K is often promoted by recruitment to the plasma membrane through interaction of SH2 domains in p85 with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Treatment with man-LAM caused a time-dependent increase in the amount of the p85 subunit detected in the membrane fraction, indicating translocation from the cytosol (Fig. 2 B). Tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 might represent another mechanism of PI-3K activation (48Kaplan D.R. Whitman M. Schaffhausen B. Pallas D.C. White M. Cantley L. Roberts T.M. Cell. 1987; 50: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. man-LAM treatment increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85α subunit of PI-3K in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2 C). The PI-3K-sensitive pathway of Bad phosphorylation involves the activation of the protein kinase Akt (or protein kinase B) and the phosphorylation of Bad at serine 136. The interaction of the amino-terminal pleckstrin homology domain of Akt with the phospholipid product of PI-3K induces a conformational change in Akt, making it a more efficient substrate for the phosphatidylinositide-dependent kinase 1 (49Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N. Norman D.G. Gaffney P. Reese C.B. MacDougall C.N. Harbison D. Ashworth A. Bownes M. Curr.

Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Stimulus-induced Akt phosphorylation on Thr308 by phosphatidylinositide-dependent kinase 1 and on Ser473 is required for maximal activity. To determine whether Akt is a downstream effector of man-LAM-induced PI-3K signaling in THP-1 cells, Akt phosphorylation on Thr308 was measured using immunoblotting with phosphospecific Thr308 anti-Akt antibody, followed by densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms. Man-LAM-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 in a dose-dependent (Fig.3 A) and time-dependent (Fig. 3 B) manner. LAM stimulated histone 2B phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner (Fig.3 C), indicating LAM-induced stimulation of Akt kinase activity. Histone phosphorylation stimulated by man-LAM was inhibited by the PI-3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 (Fig. 3 D). Unlike man-LAM, exposure of cells to ara-LAM for 60 min did not result in stimulation of Akt kinase activity (Fig. 3 D,lanes g–i). To establish whether Akt is the serine/threonine kinase that is downstream of PI-3K in the man-LAM signaling pathway, the effect of expression of the dominant negative mutant of p85α on LAM-induced Akt kinase activation was assessed. Thr308 phosphorylation of Akt was abrogated by expression of the Δp85 mutant of PI-3K but not by the control empty vector (Fig.3 E). In harmony with this, Bad phosphorylation at serine 136 was also abrogated in cells expressing Δp85 (data not shown). In order to establish a connection between Akt kinase activation and the phosphorylation of Bad at serine 136 induced by LAM, we transfected THP-1 cells with a kinase-dead mutant (K179M) of Akt and assessed the phosphorylation status of Bad. Akt.KD abrogated the phosphorylation of Bad following stimulation by LAM, whereas control empty vector had no such effect (Fig.3 F). The molecular basis of the pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis is poorly understood . M. tuberculosis is a facultative intracellular pathogen. Whereas the normal function of macrophages is to engulf and destroy microorganisms, mycobacteria have evolved ways to circumvent the defense mechanisms of macrophages. Central to the ability of M. tuberculosis to infect the host and cause active or latent disease is the propensity of the tubercle bacillus to enter the host mononuclear phagocyte and survive and multiply within macrophages. Macrophage apoptosis contributes to host defense against M. tuberculosis infection. Human alveolar macrophages undergo apoptosis in response to M. tuberculosisinfection (52Keane J.

Very recently it has been demonstrated that bacillary control of host cell apoptosis is a virulence-associated phenotype of M. tuberculosis, with virulent strains having the ability to evade apoptosis of infected macrophages (53Keane J. Remold H.G. Kornfeld H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2016-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In light of these observations, understanding the virulence factors that may modulate host cell apoptosis is necessary. We chose to study whether man-LAM from a virulent strain of M. tuberculosis could modulate cell signaling pathways known to control cell survival. The phosphorylation of Bad is one of the mechanisms of protection of cells from programmed cell death. We have tested the hypothesis that man-LAM from the virulent species of M. tuberculosisprotects cells from apoptosis at least partly through phosphorylation of Bad. Man-LAM was found to stimulate Bad phosphorylation on serine 136 in THP-1 cells. Bad phosphorylation at serine 136 is believed to occur via a PI-3K/Akt signaling pathway. Consistent with this, the PI-3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 inhibited the LAM-stimulated phosphorylation of Bad. Activation of PI-3K was observed after stimulation of cells with LAM. Furthermore, LAM caused p85 to translocate to the membrane, a phenomenon associated with enhanced lipid kinase activity of this enzyme. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 may represent another mechanism of PI-3K activation. LAM stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p85. The fact that PI-3K activation is sufficient for Bad phosphorylation upon treatment of cells with LAM was demonstrated by the fact that transfection of THP-1 cells with the dominant negative mutant (Δp85) of PI-3K abrogated LAM-mediated Bad phosphorylation. One of the major functions of Akt is protection of cells from programmed cell death. This protection has been demonstrated for several cell types including COS cells (23Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar), fibroblasts (24Kaufmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar), and neuronal cells (55Philpott K.L. McCarthy M.J. Klippel A. Rubin L.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This is at least in part due to the ability of Akt to phosphorylate Bad at serine 136. We attempted to establish a connection between PI-3K, Akt, and the phosphorylation of Bad. Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 was stimulated by LAM in a PI-3K-sensitive manner. Akt kinase activity assessed by using histone 2B as exogenous substrate was also stimulated by LAM. Transfection of THP-1 with the Δp85α mutant of PI-3K abolished the LAM-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 as well as the ability of Akt to phosphorylate histone 2B, establishing that Akt is a downstream effector of LAM-mediated PI-3K signaling. The connection between Akt and Bad was similarly established by transfecting cells with a kinase-deficient mutant of Akt (Akt.KD) and assessing the phosphorylation of Bad after stimulation with LAM. LAM-mediated Bad phosphorylation was abolished in cells transfected with Akt.KD. In summary, we demonstrate that man-LAM from the virulent Erdman strain of M. tuberculosis activates Akt in a PI-3K-sensitive manner, leading to the phosphorylation of Bad at serine 136, suggesting that this may be one of the mechanisms by which LAM directly promotes macrophage cell survival. Inhibition of macrophage apoptosis would allow the mycobacteria to escape from being packaged into apoptotic bodies. Uptake of bacilli packaged in this way is suggested to result in more effective microbicidal processing (54Fratazzi C. Arbeit C. Carini C. Remold H.G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4320-4327PubMed Google Scholar). This is the first demonstration of a mycobacterial virulence factor having the capability of up-regulating a macrophage survival signaling pathway, thereby creating an environment favorable for the survival of the pathogen. We are grateful to Drs. Robert Farase and Kenneth Walsh for the gifts of the Δp85 mutant of PI-3K and Akt.KD, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2060008863,"BarA is a membrane-associated protein that belongs to a subclass of tripartite sensors of the two-component signal transduction system family. In this study, we report that UvrY is the cognate response regulator for BarA of <i>Escherichia coli</i>. This conclusion is based upon homologies with analogous two-component systems and demonstrated by both biochemical and genetic means. We show that the purified BarA protein is able to autophosphorylate when incubated with [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP but not with [α-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP or [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]GTP. Phosphorylated BarA, in turn, acts as an efficient phosphoryl group donor to UvrY but not to the non-cognate response regulators ArcA, PhoB, or CpxR. The specificity of the transphosphorylation reaction is further supported by the fact that UvrY can receive the phosphoryl group from BarA-P but not from the non-cognate tripartite sensor ArcB-P or ATP. In addition, genetic evidence that BarA and UvrY mediate the same signal transduction pathway is provided by the finding that both <i>uvrY</i> and <i>barA</i> mutant strains exhibit the same hydrogen peroxide hypersensitive phenotype. These results provide the first biochemical evidence as well as genetic support for a link between BarA and UvrY, suggesting that the two proteins constitute a new two-component system for gene regulation in <i>Escherichia coli</i>."

We now report the identification and characterization of a new member of the FABP family that binds retinol and is highly expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. We screened sequences deposited with GenBankTM (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD) and identified an expressed sequence tag clone with a predicted amino acid sequence that has a high degree of homology to both mouse CRBP-I and CRBP-II. We obtained this clone (AA466092) through Research Genetics, Inc (Huntsville, AL). After subcloning the cDNA into pcDNA 3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), it was sequenced in both directions through the Columbia University Comprehensive Cancer Center Core DNA Sequencing Facility. Additional sequencing was performed after the cDNA was subcloned into the baculovirus expression vector pBlueBac4.5 (Invitrogen) and into the prokaryotic expression vector pET11A (Novagen, Madison WI) to verify that the cDNA was incorporated into these vectors in the proper orientation and with the reading frame intact. All-trans-retinol was obtained as a gift from Dr. Christian Eckhoff (Hoffman La Roche Inc., Nutley, NJ). 9-cis-Retinol was synthesized through reduction of 9-cis-retinaldehyde (Sigma) with sodium borohydride (19Mertz J.R.

The purity of the 9-cis-retinol was determined by normal phase HPLC employing procedures that are described in detail below (19Mertz J.R. Shang E. Piantedosi R. Wei S. Wolgemuth D.J. Blaner W.S. J.

Isomers of retinoic acid and retinal (9-cis-, 13-cis-, and all-trans), 13-cis-retinol, and sphingosine were purchased from Sigma. Lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, docosahexanoic acid, palmityl alcohol, petrosenlinyl alcohol, and ricinolenyl alcohol were purchased from NuChek (NuChek Prep Inc., Elysian, MN). Phytanic acid, oleic acid, arachidonic acid, linolenic acid, and lignoceric ceramide were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). The protein encoded by the cDNA described above was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells using a baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The mouse cDNA was subcloned into the pBlueBac4.5 vector and transfected together with disabled virus into actively dividing Sf9 cells. Recombinant virus containing the cDNA insert was plaque purified. The presence of the cDNA in the recombinant virus was verified by PCR. The initial low titer viral stock was used to generate a high titer viral stock. For expression of the protein, Sf9 cells were plated at a density of 107cells/150-cm2 flask and infected with recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Cells were harvested 72 h after infection, and the washed cell pellet was homogenized in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 1 mmEDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) sodium azide, 7.5 μm aprotinin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride using a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 8000 ×g for 20 min to remove cell debris and the nuclear fraction. Cytosolic and the crude microsomal fractions were obtained upon centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C using a Beckman TC-100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The presence of recombinant 15-kDa protein in the crude microsomal and cytosolic fractions was assessed on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel to verify protein expression. As an alternative to expressing the cDNA in Sf9 cells, we employed a prokaryotic expression vector to generate recombinant protein in E. coli. For this purpose, the cDNA was cloned into a pET11A expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). To clone the cDNA into the pET11A vector, a NdeI restriction site upstream of the translation start site and a BamHI restriction site downstream of the translation termination site were created through PCR amplification of the cDNA employing primers containing the specified restriction sites. The sequence of the 5′ primer we employed was 5′-GGGAATTCCATATGCCAGCAGACCTCAGCGGTAC-3′ and that of the 3′ primer was 5′-CGCGGATCCTCAGGCTCTCTGGAAGGTTTG-3′. Each PCR amplification reaction contained forward and reverse primers (0.2 μm for each), 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer in 50 μl. The following PCR conditions were employed: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 45 s, annealing at 55 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min in a DNA Thermal Cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The PCR product was subcloned into pCR II according to the instructions of the supplier (Invitrogen). Subsequently, the cDNA insert was excised from pCR II and directionally subcloned into the NdeI and BamHI restrictions sites of the pET11A vector. Recombinant protein was expressed in BL23(DE3) E. coli (Novagen). E. colicontaining the pET11A expression vector were grown at 30 °C to an A660 of 0.6 and expression was induced with 100 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. After harvesting of the induced bacterial cells by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the cell pellet was resuspended in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) sodium azide, 7.5 μm aprotinin, and 0.5 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and sonicated with three bursts of 30 s duration at half-maximal intensity. During sonication, the resuspended bacterial pellet was kept on ice. Following sonication, the soluble fraction was obtained upon ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C using a Beckman TC-100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Recombinant CRBP-III protein expressed either in Sf9 cells or in E. coli was purified from the cytosol fraction obtained from Sf9 cell or E. coli homogenates (as described above) using two size exclusion columns. The cytosol fraction was initially applied to a Bio-Gel P-100 polyacrylamide gel exclusion column (100 × 2.5 cm) (Bio-Rad), equilibrated in homogenization buffer. Following absorbance at 280 nm monitored elution of proteins from this column. The recombinant protein eluted from the Bio-Gel P-100 column in approximately 60–69 ml of buffer, an elution volume that should contain proteins with masses ranging from 10 to 20 kDa. The fractions thought to contain the 15-kDa protein were confirmed by analysis on 15% SDS-PAGE gels. These fractions were combined and concentrated to 2 ml using Centriplus concentrators with a molecular weight cut off of 3000 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The concentrate of fractions containing the 15-kDa protein was then applied to a Bio-Gel P-30 sizing column (120 cm × 2.5 cm) (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with homogenization buffer. Again, protein was followed by absorbance monitored at 280 nm. The presence of a 15-kDa protein in fractions eluting from the Bio-Gel P-30 column was identified by analysis on 15% SDS-PAGE gels. These fractions were combined and concentrated prior to use for the binding assays described below. To confirm that we had indeed purified a protein predicted by the CRBP-III cDNA, the N-terminal sequence of the purified recombinant protein was analyzed. For this purpose the protein was electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Millipore). The membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the protein band running at approximately 15 kDa was excised from the membrane and subjected to automated N-terminal sequencing (21Ferrara P. Rosenfeld J. Guillemot J.C. Capdeville J. Angeletti R.H. Techniques in Protein Chemistry IV. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 379-387Crossref Google Scholar). N-terminal sequence analysis was performed at the Columbia University Howard Hughes Protein Chemistry Core Facility. Female and male adult C57Bl/6J mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxia, tissues removed, immediately placed in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C until RNA extraction. Total RNA from liver, kidney, heart, lung, spleen, skeletal muscle (gastronemius), small intestine, ovaries, fallopian tubes, testes, seminal vesicles, and the ovarian and epididymal fat depots was extracted using RNAzol (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX). Total RNA (25 μg/lane) was resolved by gel electrophoresis in 1% agarose containing 0.98 mformaldehyde (22Rajan N. Blaner W.S. Soprano D.R. Suhara A. Goodman D.S. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 821-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For all RNA samples, the ratio of intensities of the 28 and 18 S ribosomal RNA bands after staining with ethidium bromide was approximately 2. Immediately following electrophoresis, the RNA was transferred by capillary action to a positively charged Nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subsequently hybridized at 65 °C with 32P-labeled probes for the mouse cDNA and with control probes for rat CRBP-I (22Rajan N. Blaner W.S. Soprano D.R. Suhara A. Goodman D.S. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 821-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The probes were labeled with 32P using a random priming kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hybridized membranes were washed at a final stringency of 0.1× SSC, 1.0% SDS at 65 °C and exposed to Kodak AR-2 film at −80 °C. An RNA ladder from Ambion (Austin, TX) was used to estimate transcript sizes. In situ hybridization studies of expression of the cDNA in the embryonic mouse was performed using digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes essentially as described in Mendelsohn et al. (23Mendelsohn C. Batourina K. Fung S. Gilbert T. Dodd J. Development. 1999; 126: 1139-1148PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the procedures we employed to stage the mouse embryos, for their fixation and the sectioning of embryos are also described in Mendelsohn et al. (23Mendelsohn C. Batourina K. Fung S. Gilbert T. Dodd J. Development. 1999; 126: 1139-1148PubMed Google Scholar). For antisense probes, the cDNA in pcDNA3 was linearized with EcoRI, and antisense transcripts were generated with T7 polymerase. For preparation of sense probes, the same cDNA was linearized with HindIII, and"

In all cases, prereduced (ferrous) enzyme was rapidly mixed with an O2-containing buffer to start the reaction. A ferrous-dioxy intermediate formed quickly (53 s−1) and then decayed with concurrent buildup of ferric iNOSoxy. The buildup of the ferrous-dioxy intermediate preceded both H4B radical formation and Arg hydroxylation. However, the rate of ferrous-dioxy decay (12 s−1) was equivalent to the rate of H4B radical formation (11 s−1) and the rate of Arg hydroxylation (9 s−1). Practically all bound H4B was oxidized to a radical during the reaction and was associated with hydroxylation of 0.6 mol of Arg/mol of heme. In dihydrobiopterin-containing iNOSoxy, ferrous-dioxy decay was much slower and was not associated with Arg hydroxylation. These results establish kinetic and quantitative links among ferrous-dioxy disappearance, H4B oxidation, and Arg hydroxylation and suggest a mechanism whereby H4B transfers an electron to the ferrous-dioxy intermediate to enable the formation of a heme-based oxidant that rapidly hydroxylates Arg.

The reaction consumes 1.5 NADPH and 2 O2 for each NO formed from Arg and is catalyzed in two steps (for review see Refs. 1Stuehr D.J. Ghosh S. Mayer B. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology.

NOHA then undergoes mixed function oxidation in the second step to generate water, NO, and citrulline. Both reactions take place within the oxygenase domain of NOS, which contains iron protoporphyrin IX (heme), the cofactor (6 R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin (H4B), and the Arg binding site (1Stuehr D.J.

Accordingly, the mechanisms for Arg hydroxylation in NOS have been modeled after cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase chemistry (Scheme FS1). The transfer of an electron to the ferric NOS heme enables O2 binding and formation of detectable ferrous-dioxy species (I,FeIIO2) (8Boggs S. Huang L. Stuehr D.J.

This species obtains a second electron to form the iron-peroxo species (II), which upon protonation and O–O bond scission generate water and iron-oxo species (III, FeO) that is thought to hydroxylate the guanidino nitrogen of Arg.In contrast to close proximity between substrate and heme, the H4B cofactor binds away from Arg but next to the heme edge and forms a hydrogen bond between N3 of its pterin ring and a heme propionate (5Crane B.R.

Its position suggests that H4B cannot directly participate in O2 binding or substrate oxidation but could function as an electron donor (6Raman C.S. Li H. Martasek P. Kral V. Masters B.B.S.

In NOS, the first electron provided to the heme comes directly from the reductase domain, and this transfer does not require that H4B be present (13Presta A. Siddhanta U. Wu C. Sennequier N. Huang L.

However, either the reductase domain or H4B could conceivably provide the second electron to the FeIIO2 species (I). Indeed, a recent study with the inducible NOS oxygenase domain (iNOSoxy) showed that bound H4B is oxidized to a radical when ferrous iNOSoxy reacts with O2 (15Hurshman A.R. Krebs C. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15689-15696Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar).

Kominami S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16629-16635Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, what kinetic and quantitative relationships that may exist between H4B oxidation, FeIIO2 formation and disappearance, and product formation remain to be explored.To address this issue, we combined stopped-flow, rapid-quench, and rapid-freeze methods to analyze Arg hydroxylation during a single catalytic turnover by ferrous iNOSoxy. Our results reveal and define the temporal and quantitative links that exist between FeIIO2 reactivity, H4B radical formation, and Arg hydroxylation and thus clarify how H4B and heme cooperate in the first step of NO synthesis.RESULTSWe monitored a single catalytic turnover in iNOSoxy. A dithionite-reduced (ferrous) iNOSoxy containing Arg and H4B was rapidly mixed with an O2-containing buffer to initiate the reaction, which was then analyzed by one of three methods: rapid scanning to follow heme transitions, rapid quenching to follow product formation, or rapid freezing to follow buildup of the H4B radical. Fig. 1, A–F, contains representative data from each type of experiment.Figure 1Kinetics of heme transformations, product formation, and radical buildup during Arg hydroxylation in a single catalytic turnover. In all cases anaerobic ferrous iNOSoxy containing Arg and H4B was rapidly mixed with an O2-containing solution at 10 °C to start the reaction (see “Experimental Procedures” and “Results” for details).A, shows the light absorbance spectra for the three species discerned during the reaction: beginning ferrous iNOSoxy (a), a transient heme-oxy intermediate (b), and the final ferric enzyme (c).

The transient species had a Soret peak at 427 nm and visible spectral features that identify it as FeIIO2 iNOSoxy (8Boggs S. Huang L. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2332-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9Couture M. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol.

Thus, the formation and decay of this intermediate probably represent the buildup of the FeIIO2 complex and its subsequent reaction during the single turnover experiment.Analysis of the kinetic spectral data showed that it only was fit well to an “A to B to C” kinetic model with monophasic transitions for formation and decay of the FeIIO2 intermediate. This means that no spectrally distinct species were built up during the conversion of the FeIIO2 intermediate to the ferric enzyme. Fig.1 B illustrates how concentrations of the three spectral species changed with time during the single turnover reaction. The FeIIO2 intermediate formed rapidly and reached a maximum after 32 ms. Its conversion to the ferric enzyme was essentially completed by 300 ms after mixing. The calculated rates of formation and/or decay of each of the species are listed in TableI. To understand how H4B influenced this transformation, we used a H2B-saturated iNOSoxy in an otherwise identical stopped-flow experiment. We observed the same three spectral species (data not shown), but in this case conversion of the FeIIO2 intermediate to the ferric enzyme occurred at a rate of 0.3 s−1, which is 40 times slower compared with the H4B-containing enzyme.Table IObserved rate constants for transformations in the single turnover reactionTransformationsObserved rate constants1-aValues are the means ± S.D. with number of experiments in parentheses.s −1FeIIO2formation1-bAt an estimated O2concentration of 110 μm.52.7 ± 2.2 (4)FeIIO2 disappearance12.5 ± 0.2 (4)NOHA formation (or Arg disappearance)9.2 ± 1.1 (3)H4B radical formation11.1 (2)H4B radical decay 0.71 (2)Anaerobic ferrous iNOSoxy that contained Arg (or [14C]Arg) and H4B was rapid-mixed with O2-containing buffer at 10 °C to start the reaction.

Open table in a new tab Rapid-quench experiments revealed that H4B-containing iNOSoxy oxidized [14C]Arg to NOHA but not to citrulline during the single turnover reaction (Fig. 1 C). This conversion was substoichiometric with respect to heme (0.55 ± 0.06 NOHA-generated/heme, n = 4) even when Arg and H4B achieved saturation binding (see “Experimental Procedures”). No NOHA was generated in reactions where H2B was substituted for H4B or when iNOSoxy was not reduced or was absent (data not shown). The time course of [14C]Arg oxidation and NOHA buildup are illustrated in Fig. 1 D. The estimated rates of [14C]Arg disappearance and NOHA formation were essentially identical and are listed in Table I. The conversion to NOHA was completed within 0.4 s after starting the reaction. The fact that some [14C]Arg remained after the reaction was completed is consistent with our use of less [14C]Arg than iNOSoxy in this experiment (see “Experimental Procedures”) and the known binding affinity of Arg (Ks = 2–5 μm).Rapid-freeze experiments showed that a free radical signal (g = 2.0) had built up in iNOSoxy during the single turnover reaction (Fig. 1 E). Its spectral characteristics closely matched those of the H4B radical reported by Hurshman et al. (15Hurshman A.R. Krebs C. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15689-15696Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). For example, the radical signal had a peak to trough line width of 40 G and evidence of a hyperfine structure. The free radical signal did not build up in an identical experiment that used H2B-saturated iNOSoxy (data not shown). These results confirm that bound H4B is oxidized by one electron during the single turnover reaction. The kinetics of H4B radical formation and decay are shown in Fig.1 F. Maximum intensity was achieved at about 125 ms where the radical concentration reached approximately 75% total iNOSoxy heme concentration. Its estimated formation rate was 11 s−1 and decay rate was 0.7 s−1 (Table I). These kinetics of H4B radical buildup and decay in our system match those observed by Hurshman et al. (15Hurshman A.R. Krebs C. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15689-15696Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONWe followed FeIIO2 formation and disappearance, H4B radical formation, and Arg hydroxylation during a single catalytic turnover by iNOSoxy to understand their relationships and discern the mechanism of Arg hydroxylation. The kinetic results showed: 1) The FeIIO2intermediate forms quickly and disappears faster in an H4B-containing enzyme than in the H2B-containing enzyme. 2) The rate of FeIIO2 disappearance is equivalent to the rate of H4B radical formation. 3) Both of these processes are linked to Arg hydroxylation, which occurs at essentially the same rate.The buildup of the oxygenated intermediate (Soret at 427 nm) clearly preceded both H4B radical formation and Arg hydroxylation. Indeed, at the point of its maximum buildup (32 ms) only 10–15% bound H4B had formed a radical. This means that the oxygenated intermediate cannot already contain an electron from H4B and is in fact FeIIO2 iNOSoxy. The disappearance of the FeIIO2 intermediate followed the same kinetics as the H4B radical buildup and was much slower in H2B iNOSoxy. Together, these results indicate that FeIIO2 formation is a prerequisite for H4B oxidation, and H4B oxidation represents electron transfer from H4B to the FeIIO2 intermediate.Because H4B oxidation also occurred at the same rate as Arg hydroxylation and without buildup of additional heme-oxy intermediates, all steps required to form the ultimate oxidant and hydroxylate Arg must be as fast as (or faster than) the electron transfer from H4B. Thus, FeIIO2 reduction is rate-limiting when one starts the reaction with ferrous enzyme. A similar situation holds true in many cytochrome P-450 enzymes where steps beyond FeIIO2 reduction occur faster than the electron transfer to the heme (18Benson D.E. Suslick K.S. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5104-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19Ortiz de Montellano, P. R. (ed) (1986) Cytochrome P-450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry, pp. 217-271, Plenum Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar).Our results also show how coupled these processes are within the single turnover. For example, practically all bound H4B appeared to transfer an electron to the FeIIO2intermediate. This finding is evidenced by the high degree of radical buildup (0.75 per heme) despite its concurrent decay and by the FeIIO2 species disappearing completely according to a monophasic rate. If some unreacted H4B had remained in the enzyme or if the transfer between H4B and FeIIO2 was uncoupled, we should have observed less radical buildup and/or biphasic decay of the FeIIO2 intermediate. A complete well coupled electron transfer between H4B and FeIIO2 is consistent with their close proximity and the irreversible nature of the single turnover reaction.Given the above results, one would expect that Arg hydroxylation should match H4B radical formation and generate 1 NOHA/heme. However, we and others (8Boggs S. Huang L. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2332-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Bec N. Gorren A.C. Voelker C. Mayer B. Lange R. J. Biol.

Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15689-15696Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) typically observe substoichiometric NOHA formation in single turnover reactions ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 NOHA formed per heme. Here the estimated stoichiometry was about 0.6 NOHA formed per heme. Our current work shows that events leading up to and including the reduction of the FeIIO2intermediate by H4B were tightly coupled and complete. This rules out incomplete electron transfer from H4B as a possible explanation and instead implies that subsequent steps (i.e. conversion of the iron-peroxo intermediate to iron-oxo or its reaction with Arg) become uncoupled in the iNOSoxy reaction. Further studies should resolve this issue.The ability of H4B to speed the “decay” of the FeIIO2 species was first observed while conducting O2 binding studies with the neuronal NOS oxygenase domain (20Abu-Soud H.M. Gachhui R. Raushel F.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and full-length nNOS (10Sato H. Sagami I. Daff S. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Of the multiple effects that H4B has on NOS, this one cannot be mimicked by H2B and is therefore linked to the tetrahydro reduction state (13Presta A. Siddhanta U. Wu C. Sennequier N. Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Erzurum S. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that H4B does not speed superoxide release from the FeIIO2 complex as originally proposed (20Abu-Soud H.M. Gachhui R. Raushel F.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Rather, it reduces the FeIIO2 complex, thus providing a faster route for its disappearance. In the single turnover reaction, FeIIO2 “disappearance” represents its reduction and conversion to a heme-oxy species that can hydroxylate Arg very quickly. H4B also appears capable of reducing the FeIIO2 intermediate in the absence of Arg (15Hurshman A.R. Krebs C. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15689-15696Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar,20Abu-Soud H.M. Gachhui R. Raushel F.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In this circumstance, H2O2 could be released from the heme as it occurs in the cytochromes P-450 (18Benson D.E. Suslick K.S. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5104-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19Ortiz de Montellano, P. R. (ed) (1986) Cytochrome P-450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry, pp. 217-271, Plenum Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar) and should be fast compared with superoxide release. This may explain how H4B decreases superoxide production in Arg-free NOS despite greatly increasing its rate of NADPH oxidation (21Pou S. Keaton L. Surichamorn W. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9573-9580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 22Vasquez-Vivar J. Hogg N. Martasek P. Karoui H. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26736-26742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).Because the NOS reductase domain can transfer NADPH electrons directly to the heme, it is puzzling why H4B should also be an electron donor. In fact, H4B is not essential for Arg hydroxylation, which can be catalyzed by H4B-free NOS in an NADPH-driven reaction, albeit being in an uncoupled manner relative to NADPH consumption (14Adak S. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33554-33561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of H4B in the first step of NO synthesis is to couple Arg hydroxylation to NADPH consumption. H4B could accomplish this task by providing an electron to the FeIIO2 intermediate more quickly than the reductase domain. Consider that the FeIIO2 intermediate is unreactive toward Arg but will decay to superoxide and ferric enzyme if a second electron is not provided in a timely manner. In the absence of H4B, the decay of the FeIIO2 complex at 10 °C varies from 0.1 s−1 in the nNOS oxygenase domain (20Abu-Soud H.M. Gachhui R. Raushel F.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) to 11 s−1 in full-length nNOS. 2S. Adak and D. J. Stuehr, unpublished results. NOS reductase domains transfer an electron to the ferric heme at rates ranging from 0.1 to 3 s−1 at 10 °C (23Abu-Soud H.M. Ichimori K. Presta A. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17349-17357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and this rate does not increase in the absence of H4B (13Presta A. Siddhanta U. Wu C. Sennequier N. Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Erzurum S. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Because heme reduction by the reductase domain is slower than either H4B radical buildup or FeIIO2 decay in full-length nNOS, we propose that H4B is a kinetically preferred source of the second electron. Thus, H4B circumvents a kinetic problem in heme reduction during oxygen activation and enables NOS to tightly couple NADPH oxidation to Arg hydroxylation. 3H4B probably performs the same function during O2 activation for NOHA oxidation. However, we believe that H4B performs an additional role by acting as an electron acceptor after its radical formation to assure NOS releases NO instead of nitroxyl (see Ref. 14Adak S. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33554-33561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar for details).Fig. 2 contains a mechanism for Arg hydroxylation that incorporates our kinetic results. The ferric heme first receives an electron from the reductase domain. This enables rapid O2 binding (at the O2 concentration used here) and buildup of the FeIIO2 intermediate. H4B then reduces the FeIIO2intermediate and becomes a relatively long-lived H4B radical. This enables NOS to form the ultimate oxidant, but all steps involved in its formation (presumably proton transfer and O–O bond scission to form iron-oxo (FeO); see Scheme FS1) as well as Arg hydroxylation occur quickly relative to the electron transfer from H4B. In the normal NADPH-driven reaction, the transfer of the first electron from the reductase domain is rate-limiting, whereas in the single turnover reaction the reduction of the FeIIO2 intermediate by H4B is rate-limiting. The relative stability of the H4B radical should enable it to be reduced back to H4B by the reductase domain before it is needed for oxygen activation in the second step of NO synthesis (14Adak S. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33554-33561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).Figure 2Kinetics of Arg hydroxylation. In the NADPH-driven reaction, the slow step is the transfer of an electron from the reductase flavins (FMNH2) to the ferric heme. Oxygen then binds to form the FeIIO2 species, which receives an electron from H4B to form a heme-peroxo intermediate. Subsequent steps that lead to and include Arg hydroxylation are rapid and generate ferric iNOSoxy containing NOHA and the H4B radical.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In conclusion, our work demonstrates the kinetic and quantitative relationships among H4B oxidation, FeIIO2 disappearance, and Arg hydroxylation in NOS. H4B appears to be a kinetically competent and complete source of the second electron to reduce the FeIIO2 intermediate. It will now be important to identify the structural features of the enzyme that control these processes. The electron transfer between H4B and the FeIIO2 intermediate should depend on their relative redox potentials and structural proximity. Crystallography has identified residues that surround H4B or stack with the NOS heme (5Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A.

The peripheral T cell pool of p56 lck (lck)–deficient mice was reconstituted by the expression of an inducible lck transgene. Continued survival of peripheral naı̈ve T cells was observed for long periods after switching off the transgene. Adoptive transfer of T cells from these mice into T lymphopoienic hosts confirmed that T cell survival was independent of lck but revealed its essential role in TCR-driven homeostatic proliferation of naı̈ve T cells in response to the T cell–deficient host environment. These data suggest that survival and homeostatic expansion depend on different signals."

Under the control of the zinc-inducible metallothionein promoter, the transgene was expressed in most tissues including the heart, kidney, lung, and brain, and human kallikrein was detected in the urine of transgenic animals. Transgenic rats had a lower 24-h mean arterial pressure in comparison with control rats, which was further decreased when their diet was supplemented with zinc. The day/night rhythm of blood pressure was significantly diminished in TGR(hKLK1) animals, whereas the circadian rhythms of heart rate and locomotor activity were unaffected. Induction of cardiac hypertrophy by isoproterenol treatment revealed a marked protective effect of the kallikrein transgene because the cardiac weight of TGR(hKLK1) increased significantly less, and the expression of atrial natriuretic peptide and collagen III as markers for hypertrophy and fibrosis, respectively, were less enhanced. The specific kinin-B2 receptor antagonist, icatibant, abolished this cardioprotective effect. In conclusion, the kallikrein-kinin system is an important determinant in the regulation of blood pressure and its circadian rhythmicity. It also exerts antihypertrophic and antifibrotic actions in the heart."
https://openalex.org/W1976839484,"We showed previously that maturation of the human frataxin precursor (p-fxn) involves two cleavages by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP). This observation was not confirmed by another group, however, who reported only one cleavage. Here, we demonstrate conclusively that MPP cleaves p-fxn in two sequential steps, yielding a 18,826-Da intermediate (i-fxn) and a 17,255-Da mature (m-fxn) form, the latter corresponding to endogenous frataxin in human tissues. The two cleavages occur between residues 41–42 and 55–56, and both match the MPP consensus sequence RX ↓ (X/S). Recombinant rat and yeast MPP catalyze the p → i step 4 and 40 times faster, respectively, than the i → m step. In isolated rat mitochondria, p-fxn undergoes a sequence of cleavages, p → i → m → d1 → d2, with d1and d2 representing two C-terminal fragments of m-fxn produced by an unknown protease. The i → m step is limiting, and the overall rate of p → i → m does not exceed the rate of m → d1 → d2, such that the levels of m-fxn do not change during incubations as long as 3 h.

Most nuclear-encoded mitochondrial precursors are processed to their mature form by MPP, and even though the length of the targeting signal may vary considerably among different proteins, only one cleavage is normally required (16Neupert W.

In this study, we present conclusive evidence that p-fxn is processed to the mature form in two sequential steps. We show that the precursor is cleaved rapidly and quantitatively to the intermediate form, whereas the i → m reaction is slower and limits the overall rate at which m-fxn is produced within mitochondria. This reaction is further inhibited by a known FRDA point mutation, suggesting that defects in i → m processing may contribute to the disease. The 5′-and 3′-untranslated regions of the FRDA cDNA were modified by PCR using primers 5′HUMYB-S (5′-cgcggatccgtagcaatgtggactctcgggcgc-3′), introducing aBamHI site and the ribosome-binding site of theYFH1 gene transcript immediately upstream of the initiator ATG, and 3′HUMB-AS (5′-cgcggatcctcaagcatcttttccggaata-3′), introducing a BamHI site downstream of the stop codon, or 3′HUMMet-AS (5′-cgcggatcctcacatcatagcatcttttccggaata-3′), introducing two ATG upstream and a BamHI site downstream of the stop codon. The two PCR products, FRDA and FRDAMet, were cloned in the BamHI site of a TRP1-based, 2-μm yeast expression vector, pG-3 (18Schena M. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), downstream of the yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter, yielding plasmids pG3-FRDA and pG3-FRDAMet. For in vitro expression, the FRDAMet PCR product was cloned into the BamHI site of vector pGEM-3Zf(+) (Promega), yielding plasmid pGEM-FRDAMet. To obtain molecular mass markers to map the i-fxn and m-fxn N termini, the 5′ region of the FRDA cDNA was deleted by use of two forward primers including a BamHI site, a Kozak sequence, an ATG codon, and codons 43–49 (5′-gcggatccgccaccatgcgcaccgacatcgatgcgacc-3′) or 57–63 (5′-cgcggatccgccaccatgtcgaaccaacgtggcctcaac-3′) of the FRDA cDNA, coupled with primer 3′HUMMet-AS, yielding constructs pGEM-FRDA(L42M) and pGEM-FRDA(S56M). For analysis of FRDA point mutations, forward primers encoding the desired point mutations were coupled with the 3′HUMMet-AS primer, and the resulting PCR products used as antisense primers were coupled with the 5′HUMYB-S primer. The final PCR products were digested with NotI andBspEI, and the 505-base pair fragment was subcloned into plasmid YC-FRDA, yielding YC-FRDA(G130V) and YC-FRDA(W173G) vectors (19Cavadini P. Gellera C. Patel P.I. Isaya G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2523-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A 647-base pair BamHI fragment was excised from these vectors and cloned into pGEM-3Zf(+), yielding constructs pGEM-G130V and pGEM-W173G (19Cavadini P. Gellera C. Patel P.I. Isaya G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2523-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For radiosequencing, the FRDA cDNA was modified using primers 5′KMetB-S (5′-cgcggatccgccaccatgtggactctcctcgggcgc-3′) including aBamHI site, a Kozak sequence, and the 5′-end of the FRDA coding sequence, and Leu62Met-AS (5′-attccaaatctggttcatgccacgttggttcga-3′), including codons 57–67 of FRDA, with a CTC → ATG change at codon 62. This PCR product was coupled with primer 3′HUMB-AS, and the final PCR product was cloned into pGEM-3Zf(+), yielding plasmid pGEM-FRDA(L62M). For radiosequencing of i-fxn-G130V and i-fxn-W173G, the G130V or W173G mutation was introduced in the pGEM-FRDA(L62M) construct to yield the pGEM-FRDA(L62M/G130V) or pGEM-FRDA(L62M/W173G) construct. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The yfh1Δ and complementedyfh1Δ[YFH1] strains were described previously (20Branda S.S. Yang Z.Y. Chew A. Isaya G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1099-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To produce a fxn-expressing strain,yfh1Δ[YFH1] was transformed with plasmid pG3-FRDA and pG3-FRDAMet, and the URA3-based YCp50-YFH1 plasmid was eliminated by counterselection with 5-fluoroorotic acid (21Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), yielding the yfh1Δ[pG3-FRDA] andyfh1Δ[pG3-FRDAMet] strains. Yeast cells were grown in 5 ml of YPD (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% dextrose) to late log phase at 30 °C, and total extracts were prepared as described (20Branda S.S. Yang Z.Y. Chew A. Isaya G.

Rinaldo, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, NY) were homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10′. The supernatant was incubated with 0.25% SDS, 2% Triton X-100, 1000 units/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, for 1 h at 4 °C, and clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30′. Protein concentration was determined by the BCATM protein assay kit (Pierce). Anti-Yfh1p antibodies were as previously described (19Cavadini P. Gellera C. Patel P.I. Isaya G. Hum. Mol.

All constructs used in this study were synthesized in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine using TNT Quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Previously described procedures were used for mitochondrial import and processing assays (12Branda S.S. Cavadini P. Adamec J. Kalousek F. Taroni F. Isaya G. J. Biol.

Processing and import reactions were analyzed by SDS/PAGE using T = 12.5% separating gels (where T denotes the total concentration of acrylamide and bisacrylamide), from a stock solution of acrylamide:bisacrylamide = 40:1.7. Electrophoresis was started at 160 V, shifted to 230 V after the samples had completely entered the separating gel, and continued for an additional 45 min after the samples had reached the bottom of the gel. For N-terminal radiosequencing, the pGEM-FRDA(L62M), pGEM-FRDA(L62M/G130V), and pGEM-FRDA(L62M/W173G) constructs were transcribed and translatedin vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine, and radiolabeled precursors were incubated with recombinant yeast MPP. Processing products were separated by SDS/PAGE, electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and detected by autoradiography. The desired band was excised and applied directly on a PE/ABD Procise 494-HS sequencer, and 100% of each fraction was collected and analyzed by scintillation counting (24Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We and others showed previously that p-fxn is processed by MPP to two smaller products with apparent molecular mass on SDS/PAGE of 21,000 (i-fxn) and 18,000 Da (m-fxn) (12Branda S.S. Cavadini P.

Genet. 1998; 7: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The 21-kDa product was shown to co-migrate with a polypeptide corresponding to residues 41–210 of p-fxn (13Koutnikova H. Campuzano V. Koenig M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and the 18-kDa product was shown to co-migrate with endogenous frataxin in human tissues (12Branda S.S. Cavadini P. Adamec J.

Genet. 1998; 7: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In a more recent study of p-fxn processing, however, Gordon et al. (14Gordon D.M. Shi Q. Dancis A. Pain D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2255-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) detected only the 21-kDa product and concluded that this represents the mature form of fxn. To clarify this apparent discrepancy, we re-examined the processing of p-fxn by recombinant yeast MPP. To enhance detection of 35S-labeled m-fxn by SDS/PAGE and fluorography, a two-methionine tag was fused in frame to the C terminus of p-fxn. Processing of this construct yielded two products, i-fxn and m-fxn, that co-migrated with standard polypeptides corresponding to residues 42–210 and 56–210, respectively, of p-fxn (Fig. 1 A). Whereas p-fxn was efficiently converted to i-fxn, processing of i-fxn to m-fxn was significantly less efficient (Fig. 1 A), and if we used a precursor lacking the two-methionine tag, we detected only trace amounts of m-fxn (not shown). This suggests that Gordon et al. (14Gordon D.M. Shi Q. Dancis A. Pain D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2255-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) may have not identified the 18-kDa product because their method for detection was not sufficiently sensitive. N-terminal radiosequencing of i-fxn and m-fxn revealed that the former is processed between residues 41 and 42 (RRG ↓ LRT) (Fig. 1 B), and the latter is processed between residues 55 and 56 (RRA ↓ SSN) (Fig. 1 C), with both cleavages matching the MPP consensus sequence RX ↓ (X/S) (25Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Lack of detectability may explain why Gordon et al. (14Gordon D.M. Shi Q. Dancis A. Pain D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2255-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) identified the peptide predicted to be released by the first cleavage (residues 1–41, ∼4 kDa) but not the much shorter peptide predicted to be released by the second cleavage (residues 42–55, ∼1.4 kDa). The calculated molecular masses of the intermediate and mature form of frataxin are 18,826 and 17,255 Da, slightly lower than predicted from their mobility on SDS/PAGE. Similarly, p-fxn has a calculated molecular mass of 23,135 Da, lower than its apparent molecular mass of 30,000 Da on SDS/PAGE (Fig. 1 A). Abnormal mobility on SDS/PAGE has also been reported for the Yfh1p precursor and its processing products (11Knight S.A. Sepuri N.B. Pain D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18389-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 12Branda S.S. Cavadini P. Adamec J. Kalousek F. Taroni F. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22763-22769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and is explained by the acidic nature of these proteins. To exclude the possibility that the two-methionine tag might somehow alter the processing of p-fxn, precursor polypeptides with or without the tag were expressed in yeast and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 2 A and not shown). We have recently shown that a full-length human frataxin precursor complements yeast cells lacking endogenous Yfh1p (19Cavadini P. Gellera C. Patel P.I. Isaya G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2523-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Accordingly, bothyfh1Δ[pG3-FRDA] and yfh1Δ[pG3-FRDAMet] cells exhibited a normal phenotype (not shown). Total extracts fromyfh1Δ[pG3-FRDA] cells contained two products of 21 and 18 kDa (lane 2) that were not detected inyfh1Δ[YFH1] (lane 1). Two slightly larger products were detected in yfh1Δ[pG3-FRDAMet] cells and found to co-migrate with the i-fxn and m-fxn products obtained by in vitro processing of p-fxn (not shown). These products associated with the mitochondrial fraction (lane 4) and were protected from externally added proteinase K (lane 3). The 18-kDa product detected in yfh1Δ[pG3-FRDA] cells co-migrated with a bacterially expressed protein translated from a methionine residue replacing serine 56 (i.e. the N terminus of m-fxn, as determined by radiosequencing in Fig. 1 C, lane 5). The 18-kDa product was also found to co-migrate with endogenous frataxin in three different human tissues (Fig. 2 B, lanes 7, 9, and11).Figure 1Determination of the i-fxn and m-fxn processing sites.

[35S]Methionine-labeled p-fxn(L62M) was incubated with yeast MPP, and the processing products were separated by SDS/PAGE, electroblotted, and detected by autoradiography. The i-fxn and m-fxn bands were excised and subjected to N-terminal sequencing, and 100% of each fraction was analyzed by scintillation counting. B, Leu42 marks the N terminus of i-fxn as determined by release of [35S]methionine in cycle 21. C, Ser56 marks the N terminus of m-fxn as determined by release of [35S]methionine in cycle 7. Because of inefficient processing of i-fxn to m-fxn, the m-fxn sample contained a small amount of protein and the level of isotope released in cycle 7 was only slightly above background.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Two-step processing of p-fxn and pYfh1p by recombinant yeast MPP.

The band marked by anasterisk was only detected in fibroblasts and may represent a nonspecific cross-reacting product.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Unlike m-fxn, the intermediate form was not consistently seen in human tissues. For example, i-fxn was not detected in heart (Fig. 2 B, lane 7) but was present in trace amounts in liver (lane 9) and in more discrete amounts in fibroblasts (lane 11). This suggests that a kinetic effect may be responsible for the accumulation of i-fxn in Fig. 1 A. To determine the rates of p → i and i → m processing, radiolabeled p-fxn was incubated with an excess of yeast MPP, and aliquots were analyzed at different time points. Whereas most input p-fxn was converted to i-fxn within the first 5′ of incubation, less than 20% of i-fxn was converted to m-fxn after an additional 25′ (Fig. 3 A). Determination of the initial rates of the p → i and i → m reactions showed that the first reaction is 40 times faster than the second (Fig. 3 B). Under similar experimental conditions, the yeast frataxin precursor was rapidly and quantitatively processed to the mature form in two steps (not shown), raising the possibility that species specificity may be important for the i → m reaction. Indeed, recombinant rat MPP cleaved p-fxn more efficiently as compared with yeast MPP (Fig. 4 A). The input p-fxn was almost completely processed to i-fxn in 5′, and i-fxn was quantitatively converted to the mature form after an additional 25′. Nevertheless, the initial rate of the p → i reaction was 12 times faster than that of the i → m reaction (Fig. 4 B). Previous studies have shown that processing of the intermediate form of Yfh1p is impaired in yeast cells with defects in the mitochondrial Hsp70 homologue, Ssq1 (11Knight S.A. Sepuri N.B. Pain D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18389-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 15Voisine C. Schilke B. Ohlson M. Beinert H. Marszalek J. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3677-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This suggests that a human homologue of Ssq1 or some other mitochondrial protein may be required for the maturation of human frataxin. In such a case, two-step processing of p-fxn should be more efficient upon import into intact mitochondria, that contain MPP and presumably all other factors involved in the maturation of frataxin in vivo. This prediction was not confirmed experimentally, however. Whereas >50% of the input p-fxn was rapidly imported and processed to i-fxn by isolated rat liver mitochondria (Fig. 5 A, lane 3), <20% of this i-fxn was converted to the mature form after 60′ of incubation (lane 6). Because i-fxn was protected from externally added proteinase K (lane 7), lack of i-fxn processing did not result from incomplete translocation of i-fxn. Given that human frataxin is highly expressed in heart and significantly"
https://openalex.org/W2002872805,"We show experimentally and theoretically that two readily observed effects in solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-radiation damping and the dipolar field-combine to generate bizarre spin dynamics (including chaotic evolution) even with extraordinarily simple sequences. For example, seemingly insignificant residual magnetization after a crusher gradient triggers exponential regrowth of the magnetization, followed by aperiodic turbulent spin motion. The estimated Lyapunov exponent suggests the onset of spatial-temporal chaos and the existence of chaotic attractors. This effect leads to highly irreproducible experimental decays that amplify minor nonuniformities such as temperature gradients. Imaging applications and consequences for other NMR studies are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2012570195,"Abstract Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G-1 (eIF4G) plays a critical role in the recruitment of mRNA to the 43 S preinitiation complex. The central region of eIF4G binds the ATP-dependent RNA helicase eIF4A, the 40 S binding factor eIF3, and RNA. In the present work, we have further characterized the binding properties of the central region of human eIF4G. Both titration and competition experiments were consistent with a 1:1 stoichiometry for eIF3 binding. Surface plasmon resonance studies showed that three recombinant eIF4G fragments corresponding to amino acids 642–1560, 613–1078, and 975–1078 bound eIF3 with similar kinetics. A dissociation equilibrium constant of ∼42 nm was derived from an association rate constant of 3.9 × 104 m −1 s−1 and dissociation rate constant of 1.5 × 10−3 s−1. Thus, the eIF3-binding region is included within amino acid residues 975–1078. This region does not overlap with the RNA-binding site, which suggests that eIF3 binds eIF4G directly and not through an RNA bridge, or the central eIF4A-binding site. Surprisingly, the binding of eIF3 and eIF4A to the central region was mutually cooperative; eIF3 binding to eIF4G increased 4-fold in the presence of eIF4A, and conversely, eIF4A binding to the central (but not COOH-terminal) region of eIF4G increased 2.4-fold in the presence of eIF3."
https://openalex.org/W2152929241,"Overexpression of multidrug resistance genes and their encoded P-glycoproteins is a major mechanism for the development of multidrug resistance in cancer cells. The hepatocarcinogen 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) efficiently activates rat mdr1b expression. However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that a NF-κB site on the mdr1b promoter was required for this induction. Overexpression of antisense p65 and IκBα partially abolished the induction. We then delineated the pathway through which 2-AAF activates NF-κB. 2-AAF treatment led to the increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) which causes activation of IKK kinases, degradation of IκBβ (but not IκBα), and increase in NF-κB DNA binding activity. Consistent with the idea that ROS may participate in mdr1b regulation, antioxidant N-acetylcysteine inhibited the induction of mdr1b by 2-AAF. Overproduction of a physiological antioxidant glutathione (GSH) blocked the activation of IKK kinase complex and NF-κB DNA binding. Based on these results, we conclude that 2-AAF up-regulates mdr1b through the generation of ROS, activation of IKK kinase, degradation of IκBβ, and subsequent activation of NF-κB. This is the first report that reveals the specific cis-elements and signaling pathway responsible for the induction of mdr1b by the chemical carcinogen 2-AAF."

Cooper J. et al.Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). Many studies have suggested that CBP/p300 is critically involved in the control of development, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (9Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 10Giles R.H. Peters D.J. Breuning M.H. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 178-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Most studies of CBP/p300 have focused on their functions as transcriptional coactivator (1Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 11Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Consequently, the activities of CBP/p300 have been proposed as essential and integral for many fundamental biological events (9Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 12Janknecht R. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 951-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Precisely how CBP/p300 activates transcription remains uncertain, however. CBP/p300 have been shown to interact with RNA polymerase II and several other general transcription factors required for gene activation (11Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9009-9013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), suggesting a role as a transcriptional integrator or adaptor. CBP/p300 have also been found to contain histone/factor acetyltransferase (HAT/FAT) activities (16Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2387) Google Scholar, 17Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

Through the activities of intrinsic or associated HATs, CBP/p300 may activate transcription through acetylating histones or other transcription factors (19Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T.

Compared with the extensive analysis of the CBP/p300 transcriptional and HAT activities, little effort has been devoted to understanding the regulation of CBP/p300 function. Binding of E1A to CBP/p300 inhibits its HAT and transcriptional activities (4Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 5Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H.

Cell. 1999; 96: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), although the precise mechanism of this inhibition remains unclear. E1A has been proposed to interact directly with the CBP/p300 HAT domains, as well as to disrupt the interactions of associated HATs, such as P/CAF (26Giordano A. Avantaggiati M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 218-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Interactions between CBP/p300 and components of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex may also be disrupted by E1A (14Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar); SV40 T antigen is also able to interact with p300 and repress p300-mediated transcription activation (27Avantaggiati M.L. Carbone M. Graessmann A. Nakatani Y. Howard B. Levine A.S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2236-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway allows pp90rsk to associate with CBP and inhibit cAMP-mediated gene transcription in a manner similar to E1A (28Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Surprisingly few studies have addressed the role of phosphorylation in regulating CBP/p300 function. Phosphorylated p300 has been found in both quiescent and proliferating cells, and the level of p300 phosphorylation changes along with cell cycle progression (29Yaciuk P. Moran E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5389-5397Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Several recent reports have suggested that CBP/p300 may be phosphorylated by various kinases that are important in either cell cycle regulation or different signal transduction pathways, and these phosphorylation events have been speculated to affect various CBP/p300 activities (12Janknecht R. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 951-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 30Xu L. Lavinsky R.M. Dasen J.S. Flynn S.E. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Heinzel T. Szeto D.

Neuron. 1999; 22: 799-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear for the most part which kinases are responsible for CBP/p300 phosphorylation in vivo and where the phosphorylation sites occur. More importantly, the functional links between specific phosphorylation events and CBP/p300 activities remain largely unknown. Elucidating the nature of CBP/p300 phosphorylation is essential for understanding the regulation of CBP/p300 function. To address these issues, we examined the phosphorylation of p300in vivo. We first identified a major p300 phosphorylation site and then determined that protein kinase C (PKC) was responsible for phosphorylation of this site in vivo. By utilizing a p300 construct bearing a point mutation at the phosphorylation site, we examined the effect of the phosphorylation on p300 function. Our data suggest that phosphorylation of p300 represses the transcriptional activity of p300. p300 fragments fused to GST on beads were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP) plus HeLa nuclear extracts (10–50 μg) (34Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). The beads were washed with BC400 (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 400 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA) containing 1% Triton X-100. The proteins were eluted in Laemmli's buffer and separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. PKC kinase assays (35Johnson J.E. Edwards A.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30787-30792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were carried out in the kinase buffer supplemented with 0.5 mm CaCl2, 100 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, using the p300 fragment (amino acids 74–163) fused to GST (rp300n) on beads as substrate. Either purified PKC βII (100 ng) or other PKC isotypes immunoprecipitated from HeLa whole cell lysate or nuclear extracts (200–500 μg) were used in the assays (36Uberall F. Giselbrecht S. Hellbert K. Fresser F. Bauer B. Gschwendt M. Grunicke H.H. Baier G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4072-4078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). HeLa nuclear extracts adjusted to 350 mm KCl were immunoprecipitated with anti-p300-specific monoclonal antibodies (29Yaciuk P. Moran E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5389-5397Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and digested directly for MS analysis. Alternatively, proteins were separated first on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and stained with Ponceau S (Sigma). The desired bands were excised and minced into 1–2-mm pieces. Trypsin digestion and cyanogen bromide (CNBr, Aldrich) cleavage were carried out as described (37Fernandez J. Andrews L. Mische S.M. Anal Biochem. 1994; 218: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 38Luo K.X. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). CNBr-cleaved peptides were further digested in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) with endoproteinase Glu-C (Sigma) overnight at 37 °C. Manual Edman sequencing of labeled peptides was carried out precisely as described (39Sullivan S. Wong T.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, peptides were immobilized covalently on an acrylamide-Sequelon disc (Millipore) using 10 mg/ml 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide in 0.1m Mes (pH 5.0). The unbound peptides were removed by washing the disc with trifluoroacetic acid and methanol. The discs were then transferred into an Eppendorf tube and subjected to Edman degradation. HeLa cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum in 10-cm dishes at 80% confluency were used for metabolic labeling. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fed with 3 ml of either phosphate-free or methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. 32P-labeled orthophosphate or [35S]methionine was added to the corresponding dishes (1 mCi/dish), which were then incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The medium was aspirated, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline before harvesting. The CNBr-cleaved peptides were dissolved in pH 1.9 buffer containing 88% formic acid, acetic acid, and deionized H2O (25:78:897) and loaded onto a cellulose plate (20 × 20 cm). First-dimension electrophoresis was carried out at 1 kV for 30 min in pH 1.9 buffer. Second-dimension chromatography was developed in buffer containing 1-butanol, pyridine, acetic acid, and deionized H2O (15:10:3:12) for 6–8 h. The protein digest from immunoprecipitated p300 was applied to a Targa 0.5 × 150-mm C18 column (Higgins Analytical) using a 10 μl/min flow rate. Mobile phases contained 0.1% acetic acid and peptides were eluted with a 0–32% acetonitrile gradient over 80 min followed by a 32–65% acetonitrile gradient over 10 min. Peptides were analyzed on-line by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS) using an LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan) to measure both peptide whole masses (MS) and masses of peptide fragments produced by collision-induced dissociation (MS/MS). Initial experiments detected potential phosphopeptides whose abundance was too low to trigger data dependent MS/MS scans. Therefore, the instrument was programmed to specifically select these ions for MS/MS analysis. Relative collision energy of 40% was used, with a maximum ion time of 500 ms. A total of 8 microscans was summed for each MS/MS spectra. A phosphoserine 89-specific antiserum was prepared by immunizing rabbits with a p300-derived oligopeptide containing phosphoserine 89 (RSGSpSPNLNMGV). The specificity of the antiserum was examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated oligopeptides at various concentrations. Subsequently, the antiserum was tested by Western analysis using various amounts of nonphosphorylated rp300n and rp300n phosphorylated by HeLa nuclear extracts. In both the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western analyses, the antiserum recognized the serine 89-phosphorylated protein with a high degree of specificity. The optimal dilution of the antiserum was used in Western analysis of immunoprecipitated p300 to measure the level of serine 89 phosphorylation in vivo. HeLa cells at 50% confluency in 10-cm plates were transfected with LipofectAMINE (16 μl, Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer. The cells for transfection with the ER construct were grown in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% dextran-coated charcoal-treated fetal calf serum (40Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Ethanol (as a control) or estradiol (E2, 10 nm) dissolved in ethanol was added 1 h post-transfection. One or two days after transfection, the cells were lysed in 100 μl of buffer (15Yuan W. Condorelli G. Caruso M. Felsani A. Giordano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9009-9013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) followed by a CAT assay using the organic phase extraction procedure (11Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). CAT activity was normalized against cotransfected β-galactosidase activity (15Yuan W. Condorelli G. Caruso M. Felsani A. Giordano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9009-9013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To identify the sites of p300 phosphorylation, we examined a series of bacterially expressed recombinant fragments representing the entire length of p300. Only the N-terminal 243-amino acid fragment (rp300N) was phosphorylated after incubation with HeLa nuclear extracts (Fig. 1 A). This region contains many potential phosphorylation sites. To identify these sites, we first digested the phosphorylated rp300N protein with trypsin. Tryptic peptides were separated by HPLC using a reverse phase C18 column (VYDAC, 218TP52) (Fig. 1 B), and each fraction was monitored by Cerenkov counting in a scintillation counter. Two major radiolabeled fractions (peaks A and B at retention times of 61 and 70 min, respectively) were detected, and these were subjected to automated Edman sequencing. Both fractions contained peptides with N-terminal residues corresponding to position 87 in p300. The two radiolabeled fractions were further digested with CNBr, separated by HPLC, and again subjected to automated sequencing. Residue 87 was again identified as the N terminus of the radiolabeled peptide. The labeled peptide 87SGSSPNLNh95 (where h is either homoserine or homoserine lactone derived from methionine by CNBr cleavage) contains serines at positions 87, 89, and 90. Manual Edman degradation (39Sullivan S. Wong T.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was used to further characterize the radiolabeled tryptic peptide collected from peak A. At each cycle, both the eluted solution and the filter bearing the remaining peptide were subjected to Cerenkov counting. Only serine 89 at cycle 3 was labeled (Fig. 1 C), indicating the site of phosphorylation. Mutating residue 89 from serine to alanine in the recombinant p300 N-terminal construct (rp300NS89A) markedly decreased the level of phosphorylation (Fig. 1 D) and completely eliminated labeling of the CNBr peptide as measured by two-dimensional peptide mapping (Fig. 1 E). These observations suggest that serine 89 is a major phosphorylation site of the rp300N fragment of p300 in vitro. To determine whether serine 89 is phosphorylated in vivo, we metabolically labeled the endogenous p300 protein by growing HeLa cells in 32P. Two-dimensional peptide mapping of the labeled p300 after digestion with CNBr revealed a labeled phosphopeptide that migrated at the same position as the radiolabeled peptide from rp300N (Fig. 1 E). Thus, we presume that serine 89 is also phosphorylated in endogenous p300. To test this hypothesis further, we used mass spectrometry to identify the phosphorylation site in the endogenous p300. p300 immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts was digested with CNBr and endoproteinase Glu-C. The digested peptides were subjected to online capillary liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS/MS). During ionization, the peptide bearing serine 89 (84LLRSGSSPNLNh95) could be either singly or doubly charged. The calculated ratios of mass to charge (m/z) are 1240.7 and 620.8 for the unphosphorylated species, and 1320.7 and 660.8 for the species phosphorylated at one residue. Ions with either the expectedm/z value for the unphosphorylated or phosphorylated peptides eluted at 37.9 and 41.8 min, respectively (Fig. 2 A). Them/z values 1240.9 and 620.9 measured in the MS spectra were assigned to the unphosphorylated peptide, and the values 1320.8 and 660.7 were assigned to the phosphorylated peptide. These peptide ions were further isolated and subjected to collision-induced dissociation to produce MS/MS spectra. This caused fragmentation of the parent ions along peptide bonds to produce both y fragment ions (loss of successive residues from the N terminus) and bfragment ions (loss of successive residues from the C terminus). The identity of the unphosphorylated peptide was confirmed by the presence of 15 of 22 possible b and y series ions in the MS/MS spectra. The MS/MS spectra for the phosphorylated parent ions determined the identity of the phosphopeptide and the phosphorylation site at serine 89. Fig. 2 B shows a MS/MS spectrum for the doubly charged phosphopeptide ion. The dominant peak with anm/z value of 611.9 in the spectrum is consistent with the loss of one phosphate from the parent ion. Sixteenb ions and 11 y ions were also assigned. Six of these b ions and two of these y ions resulted from the additional loss of phosphate (bΔ andyΔ). Based on the m/z values, none of the b2–b5 and y2–y6, which contained serine 87 and 90, respectively, but not serine 89, were phosphorylated. On the other hand, the b6–b11 and y7–y10, which contained serine 89, were phosphorylated and were able to lose phosphoric acid. This sequence information obtained from the MS/MS spectrum provides unambiguous evidence that serine 89 is an in vivo site of p300 phosphorylation. To detect serine 89-phosphorylated endogenous p300 easily, we made a phosphoserine 89-specific antiserum. The specificity of the antiserum was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated oligopeptides (data not shown) and then by Western analysis using various amounts of nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated recombinant p300 fragment rp300n (amino acids 74–163), which contains serine 89 (Fig. 3 A). In both cases, the antiserum recognized the serine 89-phosphorylated protein with a high degree of specificity. In addition, serine 89 phosphorylation of p300 could be detected by the antiserum when a Flag-tagged p300 was transfected and expressed in HeLa cells but not when a Flag-tagged p300 bearing a point mutation at serine 89 to alanine was expressed (Fig. 3 B). We subsequently used the antiserum to detect endogenous p300 phosphorylated at serine 89 in different cell lines (Fig. 3 C). The serine 89-specific phosphorylation of p300 in these cells suggests that this phosphorylation is a common phenomenon. Each of the N-terminal sequences of human and mouse p300 and CBP contains a consensus (RXXS) phosphorylation site similar to that used by PKC (45Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 46Hofmann J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) (Table I). This observation prompted us to test whether PKC was able to phosphorylate rp300n. Purified PKC βII, a classical PKC isotype, phosphorylated rp300n but not its serine 89 to alanine point mutant (rp300nS89A) (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, PKA (cAMP-dependent kinase) and CaM kinase IV (calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase), which also recognize RXXS phosphorylation sites (45Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar) failed to phosphorylate serine 89 of p300 (data not shown). However, PKC βII was not detected in HeLa nuclear extracts (Fig. 4 B), and therefore it was not the kinase we were looking for. By Western analysis, we found that several isotypes of PKC exist in HeLa nuclei. Of them, only a classical type α and a novel type δ were shown to exist in both HeLa nuclei and phosphorylate serine 89 in rp300n specifically (Fig. 4,A and B).Table IAlignment of human and mouse CBP/p300 N-terminal sequencesp300 human84 LLRSGSSPNLNMG 96p300 mouse84 LLRSGSSPNLNMG 96CBP human73 LLRGGSGSSINPG 85CBP mouse72 LLRGGSGSSINPG 84Kinase consensus 1-aRXXS is similar to phosphorylation consensus used by cAMP-dependent kinases (PKA), cGMP-dependent kinases, calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases, and protein kinase C.. .

Open table in a new tab To test whether PKC mediates phosphorylation of p300 at serine 89in vivo, we treated HeLa and U2OS cells with calphostin C (47Xu J. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Calphostin C inhibits PKC specifically by interacting with its regulatory C1 domain (48Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar), which is common in all PKC isotypes and binds to its key activator, diacylglycerol (49Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Levels of serine 89-phosphorylated p300 were measured using the phosphoserine 89-specific antiserum. The level of the serine 89-phosphorylated p300 was reduced markedly in calphostin C-treated cells, whereas the level of total p300 protein did not change (Fig. 4 C). Thus, we suggest that PKC mediates phosphorylation of p300 at serine 89 in different cells. We next investigated whether phosphorylation at serine 89 affected p300 function. Expression constructs containing a Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to either wild type human p300 (Galp300) or a cDNA containing a point mutation at serine 89 to alanine (Galp300S89A) were used in this study. When transfected into HeLa cells, the wild type and point mutant fusion proteins were expressed at the same level (Fig. 5 A). The point mutant was significantly more active than the wild type p300, however, when tested using a CAT reporter driven by Gal4 binding sites (Fig. 5 B). These observations suggest that phosphorylation at serine 89 repress the transcriptional ability of p300. We further tested whether the p300 point mutation affected transcription of specific promoters. For these studies, we utilized promoters containing an ER-binding site or activator protein-1 (AP-1) site derived from the collagenase gene (40Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 50Lee J.S. See R.H. Deng T. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4312-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The serine 89 to alanine point mutant was also more active than the wild type p300 in potentiating both promoters (Fig. 5, Cand D). These observations indicate that phosphorylation of p300 at serine 89 represses its ability as a transcriptional coactivator and thus suppresses the ER and AP-1 activities. Phosphorylation is known to be an important mode of transcription factor regulation. Components of the basal transcriptional machinery and elements of chromatin are also regulated by phosphorylation. Surprisingly, despite the essential roles of CBP/p300 in transcriptional signaling, characterization of their regulation by phosphorylation remains relatively unexplored. Several studies have suggested that CBP and p300 are phosphorylated (12Janknecht R. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 951-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 30Xu L.

Neuron. 1999; 22: 799-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), but in most of these cases, it remains unclear which kinases are responsible for CBP/p300 phosphorylation in vivo and which specific residues are phosphorylated. Here, we present the first identification of an in vivo phosphorylation site in CBP/p300, characterize the responsible kinase, and demonstrate the repression of p300 function by this phosphorylation. These observations indicate that p300 and presumably CBP are indeed regulated by phosphorylation. Serine 89 of p300 and its surrounding PKC consensus sequence (RXXS) are conserved among human and mouse p300 and CBP. Similar to p300, an N-terminal fragment of CBP (amino acids 1–270) containing the corresponding serine was phosphorylated by PKC. 2L. W. Yuan, unpublished data. This highly conserved phosphorylation, plus its inhibitory role in the regulation of p300 function, implies its importance in cellular control. p300 was identified originally through its ability to interact with the adenoviral E1A oncoprotein. To achieve a full level of cellular transformation, E1A must bind to both Rb and p300, which implies important regulatory roles for both of these cellular factors in cell growth (3Arany Z. Sellers W.R. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1994; 77: 799-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 51Moran E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Rb is well known as a tumor suppressor and a G1 checkpoint regulator. Inactivation of Rb via phosphorylation by G1 cyclin-dependent kinases is crucial to cell cycle progression. Recent studies show that CBP and p300 are also tumor suppressors (1Eckner R. Ewen M.E.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1565-1569PubMed Google Scholar). The requirement for CBP/p300 in cell proliferation has been shown in studies using p300-deficient mice (54Yao T.P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.D. Ch'ng L.E. Newsome D. Bronson R.T. Li E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar) and after ribozyme ablation of CBP/p300 in tissue culture (55Kawasaki H. Eckner R. Yao T.P. Taira K. Chiu R. Livingston D.M. Yokoyama K.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Both studies suggest that the level of CBP/p300 is critical to its role in the regulation of proliferation. Little is known about how CBP/p300 subserves this function, however, or whether the growth/tumor suppressor actions of CBP/p300 are similarly regulated by phosphorylation. Our observations that phosphorylation at serine 89 by PKC represses p300 function suggest a mechanism by which p300 could down-regulate cell growth. Conceivably, the loss of the serine 89-phosphorylation sites in the fusions of MOZ and MLL to CBP or p300 could contribute to the mechanisms that link these translocations to the development of hematological malignancies (10Giles R.H. Peters D.J. Breuning M.H. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 178-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The PKC family of proteins are signal-activated kinases of importance in major cellular functions. Release of diacylglycerol and calcium stimulate PKC activity within a short period of time, whereas tumor-promoting phorbol esters (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) may regulate PKC activity within a relative long term (56Asaoka Y. Nakamura S. Yoshida K. Nishizuka Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 414-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The PKC isotypes play distinct roles in the regulation of growth and differentiation depending on which cell types are being examined (57Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Our studies show that PKCα and PKCδ have the ability to phosphorylate p300 at serine 89 and repress its function in HeLa cells. This regulation thus represents a previously unsuspected signal transduction pathway for PKC to participate in cellular controls. Consistent with this hypothesis, p300 is expected to participate in certain differentiation pathways (4Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) and overexpression of PKCα and PKCδ upon phorbol ester stimulation-induced differentiation in a mouse myeloid progenitor cell line (58Mischak H. Pierce J.H. Goodnight J. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20110-20115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This induction of differentiation by PKCα and PKCδ may be mediated in part by phosphorylation of p300. In addition, CBP/p300 as well as PKCα and PKCδ express universally in many different tissues (51Moran E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 56Asaoka Y. Nakamura S. Yoshida K. Nishizuka Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 414-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), indicating a possible global event of phosphorylation of p300 at serine 89 by PKCα and PKCδ. Indeed, we detected phosphorylation of p300 at serine 89 in all of the cell lines examined. Previous studies showed that the C-terminal fragments of CBP could be phosporylated in vitro by cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase (32Ait-Si-Ali S. Ramirez S. Barre F.X. Dkhissi F. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Girault J.A. Robin P. Knibiehler M. Pritchard L.L. Ducommun B. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 396: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation caused an increase in the HAT activity of CBP. This observation, combined with our study here, suggests that there are two types of regulation by phosphorylation in CBP/p300: a positive effect by phosphorylation, causing a short term stimulation of function, and a repressive effect by phosphorylation at serine 89, possibly serving a checkpoint to CBP/p300 function. In summary, our findings suggest that p300 is phosphorylated at serine 89 by PKC and that this phosphorylation represses its function. It will be particularly interesting to investigate whether this phosphorylation and repression event of p300 is regulated in the cell cycle and how this event contributes to specific cellular decisions, such as withdrawal from the cell cycle and differentiation.

It is also apparent that individual members of the MyD118/GADD45/CR6 family are differentially induced by a variety of genetic and environmental stress agents. The MyD118, CR6, and GADD45 proteins were shown to predominantly localize within the cell nucleus.

Also, in recent years it has become increasingly evident that both the molecular basis for the initial increase in the susceptibility of malignant cells to anti-cancer agents and the development of treatment resistance originate from genetic lesions that alter the function of genes that play a role in normal cell homeostasis, notably in determining cell cycle progression and the apoptotic set point (2Muschel R.J.

Thus, understanding the molecular genetic pathways that mediate negative growth control is of high priority from both a basic science and cancer therapeutic point of view. To this end, cDNA clones of myeloid differentiation primary response (MyD)1 genes, activated in M1 myeloblastic leukemia cells, in the absence of de novo protein synthesis, upon induc-tion of terminal differentiation associated with growth arrest and apoptosis were isolated and characterized (4Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Stem Cells. 1994; 12: 352-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 5Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Steinman R.A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 199-210PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lord K.A. Abdollahi A. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 637-645PubMed Google Scholar). In the course of this work several novel MyD genes were isolated including MyD118 (7Abdollahi A. Lord K.A. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 165-167PubMed Google Scholar). The MyD118 gene product was found to be remarkably similar to protein encoded by GADD45, a growth arrest- and DNA damage-induced gene, regulated in part by the p53 tumor suppressor gene (8Fornace Jr., A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 9Fornace Jr., A.J. Jackman J. Hollander M.C. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

A third member of theMyD118/GADD45 family, CR6(cytokine response gene 6), was originally identified as an immediate early response gene in T cells stimulated by interleukin-2 (10Beadling C.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6573-6582Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recently, the full-length sequences of murine and human CR6 cDNAs have been determined (12Zhang W. Bae I. Krishnaraju K.

Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). It has become evident that the MyD118/CR6/GADD45 gene family encodes for small (18 kDa) evolutionarily conserved proteins that are highly homologous to each other (55–58% overall identity at the amino acid level) (13Takekawa M. Saito H. Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), are highly acidic (pI∼4.0–4.2), and are primarily localized within the cell nucleus. Data have accumulated to indicate that MyD118/CR6/GADD45 serve similar but not identical functions along different apoptotic and growth suppressive pathways. For example, it was observed thatMyD118, but not GADD45, is activated upon transforming growth factor-β1-induced apoptosis. On the other hand, GADD45, but not MyD118 or CR6, was identified as target for p53 function (14Selvakumaran M. Lin H.K. Sjin R.T. Reed J.C. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Mol. Cell.

All three genes appear to be induced with different expression kinetics during terminal hematopoietic differentiation, which is associated with growth arrest and apoptosis (12Zhang W. Bae I.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4899-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Importantly, it became evident that individual members of theMyD118/CR6/GADD45 family are differentially induced by a variety of genetic and environmental stress agents, suggesting that each gene is optimally induced by a certain subset of environmental stresses (13Takekawa M.

All three proteins interact with and activate the stress-responsive MTK1/MEKK4, which is an upstream activator of the p38/JNK kinase pathways (19Takekawa M. Posas F. Saito H.

Given the central role assigned for PCNA in cell proliferation and its identification as a cellular partner for MyD118 and GADD45, in this work we sought to determine whether CR6 interacts with PCNA, and if so, to dissect CR6/PCNA interacting domains and analyze their relevance for negative growth control. We show that PCNA domains, which previously were identified to mediate interaction with MyD118 and GADD45, also mediate interaction with CR6. PCNA interacting domains within CR6 were localized to the C terminus of the protein, similar to what was observed with MyD118 and GADD45 (1Vairapandi M. Azam N. Balliet A.G. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16810-16819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). CR6, like MyD118 and GADD45, also is shown to interact with p21. Importantly, it is shown that interaction of CR6 with PCNA, like interactions of MyD118 and GADD45 (1Vairapandi M. Azam N. Balliet A.G. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. J. Biol.

H1299 and 293T cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2 (293T were cultured at 5% CO2). H1299 and 293T cells were cultured to give 60–80% confluency at the time of transfection. One day before transfection H1299 cells were plated at 1.2 million cells/100-mm dish, and 293T cells were plated at 3 million cells/l00-mm dish. The murine myeloid leukemic M1 cell line was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere with 10% CO2 at 37 °C. One day before purified human rIL-6 (100 ng/ml) (Amgen Inc) treatment, 0.1 million M1 cells were plated per 150-mm dish. Manipulation of Escherichia coli and DNA was performed according to standard methods (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed with the CLONTECH Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System-2, essentially as described in the CLONTECH protocol. Full-length murine CR6 cDNA in pBluescript (12Zhang W. Bae I. Krishnaraju K. Azam N. Fan W. Smith K. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4899-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and human PCNA in p3038-T7hPCNA (30Fien K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) were used to generate all the deletion constructs of CR6/PCNA. Deletion mutants were constructed by taking advantage of unique restriction enzyme sites within the coding sequence of these cDNAs. Full-length cDNAs and truncated cDNAs encoding for deletion peptides were cloned in-frame into pAct2 (GAL4 activation domain: “trap”) as well as into the modified pAS2.1 (GAL4 DNA-binding domain: “bait”) vector. All of the constructs were sequenced to verify in-frame cloning. Transformation into yeast strain Y187 was performed according to CLONTECH protocol. Yeast strain Y187 was used for testing interaction by activation of the β-Gal gene (blue selection). Yeast strains CG1945 or Y190 were used to test interaction by activation of the histidine gene. Interaction assays were conducted only with pAct2/pAS2.1 constructs that tested negative for self-activation. Interactions either positive (+) or negative (−) were ascertained by both β-Gal expression (blue selection) and histidine expression (histidine selection). Quantitation of relative binding affinities of protein and deletion peptides was determined in yeast strain Y187. Three positive double transfectants were selected on minimal medium plates for each transfection and grown overnight in liquid selection minimal medium. The expression of β-Gal was quantified, according to the CLONTECH protocol, with O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as the substrate, and the intensity of yellow color development was measured colorimetrically at 420 nm. For in vitro association assays, full-length PCNA and Bax cDNA coding sequences were cloned into pET14b (18Vairapandi M. Balliet A.G. Fornace Jr., A.J. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2579-2594PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length p21 was cloned into pcDNA3. HA-tagged full-length CR6 and C-terminal peptide coding sequences were cloned into HApcDNA3.1(−), kindly provided by Dr. Dhanasekaran. Full-length CR6 and the C-terminal peptide sequences were cloned into the unique EcoRI site of HApcDNA3.1(−). N-terminal peptide encoding cDNAs were generated by truncating and linearizing full-length CR6 cDNA in HApcDNA3.1(−) with unique restriction enzymes at the required sites, and were then used in the transcription/translation reaction (TNT; Promega). PCNA 87–261 aa (EcoRV-NdeI Fragment) was cloned in-frame into the pAS2.1 vector. Subsequently, PCNA 87–127 aa (NdeI-EcoRI fragment from pAS2.1) and PCNA 87–149 aa (NdeI-BglII fragment from pAS2.1) were excised and cloned in-frame into pET23b (Novagen), which was used in the TNT reaction. Constructs were purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation and suspended in DNase and RNase free H2O. The T7 based coupled transcription/translation system, with rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TNT; Promega) and Easy Tag L-[35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), was used to produce radiolabeled proteins and peptides. In vitrointeraction experiments were done as described (18Vairapandi M. Balliet A.G. Fornace Jr., A.J. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2579-2594PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of 35S-labeled PCNA, Bax, and CR6 protein/peptides were mixed together (105 cpm each) in 200 μl of interaction buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Tween 20, and 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). 35S-Labeled Bax was added to all reactions as an internal negative control for interaction. Each interaction reaction was carried out, in triplicate, for 30 min on ice. Subsequently each reaction mix was nonspecifically immunoprecipitated with rabbit IgG or mouse IgG for 1 h. Following pulling down of nonspecific immune complexes with protein A/G-agarose beads (Oncogene Sciences), supernatants were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation with specific primary antibodies: PCNA (PC10; Santa Cruz), p21 (Ab-5; Calbiochem), Bax (N20; Santa Cruz), and HA (Y11; Santa Cruz). Immune complexes were pulled down with protein A/G-agarose beads. Beads were washed four times with interaction buffer A (without bovine serum albumin), suspended in Laemmeli protein loading buffer, heated at 75 °C for 10 min, and loaded on 15% SDS-PAGE gel for analysis. Following electrophoresis the gels were fixed with 25% isopropanol in 10% acetic acid, subjected to fluorography with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and vacuum dried before exposure to x-ray film. For the in vivo interaction studies, the HA tag epitope sequences in the mammalian expression vector HApcDNA3.1(−) were used. 10 μg of the pcDNA3 constructs encoding for Bax, p21, or HA-tagged CR6 full-length protein or deletion peptides were transiently transfected into 293T or H1299 cells, using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 24 h, transfected cells were trypsinized, washed twice with PBS, and lysed in 3.0 ml of interaction buffer containing protease inhibitors including phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, aprotonin, and pepstatin A (Sigma). Triplicate 1.0-ml aliquots of cell lysates were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation, as described above for the in vitroassociation assay, using Bax, p21, HA, PCNA antibodies, or nonspecific rabbit or mouse IgG. Immune complexes were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE gel. The protein bands were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-EC; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Western probed with HA antibodies, and visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were reprobed with PCNA antibodies after stripping the blot according to the manufacturer's protocol. At 48 h after IL-6 treatment, M1 cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and lysed in 0.4 ml of buffer containing protease inhibitors, as described previously. Triplicate 1.0-ml aliquots of diluted cell lysates (200 μg) were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation as described above for in vitro association assay, using p21, CR6, PCNA antibodies, or nonspecific rabbit or mouse IgG. Immune complexes were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE gel. The protein bands were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, Western probed with p21, CR6, PCNA antibodies, and visualized by ECL. A short term transfection assay was used to assess the ability of full-length CR6 protein and N- or C-terminal peptides to suppress colony formation in H1299 cells (18Vairapandi M. Balliet A.G. Fornace Jr., A.J. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2579-2594PubMed Google Scholar,31Zhan Q. Lord K.A. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Carrier F. Ron D. Kohn K.W. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2361-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). pTK-hyg was obtained from CLONTECH, Inc. Briefly, H1299 cells were co-transfected by the LipofectAMINE method with 0.5 μg of pTK-hyg together with 10 μg of empty HApcDNA3.1(−) construct (negative control) or HApcDNA3.1(−) encoding for HA-tagged full-length CR6 protein or N/C-terminal peptides. pTK-hyg was used for hygromycin selection and as an internal normalization control for transfection efficiency. Co-transfections were performed in 60-mm tissue culture dishes. One day following transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and trypsinized. The cells were replated in duplicates with hygromycin-containing medium (200 μg/ml) and incubated for 14 days to allow colonies to develop. Then the medium was removed, and colonies were washed once with PBS and fixed with 75% methanol in 25% acetic acid for 5 min, and the plates were dried. Colonies were stained with Lillie's crystal violet (2 g of crystal violet and 0.8 g of ammonium oxalate in 80% ethanol) for 5 min and subsequently washed with deionized water to remove excess stain. Stained colonies containing more than 10 cells were scored and counted. The percentage of colony formation was normalized to colonies formed following transfection with empty HApcDNA3.1(−). pcDNA3 encoding p53 or p21 were co-transfected with pTK-hyg as positive controls. pcDNA3 encoding for antisense CR6 was used as an additional negative control. H1299 cells growing on coverslips in 35-mm tissue culture dishes were co-transfected with 2 μg of CR6 construct (in HApcDNA3.1(−)) and 0.2 μg of β-Gal expression vector (pSV-β-Gal; Promega) using the LipofectAMINE method. β-Gal expression and apoptosis were analyzed 72 h following transfection. The cells were washed once with PBS and fixed for 10 min with 0.05% glutaraldehyde in PBS. Following three washes with PBS to remove the fixative, X-gal solution (20 mm potassium ferricyanide, 20 mm potassium ferrocyanide, l mm magnesium sulfate in PBS; X-gal is added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml just before use, from a 20 mg/ml stock solution in N,N′-dimethyl formamide) was spread over the dishes, and the dishes were incubated overnight at room temperature. The next day, the X-gal solution was removed, and cell nuclei were stained for 3 min with 0.1 μg/ml Hoechst No.33342 (Sigma) and then washed three times with PBS. The coverslips were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium H-1000 (Vector Labs inc. CA 94010) and analyzed under a Leitz fluorescent microscope. The percentage of apoptotic cells were determined by dividing the number of β-Gal expressing blue cells that exhibit apoptotic nuclear morphology (condensed/fragmented nucleus) by the total number of blue cells. At least 200 cells from five randomly chosen fields were analyzed for each experiment. Previously we have demonstrated that both MyD118 and GADD45 interact with PCNA and p21. It was, therefore, of interest to determine whether CR6, the third member in this related gene family, interacts with PCNA and/or p21. To this end the yeast two-hybrid system (YTHS) was employed (“Experimental Procedures”). Full-length CR6 was cloned into the Gal4 DNA-binding domain of pAS2.1 YTHS vector. The CR6 construct was co-transfected into yeast with pAct2 YTHS constructs encoding for either PCNA or p21 and fused to the Gal4 activation domain. Interactions, either positive (+) or negative (−) were ascertained by both β-Gal expression (blue color) and histidine expression (histidine selection) (“Experimental Procedures”). Empty pAct2 vector was used as the negative control in the YTHS for both qualitative and quantitative interaction with the full-length CR6 in pAS2.1 vector. As shown in Fig.1 (A and B), full-length CR6 interacted with PCNA. Full-length CR6 interacted also with p21. The relative binding affinities of CR6 interactions with PCNA or p21 were quantified using the YTH liquid culture assay (“Experimental Procedures”). In this assay, the level of β-Gal expression in yeast under control of the interacting partner proteins encoded by pAct2 and pAS2.1 was quantified by measuring the intensity of yellow color development using O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate. As shown in Fig.1 A, CR6 interacted equally strongly with PCNA and p21. To determine whether the interactions of CR6 with PCNA and p21, identified by the YTH approach, reflect direct association between these proteins,in vitro binding assays were performed with35S-labeled PCNA or p21 and full-length HA-tagged CR6 protein that were generated by coupled transcription/translation. The murine Bax protein (pI∼4.7), a bcl-2 partner protein with a mass and charge similar to MyD118, GADD45, and CR6, (pI∼4.0) (32Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5865) Google Scholar), was included as an internal control to monitor the specificity of the binding assay. Equal amounts of 35S-labeled proteins were mixed, and following incubation, the protein mixtures were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific to PCNA, p21, HA epitope, or Bax. As shown in Fig. 1 B, PCNA or p21 were contained within HA-CR6 immune complexes, and CR6 was contained in PCNA or p21 immune complexes (Fig. 1 B). The specificity of these interactions was inferred by the observation that Bax was not contained within PCNA, p21, or HA-CR6 immune complexes. To further establish that these interactions are biologically relevant, M1 cells were treated with IL-6, and the cell lysates were obtained from untreated cells at 0 and 48 h after addition of IL-6. The Western blot analysis of cell lysate shows the abundance of PCNA protein at both 0 and 48 h (Fig. 1 C). CR6 and p21 proteins were absent in untreated cells but were significantly induced at 48 h, as shown in Fig. 1 C. As shown in Fig.1 D, the p21 immune complex obtained from cell lysate after 48 h of IL-6 treatment contained CR6. Reciprocally, the CR6 immune complex contained p21. It can also be seen that the PCNA immune complex, obtained from M1 cell extracts contained CR6. Reciprocally, the CR6 immune complex contained PCNA. Taken together these results demonstrate in vivo association of endogenous CR6 with endogenous p21 and PCNA. Recently, we have observed that similar domains within PCNA, MyD118, and GADD45 mediate interactions between these proteins. Thus, it was of interest to determine whether amino acid domains, which mediate interactions between PCNA and CR6, are similar or different from those found to mediate interactions between PCNA, MyD118, and GADD45. To this end, deletion constructs of PCNA cDNA, encoding for N-terminal, middle, or C-terminal peptides of PCNA were cloned into the Gal4 DNA-binding domain of the pAS2.1 YTHS vector. Each of these constructs were co-transfected into yeast with pAct2 YTHS constructs encoding CR6, fused to the Gal4 activation domain. As mentioned earlier, interactions were ascertained by both β-Gal expression and histidine expression (“Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 2, full-length PCNA interacted with CR6. PCNA C-terminal (PCNA/224–261), N-terminal (PCNA/1–46), and middle (PCNA/87–127) peptides also interacted with CR6. This indicated that these regions of PCNA contained CR6 interacting domains. Consistent with CR6 interacting domains within the N-terminal region of PCNA, also PCNA/1–149 and PCNA/1–127 peptides interacted with CR6. The PCNA/1–223 peptide, however, failed to interact, implying that there is a steric hindrance domain within the 150–223 region of PCNA that inhibited binding to CR6. Consistent with this notion, the 150–223 aa hindrance domain also prevented association of PCNA/128–261 and PCNA/150–261 C-terminal peptides with CR6. PCNA/1–100 and PCNA/1–86 N-terminal peptides also failed to interact with CR6. Because PCNA/1- 46 and PCNA/1–127 did interact with CR6, the data implied that the 47–86 aa region of PCNA, when juxtaposed to the N-terminal 1–46 aa region, in the absence of the 87–127 aa region, hinders binding of PCNA peptides to CR6. The relative binding affinities of different PCNA domains with CR6 were quantified using the YTH liquid culture assay (“Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 2, the interaction between full-length PCNA and full-length CR6 was weaker than the interaction when using PCNA/1–46 or PCNA/87–127 peptides. This observation is consistent with the notion that full-length PCNA in addition to CR6 interacting domain contains domains that hinder interaction. Having mapped domains within PCNA that interact with CR6, next we mapped domains within CR6 that mediate interaction with PCNA. The YTH vector pAS2.1 was used to construct yeast expression vectors that encode for N- and C-terminal deletion peptides of CR6. These deletion peptides were tested for interaction with PCNA cloned in the YTH vector pAct2 (Fig. 3, and see legend). It can be seen that CR6/76–159 interacted with PCNA as well as full-length CR6, whereas CR6/1–135 failed to interact. This indicated that the C-terminal (76–159 aa) region of CR6 harbors a domain that is required for interaction with PCNA. The relative binding affinities of full-length and C-terminal peptides of CR6 with PCNA were quantified using β-Gal expression in yeast and are shown in Fig. 3. Notably, the binding affinity to PCNA of the CR6/76–159 C-terminal peptide was higher than the full-length CR6. Taken together these findings indicate that amino acid domains, which mediate interactions between CR6 and PCNA, are similar to the domains that were observed to mediate interaction between MyD118, GADD45, and PCNA (see Ref. 1Vairapandi M.

https://openalex.org/W2108095498,"We assessed here the effect of the glucocorticoid-regulated protein lipocortin 1 (LC1) in a model of rat myocardial ischemia reperfusion. Treatment of animals with human recombinant LC1 at the end of a 25-min ischemic period significantly reduced the extent of infarct size in the area at risk as measured 2 h later, with ~50% inhibition at the highest dose tested of 50 per rat (equivalent to 5.4 nmol/kg). The protective effect of LC1 was abolished by protein denaturation and not mimicked by the structurally related protein annexin V. A combination of electron and light microscopy techniques demonstrated the occurrence of the myocardial damage at the end of the reperfusion period, with loss of fiber organization. LC1 provided a partial and visible protection. The dose-dependent protection afforded by LC1 was paralleled by lower values of myeloperoxidase activity, tumor necrosis factor α, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α. The functional link between migrated leukocytes and the myocardial damage was confirmed by electron and light microscopy, and a significantly lower number of extravasated leukocytes was counted in the group of rats treated with LC1 (50 μg). In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that LC1 reduces the leukocyte-dependent myocardial damage associated with an ischemia-reperfusion procedure."
https://openalex.org/W2038171923,"Hepatic lipoprotein assembly and secretion can be regulated by proteasomal degradation of newly synthesized apoB, especially if lipid synthesis or lipid transfer is low. Our previous studies in HepG2 cells showed that, under these conditions, newly synthesized apoB remains stably associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Mitchell, D. M., Zhou, M., Pariyarath, R., Wang, H., Aitchison, J. D., Ginsberg, H. N., and Fisher, E. A. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 14733–14738). We now show that independent of lipid synthesis, apoB chains that appear full-length are, in fact, incompletely translated polypeptides still engaged by the ribosome and associated with the ER translocon. In the presence of active lipid synthesis and transfer, translation and lipoprotein assembly are completed, and the complexes exit the ER. Upon omitting fatty acids from, or adding a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor to, culture media to reduce lipid synthesis or transfer, respectively, apoB was degraded while it remained associated with the ER and complexed with cytosolic hsp70 and proteasomes. Thus, unlike other ER substrates of the proteasome, such as major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, apoB does not fully retrotranslocate to the cytosol before entering the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Although, upon immunofluorescence, apoB in proteasome-inhibited cells accumulated in punctate structures similar in appearance to aggresomes (cytosolic structures containing molecules irreversibly lost from the secretory pathway), these apoB molecules could be secreted when lipid synthesis was stimulated. The results suggest a model in which 1) apoB translation does not complete until lipoprotein assembly terminates, and 2) assembly with lipids or entry into the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway occurs while apoB polypeptides remain associated with the translocon and attached to the ribosome.

The regulation of the assembly and secretion of the apoB100-containing lipoproteins has been studied in various hepatic cell models, including the human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2. In human intestine, enterocytes edit the transcript of the apoprotein B gene so that a shorter protein, apoB48, is formed. Because HepG2 cells do not have this editing activity (2Powell L.M. Wallis S.C. Pease R.J. Edwards Y.H. Knott T.J. Scott J. Cell. 1987; 50: 831-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), throughout this report, the abbreviation apoB will refer exclusively to apoB100 and its incompletely translated polypeptides. One of the early steps of apoB-lipoprotein biogenesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1is the association of translocated domains of apoB with its “lipid ligands” in a process mediated by the lipid transfer activity of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) (1Mitchell D.M. Zhou M. Pariyarath R. Wang H. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N. Fisher E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14733-14738Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). After the initial co-translational lipidation of apoB, the remainder of the assembly process is thought to occur post-translationally (3Davis R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). If either the synthesis or transfer of lipid ligands is limited, apoB is rapidly degraded, as illustrated not only by numerous studies in vitro (e.g. Refs. 4Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 167-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 5Yao Z. Tran K. McLeod R.S. J.

We and others have shown in HepG2 cells that most of this metabolically regulated intracellular degradation of apoB occurs through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (7Yeung S.J. Chen S.H. Chan L.

Studies in yeast and mammalian systems have identified the proteasome as the principal means of disposal of a growing list of ER-associated proteins that presumably become misfolded because of either a structural mutation or a failure to assemble properly into a multimeric complex (11Sommer T. Wolf D.H. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 12Werner E.D. Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13797-13801Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). This disposal process has been called ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Because the components of the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery are located in the cytosol, degradation of secretory and integral membrane proteins by this pathway requires that domains are, or become, accessible to the cytosol. Studies on the degradation of major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chains (13Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M., Yu, J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar), among other examples, have shown that multi-ubiquitinylated substrates accumulated in the cytosol when proteasome activity was inhibited, supporting a model in which complete retrotranslocation of these proteins from the ER to the cytosol occurs (14Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar). At least for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, as undegraded protein accumulated in the cytosol, large aggregates (“aggresomes”), irreversibly lost from the secretory pathway, formed and were visible by fluorescence microscopy (14Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar, 15Wigley W.C. Fabunmi R.P. Lee M.G. Marino C.R. Muallem S. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In contrast to these other ERAD substrates, we and others have recently shown that, in HepG2 cells, apoB destined for degradation does not accumulate in the cytosol when the proteasome is inhibited (16Zhou M. Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24649-24653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), but remains associated with the ER in close proximity to the translocon protein Sec61p (1Mitchell D.M.

Rather, only a subset of domains of the substrate may become exposed to and engaged by cytosolic components. This would be consistent with the localization in yeast of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc6p and Ubc7p to the cytosolic face of the ER membrane (11Sommer T. Wolf D.H.

The focus of this study is the relationship between apoB and the translational and translocational machinery under metabolic conditions favoring either lipoprotein assembly or proteasomal degradation. From a variety of approaches, we have obtained data to support a model in which apoB translation in HepG2 cells is not completed until lipoprotein assembly has concluded. If conditions are not favorable to assemble a lipoprotein, apoB polypeptides destined for degradation form a complex with the proteasome and the cytosolic chaperone hsp70, leading to degradation. Overall, then, for apoB in HepG2 cells, both lipoprotein assembly and ERAD appear to be co-translational rather than post-translational processes. HepG2 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 μm l-glutamine, and 200 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and were studied after achieving ∼80% confluency. In all but the immunofluorescence experiments, cells were pretreated for 60 min with 10 μm proteasomal inhibitor (lactacystin), which was then included in all subsequent labeling and chase media. In addition, unless otherwise noted under “Results,” all pulse-chase experiments were performed either with oleic acid (OA; to stimulate lipid synthesis and lipoprotein assembly) complexed to BSA (0.8 mm final concentration of OA in a 5:1 molar ratio with BSA) or with 0.16 mm BSA added to the chase medium. Rabbit antiserum against the 26 S proteasome and the fluorescent substrate for in vitro proteasome activity assay (benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Gly-Phe-p-aminobenzamide) were generous gifts from Drs. M. Orlowski and C. Cardozo (Department of Pharmacology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York). Rabbit antiserum to Sec61α was prepared by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) and used as described previously (21Do H. Falcone D. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 369-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Goat anti-human apoB antiserum and monoclonal antibody for immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence, respectively, and antisera to human apoA-I and calnexin were purchased from Calbiochem. Monoclonal antibody to hsp70 was purchased from Stressgen Biotech Corp. (Victoria, Canada). Antiserum to human α2-macroglobulin (α2M) was purchased from BIODESIGN International (Saco, ME). In some apoB immunoprecipitation experiments, we used epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies, Bsol 14 (specific for the N terminus) and Bsol 22 (specific for the C terminus), which were purchased from the Lipoprotein Research Facility of the Ottawa Heart Institute (Ottawa, Canada). Anti-puromycin antiserum was provided by one of us (W. J. W.) and is described in Ref. 22Eggers D.K. Welch W.J. Hansen W.J. Mol. Biol.

Isotope-containing medium was then removed, and the cells were incubated in chase medium (minimal essential medium containing 5 mm methionine and 2 mm cysteine) for 20 or 60 min. At the end of the chase period, cells were harvested in cross-linking buffer (1× PBS, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.4% (w/v) digitonin). The homobifunctional cross-linking agent DSP (Pierce) was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mm, and the cells were incubated on ice for 40 min. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by adding ice-cold Tris (pH 8) to a final concentration of 50 mm and incubating on ice for 15 min. Cells were then lysed in denaturing lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 5 mmEDTA, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS containing 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) with shaking overnight at 4 °C. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 3 min, and the supernatants containing equivalent trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts were then used for sequential immunoprecipitations. The sample was first exposed to antiserum against Sec61α as described (21Do H. Falcone D. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 369-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and the resulting immunocomplexes were captured by protein A-Sepharose and released from the beads by boiling in elution buffer (10% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 4% (w/v) SDS, and 20% (v/v) glycerol). The eluate was diluted in 1× NET, and the second immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-apoB antiserum as described previously (8Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20427-20434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The eluate from the second immunoprecipitation was analyzed by 3–17% gradient SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The signals were quantified using a densitometer (Bio-Rad GS 700) or a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Proteasome-inhibited HepG2 cells were incubated for 15 min in the presence of 35S-protein labeling mixture and chased in isotope-free chase medium. At 0, 20, 40, and 60 min, microsomes were prepared (see below) and lysed in denaturing lysis buffer, and equal volume aliquots were separately immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies Bsol 14 and Bsol 22 as described (8Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20427-20434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography as described above. In pilot experiments, labeled apoB from conditioned medium was similarly studied, and comparable recoveries were obtained with both antibodies. In some experiments, the topology of apoB was probed by treating microsomes with trypsin and recovering the remaining apoB with Bsol 14 or Bsol 22. Briefly, microsomes were resuspended in trypsin digestion buffer (25 mm KCl, 0.25 msucrose, 5 mm HEPES, and 5 mm EDTA), and trypsin was added to a final concentration of 75 μg/ml. The samples were incubated on ice for 45 min, and the reaction was arrested by adding 75 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and 1× protease inhibitor mixture. The samples were then divided and processed for denaturing immunoprecipitation with epitope-specific Bsol 14 and Bsol 22 antibodies. Under these conditions, there was quantitative cleavage of the cytosolic domain of the transmembrane ER protein calnexin and full protection of the ER luminal protein α2M (data not shown). Proteasome-inhibited HepG2 cells were incubated for 5 min in the presence of35S-protein labeling mixture and then incubated in chase medium. Puromycin (10 μm) was added to the medium either at the start of the chase period (0-min time point) or after 70 min. In either case, incubation was continued for an additional 5 min. ApoB and α2M (control protein) polypeptides that had incorporated puromycin were isolated by sequential immunoprecipitation using anti-apoB or anti-α2M antibodies, respectively, in the first step, followed by anti-puromycin antiserum (22Eggers D.K. Welch W.J. Hansen W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1559-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) in the second step. The proteins in the final immunoprecipitate were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by fluorography as described above. To verify the specificity of anti-puromycin antiserum, 100 μm puromycin was added to an aliquot of a control sample before incubation with anti-puromycin antiserum (see Fig. 3). Proteasome-inhibited HepG2 cells were incubated for 15 min in the presence of 35S-protein labeling mixture and chased for 0, 20, or 60 min. Cells were harvested in 1× PBS containing 0.4% (w/v) digitonin to semi-permeabilize the cells. Equal volume aliquots were treated with or without 1 mm puromycin and 0.5 m potassium acetate and then incubated on ice for 15 min and at 37 °C for 15 min to remove ribosomes from the ER membrane (23Gorlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 1500 ×g for 10 min and resuspended in DSP-containing buffer, and apoB cross-linked to Sec61α was isolated by sequential immunoprecipitation. Proteasome-inhibited HepG2 cells were incubated for 15 min in the presence of 35S-protein labeling mixture and chased for 20 or 60 min. At each time point, plates of cells were placed on ice and sequentially washed with ice-cold PBS, buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose and 5 mm EDTA, and SH buffer (0.25 m sucrose and 5 mm HEPES (pH 8.0)). Cells were scraped in SH buffer containing 1× protease inhibitor mixture and sonicated twice on ice at 50% duty cycle for 30 pulses using a Vibra CellTM sonicator (Sonics & Materials, Danbury, CT). The cell suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min to remove the nuclei and unbroken cells. Microsomes were separated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA 100.4 rotor. The pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 0.5 m sucrose and 5 mm HEPES (pH 8.0) and centrifuged again for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. Microsomal pellets were resuspended in nondenaturing lysis buffer (0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8)) overnight with rocking at 4 °C. The suspension was clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 1500 ×g. The supernatant containing the microsomal membranes was diluted in nondenaturing immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), and 5 mm EDTA) and incubated with anti-proteasome antiserum for 3 h with rocking at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes captured by protein A-Sepharose were eluted by boiling in buffer containing 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. To isolate proteasome-associated apoB, the eluates were diluted, and a second immunoprecipitation was performed using antiserum to apoB. The final immunoprecipitate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography as described above. Proteasome-inhibited HepG2 cells were labeled to steady state by incubation for 2 h in the presence of35S-protein labeling mixture. The cells were then permeabilized (4 °C for 15 min) with buffer containing 1× PBS, 0.4% (w/v) digitonin, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture with or without 50 units/ml apyrase (Sigma). Microsomal membranes were prepared as described above and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-hsp70 monoclonal antibody. One-half of the immunoprecipitate was used for Western blotting (Renaissance kit, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with anti-proteasome antiserum (to detect hsp70-proteasome interactions), and the other half was used for a second immunoprecipitation with anti-apoB antiserum (to detect hsp70-apoB interactions). The immunoprecipitate was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography as described above. HepG2 cells grown on collagen-coated coverslips were preincubated for 2 h with 10 μm lactacystin in minimal essential medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum. Cells were then washed, and the medium was replaced with one containing either 0.16 mm BSA or 0.8 mm OA (as a complex with BSA) to stimulate lipid synthesis. The cells were fixed 0, 30, or 90 min after OA addition using 3% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with anti-apoB antibody (primary antibody) and then with Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) as the secondary antibody as described (1Mitchell D.M. Zhou M. Pariyarath R. Wang H. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N. Fisher E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14733-14738Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In control experiments, the same protocol was performed using anti-human apoA-I antiserum as the source of primary antibody. We have previously reported that pulse-labeled apoB that is protected from degradation by proteasomal inhibitors stays associated with the ER translocon protein Sec61β for at least 1 h after the start of the chase period (1Mitchell D.M. Zhou M. Pariyarath R. Wang H. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N. Fisher E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14733-14738Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This prolonged association with Sec61β was disrupted after 40 min when triglyceride synthesis, and therefore lipoprotein assembly, was stimulated by including OA in the chase medium. Based on the time estimated for hepatic lipoprotein assembly and ER exit (∼37 min) (24Borchardt R.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16394-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this result suggested that throughout the biogenesis of an apoB-lipoprotein complex in the HepG2 cell, apoB remained in close proximity to the translocon. The interaction of translocating chains with Sec61α and Sec61β can vary depending on the length of the polypeptide or its transmembrane topology (e.g. Ref. 25Laird V. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1983-1989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, to test whether the previous results for Sec61β represented a special relationship of that protein with apoB or a more general association of apoB with the translocon, the pattern of interaction of pulse-labeled apoB with Sec61α was determined. HepG2 cells pretreated with lactacystin were incubated in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine for 15 min and chased for up to 60 min in isotope-free medium containing excess methionine/cysteine (chase medium). Cells were harvested at 0-, 20-, or 60-min time points, and apoB adjacent to Sec61α was detected by DSP-based cross-linking and sequential immunoprecipitation (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 1, similar to the published results for Sec61β (1Mitchell D.M. Zhou M. Pariyarath R. Wang H. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N. Fisher E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14733-14738Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), a substantial amount of Sec61α-associated apoB (∼23% of the total labeled apoB pool) (Fig.1 B) could be detected as late as the 60-min time point when OA was omitted from the chase medium. In the presence of OA, the fraction of apoB adjacent to Sec61α was significantly reduced at 60 min (Fig. 1 A, lane 5 versus lane 4). Note that the efficiency of chemical cross-linking of proteins with disuccinimide-based reagents typically averages no more than 10% (26Waugh S.M. DiBella E.E. Pilch P.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3448-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that the relatively robust results for the apoB-Sec61α interactions summarized in Fig. 1 are representative of the behavior of the bulk of apoB polypeptides studied under these conditions. To exclude the possibility that OA was affecting apoB-translocon interactions independent of its promotion of lipoprotein assembly, such as by disrupting the ER membrane, the above experiment was repeated in the presence of 0.1 μm BMS-200150, an inhibitor of MTP lipid transfer activity (kindly provided by Drs. David Gordon and John Wetterau, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.) (27Jamil H. Gordon D.A. Eustice D.C. Brooks C.M. Dickson Jr., J.K. Chen Y. Ricci B. Chu C.H. Harrity T.W. Ciosek Jr., C.P. Biller S.A. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11991-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). If the effect of OA were nonspecific, blocking MTP activity and lipoprotein assembly would not alter the interaction of apoB with the translocon. As shown in Fig. 1(lane 6), however, the decrease in apoB-Sec61α cross-linking at 60 min could be reversed by adding BMS-200150 to the medium in the presence of OA. Thus, the decreased proximity of apoB to Sec61α in the presence of OA most likely reflects successful lipoprotein assembly and exit from the ER, and not a nonspecific effect of the fatty acid on apoB-Sec61α association. The above and previous (1Mitchell D.M. Zhou M. Pariyarath R. Wang H. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N. Fisher E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14733-14738Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) results demonstrate that apoB remains adjacent to the translocon during lipoprotein assembly. We wondered whether the apoB bands in Fig. 1 included some incompletely translated apoB that was indistinguishable upon SDS-PAGE from bona fide full-length apoB100. If translation were incomplete, we would expect that in a pulse-chase study, the appearance of an epitope at the extreme C terminus should be abnormally delayed relative to one at the N terminus. Therefore, we compared the relative recoveries of the N- and C-terminal epitopes from microsomes isolated at different time points during the 60-min chase. As in the experiments above, proteasome-inhibited HepG2 cells were pulse-labeled; and after 0, 20, 40, and 60 min of chase, cells were harvested, and microsomes were collected by ultracentrifugation (see “Experimental Procedures”). Equivalent aliquots of the resuspended microsomal pellets were immunoprecipitated with Bsol 14 or Bsol 22 monoclonal antibodies, which recognize the N-terminal (amino acids 405–539) and C-terminal (amino acids 4521–4536) regions of apoB, respectively. The signals on the resulting fluorograms were quantified by densitometry, and the abundance of labeled apoB recovered by the anti-C terminus antibody was divided by the abundance recovered by the anti-N terminus antibody. This fraction was multiplied by 100 to derive the parameter we have termed the “C/N ratio.” The results are summarized in Fig.2 A. The C/N ratio was 100 for apoB in the conditioned medium (i.e. medium collected after 2 h of continuous labeling in the presence of OA), demonstrating equal recovery efficiencies of the antibodies when both epitopes were present on fully translated apoB. At the end of the 15-min labeling period (i.e. 0 min of chase), the C/N ratio was only 50, indicating that only 50% of the microsome-associated apoB molecules contained the C-terminal epitope. At 20 min of chase, there was still a relative deficiency of the C-terminal epitope. Based on the average elongation rate of hepatic proteins, apoB translation would be expected to be finished by ∼11 min. Therefore, the data indicate a greater than expected lag in the appearance of the C-terminal epitope, reflecting a delay in completing apoB translation. In the presence of OA, the C/N ratios at the 20- and 40-min time points were similar to those in Fig. 2 A, but were lower at 60 min, most likely representing the exit from the ER of full-length apoB molecules assembled into lipoproteins (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 A, some apo"

It is also shown that molecular oxygen competes considerably with the prenylquinones in cytochrome b559 oxidation under aerobic conditions, indicating that both molecular oxygen and plastoquinones could be electron acceptors from cytochrome b559 in PSII preparations. α-Tocopherol quinone was not active in the stimulation of cytochrome photoreduction but efficiently oxidized it in the dark. Both the observed photoreduction and dark oxidation of the cytochrome were not sensitive to 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1996: 249-264Google Scholar). It was found that it has a crucial role in PSII assembly, and its electron transport properties are attributed to protection of PSII against photoinhibition (1Stewart D.H. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 3Barber J. De Las Rivas J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is found in thylakoid membranes and in PSII preparations in high potential (HP) and low potential (LP) forms differing in redox potentials (Em = 330–400 and 20–80 mV, respectively) (2Whitmarsh J. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1996: 249-264Google Scholar), and both these forms are believed to be at least partially interconvertible (1Stewart D.H. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 4Whitmarsh J. Samson G. Poulson M. Baker N.R. Bowyer J.R. Photoinhibition of Photosynthesis.

In native, fully functional PSII complexes, the LP form is probably a minor component whose levels increase under photoinhibitory conditions. Under strong light illumination (acceptor side inhibition), the LP form of cyt b559 was found to accept electrons from the photoreduced pheophytin, preventing PSII from photoinhibition (3Barber J. De Las Rivas J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10942-10946Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 5Poulson M. Samson G. Whitmarsh J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10932-10938Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,7Nedbal L. Samson G. Whitmarsh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7929-7933Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the natural electron acceptor from the cyt b559 LP form is unknown. Among the potential candidates, plastoquinone and molecular oxygen have been suggested (4Whitmarsh J. Samson G. Poulson M. Baker N.R. Bowyer J.R. Photoinhibition of Photosynthesis. BIOS Scientific Publishers Ltd., Oxford1994: 75-93Google Scholar). The second possibility is supported by autoxidation of the LP form of cyt b559 (8Kruk J. Strzalka K. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 62: 273-279Crossref Google Scholar). Under the impairment of the oxygen-evolving complex, when electron donation from the oxygen-evolving complex to P680 is inhibited (donor side inhibition), the electrons from the HP form of cyt b559 are transferred to P680 via the redox active chlorophyll Z (Chlz) (1Stewart D.H. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was suggested (1Stewart D.H. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) that under such conditions the HP form is converted by an unknown molecular switch to the LP cyt b559 form, which after its autoxidation cannot donate electrons to P680. This state, in turn, causes oxidation of Chlz, which in a radical form efficiently quenches excitation energy, preventing RC from overexcitation (1Stewart D.H. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It is known that the electron transport via cyt b559 is relatively slow (1Stewart D.H. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and to fulfill its photoprotective function, it should be relatively fast. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate the factors accelerating reduction and oxidation of the cyt b559 LP form. It was found that in isolated reaction centers, where only the LP cyt b559 form is present (9Chapman D.J. Gounaris K. Barber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 423-431Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar), the photoreduction of cyt b559 was strongly stimulated by artificial quinones, such as DBMIB (10Satoh K. Hansson Ö. Mathis P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1016: 121-126Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or decyl-PQ (9Chapman D.J. Gounaris K. Barber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 423-431Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It was suggested that these quinones substitute for the QA site and mediate cytochrome reduction via the semiquinone form. However, it is not certain whether the interactive site of the quinones is in fact the QA site (11Nakane H. Iwaki M. Satoh K. Itoh S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1991; 32: 1165-1171Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of interest to investigate in more detail the specificity of cyt b559photoreduction by different natural and artificial quinones, to investigate whether the quinone-binding site(s) are different from the QA site, and to consider whether this quinone-mediated cytochrome reduction could take place in vivo. In the present study, we have performed measurements of the photoreduction and dark oxidation of the cyt b559 LP form in Triton X-100-solubilized PSII particles under the influence of different plastoquinone homologues in anaerobic and aerobic conditions. We have also included for these studies α-tocopherol quinone (α-TQ), a natural thylakoid prenylquinone of unknown function in plants (12Kruk J. Strzalka K. J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 145: 405-409Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) that is an effective quencher of PSII fluorescence (13Kruk J. Schmid G.H. Strzalka K. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 38: 271-277Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and also affects the cyclic electron flow around PSII (14Kruk J. Burda K. Radunz A. Strzalka K. Schmid G.H. Z. Naturforsch. 1997; 52: 766-774Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). PSII particles were isolated according to the method of Berthold et al. (15Berthold D.A. Babcock G.T. Yocum C.E. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 231-234Crossref Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). PQ-1-PQ-4 homologues were a kind gift of H. Koike, PQ-9 was a gift from Hoffmann-La Roche, PQ-decyl was from Sigma, and vitamin K3 (menadione) was from Aldrich. α-TQ was prepared from α-tocopherol as described by Kruk (16Kruk J. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 30: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Menadiol (K3H2, MD) was obtained by reduction of menadione with NaBH4 in methanol, and its concentration was determined using the millimolar extinction coefficient ε = 20.1 at 245 nm in ethanol. Plastoquinone concentrations were calculated using ε255 = 17.94 mmcm−1 (17Kruk J. Strzalka K. Leblanc R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1112: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in absolute ethanol. All measurements of cyt b559 redox changes on PSII particles were made in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 at a chlorophyll concentration of 50 μg/ml and in the presence of 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100. Additionally, photoreduction of cyt b559 was measured in the presence of 1 mm MnCl2 as an electron donor to PSII. The cyt b559 concentration was determined using Δε559–570 = 20 mmcm−1 (18Bendall D.S. Davenport H.E. Hill R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 23: 327-344Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, all kinetic measurements were performed under anaerobic conditions using an oxygen trap composed of glucose oxidase (50 units/ml = 1.5 mg/ml), catalase (500 units/ml = 23.8 μg/ml), and 1 mmglucose in a tightly closed cuvette at a volume of 2.5 ml. Both aerobic and anaerobic samples were incubated for 10 min before the measurements under continuous stirring. That time was sufficient for oxygen consumption by the oxygen trap and for the stabilization of the base line after Triton X-100 addition. The presence of 0.2% Triton X-100 had no influence on the efficiency of the oxygen trap when checked by the Clark oxygen electrode. The absorption spectra were measured in a split beam mode, and the kinetic measurements were made in a dual wavelength mode at 559–570 nm using an SLM Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer. The prenylquinones were added to the reaction mixtures as solutions in ethanol of which the final concentration did not exceed 1%. Photoreduction experiments were performed using light from a halogen projector passed through a 630-nm cutoff filter. To protect the photomultiplier from the scattered light, an interference filter (λmax = 564 nm,Tmax = 30%, full width at half-maximum = 12 nm) was placed in front of the photomultiplier. All the measurements were performed at room temperature. To observe only redox changes of the LP form of cyt b559 in PSII particles and to avoid possible absorption changes due to the HP form, we have performed our measurements in the presence of Triton X-100, which is known to convert the HP form into the LP form of cyt b559 (19Ortega J.M. Hervas M. Losada M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This detergent was also found to increase the ascorbate-reducible fraction of the cyt b559 as compared with the dithionite-reducible cyt b559 in PSII RC (20Gounaris K. Chapman D.J. Barber J. FEBS Lett. 1988; 240: 143-147Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), probably by disaggregation of the RC preparations, which in turn improves penetration of added redox compounds to the cytochrome. This detergent should also increase the solubility of the added hydrophobic prenylquinones. The difference absorption spectra in the α-band region of cyt b559 absorption show (Fig. 1) that our PSII preparation solubilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 does not contain any detectable cyt b559 HP redox form, whereas the ascorbate reduces the cytochrome to practically the same level as that produced by MD, which is a stronger reductant than ascorbate. Dithionite reduced the cytochrome to the same level as that produced by MD and ascorbate (data not shown), indicating that Triton X-100-solubilized PSII particles contain only the low-potential, totally ascorbate-reducible cyt b559 form. The presence of Triton X-100 also improves the optical properties of the sample. Because the Triton X-100 treatment inactivates the oxygen-evolving complex, 1 mmMnCl2 was added to all light-treated samples as an electron donor to PSII particles. Fig. 2 shows that under anaerobic conditions in the presence of even very low PQ-2 concentration (1.73 mol of PQ-2/mol of cyt b559), the cytochrome is photoreduced at a fast rate and oxidized back to the original level after turning off the light. The second illumination of the same sample gives both faster photoreduction and photooxidation rates. Interestingly, the same sample in the presence of ambient oxygen shows no detectable redox changes of the cytochrome. This might indicate that the cytochrome is oxidized so quickly by molecular oxygen that there is no detectable steady-state level of the reduced cytochrome. The control sample, with no added quinone, shows almost no redox changes of the cytochrome. PQ-9 was also active in catalyzing the photoreduction and subsequent dark oxidation of the cytochrome. However, much higher amounts of PQ-9 are required to obtain significant levels of the cytochrome photoreduction. Even though the photoreduction is considerably less sensitive to PQ-9 than to PQ-2 in our measurements, it is much more sensitive than in analogous experiments performed on PSII RCs (20Gounaris K. Chapman D.J. Barber J. FEBS Lett. 1988; 240: 143-147Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), where the cytochrome could be photoreduced to not more than 62% of the total cytochrome present in the preparation and where this saturation was reached at over 300 mol of PQ-9/mol of cyt b559. In our case, the reduction level of cyt b559 is 65 and 40% for 110 PQ-9 and 55 PQ-9 samples (Fig. 2), respectively. It is also evident for samples with low PQ-9 content (55 PQ-9 and 28 PQ-9) that there is a residual fast photoreduction and dark oxidation absorbance change that is still present in the control sample (with no added quinone) but is not observed under aerobic conditions. These cytochrome redox changes could originate from the residual plastoquinone present in PSII preparations or a low efficient electron transport via cyt b559 without the participation of the plastoquinone. In contrast to plastoquinones, α-TQ was not active in stimulation of the cytochrome photoreduction even at high concentrations (Fig. 2). None of the cytochrome redox changes shown in Fig. 2 was inhibited by DCMU, indicating that the QB site is not involved in the electron transport to and from cyt b559 under our conditions. Fig. 3 shows that the cytochrome photoreduction rate is proportional to the PQ-2 content and is already observed at very low (substoichiometric) amounts of PQ-2 in relation to cyt b559, indicating a very tight binding site of PQ-2 in the vicinity of the cytochrome. The cytochrome is totally reduced already at 7 molecules of PQ-2 per heme of the cytochrome within 20 s of the measurements (compare Figs. 1 and 3). The photoreduction of cyt b559 in the presence of 14 mol of PQ-2/mol of cyt b559 at different light intensities under anaerobic conditions is presented in Fig.4. It is evident that the photoreduction rate is proportional to the light intensity but is not saturated even at the highest light intensity applied. On the other hand, full reduction is already reached at 100 μmol/m2/s within the time of measurement. The time-dependent cyt b559 photoreduction in the presence of plastoquinones with the different side chain length and DBMIB at 1.73 mol of quinone/mol of cyt b559 under anaerobic conditions shows (Fig. 5) that with decreasing the side chain length of PQ the photoreduction rate increases. PQ-9 was not active in the photoreduction at this concentration. DBMIB, which was shown in some studies to catalyze the cyt b559 photoreduction (10Satoh K. Hansson Ö. Mathis P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1016: 121-126Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Nakane H. Iwaki M. Satoh K. Itoh S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1991; 32: 1165-1171Google Scholar, 21Telfer A. Barber J. Baker N.R. Bowyer J.R.

BIOS Scientific Publishers Ltd., Oxford1994: 25-49Google Scholar), was nearly inactive at the concentration applied in Fig. 5 but showed stimulation of the reaction at higher DBMIB/cyt b559proportions (data not shown). It was suggested that the unusually high potential of the cyt b559 HP form is caused by the localization of the cyt b559 heme ring within the very hydrophobic interior of the membrane and that the transformation of the HP form to the LP form is the result of heme exposure to the more polar surroundings (2Whitmarsh J. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1996: 249-264Google Scholar, 22Krishtalik L.I. Tae G.-S. Cherepanov D.A. Cramer W.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 184-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 5 confirm that the heme of the cytochrome LP form is localized in polar surroundings, because the photoreduction is catalyzed most efficiently by relatively polar, short chain plastoquinones.Figure 4Photoreduction of cyt b559 in the presence of 14 mol of PQ-2/mol of cyt b559 at different light intensities under anaerobic conditions.

Other conditions were as described in the legends to Fig. 1 and 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To analyze the possible oxidation routes of the photoreduced cyt b559 (Fig. 2), we used chemical reduction of the cytochrome with a small excess of MD and followed the cytochrome oxidation under molecular oxygen (in air-saturated buffer) and exogenously added prenylquinones. Addition of MD under anaerobic conditions results in fast dark reduction of the cytochrome, which remains reduced for minutes (Fig.6 A). If MD is added under aerobic conditions, after transient reduction, the cytochrome is gradually oxidized by molecular oxygen (Fig. 6 B). When the cytochrome is reduced under anaerobic conditions and H2O2 is added, which immediately releases molecular oxygen on contact with the catalase, which is a component of the oxygen trap, the cytochrome oxidation is observed (Fig. 6 C). The second H2O2 addition, which should give a 200 μm oxygen concentration in the reaction mixture, causes a higher cytochrome oxidation rate than that under aerobic conditions, where the oxygen concentration should be about 250 μm. The reason for this could be that under the conditions illustrated in Fig. 6 B there is an excess of MD left after the cytochrome reduction that slows down its autoxidation. In the case of the reaction illustrated in Fig. 6 C, the first H2O2 addition probably at least partially removes the MD excess. Fig. 7 illustrates PQ-2-induced dark cytochrome oxidation after its prereduction with MD. PQ-2 induces cytochrome oxidation at rates proportional to the quinone concentration, but under anaerobic conditions the extent of the cytochrome reduction decreases with increasing PQ-2 concentration (Table I). In the presence of oxygen, the cytochrome oxidation rate is considerably increased by the simultaneous cytochrome autoxidation. In this case, the cytochrome is completely oxidized. PQ-9 and α-TQ were also active in the oxidation of cyt b559 (Fig. 8), but the oxidation rates in the presence of PQ-9 and α-TQ are considerably lower than those caused by PQ-2. In contrast to PQ-2, the oxidation extent is considerably higher for PQ-9 and α-TQ (Table I). The oxidation rates under aerobic conditions are evidently higher, and the rates correspond approximately to the oxidation rates under anaerobic conditions increased by the cytochrome autoxidation rate (Table I). Comparing the oxidation rates during dark periods in the photoreduced samples (Fig. 2) and the rates obtained from Figs. 7 and 8, it can be seen that the rates for the dark cytochrome oxidation obtained from experiments on cyt b559 prereduced by MD would not be high enough to account for the observed cytochrome oxidation rates prereduced by light at the same quinone concentrations. The reason for this could be partially connected with the excess of MD that remains after the cytochrome reduction. This probably inhibits the oxidation of the cytochrome by the added quinones, which can be deduced from comparison of the observed rates of the cytochrome autoxidation by ambient oxygen and the oxygen released from H2O2 (Fig. 6, B and C). Nevertheless, the above experiments show that cyt b559 can be effectively oxidized by prenylquinones or molecular oxygen in our system. DCMU had no influence on the observed dark oxidation of the cyt b559.Table IDark oxidation rates of cyt b 559 LP form and its extent of oxidation in PSII, 0.2% Triton X-100 preparations in the presence of different prenylquinones (at given quinone/cyt b 559 molar ratios) under anaerobic or aerobic conditions (+ O 2)Samplecyt b559 LP oxidation ratecyt b559 LP oxidation extentnm/min%1.73 PQ-2 (L-D)340–500100110 PQ-9 (L-D)180–250100220 PQ-298030110 PQ-26204028 PQ-22005028 PQ-2 + O2360100220 PQ-99570110 PQ-94565 (n.s.)110 PQ-9 + O210010055 PQ-93060 (n.s.)220 α-TQ9565 (n.s.)220 α-TQ + O2170100control + O267100control + O2 (H2O2)18065L-D stands for the cyt b559 oxidation in the presence of plastoquinones after its photoreduction.

The observed effects described above of stimulation of cyt b559 photoreduction by different plastoquinones are similar to those observed with DBMIB, PQ-decyl, or PQ-9 on the isolated PSII reaction centers (9Chapman D.J. Gounaris K. Barber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 423-431Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 10Satoh K. Hansson Ö. Mathis P. Biochim. Biophys.

FEBS Lett. 1988; 240: 143-147Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but in our case the photoreduction proceeds with higher quinone sensitivity and to a higher cytochrome reduction extent. The efficient photoreduction of the cytochrome at very low PQ-2 concentrations (Fig. 3) suggests a very tight binding site close to the cytochrome heme. The question arises as to whether it is one of the known quinone-binding sites in PSII (QA or QB) or another high affinity quinone-binding site in PSII. The lack of DCMU sensitivity of the cytochrome redox changes and the fact that the QB site is detergent-sensitive (23Messinger J. Schröder W.P. Renger G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7658-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and easily damaged indicate that the binding site is not QB. Moreover, to efficiently reduce the cyt b559 LP form, quinone molecules must operate via the semiquinone form, similarly to QA, and it is known that the QB site operates via a two-electron gate. However, involvement of QA also seems unlikely. It has been suggested that in isolated reaction centers, where the QAand QB plastoquinone molecules are lost (21Telfer A. Barber J. Baker N.R. Bowyer J.R. Photoinhibition of Photosynthesis. BIOS Scientific Publishers Ltd., Oxford1994: 25-49Google Scholar, 24Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the added quinones substitute for the QA site (10Satoh K. Hansson Ö. Mathis P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1016: 121-126Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Nakane H. Iwaki M. Satoh K. Itoh S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1991; 32: 1165-1171Google Scholar, 20Gounaris K. Chapman D.J. Barber J. FEBS Lett. 1988; 240: 143-147Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, in our case this seems unlikely, because we used PSII membranes. It was shown that it is very difficult to remove or substitute the QA molecule in isolated PSII core preparations (25Diner B.A. De Vitry C. Popot J.-L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 934: 47-54Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It requires high (1%) Triton X-100 concentrations in the presence of phenanthroline and hours of incubation time (25Diner B.A. De Vitry C. Popot J.-L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 934: 47-54Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In our experiments the samples were incubated only with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min before the measurements. Moreover, we have found that the photoreduction changes were already observed within a shorter time but that the base-line stability and signal to noise ratio were poor in that case (data not shown). Interestingly, the QAreconstitution experiments in PQ-9-depleted PSII core preparations (26Ozawa S. Hoshida H. Toyoshima Y. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: from Light to Biosphere. 1. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1995: 535-538Google Scholar) showed that this site shows a high structural specificity, and only PQ-9 or UQ-10 efficiently substituted for QA function, in contrast to PQ-2, DBMIB, or other short chain quinones. A similar specificity, only for PQ-9 or UQ-9, was observed in PSII core complexes where QA was exchanged by 1% Triton X-100-phenanthroline incubation (25Diner B.A. De Vitry C. Popot J.-L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 934: 47-54Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). On the other hand, rather low structural quinone specificity is observed for cyt b559 quinone-catalyzed photoreduction (9Chapman D.J. Gounaris K. Barber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 423-431Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These data favor the view that the quinone-binding site active in cyt b559 LP photoreduction is different from the QA and QB sites. It is also evident that the QA site shows specificity for hydrophobic quinones (PQ-9, UQ-9 or UQ-10), whereas the cyt b559quinone-binding site shows preference for polar plastoquinones or other artificial quinones, which is connected with the exposure of the heme of the cyt b559 LP form to the polar surroundings. The question arises as to whether this cyt b559LP quinone-binding site is occupied and functional in vivoin the native PSII. Some indication may come from analyses of the PQ-9 content of PSII membranes and PSII core complexes. Such analyses usually give about three or more PQ-9 molecules per RC in PSII membranes (27Tabata K. Itoh S. Yamamoto Y. Okayama S. Nishimura M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1985; 26: 855-863Google Scholar, 28Patzlaff J.F. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7802-7811Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); two of these molecules are strongly bound (non-extractable by hexane) (27Tabata K. Itoh S. Yamamoto Y. Okayama S. Nishimura M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1985; 26: 855-863Google Scholar), and about two are tightly bound PQ-9 molecules for PSII core complexes (28Patzlaff J.F. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7802-7811Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 29Tang X.-S. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4594-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 30Omata T. Murata M. Satoh K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 765: 403-405Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In both preparations, one molecule is certainly the QA molecule, but the identity of the second PQ-9 in PSII core complexes is not certain (29Tang X.-S. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4594-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 30Omata T. Murata M. Satoh K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 765: 403-405Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Probably it is not a QB molecule, because this site is easily damaged by detergent treatment during the PSII core isolation procedure, and the QB molecule is lost (23Messinger J. Schröder W.P. Renger G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7658-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 28Patzlaff J.F. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7802-7811Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 29Tang X.-S.

This also would explain poor or no DCMU sensitivity of the electron transport in PSII core complexes (29Tang X.-S. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4594-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 30Omata T. Murata M. Satoh K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 765: 403-405Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It was originally thought that the additional, tightly bound PQ-9 molecule to PSII membranes is Z (27Tabata K. Itoh S. Yamamoto Y. Okayama S. Nishimura M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1985; 26: 855-863Google Scholar), the primary electron donor to P680, but it turned out that it was tyrosine. This data may suggest that the second, tightly bound PQ-9 molecule in PSII core complexes is the PQ-9 molecule participating in cyt b559 photoreduction via the semiquinone form and is different from the QA molecule. The site of quinone interaction with the cyt b559 causing its oxidation seems to be a low affinity quinone-binding site that is also DCMU-insensitive and is probably in contact and exchange with the PQ pool in thylakoid membranes. An argument supporting the concept of different photoreduction and dark oxidation sites of cyt b559 LP is the inefficiency of α-TQ in the stimulation of the cytochrome photoreduction; but at the same concentration α-TQ efficiently oxidizes the reduced cytochrome. The model of electron transport pathways in PSII showing the PQ-binding sites (QA and QB) together with the high (QC) and low (Q) affinity PQ-binding sites involved in cyt b559 redox changes is shown in Fig.9. The possible physiological role of the quinone-stimulated cyt b559 photoreduction (via the QC site) and its reoxidation (via the Q site) could be the acceleration of the electron transport from pheophytin to the PQ pool or to molecular oxygen via cyt b559 LP upon acceptor side inhibition (Fig. 9) when the electron route via QA→QB→PQ pool is saturated or inhibited and electron donation to P680 from the oxygen-evolving complex is active. When PSII is fully functional, electron transport via QA→QB dominates, and the cyt b559 exists mainly in the HP form, which is kept reduced by the plastoquinol of the PQ pool. Under donor side inhibition, P680 is reduced by the cyt b559 HP form via the redox active ChlZ molecule (1Stewart D.H. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Moreover, a β-carotene molecule probably mediates electron transfer between ChlZ and P680 (31Hanley J. Deligiannakis Y. Pascal A. Faller P. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8189-8195Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 32Gruszecki W.I. Strzalka K. Radunz A. Kruk J. Schmid G.H. Z. Naturforsch. 1995; 50: 61-68Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The hypothetical molecular switch transforms the HP to the LP form, which is further oxidized by molecular oxygen or a neighboring PQ molecule (Q in Fig. 9), and the oxidized LP form is no longer able to donate electrons to P680. Then, ChlZ is oxidized, giving ChlZ+, which effectively quenches the excitation energy, preventing the photosynthetic apparatus against overexcitation (1Stewart D.H. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The electron route via QC upon acceptor side inhibition also requires the HP→LP molecular switch to give a sufficient cyt b559 LP level through which electrons could outflow from pheophytin via QC and the cyt b559 LP form to O2 or PQ pool, preventing charge recombination in the RC, leading to P680 triplet state formation and consequently RC degradation (2Whitmarsh J.

Single-channel recording of L-type Ca2+ channel currents showed three distinct modes of Ca2+ channel gating: brief openings (mode 1), no openings due to channel unavailability (mode 0), and long-lasting openings and very brief closing (mode 2) (6Hess P. Lansman J.B. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1984; 311: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Bay K 86441 enhances Ca2+ channel current by promoting mode 2, whereas nitrendipine inhibits the current by favoring mode 0 (6Hess P. Lansman J.B. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1984; 311: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). However, the conformational change accompanied with channel gating and its modulation by Ca2+ channel agonists and antagonists is largely unknown. Determination of amino acids that are critical for the specific interaction with Ca2+ channel agonists and antagonists will help clarify the binding pockets and the molecular mechanism underlying modulation of Ca2+ channel gating. DHP-binding sites have been determined by photo-affinity labeling, radioligand binding, chimera, and alanine-scanning mutagenesis based on sequence differences between α1C (or α1S) and the DHP-insensitive α1A subunit (7Grabner M.

However, other amino acids conserved in both DHP-sensitive and DHP-insensitive α1 subunits may also participate in the binding pocket for DHPs. Indeed, alanine-scanning mutagenesis of IIIS6 and IVS6 showed that some amino acids conserved in both α1C and α1A are required for the high affinity binding of Ca2+ channel antagonists (12Peterson B.Z.

Recently, ascidian Ca2+ channel (TuCa1) was cloned (13Okamura Y. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: A340Google Scholar). TuCa1 belongs to the L-type Ca2+ channel and has all amino acids that have been determined as critical sites for DHP binding so far. However, Ba2+ currents through TuCa1 were poorly sensitive to the DHP antagonist, nitrendipine, and insensitive to the DHP agonist, S-(−)-Bay K 8644, when expressed in Xenopusoocytes. The jellyfish Ca2+ channel (CyCaα1) was also insensitive to DHPs (14Jeziorski M.C. Greenberg R.M. Clark K.S. Anderson A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22792-22799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These reports imply that amino acid residues conserved in DHP-sensitive and DHP-insensitive Ca2+ channel α1 subunits are also required for the high affinity binding pocket of DHPs. Thus, in the present study, we searched for amino acids, which are conserved in α1A, α1B, α1C, α1D, α1E, and α1S but not in TuCa1 or CyCaα1, to identify novel determinants of DHP binding (see Fig. 1). We identified Ser1115, located in the pore-forming region between IIIS5 and IIIS6 of the L-type Ca2+ channel α1C subunit, as a critical determinant of DHP binding and of the action of DHP agonists. Single mutations were generated by introducing TuCa1-type amino acids into rat brain α 1Csubunit (rbCII, Cav1.2c), which was kindly supplied by Dr. T. P. Snutch (15Snutch T.P. Tomlinson W.J. Leonard J.P. Gilbert M.M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 45-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Single point mutations, S1115A, and S1146A, were introduced into IIIS5-S6 linker by replacing thePstI (3384)-XmnI (3743) fragment of rbCII, and A1420S was introduced into IVS5-S6 linker by replacing thePvuII (4185)-XhoI (4607) fragment of rbCII using the QuikChange method (Qiagen). Polymerase chain reaction was performed (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, and 60 s at 74 °C, for 30 cycles) using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and verified by sequence analysis. All α1C mutants were inserted into the expression plasmid pcDNAIII. Mutated α1C subunits were transiently expressed in BHK6 cells that stably express rabbit β1aand α2/δ subunits (16Wakamori M. Yamazaki K. Matsunodaira H. Teramoto T. Tanaka I. Niidome T. Sawada K. Nishizawa Y. Sekiguchi N. Mori E. Mori Y. Imoto K. J. Biol.

Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 30 μg/ml streptomycin, 30 units/ml penicillin, and 600 μg/ml G418, was used for culture medium. Cells were plated on coverslips coated with 0.5% gelatin and transfected with pcDNAIII-α1C mutants together with GFP (pEGFPC2) using Superfect (Qiagen). Cells were used for electrophysiological experiments 24–48 h after transfection. The whole-cell L-type Ca2+ channel currents were recorded with Ca2+(2 mm) as a charge carrier in bath solution containing (in mm): 137 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl2 (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH) at room temperature. The resistance of the heat-polished microelectrodes ranged between 2 and 4 MΩ when filled with the internal solution composed of (in mm): 120 CsCl, 20 tetraethyl ammonium chloride, 14 EGTA, 5 MgATP, 5 disodium creatine phosphate, 0.2 GTP, 10 HEPES, 0.2 cAMP (pH 7.3, adjusted with CsOH). Whole-cell currents were measured using a patch/whole-cell clamp amplifier (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) or Axopatch 1D (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA) via an analog to digital converter (Digidata 1200, Axon Instruments, Inc.). Voltage-clamp protocols and data acquisitions were performed using pCLAMP6 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Transfected cells were identified by the expression of GFP. The percentage of cells expressing GFP was about 40–60%, and Ca2+ channels were expressed in about 60–80% of the GFP-expressing cells. Because the inactivation kinetics of Ca2+ channels are influenced by the current density, we used cells expressing Ca2+ channel current density between 10 and 100 pA/pF. Cell-attached single-channel recordings were performed with a high K+ bath solution to cancel membrane potential (in mm): 5 KCl, 112 potassium aspartate, 5 NaCl, 3 MgCl2, 1 Mg-ATP, 2 EGTA, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, adjusted with KOH) at room temperature. The resistance of the heat-polished microelectrodes was between 2 and 9 MΩ when filled with the internal solution composed of (in mm): 110 BaCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4, adjusted with tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide). Single-channel currents were measured using EPC9 (HEKA , Germany). Voltage-clamp protocols and data acquisitions were performed by use of PULSE software (HEKA, Germany). Analysis of data was performed using TAC version 3.0 (Bruxton Corp., Seattle, WA), Igor Pro software, and Patch Analyst Pro software (MT Corp.). Diltiazem (generous gift from Tanabe Seiyaku) and verapamil (purchased from Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) were dissolved in distilled water and stored at 4 °C as 1 mm stock solutions. Nitrendipine (purchased from Funakoshi Seiyaku, Tokyo, Japan), S-(−)-Bay K 8644 (purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. St. Louis, MO), R-(+)-Bay K 8644 (purchased from Sigma), Bay Y 5959 (generous gift from Bayer AG, Wuppertal, Germany), (+)-isradipine (generous gift from Sandoz AG, Basel, Switzerland), and FPL-64176 (purchased from Sigma) were dissolved in EtOH and stored at −20 °C as 3 mmstock solutions. Drugs were dissolved in the external solution and applied by either perfusion (at 4 ml/min) or via concentration-clamp apparatus (Vibraspec, Inc., Philadelphia, PA) in the whole-cell patch-clamp recording. The concentration-clamp apparatus allowed us to exchange the extracellular solution within 50 ms (17Adachi-Akahane S. Cleemann L. Morad M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 435-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In single-channel recording experiments, each drug was directly added to the bath solution to make up the final concentration. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed with the Student-Welch'st test for simple comparisons. Differences atp < 0.05 were considered to be significant. We replaced the amino acids in IIIS5-S6 linker and IVS5-S6 linker of rbCII, which were conserved in α1A, α1B, α1C, α1D, α1E, and α1S but not in TuCa1 or CyCaα1, by corresponding amino acids of TuCa1 (S1115A, S1146A, and A1420S (Fig. 1)). Mutant α1 subunits were expressed in BHK6 cells that stably express rabbit β1a and α2/δ subunits. Expression of these mutant Ca2+ channels in BHK6 cells were confirmed by checking its molecular mass by Western blotting (∼220 kDa, data not shown). First, we examined whether point mutations altered electrophysiological properties of L-type Ca2+ channels. Both activation and inactivation kinetics of Ca2+ channel currents of all mutants were almost identical to those of rbCII (data not shown). All of the mutant Ca2+ channels and rbCII were activated at the threshold voltage of around −40 mV and peaked at 0 mV, and theI-V curves of all channels coincided with each other (Fig. 2 A). The half-activation voltages (Vhalf) and slopes were as follows:Vhalf, slope: −15.9 ± 0.625 mV, −6.74 ± 0.381 (S1115A); −12.9 ± 0.577 mV, −7.54 ± 0.323 (S1146A); −13.2 ± 0.470 mV, −7.56 ± 0.263 (A1420S); −14.2 ± 0.484 mV, −6.65 ± 0.292 (rbCII), respectively (n = 8–14). Ca2+ channel current densities did not differ between mutated α1C subunits and rbCII (−60.8 ± 12.4 pA/pF (S1115A), −40.1 ± 8.4 pA/pF (S1146A), −57.3 ± 10.3 pA/pF (A1420S), −47.8 ± 6.9 pA/pF (rbCII),n = 8–14). There were no differences in steady-state inactivation curves (Vhalf in mV): −32.2 ± 1.01 (S1115A), −34.3 ± 0.970 (S1146A), −33.0 ± 0.800 (A1420S), −30.0 ± 0.810 (rbCII) (n = 6–12; Fig. 2 B, c). No differences were found in the restitution curves. Time constants estimated by fitting the curves to two-exponential equation were as follows (τfast and τslow in ms): (19.1 ± 5.6 and 157.2 ± 14.3 (S1115A), 14.5 ± 5.8 and 144.0 ± 17.2 (S1146A), 11.9 ± 4.1 and 127.1 ± 19.1 (A1420S), 12.8 ± 4.5 and 161.1 ± 17.2 (rbCII), respectively (n = 5–7, Fig. 2 C, c). Therefore, S1115A, S1146A, and A1420S showed electrophysiological properties identical to those of rbCII. First, we examined the effect of diltiazem. All mutants and rbCII were equivalently blocked by diltiazem (1 μm) at holding potentials of −70 and −50 mV without any differences in the voltage dependence of the block (Fig. 3, A and B). We also compared the block of Ca2+ channel currents by verapamil (1 μm, 10 μm). Ca2+channel currents of S1115A were blocked to the same degree as that of rbCII (Fig. 3, C and D). On the other hand, sensitivity of S1115A to DHP antagonists, such as nitrendipine, at a holding potential of −70 mV was significantly decreased compared with those of rbCII, S1146A, and A1420S (Fig. 4 B). When holding potential was changed to −50 from −70 mV, nitrendipine block of S1115A channel was enhanced but still significantly weaker than that of rbCII. The concentration-response curve for the nitrendipine block of Ca2+ channel currents was shifted to the right by 57.5-fold in S1115A (IC50 values: 7.8 × 10−7m (rbCII) versus 4.5 × 10−5m (S1115A), Fig. 4 C). The affinity for (+)-isradipine was also reduced by 24.1-fold (IC50 values at −60 mV: 3.7 × 10−7m (rbCII)versus 8.9 × 10−6m (S1115A), (n = 3), data not shown). In S1115A,R-(+)-Bay K 8644, a stereoisomer of Ca2+ channel agonist S-(−)-Bay K 8644 (18Bechem M. Hebisch S. Schramm M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1988; 9: 257-261Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Triggle D.J. Rampe D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 507-511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), again, produced significantly smaller block of Ca2+ channel currents than in rbCII (Fig. 4, D and E). Thus, S1115A was significantly less sensitive to DHP antagonists.Figure 4Voltage-dependent block of Ca2+ channel currents by nitrendipine (0.1 μm) and R-(+)-Bay K 8644 (1 μm).

However, S1115A was not enhanced at all. This result was against our expectation that S-(−)-Bay K 8644 would produce smaller enhancement of Ca2+ channel currents in S1115A than in rbCII as was the case with the Ca2+ channel block produced by R-(+)-Bay K 8644 (Fig. 5, A and B). Ca2+ channel currents of S1115A were rather slightly decreased by S-(−)-Bay K 8644 (1 μm) (98.6 ± 3.45% of control) to the same degree as time control (92.9 ± 2.15% of control at 90 s, data not shown). Another DHP Ca2+ channel agonist, Bay Y 5959 (20Bechem M. Goldmann S. Gross R. Hallermann S. Hebisch S. Hütter J. Rounding H.P. Schramm M. Stoltefuss J. Straub A. Life Sci. 1997; 60: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), also did not enhance the Ca2+ channel current of S1115A, but rather slightly decreased it in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5, C and D). These results demonstrate that S1115A is insensitive to DHP Ca2+ channel agonists. Thus we verified whether S1115A lacks the sensitivity to only DHP Ca2+ channel agonists or Ca2+ channel agonists generally. A benzoylpyrrole-type Ca2+ channel agonist, FPL-64176 binds to the Ca2+ channel at its binding site distinct from that of DHPs (21Rampe D. Lacerda A.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 259: 982-987PubMed Google Scholar, 22Zheng W. Rampe D. Triggle D, J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 734-741PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ channel currents of S1115A were slightly enhanced by FPL-64176 (1 μm), unlike the results with S-(−)-Bay K 8644 or Bay Y 5959. However, the enhancement of Ca2+ channel currents through S1115A were markedly smaller than that of rbCII (Fig. 5, Eand F). Because Ser1115 is located only three amino acids away from Glu1118, which is the determinant of Ca2+ selectivity of the α1C subunit, the sensitivity of S1115A for DHPs may be affected by charge carriers. Therefore, we tested whether the above results were affected when Ba2+ was used as a charge carrier in place of Ca2+, and we obtained the same results as observed with Ca2+, such as insensitivity to S-(−)-Bay K 8644 (data not shown). We replaced Ser1115 by other amino acid residues (Asp, Thr, and Val) to identify the functional group responsible for the action of Ca2+ channel agonists. Replacement by valine (S1115V) or aspartic acid (S1115D) abolished the effect of S-(−)-Bay K 8644 (1 μm). In contrast, in S1115T,S-(−)-Bay K 8644 produced slight but significant enhancement of Ca2+ channel currents (Fig. 6). The Ca2+ channel block produced by nitrendipine was also reduced in S1115T. The IC50 value of S1115T was 1.9 × 10−5m, which was higher than that of rbCII by a factor of 25 but lower than that of S1115A by 2.3-fold (Fig. 4 C). These results indicate that the hydroxyl group of Ser1115 forms part of the DHP binding pocket and plays a critical role in mediating the action of DHP Ca2+ channel agonists. Single Ca2+ channel activity was recorded in cell-attached patch-clamp mode. In the presence ofS-(−)-Bay K 8644 or FPL-64176, the number of open events was largely increased in rbCII (NPo: N (the number of channels in the patch pipette) * Po (open probability). 0.0099→0.138 by S-(−)-Bay K 8644, 0.0244→0.828 by FPL-64176), but only slightly modified in S1115A (0.0298→0.0538, 0.00731→0.0132, by S-(−)-Bay K 8644 and FPL-64176, respectively (Fig. 7 A)). Open-time histograms of rbCII and S1115A with and withoutS-(−)-Bay K 8644 are shown in Fig. 7 B. The mean open time of rbCII was also increased by S-(−)-Bay K 8644 in rbCII but unchanged in S1115A (mean open time in ms: 1.60 ± 1.93 → 3.26 ± 3.23, 2.07 ± 3.46 → 2.24 ± 3.36, respectively). These results indicate that prolongation of Ca2+ channel opening by Ca2+ channel agonists is mostly absent in S1115A. DHP Ca2+ channel antagonists bind to Ca2+ channels in the inactivated state with high affinity (23Bean B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6388-6392Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). It is possible that the affinity of Ca2+ channel antagonists for Ca2+ channels is influenced by their inactivation kinetics. However, we did not find any differences in the electrophysiological properties between rbCII and mutant α1C subunits, indicating that the mutation introduced into the α1C subunit did not affect the inactivation kinetics (Fig. 2). Therefore, any differences in the responsiveness to DHPs between rbCII and mutant Ca2+ channels should result from the conformational change of the DHP binding pocket or the gating moiety linked to the DHP-binding site. IC50 values of the Ca2+ channel block produced by nitrendipine was higher in S1115A by 57.5-fold than in rbCII. Another DHP Ca2+ channel antagonist, R-(+)-Bay K 8644, also produced significantly smaller block in S1115A than in rbCII (Fig. 4). The mutation in IIIS6 (Y1152A) has been shown to reduce the affinity of (+)-isradipine by 25-fold (12Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Hockerman G.H. Acheson M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18752-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the present study, the affinity of (+)-isradipine for S1115A was also lower than that of rbCII by 24-fold. These results indicate that the replacement of Ser1115 by Ala reduced the affinity for DHP antagonists. In contrast, the Ca2+ channel currents of S1115A were inhibited by diltiazem and verapamil in the same way as that of rbCII (Fig. 3). Therefore, Ser1115 in IIIS5-S6 linker appears to play a critical role in the binding pocket specific to DHPs. Unexpectedly, Ca2+ channel currents of S1115A were insensitive to DHP Ca2+ channel agonists and rather slightly decreased by S-(−)-Bay K 8644 (Fig. 5,A and B) in a way similar to that of time control (data not shown). R-(+)-Bay K 8644, a DHP Ca2+channel antagonist, and S-(−)-Bay K 8644, a DHP Ca2+ channel agonist, are enantiomers. However, effects of both chemical compounds were not linearly altered in S1115A: antagonistic effects of R-(+)-Bay K 8644 were reduced, but agonistic effects of S-(−)-Bay K 8644 were completely eliminated. Even higher concentration (3 μm) ofS-(−)-Bay K 8644, a concentration more than 300 times higher than EC50 value of S-(−)-Bay K 8644 (∼10 nm), did not enhance Ca2+ channel currents of S1115A (data not shown). Thus the impairment of the action of both stereoisomers of DHPs were not simply explained by a decrease of affinity. Therefore, Ser1115 appears to serve as an important site for agonistic action of DHP Ca2+ channel agonists. Indeed, Ca2+ channel currents of S1115A were also rather slightly inhibited by another DHP Ca2+ channel agonist, Bay Y 5959, regardless of concentration (Fig. 5, Cand D). In contrast, the benzoylpyrrole (non-DHP) Ca2+ channel agonist, FPL-64176, slightly enhanced Ca2+ channel currents of S1115A, but the effect was significantly smaller than that of rbCII (Fig. 5, E andF). Considering that the bindings of S-(−)-Bay K 8644 and FPL-64176 to the Ca2+ channel do not compete with each other, i.e. that the binding sites for both compounds are distinct, the two compounds may share the common site, such as Ser1115, for producing Ca2+ channel agonist effects. These results indicate that Ser1115 plays a critical role in the action of Ca2+ channel agonists. Binding of Ca2+ to the Ca2+ channel pore may contribute to stabilize high affinity DHP binding (5Striessnig J. Grabner M. Mitterdorfer J. Hering S. Sinnegger M.J. Glossmann H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 108-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 24Glossmann H. Striessnig J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 114: 1-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the direct interaction between the Ca2+-binding site of the Ca2+ channel pore with DHPs has not been shown. The critical role of Ser1115 in DHP binding strongly supports this idea, because Ser1115 is located at three amino acids away from the key Glu1118 of the channel pore (25Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8 A). In addition, our findings are consistent with the previous studies: 1) DHP agonists and antagonists gain access to their binding sites from the extracellular side of the channel, 2) the DHP-binding site resides 11–14 Å from the extracellular surface of the cell membrane (26Kass R.S.

Wang Z.Y. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The previous studies have identified 14 amino acids, indicated as gray circles in Fig. 8 A, as critical sites for DHP binding, which were basically determined by comparison between the sequences of the DHP-insensitive α1A subunit and the DHP-sensitive α1C(α1S) subunit. However, the alanine-scanning mutagenesis performed in the whole area of the transmembrane region IIIS6 and IVS6 showed that the DHP binding pocket includes amino acids conserved in both α1A and α1C subunits. For this reason, the amino acids highly conserved in both α1A and α1C subunits may also serve as critical sites for DHP binding. Our finding of Ser1115 in IIIS5-S6 linker as a novel determinant of DHP binding is the first step toward understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the conformational change of the pore region involved in the modulation of Ca2+ channel gating by DHPs. Involvement of other domains such as motifs IS5-S6 and IIS5-S6 are under investigation. The single-channel study clearly showed that, in S1115A, Ca2+ channel agonists (or DHP agonist) failed to prolong Ca2+ channel opening. However, unexpectedly, the open probability was slightly enhanced by S-(−)-Bay K 8644 (Fig. 7 A), although the whole-cell Ca2+ channel current of S1115A was not increased at all (Fig. 5 A). These somewhat contradictory results may be explained as follows: 1) in whole-cell recording, natural run-down of the Ca2+ channel current may have masked the slight enhancement of S1115A byS-(−)-Bay K 8644 and resulted in the slight decrease of the current, because S-(−)-Bay K 8644 reduced the Ca2+ channel current to a degree similar to that of time control; 2) the difference of charge carrier (Ca2+ and Ba2+) may influence the effects of S-(−)-Bay K 8644, because Ser1115 is located near a Ca2+-selective filter (Glu1118). However, the latter possibility is unlikely, because effects ofS-(−)-Bay K 8644 on whole-cell Ca2+ channel currents were the same in rbCII and S1115A whether the charge carrier was Ca2+ (2 mm) or Ba2+ (2 mm) (data not shown). We replaced Ser1115 by other amino acid residues (Asp, Thr, Val) to identify the important functional group of this serine. Only S1115T was slightly increased byS-(−)-Bay K 8644. The binding affinity of S1115T for DHP antagonist was significantly lower than that of rbCII but higher than that of S1115A. These results indicate that the hydroxyl group at Ser1115 is important for DHP binding and the action of Ca2+ channel agonists. The steric hindrance by the methyl group at β-carbon of threonine may be the reason why effects of DHPs were significantly reduced in S1115T. The conformational dynamics of IIIS5-S6 linker and its role in the gating mechanism have not been clarified yet. When Gln1043in IIIS5 (10Mitterdorfer J. Wang Z. Sinnegger M.J. Hering S. Striessnig J.

Therefore, these two amino acids may be responsible for the conformational change of IIIS5-S6 caused by DHP Ca2+ agonists. Based on our finding that Ser1115 contributes to DHP binding and plays a critical role in producing the action of Ca2+ channel agonists, Ser1115 may be involved, in cooperation with Gln1043 and Met1161, in the conformational change of IIIS5-S6 linker upon binding of DHP Ca2+ channel agonists. Considering that electrophysiological properties of S1115A were identical to those of rbCII, Ser1115 appears to be a critical amino acid that links the binding of DHP agonists and the modulation of Ca2+ channel gating, which is not a result of modulation of Ca2+ channel activation (36Tanabe T.

Our finding further implies that the conformational change of IIIS5-S6 linker may be a critical step of Ca2+ channel gating and its modulation by Ca2+ channel antagonists or agonists. Therefore, we propose a model that DHPs interact with the hydroxyl group of Ser1115, and, especially upon the binding of Ca2+ channel agonists, such interaction stabilizes the Ca2+ channel in the open state (Fig. 8 B). We identified a novel critical site (Ser1115 in the IIIS5-S6 loop of the L-type Ca2+ channel α1C subunit) for DHP binding. Ser1115 turned out to be a critical determinant of action of DHP agonists.

We previously reported that selected cysteine substitutions within the carboxyl-terminal domain of the pore region of mouse αENaC (αSer580–αSer592) altered the cation selectivity and amiloride sensitivity of the channel and proposed that this region forms the selectivity filter of the channel (14Sheng S.

In the current study, we systematically examined accessibility of sulfhydryl reagents to αβγmENaCs with engineered cysteine within the 24-residue pore region of the α-subunit. Channels with selected cysteine mutations within the carboxyl-terminal portion of the pore region responded to the external application of MTS derivatives with an inhibition of amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents. In contrast, we observed a significant increase in amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents following the external application of MTS derivatives or Cd2+ when cysteine residues were introduced at selected sites within the amino-terminal portion of the pore region of αmENaC. The pattern of distribution of cysteine mutations that led to MTS-induced activation of Na+ currents suggests that this region has an α-helical structure. In addition, the activation of αS580Cβγ by an MTS reagent was associated with a dramatic increase in channel open probability. We propose that the ENaC pore region forms part of the outer pore vestibule with an α-helix followed by an extended region. ENaC may have limited structural similarities with the KcsA K+ channel (16Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

In addition, our results suggest that the pore region has a role in ENaC gating. All chemicals were from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on mouse αENaC (18Ahn Y.J. Brooker D.R. Kosari F. Harte B.J. Li J. Mackler S.A. Kleyman T.R. Am. J.

Amino acids αVal569–αSer592 of αmENaC were replaced individually with a cysteine residue, and target mutations were conformed by automated DNA sequencing, as described previously (14Sheng S. Li J.

Complementary RNAs (cRNAs) for wild type and mutant α-, wild type β-, and γmENaC were synthesized with T3 RNA polymerase (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Stage V–VI Xenopusoocyte was injected with 2–4 ng of cRNA for each subunit in 50 nl of H2O. Injected oocytes were maintained at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (MBS, 88 mm NaCl, 1 mmKCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm HEPES, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mmMgSO4, 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, pH 7.2). Two-electrode voltage clamp was performed 20–72 h after injection at room temperature (22–25 °C) as described previously (14Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Data acquisition and analyses were performed using pClamp 6.03 software (Axon Instruments) on a Pentium PC. Oocytes were maintained in a recording chamber with 1 ml of bath solution containing (in mm) 100 sodium gluconate, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 5 BaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2, and continuously perfused at the flow rate of 4–5 ml/min. Pipettes filled with 3 m KCl had resistances of 0.5–5 MΩ. Typically, oocytes were clamped to a series of voltage steps from −140 to +40 mV in 20-mV increments for 450 ms every 2 s, and the whole cell currents were measured at 400 ms. Amiloride-sensitive Na+currents were defined as the difference of Na+ currents in the absence and presence of 100 μm amiloride in the bath solution. The susceptibility of mutant channel with engineered sulfhydryl groups to sulfhydryl reagents was examined with the sulfhydryl reagents (2-aminoethyl) methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA), [(2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl] methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET), sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate (MTSES), and Cd2+. MTSEA (2.5 mm), MTSET (1 mm), and MTSES (5 mm) were prepared in bath solution immediately prior to use. Base-line Na+ currents and Na+currents at 1–3 min following perfusion of the oocytes with a reagent were measured. Oocytes were then washed with bath solution for 3 min, and the currents were monitored for observing the reversibility of the response to the reagent. Bath solution containing 100 μmamiloride was then applied to the oocyte to determine the amiloride-insensitive current. Responses are expressed as ratios of amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents after and before addition of the reagent (I/I0). Patch clamp was performed in cell-attached mode as described previously (14Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Bath and pipette solutions were identical and contained (in mm) 110 LiCl or NaCl, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with LiOH or NaOH, respectively. Na+ or Li+ currents were recorded at −100 mV (membrane potential). To test the effects of MTS on single channel properties of αS580Cβγ mENaC, 10 mmMTSET prepared in Na+ bath solution was added into the bath solution giving a 1 mm final concentration of MTSET, and currents were recorded within 1 h. Event files were generated from long current traces (>5 min) using Fetchan 6.05 (Axon Instruments), and open probability was estimated with Histogen 6.05 (Axon Instruments). Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used for significance analysis between wild type and mutant channel using MS Excel 97 (Microsoft, Inc.). ENaC pore regions are highly conserved among members of the ENaC/degenerin family (Fig. 1 A). Secondary structure predictions of the pore region suggest that the amino-terminal portion may exist as either α-helix or β-sheet, whereas the carboxyl-terminal portion appears to be more irregular in structure. The center portion is predicted to be a turn region (Fig.1 B). To probe the pore region structure, all residues within the αmENaC pore region (αVal569—Ser592) were systematically mutated to cysteine and coexpressed with WT β- and γmENaC subunits in Xenopus oocytes. We previously observed that all mutants with cysteine substitutions within the pore region of αmENaC retained channel activity, although low levels of expressed currents (<200 nA) were observed with two mutants (αG587Cβγ and αS589Cβγ) (14Sheng S.

Wild type αβγmENaC responded to 2.5 mm MTSEA with a partial inhibition of whole cell Na+ currents (I/I0 = 0.75 ± 0.05, n = 17; Fig.2 A). This reduction in current is similar to that reported by other investigators (5Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol.

The partial inhibition of wild type ENaC by MTSEA is likely due to covalent modification of Cys547 in γmENaC that aligns to Ser588 in αmENaC, as proposed by Snyder et al. (15Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Bucher D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28484-28490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Mutation of γCys547 to serine largely eliminated the MTSEA-induced partial inhibition of Na+ currents, whereas mutation of an adjacent cysteine (γC551S) had no effect on the partial inhibition of Na+ currents by MTSEA (data not show). Amiloride-sensitive whole cell Na+ currents in oocytes expressing wild type αβγmENaC were not significantly altered following addition of 1 mm MTSET or 5 mm MTSES to the bath solution (Figs. 2 A and4 A).Figure 4Effects of external MTSES (5 mm) on wild-type and mutant mENaCs.

Within the carboxyl-terminal portion of the pore region of αmENaC, only 1 of 8 mutants examined (αS583Cβγ) responded to both MTSEA (I/I0 = 0.04 ± 0.01, n = 4) and MTSET (I/I0 = 0.31 ± 0.09, n = 4) with a large inhibition of the amiloride-sensitive inward Na+current (Fig. 2 A and Fig. 3, B and C). Several mutants (αS588C, αV590C, and αL591C) responded to MTSEA with an inhibition of the amiloride-sensitive inward Na+current that was significantly greater than WT. These residues are located in close proximity to and on either side of a three-residue tract (αGly587–αSer589) that has a critical role in restricting K+ permeation through the channel (11Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Schild L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4170-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 12Kellenberger S. Hoffmann-Pochon N. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Schild L. J.

One mutant (αS588C) that responded to MTSEA with a partial inhibition of whole cell Na+ current is located within this three-residue tract. The MTSEA- and MTSET-induced inhibition of whole cell Na+ currents remained after these reagents were removed from the bath solution (Fig.3 C). In contrast, channels with cysteine substitutions at multiple sites within the amino-terminal portion of the pore region of αmENaC responded to MTSEA (i.e. αV572C, αS576C, αS580C, αQ581C, and αW582C) or MTSET (i.e. αV572C, αS576C, αN577C, and αS580C) with a significant increase in amiloride-sensitive inward Na+ currents (Fig.2 A). Only one mutant (αS573Cβγ) responded to MTSET with an inhibition of whole cell Na+ current (I/I0 = 0.64 ± 0.03, n = 5). The residues within the amino-terminal portion of the pore region where cysteine substitutions responded to MTS reagents with a large change in whole cell Na+ current line one face of an α-helix, with the exception of αW582C (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that this region is α-helical in structure. These increases in whole cell currents occurred rapidly (within a minute) after application of MTS reagents and were not reversible after MTSEA or MTSET were removed from the bath solution (Fig.3 C), indicating that the introduced cysteine residues were irreversibly modified. The inward Na+ currents following stimulation or inhibition by MTSEA or MTSET were completely inhibited by 100 μm amiloride (Fig. 3 C). These data suggest that MTS modification of the αmENaC pore residues did not interfere with the blocking effect of 100 μm amiloride, although it has been proposed that amiloride blocked ENaC by binding to a site formed by αSer583, βGly525, and γGly542 (10Schild L.

MTSEA and MTSET introduce positively charged groups to targeted cysteine residues. We tested whether the charges carried by MTS reagents were related to the stimulatory or inhibitory effects on mutant channels by examining the effects of a negatively charged reagent MTSES (5 mm) on αS576Cβγ, αS580Cβγ, and αS583Cβγ. αS576Cβγ responded to MTSES with a modest increase in whole cell Na+ current (I/I0 = 1.21 ± 0.04, n = 4), and αS580Cβγ responded to MTSES with a large increase in whole cell Na+ current (I/I0 = 3.3 ± 0.1, n = 6, Fig.4 A). In contrast, whole cell currents in oocytes expressing αS583Cβγ were unchanged in response to MTSES. When oocytes expressing αS583Cβγ were pretreated with MTSES, subsequent treatment with MTSEA still greatly inhibited whole cell Na+currents (I/I0 = 0.25 ± 0.04, n = 4), suggesting that αS583C was still accessible to MTSEA. When either αS576Cβγ or αS580Cβγ was pretreated with MTSES, the subsequent increase in whole cell Na+ current in response to MTSEA was significantly less than that observed without MTSES pretreatment (Fig. 4 B). These data suggest that MTSES reacted efficiently with both αS576Cβγ and αS580Cβγ but that αS583C was largely unmodified by MTSES. Snyder et al. (15Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Bucher D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28484-28490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) also observed that human ENaC with a cysteine substitution at the site analogous to αSer583(i.e. γG536C) was modified by MTSET but not by MTSES. Group IIB divalent cations such as Cd2+ and Zn2+ are able to bind free sulfhydryls with high affinity and therefore have been used as biophysical probes to study the pore structure of ion channels (19Chiamvimonvat N.

Cd2+ was used in this study as its crystal radius (0.92 Å) (21Tsushima R.G. Li R.A. Backx P.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) is nearly same as that of Na+(0.95 Å) (23Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 276Google Scholar). We examined whether extracellular Cd2+ (5 mm) altered whole cell Na+ currents in oocytes expressing either WT or mutant mENaCs. A modest increase in amiloride-sensitive whole cell Na+ current was observed in response to Cd2+ in oocytes expressing WT αβγmENaC. A similar response to extracellular Cd2+ was observed with 16 of the 22 mENaC mutants examined. Several mutations within the αmENaC pore region responded to Cd2+ with a significant increase (αN577C, αS580C, and αW582C) or a modest decrease (αG579C and αL584C) in whole cell Na+ current. Similar to MTSEA, Cd2+ abolished whole cell amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents in oocytes expressing αS583Cβγ (I/I0 = 0.03 ± 0.01, n = 4, Fig.2 A). The blocking effect of Cd2+ on αS583Cβγ was both fast and voltage-dependent, as evidenced by the minimal block of outward currents, compared with the large inhibition of inward currents (Fig. 3 B, right panel). This is consistent with the observation of voltage-dependent block of rat αS583Cβγ ENaC by external Zn2+ (10Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The introduction of cysteine residues at αVal572, αSer576, αAsn577, αSer580, αGln581, or αTrp582 led to channels that responded to MTSEA, MTSET, MTSES, or Cd2+ with an increase in whole cell Na+ current. These increases in whole cell currents occurred rapidly (within a minute) after external application of the MTS reagent or Cd2+ (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that changes in single channel Na+ conductance or open probability occurred. Previous studies demonstrated that the introduction of residues with large side chains at the site analogous to αSer576 of mENaC led to a significant increase of currents in oocytes expressing ASIC2 (or BNC1), an ENaC-related H+-gated ion channel (24Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30204-30207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Similar mutations of deg-1 or mec-4 (mechanosensitive proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans) led to neuronal degeneration (25Garcia-Anoveros J. Ma C. Chalfie M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 441-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,26Hong K. Driscoll M. Nature. 1994; 367: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We examined whether the introduction of a residue with a large side chain at or in proximity to αSer576 increased whole cell Na+ currents. Whole cell Na+ currents in oocytes expressing either αV572Fβγ or αS576Cβγ were significantly greater than that observed in oocytes expressing WT ENaC, although Na+ currents measured in oocytes expressing αV572Cβγ or αS576Fβγ were similar in magnitude to WT. In contrast, whole cell currents measured in oocytes expressing αS580Fβγ or αS580Cβγ were significantly less than that observed in oocytes expressing WT ENaC (Fig.5). We performed single channel analyses of αS580Cβγ before and after treatment with MTSET, to test whether the modification of the introduced cysteine residue altered channel gating (Fig.6). The single channel slope conductance for Na+ of αS580Cβγ was 3.7 ± 0.3 pS (n = 11), slightly less than the conductance of wild type mENaC (4.3 pS) (14Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our previous observation that the single channel slope conductance for Li+ of αS580Cβγ was nearly identical to WT ENaC and that the Li+/Na+ current ratio for αS580Cβγ was 1.36-fold greater than that of WT (14Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The open probability of αS580Cβγ was 0.07 ± 0.02 (n= 5), determined at potentials between −100 and −60 mV. The reduced single channel Na+ conductance and open probability were consistent with the reduced whole cell Na+ currents observed in oocytes expressing αS580Cβγ, when compared with oocytes expressing WT ENaC (Fig. 5). Following treatment with MTSET, αS580Cβγ exhibited a dramatic change in gating characteristics. When patches were made shortly (within minutes) following MTSET treatment, channels were primarily open but exhibited frequent transitions to the closed state (Fig. 6 B). However, when patches were made minutes later following MTSET treatment, channels remained open, and very few brief closures were observed (Fig. 6,C and D). The open probability was not determined due to too few transitions between open and closed states despite long (>10 min) recordings; however, open probability was clearly >0.9 (Fig. 6, C and D). The single channel conductance of MTSET-modified αS580Cβγ was 2.3 ± 0.1 pS (n = 4), lower than that of unmodified channels (equaling a 38% decrease). In many recordings we only observed noise, comparable to open channel noise, with no clear transitions suggesting that the channel remained open over a recording period of 5–10 min (data not shown). These data indicate that MTSET converted αS580Cβγ to a lower conductance channel, but one that was nearly continuously open. These MTSET-induced changes in conductance and open probability are the likely mechanisms of the MTSET-induced increase in whole cell Na+ current observed with this mutant channel (Figs. 2 A and 3 A). Similar single channel analyses were performed with Li+ as the conducting ion in the pipette, as well as in the bath solution. We observed that MTSET treatment of oocytes expressing αS580Cβγ reduced the unitary Li+ current from 0.7 to 0.3 pA at −80 mV and locked the channel in an open state as only brief closures were observed (Fig. 6 F). The Li+ current reduction in response to MTSET was larger than Na+ current reduction following MTSET treatment. These data obtained from single channel analyses with Li+ as the conducting ion were consistent with the effect of MTSET on amiloride-sensitive whole cell Li+ currents measured in oocytes expressing αS580Cβγ. Unlike the effects of MTSET on whole cell αS580Cβγ Na+ currents, Li+ currents were not significantly increased by MTSET (I/I0 = 0.93 ± 0.06,n = 4). It is likely that the MTSET-induced reduction in Li+ unitary current balances the MTSET-induced increase in αS580Cβγ open probability. The substituted cysteine accessibility method has been used to probe pore structure of various ion channels (27Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). In this study, we used this approach to examine the pore structure of αENaC. Several distinct effects of MTS reagents and Cd2+ on αβγmENaCs were observed with cysteine substitutions within the pore region of the α-subunit. MTSEA, MTSET, and Cd2+inhibited whole cell Na+ currents in oocytes expressing αS583Cβγ, as previously reported (4Kosari F. Sheng S. Li J. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13469-13474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 10Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, this is the only mutant that displayed significant block by these three reagents. The lack of an inhibitory effect of MTS reagents on engineered cysteines near αSer583 indicates that this residue is located within a restricted site. Interestingl"
https://openalex.org/W2063088152,"The vasorelaxant and anti-mitogenic activities of the atrial and brain natriuretic peptides depend upon their binding to the type A natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR-A) expressed on the surface of vascular cells. Intervention strategies aimed at controlling NPR-A expression are limited by the paucity of studies in this area. Here we identify a sequence CCAAT between −141 and −137 of the NPR-A promoter that, when mutated, reduces promoter activity by 90% in rat aortic smooth muscle (RASM) cells. Protein/DNA cross-linking and immunoperturbation of electrophoretically shifted complexes formed between RASM nuclear extracts and an oligonucleotide surrounding the CCAAT sequence indicates that the heterotrimeric transcription factor NF-Y binds specifically to the wild-type, but not mutated, CCAAT element. Cotransfection of a dominant negative mutant of the NF-YA subunit results in a concentration-dependent decrease in the activity of the NPR-A promoter in RASM cells confirming that endogenous NF-Y is an activator of the promoter. Mutation of the CCAAT element, in conjunction with mutation of all three Sp1 sites previously shown to be involved in NPR-A promoter regulation, virtually eliminates NPR-A promoter activity in RASM cells. Coexpression of all three NF-Y subunits together with Sp1 in <i>Drosophila</i> cells deficient in these factors indicates that NF-Y and Sp1 act synergistically to reconstitute NPR-A promoter activity. A direct physical association between NF-Y and Sp1 can be demonstrated both <i>in vitro</i> by glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase pull-down assay and in the intact cell by coimmunoprecipitation and functional studies. Together, these studies show that NPR-A promoter activity is dominantly regulated through functional, and possibly physical, interactions of NF-Y and Sp1."
https://openalex.org/W1999250281,"Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are potential targets for a wide variety of general anesthetics. We recently showed that α4β2 nAChRs are more sensitive than α4β4 receptors to the gaseous anesthetics nitrous oxide and xenon. The present study examines chimeric and point mutant rat nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes and identifies a single amino acid residue (β2-Val253 or β4-Phe255) near the middle of the second transmembrane segment (TM2) that determines gaseous anesthetic sensitivity. Mutations of this residue in β subunits and the homologous residue of α4 subunits (α4-Val254) showed that this position also determines sensitivities of nAChRs to acetylcholine, isoflurane, pentobarbital, and hexanol. In contrast, these mutations did not affect actions of ketamine. The positively charged sulfhydryl-specific reagent methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium reacted with a cysteine introduced at α4-Val254 or β2-Val253, and irreversibly reduced anesthetic sensitivities of nAChRs. Propyl methanethiosulfonate is an anesthetic analog that covalently binds to a TM2 site of γ-aminobutyric acidA and glycine receptors and irreversibly enhances receptor function. However, propyl methanethiosulfonate reversibly inhibited cysteine-substitution mutants at α4-Val254 or β2-Val253 of nAChRs, and did not affect anesthetic sensitivity. Thus, residues α4-Val254 and β2-Val253 alter channel gating and determine anesthetic sensitivity of nAChRs, but are not likely to be anesthetic-binding sites.

Lieb W.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar, 2Krasowski M.D. Harrison N.L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1278-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Among them, GABAA and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are particularly sensitive to a wide variety of general anesthetics. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) of skeletal muscle and fish electric organ are composed of the α1, β1, δ, and γ or ε subunits. For neuronal nAChRs, 11 subunits (α2–9, β2–4) are identified and they provide physiological and pharmacological heterogeneity distinct from muscle nAChRs (3Sargent P.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 4Gotti C. Fornasari D. Clementi F. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 53: 199-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Although a predominant co-distribution of the α4 and β2 subunits in the central nervous system and the α3 and β4 subunits in the peripheral nervous system has been reported (3Sargent P.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 5Role L.W. Berg D.K. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1077-1085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), more recent studies have shown that there might be a greater variety of subunits throughout different regions of the brain (4Gotti C. Fornasari D. Clementi F. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 53: 199-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 6Zoli M. Lena C. Picciotto M.R. Changeux J.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4461-4472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sensitivity of nAChRs to some anesthetics are different between homologous nAChR subunits. Neuronal heteromeric nAChRs, especially those composed of β2 subunits are very sensitive to volatile anesthetics, whereas homomeric α7 and muscle nAChRs are relatively insensitive to volatile anesthetics (7Violet J.M. Downie D.L. Nakisa R.C. Lieb W.R. Franks N.P. Anesthesiology. 1997; 86: 866-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 8Flood P. Ramirez-Latorre J. Role L.

Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Sensitivity of neuronal nAChRs to dissociative anesthetics ketamine and dizocilpine is dependent on subunit composition with β subunits being more critical than α subunits (10Yamakura T. Chavez-Noriega L.E. Harris R.A. Anesthesiology. 2000; 92: 1144-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The α4β2, but not α4β4, nAChRs are sensitive to clinical concentrations of gaseous anesthetics nitrous oxide and xenon (11Yamakura T. Harris R.A. Anesthesiology. 2000; 98: 1095-1101Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar). To identify the critical site determining sensitivity of nAChRs to gaseous and other general anesthetics, we constructed chimeric and single amino acid mutants of nAChR subunits between β2and β4 subunits, and examined their anesthetic sensitivities. This strategy was shown to be successful in studies of agonist selectivity and substance P and cocaine modulation of nAChRs (12Figl A. Cohen B.N. Quick M.W. Davidson N. Lester H.A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 13Stafford G.A. Oswald R.E. Figl A. Cohen B.N. Weiland G.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Furthermore, we explored whether the critical site is an anesthetic-binding site, by a new approach using an alkanethiol anesthetic or a sulfhydryl-specific reagent that form disulfide bonds with thiol group of a cysteine residue introduced at the site, which was recently employed for GABAA and glycine receptors (15Mascia M.P. Trudell J.R. Harris R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9305-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The rat nAChR subunit cDNAs in several expression vectors, α2 and β2 in pSP65 vector (pSP65α2 and pSP65β2, respectively), α3 and α4 in pSP64 vector (pSP64α3 and pSP64α4, respectively), and β4 in pBluescript SK− vector (pBSKβ4) were provided by Dr. Charles W. Luetje (University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL). To create a SpeI restriction enzyme site, silent mutations were introduced into pSP65β2 at amino acid residues position 224–225 (numbering of the mature β2subunit protein (16Deneris E.S. Connolly J.

All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. In vitro transcripts were prepared using the mRNA capping kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Preparation of Xenopus laevisoocytes and microinjection of the cRNA was performed as described previously (19Cardoso R.A. Yamakura T. Brozowski S.J. Chavez-Noriega L.E. Harris R.A. Anesthesiology. 1999; 91: 1370-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Isolated oocytes were placed in modified Barth's saline containing (in mm): NaCl 88, KCl 1, HEPES 10, MgSO4 0.82, NaHCO3 2.4, CaCl2 0.91, and Ca(NO3)2 0.33 adjusted to pH 7.5. The α and β nAChR subunit cRNAs (10–60 ng/30 nl in a 1:1 molar ratio) were injected into the cytoplasm of oocytes. The injected oocytes were singly placed in Corning cell wells (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) containing incubation medium (sterile modified Barth's saline supplemented with 10 mg/liter streptomycin, 10,000 units/liter penicillin, 50 mg/liter gentamicin, 90 mg/liter theophylline, and 220 mg/liter pyruvate) and incubated at 15–19 °C. On 2–5 days after injection, oocytes were used in electrophysiological recording. Oocytes expressing wild-type and mutant nAChRs were placed in a rectangular chamber (approximately 100 μl volume) and perfused (2 ml/min) with Ba2+-Ringer's solution to minimize the effects of secondarily activated Ca2+-dependent Cl− currents (115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmKCl, 1.8 mm BaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 1 μm atropine sulfate. The animal poles of oocytes were impaled with two glass electrodes (0.5–10 megohm) filled with 3 m KCl and voltage-clamped at −70 mV using a Warner Instruments model OC-725A (Hamden, CT) oocyte clamp. Acetylcholine (ACh) was dissolved in Ba2+-Ringer's solution and applied for 20 s. For examination of anesthetic effects on various mutant nAChRs, we standardized the experiment by using EC50 concentrations of ACh of each receptor,i.e. concentrations giving 50% of the maximal response calculated based on agonist dose-response curves (Table I), although anesthetic effects on nAChRs were independent of the concentration of ACh used for nitrous oxide (11Yamakura T. Harris R.A. Anesthesiology. 2000; 98: 1095-1101Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar), isoflurane (19Cardoso R.A. Yamakura T. Brozowski S.J. Chavez-Noriega L.E. Harris R.A.

The anesthetic concentrations in the text represent the final bath concentrations quantified by gas chromatography as described previously (20Dildy-Mayfield J.E. Eger E.I., II Harris R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 1058-1065PubMed Google Scholar). For nitrous oxide and xenon, concentrations tested were the maximal concentrations that could be achieved in our perfusion system (11Yamakura T. Harris R.A. Anesthesiology. 2000; 98: 1095-1101Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Anesthetics were pre-applied for 1 min before being coapplied with agonists. Initial studies using longer pre-application times indicated that pre-application for 1 min produced a maximal effect. Exposure to anesthetics alone produced no current response of receptors tested. A 5–10 min washout period was allowed between drug applications. Effects of anesthetics were expressed as the fraction of control responses which were evoked before and after anesthetic applications to take into account possible shifts in the control current throughout the experiment. Data were obtained from oocytes taken from at least two different frogs. All experiments were performed at room temperature (23 °C). Dose-response data for ACh were fitted to the equation, I/Imax = 1/[1 + (EC50/A)n ], where Irepresents the current, Imax the maximal current, EC50 the agonist concentration for half-maximum response, A the ACh concentration, and n the Hill coefficient. Dose-inhibition data for isoflurane were fitted to the equation, I/Icon = 1/[1 + (B/IC50)n ], where Irepresents the current, Icon the control current, B the isoflurane concentration, IC50the inhibitor concentration for half-control response, and nthe Hill coefficient. Parameter estimation was carried out by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). The results obtained were statistically analyzed by t tests or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Scheffe's multiple comparison tests. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. Data are represented as mean ± S.E. X. laevis female frogs were purchased from Xenopus I (Ann Arbor, MI). Nitrous oxide and xenon were obtained from Airgas-Southwest, Inc. (San Antonio, TX). Acetylcholine chloride, pentobarbital sodium, 1-hexanol, 1-octanol, ketamine hydrochloride, iodine, and other reagents were purchased from Sigma; isoflurane from Baxter Pharmaceutical Products (Liberty Corner, NJ); propanethiol from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, WI); methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA) and propyl methanethiosulfonate (PMTS) from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. (Ontario, Canada). PMTS was first dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, then diluted in Ba2+-Ringer's solution to a final dimethyl sulfoxide concentration of 0.03%. This concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide did not affect current responses of nAChRs. The αβ heteromeric neuronal nAChRs (α2β2, α2β4, α3β2, α3β4, α4β2, and α4β4) were expressed in Xenopusoocytes, and effects of nitrous oxide were examined by measuring current responses to EC50 concentrations of ACh during incubation of nitrous oxide (0.58 atmosphere (atm)). Nitrous oxide inhibited nAChRs in a fully reversible manner. Nitrous oxide inhibited α2β2, α3β2, and α4β2 receptors by 33–40%, whereas it inhibited α2β4, α3β4, and α4β4receptors by 5–10% (Fig. 1). Perfusion of 100% nitrogen produced no measurable effect on these receptors, ruling out the involvement of oxygen displacement from the solutions (11Yamakura T. Harris R.A. Anesthesiology. 2000; 98: 1095-1101Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Thus, sensitivity of neuronal nAChRs to nitrous oxide was dependent on β subunits, and β2 subunits were much more sensitive than β4 subunits. To identify the region which determines sensitivity of β subunits to nitrous oxide, chimeric subunits between β2 and β4subunits were constructed (Fig. 2). The β2-224-β4 chimeric subunit was composed of the β2subunit sequence from the amino terminus to the junction site (residue 224) near the middle of the first transmembrane segment (TM1) and composed of the β4 subunit sequence from the junction site to the carboxyl terminus. When the β2-224-β4 subunit was coexpressed with α4 subunits, the resultant receptors were only slightly inhibited by nitrous oxide (Fig. 2). Conversely, receptors composed of the reciprocal β4-224-β2 chimeric subunit were inhibited by nitrous oxide to the same extent as those of wild-type β2 subunit. Thus, sensitivity to nitrous oxide appears to be dependent on the carboxyl-terminal side of the residue 224. The β2-298-β4 chimeric subunit, which is composed of the β2 subunit sequence from the amino terminus to the junction site (residue 298) near the end of the third transmembrane segment (TM3) with the remainder being the β4 subunit sequence, was sensitive to nitrous oxide, whereas the reciprocal β4-298-β2 chimeric subunit was insensitive, indicating that sensitivity to nitrous oxide is dependent on the amino-terminal side of residue 298. Data obtained from these chimeras suggest that sensitivity to nitrous oxide of nAChRs is dependent on the region between the middle of TM1 and the end of TM3 of the β subunit. We compared the amino acid sequences of TM1-TM3 of rat and human nAChR β2 and β4 subunits. Because differences in sensitivity to nitrous oxide between β2 and β4 subunits were also observed for human nAChR subunits (data not shown), we reasoned that the responsible residues would be consistently different between β2 and β4 subunits for both rat and human subunits. In this region, only two amino acid residues satisfied this requirement; these residues correspond to β2-Val253 (or β4-Phe255) near the middle of TM2, and β2-Val272 (or β4-Ile274) in the linker region between TM2 and TM3 (Fig. 3). We then mutated these residues and tested sensitivity to nitrous oxide after co-expression with α4 subunits. The replacement of the residue β2-Val253 by phenylalanine, the homologous residue of β4 subunit (mutation β2-V253F) reduced the sensitivity of α4β2 receptor to the level of α4β4 receptors. Conversely, the reciprocal mutation by valine (V) (β4-F255V) increased the sensitivity of α4β4 receptors to the level of α4β2 receptors (Fig. 4 A). Similarly, the difference in sensitivity to another gaseous anesthetic, xenon (0.46 atm), between β2 and β4 subunits was reciprocally converted by the mutations β2-V253F and β4-F255V (Fig. 4 B). On the other hand, the mutation of another site (β2-V272I) in the linker region between TM2 and TM3 did not change anesthetic sensitivity of α4β2 receptor (39 ± 1% inhibition (n = 6) by 0.58 atm nitrous oxide).Figure 4Effects of the mutations β2-V253F and β4-F255V on sensitivity of nAChRs to various anesthetics.

Wild-type or mutant β subunits were co-expressed with α4 subunits, and anesthetic effects on the current responses of resultant receptors to EC50 concentrations of ACh were examined. Each column represents the mean ± S.E. of measurement of 6–10 oocytes. In vivo anesthetic EC50 values of nitrous oxide, xenon, isoflurane, pentobarbital, and hexanol correspond to 1.0–1.5 atm (32Firestone L.L. Miller J.C. Miller K.W. Roth S.H. Miller K.W.

Pharmacol. 1989; 96: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next examined effects of these mutations on sensitivity to other general anesthetics. Slight differences in sensitivity to the volatile anesthetic isoflurane which is known to potently inhibit nAChRs were observed between β2 and β4 subunits as previously reported (7Violet J.M. Downie D.L. Nakisa R.C. Lieb W.R. Franks N.P. Anesthesiology. 1997; 86: 866-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The α4β2 receptors were inhibited by 60 or 300 μm isoflurane significantly more than the α4β4 receptors (p < 0.001, Fig. 4, C and D). Anesthetic sensitivity of α4β2 receptors was reduced by the mutation β2-V253F to the level of α4β4receptors, and that of α4β4 receptors was increased by the mutation β4-F255V to the level of α4β2 receptors (Fig. 4, C andD). The intravenous anesthetic pentobarbital and the long chain alcohol hexanol exhibited marked differences in sensitivity between β2 and β4 subunits. Pentobarbital inhibited the α4β2 and α4β4 receptors by 78 ± 1 and 37 ± 2%, respectively (n = 3), at 50 μm, and inhibited them by 89 ± 1 and 53 ± 1%, respectively (n = 5–6), at 100 μm. Hexanol (1.14 mm) inhibited α4β2 and α4β4 receptors by 77 ± 1 and 30 ± 2% (n = 6–7), respectively. Inhibition of α4β2 receptors by pentobarbital and hexanol was reduced by the mutation β2-V253F to the level of α4β4 receptors, while inhibition of α4β4 receptors was increased by the mutation β4-F255V to the level of α4β2 receptors (Fig. 4, E andF). On the other hand, the mutation β2-V272I in the linker region between TM2 and TM3 did not affect sensitivity of α4β2 receptor to 50 μmpentobarbital (77 ± 1% inhibition (n = 5)) and to 300 μm isoflurane (83 ± 1% inhibition (n = 5)). These results suggest that differences in anesthetic sensitivity between β2 and β4subunits are determined by a single amino acid residue near the middle of TM2 of β subunits. We next replaced the residue β2-Val253 with other amino acid residues having larger molecular volume such as tryptophan (W) and tyrosine (Y), because replacement with large amino acid residues at the sites in TM2 and TM3 critical for anesthetic modulation of GABAA and glycine receptors abolished the anesthetic effects (21Mihic S.J.

The resultant α4β2-V253W and α4β2-V253Y receptors displayed increased ACh sensitivity (EC50 values of 0.07 and 0.04 μm, respectively, Table I) compared with that of wild-type α4β2receptors (EC50 values of 2.1 μm). The marked changes in apparent affinity for ACh by mutations suggest that this position is involved in channel gating of nAChRs. The α4β2-V253W and α4β2-V253Y receptors were completely insensitive to nitrous oxide (2 ± 1 and 1 ± 1% inhibition by 0.58 atm nitrous oxide, respectively (n = 4)). Isoflurane inhibition of α4β2 receptors was markedly decreased by the mutation β2-V253Y (Fig. 5 A). Isoflurane (600 μm) inhibited α4β2 receptors by 94%, whereas it inhibited α4β2-V253Y receptors only by 14% (Fig. 5 B). Effects of the mutation β2-V253W on isoflurane inhibition were much less than those of the mutation β2-V253Y, but was more than those of the mutation β2-V253F. Inhibition by pentobarbital and hexanol was also markedly reduced by mutations β2-V253W and β2-V253Y (Fig. 5, C and D). The mutation β2-V253Y reduced pentobarbital inhibition more than the mutation β2-V253W, whereas both mutations almost abolished the effects of hexanol on α4β2receptors. On the other hand, ketamine inhibition of α4β2 receptors was not significantly affected by mutations β2-V253F, β2-V253W, and β2-V253Y (Fig. 5 E), nor by the mutation β2-V272I in the TM2–3 linker region (40 ± 1% inhibition (n = 5)). Because mutations at residue β2-Val253 markedly changed ACh sensitivity, effects of anesthetics on ACh dose-response relationships were examined in both wild-type and mutant nAChRs. Hexanol (1.14 mm) reduced the maximal responses of α4β2receptors without changing the EC50 values (2.1 ± 0.3 and 2.4 ± 0.4 μm in the absence and presence of hexanol, respectively (n = 4)) (Fig. 5 F). Similarly, 1.14 mm hexanol reduced the maximal responses of α4β2-V253Y receptors without changing the EC50 values (0.04 ± 0.003 and 0.04 ± 0.005 μm in the absence and presence of hexanol, respectively (n = 4)) (Fig. 5 F). These results suggest that hexanol inhibits both wild-type and mutant nAChRs in a non-competitive manner. We examined whether the homologous site of the α subunit is involved in determining sensitivity of nAChRs to anesthetics. The homologous residue α4-Val254 was replaced with phenylalanine (mutation α4-V254F) or tyrosine (mutation α4-V254Y), and anesthetic sensitivity was tested after co-expression with β2 subunits. The mutation α4-V254F only slightly reduced isoflurane inhibition of α4β2 receptors, whereas the mutation α4-V254Y clearly decreased isoflurane inhibition (Fig. 6 A). Inhibition by pentobarbital and hexanol was markedly reduced by mutations α4-V254F and α4-V254Y (Fig. 6, Band C). Effects of the mutation α4-V254Y were significantly stronger than those of α4-V254F for three anesthetics. The double mutation of α4-V254F and β2-V253F did not appear to further increase the effect of each single mutation on anesthetic sensitivities (data not shown). The α4-V254Y/β2-V253Y receptors produced no current response to ACh (up to 10 mm). An unconventional anesthetic propanethiol or a methanethiosulfonate (MTS) derivative analogous to propanethiol, PMTS, were recently shown to covalently bind to cysteines introduced into specific sites in TM2 of GABAAand glycine receptors, and irreversibly enhance receptor function (15Mascia M.P. Trudell J.R. Harris R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9305-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To examine whether residues β2-Val253 and homologous α4-Val254 of nAChR subunits are involved in the anesthetic-binding site, we employed this approach for nAChRs. We first tested effects of propanethiol on α4β2 and α4β2-V253C receptors. Propanethiol (2 mm) reversibly inhibited current responses of α4β2 receptors by 65 ± 3% (n = 3) and α4β2-V253C receptors by 37 ± 4% (n = 3). However, oxidation by 0.5 mm iodine for 1 min, which promotes disulfide formation between propanethiol and cysteine residues, often irreversibly inhibited current responses of either receptor by itself, precluding examination of propanethiol effects under oxidation conditions. We then examined effects of other sulfhydryl-specific reagents. Because the substituted cysteine residues at homologous position of muscle α1 and β1 nAChR subunits are shown to react with the positively charged, hydrophilic compound MTSEA (24Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Archdeacon P. Karlin A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 25Zhang H. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7952-7964Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we examined this compound for neuronal nAChRs. Treatment with 2.5 mm MTSEA in the presence of EC50 concentrations of ACh for 1 min irreversibly increased current responses of α4β2, α4-V254Cβ2, and α4β2-V253C receptors by 29 ± 10, 41 ± 15, and 40 ± 4%, respectively (n = 4–5). After treatment with MTSEA in the presence of ACh, isoflurane inhibition was prominently decreased for α4-V254Cβ2 and α4β2-V253C receptors, but not"

L. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 21873–21877). We now have identified three short oligopeptide regions in the C-terminal domain which impact cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) maturation and stability in different ways. A highly conserved hydrophobic patch (region I) formed by residues 1413–1416 (FLVI) was found to be crucial for the stability of the mature protein. Nascent chain stability was severely decreased by shortening the protein by 81 amino acids (1400X). This accelerated degradation was sensitive to proteasome inhibitors but not influenced by brefeldin A, indicating that it occurred at the endoplasmic reticulum. The five residues at positions 1400 to 1404 (region II) normally maintain nascent CFTR stability in a positional rather than a sequence-specific manner. A third modulating region (III) constituted by residues 1390 to 1394 destabilizes the protein. Hence the nascent form regains stability on further truncation back to residues 1390 or 1380, permitting some degree of maturation and a low level of cyclic AMP-stimulated chloride channel activity at the cell surface. Thus while not absolutely essential, the C-terminal domain strongly modulates the biogenesis and maturation of CFTR. Some disease-associated truncations within the 100-residue domain C-terminal of the second nucleotide-binding domain destabilize the mature protein (Haardt, M., Benharouga, M., Lechardeur, D., Kartner, N., and Lukacs, G.

As an adenine nucleotide binding cassette (ABC) protein it contains two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2) and two transmembrane domains (TMD1 and TMD2), each spanning the membrane several times. CFTR also has a large R-domain between NBD1 and TMD2 which is not common to other ABC proteins and is the site of regulatory phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (3Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J.

Additionally there are N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains of less than 100 amino acids each that precede TMD1 and follow NBD2, respectively. The former has recently been shown to participate in channel regulation by interacting with the R-domain (7Naren A.P. Cormet-Boyaka E. Fu J. Villain M. Blalock J.E. Quick M.W. Kirk K.L.

Wild-type CFTR matures very inefficiently following synthesis on membrane-bound ribosomes (13Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and many disease-associated mutations in different domains preclude the formation of any mature protein that can be transported to the cell surface. Hence, it is important to understand the role of each domain of the molecule in achieving and maintaining a mature and stable conformation. Frameshift or premature stop mutations found in patients with cystic fibrosis that cause truncations at several locations in the C-terminal domain were shown to destabilize the mature CFTR protein so that its lifetime was greatly shortened (10Haardt M.

We have now made systematic stepwise truncations as well as deletions and substitutions across the entire C-terminal domain and identified different short sequences which strongly influence not only the stability of the mature protein but also the maturation and stability by the nascent chain. The major determinant of the steady state amount of mature protein is a hydrophobic “patch” formed by residues 1413 to 1416 whereas there are strong “positional effects” on the nascent chain of sequences closer to NBD2. Truncation back to residue 1400 resulted in an extremely unstable nascent chain, degraded at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the proteasome. Strikingly, on further truncation back to residues 1390 or 1380 the nascent protein regains stability such that some mature protein is again formed that mediates a low but detectable level of cAMP-stimulated chloride efflux. These findings reveal that C-terminal motifs and their positioning have a major impact on the assembly and stability of the CFTR ion channel. All C-terminal truncations were constructed by polymerase chain reaction introducing a TAG stop codon flanked by an ApaI restriction site. The polymerase chain reactions were performed on pBQ4.7 CFTR plasmid DNA. The antisense primers introducing the stop codon were the following: A1440X, 5′-TGATATCGGGCCCCTATTGCCGGAAGAGGCTCCTCTCGTT-3′; S1435X, 5′-TGATATCGGGCCCCTACCTCTCGTTCAGCAGTTTCTGGATGG-3′; L1430X, 5′-TGATATCGGGCCCCTATTTCTGGATGGAATCGTACTGCCGCAC-3′; D1425X, 5′-TGATATCGGGCCCCTAGTACTGCCGCACTTTGTTCTCTTCTATG-3′; K1420X, 5′-TGATATCGGGCCCCTAGTTCTCTTCTATGACCAAAAATTGTTGGC-3′; V1415X, 5′-TGATATCGGGCCCCTACAAAAATTGTTGGCATTCCAGCATTGC-3′; C1410X, 5′-TGATATCGGGCCCCTATTCCAGCATTGCTTCTATCCTGTGTTC-3′; E1405X, 5′-TGATATCGGGCCCCTATATCCTGTGTTCACAGAGAATTACTGTGC-3′; C1400X, 5′-TGATATCGGGCCCCTAGAGAATTACTGTGCAATCAGCAAATGC-3′; E1405X, 5′-TGATATCGGGCCCCTATATCCTGTGTTCACAGAGAATTACTGTGC-3′; C1395X, 5′-TGATATCGGGCCCCTAATCAGCAAATGCTTGTTTTAGAGTTCTTC-3′; Q1390X, 5′-TGATATCGGGCCCCTATTTTAGAGTTCTTCTAATTATTTGGTATGTTAC-3′; T1380X, 5′-TGATATCGGGCCCCTATACTGGATCCAAATGAGCACTGGGTTC-3′. The sense primer was derived from nucleotides 3551–3579 (5′-TGAGTACATTGCAGTGGGCTGTAAACTCC-3′). The fragments generated by polymerase chain reaction were subcloned into pBluescript SK+. The BprPI-ApaI fragment of the created plasmids was then used to replace the corresponding fragment of pNUT-D1270V CFTR. This plasmid, derived from pNUT-CFTR, contains an engineered ApaI site at the 3′ end of CFTR. 2X.-B. Chang and J. R. Riordan, unpublished data. Replacements of various amino acids with alanine and the deletion of amino acids 1400 to 1404 (Δ1400–1404) were constructed using the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. A modified pBQ4.7 (M1475V CFTR, with CFTR coding sequence identical to the one in pBQ6.2 (14Rommens J.M. Dho S. Bear C.E. Kartner N. Kennedy D. Riordan J.R. Tsui L.-C. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The BprPI-ApaI fragment of pBQ 4.7 M1475VCFTR and the derived mutated plasmids were used to replace the corresponding fragment of pNUT-D1270V CFTR. The sequences of all inserted fragments were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Baby hamster kidney cells grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 were stably transfected and analyzed as described earlier (15Loo M.A. Jensen T.J. Cui L. Hou Y.-X. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R.

Cells were washed twice with PBS containing 0.1 m CaCl2 and 1 mmMgCl2 (PBS++) and incubated for 2 min with 10 mm sodium periodate in PBS++ in the dark. Cells were washed twice with 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, with 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2and incubated for 1 min with 1 mm biotin-LC-hydrazide (Pierce), in the same buffer, in the dark. The labeling buffer was aspirated and cells were incubated for 2 min in 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mCaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2 to stop the reaction. After washing 5 times with ice-cold PBS++, cells were lysed and biotinylated proteins were isolated with immobilized streptavidin (Pierce) as we have described recently (17Chang X. Cui L. Hou Y.

Stably transfected BHK-21 cells were starved in methionine-free medium for 30 min, labeled for 20 min with 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine, and chased with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 1 mm methionine and 5% fetal bovine serum. Cell lysis and immunoprecipitation were performed as described before (15Loo M.A. Jensen T.J. Cui L. Hou Y.-X. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6879-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). With the exception of the 1380X CFTR mutant, all immunoprecipitations were performed using the monoclonal antibody M3A7 (16Kartner N. Augustinas O. Jensen T.J. Naismith A.L. Riordan J.R. Nat. Genet.. 1992; 1: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Since the molecule 1380X does not contain the complete M3A7 epitope, it was immunoprecipitated with the L12B4 antibody (16Kartner N. Augustinas O. Jensen T.J. Naismith A.L. Riordan J.R. Nat. Genet.. 1992; 1: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The amount of35S-radioactivity in each band was quantified by electronic autoradiography using a Packard Instant Imager. Brefeldin A (BFA), lactacystin,N-acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal (ALLN),N-carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal (MG132), and 4-hydroxy-5-iodo-3-nitrophenylacetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-vinylsulfone (NLVS) were added to cells 90 min prior to methionine starvation to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml (BFA) and 10 μm (NLVS) or 50 μm (lactacystin, MG132, and ALLN) and were present during the pulse labeling and chase period. Cells were grown on coverslips and fixed in 100% methanol at −20 °C for 10 min. CFTR was detected by indirect immunofluorescence as described previously (17Chang X. Cui L. Hou Y. Jensen T.J.

The plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase was detected by the mouse monoclonal antibody 5F10 (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.) and visualized with Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG conjugate (dilution 1:250, Molecular Probes). To visualize CFTR and the plasma membrane ATPase simultaneously, the mouse monoclonal anti-CFTR antibody BJ570 was biotinylated with NHS-biotin (Pierce) as described by Harlow and Lane (18Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) and detected with streptavidin Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (dilution 1:1500, Molecular Probes). The chloride efflux assay was performed exactly as we have described recently (17Chang X. Cui L. Hou Y. Jensen T.J. Aleksandrov A.A. Mengos A. Riordan J.R. Mol.

Cells grown in 6-well culture dishes were loaded with loading buffer containing 0.5 μCi of Na36Cl (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed with efflux buffer, and stimulated with forskolin-containing buffer.

We decided to further elucidate sites within the C-terminal domain that impact maturation and stability of both nascent and mature CFTR. As a first step, systematic incremental truncations terminating at the points indicated in Fig.1 A were constructed and expressed. As shown in Fig. 1 B the most C-terminal 40 residues of the CFTR sequence distinguish it entirely from other related human ABC proteins. The final four residues of this CFTR-specific segment form a PDZ domain binding motif (11Wang S. Raab R.W. Schatz P.J. Guggino W.B. Li M.

Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). No function has yet been attributed to the remainder of this 40 residue block (residues 1440–1476). Fig. 1 C shows that truncation at this point to form a 1440X variant had no apparent effect on the steady state amounts of the immature, core-glycosylated form of CFTR (lower band) or the mature form with complex oligosaccharide chains (upper band). Apparently no major changes in these amounts occur when truncation of as many as 61 residues occurs, i.e. to form 1420X. However, truncation of a further five residues from this point resulted in a major reduction in the amount of the mature band (1415X). Shortening the C-terminal region by an additional five residues (1410X) nearly eliminated the mature protein band. Hence a portion of the polypeptide between residues 1410 and 1419 appears to play an important role in the formation or maintenance of mature CFTR. The intensity of the immature band also appeared to be significantly reduced on shortening from 1415X to 1410X (Fig. 1 C). The next three incremental shortenings to 1405X, 1400X, and 1395X were without apparent additional effect; the mature band was barely detectable and the immature band remained fainter when compared with 1415X and was weakest at 1400X. Strikingly, deeper truncation to 1390X resulted in a significant increase in the amounts of both bands, the immature band appearing nearly as strong as in the much longer constructs and the mature band as strong as at 1415X. Further shortening to 1380X resulted in a still larger amount of the mature band. To ensure that the mature form of CFTR reach the plasma membrane surface, labeling was carried out with the membrane-impermeable reagent biotin-LC-hydrazide (Fig.1 D). Mature forms of 1390X CFTR and 1380X CFTR were found to be biotinylated. These observations suggest that some sequence C-terminal of residue 1390 is actually destabilizing and emphasizes the fact that CFTR biogenesis and maturation can occur reasonably effectively in the complete absence of the C-terminal domain beyond NBD2. However, certain short regions within the domain have strong modulating effects, both positive and negative. At least three different short segments of the C-terminal domain have significant impact on the steady state amounts of immature and mature CFTR observed. The influence of these truncations on the intracellular localization of CFTR in stably transfected BHK-21 cells was evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopy. Simultaneous staining with an antibody to the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase showed that wild-type CFTR is detectable as a uniform staining over the entire cell surface, some of which is punctate in nature (Fig.2 A). Clearly visible beneath the surface staining was a more intense perinuclear pattern corresponding well with ER localization in these cells. Overall this distribution was similar to that observed with CFTR expression in other nonpolar mammalian cells and the same as that observed in BHK cells expressing a CFTR-green fluorescent protein fusion (15Loo M.A. Jensen T.J. Cui L. Hou Y.-X. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6879-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Truncation to remove the last 41 C-terminal amino acids (1440X) did not change the wild-type picture (Fig. 2 B). However, shortening by 20 more residues to 1420X resulted in some decrease in cell surface staining while perinuclear staining remained intense. With the 1400X truncation only a very circumscribed perinuclear pattern was seen, consistent with the presence of primarily the core-glycosylated immature band seen in immunoblots (Fig. 1) and immunoprecipitates (Fig.3). Shortening by a further 10 or 20 residues to 1390 or 1380 caused the reappearance of weak staining over the cell surface. Hence there was good correspondence between the relative amount of the mature CFTR band detected in Western blots of whole cell lysates (Fig. 1 C) and cell surface staining by immunofluorescence among the different truncations (Fig. 2).Figure 3Pulse-chase experiments showing the turnover of the immature and mature forms of wild-type and C-terminal truncations of CFTR. Cells were starved of methionine for 30 min, pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml) for 15 min, and chased with methionine replete medium for the times indicated in hours. Immunoprecipitations were preformed as described (15Loo M.A. Jensen T.J. Cui L. Hou Y.-X. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6879-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, gels were dried, exposed to x-ray films, and then separately subjected to quantitative electronic autoradiography to enable estimation of the proportion of the initial 35S radioactivity in the immature band after the pulse, which is present in either band at subsequent chase times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Pulse-chase experiments were performed to determine the kinetic effects of each of these truncations on nascent chain maturation or degradation and on the lifetime of the mature molecule once it was formed (Fig. 3). As has been consistently observed in a variety of different mammalian cell types, wild-type CFTR matures inefficiently with 40% or less of the pulse-labeled immature band converted to the mature band during the chase. This maximal conversion occurs in ∼2 h after which little or no immature band is detectable and the amount of radioactively labeled mature band remains nearly constant until 4 h since it has a half-time of ∼16 h in these cells (13Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Other observations showed that the rate of disappearance of the immature band is slowed by proteasome inhibitors without augmenting the amount that is converted to the mature product (25Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 26Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar) suggesting that a large proportion (in this case ∼60%) of nascent chain was degraded by the proteasome. Truncations to produce 1440X, 1435X, 1430X, and 1425X did not drastically change this precursor-product relationship of nascent and mature CFTR. Notably the maximal proportion of the pulse-labeled nascent 1420X that matured was closer to 30% than 40% and the mature band decayed somewhat more rapidly than wild-type. As was already apparent from the Western blots (Fig. 1) truncation to 1415X had a more major impact. In the pulse-chase experiment the immature band disappeared somewhat more slowly, less mature band appeared and it then turned over more rapidly. The rates of nascent chain disappearance and mature form appearance and disappearance were similar to that of 1410X and 1405X, although the maximum proportion of mature protein formed decreased progressively with shortening. By 1400X this proportion was minimal (∼7% at 1 h of chase). Strikingly, despite the fact that conversion to the mature form was barely detectable, the immature 1400X band disappeared extremely rapidly, i.e. shortening from 1405X to 1400X greatly accelerated the rate of disappearance of the nascent chain. Unexpectedly, removal of a further 5 residues to produce 1395X seemed to cause a reversion to a situation more similar to 1405X than 1400X. A more pronounced restabilization and maturation was exhibited by 1390X. In fact the curve showing the rates of disappearance of the immature band were again quite similar to much longer variants including the wild-type as if residues C-terminal of 1390 destabilized the nascent chain. Formation and maintenance of mature 1390X, however, remained considerably depressed. Further shortening to 1380X, essentially to the C-terminal end of NBD2, had little additional effect. Overall these kinetic data confirm and extend the detection by the immunoblots of three different short segments, within the N-terminal portion of the C-terminal 100 residue domain of CFTR, which have major influences on the stability of the nascent and mature forms of the molecule. These segments lay within a 40-residue stretch immediately C-terminal of NBD2; the most C-terminal 60 residues have little influence on the turnover of immature and mature CFTR and presumably play other roles. The three short segments delineated by the deletions are highlighted in Fig. 4 A and are seen to be reasonably well conserved in CFTRs from different species. Numbering from the C-terminal end, these segments include region I, which when removed greatly reduced mature CFTR, consisting of amino acids 1413 to 1417, all of which except 1417E are hydrophobic, region II (1400–1404) which seems necessary for nascent chain stability, and region III (1390–1394) which has the opposite effect, i.e.destabilizes the nascent molecule. Haardt et al. (10Haardt M. Benharouga M. Lechardeur D. Kartner N. Lukacs G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21873-21877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) reported that naturally occurring C-terminal truncations increased the rate of turnover of the mature form. We observed that C-terminal truncation of 66 amino acids or more decreased the amount of mature protein drastically. Our truncations in steps of five residues suggested the involvement of region I. When all five residues from 1413 to 1417 (FLVIE) were replaced by alanine, the effect was essentially the same as truncation after position 1410,i.e. no mature CFTR band was detected by Western blotting (Fig. 4 B). To determine the crucial residues within region I, alanine substitutions were also made in pairs and individually. Each of the four contiguous hydrophobic residues appeared to contribute and substitution of the Phe1413-Leu1414 pair by alanines was nearly as detrimental as removing all four. Hence a short hydrophobic patch of at least two residues seems to be required for the appearance of the mature protein. Substitution of the glutamic acid at position 1417 was entirely without effect as was replacement of the nonconserved glutamate at 1418 and substitution of the two glutamines flanking this patch on the N-terminal side (Fig. 4 A). In pulse-chase experiments just traces of the large band with complex oligosaccharides could be detected (less than 5%) which turned over rapidly (Fig. 4 D). The nascent chain, however, persisted with a half-life longer than the wild-type protein. The absence of mature CFTR on subs"

In particular, the inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme, also known as kininase II, can protect against cardiac ischemia, putatively via accumulation of bradykinin. To address whether an increase in kinin formation is sufficient to protect against cardiac ischemia, we studied transgenic rats harboring the human tissue kallikrein gene TGR(hKLK1) under the control of the metallothionein promoter, which drives expression of the transgene in various organs including the heart. We subjected the isolated hearts from transgenic rats and their transgene negative littermates to ex vivo regional cardiac ischemia and reperfusion. During the experiment, the hearts were treated with either vehicle or the specific bradykinin type 2 receptor antagonist HOE 140 (10-9 M). In the transgenic rats, overflow of nucleotide breakdown products upon reperfusion was significantly less (455 +-54 nmol/min/g in transgene negative rats vs. 270+-57 nmol/min/g in the transgenic rats, P."
https://openalex.org/W2089254396,"Transfer of reducing equivalents from NADPH to the cytochromes P450 is mediated by NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase, which contains stoichiometric amounts of tightly bound FMN and FAD. Hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions between FAD and amino acid residues in the FAD binding site of the reductase serve to regulate both flavin binding and reactivity. The precise orientation of key residues (Arg454, Tyr456, Cys472, Gly488, Thr491, and Trp677) has been defined by x-ray crystallography (Wang, M., Roberts, D. L., Paschke, R., Shea, T. M., Masters, B. S., Kim, J.-J. P. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 8411–8416). The current study examines the relative contributions of these residues to FAD binding and catalysis by site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analysis. Mutation of either Tyr456, which makes van der Waals contact with the FAD isoalloxazine ring and also hydrogen-bonds to the ribityl 4′-hydroxyl, or Arg454, which bonds to the FAD pyrophosphate, decreases the affinity for FAD 8000- and 25,000-fold, respectively, with corresponding decreases in cytochrome creductase activity. In contrast, substitution of Thr491, which also interacts with the pyrophosphate grouping, had a relatively modest effect on both FAD binding (100-fold decrease) and catalytic activity (2-fold decrease), while the G488L mutant exhibited, respectively, 800- and 50-fold decreases in FAD binding and catalytic activity. Enzymic activity of each of these mutants could be restored by addition of FAD. Kinetic properties and the FMN content of these mutants were not affected by these substitutions, with the exception of a 3-fold increase in Y456SKmcyt c and a 70% decrease in R454E FMN content, suggesting that the FMN- and FAD-binding domains are largely, but not completely, independent. Even though Trp677 is stacked against the re-face of FAD, suggesting an important role in FAD binding, deletion of both Trp677 and the carboxyl-terminal Ser678decreased catalytic activity 50-fold without affecting FAD content. Transfer of reducing equivalents from NADPH to the cytochromes P450 is mediated by NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase, which contains stoichiometric amounts of tightly bound FMN and FAD. Hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions between FAD and amino acid residues in the FAD binding site of the reductase serve to regulate both flavin binding and reactivity. The precise orientation of key residues (Arg454, Tyr456, Cys472, Gly488, Thr491, and Trp677) has been defined by x-ray crystallography (Wang, M., Roberts, D. L., Paschke, R., Shea, T. M., Masters, B. S., Kim, J.-J. P. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 8411–8416). The current study examines the relative contributions of these residues to FAD binding and catalysis by site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analysis. Mutation of either Tyr456, which makes van der Waals contact with the FAD isoalloxazine ring and also hydrogen-bonds to the ribityl 4′-hydroxyl, or Arg454, which bonds to the FAD pyrophosphate, decreases the affinity for FAD 8000- and 25,000-fold, respectively, with corresponding decreases in cytochrome creductase activity. In contrast, substitution of Thr491, which also interacts with the pyrophosphate grouping, had a relatively modest effect on both FAD binding (100-fold decrease) and catalytic activity (2-fold decrease), while the G488L mutant exhibited, respectively, 800- and 50-fold decreases in FAD binding and catalytic activity. Enzymic activity of each of these mutants could be restored by addition of FAD. Kinetic properties and the FMN content of these mutants were not affected by these substitutions, with the exception of a 3-fold increase in Y456SKmcyt c and a 70% decrease in R454E FMN content, suggesting that the FMN- and FAD-binding domains are largely, but not completely, independent. Even though Trp677 is stacked against the re-face of FAD, suggesting an important role in FAD binding, deletion of both Trp677 and the carboxyl-terminal Ser678decreased catalytic activity 50-fold without affecting FAD content. The flavoprotein NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase, which mediates the transfer of electrons from NADPH to the cytochromes P450 and other microsomal electron acceptors, is one of a family of FMN- and FAD-containing enzymes (1Porter T.D.

X-ray crystallographic studies confirmed this hypothesis, demonstrating that this interconnecting region is organized into a unique structural domain that interacts with both flavin binding regions and appears to be responsible for aligning the isoalloxazine rings end to end with the dimethylbenzene rings facing each other at a spacing of approximately 4 Å (15Wang M.

Unlike FMN, FAD is tightly bound to the reductase (17Vermilion J.L. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8812-8819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kurzban G.P. Strobel H.W. J. Biol.

Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Residues comprising the FAD binding site include 455YYSIASS461,471ICAVAVEY478,488GVAT491, and Trp677 (Fig. 1). The isoalloxazine ring of FAD is sandwiched between two aromatic groups, with Trp677 stacked against the re-face and Tyr456 positioned at a 60° angle to the si-face, an arrangement similar to that of the FMN binding site (15Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Main chain atoms of Ser457, Tyr455, Cys472, and Val474 are also within hydrogen bonding distance of the isoalloxazine ring. The phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr456 forms a hydrogen bond with the ribityl 4′-hydroxyl, with Arg454 and Tyr455main chain atoms also interacting with the ribityl moiety. Residues Cys472 through Tyr478 lie nearly parallel to the ribityl pyrophosphate, while the negative charge of the pyrophosphate is stabilized by the Arg454 and Thr491 side chains and the polypeptide backbone of residues 489–491 of the N-helix.Figure 1The FAD binding site of NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase.

Substitutions within the FAD binding site produced 1.7–300- fold decreases in cytochrome c reductase activity and 100–25,000-fold decreases in FAD binding. Although the FMN- and FAD-binding domains appear to be structurally autonomous, evidence is presented for interactions between the two domains, possibly via the interconnecting domain. Finally, unlike FMN, FAD binding does not require the presence of an aromatic group stacked against the re-face of the isoalloxazine ring. Expression and purification of recombinant NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase were carried out as described previously (9Shen A.L. Porter T.D. Wilson T.E. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7584-7589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception that cultures were grown and induced at 28 °C, and the preparation of spheroplasts was omitted. Protein was assayed by the BCA method (20Smith P.K. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Reactions for measurement of cytochrome creductase activity (0.27 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.7, 50 μm NADPH, and 65 μm cytochromec) were carried out at 28 °C and were initiated by the addition of protein. The formation of reduced cytochrome cwas monitored at 550 nm on a Beckman DU7500 spectrophotometer. For determination of rates of flavin dissociation, proteins were diluted into either 0.27 or 0.01 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.7, to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml. After preincubation at 28 °C for the indicated times, reactions were initiated by the addition of NADPH (50 μm) and cytochrome c (65 μm), and initial rates were determined. Reconstitution of FAD-deficient proteins with FAD was carried out by incubation with a 2-fold molar excess of FAD for 30 min. Unbound FAD was removed by diluting the samples 10-fold with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.7, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, followed by centrifugation through a Centricon 50,000 molecular weight cut-off filter. FMN and FAD content was determined by boiling protein samples for 5 min in the dark, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × gfor 10 min to remove coagulated protein. The absorbance of the released flavins was measured at 450 nm, and the FMN/FAD ratio was determined by measurement of fluorescence at pH 7.7 and 2.6 (excitation at 450 nm, emission at 535 nm) (21Faeder E.J. Siegel L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the FAD binding domain provides valuable information on the role of specific amino acid side chains in flavin binding and in maintaining the proper orientation for reduction and electron transfer. Fig. 2 presents the effects of FAD binding site substitutions on flavin content. R454E and Y456S mutants exhibited the greatest changes in FAD binding, with the FAD contents of individual preparations ranging from undetectable to approximately 0.1 mol of FAD/mol of enzyme. Introduction of the bulky leucyl side chain at position 488 also produced a dramatic decrease in FAD content (∼80%), while replacement of Thr491 with valine reduced FAD content by approximately 50%. FAD incorporation was unaffected by the C472T, W677Y, S678X (Ser678 deleted), and W677X (Trp677 and Ser678 deleted) mutations. With the exception of R454E, FAD binding site substitutions did not affect FMN incorporation. Introduction of a negative charge at position 454 had the additional effect of decreasing FMN content by approximately 70%, while replacement of Tyr456 on thesi-face of FAD with serine blocked FAD binding but had no effect on FMN content. The marked decrease in R454E FMN content suggests that an interaction between the two flavin domains, responsible for stabilizing FMN binding, may have been disrupted. Removal of the carboxyl-terminal residue, Ser678, of NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase had no effect on the catalytic activity or kinetic properties of the reductase (TableI). Although we were able to express and purify the W677Y and the W677X proteins and evaluate their flavin contents and enzymatic properties, both proteins exhibited a decreased affinity for 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose, suggesting that modifications of the carboxyl-terminal region of the reductase may lead to changes in protein conformation similar to that seen with ferredoxin-NADP+reductase (22Calcaterra N.B.

For Kmmeasurements, concentrations of one substrate were held constant (65 μm cytochrome c forKmNADPH and 50 μm NADPH forKmcytc), and the concentration of the other substrate was varied. Values are expressed as mean ± S.D. (number of preparations). With the exception of mutations involving Trp677, cytochrome c reductase activities paralleled the observed decreases in flavin content (Table I). Substitutions of Arg454 and Tyr456 produced the largest decreases in enzymic activity (338- and 250-fold, respectively), while introduction of a bulky leucyl side chain at Gly488 had a considerably reduced effect (42-fold). The approximate 50% decrease in FAD content of T491V correlated with a similar decrease in cytochromec reductase activity, while substitution of Cys472 with threonine or deletion of Ser678 had little or no effect on activity. Although amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of the reductase do not bind FAD directly, the carboxyl-terminal region appears to be important in catalysis and in maintaining an active protein conformation. Thus, the W677Y substitution produced a modest decrease (37%) in specific activity, while deletion of Trp677 and Ser678 decreased activity by 97%, with no change in flavin content. Additional kinetic properties of the FAD binding site mutants are presented in Table I. The R454E, G488L, and T491V constructs exhibited markedly reduced catalytic activities without affecting eitherKmNADPH orKmcyt c , consistent with the premise that the primary alteration in these mutants is associated with FAD binding. Conversion of Tyr456, situated at thesi-face of the isoalloxazine ring, to serine increasedKmcyt c , while all substitutions involving Trp677, which is stacked against the re-face of the flavin, were associated with decreases in KmNADPH but did not significantly alter Kmcyt c. The addition of FAD to those mutants deficient in this flavin resulted in either the partial or full restoration of cytochrome creductase activities (Table II). FAD restored full cytochrome c reductase activity to the Y456S and T491V mutants, while activities of the R454E and G488L mutants were restored to approximately 50% of wild type. The dependence of cytochrome c reductase activity on FAD concentration was used to calculate KmFAD and ΔG values for FAD binding (Table II). The T491V substitution was least disruptive, with approximately a 100-fold decrease in FAD binding affinity, indicating that the hydroxyl group of Thr491 contributes 2.8 kcal/mol of binding energy. In contrast, the R454E substitution produced a 25,000-fold decrease in FAD binding, corresponding to a destabilization of 6.0 kcal/mol. Effects of the Y456S and G488L substitutions were intermediate, with 8000- and 800-fold decreases in FAD binding (5.3 and 4.0 kcal/mol), respectively.Table IIFAD dependence of cytochrome c reductase activityProteinKmFADΔGVmaxμmkcal/molμmol/min/mg proteinWild type<0.001 2-aData from Ref. 18.57.4 ± 7.1 (4) 2-bSpecific activity of wild-type enzyme (no FAD added).R454E25.1 ± 2.6 (3)6.027.0 ± 7.1 (3)Y456S7.8 ± 1.2 (3)5.341.9 ± 7.2 (3)G488L0.8 ± 0.2 (3)4.032.3 ± 6.5 (3)T491V0.12 ± 0.04 (3)2.853.3 ± 6.7 (3)Reactions contained 0.27 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.7, 65 μm cytochrome c, 50 μm NADPH, and varying amounts of FAD.

Reactions were carried out at 28 °C and initiated by the addition of protein. Values are expressed as mean ± S.D. (n). For those mutants with elevated KmFADand also measurable reductase activities (e.g. G488L and T491V), enzymic activity decreased rapidly over the course of the reaction, suggestive of FAD dissociation upon dilution into the assay buffer. Deviation from linearity is illustrated for T491V in Fig. 3. Linearity could be restored by inclusion of FAD in the assay buffer, confirming that the nonlinear behavior was due to FAD dissociation. The rate of FAD dissociation from T491V was measured by preincubation of the wild-type and mutant proteins in 0.27 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.7, at 28 °C, prior to initiation of the cytochromec reductase assay (Fig. 4). The wild-type enzyme exhibited a slow decrease in activity (Fig. 4 A) with a rate constant (k1 = 0.012 s−1) consistent with FMN dissociation (12Hodgson A.V. Strobel H.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast, preincubation of the T491V protein in 0.27 mphosphate buffer yielded a biphasic curve with a rapid initial loss of activity (k1 = 0.09 s−1), followed by a continued decrease in activity (k2 = 0.016 s−1) (Fig. 4 B). Inclusion of FAD, but not FMN, in the preincubation buffer prevented loss of activity. Dissociation was ionic strength-dependent, so that only a single slow (k1 = 0.01 s−1) phase was observed when T491V was preincubated in 0.01 m phosphate buffer (Fig. 4 B). In order to evaluate the relative flavin binding affinities of various mutants, the effect of urea on flavin release was measured (Fig. 5 and TableIII). Dilution of wild-type reductase into 2 m urea produced a time-dependent increase in fluorescence, which corresponded to the release of approximately 55% of the total protein-bound flavin, consistent with the release of FMN but not FAD (12Hodgson A.V. Strobel H.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast, the magnitude of the fluorescence change for the T491V and Y456S mutants was significantly greater than 50% of the total fluorescence change, indicating dissociation of both FMN and FAD. The T491V mutant exhibited 77% of the total fluorescence change, with a rate constant 2.4 times that of wild-type. Although very little FAD was present in the Y456S mutant, this protein was reconstituted with FAD, and the rate of dissociation was measured. Dilution of the reconstituted Y456S protein into urea produced 85% of the total fluorescence change, again consistent with dissociation of both FMN and FAD, with a rate constant 3.5 times the wild-type rate. Flavin dissociation from the G488L mutant was biphasic and was characterized by a rapid initial increase in fluorescence, with a rate 30 times that of wild type, followed by a slower increase.Table IIIEffect of FAD binding site substitutions on rates of flavin dissociation in ureaProteink1k2Percentage of maximum 3-aCalculated as described in the legend to Fig. 4.s−1s−1%Wild type0.10 ± 0.00455Y456S0.35 ± 0.0185G488L3.18 ± 0.60.16 ± 0.0258T491V0.24 ± 0.00477Rate constants were calculated from changes in fluorescence reported in Fig. 4.3-a Calculated as described in the legend to Fig. 4.

Distinct binding regions for the prosthetic groups FMN and FAD were first identified through sequence homology (2Porter T.D. Kasper C.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1682-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), while subsequent crystallographic studies showed that these flavin binding sites existed as unique structural domains (15Wang M.

Unlike FMN, FAD is tightly bound to the reductase, with a Kd < 1 nm (23Kurzban G.P. Howarth J. Palmer G. Strobel H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12272-12279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), corresponding to a binding energy of >12 kcal/mol. Specific side chain interactions with FAD have been identified by crystallography, and the current study has evaluated the relative contributions of some of these interactions to flavin binding and the biochemical behavior of the reductase. Evidence has been presented both for the relative independence of the FMN- and FAD-binding domains as well as for interactions between the domains, which may be mediated through the interconnecting region (15Wang M.

The side chains of Arg454 and Tyr456 are major determinants of FAD binding, while hydrogen bonding interactions between the FAD pyrophosphate and the N-helix make smaller contributions. In terms of binding energy, replacement of the hydrogen bond(s) between the guanido group of Arg454 and the FAD pyrophosphate with a repulsive interaction (R454E) destabilizes FAD binding by 6.0 kcal/mol, while removal of van der Waals interactions between the phenyl group of Tyr456 and the FAD isoalloxazine ring and disruption of hydrogen bonding between the phenolic hydroxyl and the C4 ribityl hydroxyl decrease FAD binding by 5.3 kcal/mol. Hydrogen bonding between Thr491 and the FAD pyrophosphate contributes 2.8 kcal/mol to FAD binding. Destabilization of FAD binding by 4.0 kcal/mol by the G488L substitution confirms the importance of stabilization of the negative charge of the pyrophosphate by peptide amides of the N-helix and the Thr491 aliphatic hydroxyl, as suggested by crystallographic studies of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (24Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R. Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) and NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (15Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). A second distinguishing feature of the FAD binding site is the bracketing of the isoalloxazine ring by Tyr456 and Trp677 (15Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Although the FMN and FAD domains of the reductase are structurally similar, with both isoalloxazine rings sandwiched between aromatic groups (9Shen A.L. Porter T.D. Wilson T.E. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7584-7589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), the relative contributions of Tyr456 and Trp677 to FAD binding are in contrast to those seen for Tyr140 and Tyr178 in the FMN binding site. It is interesting, however, that for both FAD and FMN it is the aromatic side chains interacting with thesi-face that bind most strongly with their respective flavins. Hence, in the case of FAD, Tyr456, positioned at a 60° angle to the si-face of FAD, has a major influence on flavin binding, while Tyr140, positioned at a 60° angle to the re-face of FMN, has only a minor effect on FMN binding. Trp677 is stacked against the re-face of FAD; however, removal of Trp677 has little or no effect on FAD content, while Tyr178, which is stacked against thesi-face of FMN, is critical for FMN binding (9Shen A.L. Porter T.D. Wilson T.E. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7584-7589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the normal FMN levels exhibited by the Y456S, G488L, and T491V mutants are consistent with the relative independence of the FMN- and FAD-binding domains, three separate observations clearly suggest that one can influence the other. First, replacement of Arg454, which does not contact the FMN domain, with an aspartyl residue significantly reduces the FMN content of the mutant protein, perhaps by altering the interaction between the two flavin domains and/or the interconnecting region. Second, the Y456S mutation produced a 3-fold increase in Kmcyt c. Hence, Tyr456 may influence cytochrome c binding, which is thought to be associated with the FMN domain, or the alteredKmcyt c may reflect changes in some other step in the catalytic cycle, such as the rate of electron transfer to cytochrome c (25Sem D.S. Kasper C.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12012-12021Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Tyr456 may influence FAD redox potential either through van der Waals interactions and/or hydrogen bonding between the ribityl 4′-hydroxyl and N1 of the isoalloxazine ring. The latter interaction was demonstrated to stabilize the reduced flavin of a related flavoprotein, electron transfer flavoprotein (26Dwyer T.M. Mortl S. Kemter K. Bacher A. Fauq A. Frerman F. Biochemistry. 1999; 3: 9735-9745Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), resulting in an increase in redox potential. Third, replacement of Tyr178, which is essential for FMN binding, with aspartate also markedly decreased FAD content, suggesting an interdependence between the two flavin centers (9Shen A.L. Porter T.D. Wilson T.E. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7584-7589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary effect of substitutions of Trp677 is on catalysis and pyridine nucleotide binding rather than FAD binding. The W677X mutant exhibits decreased catalytic activity independent of any change in flavin content, as well as a decreasedKmNADPH (Table I). Although binding of NADPH to the wild-type reductase has been shown to depend primarily on interactions with the 2′-phosphate group and Arg597 (10Sem D.S. Kasper C.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11548-11558Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the W677X protein exhibits an increased affinity for NADPH. In the case of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase, it has been suggested that the carboxyl-terminal residue must move to accommodate NADPH (24Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R. Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 27Deng Z. Aliverti A. Zanetti G. Arakaki A.K. Ottado J. Orellano E.G. Calcaterra N.B. Ceccarelli E.A. Carillo N. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Hubbard et al. have shown that removal of Trp677 does facilitate NADP+ binding to NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (28Hubbard P.A. Paschke R. Kim J.-J.P. Shen A.L. Kasper C.B. Ghisla S. Kroneck P. Marcheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Agency for Scientific Publication, Berlin1999: 159-162Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions between FAD and amino acid residues in the FAD binding pocket of the reductase serve to regulate both flavin binding and reactivity. The present study has utilized site-directed mutagenesis to assess the functional significance of FAD binding site residues identified by x-ray crystallography. Residues 488–491 and Arg454 function primarily in FAD binding, while Tyr456 has dual FAD-binding and catalytic functions and Trp677 regulates pyridine nucleotide binding and catalysis. Finally, the interaction between the two flavins of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase has also been a subject of much interest. Our studies suggest that, although the FMN and FAD domains are competent in binding FMN and FAD independently, alterations in one or the other domain do have an impact on the integrity of the other. Studies to elucidate the mechanism of these interdomain interactions are under way.

https://openalex.org/W2116890114,"We have studied the effect of macromolecular crowding reagents, such as polysaccharides and bovine serum albumin, on the refolding of tetradecameric GroEL from urea-denatured protein monomers. The results show that productive refolding and assembly strongly depends on the presence of nucleotides (ATP or ADP) and background macromolecules. Nucleotides are required to generate an assembly-competent monomeric conformation, suggesting that proper folding of the equatorial domain of the protein subunits into a native-like structure is essential for productive assembly. Crowding modulates GroEL oligomerization in two different ways. First, it increases the tendency of refolded, monomeric GroEL to undergo self-association at equilibrium. Second, crowding can modify the relative rates of the two competing self-association reactions, namely, productive assembly into a native tetradecameric structure and unproductive aggregation. This kinetic effect is most likely exerted by modifications of the diffusion coefficient of the refolded monomers, which in turn determine the conformational properties of the interacting subunits. If they are allowed to become assembly-competent before self-association, productive oligomerization occurs; otherwise, unproductive aggregation takes place. Our data demonstrate that the spontaneous refolding and assembly of homo-oligomeric proteins, such as GroEL, can occur efficiently (70%) under crowding conditions similar to those expected in vivo.

Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar, 2Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hedde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B.

The oligomeric structure defines two large central cavities that have been implicated in binding nonnative protein substrates (4Fenton W.A. Kashl Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 5Llorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The apical domains of GroEL bind substrate proteins with exposed hydrophobic residues, preventing their aggregation. The substrate is displaced into the enclosed cavity after GroES binding, in an ATP-dependent reaction. Compelling evidence indicates that only the oligomeric form of chaperonin can function as a molecular chaperone (6Mendoza J.A. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16973-16976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7White Z.W. Kathryn E.F. Eisenstein E. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 5: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, a central question is how GroEL is folded and assembled. Several studies have described the dissociation of GroEL into monomers by chemical denaturation, proteolysis, or mutagenesis (9Lissin N.M. Venyaminov S.Y. Girshovich A.S. Nature. 1990; 348: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 10Horovitz A. Bochareva E.S. Girshovich A.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1535-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, data on the reconstitution of the functional chaperonin from its unfolded monomers are scarce. It has been demonstrated that monomers that have not been completely unfolded can be reassembled (9Lissin N.M. Venyaminov S.Y. Girshovich A.S. Nature. 1990; 348: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 14Lissin N.M. Hemmingsen S.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15Mendoza J.A. Martinez J.L. Horovitz P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the presence of ammonium sulfate and the Mg2+ complexes of ATP and ADP, fully denatured GroEL monomers can, to a limited extent, be reassembled into a functional, oligomeric protein (16Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22113-22115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This finding proves that the GroEL sequence contains all of the information required for its folding and assembly, although the effect of the above mentioned reagents is not clearly understood. Protein refolding in vitro has been extensively characterized under dilute experimental conditions to avoid aggregation of unstable intermediates. However, the intracellular environment is highly crowded due to the presence of macromolecules at concentrations such that a significant fraction of the intracellular space is not available to other macromolecular species (17Zimmerman S.B. Minton A.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar, 18Minton A.P. Curr. Opin.

The so-called volume exclusion theory (17Zimmerman S.B. Minton A.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar, 20Minton A.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) may probably be applied to protein refolding processes; indeed, there are some examples in the literature (21Burston S.G. Weissman J.S. Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Martin J. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Karmin P. Hahn G.M. Minton A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7107-7111Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Due to the importance of GroEL folding and assembly, we have investigated the effect of protein (BSA)1 and polysaccharides (Ficoll 70 and dextran 70) additives on its spontaneous refolding. Our results show that nucleotide binding, but not hydrolysis, is required to refold the urea-unfolded monomer into an assembly-competent monomer and that excluded volume conditions strongly modulate the oligomerization of the competent monomer into a tetradecameric, active protein. All reagents were analytical grade. Urea, deuterium oxide (D2O), Ficoll 70, and BSA (essentially fatty acid-free) were obtained from Sigma. Dextran 70 was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 13C-Labeled urea was from Cambridge Isotope. Urea was deuterated by three consecutive lyophylizations after dilution in D2O. GroEL was overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described (5Llorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). An additional purification step in methanol (25%, v/v) was carried out to remove most of the remaining bound substrates (25Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). GroEL was denaturated by incubating the protein 1 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 m urea, pH 7.5, as described previously (16Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22113-22115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Refolding of GroEL was initiated by a 10-fold dilution of the concentrated denatured protein into the above buffer without denaturing agent, with vigorous agitation with a Vortex mixer for 30 s, unless otherwise stated. As previously reported, this procedure results in reproducible mixing conditions (23van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 26Goldberg M.E. Rudolph R. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2790-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The same results were found when the samples were diluted 15-fold (not shown). Stock solutions of crowding agents were made in refolding buffer. After the addition and mixing of all components, the final pH of the sample was 7.5 ± 0.06. In the standard assay, refolding was allowed to proceed for 30 min, at 25 °C. The results presented here are the average of at least three independent experiments with three different protein batches. ATPase activity was measured as described previously, using a spectrophotometric method that includes an ATP-regenerating system (27Kreuzer K.N. Jongeneel C.V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 144-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 28Llorca O. Galán A. Carrascosa J.L. Muga A. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32587-32594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Control experiments were carried out to verify that the ATPase activity of native GroEL was unaffected at 0.5 m urea. Protein concentration as determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma), was 60 nm (oligomer), and the temperature was kept at 37 ± 0.3 °C during the experiment. The effect of GroES on the ATPase activity was measured in samples containing GroEL/GroES (1:2 oligomer ratio). Refolding of rhodanase was performed as described previously (29Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13044-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Llorca O. Pérez-Pérez J. Carrascosa J.L. Galán A. Muga A. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32925-32932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Spontaneous folding was monitored by the recovery of rhodanase activity in the standard assay. Chaperonin-assisted refolding was measured in samples containing 170 nm GroEL, 240 nm GroES (both oligomer concentrations), and 2 mm ATP. Samples for IR spectroscopy were prepared by concentrating the refolded protein with microconcentration filters (300-kDa cut-off) to replace the refolding buffer by 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5. Alternatively, the refolded protein was precipitated with 60% ammonium sulfate and centrifuged to remove the crowding reagent. This method was used after 30 min of refolding, when the maximal yield of refolding was achieved (see “Results”), and had no effect on the process itself. However, as previously reported (16Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22113-22115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), when ammonium sulfate was present during the initial stages of refolding, the efficiency of the process was enhanced. D2O/H2O exchange was carried out by repeatedly washing the sample in D2O-based buffer, and finally the protein was concentrated to about 4–6 mg/ml. To study the effect of urea on the IR spectrum of the protein (35 mg/ml),13C-labeled chaotropic agent was used. This avoids overlapping of the stretching vibrations of the C=O groups of urea and of the polypeptide backbone, thus allowing a reliable subtraction of the urea IR signal that is downshifted by 56 cm−1 (31Fabian H. Mantsch H.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13651-13655Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Samples were placed in a thermostated cell between two CaF2 windows separated by either 6 μm (urea samples) or 50 μm (other samples). A total of 1000 scans were accumulated, at 25 °C and 2-cm−1 resolution, for each spectrum using a Nicolet Magna spectrophotometer equipped with an MCT detector. Thermal studies were carried out by a step heating method with 3.5 °C steps, leaving the sample to stabilize for 5 min at each temperature before recording the spectra. The temperature was monitored with a thermocouple in contact with the windows and was stable within 0.4 °C. Solvent subtraction, Fourier self-deconvolution, and band position determination were performed as reported (32Arrondo J.L.R. Castresana J. Valpuesta J.M. Goñi F.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11650-11655Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). GroEL tetradecamers and monomers were resolved by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels. The same samples used for IR spectroscopy were negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate on thin coated collodion grids previously glow-discharged for 15 s. Images of renatured GroEL were taken in a JEOL 1200 EX-II electron microscope operated at 100 KV, as previously described (33Llorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Native and unfolded GroEL (5 m urea) were diluted 10-fold in the desired refolding mixture, as described above. After incubating the samples for 30 min at 25 °C, they were centrifuged for 30 min at 16,000 ×g in a Heraeus Biofuge. The pellets, when present, were washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and dissolved in 1% SDS, and the protein concentration was estimated with the BCA assay. The supernatants were submitted to a second centrifugation step at 250,000 × g (30 min) to discard the presence of smaller aggregates, which were not detected. The soluble protein was precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and after washing the pellets three times to remove any remaining crowder or dithiothreitol, protein concentration was measured as described previously. The spontaneous refolding of GroEL from its unfolded monomers is known to be sensitive to the experimental conditions (16Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22113-22115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The effect of Ficoll 70, a macromolecular crowding agent, on GroEL reactivation has been studied as an additional factor that might modulate its folding and assembly. The use of this “inert,” highly soluble polysaccharide was intended to mimic the intracellular crowded environment that prevails in the cytoplasm (17Zimmerman S.B. Minton A.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar, 18Minton A.P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 19Minton A.P. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1090-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 20Minton A.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The effect of the crowder on GroEL reactivation is shown in Table I. In the absence of nucleotides, and regardless of the presence of polysaccharide, the protein fails to refold into an active structure. In the absence of Ficoll 70, ATP slightly increases the yield of GroEL reactivation, albeit to a limited extent, in good agreement with previously published data (16Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22113-22115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the simultaneous presence of 30% (w/v) Ficoll 70 and ATP in the refolding mixture induces a 3-fold enhancement in the reactivation of GroEL, as compared with the percentage obtained with only ATP. To rule out any possible effect of the background macrosolute on the ATPase activity of the protein or on the activity assay, native GroEL was incubated for 1 h with the highest concentration of crowding agents used in this study and diluted to the same extent as the refolding samples (20-fold) in the ATPase reaction mixture. The specific ATPase activity of these samples was identical to that of native GroEL (not shown), demonstrating that neither Ficoll nor the other crowders used in this study (dextran and BSA; see below) modify the ATPase activity of GroEL measured with this assay. Therefore, the observed differences in reactivation are most likely due to different refolding yields (see below).Table IEffect of Ficoll 70 and ATP on the reactivation and aggregation of GroELControl (native, not unfolded)Refolded1-aRefolding was performed under different experimental conditions, as described under “Experimental Procedures.”30% Ficoll, 5 mm ATP30% Ficoll5 mm ATPNo additiveTotal ATPase (%)1-bThe ATPase activity of the samples was measured after a 30-min incubation of the unfolded protein in the desired refolding buffer and expressed as the percentage of the activity obtained for the same amount of native GroEL.100618205Protein (%)1-cSamples were centrifuged (16,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) and the precipitated protein estimated (Pellet).

Open table in a new tab After measuring the ATPase activity, the samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g (4 °C, 30 min) to pellet any large aggregate that might form during refolding, and the sedimented protein was quantified (Table I). In the presence of crowder, a good correlation between the amount of protein remaining in the supernatant and the ATPase activity data is obtained, suggesting the formation of aggregates larger than the tetradecameric native protein, the latter remaining in the supernatant under these conditions. Moreover, the specific ATPase activity of the supernatant of the sample refolded in 30% Ficoll 70 and ATP was found to be similar (95%) to that of native GroEL, indicating that the nonsedimented protein has a native-like ATPase activity. In the absence of crowder, a significantly lower proportion of protein is found in the pellet than in its presence (Table I). The supernatants were submitted to a second centrifugation step (250,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min) that did not generate any visible pellet, and the soluble protein was precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid and quantified. In the presence of crowder, the results correlate well with those obtained for their corresponding pellets and ATPase activity. However, in the absence of crowder, the data suggest that refolded, inactive GroEL might not form large aggregates and might remain in solution as a monomer and/or in an intermediate oligomerization state (Ref. 16Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22113-22115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar; see below). The 100% values of ATPase activity and protein concentration correspond to native GroEL incubated under the four different experimental conditions described in Table I. Similar activities were found in all four cases. In order to prove that the recovery of ATPase activity was due to protein refolding into a native-like structure, we compared the conformational and functional properties of refolded and native GroEL. The secondary structure and the thermal stability of these samples were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. As previously reported, the deconvoluted amide I band of native GroEL in deuterated buffer shows six components (Fig. 1 A; Ref.34Galán A. Llorca O. Valpuesta J.M. Pérez-Pérez J. Carrascosa J.L. Menéndez M. Bañuelos S. Muga A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), whose tentative assignment can be summarized as follows. The bands at 1656 and 1648 cm−1 might represent two types of α-helices, the latter being distorted and/or solvent-exposed (35Muga A. Mantsch H.H. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2629-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 36Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Chapman D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). The component at 1641 cm−1 contains contributions from irregular (loops, turns) and unordered structures, while the band at 1630 cm−1 is characteristic of β-structures. Finally, those located at 1668 and 1681 cm−1 are usually assigned to turns. The relative band areas of the components corresponding to different secondary structures, as estimated by curve fitting of the amide I band, are in reasonable agreement with the x-ray structure of the protein (not shown) and therefore support the above assignment. As expected, these signals are absent in the IR spectrum of the protein in 5 m13C-labeled urea (Fig. 1 B). It is well known that at this urea concentration, GroEL adopts an unfolded, monomeric conformation (9Lissin N.M. Venyaminov S.Y. Girshovich A.S. Nature. 1990; 348: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 11Mendoza J.A. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25963-25965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lissin N.M. Hemmingsen S.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 16Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22113-22115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The chaotropic agent induces a downshift of the amide I band absorption maximum (from 1648 to 1641 cm−1), which after deconvolution shows one major component at 1639 cm−1 and a minor feature at 1672 cm−1. Similar bands have been described for urea-denatured RNase (31Fabian H. Mantsch H.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13651-13655Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and are consistent with a predominantly random conformation with residual turnlike structures. The IR spectrum of GroEL refolded in 30% Ficoll and ATP, recorded after removing the crowder and the nucleotide, recovers the spectral features characteristic of native GroEL, namely the band components between 1660 and 1690 cm−1 (turns); 1647 and 1657 cm−1 (α-helices); and 1625 and 1630 cm−1 (β-structure) (Fig. 1, C and D), suggesting that refolded GroEL adopts a native-like secondary structure. Note that the position of these component bands depends on the medium in which refolding takes place. In H2O buffer (Fig. 1 C), the bands appear at higher frequencies than in D2O medium (Fig. 1 D), indicating a complete exchange of the unfolded protein with the solvent when refolding is carried out in the latter buffer. Thermal stability studies often reveal subtle differences in protein conformation. This is the case of GroEL, since it has been shown that nucleotides and the oligomerization state of the protein modulate its thermal stability (34Galán A. Llorca O. Valpuesta J.M. Pérez-Pérez J. Carrascosa J.L. Menéndez M. Bañuelos S. Muga A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 37Surin A.K. Kotova N.V. Kashparov V.V. Marchenkov S., Yu Marchenkova G.V. Semisotnov G.V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Increasing temperatures induce clear spectral changes in the amide I absorption band of the protein (Fig.2 A). These are evidenced by the appearance of component bands at 1686 and 1618 cm−1 and a broad one centered at around 1648 cm−1. The former components have been related to the intermolecular aggregation of thermally unfolded protein molecules (35Muga A. Mantsch H.H. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2629-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the broad band is indicative of a fluctuating conformation. The same temperature-induced spectral changes were observed for refolded monomeric and tetradecameric, active GroEL (not shown). As a consequence of these spectral changes, the amide I band broadens, and the midpoint denaturation temperature (T12) of the unfolding transition can be easily estimated by following the width of the amide I band as a function of temperature. The T12 values estimated from the “unfolding curves” shown in Fig. 2 B are 73 and 72 °C for native and refolded tetradecameric GroEL, respectively. This difference is within the experimental error of the measurement. In contrast, monomeric GroEL, obtained upon refolding the protein in the absence of nucleotides and Ficoll, is remarkably less stable as demonstrated by a T12 of 53 °C. Interestingly, this T12 value is also lower than that obtained for a single ring mutant of the protein under similar experimental conditions (64 °C; Ref. 34Galán A. Llorca O. Valpuesta J.M. Pérez-Pérez J. Carrascosa J.L. Menéndez M. Bañuelos S. Muga A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the low solubility of monomeric GroEL hampers its conformational characterization. The above mentioned similarity between refolded and native GroEL also extends to their functional properties, which were characterized by analyzing (i) their interaction with the co-chaperonin GroES, which causes a 53 ± 4% inhibition of the ATPase activity of both samples (not shown), and (ii) their comparable ability to assist productive refolding of rhodanase (Fig.3). As expected, refolded, monomeric GroEL is unable to assist rhodanase refolding under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 3). These data, together with the typical oligomeric structure seen by electron microscopy (Fig. 3,inset), indicate that GroEL refolds into a tetradecameric structure with conformational and functional properties similar to those of the native protein and therefore that reactivation monitors chaperonin refolding and assembly. We next analyzed in more detail the effect of Ficoll 70 and different nucleotides in GroEL refolding and assembly. The time chosen to follow the refolding process (30 min) was determined by analyzing the kinetics of GroEL reactivation in the absence and presence of 30% (w/v) Ficoll 70 (Fig. 4). Although, as mentioned above, the yield of active GroEL recovery is remarkably influenced by the polysaccharide, the time dependence of the refolding reaction is similar for both experimental conditions. Assembly starts without a detectable lag period, proceeds during the first 20 min, and levels off after 30 min, regardless of the presence or absence of Ficoll 70. The extent of GroEL refolding as a function of crowder concentration is summarized in Fig. 5. In the presence of both ATP and ADP, increasing concentrations of Ficoll 70 induce up to a 3-fold enhancement in the reactivation of the refolded protein (Fig. 5,A and B), in contrast to what is observed in their absence (Fig. 5 C). This effect is clearly seen below 20% Ficoll, and higher crowder concentrations increase but slightly the reactivation yield. The concomitant increase in the ratio of tetradecameric/monomeric species observed by native electrophoresis only in the presence of nucleotides (Fig. 5, insets) further suggests that reactivation is due to protein refolding into active protein tetradecamers. It is important to mention that the ATPase activity of refolded, monomeric GroEL was always less than 8% of the activity observed for the native protein (Fig. 5 C), as previously reported (7White Z.W. Kathryn E.F. Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20404-20409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1998590099,"The goal of this study was to examine arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism by murine bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) during apoptosis induced by cytokine depletion. BMMC deprived of cytokines for 12-48 h displayed apoptotic characteristics. During apoptosis, levels of AA, but not other unsaturated fatty acids, correlated with the percentage of apoptotic cells. A decrease in both cytosolic phospholipase A(2) expression and activity indicated that cytosolic phospholipase A(2) did not account for AA mobilization during apoptosis. Free AA accumulation is also unlikely to be due to decreases in 5-lipoxygenase and/or cyclooxygenase activities, since BMMC undergoing apoptosis produced similar amounts of leukotriene B(4) and significantly greater amounts of PGD(2) than control cells. Arachidonoyl-CoA synthetase and CoA-dependent transferase activities responsible for incorporating AA into phospholipids were not altered during apoptosis. However, there was an increase in arachidonate in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and neutral lipids concomitant with a 40.7 +/- 8.1% decrease in arachidonate content in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), suggesting a diminished capacity of mast cells to remodel arachidonate from PC to PE pools. Further evidence of a decrease in AA remodeling was shown by a significant decrease in microsomal CoA-independent transacylase activity. Levels of lyso-PC and lyso-PE were not altered in cells undergoing apoptosis, suggesting that the accumulation of lysophospholipids did not account for the decrease in CoA-independent transacylase activity or the induction of apoptosis. Together, these data suggest that the mole quantities of free AA closely correlated with apoptosis and that the accumulation of AA in BMMC during apoptosis was mediated by a decreased capacity of these cells to remodel AA from PC to PE."

Under in vitro conditions, the Egr-1 gene is expressed in many cell types and is induced by a wide variety of extracellular signals. The mechanisms by which the Egr-1 gene is regulated in vivo remain poorly understood. In this study, we have generated transgenic mice with a construct containing 1200 bp of the mouse Egr-1 promoter coupled to nuclear localized LacZ. In multiple independent lines of mice, reporter gene expression was detected in subsets of endothelial cells, vascular smooth-muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, neurons, and hepatocytes. This pattern closely resembled that of the endogenous gene. After partial hepatectomy, reporter gene activity was upregulated between two- and fivefold in regenerating livers. Taken together, these findings suggest that the Egr-1 promoter contains information for appropriate spatial and temporal expression in vivo."

The malaria parasite spends part of its developmental life cycle in human erythrocytes where it is challenged with enhanced oxidative stress. Therefore the parasite needs efficient anti-oxidants to protect itself against damages, such as nucleic acid modifications, lipid peroxidation, or oxidation of thiol-containing proteins, caused by reactive oxygen species. The thioredoxin redox system, composed of the NADPH-dependent homodimeric thioredoxin reductase (TrxR)1 and the 12-kDa protein thioredoxin (Trx) confers reduction of protein disulfides, ribonucleotide reductase being the most prominent example (1Holmgren A.

One such KDEL-tailed cysteine protease, designated SH-EP, was first isolated from cotyledons of germinated Vigna mungo seeds as the enzyme responsible for degradation of storage proteins accumulated in protein storage vacuoles (PSV) of cotyledon cells (10Akasofu H. Yamauchi D. Mitsuhashi W. Minamikawa T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6733Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Mitsuhashi W. Koshiba T. Minamikawa T. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 628-634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SH-EP is synthesized on membrane-bound ribosomes as a 43-kDa precursor through co-translational cleavage of the signal peptide, and the precursor is processed to the 33-kDa mature enzyme via 39- and 36-kDa intermediates during or after transport to the vacuoles (18Mitsuhashi W.

Based on analysis of the heterologous expression of SH-EP and a KDEL deletion mutant of SH-EP in insect Sf9 cells and subcellular fractionation of cotyledon cells, it was proposed that the KDEL-tail of SH-EP functions to store the enzyme as a transient zymogen in the ER, and that the conversion of the 43-kDa SH-EP into the 42-kDa form in/at the ER is accompanied by the removal of the C-terminal propeptide containing the KDEL-tail (20Okamoto T.

From these observations, the protease responsible for removal of the C-terminal propeptide of SH-EP has been supposed to exist in the lumen of the ER (20Okamoto T. Minamikawa T. Edward C. Vakharia V. Herman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11390-11398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recently, Toyooka et al. (21Toyooka K. Okamoto T. Minamikawa T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 248: 453-463Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar) showed that in cotyledon cells of V. mungo seedlings, a proform of SH-EP synthesized in the ER accumulated at the edge or middle regions of the ER where the transport vesicle was formed. The vesicle, containing a large amount of pro-SH-EP, termed KV, budded off from the ER, bypassed the Golgi complex, and fused to PSV (21Toyooka K. Okamoto T. Minamikawa T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 248: 453-463Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the KDEL-tail of SH-EP functions as the signal for accumulation of pro-SH-EP at the edge or middle regions of the ER where formation of KV proceeds (21Toyooka K. Okamoto T. Minamikawa T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 248: 453-463Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar).In this study, the protease involved in the processing of 43-kDa SH-EP (KDEL-attached form) into 42-kDa SH-EP (KDEL-removed form) was purified to homogeneity from microsomes of cotyledons of V. mungoseedlings, and a cDNA clone for the enzyme was isolated. Immunocytochemical and sucrose gradient analyses of cotyledon cells were carried out to determine the intracellular localization of the protease. The protease was also expressed in insect Sf9 cells in order to observe the characteristics of the membrane association of the enzyme. The possible dual functions of this enzyme in cells will be discussed.DISCUSSIONAlthough MCP was initially isolated as a protease which is involved in post-translational cleavage of the C-terminal propeptide of SH-EP containing the KDEL-tail within the ER, immunocytochemical analysis of cotyledon cells revealed that MCP is localized in PSV as well as the ER, and the amino acid sequence of MCP deduced from its cDNA indicated that the enzyme is a member of papain family which are potentially degradative enzymes. The involvement of MCP in degradation of storage proteins is consistent with the report that an MCP homologue from Vicia faba was isolated as an enzyme responsible for globulin hydrolysis in cotyledons of germinated V. faba seeds (30Yu W.J. Greenwood J.S. J. Exp. Bot. 1994; 271: 261-268Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 31Yu W.J. Greenwood J.S. Plant Physiol. PGR. 1996; 112: 862Google Scholar). It has been shown that there are some kinds of proteinases in the cotyledons of germinated V. mungo seeds (17Mitsuhashi W. Koshiba T. Minamikawa T. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 628-634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Okamoto T. Minamikawa T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and other papain-type proteinases are thought to exist in the cotyledons, however, only MCP showed the proteolytic activity that converts the recombinant 43-kDa SH-EP (C152G) to the 42-kDa form. In addition, general cysteine proteinase, papain, cleaved the recombinant 43-kDa SH-EP (C152G) to the 33-kDa form through removal of the N-terminal prosequence of the proenzyme. This processing profile is apparently different from that of the recombinant 43-kDa SH-EP (C152G) by MCP. This suggest the possibility that the processing activity for the conversion of the recombinant 43-kDa SH-EP (C152G) to the 42-kDa form is unique to MCP.The present results of sucrose gradient centrifugation and immunocytochemistry of cotyledon cells suggest the possibility that MCP exists as an active mature enzyme in the ER in association with the membrane, although papain-type proteases have not been expected to be localized in the ER lumen since the ER is a site for folding and oligomerization of nascent proteins (1Galili G. Sengupta-Gopalan C. Ceriotti A Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 1-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Okita T.W. Rogers J.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

However, MCP was detected as the mature enzyme in a microsome preparation in which SH-EP was presented as the proenzyme (Fig. 8, A and B), suggesting the enrichment of the ER in the microsomal preparation, and supporting the possibility that mature MCP is localized in the ER. Most papain-type proteases are synthesized as zymogens with the large N-terminal proregion which is essential for correct folding of the enzyme (32Vernet T. Berti P.J. deMontigny C. Musil R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13030-13035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the mechanisms are largely conserved among these proenzymes. The N-terminal proregion occluding the active site with antiparallel peptide chains is removed by autocatalytic proteolysis triggered by acidification (40Coulombe R. Grochulaki P. Sivaraman J. Menard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 41Jerala R. Zerovnik E. Kidric J. Turk V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11498-11504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We have also succeeded in in vitroactivation of recombinant pro-SH-EP (22Okamoto T. Yuki A. Mitsuhashi N. Minamikawa T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but recombinant pro-MCP was not converted to the mature enzyme under the conditions of acidic and nutral pH (data not shown). An activation mechanism different from that of pro-SH-EP, procathepsin L, and propapain may account for the activation of pro-MCP. In fact, the in vitro activation mechanism of proforms of proteases belonging to the same subfamily as MCP has not yet been resolved. Therefore, the processing profiles of MCP was analyzed by heterologous expression system in insect Sf9 cells. It is notable that mature MCP was detected only in the membrane protein fraction prepared from Sf9 cells expressing MCP, and that the other MCP-related polypeptides of 35, 37, and 38 kDa were detected only in the soluble protein fraction (Fig. 9 A). In addition, MCP activity derived from expressed MCP was detected in the membrane protein fraction (Fig. 9 C). This suggests that the membrane association of pro-MCP in Sf9 cells is needed for correct processing to the mature form, and pro-MCP in the soluble protein fraction is processed abnormally or degraded to the 35-, 37-, and 38-kDa polypeptides. Membrane association may have a crucial role in post-translational processing of pro-MCP.A hydropathy plot for the MCP protein did not show the existence of a hydrophobic transmembrane domain on the MCP polypeptide (data not shown). Membrane association of papain-type proteases has been reported in procathepsin L (42McIntyre G.F. Erikson A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10588-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 43McIntyre G.F. Godbold G.D. Erikson A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 567-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the soybean cysteine protease P34 (44Herman E.M. Melroy D.L. Buckhout T.J. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 45Kalinski A.J. Weisemann J.M. Matthews B.F. Herman E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13843-13848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Kalinski A.J. Melroy D.L. Dwivedi R.S. Herman E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12068-12076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Procathepsin L associates with microsomal membranes at pH 5 via a 6-amino acid residue region in the N-terminal prosequence, which is similar to the vacuolar targeting sequence of yeast proenzymes, and the binding is essential for transport of the proenzyme from the Golgi complex to lysosomes through a mannose 6-phosphate-independent pathway (43McIntyre G.F. Godbold G.D. Erikson A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 567-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, MCP must associate with the membrane through part of the mature enzyme, rather than the proregion, since mature MCP was detected in the membrane protein fraction (Figs. 8 A and9 A), suggesting that the membrane association process for MCP differs from that for procathepsin L. A candidate amino acid sequence of MCP for association with the microsomal membrane is the N-terminal region of mature MCP, LPANAQKAPILP (Fig. 4 B). The region is positioned upsteam from the N-terminal amino acid residues of the papain-type proteases belonging to the other subfamily, is strongly conserved only among the proteases of the MCP subfamily, and shows high hydrophobicity. This may suggest that this amino acid sequence has some functional role, and investigations to see the biological function of the sequence are now underway in our laboratory. P34, a papain-type protease from soybeans, was first identified as a membrane-associated protease of oil bodies of cotyledon cells of soybean seeds (44Herman E.M. Melroy D.L. Buckhout T.J. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 45Kalinski A.J. Weisemann J.M. Matthews B.F. Herman E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13843-13848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but later reports indicated that p34 is localized in vacuoles, and that disruption of the cells resulted in the release of P34 from vacuoles and subsequently P34 associates with the membranes of oil bodies (46Kalinski A.J. Melroy D.L. Dwivedi R.S. Herman E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12068-12076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that the association of P34 might be only a fortitous event or that the association reflects some aspect of the functions of P34 (46Kalinski A.J. Melroy D.L. Dwivedi R.S. Herman E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12068-12076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility of a merely fortitous association of MCP with the membrane will be ruled out by experiments involving proteinase K treatment of microsomes and subsequent immunoblotting (Fig.8 C). The results strongly supported the conclusion that MCP detected as a membrane-associated protein is localized in the luminal side of the microsomes, and that MCP does not simply bind nonspecifically to the microsomal membrane on the cytoplasmic side during preparation of the microsomes. The specific association of MCP with the luminal membrane is also indirectly supported by the results of immunocytochemistry showing that MCP is localized along the membrane of the ER (Fig. 6 B) and on peripheral regions and membranous structures of specific areas of PSV where degradation of storage proteins is progressing (Fig. 7 B). In addition, the heterologous expression of MCP in Sf9 cells and subsequent sublocalization within the cells revealed that the MCP protein itself possesses the property of associating with the membrane (Fig. 9). From these observations, the features of membrane association of MCP are considered to reflect some biological role. In the ER lumen, soluble proteins are able to move freely, but the movement of membrane-associated proteins is thought to be restricted and it is considered likely that membrane association will result in compartmentalization of the proteins in some region of the lumen. Molecular chaperones in the ER bind to nascent proteins until the nascent proteins are correctly folded or oligomerized (1Galili G. Sengupta-Gopalan C. Ceriotti A Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 1-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Okita T.W. Rogers J.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 327-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 3Vital A. Denecke J. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 615-628PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane association of MCP on the luminal side of the ER may reduce the opportunity for assembly with nascent proteins in the lumen of the ER prior to binding of chaperones to the proteins, resulting in the protection of MCP against nonspecific proteolysis of the protein. Although the in vivo substrates of MCP in the ER lumen remain to be identified, at least MCP was revealed to process the C-terminal prosegment of SH-EP in vitro. One hypothesis is that MCP in the ER lumen is involved in cleavage of the C-terminal region of reticuloplasmins possessing K(H)DEL-tails, resulting in escape from the ERD2 retention system and degradation of the proteins for turnover processes in the vacuoles. We herein postulate that MCP is localized in both the ER and PSV as a membrane-associated protease, and plays dual roles in cells, in the post-translational cleavage during the C-terminal processing of pro-SH-EP, and in the degradation of storage proteins in PSV. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 is the port of entry of proteins into the endomembrane system. In this organelle, there are a number of soluble proteins, membrane proteins, and molecular chaperones which are involved in folding, glycosylation, assembly, and maturation of nascent proteins (1Galili G.

Greenwood J.S. J. Exp. Bot. 1994; 271: 261-268Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 31Yu W.J. Greenwood J.S. Plant Physiol. PGR. 1996; 112: 862Google Scholar). It has been shown that there are some kinds of proteinases in the cotyledons of germinated V. mungo seeds (17Mitsuhashi W. Koshiba T. Minamikawa T. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 628-634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Okamoto T. Minamikawa T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and other papain-type proteinases are thought to exist in the cotyledons, however, only MCP showed the proteolytic activity that converts the recombinant 43-kDa SH-EP (C152G) to the 42-kDa form. In addition, general cysteine proteinase, papain, cleaved the recombinant 43-kDa SH-EP (C152G) to the 33-kDa form through removal of the N-terminal prosequence of the proenzyme. This processing profile is apparently different from that of the recombinant 43-kDa SH-EP (C152G) by MCP. This suggest the possibility that the processing activity for the conversion of the recombinant 43-kDa SH-EP (C152G) to the 42-kDa form is unique to MCP.The present results of sucrose gradient centrifugation and immunocytochemistry of cotyledon cells suggest the possibility that MCP exists as an active mature enzyme in the ER in association with the membrane, although papain-type proteases have not been expected to be localized in the ER lumen since the ER is a site for folding and oligomerization of nascent proteins (1Galili G.

https://openalex.org/W2084486943,"Both analyses of x-ray diffraction patterns of well oriented specimens of trichocyte keratin intermediate filaments (IF) and in vitro cross-linking experiments on several types of IF have documented that there are three modes of alignment of pairs of antiparallel molecules in all IF: A11, A22 and A12, based on which parts of the major rod domain segments are overlapped. Here we have examined which residues may be important for stabilizing the A11 mode. Using the K5/K14 system, we have made point mutations of charged residues along the chains and examined the propensities of equimolar mixtures of wild type and mutant chains to reassemble using as criteria: the formation (or not) of IF in vitro or in vivo; and stabilities of one- and two-molecule assemblies. We identified that the conserved residue Arg10 of the 1A rod domain, and the conserved residues Glu4 and Glu6 of the linker L2, were essential for stability. Additionally, conserved residues Lys31 of 1A and Asp1 of 2A and non-conserved residues Asp/Asn9of 1A, Asp/Asn3 of 2A, and Asp7 of L2 are important for stability. Notably, these groups of residues lie close to each other when two antiparallel molecules are aligned in the A11 mode, and are located toward the ends of the overlap region. Although other sets of residues might theoretically also contribute, we conclude that these residues in particular engage in favorable intermolecular ionic and/or H-bonding interactions and thereby may play a role in stabilizing the A11 mode of alignment in keratin IF.

Based on differences in the organizations of their primary structures and genes, six different types of IF are now known (see Refs. 1Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar, 2Parry D.A.D. Steinert P.M. Intermediate Filament Structure. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995Google Scholar, 3Parry D.A.D.

Biol. 1998; 8: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar for reviews). The type I and type II keratins are the most numerous. In human, for example, each contains approximately 20 members, which are differentially expressed in various epithelial tissues. Each may be further divided into about 20 trichocyte keratin chains expressed almost exclusively in “hard” keratinizing tissues such as hair, and 20 cytokeratins. All keratin (as well as other) IF chains consist of a central rod domain composed of four α-helical segments (1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B) that possess a heptad repeat motif and are separated from one another by non-α-helical linkers. The central rod domain is flanked on the head and tail by domains of differing size and chemical character. A large body of experimental evidence has now documented that the fundamental building block of all keratin IF is the heterodimer molecule, consisting of one type I and one type II chain (1Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar, 2Parry D.A.D. Steinert P.M. Intermediate Filament Structure. R. G.

Although a number of important details remain to be resolved, this molecule is known to be stabilized in large part by the formation of a segmented α-helical coiled-coil by the appropriate parallel alignment of the central rod domain segments on the two chains. The next step is the formation of a pair of such molecules. Typically, this oligomer is the minimal IF structure that exists in solution, especially below the critical protein concentration required for assembly into macroscopic IF (∼40 μg/ml). A number of biophysical, electron microscopic, and biochemical experiments have documented that the two molecules are aligned antiparallel and partly staggered in the A11 or A22 alignment mode, depending on whether the 1A+1B or 2A+2B rod domain segments overlap. Cross-linking data on cytokeratins and trichocyte keratins have revealed that both of these modes co-exist in solution, presumably in equilibrium with each other, as various experimental manipulations allow realignments (8Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Fraser R.D.B. Parry D.A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 436-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 9Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A.D.

Dermatol. 1999; 112: 619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Further, the cross-linking data have afforded quantitative estimates of the degree of overlap of the molecules. Thus, for the A11mode we have documented that the two molecules are displaced by approximately 112 amino acid residues with respect to each other. However, fundamental questions remain concerning the sequence features that specify and stabilize these alignment modes. In this study we have explored in K5/K14 IF which sequences may be involved in stabilizing the A11 alignment mode. In this study, we have tested a current hypothesis that charged residues located along the rod domain segments may be important for molecular registration. Table I lists all possible charged residues that theoretically could be involved. By use of series of point substitutions of charged residues, we have identified several conserved residue positions that are important for stabilizing the A11 alignment mode.Table ICharged residues that are theoretically well sited to form stabilizing ionic salt bond pairs in the A11 alignment modeFirst positionPotential partnerChain/locationAxial position1-aAxial positions are measured in terms ofh cc, which corresponds to a 0.1485-nm rise of each residue in a coiled coil conformation.

Open table in a new tab RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn this paper we have made a systematic analysis of those charged residues that, based on current structural information, are located in rod domain positions that could influence the specificity and stability of the A11 alignment mode of a pair of antiparallel heterodimer molecules in K5/K14 IF. These encompass the segments 1A, 1B, 2A, and beginning of the 2B, as well as the linkers L1, L12, and L2. We found that 41 charged positions have been conserved in the type II keratin 5 (K5) (Fig. 1,upper row) and type I K14 (Fig. 1,lower row) chains. Based on extant ideas (2Parry D.A.D. Steinert P.M. Intermediate Filament Structure. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995Google Scholar, 3Parry D.A.D. Steinert P.M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1999; 32: 99-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 4Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we have hypothesized in this study that some of these may influence molecular alignment stabilities. Indeed, using the known quantitative estimate of molecular spacing of the A11 alignment mode for keratin IF (about −112 residues) (9Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10046-10056Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we document in TableI that most of the 41 conserved charged residue positions lie opposite to each other and so are well sited to theoretically form stabilizing ionic salt bond pairs and/or H-bonds. Nevertheless, we discharged all conserved charged residue positions (i.e. mutated them to a non-charged residue) (all mutations are listed in Table II). In addition, there are 59 residue positions in this set that are not conserved between the K5 and K14 chains, and 4 others that are oppositely charged; several of these are also theoretically good candidates to form stabilizing salt bonds (Table I). Some of these residue positions were discharged as well. We then examined the facility with which equimolar mixtures of one mutant and one wild type chain could assemble into one- and two-molecule oligomers, as well as IF in vitroand in vivo.Assembly of IF in Vitro and in VivoThe initial criterion of assembly competence was formation of pelletable IF particles by use of a sedimentation assay in the Airfuge. Experience has shown that particles must be ≥750 kDa in size in order to pellet with high efficiency. 2L. N. Marekov, D. A. D. Parry, and P. M. Steinert, unpublished observations. This corresponds to an oligomer of as many as 16 chains (8 molecules), i.e.it consists of a full-length half-width entity characteristic of an early stage of IF assembly (17Herrmann H. Häner M. Brettel M. Ku N.O. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1403-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In almost all cases, however, we found empirically that assembly of mixtures of mutant and/or wild type chains either resulted in macroscopic IF (≥0.5 μm long), which were readily pelletable in the Airfuge and clearly visible by electron microscopy after negative staining, or no large IF particles were formed at all (<0.1 μm long and <4 nm wide), which did not pellet in the Airfuge and required examination over holey carbon film grids to be visible.Sixty-six combinations of K5/14 chains were examined in in vitro assays (Fig. 2, Table II). These included every case of a conserved charged residue position in the K5 and K14 chains documented in Fig. 1, as well as several other positions that had not been conserved. Almost all formed pelletable particles in high yield and appeared as native-type IF >1 μm in length. However, several combinations did not, including three positions in the 1A rod domain segment (K14 Asp9 → Ala, Arg10 → Leu, K5 Lys10 → Met, K14 Lys31 → Glu or Lys31 → Met), three positions in the L2 linker (several combinations of K5 and/or K14 in which positions 4, 6, and 7 (K14 chain only) of L2 had been discharged), and three positions in the 2B rod domain segment (residues 100, 104, and 106). In addition, the 2A rod domain residue Asp1 → Ala (K5) produced particles that only partially pelleted in the Airfuge and visibly were only 0.1–0.3 μm in length (Table III).Figure 2Electron microscopy of wild type and IF assembled from wild type and/or mutant K5/K14 chains.

These cells express predominantly the K6, K7, K16, and K17 keratin chains but have been shown previously to accommodate incorporation of transfected wild type or mutant K14 chains (19Albers K.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1477-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Additionally, the efficacy of incorporation of transfected GFP-K14 constructs into cultured cells to explore keratin IF cytoskeletons is now established (20Windoffer R. Luebe R.E. J.

Four mutants (1A Arg10 → Leu (Fig. 3 B), 1A Lys31→ Met (Fig. 3 D), L2 Glu6 → Ala (Fig.3 G), and 2B Glu106 → Ala (Fig.3 H)), resulted in severely disrupted cytoskeletons in which most of the keratin IF had withdrawn to a perinuclear location, and there were bright spots of unassembled GFP-labeled protein. In five other cases, the keratin IF cytoskeletons were either unchanged (1A Lys17 → Met (Fig. 3 C), 1B Lys71→ Ile (data not shown)), or mildly abnormal due to some apparent clumping and/or elongation of the keratin IF (1A Glu22 → Ala (data not shown), 1B Glu56 → Ala (Fig.3 E), and 1B Glu84 → Ala (Fig.3 F)).Figure 3Direct immunofluorescence of wild type and mutant GFP-K14 constructs transfected into PtK2 cells.

The 1A positions 9 and 10 have been shown previously to be sites for mutation in various keratinopathy diseases (18Irvine A.D. McLean W.H.I. Br. J. Dermatol. 1999; 140: 815-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar); in vivo and/orin vitro expression of proteins containing these mutations revealed limited or no IF assembly (21Vassar R. Coulombe P.A. Degenstein L. Albers K. Fuchs E. Cell. 1991; 64: 365-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have recently documented that the 2B residue positions 100, 104, and 106 are required to form stable molecules because they participate in coiled-coil trigger formation in IF (11Steinert P.M. Wu K.C. Parry D.A.D. Morasso M.I. Bryan J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 11: 3539-3558Google Scholar).Cross-linking Studies with DST in Urea Solutions to Assess One- and Two-molecule StabilitiesThe second criterion of assembly competence used in this study was the formation of stable one- and two-molecule assemblies. We have previously established (16Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1657-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) a method to assess the stabilities of single coiled-coil molecules and pairs of them by use of a graduated urea concentration titration assay coupled with cross-linking by DST. At protein concentrations below the critical concentration for IF assembly (∼40 μg/ml) in assembly buffer in the absence of urea, the K5 and K14 chains form mostly two-molecule (and traces of one-, three-, and four-molecule) oligomers (8Steinert P.M.

These dissociate into single molecules at about 6.5 m urea (approximate concentration of half loss), and then the molecules dissociate to individual chains by about 9.5 m urea, as reported earlier by Wawersik et al.

Several observations are apparent (TableIV). First, for only the 2B rod domain positions 100, 104, and 106 were both the two-molecule and single-molecule entities unstable in even 1 m urea. This is expected from our earlier data, as these residues participate in the formation of a stabilizing coiled-coil trigger motif for IF (11Steinert P.M. Wu K.C. Parry D.A.D. Morasso M.I. Bryan J.T.

However, third, there were several conserved charged residue positions that resulted in significantly destabilized two-molecule entities (∼4 m urea), including 1A positions 9 and 10; 2A position 1; and L2 positions 4, 6, and 7. Finally, in a few other positions, the two-molecule entity was somewhat less stable (≤5 m): 1A position 31 and 2A position 3.Table IVMolecular stabilities of K5/K14 wild type and mutant chain assemblies in concentrated urea solutionsComposition[Urea] of half-disassemblyFigureK5K14TetramerDimermWild typeWild type6.594A1AArg1 → LeuWild type6>8Wild typeAsp9 → Ala4>8Wild typeArg10 → Leu3.584BWild typeArg10 → Lys5.5>8Wild typeArg10 → Gln4.58Lys10 → MetWild type3.58Lys10 → ArgWild type5.5>84CAsp16 → AlaWild type>5.58Wild typeLys17 → Met68Wild typeArg19 → Leu>5.58Wild typeGlu22 → Ala5.5>7Wild typeGlu29 → Ala5.58Wild typeLys31 → Glu<58Wild typeLys31 → Met<594D1BWild typeArg12 → Met68Wild typeAsp21 → Ala6>8Glu28 → AlaWild type68Wild typeArg33 → Leu>68Wild typeAsp37 → Ala68Wild typeAsp38 → Ala68Wild typeArg40 → Leu68Lys42 → MetWild type68Wild typeGlu44 → Ala68Lys49 → MetWild type>68Glu54 → AlaWild type>6>8Wild typeAsp56 → Ala6>8Lys61 → MetWild type68Lys62 → MetWild type68Wild typeAsp65 → Ala6>7.5Lys71 → IleWild type5.5>8Wild typeArg71 → Ile5.58Wild typeAsp73 → Ala5.58Wild typeGlu75 → Ala68Wild typeAsp79 → Ala68Wild typeLys82 → Glu>5.58Asp83 → AlaWild type>5.5>7.5Wild typeGlu84→ Ala>5.5>8Lys89 → MetWild type>5.58Wild typeGlu95 → Ala>5.582AWild typeAsp1 → Ala4>7.54EAsp3 → AlaWild type4.58Wild typeGlu8 → Ala>5.58Wild typeArg10 → Leu>5.5>8Glu14 → AlaWild type68Wild typeLys15 → Met68Wild typeLys19 → Met>5.58L2Arg2 → LeuWild type5.5>84FGlu4 → AlaWild type48Wild typeAsp4 → Ala48Glu6 → AlaWild type48Wild typeGlu6 → Ala48Wild typeGlu7 → Ala>48Wild typeAsp4 → Ala/Glu6 → Ala<484GGlu4 → Ala/Glu6 → AlaWild type<48Wild typeAsp4 → Ala/Glu7 → Ala<4>7.5Arg2 → LeuAsp4 → Ala4>7Arg2 → LeuGlu6 → Ala<4>7Arg2 → LeuGlu7 → Ala48Glu4 → AlaAsp4 → Ala<4>7Glu4 → AlaGlu7 → Ala<4.5>7Glu6 → AlaGlu7 → Ala<4>72BWild typeLys4 → Met>5.5>8Wild typeGlu6 → Ala68Wild typeGlu7 → Ala6>8Wild typeGlu17 → Ala>6>8Wild typeLys23 → Ile<1>8Lys100 → MetWild type<11Asp104 → AlaWild type<11Wild typeGlu106 → Ala<114H Open table in a new tab Taken together with the in vivo and in vitro IF assembly experiments, these data reveal that 1A positions 9, 10, and 31; 2A positions 1 and 3; and linker L2 positions 4, 6, and 7 are important for the stability of the two-molecule entity of K5/14.The Arg10 Residue of the 1A Rod Domain Segment and the Glu4 and Glu6 Residues of the L2 Linker Are Especially Required for the Stability of the A11 Mode of Alignment of Two MoleculesWe have documented that there are three possible modes of alignment of a pair antiparallel molecules to form the two-molecule oligomer, known as A11, A22, and A12. In our hands, the A12mode exists only at high pH values and is not assembly-competent (14Steinert P.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 107: 157-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, a variety of chromatographic, ultracentrifugation, electron microscopic, solution birefringence, and cross-linking data have documented that two-molecule oligomer of a variety of mammalian IF exist in assembly-competent solutions as 60–70-nm-long particles in which the two molecules are aligned in the A11 and/or A22 mode. Our previous cross-linking experiments have shown that the two must co-exist in solution, since we have been able to recover DST cross-linked peptides arising from links between antiparallel molecules aligned in both modes (8Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Fraser R.D.B. Parry D.A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 436-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 9Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A.D.

Dermatol. 1999; 112: 619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned in the present experiments that the destabilization of the two-molecule oligomer in the several mutations identified above should be due to loss of one or both of these alignment modes. To check this, we performed additional larger scale cross-linking experiments with 0.4 mm DST. The proteins were then cleaved with CNBr and trypsin, and the resulting peptides were resolved by HPLC (Fig.5), but using a broader and flatter gradient extending over 120 min versus 70 min previously (8Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Fraser R.D.B. Parry D.A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 436-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We found six common peaks in the one- and two-molecule species of wild type K5/14 arising from intramolecular links (Fig. 5 B). In the wild type two-molecule oligomer, there were an additional 15 peaks due to intermolecular links, of which 5 could be assigned to linkages between molecules aligned in the A22 mode (Fig.5 C, closed circles), and 10 to linkages denoting the A11 alignment mode (Fig.5 C, open circles). Semiquantitative data on the amounts of each were determined on the basis of peak areas (all data summarized in Table V). These experiments were repeated for seven mutant mixtures. As found previously (11Steinert P.M. Wu K.C. Parry D.A.D. Morasso M.I. Bryan J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 11: 3539-3558Google Scholar), the Glu106 → Ala substitution in the 2B rod domain segment resulted in loss of the A22 alignment mode, and resultant substantial loss of the A11 mode. However, the 1A Arg10 → Leu (Fig. 5 D) and Lys31 → Met, and L2 Glu6 → Ala single (Fig.5 E) or Glu4 → Ala/Glu6 → Ala double substitutions resulted in almost complete loss of the A11 mode. Further, the yields of the cross-links denoting to the A22 mode were generally increased over the wild type amounts (Table V). These data confirm that the A11 and A22 modes of molecular alignment in fact exist in equilibrium in solution and suggest that loss of the former by destabilization results in a net reduction of the stability of all tetramers, together with an accumulation of molecules into the latter. The Arg10 → Lys substitution in 1A retained near wild type yields of both modes, consistent with the data of Tables III andIV. In summary, these data document that discharging of Arg10 of 1A, or one or both of the acidic residues Glu4 and Glu6 of the L2 linker singly or together, results in loss of the A11 mode of alignment. Discharging of Lys31 in 1A results in substantial loss of the A11 mode.Figure 5HPLC profiles of DST-cross-linked peptides reveal loss of the A11 alignment mode in certain conserved charged residue positions of wild type and/or mutant K5/14 chains.Oligomer sizes and chain compositions are indicated.

Pterin-free NOS exhibits a Soret band (416–420 nm) characteristic of predominantly low spin heme and does not catalyze the formation of nitric oxide (·NO) (Rusche, K. M., Spiering, M. M., and Marletta, M. A. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 15503–15512). Reconstitution of pterin-free NOS with H4B was monitored by a shift in the Soret band to 396–400 nm, the recovery of ·NO-forming activity, and the measurement of H4B bound to the enzyme. As assessed by these properties, H4B binding was not rapid and required the presence of a reduced thiol. Spectral changes and recovery of activity were incomplete in the absence of reduced thiol. Full reconstitution of holoenzyme activity and stoichiometric H4B binding was achieved in the presence of 5 mm glutathione (GSH). Preincubation with GSH before the addition of H4B decreased, whereas lower concentrations of GSH extended, the time required for reconstitution. Six protected cysteine residues in pterin-free NOS were identified by labeling of NOS with cysteine-directed reagents before and after reduction with GSH. Heme and metal content of pterin-free and H4B-reconstituted NOS were also measured and were found to be independent of H4B content. Additionally, pterin-free NOS was reconstituted with 6-methylpterin analogs, including redox-stable deazapterins. Reconstitution with the redox-stable pterin analogs was neither time- nor thiol-dependent. Apparent binding constants were determined for the 6-methyl- (50 μm) and 6-ethoxymethyl (200 μm) deazapterins. The redox-stable pterin analogs appear to bind to NOS in a different manner than H4B.

Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15638-15645Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).The respective roles of the heme and H4B cofactors in the NOS mechanism are not yet clear. The first step of the reaction, the hydroxylation of arginine, appears to require the involvement of the heme due to the inhibition of the reaction by CO (10White K.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6627-6631Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). However, hydrogen peroxide and iodosobenzene fail to support this reaction (18Pufahl R.A. Wishnok J.S. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1930-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and pterin-free NOS does not catalyze arginine hydroxylation in the presence of either hydrogen peroxide or NADPH (19Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, H4B appears to play a role in the first step of the reaction. H4B has been proposed to participate in electron transfer in NOS. Bec et al. (20Bec N. Gorren A.C.F. Voelker C. Mayer B. Lange R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13502-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) infer a role for H4B in the reduction of the ferrous dioxygen complex of the heme by one electron to form the heme-derived oxidant, which would result in a pterin radical. Raman et al. (21Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) subsequently suggested, based on structural evidence, that the H4B-binding site could stabilize a pterin radical cation (21Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Direct evidence of a pterin radical, which is proposed to be formed in the arginine reaction, has been obtained by rapid freeze-quench electron paramagnetic resonance studies of the iNOS heme domain (22Hurshman A.R. Krebs C. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15689-15696Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Evidence to support heme catalysis in the oxidation of NHA to citrulline and ·NO consists of inhibition of the reaction by CO (23Pufahl R.A. Marletta M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and studies of peroxide-dependent catalysis (18Pufahl R.A. Wishnok J.S. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1930-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 24Clague M.J. Wishnok J.S. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14465-14473Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Additionally, a direct role for the heme in the second step of the reaction is supported by the fact that oxidation of NHA is catalyzed by pterin-free NOS (19Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, the reaction of NHA catalyzed by pterin-free NOS yields different products than the reaction catalyzed by H4B-bound NOS. It is not clear what the role of H4B may be in the oxidation of NHA. It is apparent, though, that H4B performs one or more crucial functions in the mechanism of NOS.Structural roles for H4B have also been proposed based on the observed effects of H4B on substrate affinity for NOS (25Klatt P.

H4B binds near the heme, the nitrogens of the pyrimidine ring interacting with a heme propionate group. H4B also interacts with residues from the symmetry-related subunit, forming a link between the subunits of the dimer. In addition, the structures revealed a metal-binding site at the dimer interface in which a zinc atom is coordinated to four cysteine residues, two from each monomer (21Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P.

The ability to reconstitute this enzyme with H4B and recover all physical and catalytic properties complements previous studies of pterin-free NOS reactivity (19Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These studies support a role for reduced thiol in the reconstitution of H4B as also observed by Sono et al. (39Sono M. Ledbetter A.P. McMillan K. Roman L.J. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Dawson J.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15853-15862Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We have studied the process and requirements of pterin reconstitution of the full-length iNOS in the absence of substrate utilizing H4B as well as the 6-methyl analogs, including redox-stable deazapterins (Fig. 1). Reconstitution was assessed by spectral changes, quantitation of bound H4B, and recovery of ·NO-forming activity.DISCUSSIONPterin-free NOS exhibits a Soret band (416–420 nm) characteristic of predominantly low spin heme.

We have studied the process and requirements of H4B binding to pterin-free NOS in the absence of substrate. This is important in that l-arginine (or NHA) binding alone effects a low to high spin shift of the NOS Soret band. In addition,l-arginine increases the apparent affinity of NOS for H4B, and H4B increases the apparent affinity for l-arginine. Thus in experiments containing both substrate and pterin cofactor, particularly those relying solely on spectral data, the influence of one compound cannot be isolated from the influence of the other. The shift of the pterin-free NOS Soret band occurred rapidly in the presence of H4B and reduced thiol (Fig. 3 A) and did not require the presence of substrate as previously observed with the nNOS heme domain (39Sono M. Ledbetter A.P. McMillan K. Roman L.J. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Dawson J.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15853-15862Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Sono et al. (39Sono M. Ledbetter A.P. McMillan K. Roman L.J. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Dawson J.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15853-15862Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) observed low to high spin shifts of the heme domain Soret upon extended (24 h to 10 days) incubations with H4B and DTT (with or without arginine). Since our experiments were carried out with the full-length enzyme, we were able to correlate the observed spectral changes with full recovery of ·NO-forming activity (Fig. 3 B). We also carried out extensive characterizations of these forms of the enzyme by H4B, heme, and metal quantitation as well as cysteine-labeling experiments. In the absence of reduced thiol, H4B alone effects little change in the pterin-free NOS spectrum and achieves reconstitution of only approximately 50% of full activity (Fig. 4). It is important to remember that pterin-free NOS does not catalyze turnover of arginine in the absence of added H4B (19Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). For ease of comparison in the activity reconstitution experiments, however, zero time points were designed to control for H4B reconstitution that may occur uponl-arginine binding or turnover in the assay. This was accomplished by assaying pterin-free NOS in the presence of H4B with or without GSH at concentrations that corresponded to those in assays of the timed incubations.These results have indicated that facile and complete H4B reconstitution requires the presence of reduced thiol. Because these experiments were carried out under strictly anaerobic conditions and formation of oxidized pterin in H4B-only studies was not observed in the spectral experiments (<2%), the presence of reduced thiol was not required to maintain a pool of reduced pterin. We considered the possibility that reduced thiol could function to chelate the NOS-bound zinc molecule, which might aid H4B binding by relaxing structural constraints. The zinc stoichiometry of pterin-free NOS incubated with GSH alone, however, was unchanged relative to either pterin-free or H4B-reconstituted NOS (data not shown). Apparently, a thiol functions to reduce an NOS moiety, which in the oxidized form, interferes with H4B reconstitution. This proposal is supported by the dependence of H4B reconstitution on thiol concentration (Fig. 5 A), the increased rate of absorbance change observed upon preincubation of pterin-free NOS with GSH (Fig. 5 B), and the inability of the oxygen-substituted GSH analog, GOH, to facilitate H4B reconstitution (Fig. 5 A). These data as well as the inability of ascorbate to substitute for GSH imply that a protein disulfide must be reduced for facile H4B binding and recovery of activity. To examine this hypothesis, labeling of NOS cysteine residues before and after reduction with DTT was carried out. Of the six cysteine residues labeled only after reduction, two ligate a zinc atom in combination with the equivalent two cysteine residues from the opposing subunit (21Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P.

Kim J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) does not explain the protection of the remaining two cysteine residues in the heme domain and the two in the reductase domain. It is unlikely but not impossible that some cysteine residues might be inaccessible to the labeling reagent due to structural constraints even though the reactions were carried out in 5 m guanidine HCl. However, based on the results presented in this study it is tempting to speculate that one or more disulfide bonds (intra- or intersubunit) involving these residues are formed during expression and/or purification of NOS in the absence of H4B and reduced thiol. This disulfide bond would then interfere with H4B binding and recovery of activity, perhaps by constraining the structure of the enzyme. The previously observed effects of GSH to stimulate H4B-bound neuronal NOS activity and stabilize activity over long (15–60 min) assays (52Hofmann H. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13443-13452Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was proposed to be due to reduction of protein thiols, which interact with the pterin-binding site of NOS. Although direct interaction of protein cysteine residues with the pterin-binding site is not observed in the NOS structures (21Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 37Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A.

Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), the function of GSH in those studies may indeed have been in the reduction of a protein disulfide, which interfered with H4B binding, as supported by the results presented here.Another interesting result of these studies is the observation that the redox-stable pterin analogs, DZPH4 and EtOMeDZPH4, did not bind to pterin-free NOS in the same fashion as H4B. The absorbance changes effected by the redox-stable analogs were similar to those occurring upon H4B binding. However, the redox-stable analogs bound pterin-free NOS in a concentration-dependent (not time-dependent) manner, without a dependence on the presence of reduced thiol. One difference between the redox-stable analogs and H4B is in the substituent at the C6 position. To control for changes in the C6 substituents, the reconstitution properties of the redox-active MPH4 compared with those of DZPH4 were examined. These compounds both have a 6-methyl group in contrast to the 6-dihydroxypropyl group of H4B. MPH4 has already been shown to reconstitute NOS activity (13Hevel J.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7160-7165Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and, as reported here, reconstituted pterin-free NOS in a time- and thiol-dependent manner, similar to H4B. The higher concentrations of MPH4 (as compared with H4B) required for reconstitution are similar to those needed to support NOS catalysis (13Hevel J.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7160-7165Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). DZPH4, however, is unable to support NOS catalysis (13Hevel J.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7160-7165Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Both compounds, MPH4and DZPH4, are racemic, which may in part explain the observed lowered affinity compared with 6(R)-H4B (25Klatt P. Schmid M. Leopold E. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13861-13866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the 200-fold decrease in the affinity of DZPH4 for NOS may also be due to differences in the pterin side chain. The 6-ethoxymethyl substituent of EtOMeDZPH4results in an even greater decrease (400-fold as compared with H4B) in affinity. The C6 substituent of the pterin thus appears to be an important determinant of binding affinity; this is supported by the multiple interactions of the biopterin side chain with protein residues observed in the NOS structures (21Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 37Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D.

Lundell D.J. Narula S.K. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar).The redox-stable pterin analogs also lack the nitrogen atom at the 5 position, which is present in H4B. The structures of MPH4 and DZPH4 also differ only in the absence of the N5 atom in DZPH4. Therefore, the differences in binding between MPH4 and DZPH4 cannot be attributed to the C6 substituent. DZPH4 lacks a hydrogen bond donor. The mode of DZPH4 binding may be different from that of H4B, particularly in light of the different hydrogen bonding pattern and the difference in reconstitution. Although crystal structures of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin and 4-amino-H4B bound to NOS are indistinguishable from H4B-bound NOS (53Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh S. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4608-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), no structure with a 5-deazapterin bound has been determined. In the structure of the iNOS heme domain dimer (37Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), a hydrogen bond bridges the N5 of H4B (through a water molecule) to Arg-375 of the substrate binding helix, which participates in additional hydrogen bonds. Interestingly, Sono et al. (39Sono M. Ledbetter A.P. McMillan K. Roman L.J. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Dawson J.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15853-15862Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) report that the 4-amino-H4B effects a thiol-dependent shift in the nNOS heme domain Soret. Apparently, the thiol-independent effects of the deazapterins are unique to changes at the N5 position. The absence of this hydrogen bond donor in DZPH4 in addition to the absence of the interactions of a 6-dihydroxypropyl side chain may allow DZPH4 to bind in a different orientation compared with biopterin molecules with a nitrogen at the 5 position. The redox-stable pterin analogs most likely bind near the heme, however, because the analogs affect the heme spin-state equilibrium, and DZPH4 inhibits the pterin-free NOS reaction with NHA and NADPH.Analysis of the zinc, heme, and H4B content of pterin-free and H4B-reconstituted NOS was carried out to further examine the differences between these two forms of the enzyme. However, the presence or absence of H4B made no difference in the binding of heme and zinc by NOS. NOS bound zinc with a highly reproducible stoichiometry of 0.5 per monomer, entirely consistent with the zinc atom bound at the dimer interface of the NOS heme domain (21Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar,38Fischmann T.O. Hruza A. Niu X.D. Fossetta J.D. Lunn C.A. Dolphin E. Prongay A.J. Reichert P. Lundell D.J. Narula S.K. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Zinc content was independent of H4B content and not correlated to the heme stoichiometry. H4B content, when reconstituted, and heme content were equivalent within error in these samples. Heme binds to NOS in the absence of H4B, as evidenced by results with the pterin-free samples. From the stoichiometries observed, it appears that H4B may bind to NOS only when heme is bound.In the absence of reduced thiol, H4B reconstitution as assessed by activity measurements corresponds to ∼50% of the activity recovered in the presence of thiol. As assessed by spectral changes, however, H4B reconstitution in the absence of thiol corresponds to ∼25% of the spectral changes observed in the absence of thiol. The disparity in these two measurements may be explained by 1) the fact that pterin-free NOS is not completely low spin even in the absence of substrate and pterins and 2) that activity measurements must be carried out in the presence of substrate, which may in itself effect an increase in H4B bound (leading to an increase in the base line observed for these experiments). The former results in an underestimation of the extent of H4B binding, and the latter may result in an overestimation of H4B binding. In support of these interpretations, the stoichiometry of H4B bound to pterin-free NOS in the absence of reduced thiol was mea"
https://openalex.org/W2142987382,"During continuous irradiation with near-ultraviolet light (l = 36510 nm; 16 mW/mm(2)) for 2-3 min, live mammalian cells increased reversibly the intensity of one or more peaks of their autofluorescence spectrum from an initial ('ground') level to a two- to threefold higher ('active') level. The effect is characterized by the existence of two states of quantum efficiency and a mechanism of transition that expresses a threshold and a refractory period. It appears that mitochondria are the principal sources of the rising autofluorescence intensity; however, not all mitochondria are capable of expressing it. Studying cells from various organisms that belong to various branches of the phylogenetic tree, we found the rapid increase of autofluorescence only in placental mammalian cells. We speculate that the effect may point to the ability of placental mammalian mitochondria to generate pulsating light signals."

The purpose of this study is to further define transcriptional regulation mechanisms of the distal 5′ flanking region of the rat CCK promoter. We hypothesized that AP-2 and NF-κB would have regulatory effects on CCK transcription. We have evaluated the effect of the transcription inducers forskolin and TPA in transient transfection studies in GH3 rat pituitary tumor cells (41Tashjian A.H. Yasumura Y. Levine L. Sato G.H. Parker M.L. Endocrinology. 1968; 82: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Additionally, we map DNA binding in vitro using DNase I protection studies, as well as mobility shift assays. For these in vitro studies purified nuclear proteins, as well as heterologous nuclear protein extracts, were used. Our results demonstrate that TPA and forskolin regulate transcription of the rat CCK gene in the distal 5′ flanking region. In this region we identified AP-2/NF-κB overlapping recognition sites. We additionally demonstrated a direct interaction between NF-κB and AP-2, which results in inhibition of AP-2 DNA binding. The cloning of the rat CCK 5′ flanking regulatory region (pCCKUER-luc) is as described (13Katsel P.L. Greenstein R.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The 5′ to 3′ direction nested deletions (see Fig. 1) were generated using PCR (upstream oligos were as follows: −244, 5′AGGTGGGGAGGAAGCTGTTTAG 3′; −210, 5′ ACTCATACAAAGTACCCCGCCTG 3′; −170, 5′ TCACTGGGCCGTTTCCCTTC 3′; and −84, 5′ TGCGTCAGCACTGGGTAAACAG 3′, and the downstream oligo was 5′ GGATCTGCCAGCCACTTACC 3′). Linearized pCCKUER (2 ng) was mixed with 1× PCR buffer, 1 unit of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). There were twenty five amplification cycles (denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, primer annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min). PCR-generated fragments were cloned into the polylinker of pBL-luc, which has a Photinus pyralisluciferase reporter gene as described (13Katsel P.L. Greenstein R.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Both strands of all PCR fragments used in this study were sequenced to confirm CCK authenticity and orientation (ABI Prism ABI50; Biotechnology Center, Utah State University, Logan, UT). Sequence analysis was performed using MacVector (Version 5.0; Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems). A series of 3′ to 5′ direction nested deletions were generated using exonuclease III digestion (Erase A Base kit; Promega, Madison, WI) (13Katsel P.L. Greenstein R.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Six constructs were subsequently used in the transient transfection experiments (see Fig. 2).Figure 2TPA and forskolin transcriptional induction in the 5′ flanking region of the rat CCK gene, using “unconventional” 3′ to 5′ deletion. Left panel, a map of the deletion constructs of the fragments used in this study (13Katsel P.L. Greenstein R.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The conventionally accepted cap site has been deleted by 3′ to 5′ exonuclease III digestion. The number on the right of each fragment indicates the number of base pairs deleted 5′ to the cap site. CAP, conventionally accepted transcription initiation site (4Vanderhaegen J.J. Signeau J.C. Gepts W. Nature. 1975; 257: 604-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar).

Right panel, pCCKUER-luc and each of the four nested deletions were transiently transfected in GH3 cells. Values were normalized to CCKUER, which has been arbitrarily assigned the value of 100. Error bars represent S.E.; n = 7 from each experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) GH3 rat pituitary tumor cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured and transfected using Lipofectin® (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (13Katsel P.L. Greenstein R.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Two transcriptional enhancers were evaluated, forskolin and TPA (both from Sigma). Samples were reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide and further diluted in sterile water (molecular biology grade; Whittaker, Walkersville, MD) to a final concentration of 10 μm. Fresh solutions of these transcriptional enhancers were prepared for each transfection. Aqueous solutions (5 μl) of 10 μm solutions of phorbol ester and/or forskolin were added to the medium following 6 h of transfection. In preliminary studies we determined that 100 nm forskolin, as well as TPA, was the optimal concentration (data not presented). 12 h later cells were harvested, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activity as described (13Katsel P.L. Greenstein R.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). To compare data from different experiments, values were normalized to intact CCKUER, arbitrarily assigned the value of 100. Data is presented as mean ± S.E. DNase protection assays were performed as described (13Katsel P.L. Greenstein R.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The only variation was the final binding buffer for the NF-κB experiments (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40). The transcription factors studied were AP-2, as well as NF-κB (p50 subunit) (all from Promega, Madison, WI). The digestion products were analyzed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The markers are sequenced single-stranded M13mp18 bacteriophage (T7 Sequenase, Version 2.0, DNA sequence kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PCR-site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described (42Juncosa-Ginesta M. Pons J. Planas A. Querol E. Biotechniques. 1994; 16: 820-823PubMed Google Scholar). This particular method of mutagenesis requires two sequential PCR reactions. The upstream primer is mutagenic for the AP-2 recognition site (5′ CCTTCTATCCTCGGATCCACTTCGATCGG 3′). The downstream primer recognizes a sequence from the luciferase reporter (5′ ATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCCA 3′). First step PCR with Deep Vent (exo−) DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) has thirty amplification cycles. Denaturation was at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing was at 65 °C for 1 min, and extension was at 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were mixed with SYBRTM Green I (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and loaded into 1% agarose gel. The resulting band (327 bp) was purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Isolated fragment was then used as the mutagenic primer in the second PCR reaction, where it was mixed with the 20-mer forward primer (20 pmol, 5′ TCACTGCATTCTAGTTGTGG 3′). The conditions in the second PCR reaction were identical to those used in the first. The resulting PCR product was religated into pBL-luc. Mutated plasmids contained an additional BamHI restriction site, which had been introduced by the mutagenesis. Successful mutagenesis and the correct orientation were confirmed by restriction digest mapping, as well as by DNA sequencing (Biotechnology Center, Utah State University, Logan, UT). The fragment to be radiolabeled was PCR-generated using linearized pCCKUER as a template with primers (5′ TCACTGGGCCGTTTCCCTTC 3′ and 5′ AGTCATCTGTTTACCCAGTGCTGAC 3′). Obtained fragment (113 bp) was than dephosphorylated using calf intestine phosphatase (Promega, Madison, WI). The termini of this fragment were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI). Labeled, double-stranded DNA (50,000 cpm, 0.01 pmol) was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Titrations were performed with increasing amounts of HeLa cell nuclear extract (see Fig. 5, panel A), AP-2 protein extract (see Fig. 5, panel B), or NF-κB (p50) protein (see Fig. 6). Following incubation, samples were mixed with loading buffer and analyzed on a 4% (80:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × Tris borate, EDTA. The resulting gel was dried prior to autoradiography. Following exposure, the bands of interest were excised and quantified in a scintillation counter (Beckman LS 7000).Figure 6Mutations in the AP-2/NF-κB consensus recognition sequence reduces binding by NF-κB (p50). The 113-bp fragments CCK, −170 to −57 (three lanes on the left), and the mutated ΔCCK, −170 to −57 (three lanes on the right), were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and incubated with increasing amounts (0.13 and 0.26 μg) of NF-κB (p50) protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effect of TPA and forskolin were evaluated both independently and in combination. We used the full-length CCKUER (473 bp), as well as four 5′ to 3′ direction deletions of the 5′ flanking region of the rat CCK gene (Fig. 1, left panel). These constructs were then stimulated with TPA and forskolin (Fig. 1,right panel). Both TPA and forskolin enhance CCKUER-luc expression. Deletion to −170 results in loss of forskolin-induced expression. By contrast, TPA-induced expression is maintained until deletion proceeds to −84. Thus, these data identify a TPA-activated transcription factor-responsive element between −84 and −170 bp. Alternatively, we evaluated the effect of TPA and forskolin treatment of transfected GH3 cells for a series of 3′ to 5′ nested deletions (Fig. 2, left panel). In our preliminary studies we have determined that by removing the dominant signal generated at the conventional transcription initiation site as a result of 3′ to 5′ direction of deletion, the rate of basal transcription would be significantly declined resulting in decrease of luciferase signal (13Katsel P.L. Greenstein R.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). This enabled us to isolate the effect of more distal 5′ regulatory elements associated with upstream alternative start sites of the rat CCK gene. Both TPA and forskolin induced expression until CCKUER was deleted to −130 (Fig. 2, right panel, lanes −50 and −130). When the next 10 bp were deleted TPA induction was lost (Fig. 2, right panel, lane −140). In contrast, the same deletion construct (−140) still exhibits forskolin-induced expression. Thus, these data identify a TPA-activated transcription factor-responsive element between −130 and −140 bp of the 5′ flanking region of the rat CCK gene. We next evaluated, in combination, the effect of TPA and forskolin on the series of 3′ to 5′ nested deletions (Fig.3). Individually both TPA and forskolin induce CCKUER. By contrast, combination of TPA and forskolin reduces CCKUER expression to a baseline level. This combined TPA/forskolin inhibition is maintained for the first two deletion constructs studied (CCK −50 and CCK −130). However, when deletion proceeds an additional 10 bp, to CCK −140, the inhibition was lost, and signal increased up to 3-fold. Forskolin, but not TPA, remains active at CCK −140 when deletion proceeds to −140 (Fig. 2). These data corroborate our initial observation that there is a major site of transcriptional regulation in the −130 to −140 region of the 5′ flanking region of the rat CCK gene. Sequence analysis suggests AP-2, as well as NF-κB, binding sites in this region of −130 to −140 (see Fig. 9). Accordingly, DNase protection assays with purified AP-2 and NF-κB transcription factors were performed (Fig. 4). Purified AP-2 protects the coding strand in two regions, between −37 and −48 and between −139 and −149. Purified NF-κB (p50) protects the coding strand between −134 and −145. Thus, both NF-κB and AP-2 bind in the sequence between −130 and −140 of the 5′ flanking region of the rat CCK gene, which is regulated by TPA and forskolin stimulation (Figs. 2and 3).Figure 4Binding AP2 and NF-κB to the 5′ flanking region of the rat CCK gene. Single end-labeled DNA fragments from the coding strand of the 400-bp 5′ flanking region of the rat CCK gene were combined with purified AP2 or NF-κB (p50) proteins either alone as described (0, 1, or 2 footprint units as indicated) or in combination (MIX = 1:1 footprint units as indicated). Limited DNase I digestion was followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Binding to this −130 to −140 region was then evaluated in a mobility shift assay. HeLa cell nuclear extract, which contains AP-2, was used. As the HeLa cell nuclear extract amount is increased there is linear increase in signal (Fig. 5, panel A, lanes 5, 10, and 20). Next a competitive inhibition study was performed using 1- and 10-fold molar excess of “cold” wild type CCK fragment between −57 and −170 (Fig. 5, panel A, lanes 5 and 6 from the left). As the amount of cold CCK is increased, the radiolabeled signal band (cpm) decreases by 70% (data not presented). This indicates competition by the wild type CCK for the fraction of the HeLa cell nuclear extract, which binds to the radiolabeled fragment of CCK. The same experiment was then repeated using the unlabeled 113-bp mutated (Δ) CCK fragment between −57 and −170 (Fig. 5, panel A, lanes 7 and 8 from the left). There were six bp mutations introduced in the AP-2 consensus recognition sequence located between −130 and −140 (see “Materials and Methods”). These mutations result in only 7% decrease in binding (cpm data not presented). This competitive inhibition by the wild type cold CCK demonstrates the specificity of the interaction between HeLa cell nuclear extract and AP-2 cis-element on the CCK gene. Thus, these data identify the binding of the HeLa cell nuclear extract to the 5′ flanking region of the rat CCK gene, which contains both the AP-2 cis-element located between −138 and −149 and the NF-κB cis-element between −134 and −145. Purified AP-2 and NF-κB (p50) bind, with a linear titration, to the same CCK region (Fig. 5, panel Band Fig. 6, lanes 2 and 3 from the left). In contrast, there is negligible NF-κB (p50) binding of the mutated ΔCCK −170 to −57 (Fig. 6, lanes 4 and 5 from the left). These data indicate that six-point mutation in the sequence between −140 and −149 of the 5′ flanking region of the rat CCK gene prevents binding of NF-κB protein. A mobility shift assay was performed using both AP-2 and NF-κB individually, as well as in combination (Fig.7). There is a linear increase in binding for both transcription factors when studied individually (Fig. 7,lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6 from the left). However, when both proteins are studied in combination, the AP-2·DNA complex, previously identified, is completely lost (Fig. 7, center lane, see arrow on the right, indicating AP-2·DNA complex migration). These data show an AP-2/NF-κB interaction, which interferes with AP-2·CCK promoter complexing. Cell culture was then used to investigate the functional significance of the region between −134 and −149. When this region is mutated, the CCK promoter loses its capacity to be induced by either TPA or forskolin (Fig. 8). These data confirm the functional significance of this region in the binding of nuclear proteins activated by both TPA and forskolin. Thus, the inhibition of combined TPA and forskolin is mediated within the region between −130 and −140 bp 5′ to the cap site. This region contains, in part, AP-2 and NF-κB (p50) consensus recognition sequences (see Fig. 4). In this study we identify hitherto undescribed transcription regulatory sites in the 5′ flanking region of the rat CCK gene. The region of most interest in this study was a 10-bp sequence located between −130 and −140. In the course of this study we demonstrate that this region is responsive to both TPA and forskolin. In addition, we determine the complex relationship between these two transcription enhancers in the same region of CCK promoter. Four from six previously described 3′to 5′ direction deletion constructs (13Katsel P.L. Greenstein R.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) were utilized in this study (Fig. 2). We additionally generated four constructs, which were deleted in the more conventional 5′ to 3′ direction (Fig. 1). Mutational analysis was performed using six bp mutations, which were inserted between −130 and −140. These constructs permitted a more detailed evaluation of the TPA- and forskolin-responsive regions, which had been identified during the course of the study. Deleted, as well as mutated, constructs were transiently transfected into GH3 cells. We had previously used GH3 (rat pituitary tumor) cells in our studies with CCK (13Katsel P.L. Greenstein R.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). GH3 cells produce neither endogenous CCK mRNA nor any CCK peptides. However, GH3 cells self-evidently have the transcriptional mechanisms that induce transcription of the 5′ flanking region of the rat CCK gene in the transient transfection studies that we performed. The data from cell culture show complex transcriptional regulation of the 5′ flanking region of the rat CCK gene as a result of TPA and forskolin treatment (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and Fig. 8). However, pathways of TPA and forskolin action remain to be fully defined in GH3 cells. In this study, in addition to the role of TPA and forskolin, we show that two transcription factors have overlapping recognition sites in the 17-bp region located between −134 and −149. These two factors are AP-2 and NF-κB. We speculate that in GH3 cells forskolin induction of AP-2 may well occur. Preliminary data determine AP-2 expression of in GH3 cells (data not presented). The unconventional 3′ to 5′ direction of deletion, which we use, shows that when deletion proceeds to −140, forskolin, but not TPA, is still stimulatory (Fig. 2). In contrast, the conventional 5′ to 3′ deletion constructs support that TPA is still stimulatory in the fragment that contains this −134 to −149 region, and forskolin induction is lost between −170 and −210 (Fig. 1). The deletion construct (−170) contains the AP-2/NF-κB binding sites identified in this study. A possible explanation for this paradox may lie in the presence of other forskolin-responsive elements associated with alternative initiation sites (13Katsel P.L. Greenstein R.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) in the distal region of CCK promoter. These elements are deleted as a result of 5′to 3′ deletion but are still present in the 3′ to 5′ deletion constructs. Our preliminary data indicate, for example, previously unreported AP-1 binding sequences, which we identify between −354 and −387 (data not presented). As a consequence of our data, we hypothesize that forskolin may activate binding to the identified AP-2, as well as some other distal responsive elements, possibly, including the distal AP-1 site in GH3 cells. This hypothesis will be determined in subsequent study. There is inter-species sequence conservation in the proximal 5′ flanking region of CCK genes. The first 100 bp 5′ to the conventionally accepted transcription initiation site in rat (10Deschenes R.J. Lorenz L.J. Haun R.S. Roos B.A. Collier K.J. Dixon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Vashishtha A. Linzer E. Powell D.J. Friedman J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and man (16Nielsen F.C. Pedersen K. Hansen T.V.O. Rourke I.J. Rehfeld J.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have 80% homology. Sp1 consensus recognition sequence has been described in the human CCK promoter between −37 and −48 (16Nielsen F.C. Pedersen K. Hansen T.V.O. Rourke I.J. Rehfeld J.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the rat gene, we were unable to demonstrate SP1 binding to this sequence (data not presented). However, we have demonstrated that AP-2 binds in a homologous sequence (−37 to −48) in the 5′ flanking region of rat CCK gene (Fig. 4). In the more distal 5′ flanking regulatory region of rat, mouse, and man CCK DNA sequence homology falls to ∼40%. In this study we identify an AP-2/NF-κB binding site in the rat (−134 to −149). By contrast, we find no analogous AP-2/NF-κB binding region in a sequence analysis of the 5′ flanking region of man or mouse. A similar 17-bp sequence in mouse CCK gene (11Vitale M. Vashishtha A. Linzer E. Powell D.J. Friedman J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) contains 3-bp mismatches and a 4-bp mismatches in the human CCK gene (16Nielsen F.C. Pedersen K. Hansen T.V.O. Rourke I.J. Rehfeld J.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These data imply that the proximal 5′ flanking region is of more significance in basal CCK transcription. The distal upstream 5′ flanking regulatory region may be of greater relevance in species-specific regulation of CCK transcription. Both the human, as well as the rat, CCK promoter have a highly conserved cAMP-responsive element/TPA-responsive element binding region (−79 and −87) (16Nielsen F.C. Pedersen K. Hansen T.V.O. Rourke I.J. Rehfeld J.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Haun R.S. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15455-15463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A three-point mutation within this site eliminates transcriptional activation by both TPA and forskolin (16Nielsen F.C. Pedersen K. Hansen T.V.O. Rourke I.J. Rehfeld J.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We confirm a homologous region in the rat gene (−79 and −87) (Fig. 9) and an additional (−42 to −46), which is protected from DNase I digestion by AP-1 (data not presented). Our data indicate a complex inhibition of transcription by TPA and forskolin (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and Fig. 8). We additionally show that in this region of inhibition are overlapped responsive elements of AP-2 and NF-κB, characterized by complex negative interaction of each other (Fig. 7). NF-κB and a glucocorticoid receptor mutually inhibit transcriptional activation (38Auphan N. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar, 39Wissink S. van Heerde E.C. Schmitz M.L. Kalkhoven E. van der Burg B. Baeuerle P.A. van der Saag P.T. J. Biol.

However, to our knowledge, these data are the first that demonstrate transcriptional inhibition involving NF-κB and AP-2. Studies of the mechanism involved in the interactions by which inhibition of these nuclear factors is mediated should be addressed in the future."
