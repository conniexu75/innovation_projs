https://openalex.org/W2010653277,"Hidden cell sub-populations are detected by accounting for confounding variation inthe analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. Recent technical developments have enabled the transcriptomes of hundreds of cells to be assayed in an unbiased manner, opening up the possibility that new subpopulations of cells can be found. However, the effects of potential confounding factors, such as the cell cycle, on the heterogeneity of gene expression and therefore on the ability to robustly identify subpopulations remain unclear. We present and validate a computational approach that uses latent variable models to account for such hidden factors. We show that our single-cell latent variable model (scLVM) allows the identification of otherwise undetectable subpopulations of cells that correspond to different stages during the differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 2 cells. Our approach can be used not only to identify cellular subpopulations but also to tease apart different sources of gene expression heterogeneity in single-cell transcriptomes."

https://openalex.org/W1969571661,"We report a large multicenter genome-wide association study of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin, the frontline antimalarial drug. Across 15 locations in Southeast Asia, we identified at least 20 mutations in kelch13 (PF3D7_1343700) affecting the encoded propeller and BTB/POZ domains, which were associated with a slow parasite clearance rate after treatment with artemisinin derivatives. Nonsynonymous polymorphisms in fd (ferredoxin), arps10 (apicoplast ribosomal protein S10), mdr2 (multidrug resistance protein 2) and crt (chloroquine resistance transporter) also showed strong associations with artemisinin resistance. Analysis of the fine structure of the parasite population showed that the fd, arps10, mdr2 and crt polymorphisms are markers of a genetic background on which kelch13 mutations are particularly likely to arise and that they correlate with the contemporary geographical boundaries and population frequencies of artemisinin resistance. These findings indicate that the risk of new resistance-causing mutations emerging is determined by specific predisposing genetic factors in the underlying parasite population."

Mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 proteins alter the epigenetic landscape in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells through production of the oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Here we performed a large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify genes that are synthetic lethal to the IDH1R132H mutation in AML and identified the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-2. IDH1- and IDH2-mutant primary human AML cells were more sensitive than IDH1/2 wild-type cells to ABT-199, a highly specific BCL-2 inhibitor that is currently in clinical trials for hematologic malignancies, both ex vivo and in xenotransplant models. This sensitization effect was induced by (R)-2-HGâ€“mediated inhibition of the activity of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC); suppression of COX activity lowered the mitochondrial threshold to trigger apoptosis upon BCL-2 inhibition. Our findings indicate that IDH1/2 mutation status may identify patients that are likely to respond to pharmacologic BCL-2 inhibition and form the rational basis for combining agents that disrupt ETC activity with ABT-199 in future clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W2076546992,"A method to measure the precise relationship between neuronal firing rates and the representation of accumulated evidence is described; results in the parietal and prefrontal cortex of rats, together with transient optogenetic inactivation of the prefrontal cortex, challenge the prevailing view that the prefrontal cortex is part of the neural circuit for accumulating evidence, and suggest that neurons in parietal and prefrontal areas have distinct relationships to evidence accumulation in decision-making. Previous work in nonhuman primates has documented neural correlates of accumulating evidence for decision-making in a variety of brain regions, primarily in the posterior parietal cortex and the frontal eye fields in the prefrontal cortex. Carlos Brody and colleagues test these observations in rats trained to perform an auditory evidence-accumulation decision task, and develop a method to measure the precise relationship between neuronal firing rates and representation of evidence. Their results challenge the prevailing view that the prefrontal cortex is part of the neural circuit for accumulating evidence and suggest that neurons in parietal and prefrontal areas have distinct relationships during decision-making. Gradual accumulation of evidence is thought to be fundamental for decision-making, and its neural correlates have been found in several brain regions1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Here we develop a generalizable method to measure tuning curves that specify the relationship between neural responses and mentally accumulated evidence, and apply it to distinguish the encoding of decision variables in posterior parietal cortex and prefrontal cortex (frontal orienting fields, FOF). We recorded the firing rates of neurons in posterior parietal cortex and FOF from rats performing a perceptual decision-making task. Classical analyses uncovered correlates of accumulating evidence, similar to previous observations in primates and also similar across the two regions. However, tuning curve assays revealed that while the posterior parietal cortex encodes a graded value of the accumulating evidence, the FOF has a more categorical encoding that indicates, throughout the trial, the decision provisionally favoured by the evidence accumulated so far. Contrary to current views3,5,7,8,9, this suggests that premotor activity in the frontal cortex does not have a role in the accumulation process, but instead has a more categorical function, such as transforming accumulated evidence into a discrete choice. To probe causally the role of FOF activity, we optogenetically silenced it during different time points of the trial. Consistent with a role in committing to a categorical choice at the end of the evidence accumulation process, but not consistent with a role during the accumulation itself, a behavioural effect was observed only when FOF silencing occurred at the end of the perceptual stimulus. Our results place important constraints on the circuit logic of brain regions involved in decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W2026547100,"Fukazawa et al. report that SIV persists in follicular helper T cells in elite controller macaques, evading clearance by CD8+ T cells Chronic-phase HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication is reduced by as much as 10,000-fold in elite controllers (ECs) compared with typical progressors (TPs), but sufficient viral replication persists in EC tissues to allow viral sequence evolution and induce excess immune activation. Here we show that productive SIV infection in rhesus monkey ECs, but not TPs, is markedly restricted to CD4+ follicular helper T (TFH) cells, suggesting that these EC monkeys' highly effective SIV-specific CD8+ T cells can effectively clear productive SIV infection from extrafollicular sites, but their relative exclusion from B cell follicles prevents their elimination of productively infected TFH cells. CD8+ lymphocyte depletion in EC monkeys resulted in a dramatic re-distribution of productive SIV infection to non-TFH cells, with restriction of productive infection to TFH cells resuming upon CD8+ T cell recovery. Thus, B cell follicles constitute 'sanctuaries' for persistent SIV replication in the presence of potent anti-viral CD8+ T cell responses, potentially complicating efforts to cure HIV infection with therapeutic vaccination or T cell immunotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W2029054948,"Stem cells undergo a shift in metabolic substrate utilization during specification and/or differentiation, a process that has been termed metabolic reprogramming. Here, we report that during the transition from quiescence to proliferation, skeletal muscle stem cells experience a metabolic switch from fatty acid oxidation to glycolysis. This reprogramming of cellular metabolism decreases intracellular NAD(+) levels and the activity of the histone deacetylase SIRT1, leading to elevated H4K16 acetylation and activation of muscle gene transcription. Selective genetic ablation of the SIRT1 deacetylase domain in skeletal muscle results in increased H4K16 acetylation and deregulated activation of the myogenic program in SCs. Moreover, mice with muscle-specific inactivation of the SIRT1 deacetylase domain display reduced myofiber size, impaired muscle regeneration, and derepression of muscle developmental genes. Overall, these findings reveal how metabolic cues can be mechanistically translated into epigenetic modifications that regulate skeletal muscle stem cell biology."
https://openalex.org/W2011637823,"Single-cell genomics and single-cell transcriptomics have emerged as powerful tools to study the biology of single cells at a genome-wide scale. However, a major challenge is to sequence both genomic DNA and mRNA from the same cell, which would allow direct comparison of genomic variation and transcriptome heterogeneity. We describe a quasilinear amplification strategy to quantify genomic DNA and mRNA from the same cell without physically separating the nucleic acids before amplification. We show that the efficiency of our integrated approach is similar to existing methods for single-cell sequencing of either genomic DNA or mRNA. Further, we find that genes with high cell-to-cell variability in transcript numbers generally have lower genomic copy numbers, and vice versa, suggesting that copy number variations may drive variability in gene expression among individual cells. Applications of our integrated sequencing approach could range from gaining insights into cancer evolution and heterogeneity to understanding the transcriptional consequences of copy number variations in healthy and diseased tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1968714114,"Inhibiting projections from the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus to a specific division of the amygdala prevents fear conditioning in mice, indicating an important role for the thalamusâ€“amygdala circuit in establishing and maintaining fear responses. Fear association memories are thought to be stored in the amygdala and are accessible throughout the lifetime of an animal. However, the circuits required for retrieval of this memory at different times are still unknown. Recent work revealed that the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) is strongly activated following physical and psychological stress in mice, and now two papers published in this week's issue of Nature demonstrate a role for the PVT as a critical memory/retrieval node in the thalamus during the transition from short-term to long-term storage of fear association memories. Mario Penzo et al. show that inhibiting projections from the PVT to a specific division of the amygdala prevented fear conditioning via disruption of the typical fear-induced synaptic potentiation on a specific subset of interneurons found in the amygdala following behavioural fear training. Fabricio Do-Monte et al. dissociate early from late retrieval time points and demonstrate that while the PVT is critical for late-time-point fear-memory retrieval, a separate circuit originating from the prelimbic prefrontal cortex and projecting to the amygdala is critical only for early-time-point retrieval. Appropriate responses to an imminent threat brace us for adversities. The ability to sense and predict threatening or stressful events is essential for such adaptive behaviour. In the mammalian brain, one putative stress sensor is the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), an area that is readily activated by both physical and psychological stressors1,2,3. However, the role of the PVT in the establishment of adaptive behavioural responses remains unclear. Here we show in mice that the PVT regulates fear processing in the lateral division of the central amygdala (CeL), a structure that orchestrates fear learning and expression4,5. Selective inactivation of CeL-projecting PVT neurons prevented fear conditioning, an effect that can be accounted for by an impairment in fear-conditioning-induced synaptic potentiation onto somatostatin-expressing (SOM+) CeL neurons, which has previously been shown to store fear memory6. Consistently, we found that PVT neurons preferentially innervate SOM+ neurons in the CeL, and stimulation of PVT afferents facilitated SOM+ neuron activity and promoted intra-CeL inhibition, two processes that are critical for fear learning and expression5,6. Notably, PVT modulation of SOM+ CeL neurons was mediated by activation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptor tropomysin-related kinase B (TrkB). As a result, selective deletion of either Bdnf in the PVT or Trkb in SOM+ CeL neurons impaired fear conditioning, while infusion of BDNF into the CeL enhanced fear learning and elicited unconditioned fear responses. Our results demonstrate that the PVTâ€“CeL pathway constitutes a novel circuit essential for both the establishment of fear memory and the expression of fear responses, and uncover mechanisms linking stress detection in PVT with the emergence of adaptive behaviour."

https://openalex.org/W1972768039,"Dissociating early from late fear memory retrieval in rats reveals that while the projection from the prelimbic prefrontal cortex to the amygdala is critical for fear memory retrieval at early time points, a separate circuit involving the paraventricular region of the dorsal midline thalamus is critical for fear memory retrieval at late time points, establishing the paraventricular region as a critical maintenance/retrieval node during the transition from short- to long-term fear memory. Fear association memories are thought to be stored in the amygdala and are accessible throughout the lifetime of an animal. However, the circuits required for retrieval of this memory at different times are still unknown.

Fear memories allow animals to avoid danger, thereby increasing their chances of survival. Fear memories can be retrieved long after learning1,2, but little is known about how retrieval circuits change with time3,4. Here we show that the dorsal midline thalamus of rats is required for the retrieval of auditory conditioned fear at late (24 hours, 7 days, 28 days), but not early (0.5 hours, 6 hours) time points after learning. Consistent with this, the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), a subregion of the dorsal midline thalamus, showed increased c-Fos expression only at late time points, indicating that the PVT is gradually recruited for fear retrieval. Accordingly, the conditioned tone responses of PVT neurons increased with time after training. The prelimbic (PL) prefrontal cortex, which is necessary for fear retrieval5,6,7, sends dense projections to the PVT8. Retrieval at late time points activated PL neurons projecting to the PVT, and optogenetic silencing of these projections impaired retrieval at late, but not early, time points. In contrast, silencing of PL inputs to the basolateral amygdala impaired retrieval at early, but not late, time points, indicating a time-dependent shift in retrieval circuits. Retrieval at late time points also activated PVT neurons projecting to the central nucleus of the amygdala, and silencing these projections at late, but not early, time points induced a persistent attenuation of fear. Thus, the PVT may act as a crucial thalamic node recruited into cortico-amygdalar networks for retrieval and maintenance of long-term fear memories."

https://openalex.org/W1965265512,"Colorectal cancer primarily metastasizes to the liver and globally kills over 600,000 people annually. By functionally screening 661 microRNAs (miRNAs) in parallel during liver colonization, we have identified miR-551a and miR-483 as robust endogenous suppressors of liver colonization and metastasis. These miRNAs convergently target creatine kinase, brain-type (CKB), which phosphorylates the metabolite creatine, to generate phosphocreatine. CKB is released into the extracellular space by metastatic cells encountering hepatic hypoxia and catalyzes production of phosphocreatine, which is imported through the SLC6A8 transporter and used to generate ATPâ€”fueling metastatic survival. Combinatorial therapeutic viral delivery of miR-551a and miR-483-5p through single-dose adeno-associated viral (AAV) delivery significantly suppressed colon cancer metastasis, as did CKB inhibition with a small-molecule inhibitor. Importantly, human liver metastases express higher CKB and SLC6A8 levels and reduced miR-551a/miR-483 levels relative to primary tumors. We identify the extracellular space as an important compartment for malignant energetic catalysis and therapeutic targeting.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIzODk1Mzk1Njg0MmVhNzYzNjc4Njc5N2U2MmI5NjgxOSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4NDExNTUwfQ.N-nDZxTw7-__rWzZWMZy8TPD2VLREVELDLTgW08uUn7cz0VnyTrL77EZe8L285GH24Cbnzyj599-9e0rtvnhLTHQJEftE8SNxKLWDD73wnfi2FlfxceoIAyrJ5zWakJzb5wXTjOvQueb1sZlA28mMaZv-VhaJqOOc1BylH7SrcFVh-5jMG0r9jX0kwdsODxYvNN4MEtM1vPdLQ_y4Nn98XkQo850i1Bte8DA8v2BnbdWWjdgHk5oltwDzsPtA4uteKwiykxAGTD60rxgBtSA0-o7F6VcFF0V-T9rslGVRSDI3VC7dW4tos9NEojKjiYILsoTmoE8jh1tcqSSJuSyOA(mp4, (67.53 MB) Download video"

https://openalex.org/W2106306904,"We describe a new computational method for estimating the probability that a point mutation at each position in a genome will influence fitness. These 'fitness consequence' (fitCons) scores serve as evolution-based measures of potential genomic function. Our approach is to cluster genomic positions into groups exhibiting distinct 'fingerprints' on the basis of high-throughput functional genomic data, then to estimate a probability of fitness consequences for each group from associated patterns of genetic polymorphism and divergence. We have generated fitCons scores for three human cell types on the basis of public data from ENCODE. In comparison with conventional conservation scores, fitCons scores show considerably improved prediction power for cis regulatory elements. In addition, fitCons scores indicate that 4.2-7.5% of nucleotides in the human genome have influenced fitness since the human-chimpanzee divergence, and they suggest that recent evolutionary turnover has had limited impact on the functional content of the genome."
https://openalex.org/W1992149698,"The regulated release of anorexigenic Î±-melanocyte stimulating hormone (Î±-MSH) and orexigenic Agouti-related protein (AgRP) from discrete hypothalamic arcuate neurons onto common target sites in the central nervous system has a fundamental role in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Both peptides bind with high affinity to the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R); existing data show that Î±-MSH is an agonist that couples the receptor to the GÎ±s signalling pathway, while AgRP binds competitively to block Î±-MSH binding and blocks the constitutive activity mediated by the ligand-mimetic amino-terminal domain of the receptor. Here we show that, in mice, regulation of firing activity of neurons from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) by Î±-MSH and AgRP can be mediated independently of GÎ±s signalling by ligand-induced coupling of MC4R to closure of inwardly rectifying potassium channel, Kir7.1. Furthermore, AgRP is a biased agonist that hyperpolarizes neurons by binding to MC4R and opening Kir7.1, independently of its inhibition of Î±-MSH binding. Consequently, Kir7.1 signalling appears to be central to melanocortin-mediated regulation of energy homeostasis within the PVN. Coupling of MC4R to Kir7.1 may explain unusual aspects of the control of energy homeostasis by melanocortin signalling, including the gene dosage effect of MC4R and the sustained effects of AgRP on food intake."
https://openalex.org/W2020303151,"Primary cilia are required for vertebrate cells to respond to specific intercellular signals. Here we define when and where primary cilia appear in the mouse embryo using a transgenic line that expresses ARL13B-mCherry in cilia and Centrin 2-GFP in centrosomes. Primary cilia first appear on cells of the epiblast at E6.0 and are subsequently present on all derivatives of the epiblast. In contrast, extraembryonic cells of the visceral endoderm and trophectoderm lineages have centrosomes but no cilia. Stem cell lines derived from embryonic lineages recapitulate the in vivo pattern: epiblast stem cells are ciliated, whereas trophoblast stem cells and extraembryonic endoderm (XEN) stem cells lack cilia. Basal bodies in XEN cells are mature and can form cilia when the AURKA-HDAC6 cilium disassembly pathway is inhibited. The lineage-dependent distribution of cilia is stable throughout much of gestation, defining which cells in the placenta and yolk sac are able to respond to Hedgehog ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2030982446,"Viable yet damaged cells can accumulate during development and aging. Although eliminating those cells may benefit organ function, identification of this less fit cell population remains challenging. Previously, we identified a molecular mechanism, based on ""fitness fingerprints"" displayed on cell membranes, which allows direct fitness comparison among cells in Drosophila. Here, we study the physiological consequences of efficient cell selection for the whole organism. We find that fitness-based cell culling is naturally used to maintain tissue health, delay aging, and extend lifespan in Drosophila. We identify a gene, azot, which ensures the elimination of less fit cells. Lack of azot increases morphological malformations and susceptibility to random mutations and accelerates tissue degeneration. On the contrary, improving the efficiency of cell selection is beneficial for tissue health and extends lifespan."
https://openalex.org/W2041848357,"Development of a segmented filamentous bacteria and host cell co-culturing system that supports filamentation, segmentation, and differentiation to release viable infectious intracellular offspring. The gut microbiota is important for maturation of the host's mucosal immune system. In particular, the species commonly referred to as segmented filamentous bacterium (SFB) is unique in being able to stimulate maturation of the B and T cell compartments and induce T helper 17 (Th17) cell responses in the intestine. However, little is known about hostâ€“SFB interaction as attempts to culture the bacterium in vitro have been unsuccessful for more than 50 years. Now Philippe Sansonetti and colleagues have developed an SFBâ€“host cell co-culturing system which they use to support filamentation, segmentation and differentiation to release viable infectious particles. These offspring can colonize mice and induce the signature immune response, meaning that the new culture system will rapidly accelerate our understanding of these important symbionts and their interaction with their host. The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the maturation of the intestinal mucosal immune system of its host1,2. Within the thousand bacterial species present in the intestine, the symbiont segmented filamentous bacterium (SFB) is unique in its ability to potently stimulate the post-natal maturation of the B- and T-cell compartments and induce a striking increase in the small-intestinal Th17 responses3,4,5. Unlike other commensals, SFB intimately attaches to absorptive epithelial cells in the ileum and cells overlying Peyerâ€™s patches6,7. This colonization does not result in pathology; rather, it protects the host from pathogens4. Yet, little is known about the SFBâ€“host interaction that underlies the important immunostimulatory properties of SFB, because SFB have resisted in vitro culturing for more than 50 years. Here we grow mouse SFB outside their host in an SFBâ€“host cell co-culturing system. Single-celled SFB isolated from monocolonized mice undergo filamentation, segmentation, and differentiation to release viable infectious particles, the intracellular offspring, which can colonize mice to induce signature immune responses. In vitro, intracellular offspring can attach to mouse and human host cells and recruit actin. In addition, SFB can potently stimulate the upregulation of host innate defence genes, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines. In vitro culturing thereby mimics the in vivo niche, provides new insights into SFB growth requirements and their immunostimulatory potential, and makes possible the investigation of the complex developmental stages of SFB and the detailed dissection of the unique SFBâ€“host interaction at the cellular and molecular levels."

Although such waves have been studied for decades, little is known about their function. Here we show that traveling waves in the primate extrastriate visual cortex provide a means of integrating sensory and motor signals. Specifically, we describe a traveling wave of local field potential (LFP) activity in cortical area V4 of macaque monkeys that is triggered by the execution of saccadic eye movements. These waves sweep across the V4 retinotopic map, following a consistent path from the foveal to the peripheral representations of space; their amplitudes correlate with the direction and size of each saccade. Moreover, these waves are associated with a reorganization of the postsaccadic neuronal firing patterns, which follow a similar retinotopic progression, potentially prioritizing the processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli."

In the present study, we found that the expression level of miR-637 was significantly reduced in clinical glioma tissues compared with normal brain tissues. Moreover, we revealed that the introduction of miR-637 dramatically suppressed glioma cell growth, migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Further studies revealed that Akt1 is a direct target gene of miR-637. Silencing of Akt1 inhibited the growth and invasion of glioma cells by decreasing phosphorylated Akt, Î²-catenin, phosphorylated Foxo1 and Cyclin D1 and inducing the expression of Foxo1, which was consistent with the effect of miR-637 overexpression. Suppressed expression of miR-637 and increased Akt1 protein levels were correlated with unfavorable progression and poor prognosis, respectively, and a negative relationship between the miR-637 expression and Akt1 protein levels was observed in gliomas. Our findings provide new insights into the role of miR-637 in the development of gliomas, and implicate the potential application of miR-637 in cancer therapy."

We have discovered a previously unknown role of a post-translational modification termed adenylylation/AMPylation in regulating signal transduction events during UPR induction. A family of enzymes, defined by the presence of a Fic (filamentation induced by cAMP) domain, catalyzes this adenylylation reaction. The human genome encodes a single Fic protein, called HYPE (Huntingtin yeast interacting protein E), with adenylyltransferase activity but unknown physiological target(s). Here, we demonstrate that HYPE localizes to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum via its hydrophobic N terminus and adenylylates the ER molecular chaperone, BiP, at Ser-365 and Thr-366. BiP functions as a sentinel for protein misfolding and maintains ER homeostasis. We found that adenylylation enhances BiP's ATPase activity, which is required for refolding misfolded proteins while coping with ER stress. Accordingly, HYPE expression levels increase upon stress. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of HYPE prevents the induction of an unfolded protein response.

When there is an imbalance between the rate of unfolded proteins entering the ER and the rate of protein folding by ER chaperones, ER stress is induced. Under such a condition, the ER activates an unfolded protein response (UPR), mediated by the following three ER transmembrane receptors: inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6). and protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) (1.Bernales S.

Fic proteins are defined by an HXFX(D/E)(G/A)N(G/K)RXXR motif, with the invariant His being required for enzymatic activity (3.Cruz J.W. Woychik N.A.

Their activity is often regulated by an inhibitory helix, defined by a conserved (S/T)XXXE(G/N) sequence, that occupies the Fic active site to prevent nucleotide docking (15.Engel P. Goepfert A. Stanger F.V. Harms A. Schmidt A. Schirmer T. Dehio C. Adenylylation control by intra- or intermolecular active-site obstruction in Fic proteins.Nature. 2012; 482: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Removal of the helix from the active site by mutating the conserved Glu relieves inhibition. The human genome encodes a single Fic protein, called HYPE/FicD (5.Worby C.A. Mattoo S. Kruger R.P. Corbeil L.B. Koller A. Mendez J.C. Zekarias B. Lazar C. Dixon J.E. The fic domain: regulation of cell signaling by adenylylation.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). HYPE was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen where it interacted with the polyQ region of huntingtin, mutations within which cause Huntington disease (16.Faber P.W. Barnes G.T. Srinidhi J. Chen J. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Huntingtin interacts with a family of WW domain proteins.Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1463-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). HYPE is highly conserved among eukaryotes, with human HYPE displaying high amino acid sequence similarity to its eukaryotic orthologs as follows: mouse (Mus musculus), 89.5%; zebrafish (Danio rerio), 76%; fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), 55%; and worm (Caenorhabditis elegans), 45.4%. Using Rho GTPases, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, as artificial substrates in an in vitro adenylylation assay, we previously showed that HYPE preferentially uses ATP as a nucleotide source and functions as an adenylyltransferase (4.Mattoo S. Durrant E. Chen M.J. Xiao J. Lazar C.S. Manning G. Dixon J.E. Worby C.A. Comparative analysis of Histophilus somni immunoglobulin-binding protein A (IbpA) with other fic domain-containing enzymes reveals differences in substrate and nucleotide specificities.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 32834-32842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, compared with bacterial Fic proteins like Histophilus somni IbpA that adenylylate Rho GTPases, enzymatic activity associated with WT HYPE was extremely weak (4.Mattoo S. Durrant E. Chen M.J.

The fic domain: regulation of cell signaling by adenylylation.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Accordingly, overexpression of HYPE in HeLa cells failed to induce a cytotoxic phenotype typical of that seen with IbpA (5.Worby C.A. Mattoo S. Kruger R.P. Corbeil L.B. Koller A. Mendez J.C. Zekarias B. Lazar C. Dixon J.E. The fic domain: regulation of cell signaling by adenylylation.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We reasoned that HYPE's weak enzymatic activity against Rho GTPases suggests that Rho GTPases may not be its physiological targets and/or that HYPE's active site was blocked by its inhibitory helix. Accordingly, a mutation of HYPE's Glu-234 to Gly in the context of HYPE's Fic domain alone (aa 187â€“437) was shown to relieve this inhibition by removing the inhibitory helix from the Fic active site (15.Engel P. Goepfert A. Stanger F.V. Harms A. Schmidt A. Schirmer T. Dehio C. Adenylylation control by intra- or intermolecular active-site obstruction in Fic proteins.Nature. 2012; 482: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Here, we have characterized HYPE's enzymatic activity in vitro and in tissue culture cells, and we show that uncontrolled HYPE activity induces apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HYPE localizes to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and adenylylates an ER resident chaperone, BiP, at Ser-365 and Thr-366. BiP is critical for protein quality control and maintaining ER homeostasis (1.Bernales S. Papa F.R. Walter P. Intracellular signaling by the unfolded protein response.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Biochem. 2005; 74: 739-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that HYPE expression is up-regulated upon induction of UPR, and knockdown of HYPE prevents activation of UPR. We postulate that HYPE regulates UPR progression by adenylylating BiP. Our study is the first functional demonstration of the physiological significance of Fic-mediated adenylylation in mammalian cell signaling. HYPE clones were obtained by PCR using human HYPE cDNA (from Origene) as template. Accession numbers for HYPE and its orthologs are as follows: Homo sapiens HYPE/FicD, NP_009007.2; M. musculus HYPE, NP_001010825.2; D. rerio HYPE, B1350952.1; D. melanogaster HYPE, NP_609026.1; and C. elegans HYPE, NP_502036.1. Rho GTPase clones were obtained from the Missouri S&T cDNA Resource Center and re-cloned as described previously (5.Worby C.A. Mattoo S. Kruger R.P. Corbeil L.B. Koller A. Mendez J.C. Zekarias B.

For protein production, HYPE wild-type gene encoding amino acids 46â€“458 and GRP78 (BiP) wild-type gene encoding amino acids 19â€“637 were cloned as an N-terminal His6-SUMO fusion in pSMT3 (Addgene). For expression in mammalian cells, full-length HYPE wild-type gene was cloned with a C-terminal FLAG tag into pCDNA3.1 (Addgene) or with a C-terminal GFP tag into pEGFPN1 (Clontech).

Protein expression was induced for 12â€“16 h at 18 Â°C with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole) containing 1 mm PMSF protease inhibitor and purified using a cobalt resin. Resin was washed with wash buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 40 mm imidazole). Next, His6-SUMO-tagged wild-type HYPEÎ”N45, HYPEÎ”N45-E234G, HYPEÎ”N45-E234G/H363A, and their corresponding autoadenylylation site mutants (T76A/S77A, S79A/T80A, T183A, and S79A/T80A/T183A) were eluted from the resin using elution buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 350 mm imidazole). Wild-type HYPEÎ”102 (used for ATPase assays) as well as WT BiP (aa 19â€“637) and its adenylylation site mutant BiP-S365A/T366A were also purified as described above. The protein mixture was desalted into buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 50 mm NaCl) using PD-10 desalting columns (GE Healthcare) and re-applied to a cobalt column, and flow-through containing HYPE proteins was further purified by ion exchange chromatography using 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, with a salt gradient from 10 mm to 1 m NaCl. Fractions containing HYPE were further purified by size exclusion chromatography in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 100 mm NaCl. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford method. Purity was determined by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were stored at âˆ’80 Â°C. 0.1 Î¼g of His6-SUMO-tagged wild-type or mutant HYPE (aa 46â€“458) protein was incubated either alone or with 8 Î¼g of WT-BiP (aa 19â€“637) or BiP-S365A/T366A mutant in an adenylylation reaction containing 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm manganese chloride tetrahydrate, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.01 mCi [Î±-32P]ATP for 15 min. Where mentioned, manganese was replaced with 1 mm calcium chloride, 1 mm cobalt chloride, 1 mm zinc sulfate, or 1 mm magnesium chloride in the buffer. Reactions were stopped with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Where mentioned, 20 mm EDTA was added to the adenylylation reaction to chelate metal ions. Reaction products were separated on 10 or 4â€“20% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. Bands were quantified using Typhoon phosphorimager and ImageJ software. Protein bands were excised from the gel, chopped into small (âˆ¼1 mm) pieces, destained with 25 mm NH4HCO3 in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, and digested as described previously (18.Shevchenko A. Tomas H. Havlis J. Olsen J.V. Mann M. In-gel digestion for mass spectrometric characterization of proteins and proteomes.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2856-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (3547) Google Scholar). Resulting peptides were loaded into a capillary C18 column (15 cm Ã— 75 Î¼m, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) coupled to a nano-HPLC system (1100 series, Agilent) equilibrated with 5% (v/v) mobile phase B (mobile phase A, 0.1 formic acid in water; mobile phase B, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile), and eluted with the following gradient: 5% B for 5 min, 5â€“40% B in 50 min, 40â€“90% B in 8 min, and hold at 90% B for 6 min. The flow rate was set at 300 nl/min. Eluting peptides were analyzed online by electrospray ionization on an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Full-MS scans were collected at 30,000 mass resolution at 400 m/z in a range of 300â€“2000 m/z, and the eight most intense ions were selected for collision-induced dissociation in the linear trap (35% normalized collision energy), before being dynamically excluded for 1 min. Data were processed and searched against the human SwissProt database (22,723 sequences, downloaded on July 9, 2013) using the MaxQuant package (version 1.4.0.8) in two rounds (19.Cox J. Mann M. MaxQuant enables high peptide identification rates, individualized p.p.b.â€“range mass accuracies and proteome-wide protein quantification.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (9223) Google Scholar). In the first round, peptides were searched using cysteine carbamidomethylation (+57.0215 Da) and 20 ppm and 0.5 Da for precursor and fragment mass tolerances, respectively. After recalibration, peptides were re-searched using the following parameters: 1) trypsin digestion in both peptide termini because of missed cleavage sites; 2) methionine oxidation (+15.9949 Da) and adenylylation (+329.0525 Da) of serine, threonine, and tyrosine as variable modifications; 3) cysteine carbamidomethylation as fixed modification; and 4) 4.5 ppm and 0.5 Da for precursor and fragment mass tolerances, respectively. The data were filtered with a false discovery rate of â‰¤0.01 in both peptide and protein levels. Human epithelium HEK293A, HEK293T, and HeLa cells and human breast cancer MCF7 cells were cultured in Dulbeccoâ€™s modified Eagleâ€™s medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies) and 100 Î¼g/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma) at 37 Â°C with 5% CO2. FuGENE HD (Promega) was used for transfections according to the manufacturerâ€™s directions. Cells were transfected for 10 h or 30 h, as indicated for each experiment. For detection of apoptosis, cells were incubated with DMSO for 3 h or 25 Î¼m Z-VAD-fmk (R&D Systems) or DMSO for 2 h, prior to treatment with 1 Î¼m staurosporine (Sigma). Samples were analyzed either by microscopy or by Western blot analysis following a sample preparation. For induction of unfolded protein response, HEK293T cells were treated with 1 Î¼g/ml thapsigargin (Sigma) or 2.5 Î¼g/ml tunicamycin (Calbiochem) for specific time points. Cells were harvested, washed, and prepared for RNA isolation. For siRNA-mediated knockdown of HYPE, HEK293T cells were transfected with 10 Î¼m FicD siRNA (Life Technologies, s22000 and s21999) for 48 h, using FuGENE HD (Promega) according to the manufacturer's directions. Cells were harvested, washed, and prepared for RNA isolation. For immunofluorescence, cells were washed with 1Ã— PBS, fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, blocked with 2.5% (v/v) FBS in PBS for 30 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Primary antibody to HYPE (Abcam), BiP (Cell Signaling), GM130 (BD Biosystems), EEA1 (Cell Signaling), calreticulin (Abcam), or Mitotracker Red (Life Technologies) was incubated for 1 h and washed with PBS; the secondary antibody was incubated for 1 h, washed with PBS, and visualized by confocal microscopy. Fluorescence protease protection assay was done as described previously (20.Lorenz H. Hailey D.W. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Addressing membrane protein topology using the fluorescence protease protection (FPP) assay.Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 440: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Mitoneet-GFP and BiP-GFP were used as mitochondrial and ER lumen-specific controls (21.Wiley S.E. Rardin M.J. Dixon J.E.

The postnuclear supernatant was spun at 15,000 Ã— g to pellet the ER/microsome-enriched fraction, which was further separated over Histogenz density gradients. Equal amounts of protein from each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. The ER fraction was then treated with trypsin as described previously (23.Zelenski N.G.

Primary antibodies against HYPE (Abcam), BiP (Cell Signaling), calnexin (Cell Signaling), and mitochondrial complex I (Mitosciences) were used to detect these proteins in the tissue fractions. For microscopy, HEK293A cells transfected with HYPE or HYPE mutants were observed by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axiovert 200 M and AMG EVOS). EGFP was excited at 488 nm; fluorescence was monitored between 510 and 520 nm. Cell morphology was observed using differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy (Zeiss Axiovert 200 M). Fluorescence and DIC images were overlaid using the Zeiss software. For immunoprecipitation, HEK293T and MCF7 cells were lysed with modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P40, containing 1.0 mm Pefabloc (Roche Applied Science), 1.0 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 1 Î¼m leupeptin, 1 Î¼m E64). The homogenates were pre-cleared with 25 Î¼l of protein A/G beads (Pierce), centrifuged at 14,000 Ã— g at 4 Â°C for 10 min, and the supernatant was incubated with anti-HYPE antibody (Abcam) or anti-BiP antibody (Cell Signaling) for 2â€“4 h at 4 Â°C with gentle rotation followed by incubation with 25 Î¼l of protein A/G beads (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 Â°C with gentle rotation. Beads were washed three times with ice-cold modified RIPA buffer, resuspended in 20 Î¼l of 1Ã— SDS loading buffer, and denatured at 95 Â°C for 5â€“7 min. For Western blot analysis, HEK293A and HeLa cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, 100 Î¼m PMSF, 10% glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.4) for 15 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 18,000 Ã— g for 15 min at 4 Â°C, and the supernatant was mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and denatured at 95 Â°C for 6 min. Protein samples were resolved on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Blots were probed with primary antibodies to cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (cPARP; Abcam), FLAG-M2 (Sigma), GFP (Clontech), HYPE (Abcam), actin (Sigma), GAPDH (Amicon), AMPylated threonine (Millipore), AMPylated tyrosine (Millipore), or BiP (Cell Signaling). Secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescent dyes or horseradish peroxidase were used for detection using the Odyssey detection system (LI-COR Biosciences) or film. HEK293A cells were collected, resuspended in cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, 100 Î¼m PMSF, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.4), and kept on ice for 15 min. The supernatant was mixed with anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) and incubated at 4 Â°C with gentle shaking for 1 h. The precipitate was washed three times and heated in Glycoprotein denaturing buffer (New England Biolabs) at 100 Â°C for 10 min. The samples were then either left untreated or treated with endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37 Â°C as per the manufacturer's protocol. The products were analyzed by Western blot. Total cell RNA was extracted with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). 5 Î¼g of RNA were treated with DNase (New England Biolabs) and reverse-transcribed with random primers using the Superscript III First Strand Synthesis System (Life Technologies). 2 Î¼l of a 1:10 dilution of cDNA were used for quantitative PCR with specific primers and SYBR Green PCR master mix 2 (Applied Biosystems) for 40 cycles in a CFX96 real time PCR system (Bio-Rad), according to the manufacturer's instructions, HYPE, GRP78, CHOP, and Xbp1 Ct was normalized to GAPDH Ct for each condition.

https://openalex.org/W1972164577,"Stimulus discrimination depends on the selectivity and variability of neural responses, as well as the size and correlation structure of the responsive population. For direction discrimination in visual cortex, only the selectivity of neurons has been well characterized across development. Here we show in ferrets that at eye opening, the cortical response to visual stimulation exhibits several immaturities, including a high density of active neurons that display prominent wave-like activity, a high degree of variability and strong noise correlations. Over the next three weeks, the population response becomes increasingly sparse, wave-like activity disappears, and variability and noise correlations are markedly reduced. Similar changes were observed in identified neuronal populations imaged repeatedly over days. Furthermore, experience with a moving stimulus was capable of driving a reduction in noise correlations over a matter of hours. These changes in variability and correlation contribute significantly to a marked improvement in direction discriminability over development."

Among the studied primary and secondary bile acids, chenodeoxycholic acid, which has the highest binding affinity to FXR, induced miR-22 level in both Huh7 liver and HCT116 colon cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, cyclin A2 (CCNA2) was identified as a miR-22 novel target in liver and colon cancer cells. The sequence of miR-22, which is conserved in mice, rats, humans, and other mammalians, aligns with the sequence of 3â€²-UTR of CCNA2. Chenodeoxycholic acid treatment and miR-22 mimics reduced CCNA2 protein and increased the number of G0/G1 Huh7 and HCT116 cells. In FXR KO mice, reduction of miR-22 was accompanied by elevated hepatic and ileal CCNA2 protein, as well as an increased number of hepatic and colonic Ki-67-positive cells. In humans, the expression levels of miR-22 and CCNA2 are inversely correlated in liver and colon cancers. Taken together, our data showed that bile acid-activated FXR stimulates miR-22-silenced CCNA2, a novel pathway for FXR to exert its protective effect in the gastrointestinal tract.

https://openalex.org/W2095067227,"Traditional medicine has been practised in Ghana for centuries with the majority of Ghanaians still patronising the services of traditional healers. Throughout Africa a large number of people use pangolins as a source of traditional medicine, however, there is a dearth of information on the use of animals in folk medicine in Ghana, in particular the use of pangolins. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalent use of pangolins and the level of knowledge of pangolin use among traditional healers in Ghana for the treatment of human ailments. Data was gathered from 48 traditional healers using semi-structured interviews on the traditional medicinal use of pangolin body parts in the Kumasi metropolis of Ghana. The cultural importance index, relative frequency of citation, informant agreement ratio and use agreement values were calculated to ascertain the most culturally important pangolin body part as well as the level of knowledge dissemination among traditional healers with regards pangolin body parts. Our study revealed that 13 body parts of pangolins are used to treat various medicinal ailments. Pangolin scales and bones were the most prevalent prescribed body parts and indicated the highest cultural significance among traditional healing practices primarily for the treatment of spiritual protection, rheumatism, financial rituals and convulsions. Despite being classified under Schedule 1 of Ghanaâ€™s Wildlife Conservation Act of 1971 (LI 685), that prohibits anyone from hunting or being in possession of a pangolin, our results indicated that the use of pangolins for traditional medicinal purposes is widespread among traditional healers in Ghana. A study on the population status and ecology of the three species of African pangolins occurring in Ghana is urgently required in order to determine the impact this harvest for traditional medical purposes has on their respective populations as current levels appear to be unmonitored and unsustainable."
https://openalex.org/W1968448258,"The construction of ClpX hexamers containing variable numbers and configurations of wild-type and grip-defective pore loops supports a model of concurrent loop movement that ensures substrate unfolding and translocation. Hexameric ATP-dependent proteases and protein remodeling machines use conserved loops that line the axial pore to apply force to substrates during the mechanical processes of protein unfolding and translocation. Whether loops from multiple subunits act independently or coordinately in these processes is a critical aspect of the mechanism but is currently unknown for any AAA+ machine. By studying covalently linked hexamers of the Escherichia coli ClpX unfoldase bearing different numbers and configurations of wild-type and mutant pore loops, we show that loops function synergistically, and the number of wild-type loops required for efficient degradation is dependent on the stability of the protein substrate. Our results support a mechanism in which a power stroke initiated in one subunit of the ClpX hexamer results in the concurrent movement of all six pore loops, which coordinately grip and apply force to the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1982329113,"DNA barcoding has been proposed to be one of the most promising tools for accurate and rapid identification of taxa. However, few publications have evaluated the efficiency of DNA barcoding for the large genera of flowering plants. Dendrobium, one of the largest genera of flowering plants, contains many species that are important in horticulture, medicine and biodiversity conservation. Besides, Dendrobium is a notoriously difficult group to identify. DNA barcoding was expected to be a supplementary means for species identification, conservation and future studies in Dendrobium. We assessed the power of 11 candidate barcodes on the basis of 1,698 accessions of 184 Dendrobium species obtained primarily from mainland Asia. Our results indicated that five single barcodes, i.e., ITS, ITS2, matK, rbcL and trnH-psbA, can be easily amplified and sequenced with the currently established primers. Four barcodes, ITS, ITS2, ITS+matK, and ITS2+matK, have distinct barcoding gaps. ITS+matK was the optimal barcode based on all evaluation methods. Furthermore, the efficiency of ITS+matK was verified in four other large genera including Ficus, Lysimachia, Paphiopedilum, and Pedicularis in this study. Therefore, we tentatively recommend the combination of ITS+matK as a core DNA barcode for large flowering plant genera."
https://openalex.org/W2109643319,"Identification of key drivers and new therapeutic targets is important given the poor prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, particularly those ineligible for surgical resection or liver transplant. However, the approach to identify such driver genes is facing significant challenges due to the genomically heterogenous nature of HCC. Here we tested whether the integrative genomic profiling of a well-defined HCC subset that is classified by an extreme EpCAM+ AFP+ gene expression signature and associated with poor prognosis, all attributes of a stem cell-like phenotype, could uncover survival-related driver genes in HCC. Following transcriptomic analysis of the well-defined HCC cases, a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis coupled with genomic copy number alteration assessment revealed that YY1-associated protein 1 (YY1AP1) is a critical oncoprotein specifically activated in EpCAM+ AFP+ HCC. YY1AP1 silencing eliminates oncogene addiction by altering the chromatin landscape and triggering massive apoptosis in vitro and tumor suppression in vivo. YY1AP1 expression promotes HCC proliferation and is required for the maintenance of stem cell features. We revealed that YY1AP1 cooperates with YY1 to alter the chromatin landscape and activate transcription of stemness regulators. Thus YY1AP1 may serve as a key molecular target for EpCAM+ AFP+ HCC subtype. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and power of a new strategy by utilizing well-defined patient samples and integrative genomics to uncover critical pathways linked to HCC subtypes with prognostic impact."

Nine clinical research centers (CRC) in sub-Saharan Africa conducted HIV observational epidemiology studies in populations at risk for HIV infection as part of an HIV prevention and vaccine trial network. Annual HIV incidence ranged from below 2% to above 10% and varied by CRC and risk group, with rates above 5% observed in Zambian men in an HIV-discordant relationship, Ugandan men from Lake Victoria fishing communities, men who have sex with men, and several cohorts of women. HIV incidence tended to fall after the first three months in the study and over calendar time. Among suspected transmission pairs, 28% of HIV infections were not from the reported partner. Volunteers with high incidence were successfully identified and enrolled into large scale cohort studies. Over a quarter of new cases in couples acquired infection from persons other than the suspected transmitting partner."
https://openalex.org/W1989882391,"Zirconium (Zr) is an element commonly used in dental and orthopedic implants either as zirconia (ZrO2) or in metal alloys. It can also be incorporated into calcium silicate-based ceramics. However, the effects of in vitro culture of human osteoblasts (HOBs) with soluble ionic forms of Zr have not been determined. In this study, primary culture of human osteoblasts was conducted in the presence of medium containing either ZrCl4 or Zirconium (IV) oxynitrate (ZrO(NO3)2) at concentrations of 0, 5, 50 and 500 ÂµM, and osteoblast proliferation, differentiation and calcium deposition were assessed. Incubation of human osteoblast cultures with Zr ions increased the proliferation of human osteoblasts and also gene expression of genetic markers of osteoblast differentiation. In 21 and 28 day cultures, Zr ions at concentrations of 50 and 500 ÂµM increased the deposition of calcium phosphate. In addition, the gene expression of BMP2 and BMP receptors was increased in response to culture with Zr ions and this was associated with increased phosphorylation of SMAD1/5. Moreover, Noggin suppressed osteogenic gene expression in HOBs co-treated with Zr ions. In conclusion, Zr ions appear able to induce both the proliferation and the differentiation of primary human osteoblasts. This is associated with up-regulation of BMP2 expression and activation of BMP signaling suggesting this action is, at least in part, mediated by BMP signaling."

Recently, PHF6 was identified to interact with the NuRD complex, and this interaction is mediated by the RBBP4 component. However, little is known about the molecular basis for the interaction. Here, we present the crystal structure of the complex of the NuRD subunit RBBP4 bound to the PHF6 peptide (residues 162â€“170). The PHF6 peptide binds to the top surface of the RBBP4 Î²-propeller. A pair of positively charged residues of the PHF6 peptide insert into the negatively charged pocket of RBBP4, which is critical for the interaction between PHF6 and RBBP4.

Structural comparison shows that the PHF6-binding pocket overlaps with FOG1 and histone H3 on RBBP4/Nurf55, but it is distinct from the pocket recognizing histone H4, Su(z)12, and MTA1. We further show that the middle disordered region (residues 145â€“207, containing the RBBP4-binding motif) is sufficient for the transcriptional repression mediated by PHF6 on the GAL4 reporter, and knockdown of RBBP4 diminished the PHF6-mediated repression.

PHF6 has been found to be a novel interactor with the NuRD complex in the nucleoplasm, which confirms a role for PHF6 in modifying chromatin structure and gene regulation (19.Todd M.A. Picketts D.J. PHF6 interacts with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex.J. Proteome Res. 2012; 11: 4326-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in our previous work, we showed that the PHF6 protein can directly interact with the NuRD complex component RBBP4 and that the interaction is mediated by the nucleolar localization sequence (NoLS) composed of NLS3 and NLS4 of PHF6 (20.Liu Z. Li F. Ruan K. Zhang J. Mei Y. Wu J. Shi Y. Structural and functional insights into the human BÃ¶rjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome-associated protein PHF6.J. Biol.

To study the molecular basis of this interaction, we subsequently determined the crystal structure of RBBP4 in complex with a PHF6 peptide (residues 157â€“171). The complex structure reveals that the PHF6 peptide binds to the top surface of the WD40 domain of RBBP4. The interaction between RBBP4 and PHF6 is highly specific, and mutations or deletions of the NoLS region of PHF6 reduced or abolished the interaction in vitro and in vivo. The RBBP4-binding motif of PHF6 is highly conserved in terrestrial vertebrates. In addition, we demonstrated that the middle disordered region of PHF6 (residues 145â€“207, containing the RBBP4-binding motif) is sufficient for transcriptional repression and that the repression is moderately dependent on RBBP4. RBBP4 knockdown by shRNA reduced the PHF6-mediated transcriptional repression. Full-length human RBBP4 (residues 1â€“425) was cloned into a pFastBac HT-B vector encoding an N-terminal His6 tag and a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site and expressed in Tn5 cells infected with baculovirus using the Bac-to-Bac expression methodology (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Infected cells were resuspended on ice in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 500 mm NaCl), lysed by sonication, and clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 8 Â°C. The beads were collected and washed with lysis buffer containing 30 mm imidazole. RBBP4 was eluted with 0.5 m imidazole, and the N-terminal His6 tag was removed with tobacco etch virus protease. RBBP4 was further purified with 16/60 Superdex 200 size exclusion columns (GE Healthcare) and concentrated up to 10 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl. Wild-type PHF6 (residues 157â€“171) and mutant peptides used in the study were chemically synthesized by GL Biochem (Shanghai, China). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed using a MicroCal iTC200 titration calorimeter (GE Healthcare). PHF6 peptides were injected into a sample cell containing 50 Î¼m RBBP4 in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl at 24 Â°C. The titration data were analyzed using Origin 7 (OriginLab Corp.), provided with the iTC200 calorimeter. The RBBP4-PHF6 peptide (residues 157â€“171) complex was prepared by incubating 10 mg/ml protein with peptide at a 1:1.2 molar ratio overnight at 4 Â°C and crystallized by mixing equal volumes of protein and crystallization solution using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. Single crystals were obtained in 0.1 m potassium thiocyanate and 30% PEG MME 2000 at 16 Â°C, and the crystals were harvested, soaked in the mother liquor containing 25% glycerol, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data sets were collected on beamline 17U at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The initial data were indexed and integrated with iMosflm (21.Battye T.G. Kontogiannis L. Johnson O.

Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) with the following plasmids: pGAL-TK-Luc (0.3 Î¼g), pRK5 (GAL4 DNA-binding domain) or pRK5-PHF6 (wild-type or mutation or deletion mutants; GAL4 DNA-binding domain-PHF6 fusion; 0.4 Î¼g), or the Renilla reporter vector pRL-luciferase (25 ng) as a normalization control for transfection efficiency. The cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay system (Promega). A lentivirus-mediated knockdown system (pLKO.1, vesicular stomatitis virus G, Gag, and Rev) was used to knock down the RBBP4 gene. The RBBP4 knockdown vectors and control vector were present in the pLKO.1-puro plasmids and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The RBBP4 shRNA sequence was 5â€²-CCGGGCCTTTCTTTCAATCCTTATACTCGAGTATAAGGATTGAAAGAAAGGCTTTTTG-3â€². HEK293T cells were grown in the presence of 1 Î¼g/ml puromycin for selecting the positive cells. Cells were lysed by incubation in TBST buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture) for 15â€“30 min on a shaker, and the extract was cleared by centrifugation. The supernatant was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4 Â°C. The resin was washed three times with TBST buffer and boiled in loading buffer. The following antibodies were used: anti-RBBP4 (ab79416, Abcam), anti-FLAG (DYKDDDDK tag antibody, 26368, Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-Î²-actin (sc-47778, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). We previously reported that residues 152â€“171 of PHF6 can directly interact with RBBP4 (RbAp48) in GST pulldown assays in vitro (20.Liu Z. Li F. Ruan K. Zhang J. Mei Y. Wu J. Shi Y. Structural and functional insights into the human BÃ¶rjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome-associated protein PHF6.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 10069-10083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). ITC was conducted using a synthetic optimized PHF6 peptide (residues 157â€“171) to titrate RBBP4 (Fig. 1A) and therefore determined the binding affinity of RBBP4 for PHF6. The ITC experimental data revealed that this peptide bound to RBBP4 with a stoichiometry of âˆ¼1:1 and a dissociation constant (Kd) of 7.1 Â± 0.4 Î¼m (Fig. 1B). Full-length RBBP4 was co-crystallized with the PHF6(157â€“171) peptide to gain insight into how RBBP4 recognizes PHF6. The complex crystallized in space group P21, and the structure was solved at 1.85 â„« by molecular replacement using the RBBP4 structure as an initial search model. Data collection and refinement statistics are outlined in Table 1. There was one molecule/asymmetric unit. Among the 15 amino acids in the PHF6 peptide, only 9 amino acids (residues 162â€“170) are visible in the final model (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the structure of RBBP4 (residues 15â€“410) encompasses seven WD40 repeats forming a Î²-propeller structure with an additional Î±-helix at the N terminus (Fig. 2A). The N-terminal 14 residues; loop region residues 55â€“60, 89â€“113, and 354â€“359; and C-terminal residues 411â€“425 are disordered and invisible in the final electron density maps. The complex structure shows that the PHF6 peptide binds to RBBP4 in an extended conformation across the central channel on the smaller face of the Î²-propeller disc (Fig. 2B). An electrostatic potential surface representation of the PHF6 peptide-binding pocket of RBBP4 shows that a highly negatively charged surface with a hole at the top of RBBP4 is used to recognize the PHF6 peptide (Fig. 3A). A refined 2Fo âˆ’ Fc map at 1Ïƒ reveals a clear electron density for residues 162â€“170 in the PHF6 peptide (Fig. 3B). The clear electron density for the PHF6 peptide in the map shows the orientation of the peptide in the complex and multiple hydrogen bond interactions with RBBP4 (Fig. 3B). A network of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts anchor the PHF6 peptide into its binding cleft at the top of RBBP4 (Fig. 3, B and C). The side chain of Arg-163 directly inserts into the acidic central channel, which traverses the core of RBBP4 (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, its guanidinium group is sandwiched between the aromatic side chains of Tyr-181 and Phe-321 in this cleft, forming cation-Ï€ interactions (Fig. 3, B and C). The guanidinium group of Arg-163 is further pinioned through hydrogen bonding to the side chain of Glu-231, water-mediated hydrogen bonding to the main chain carbonyl groups of Glu-231 and Asn-277, and its main chain carbonyl group interacting with the Lys-376 side chain in RBBP4 (Fig. 3, B and C). Lys-164 in the PHF6 peptide interacts with RBBP4 through its side chain, forming polar interactions with the side chains of Glu-179 and Glu-126 and a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asn-128. In addition, van der Waals contacts occur between the side chain of Leu-45 in RBBP4 and the aliphatic part of Lys-164 (Fig. 3, B and C). The backbone amide of Gly-165 in the peptide forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the side chain of Glu-395 in RBBP4. Pro-167 in the peptide forms van der Waals contacts within a small pocket composed of His-71, Thr-72, Ser-73, and Pro-43 in the peptide-binding cleft. The backbone amide and carbonyl oxygen of Arg-168 participate in direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Asn-397 and the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Glu-395 in RBBP4 (Fig. 3, B and C). Lys-169 in the peptide forms polar interactions with the side chain of Glu-75, and further van der Waals contacts occur between its aliphatic part and the side chains of Trp-42 and Glu-41 in RBBP4 (Fig. 3, B and C). The final visible residue in the PHF6 peptide, Thr-170, interacts with RBBP4 through three hydrogen bonds between its backbone amide, the hydroxyl group, and the main chain carbonyl groups of Leu-40 and Glu-41 (Fig. 3, B and C). To elucidate the determinants that are crucial for conferring binding specificity, the affinities of RBBP4 for PHF6 peptide mutants were measured by ITC. Affinities between the PHF6(157â€“171) peptide with mutations R163A, K164A, or R163A/K164A and RBBP4 were reduced by 7-, 5-, and 30-fold, respectively, compared with that of the wild-type PHF6 peptide (Fig. 3D). To assess the interaction of PHF6 with RBBP4 in vivo, co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed using full-length PHF6. Lysates from HEK293T cells expressing FLAG-tagged full-length PHF6 or mutants were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, followed by Western blot analysis with anti-RBBP4 antibody. Compared with FLAG-tagged wild-type full-length PHF6, the mutants led to a significant reduction or loss of binding to RBBP4 (Fig. 3E). These results support the structural basis for PHF6 recognition by RBBP4 in vivo and in vitro. The PHF6-binding site on RBBP4 has previously been shown to be occupied by N-terminal residues 1â€“15 of FOG1 (friend of GATA1) (28.Lejon S. Thong S.Y. Murthy A. AlQarni S. Murzina N.V. Blobel G.A. Laue E.D. Mackay J.P. Insights into association of the NuRD complex with FOG-1 from the crystal structure of an RbAp48Â·FOG-1 complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1196-1203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Comparison of the RBBP4-PHF6 peptide complex structure with the reported crystal structure of the RBBP4-FOG1 complex reveals that the PHF6 peptide binds to the same groove in an extended conformation as the FOG1(1â€“12) peptide on the top surface of the WD40 repeats of RBBP4 (28.Lejon S. Thong S.Y. Murthy A. AlQarni S. Murzina N.V. Blobel G.A. Laue E.D. Mackay J.P. Insights into association of the NuRD complex with FOG-1 from the crystal structure of an RbAp48Â·FOG-1 complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1196-1203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Similar to the recognition of FOG1 by RBBP4, Arg-163 of the PHF6 peptide extends inside the same central cavity of RBBP4 as FOG1 Arg-4, and PHF6 Lys-164 and Pro-167 interact with the same residues of RBBP4 as FOG1 Lys-5 and Pro-9, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B). The detailed comparison of the RBBP4-PHF6 structure with that of FOG1 bound to RBBP4/RbAp48 strongly suggests that the binding of PHF6 and FOG1 is mutually exclusive (Fig. 4, A and B). Sequence alignment between PHF6 orthologs reveals that the RBBP4-binding motif is highly conserved in terrestrial vertebrates, but not in fishes and frogs (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, the structure revealed that Arg-163 and Lys-164 of PHF6 interact with RBBP4 in a manner similar to FOG1 with RBBP4/RbAp48 and histone H3 with Nurf55 (28.Lejon S. Thong S.Y. Murthy A.

The aim of our study was to investigate the clinical and microbiological characteristics of patients with non-O1 V. cholera infections.The clinical charts of all patients with non-O1 V. cholera infections and who were treated in two hospitals in Taiwan were retrospectively reviewed.From July 2009 to June 2014, a total of 83 patients with non-O1 V. cholera infections were identified based on the databank of the bacteriology laboratories of two hospitals. The overall mean age was 53.3 years, and men comprised 53 (63.9%) of the patients. Liver cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus were the two most common underlying diseases, followed by malignancy. The most common type of infection was acute gastroenteritis (n = 45, 54.2%), followed by biliary tract infection (n = 12, 14.5%) and primary bacteremia (n = 11, 13.3%). Other types of infection, such as peritonitis (n = 5, 6.0%), skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) (n = 5, 6.0%), urinary tract infection (n = 3, 3.6%) and pneumonia (2, 2.4%), were rare. July and June were the most common months of occurrence of V. cholera infections. The overall in-hospital mortality of 83 patients with V. cholera infections was 7.2%, but it was significantly higher for patients with primary bacteremia, hemorrhage bullae, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory failure, or admission to an ICU. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that in-hospital mortality was significantly associated with acute respiratory failure (odds ratio, 60.47; 95% CI, 4.79-763.90, P = 0.002).Non-O1 V. cholera infections can cause protean disease, especially in patients with risk factors and during warm-weather months. The overall mortality of 83 patients with non-O1 V. cholera infections was only 7.2%; however, this value varied among different types of infection."
https://openalex.org/W2002986768,"Studies suggest a relationship between hypertension and outcome in bevacizumab-treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We performed a retrospective analysis of two phase II studies (BECA and BECOX) to determine if hypertension and proteinuria predict outcome in elderly patients with mCRC treated with bevacizumab.Patients â‰¥ 70 years of age received either capecitabine 1250 mg/m(2) bid days 1-14 + bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg day 1 every 21 days (BECA study) or capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) bid days 1-14 with bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2) day 1 (BECOX study). The primary objective was to correlate hypertension and proteinuria with overall response rate (ORR), time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). Secondary objectives included identification of risk factors associated with the development of hypertension and proteinuria and determining whether development of hypertension or proteinuria in the first 2 cycles was related to ORR, disease-control rate (DCR), TTP or OS.In total, 127 patients (median age 75.5 years) were included in the study. Hypertension correlated with DCR and OS; proteinuria correlated with ORR and DCR. Proteinuria or hypertension in the first 2 cycles did not correlate with efficacy. Risk factors for hypertension were female gender (odds ratio [OR] 0.241; P = 0.011) and more bevacizumab cycles (OR 1.112; P = 0.002); risk factors for proteinuria were diabetes (OR 3.869; P = 0.006) and more bevacizumab cycles (OR 1.181; P<0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified as having prognostic value: baseline lactate dehydrogenase, haemoglobin, number of metastatic lesions and DCR.This analysis of two phase II studies suggests that hypertension is significantly correlated with OS but not with ORR and TTP, whereas proteinuria is correlated with ORR but not with OS and TTP. Both hypertension and proteinuria are associated with the duration of bevacizumab treatment and do not represent an independent prognostic factor."

The present study was undertaken to identify markers in genes supposedly related to wood property traits in three Eucalyptus species. Ninety four genes involved in xylogenesis were selected for hybridization probe based nuclear genomic DNA target enrichment and exome sequencing. Genomic DNA was isolated from the leaf tissues and used for on-array probe hybridization followed by Illumina sequencing. The raw sequence reads were trimmed and high-quality reads were mapped to the E. grandis reference sequence and the presence of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/ deletions (InDels) were identified across the three species. The average read coverage was 216X and a total of 2294 SNVs and 479 InDels were discovered in E. camaldulensis, 2383 SNVs and 518 InDels in E. tereticornis, and 1228 SNVs and 409 InDels in E. grandis. Additionally, SNV calling and InDel detection were conducted in pair-wise comparisons of E. tereticornis vs. E. grandis, E. camaldulensis vs. E. tereticornis and E. camaldulensis vs. E. grandis.

https://openalex.org/W1998593492,"Although epigenetic alterations play an essential role in gliomagenesis, the relevance of aberrant histone modifications and the respective enzymes has not been clarified. Experimental data implicates histone H3 lysine (K) methyltransferases SETDB1 and SUV39H1 into glioma pathobiology, whereas linker histone variant H1.0 and H4K20me3 reportedly affect prognosis. We investigated the expression of H3K9me3 and its methyltransferases along with H4K20me3 and H1x in 101 astrocytic tumors with regard to clinicopathological characteristics and survival. The effect of SUV39H1 inhibition by chaetocin on the proliferation, colony formation and migration of T98G cells was also examined. SETDB1 and cytoplasmic SUV39H1 levels increased from normal brain through low-grade to high-grade tumors, nuclear SUV39H1 correlating inversely with grade. H3K9me3 immunoreactivity was higher in normal brain showing no association with grade, whereas H1x and H4K20me3 expression was higher in grade 2 than in normal brain or high grades. These expression patterns of H1x, H4K20me3 and H3K9me3 were verified by Western immunoblotting. Chaetocin treatment significantly reduced proliferation, clonogenic potential and migratory ability of T98G cells. H1x was an independent favorable prognosticator in glioblastomas, this effect being validated in an independent set of 66 patients. Diminished nuclear SUV39H1 expression adversely affected survival in univariate analysis. In conclusion, H4K20me3 and H3K9 methyltransferases are differentially implicated in astroglial tumor progression. Deregulation of H1x emerges as a prognostic biomarker."
https://openalex.org/W2077753916,"The influence of skin substitutes upon angiogenesis during wound healing is unclear.To compare the angiogenic response in acute cutaneous human wounds treated with autogenic, allogenic and xenogenic skin substitutes to those left to heal by secondary intention.On day 0, four 5mm full-thickness punch biopsies were harvested from fifty healthy volunteers (sites 1-4). In all cases, site 1 healed by secondary intention (control), site 2 was treated with collagen-GAG scaffold (CG), cadaveric decellularised dermis (DCD) was applied to site 3, whilst excised tissue was re-inserted into site 4 (autograft). Depending on study group allocation, healing tissue from sites 1-4 was excised on day 7, 14, 21 or 28. All specimens were bisected, with half used in histological and immunohistochemical evaluation whilst extracted RNA from the remainder enabled whole genome microarrays and qRT-PCR of highlighted angiogenesis-related genes. All wounds were serially imaged over 6 weeks using laser-doppler imaging and spectrophotometric intracutaneous analysis.Inherent structural differences between skin substitutes influenced the distribution and organisation of capillary networks within regenerating dermis. Haemoglobin flux (p = 0.0035), oxyhaemoglobin concentration (p = 0.0005), and vessel number derived from CD31-based immunohistochemistry (p = 0.046) were significantly greater in DCD wounds at later time points. This correlated with time-matched increases in mRNA expression of membrane-type 6 matrix metalloproteinase (MT6-MMP) (p = 0.021) and prokineticin 2 (PROK2) (p = 0.004).Corroborating evidence from invasive and non-invasive modalities demonstrated that treatment with DCD resulted in increased angiogenesis after wounding. Significantly elevated mRNA expression of pro-angiogenic PROK2 and extracellular matrix protease MT6-MMP seen only in the DCD group may contribute to observed responses."
https://openalex.org/W2096972010,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are ubiquitous and pervasive, and therefore; highly susceptible to a number of security attacks. Denial of Service (DoS) attack is considered the most dominant and a major threat to WSNs. Moreover, the wormhole attack represents one of the potential forms of the Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Besides, crafting the wormhole attack is comparatively simple; though, its detection is nontrivial. On the contrary, the extant wormhole defense methods need both specialized hardware and strong assumptions to defend against static and dynamic wormhole attack. The ensuing paper introduces a novel scheme to detect wormhole attacks in a geographic routing protocol (DWGRP). The main contribution of this paper is to detect malicious nodes and select the best and the most reliable neighbors based on pairwise key pre-distribution technique and the beacon packet. Moreover, this novel technique is not subject to any specific assumption, requirement, or specialized hardware, such as a precise synchronized clock. The proposed detection method is validated by comparisons with several related techniques in the literature, such as Received Signal Strength (RSS), Authentication of Nodes Scheme (ANS), Wormhole Detection uses Hound Packet (WHOP), and Wormhole Detection with Neighborhood Information (WDI) using the NS-2 simulator. The analysis of the simulations shows promising results with low False Detection Rate (FDR) in the geographic routing protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2039117104,"In indigenous populations, age can be estimated based on family structure and physical examination. However, the accuracy of such methods is questionable. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate occlusal tooth wear related to estimated age in the remote indigenous populations of the Xingu River, Amazon. Two hundred and twenty three semi-isolated indigenous subjects with permanent dentition from the Arara (n = 117), Xicrin-KayapÃ³ (n = 60) and Assurini (n = 46) villages were examined. The control group consisted of 40 non-indigenous individuals living in an urban area in the Amazon basin (Belem). A modified tooth wear index was applied and then associated with chronological age by linear regression analysis. A strong association was found between tooth wear and chronological age in the indigenous populations (p <0.001). Tooth wear measurements were able to explain 86% of the variation in the ages of the Arara sample, 70% of the Xicrin-KaiapÃ³ sample and 65% of the Assurini sample. In the urban control sample, only 12% of ages could be determined by tooth wear. These findings suggest that tooth wear is a poor estimator of chronological age in the urban population; however, it has a strong association with age for the more remote indigenous populations. Consequently, these findings suggest that a simple tooth wear evaluation method, as described and applied in this study, can be used to provide a straightforward and efficient means to assist in age determination of newly contacted indigenous groups."
https://openalex.org/W2315593632,"Multiform glioblastomas (GBM) are the most frequent and aggressive primary brain tumors in adults. The poor prognosis is due to neo-angiogenesis and cellular invasion, processes that require complex chemotaxic mechanisms involving motility, migration and adhesion. Understanding these different cellular events implies identifying receptors and transduction pathways that lead to and promote either migration or adhesion. Here we establish that glioma express the vasoactive peptide urotensin II (UII) and its receptor UT and that UT-mediated signaling cascades are involved in glioma cell migration and adhesion. Components of the urotensinergic systems, UII and UT, are widely expressed in patient-derived GBM tissue sections, glioma cell lines and fresh biopsy explants. Interestingly, gradient concentrations of UII produced chemoattracting migratory/motility effects in glioma as well as HEK293 cells expressing human UT. These effects mainly involved the G13/Rho/rho kinase pathway while partially requiring Gi/o/PI3K components. In contrast, we observed that homogeneous concentrations of UII drastically blocked cell motility and stimulated cell-matrix adhesions through a UT/Gi/o signaling cascade, partially involving phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase. Finally, we provide evidence that, in glioma cells, homogeneous concentration of UII allowed translocation of GÎ±13 to the UT receptor at the plasma membrane and increased actin stress fibers, lamellipodia formation and vinculin-stained focal adhesions. UII also provoked a re-localization of UT precoupled to GÎ±i in filipodia and initiated integrin-stained focal points. Altogether, these findings suggest that UT behaves as a chemotaxic receptor, relaying a signaling switch between directional migration and cell adhesion under gradient or homogeneous concentrations, thereby redefining sequential mechanisms affecting tumor cells during glioma invasion. Taken together, our results allow us to propose a model in order to improve the design of compounds that demonstrate signaling bias for therapies that target specifically the Gi/o signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1965906281,"Retinoblastoma, an embryonic neoplasm of retinal origin, is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in children. Somatic inactivation of both alleles of the RB1 tumor suppressor gene in a retinal progenitor cell through diverse mechanisms including genetic and epigenetic modifications, is the crucial event in initiation of tumorigenesis in most cases of isolated unilateral retinoblastoma. We analyzed DNA from tumor tissue and from peripheral blood to determine the RB1 mutation status and seek correlations with clinical features of 37 unrelated cases of Tunisian origin with sporadic retinoblastoma. All cases were unilateral except one who presented with bilateral disease, in whom no germline coding sequence alteration was identified. A multi-step mutation scanning protocol identified bi-allelic inactivation of RB1 gene in 30 (81%) of the samples tested. A total of 7 novel mutations were identified. There were three tumors without any detectable mutation while a subset contained multiple mutations in RB1 gene. The latter group included tumors collected after treatment with chemotherapy. There were seven individuals with germline mutations and all presented with advanced stage of tumor. There was no difference in age of onset of RB based on the germline mutation status. Thus 20% of the individuals with sporadic unilateral RB in this series carried germline mutations and indicate the importance of genetic testing all children with sporadic retinoblastoma. These findings help to characterize the spectrum of mutations present in the Tunisian population and can improve genetic diagnosis of retinoblastoma."

https://openalex.org/W2100051291,"Chewing of gum contributes to the maintenance of oral health. Many oral diseases, including caries and periodontal disease, are caused by bacteria. However, it is unknown whether chewing of gum can remove bacteria from the oral cavity. Here, we hypothesize that chewing of gum can trap bacteria and remove them from the oral cavity. To test this hypothesis, we developed two methods to quantify numbers of bacteria trapped in chewed gum. In the first method, known numbers of bacteria were finger-chewed into gum and chewed gums were molded to standard dimensions, sonicated and plated to determine numbers of colony-forming-units incorporated, yielding calibration curves of colony-forming-units retrieved versus finger-chewed in. In a second method, calibration curves were created by finger-chewing known numbers of bacteria into gum and subsequently dissolving the gum in a mixture of chloroform and tris-ethylenediaminetetraacetic-acid (TE)-buffer. The TE-buffer was analyzed using quantitative Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (qPCR), yielding calibration curves of total numbers of bacteria versus finger-chewed in. Next, five volunteers were requested to chew gum up to 10 min after which numbers of colony-forming-units and total numbers of bacteria trapped in chewed gum were determined using the above methods. The qPCR method, involving both dead and live bacteria yielded higher numbers of retrieved bacteria than plating, involving only viable bacteria. Numbers of trapped bacteria were maximal during initial chewing after which a slow decrease over time up to 10 min was observed. Around 108 bacteria were detected per gum piece depending on the method and gum considered. The number of species trapped in chewed gum increased with chewing time. Trapped bacteria were clearly visualized in chewed gum using scanning-electron-microscopy. Summarizing, using novel methods to quantify and qualify oral bacteria trapped in chewed gum, the hypothesis is confirmed that chewing of gum can trap and remove bacteria from the oral cavity."
https://openalex.org/W2074246238,"The prognosis of the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence following curative hepatectomy is usually dismal. Whether preoperative serum C-reactive protein (CRP) can predict the recurrence of HCC in patients with chronic HBV infection is not clear. Total 232 patients with chronic HBV infection were included in this retrospective study. We investigated the association between detailed preoperative serum CRP levels and early (â‰¤ 2 year) and late (> 2 year) HCC recurrence following curative hepatectomy. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found a saturation effect for preoperative serum CRP of 2.1 mg/dl existed for early HCC recurrence (ER). The incidence of ER increased with preoperative serum CRP less than 2.1 mg/dl (OR = 3.5, 95% CI 1.6â€“7.6, P = 0.001), and higher preoperative serum CRP (>2.1 mg/dl) did not increase the incidence of ER (OR = 0.8, 95% CI 0.2â€“2.7, P = 0.703). Whereas there is a linear relationship between preoperative serum CRP and late HCC recurrence (LR) (OR = 0.2, 95% CI, 0.1- 0.4) (OR = 1.8, 95% CI, 1.2â€“2.5, P = 0.002). In addition, the optimal cutoff point for serum CRP level was 1.5 mg/dl, instead of 1.0 mg/dl, in predicting both ER and LR. Patients with higher preoperative serum CRP level (>1.5 mg/dl) had lower recurrence free survival rates and overall survival rates (P<0.01). These results suggest that preoperative serum CRP played different roles on ER and LR following curative hepatectomy, thus further predictingthe prognosis in patients with chronic HBV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2002155395,"The functional properties of inositol(1,4,5)-triphosphate (IP3) receptors allow a variety of intracellular Ca2+ phenomena. In this way, global phenomena, such as propagating and abortive Ca2+ waves, as well as local events such as puffs, have been observed. Several experimental studies suggest that many features of global phenomena (e.g., frequency, amplitude, speed wave) depend on the interplay of biophysical processes such as diffusion, buffering, efflux and influx rates, which in turn depend on parameters such as buffer concentration, Ca2+ pump density, cytosolic IP3 level, and intercluster distance. Besides, it is known that cells are able to modify some of these parameters in order to regulate the Ca2+ signaling. By using a hybrid model, we analyzed different features of the hierarchy of calcium events as a function of two relevant parameters for the calcium signaling, the intercluster distance and the pump strength or intensity. In the space spanned by these two parameters, we found two modes of calcium dynamics, one dominated by abortive calcium waves and the other by propagating waves. Smaller distances between the release sites promote propagating calcium waves, while the increase of the efflux rate makes the transition from propagating to abortive waves occur at lower values of intercluster distance. We determined the frontier between these two modes, in the parameter space defined by the intercluster distance and the pump strength. Furthermore, we found that the velocity of simulated calcium waves accomplishes Lutherâ€™s law, and that an effective rate constant for autocatalytic calcium production decays linearly with both the intercluster distance and the pump strength."

https://openalex.org/W1976448562,"This paper presents a new automatic framework for extracting and characterizing the dynamic shape of the 3D wetting front and its propagation, based in a sequence of tomographic images acquired as water (moisture) infiltrates in unsaturated soils. To the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, the shape of the 3D wetting front and its propagation and progress over time has not been previously produced as a whole by methods in existing literature. The proposed automatic framework is composed two important and integrated modules: i) extraction of the 3D wetting front, and ii) characterization and description of the 3D wetting front to obtain important information about infiltration process. The 3D wetting front surface is segmented from 3D CT imagery provided as input via a 3D stochastic region merging strategy using quadric-regressed bilateral space-scale representations. Based on the 3D segmentation results, the normal directions at local curvature maxima of the wetting front surface are computed for 3D images of soil moisture, and its propagation is analyzed at the local directions in sites of maximal water adsorption, and described using histograms of curvature changes over time in response to sample saturation. These curvature change descriptors provide indirect measurements of moisture infiltration in soils, and soil saturation. Results using a field tomograph equipment specific for soil studies are encouraging, and suggest that the proposed automatic framework can be applied to estimate the infiltration of water in soils in 3D and in time."
