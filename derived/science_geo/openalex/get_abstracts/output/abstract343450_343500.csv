https://openalex.org/W2052714487,"Deuterium on Mars has been detected by the resolution of several Doppler-shifted lines ofHDO near 3.7 micrometers in the planet's spectrum. The ratio of deuterium to hydrogen is (9 +/- 4) x 10(-4); the abundance of H(2)0 was derived from lines near 1.1 micrometers. This ratio is enriched on Mars over the teiluric value by a factor of6 +/- 3. The enrichment implies that hydrogen escaped more rapidly from Mars in the past than it does now, consistent with a dense and warm ancient atmosphere on the planet."
https://openalex.org/W1975377962,"Mate recognition in frogs requires congruence of call characters, such as dominant frequency, and properties of the auditory system, such as frequency sensitivity of inner ear organs. Two neighboring populations of cricket frogs (Acris crepitans) exhibit statistically significant differences in the dominant frequency of the advertisement call and the frequency to which the basilar papilla of the inner ear is most sensitive. Call frequency and frequency sensitivity are matched within but differ between populations. These characters usually are negatively correlated with body size, and thus their congruence and coevolution often is explained by pleiotropic effects of size. However, within this species call frequency and frequency sensitivity of the basilar papilla evolved independent of body size, yielding local mate preferences that could contribute to genetic differentiation among neighboring populations."

https://openalex.org/W2046953059,"The Agulhas current, the major western boundary current of the Southern Hemisphere, plays a crucial role in the water mass balance ofthe world oceans by controlling the transfer of thernocline water from the Indian to the Atlantic ocean systems. The main mechanism for such transfer is through the shedding of large rings of warm water at the Agulhas retroflection south ofAfrica. On the basis ofsatellite imagery and drifter tracks, anomalous reversals ofthe current are observed to occur far upstream of its characteristic retroflection location. The observations agree with results of an inertial jet model ofthe current. These anomalous reversals probably cause abrupt and major changes in the fluxes south ofAfrica and thus in the rate of ring shedding. This unusual flow bimodality in a major component of the global ocean heat transport system could have important climatic implications."

Both data sets were identically sampled and smoothed with an 85-day running mean, and the ACRIM total solar irradiance (S) values were corrected for sunspot blocking (Sc). The strength of the mid-photospheric manganese 539.4-nanometer line tracks almost perfectly with ACRIM Sc, Other spectral features formed high in the photosphere and chromosphere also track well. These comparisons independently confirm the variability in the ACRIM Sc, signal, indicate that the source of irradiance is faculae, and indicate that ACRIM Sc, follows the 11-year activity cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2044457125,"The fossil record of shallow marine organisms in the Hawaiian Archipelago and Emperor seamount chain indicates that reef corals were absent during the first half of the Tertiary. Their appearance during the early Oligocene, 34 million years ago, is associated with several paleoceanographic events that appear to have combined to intensify gradually gyral surface currents in the north Pacific. This association suggests that corals were absent in the early Tertiary because of isolation of the Hawaiian Archipelago from the Indo-West Pacific (IWP), the center of reef coral abundance and diversity in the Pacific. Today, the number of species of reef corals in Hawaii is less than 10 percent of the number of species in the IWP. Since their initial colonization, reef corals have been present continuously in the Hawaiian Archipelago, although not without taxonomic change. Episodes of extinction and recolonization are the most likely cause of change in species composition. Recolonization from the IWP may also explain the low rate of endemism (about 20 percent) in the present-day coral fauna."

This ""Solnhofen specimen"" is the largest of now six skeletal specimens and shows dose similarities with the London specimen. It is therefore assigned to Archaeopteryx lithographica Meyer. Clear impressions of the feather shafts of the left wing are preserved."

https://openalex.org/W2038884548,"Analysis of the chemical and isotopic composition of stellar surfaces reveals the types of nuclear reactions that have occurred in the stellar interiors as well as the timing and depths from which material once deep in the star has reached the surface. Mass loss from the stellar surface and, in some cases, mass transfer from a companion enhance the opportunity to observe material that is the product of internal nuclear reactions. Detailed studies show substantial deficiencies in current models with the timing and depth of convective and other forms of mixing."
