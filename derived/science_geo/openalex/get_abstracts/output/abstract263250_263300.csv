https://openalex.org/W1973622869,"The maintenance of homeostasis throughout an organism's life span requires constant adaptation to changes in energy levels. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a critical role in the cellular responses to low energy levels by switching off energy-consuming pathways and switching on energy-producing pathways. However, the transcriptional mechanisms by which AMPK acts to adjust cellular energy levels are not entirely characterized. Here, we find that AMPK directly regulates mammalian FOXO3, a member of the FOXO family of Forkhead transcription factors known to promote resistance to oxidative stress, tumor suppression, and longevity. We show that AMPK phosphorylates human FOXO3 at six previously unidentified regulatory sites. Phosphorylation by AMPK leads to the activation of FOXO3 transcriptional activity without affecting FOXO3 subcellular localization. Using a genome-wide microarray analysis, we identify a set of target genes that are regulated by FOXO3 when phosphorylated at these six regulatory sites in mammalian cells. The regulation of FOXO3 by AMPK may play a crucial role in fine tuning gene expression programs that control energy balance and stress resistance in cells throughout life.

The maintenance of cellular energy levels in response to changes in nutrient availability, exercise, or stress stimuli is pivotal for organismal homeostasis throughout life. Disruption of this balance is associated with a number of pathologies, including diabetes and cancer.

AMPK is a heterotrimeric protein kinase composed of three subunits: a catalytic subunit (α), a scaffolding subunit (β), and an AMP-sensing subunit (γ). AMPK is activated by stimuli that increase the AMP/ATP ratio in cells. Excess AMP activates AMPK by inhibiting the dephosphorylation of the α catalytic subunit (3Sanders M.J. Grondin P.O.

Thus, identifying novel AMPK substrates is important to understand how the LKB1-AMPK pathway mediates its effects in the organism. FOXO transcription factors are good candidates to be regulated by AMPK.

In response to insulin and growth factors, AKT phosphorylates FOXO proteins, thereby sequestering them in the cytoplasm and inhibiting their function (30Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z.

Stimuli that activate AMPK have been reported to inhibit FOXO1-dependent transcription (38Barthel A. Schmoll D. Kruger K.D. Roth R.A. Joost H.G. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3183-3186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, whether FOXO family members are direct substrates of AMPK and how they mediate the effects of AMPK on gene expression is not known. Here, we show that the energy-sensing AMPK directly phosphorylates human FOXO3 at six previously unidentified residues in vitro. At least three of these sites are phosphorylated in mammalian cells in response to stimuli that activate AMPK. AMPK is necessary and sufficient for the phosphorylation of FOXO3 at these sites in cells. We show that mutating the AMPK phosphorylation sites of FOXO3 impairs FOXO3-dependent transcription but does not affect FOXO3 localization. A genome-wide microarray analysis indicates that mutation of AMPK phosphorylation sites in FOXO3 specifically impairs the expression of a subset of target genes, including oxidative stress resistance and energy metabolism genes. We identify a connection between the AMPK pathway and FOXO3 that may play an important role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Constructs—GST-FOXO3 bacterial expression constructs, FLAG-FOXO3 mammalian expression constructs, and retroviral constructs were described previously (30Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z.

S439A, S555A, S588A, and S626A) in the pGEX-4T3, the pECE, and the NH2 vectors were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene), using the following sets of primers: T179A-F (CGGACAAACGGCTAGCTCTGTCCCAGATC), T179A-R (GATCTGGGACAGAGCTAGCCGTTTGTCCG), S399A-F (CACGCTCCCGCCGGCCCAGCCATCGCCC), S399A-R (GGGCGATGGCTGGGCCGGCGGGAGCGTG), S413A-F (CATGCAGCGGAGCTCAGCTTTCCCGTATACC), S413A-R (GGTATACGGGAAAGCTGAGCTCCGCTGCATG), S439A-F (GGTGTTCGGACCTTCAGCTCTGAATTCCCTACGCCAGTCTCC), S439A-R (GGAGACTGGCGTAGGGAATTCAGAGCTGAAGGTCCGAACACC), S555A-F (CCTTGTCGAATTCTGTCGCCAACATGGGCTTGAG), S555A-R (CTCAAGCCCATGTTGGCGACAGAATTCGACAAGG), S588A-F (CCTCTCGGACTCTCTCGCAGGATCCTCCTTGTACTC), S588A-R (GAGTACAAGGAGGATCCTGCGAGAGAGTCCGAGAGG); S626A-F (GGAATGTGACATGGAGGCCATTATCCGTAG), S626A-R (CTACGGATAATGGCCTCCATGTCACATTCC). GST-SIRT1, GST-FOXO1, GST-FOXO4, and GST-FOXO6 bacterial expression constructs were created by subcloning the human cDNA (SIRT1, FOXO1, and FOXO4) or mouse cDNA (FOXO6) into the pGEX-4T3 vector in frame with GST. The mutations and flanking regions were verified by sequencing. Human AMPK β1 and γ1 expression plasmids were obtained from Origene. Human AMPKα2 WT cDNA (Origene) was subcloned into the pECE mammalian expression vector in frame with the FLAG epitope. CA AMPK α2 was generated by truncating AMPK α2 cDNA at the position corresponding to amino acid 310, as previously described (39Milan D. Jeon J.T. Looft C. Amarger V. Robic A. Thelander M. Rogel-Gaillard C. Paul S. Iannuccelli N. Rask L. Ronne H. Lundstrom K. Reinsch N. Gellin J. Kalm E. Roy P.L. Chardon P. Andersson L.

Dominant negative (DN) AMPK α2 K45R mutant was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the following primers: K45R-F (CCATAAAGTGGCAGTTAGAATCTTAAATAGAC) and K45R-R (GTCTATTTAAGATTCTAACTGCCACTTTATGG). Antibodies and Reagents—The antibodies to β-actin and FLAG epitope were obtained from Novus Biologicals and Sigma, respectively. The antibodies to phospho-Ser413 and total FOXO3 were described previously (36Brunet A. Sweeney L.B. Sturgill J.F. Chua K.F. Greer P.L. Lin Y. Tran H. Ross S.E. Mostoslavsky R. Cohen H.Y. Hu L.S.

The antibodies to the C-terminal region of FOXO3 were generated by injection of a fusion protein between GST and amino acids 497–601 of mouse Foxo3 into rabbits, and the antibodies were purified by affinity (Quality Controlled Biochemicals). Phosphopeptides of the sequences p-T179 (CESSPDKRLpTLSQI), p-S399 (CLDNITLPPpSQPSP), p-S555 (CSRALSNSVpSNMGL), p-S588 (CMQTLSDSLpSGSSL), and p-S626 (CGSLECDMEpSIIRS) were coupled to KLH and injected into rabbits, and the phosphoantibodies were purified by affinity (Quality Controlled Biochemicals for P-S399, P-555, and P-S588; Covance for P-179, P-588, and P-S626). Unless otherwise stated, chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Compound C was a generous gift from Dr. Gaochao Zhou (40Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T.

AMPK in Vitro Kinase Assay—Purified AMPK (Upstate Biotechnology) was incubated with various substrates (1 μg) in the kinase reaction buffer (HEPES, pH 7.0 (15 mm), dithiothreitol (450 μm), MgCl2 (18.75 mm), β-glycerophosphate (6.25 mm), EGTA (1.25 mm), and ATP (125 μm)) and 12.5 μCi of radiolabeled ATP, with or without 150 μm AMP, at 30 °C for 15 min. Phosphorylation was detected by incorporation of radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP. Quantifications were performed using the Amersham Biosciences Storm PhosphorImager and ImageQuant 5.2 software. Immunoblotting—The 293T human epithelial kidney cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 265 μg/ml streptomycin). 293T cells were seeded in 6-well plastic dishes at a density of 7 × 105 cells/well. They were transfected by the calcium phosphate technique with 5 μg of the constructs of interest. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 3 h and stimulated with various AMPK activators. Extracts were obtained by lysing the cells in lysis buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (50 mm), NaCl (100 mm), EGTA (2 mm), NaF (10 mm), β-glycerophosphate (40 mm), Triton X-100 (0.4%), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm)). Protein extracts were resolved on SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies, and the primary antibody was visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—293T cells were seeded in a 10-cm dish at 3.5 × 106 cells/dish. 24 h later, protein extracts from four dishes were pooled and incubated with the C-terminal antibody to FOXO3 chemically coupled to agarose beads using the Profound™ co-immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce). The immune complexes were washed three times in the wash buffer (Pierce), and the proteins were eluted from the beads using the elution buffer (Pierce). Immunocytochemistry—293T cells were seeded in 12-well plastic dishes on coverslips at a density of 3.5 × 105 cells/well. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate technique with 2.5 μg of the constructs of interest. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100. Coverslips were incubated with the FLAG antibody (1:2000; Sigma) and the Alexa Fluoro 488 goat anti-mouse antibody. Coverslips were mounted in Aquamount and examined under epifluorescent illumination. FOXO3 subcellular localization was examined in 300 cells in a blinded manner. Tandem Mass Spectrometry—A Coomassie-stained band corresponding to GST-FOXO3 phosphorylated by AMPK was excised from an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, divided in half, reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with either trypsin or chymotrypsin. Peptide mixtures were separated by microcapillary reverse-phase chromatography and analyzed online in a hybrid linear ion trap-Orbitrap (LTQ-Orbitrap; Thermo Electron) mass spectrometer. Mass spectra were data base-searched using the SEQUEST algorithm. All peptide matches were initially filtered based on enzyme specificity, mass measurement error, Xcorr and ΔCorr′ scores and further manually validated for peptide identification and site localization. Luciferase Reporter Assay—WT mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), prepared from embryonic day 13.5 embryos from CD1 WT mice, were seeded at 35,000 cells/well in 24-well plates and were transfected with 200 ng of FOXO3 plasmids together with 200 ng of a luciferase reporter construct driven by six tandem repeats of DAF-16/FOXO binding elements (6 × DBE-Luciferase) (41Furuyama T. Nakazawa T. Nakano I. Mori N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) and 200 ng of a Renilla luciferase reporter construct driven by the thymidine kinase promoter (TK-Renilla) using Fugene (Roche Applied Science). 48 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with appropriate stimuli, and luciferase and Renilla activities were measured using the STOP and GLOW kit (Promega) using the manufacturer's protocol. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The forward (AAATAACACACACGTGTGCTGGTAAACAAGCGCGCCAGCC) and reverse (GGCTGGCGCGCTTGTTTACCAGCACACGTGTGTGTTATTT) oligonucleotides corresponding to the FOXO canonical binding site (DBE) were annealed and labeled with polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [32P]ATP for 30 min. The double-stranded probe was purified from a 15% native gel. 16,000 cpm of labeled probes were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 100–500 ng of recombinant protein and 6 μg of salmon sperm DNA in electrophoretic mobility shift assay binding buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (50 mm), KCl (250 mm), dithiothreitol (5 mm), MgCl2 (25 mm), glycerol (50%), and Nonidet P-40 (0.25%)). The reactions were then resolved by electrophoresis on 4% native acrylamide gels. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. Retroviral Infection—Foxo3-/- primary MEFs were prepared from embryonic day 13.5 embryos from Foxo3-/- mice (FVB/N background). For retroviral infection, 293T cells were co-transfected with the retroviral constructs of interest together with plasmids encoding the Gag, Pol, and Env proteins of the MLV retrovirus. 20 h after transfection, 0.45-μm filtered conditioned medium from infected 293T cells was added onto Foxo3-/- MEF cells in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide; Sigma). Three successive rounds of infections were performed at 12-h intervals, and the infected cells were selected for their resistance to G418 (Invitrogen) for 1 week. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 3 × 105 cells/well and stimulated as described. RNA was extracted using Trizol following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Quantitative RT-PCR—The expression of mouse Gadd45a, Aldh3a1, and Mt1 were determined by reverse transcription of total RNA, followed by quantitative PCR analysis. One μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with random hexamers using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real time PCR was performed on a Bio-Rad iCycler using iQ SYBR green (Bio-Rad) with the following primers: Aldh3a1 F, AGACATCAAGCGGTGGAGTGA; Aldh3a1 R, CGAAGCTTTTCTTGCCATGG; Mt1 F, ATCTCGGAATGGACCCCAACT; Mt1 R, TATTTACACGTGGTGGCAGCG; Gadd45a F, AGCAAGGCTCGGAGTCAGC; Gadd45a R, ACGTTGAGCAGCTTGGCAG; β-actin F, TGTTACCAACTGGGACGACA; β-actin R, TCTCAGCTGTGGTGGTGAAG; Rab39b F, GGAAAACGCATCAAGCTCCA; Rab39b R, AAGGACCTGCGGTTGGTAATG; Ucp2 F, CCCAGCCTACAGATGTGGTAA; Ucp2 R, GAGGTTGGCTTTCAGGAGAGT; Pgc1a F, AGCGCCGTGTGATTTACGTT; Pgc1a R, CCGCAGATTTACGGTGCATT; Slc40a1 F, TTCCGCACTTTCCGAGATG; Slc40a1 R, AGTCAAAGCCCAGGACTGTCA; Atp6v0d2 F, CAAGCCTTTGTTTGACGCTGT; Atp6v0d2 R, TGCCTGTTGAATGCCAGCA. The experiments were conducted in triplicate, and the results were expressed as 2(-(Gene of interest number of cycles - actin number of cycles)). Control PCRs were also performed on total RNA that had not been reverse-transcribed to test for the presence of genomic DNA in the RNA preparation. The specificity of the products of the quantitative RT-PCR reactions was verified on 2% agarose gels. Genome-wide Microarray Analysis—Foxo3-/- MEFs expressing either WT FOXO3 or the 6A mutant constructs were left unstimulated, or duplicates were incubated in serum-free media in the presence of 2-deoxyglucose (2DG; 1 mm) for 8 h. RNA was extracted by Trizol extraction and was checked for integrity and quantity with the Agilent Bio-Analyzer QC. Microarray hybridization was performed at the Stanford PAN facility. Briefly, RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA, followed by in vitro transcription and biotinylation. Biotinylated cRNAs were then fragmented, mixed with control cRNA fragments, and hybridized to Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays (Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array). Microarray results were normalized across all probe sets, such that the mean signal of each experiment is normalized to the mean signal of the base line for all probe sets with GCOS (GeneChip Operating Software) from Affymetrix so that changes in gene expression could be compared across different samples. Normalized data were subsequently filtered using the following parameters. 1) A probe was removed if normalized values for that particular probe were missing in greater than 20% of the samples (to ensure that each probe was placed in the proper cluster). 2) A probe was removed if the S.D. value of the normalized values across individual conditions tested in the microarray (WT nonstimulated, 6A nonstimulated, WT stimulated by nutrient deprivation 1, WT stimulated by nutrient deprivation 2, 6A stimulated by nutrient deprivation 1, and 6A stimulated by nutrient deprivation 2) was less than 2.0 (to ensure that only genes whose expression changes significantly were compared). 3) A probe was removed if it did not display an absolute normalized value greater than 20 in at least four samples, as in Ref. 42Tamayo P. Slonim D. Mesirov J. Zhu Q. Kitareewan S. Dmitrovsky E. Lander E.S. Golub T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Data were then log-transformed to ensure that negative-fold changes were given equal importance as positive-fold changes. Finally, a complete linkage hierarchical clustering was performed using Gene Cluster 3.0 (43Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

AMPK Directly Phosphorylates FOXO Transcription Factors in Vitro—To determine if AMPK directly phosphorylated FOXO transcription factors, we performed in vitro kinase assays using purified AMPK and bacterially expressed forms of GST-FOXO fusion proteins as substrates. We found that AMPK directly phosphorylated mammalian FOXO3 and that the phosphorylation of FOXO3 by AMPK was greatly enhanced by the presence of AMP (Fig. 1A). This result indicates that the purified kinase responsible for FOXO3 phosphorylation is AMP-dependent. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation of FOXO3 by AMPK was higher than that of SAMS, a 15-amino acid peptide containing a known AMPK phosphorylation site (45Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B), suggesting that FOXO3 is a good in vitro substrate of AMPK. AMPK also phosphorylated the other FOXO family members (FOXO1, FOXO4, and FOXO6) but displayed a strong preference toward FOXO3 (Fig. 1C). In contrast, AMPK did not phosphorylate GST alone (Fig. 1A), the small GTPase RAC1 (data not shown), or the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 (Fig. 1D), indicating that even in vitro, AMPK displays some specificity toward FOXO transcription factors. Together, these results show that AMPK potently phosphorylates FOXO3 in vitro. AMPK Phosphorylates FOXO3 at Six Previously Unidentified Residues—We next sought to determine the residues of FOXO3 that were phosphorylated by AMPK. Scanning of FOXO3 protein sequence revealed the presence of six sites that conform to varying degrees to the consensus motif phosphorylated by AMPK (amphipathic helix; ϕXβXX(S/T)XXXϕ, where ϕ represents a hydrophobic residue and β represents a basic residue) (46Weekes J.

https://openalex.org/W2115571765,"Background Migratory animals comprise a significant portion of biodiversity worldwide with annual investment for their conservation exceeding several billion dollars. Designing effective conservation plans presents enormous challenges. Migratory species are influenced by multiple events across land and sea–regions that are often separated by thousands of kilometres and span international borders. To date, conservation strategies for migratory species fail to take into account how migratory animals are spatially connected between different periods of the annual cycle (i.e. migratory connectivity) bringing into question the utility and efficiency of current conservation efforts. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we report the first framework for determining an optimal conservation strategy for a migratory species. Employing a decision theoretic approach using dynamic optimization, we address the problem of how to allocate resources for habitat conservation for a Neotropical-Nearctic migratory bird, the American redstart Setophaga ruticilla, whose winter habitat is under threat. Our first conservation strategy used the acquisition of winter habitat based on land cost, relative bird density, and the rate of habitat loss to maximize the abundance of birds on the wintering grounds. Our second strategy maximized bird abundance across the entire range of the species by adding the constraint of maintaining a minimum percentage of birds within each breeding region in North America using information on migratory connectivity as estimated from stable-hydrogen isotopes in feathers. We show that failure to take into account migratory connectivity may doom some regional populations to extinction, whereas including information on migratory connectivity results in the protection of the species across its entire range. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrate that conservation strategies for migratory animals depend critically upon two factors: knowledge of migratory connectivity and the correct statement of the conservation problem. Our framework can be used to identify efficient conservation strategies for migratory taxa worldwide, including insects, birds, mammals, and marine organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2161180155,"Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a potent signal to the host immune system for the presence of an ongoing viral infection. The presence of dsRNA, intracellularly or extracellularly, leads to the induction of innate inflammatory cytokines in many cell types including epithelial cells. However, the cell surface receptor for recognition of extracellular dsRNA is not yet determined. Here, we report that extracellular dsRNA is recognized and internalized by scavenger receptor class-A (SR-A). Treatment of human epithelial cells with specific antagonists of SR-A or with an anti-SR-A antibody significantly inhibited dsRNA induction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). Furthermore, intranasal dsRNA treatment of SR-A-deficient (SR-A(-/-)) mice showed a significant decrease in the expression of inflammatory cytokines and a corresponding decrease in the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in lungs. These data provide direct evidence that SR-A is a novel cell surface receptor for dsRNA, and therefore, SR-A may play a role in antiviral immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2166366540,"Sexual behavior requires animals to distinguish between the sexes and to respond appropriately to each of them. In Drosophila melanogaster, as in many insects, cuticular hydrocarbons are thought to be involved in sex recognition and in mating behavior, but there is no direct neuronal evidence of their pheromonal effect. Using behavioral and electrophysiological measures of responses to natural and synthetic compounds, we show that Z-7-tricosene, a Drosophila male cuticular hydrocarbon, acts as a sex pheromone and inhibits male-male courtship. These data provide the first direct demonstration that an insect cuticular hydrocarbon is detected as a sex pheromone. Intriguingly, we show that a particular type of gustatory neurons of the labial palps respond both to Z-7-tricosene and to bitter stimuli. Cross-adaptation between Z-7-tricosene and bitter stimuli further indicates that these two very different substances are processed by the same neural pathways. Furthermore, the two substances induced similar behavioral responses both in courtship and feeding tests. We conclude that the inhibitory pheromone tastes bitter to the fly."
https://openalex.org/W2110030028,"The genetic benefits of mate choice are limited by the degree to which male and female fitness are genetically correlated. If the intersexual correlation for fitness is small or negative, choosing a highly fit mate does not necessarily result in high fitness offspring.Using an animal-model approach on data from a pedigreed population of over 7,000 collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis), we estimate the intersexual genetic correlation in Lifetime Reproductive Success (LRS) in a natural population to be negative in sign (-0.85+/-0.6). Simulations show this estimate to be robust in sign to the effects of extra-pair parentage. The genetic benefits in this population are further limited by a low level of genetic variation for fitness in males.The potential for indirect sexual selection is nullified by sexual antagonistic fitness effects in this natural population. Our findings and the scarce evidence from other studies suggest that the intersexual genetic correlation for lifetime fitness may be very low in nature. We argue that this form of conflict can, in general, both constrain and maintain sexual selection, depending on the sex-specific additive genetic variances in lifetime fitness."
https://openalex.org/W2125477089,"The hallmark of eukaryotic cells is their segregation of key biological functions into discrete, membrane-bound organelles. Creating accurate models of their ultrastructural complexity has been difficult in part because of the limited resolution of light microscopy and the artifact-prone nature of conventional electron microscopy. Here we explored the potential of the emerging technology electron cryotomography to produce three-dimensional images of an entire eukaryotic cell in a near-native state. Ostreococcus tauri was chosen as the specimen because as a unicellular picoplankton with just one copy of each organelle, it is the smallest known eukaryote and was therefore likely to yield the highest resolution images. Whole cells were imaged at various stages of the cell cycle, yielding 3-D reconstructions of complete chloroplasts, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticula, Golgi bodies, peroxisomes, microtubules, and putative ribosome distributions in-situ. Surprisingly, the nucleus was seen to open long before mitosis, and while one microtubule (or two in some predivisional cells) was consistently present, no mitotic spindle was ever observed, prompting speculation that a single microtubule might be sufficient to segregate multiple chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2113698201,"The evolutionary transition of fins to limbs involved development of a new suite of distal skeletal structures, the digits. During tetrapod limb development, genes at the 5' end of the HoxD cluster are expressed in two spatiotemporally distinct phases. In the first phase, Hoxd9-13 are activated sequentially and form nested domains along the anteroposterior axis of the limb. This initial phase patterns the limb from its proximal limit to the middle of the forearm. Later in development, a second wave of transcription results in 5' HoxD gene expression along the distal end of the limb bud, which regulates formation of digits. Studies of zebrafish fins showed that the second phase of Hox expression does not occur, leading to the idea that the origin of digits was driven by addition of the distal Hox expression domain in the earliest tetrapods. Here we test this hypothesis by investigating Hoxd gene expression during paired fin development in the shark Scyliorhinus canicula, a member of the most basal lineage of jawed vertebrates. We report that at early stages, 5'Hoxd genes are expressed in anteroposteriorly nested patterns, consistent with the initial wave of Hoxd transcription in teleost and tetrapod paired appendages. Unexpectedly, a second phase of expression occurs at later stages of shark fin development, in which Hoxd12 and Hoxd13 are re-expressed along the distal margin of the fin buds. This second phase is similar to that observed in tetrapod limbs. The results indicate that a second, distal phase of Hoxd gene expression is not uniquely associated with tetrapod digit development, but is more likely a plesiomorphic condition present the common ancestor of chondrichthyans and osteichthyans. We propose that a temporal extension, rather than de novo activation, of Hoxd expression in the distal part of the fin may have led to the evolution of digits."
https://openalex.org/W2080777209,"The chronological lifespan of eukaryotic organisms is extended by the mutational inactivation of conserved growth-signaling pathways that regulate progression into and through the cell cycle. Here we show that in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, these and other lifespan-extending conditions, including caloric restriction and osmotic stress, increase the efficiency with which nutrient-depleted cells establish or maintain a cell cycle arrest in G1. Proteins required for efficient G1 arrest and longevity when nutrients are limiting include the DNA replication stress response proteins Mec1 and Rad53. Ectopic expression of CLN3 encoding a G1 cyclin downregulated during nutrient depletion increases the frequency with which nutrient depleted cells arrest growth in S phase instead of G1. Ectopic expression of CLN3 also shortens chronological lifespan in concert with age-dependent increases in genome instability and apoptosis. These findings indicate that replication stress is an important determinant of chronological lifespan in budding yeast. Protection from replication stress by growth-inhibitory effects of caloric restriction, osmotic and other stresses may contribute to hormesis effects on lifespan. Replication stress also likely impacts the longevity of higher eukaryotes, including humans."
https://openalex.org/W2014085508,"Background The haplochromine cichlid species assemblages of Lake Malawi and Victoria represent some of the most important study systems in evolutionary biology. Identifying adaptive divergence between closely-related species can provide important insights into the processes that may have contributed to these spectacular radiations. Here, we studied a pair of sympatric Lake Malawi species, Pseudotropheus fainzilberi and P. emmiltos, whose reproductive isolation depends on olfactory communication. We tested the hypothesis that these species have undergone divergent selection at MHC class II genes, which are known to contribute to olfactory-based mate choice in other taxa. Methodology/Principal Findings Divergent selection on functional alleles was inferred from the higher genetic divergence at putative antigen binding sites (ABS) amino acid sequences than at putatively neutrally evolving sites at intron 1, exon 2 synonymous sequences and exon 2 amino acid residues outside the putative ABS. In addition, sympatric populations of these fish species differed significantly in communities of eukaryotic parasites. Conclusions/Significance We propose that local host-parasite coevolutionary dynamics may have driven adaptive divergence in MHC alleles, influencing odor-mediated mate choice and leading to reproductive isolation. These results provide the first evidence for a novel mechanism of adaptive speciation and the first evidence of adaptive divergence at the MHC in closely related African cichlid fishes."
https://openalex.org/W2014374622,"It is well known that simultaneous presentation of incongruent audio and visual stimuli can lead to illusory percepts. Recent data suggest that distinct processes underlie non-specific intersensory speech as opposed to non-speech perception. However, the development of both speech and non-speech intersensory perception across childhood and adolescence remains poorly defined. Thirty-eight observers aged 5 to 19 were tested on the McGurk effect (an audio-visual illusion involving speech), the Illusory Flash effect and the Fusion effect (two audio-visual illusions not involving speech) to investigate the development of audio-visual interactions and contrast speech vs. non-speech developmental patterns. Whereas the strength of audio-visual speech illusions varied as a direct function of maturational level, performance on non-speech illusory tasks appeared to be homogeneous across all ages. These data support the existence of independent maturational processes underlying speech and non-speech audio-visual illusory effects."
https://openalex.org/W2067262661,"The ability of bacteria to evolve resistance to antibiotics has been much reported in recent years. It is less well-known that within populations of bacteria there are cells which are resistant due to a non-inherited phenotypic switch to a slow-growing state. Although such ‘persister’ cells are receiving increasing attention, the evolutionary forces involved have been relatively ignored. Persistence has a direct benefit to cells because it allows survival during catastrophes–a form of bet-hedging. However, persistence can also provide an indirect benefit to other individuals, because the reduced growth rate can reduce competition for limiting resources. This raises the possibility that persistence is a social trait, which can be influenced by kin selection. We develop a theoretical model to investigate the social consequences of persistence. We predict that selection for persistence is increased when: (a) cells are related (e.g. a single, clonal lineage); and (b) resources are scarce. Our model allows us to predict how the level of persistence should vary with time, across populations, in response to intervention strategies and the level of competition. More generally, our results clarify the links between persistence and other bet-hedging or social behaviours."

The structure of GPI is well conserved among eukaryotes. More than 150 GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) with various functions have been identified, including complement system regulatory factors (CD55 and CD59), enzymes (acetylcholinesterase, alkaline phosphatase, and others), adhesion molecules (CD48, neural cell adhesion molecule, and others), and receptors for signal transduction (lipopolysaccharide receptor, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, folate receptor, and others) (3Ikezawa H.

The GPI anchor is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), consisting of ethanolamine phosphate, three mannoses, glucosamine, and phosphatidylinositol (3Ikezawa H. Biol. Pharm.

Phosphatidylinositol glycan A is the enzyme involved in the early step of GPI synthesis, and its disruption in mice causes complete loss of GPI synthesis resulting in embryonic lethality with defective gastrulation and neural development indicating the importance of GPI-APs for normal development (7Nozaki M. Ohishi K. Yamada N. Kinoshita T. Nagy A. Takeda J. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 293-299PubMed Google Scholar). At an early step, the inositol ring of GPI is acylated with a palmitoyl chain by phosphatidylinositol glycan W (8Murakami Y. Siripanyapinyo U. Hong Y. Kang J.Y. Ishihara S. Nakakuma H. Maeda Y.

This inositol acylation is indispensable for the attachment of ethanolamine phosphate to the third mannose of GPI intermediates, and phosphatidylinositol glycan W-defective mutant cells express very low levels of GPI-APs (8Murakami Y.

To clarify the physiological role of this deacylation, we generated PGAP1 knock-out mice. Generation of PGAP1-deficient Mice—The targeting vector for deletion of PGAP1 exon 5 contains an expression cassette of the neomycin resistance gene (neo) for positive selection and diphtheria toxin for negative selection. The target vector was linearized by digestion with Asc-I and electroporated into mouse D3 embryonic stem cells. Homologous recombinants were selected using G418, PCR, and Southern blotting and were injected into C57BL/6 mouse blastocysts. PCR for the first embryonic stem cell screening was performed using primer1 (5′-TAgCCTggAggACAACAgATACTCAT-3′) and primer2 (5′-gTTATTCggTCCCTCgAATAggTTCA-3′). Chimeric male mice were crossed with C57BL/6 J female mice (CLEA Japan, Inc., Tokyo) to establish heterozygous mutant lines.

The probe B was generated by PCR using the set of primer A (5′-gAggCgCgCCAAgAAgTAggggTgTAgAggTTggT-3′) and primer B (5′-gTTTATgATgAgTATCTgTTgTCCTC-3′), and the probe N was generated by PCR using the set of primer C (5′-ACTggAACACTTTTgTgACATgggAA-3′) and primer D (5′-ATAAggCACTggTgTAATggCTCAAT-3′). PI-PLC Assay—White blood cells derived from 300 μl of peripheral blood were diluted with 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 unit/ml PI-PLC (Molecular Probes) and 0.02 m HEPES buffer (Sigma). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the cells were subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. The antibodies used were allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-mouse CD4 (RM4–5), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse CD8α(Ly-2), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse CD45R/B220 (RA3–6B2), allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-mouse T cell receptor β chain (H57–597) and phycoerythrin-conjugated Armenian hamster anti-mouse CD48 (BCM1, HM48-1, IgG1, and lamda3, all from BD Pharmingen). Phycoerythrin-conjugated Armenian hamster IgG1, lamda1 (anti-TNP, BD Pharmingen) was used as an isotype control for the phycoerythrin-conjugated Armenian hamster anti-mouse CD48. Data obtained by FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) were analyzed with FlowJo (TreeStar, Inc.). In Vivo Mating—Each experimental and control mouse was mated with 3 female BDF-1 mice for 8 weeks. The females were allowed to deliver the pups, which were counted after birth. The females that failed to become pregnant when mated with PGAP1–/– mice were later tested for fertility by mating with normal males. Sperm Migration Assay—Ascent of sperm from the uterus into oviduct was examined as described previously (19Ikawa M. Nakanishi T. Yamada S. Wada I. Kominami K. Tanaka H. Nozaki M. Nishimune Y. Okabe M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). B6DF1 female mice at 8 weeks of age were superovulated by intraperitoneal injection of 5 units of pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (Teikoku Zoki Co., Tokyo), followed by injection of 5 units of human chorionic gonadotropin (Teikoku Zoki Co.) 48 h later. Superovulated females were mated with PGAP1 mutant males of each genotype 12 h after human chorionic gonadotropin injection, and the formation of a vaginal plug was observed every 30 min. About 2 h after copulation, oviducts were excised with the connective part of the uterus, fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 6 h at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and frozen in OCT compound (Sakura Finetechnical Co., Tokyo) with liquid nitrogen. Sections were prepared, stained with hematoxylin, and then observed under a microscope. In Vitro Fertilization—The capacitation was induced in vitro by incubating sperm from PGAP1 homozygous mutant and wild-type littermates in TYH medium (modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution containing glucose, sodium pyruvate, bovine serum albumin, and antibiotics) (20Toyoda Y. Yokoyama M. Hoshi T. Jpn. J. Anim. Reprod. 1971; 16: 147-151Crossref Google Scholar). Ovulated egg masses from B6DF1 mice (>2 months old, Japan SLC, Inc., Shizuoka, Japan) were placed in a 200-μl drop of TYH medium. An aliquot of capacitated sperm (2 × 105 sperm/ml) was inseminated. The mixture was incubated for 8 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air (21Yamagata K. Nakanishi T. Ikawa M. Yamaguchi R. Moss S.B. Okabe M. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 348-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 60–80 eggs for each genotype were examined for fertility by pronuclei formation. For the sperm-zona binding assay, egg masses were treated with bovine testicular hyaluronidase (175 units/ml, Sigma) for 5 min to remove the cumulus cells. Cumulus-free eggs were placed in a 200-μl TYH drop and inseminated. After 30 min of incubation, sperm bound to the zona pellucida of the eggs were observed using an IX-70 microscope (Olympus). We did not differentiate the state of sperm on the zona pellucida, “attaching” and “binding,” so the eggs were observed without washing by pipetting. Antibodies—Affinity-purified rabbit anti-SPAM1 (PH-20) antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Tadashi Baba (University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan) (22Baba D. Kashiwabara S. Honda A. Yamagata K. Wu Q.

Monoclonal antibodies against mouse ADAM2 (9D2.2) and ADAM3 (7C1.2) were purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. Monoclonal antibody against tACE (1D5) was prepared as described (23Yamaguchi R. Yamagata K. Ikawa M. Moss S.B. Okabe M. Biol. Reprod. 2006; 75: 760-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). An Armenian hamster monoclonal antibody against mouse GPI-DAF (RIKO-4) was a kind gift from Drs. Hidechika Okada and Noriko Okada (Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan) (24Ohta R. Imai M. Fukuoka Y. Miwa T. Okada N. Okada H. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 43: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody against Izumo was prepared as described (25Inoue N. Ikawa M. Isotani A. Okabe M. Nature. 2005; 434: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). An antibody against CD59b was a kind gift from Dr. B. Paul Morgan (University of Wales College of Medicine, UK) (26Harris C.L. Hanna S.M. Mizuno M. Holt D.S. Marchbank K.J. Morgan B.P. Immunology. 2003; 109: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Preparation of Protein Extracts—Mice testes were washed with cold PBS, and their covering tunica albuginea were removed in cold PBS. Testicular tubes were further washed in PBS and homogenized in 25 volumes of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) using a Micro Multi Mixer (IEDA Trading Corp., Tokyo). The protein concentrations of homogenates of each sample were measured using a BCA™ Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) and adjusted appropriately. Mouse sperm were collected from the cauda epididymis and vas deferens, washed with 4 °C PBS once, and centrifuged at 810 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The pellet was lysed with the same lysis buffer, and the protein concentration was adjusted in the same manner as testes. Western Blotting—Protein extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove the insoluble protein and debris, and the supernatants were colleted. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (ADAM2, ADAM3, tACE, and Izumo) or non-reducing conditions (CD55, CD59b, SPAM-1, CD52) and transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with TBS-T buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% skim milk overnight, blots were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then washed with TBS-T buffer twice and incubated with the appropriate second antibodies. Detection of bands was performed using a Western Lightning™ kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Signal intensities were determined using the Fujifilm LAS-1000 system (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Japan). Triton X-114-mediated partitioning of proteins into aqueous and detergent phases was done as described (10Tanaka S. Maeda Y. Tashima Y. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14256-14263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All the statistical analyses were done with JMP Start Statistics (SAS Institute Inc.). Generating PGAP1 Knock-out Mice—The targeting construct for generating PGAP1 knock-out mice was designed to delete exon 5 of the PGAP1 gene, which contains a serine-containing catalytic motif (10Tanaka S. Maeda Y. Tashima Y. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14256-14263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Five chimeric male mice were able to sire PGAP1+/– mice. The analyses of PGAP1 knock-out mouse in this report are basically based on the first PGAP1–/– line, and the phenotypes observed in the first line were also examined in other lines derived from different embryonic stem cells. The genotypes of wild-type (PGAP1+/+), heterozygous (PGAP1+/–), and homozygous mutant (PGAP1–/–) mice were identified by PCR and Southern blot analyses of genomic DNA (Fig. 1). Peripheral blood cells of each genotype were tested for PI-PLC resistance. CD48, a GPI-AP, on wild-type but not knock-out TCR-β-positive mononuclear cells was sensitive to PI-PLC (Fig. 2). The same result was observed with B220-positive mononuclear cells (data not shown), indicating that PGAP1 was successfully knocked out in homozygous mutants.FIGURE 2PI-PLC resistance of peripheral blood of each genotype. Peripheral blood of knock-out or wild-type mouse was treated with (+) or without (–) PI-PLC for 30 min at 37 °C, and the surface expression of CD48 was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The dotted line shows the staining obtained with an isotype control for the anti-CD48 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) High Frequency of Perinatal Death and Otocephaly of PGAP1 Knock-out Mice—Breeding of PGAP1+/– male and female mice resulted in a smaller number of homozygous mutant mice than expected from Mendelian genetics (PGAP1+/+:PGAP1+/–:PGAP1–/– = 55(26%):122(57%):36(17%)). Most PGAP1–/– (31 out of 36 pups) died right after delivery or within 24 h of birth. More than half of the dead homozygous mutant mice showed severely disturbed face and jaw shaping, which seemed similar to the phenotype of otocephaly in mammalian species and humans (27Juriloff D.M. Sulik K.K. Roderick T.H. Hogan B.K. J. Craniofac. Genet. Dev. Biol. 1985; 5: 121-145PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bixler D. Ward R. Gale D.D. J. Craniofac. Genet. Dev. Biol. Suppl. 1985; 1: 241-249PubMed Google Scholar, 29Winter R.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Wallis D. Muenke M. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The severity of otocephaly varied among the knock-out mice from a normal face to a complete lack of mouth and jaw. Even the most affected were alive on delivery but soon became cyanotic and died. PGAP1 knock-out mice with normal faces were active and vigorous after birth, but milk was not observed in their stomachs when they died, even though behaviors of heterozygous mothers (retrieval and licking the pups) were observed. Those who survived the critical 24 h after birth were able to survive like other littermates, and finally we obtained four male and one female adult homozygous knock-out mice. The number of PGAP1–/– mice, even including dead ones, was smaller than that of expected from Mendelian genetics. To examine the possibility of embryonic lethality, we performed cesarean operations on pregnant mice at 18.5 days post coitus. Genotypes of 30 embryos from 3 mice were PGAP1+/+: PGAP1+/–:PGAP1–/– = 5:18:7. Four out of seven homozygous mutant mice showed otocephaly, but all of them were still alive in the amnia, suggesting that pups die immediately after birth. A comparison of sections from pups of each genotype showed that the brains of most homozygous mutants were degenerated, but that other organs looked intact. Most of the PGAP1–/– embryos lacked rostral structures. In PGAP1–/–, the oropharynx and mandible were developed, but the size of the mandible was small. In severely affected ones, no maxillary bone, nasal cavity, nasal sinus, or olfactory bulb was observed. Although the formation of telencephalon was detected in both PGAP1+/+ and PGAP1–/– embryos, the layer structure of PGAP1–/– embryos was immature. The cerebral cortex of PGAP1+/+ embryos consisted of layers arranged parallel to the meningeal surface. The density and number of cells in the most superficial layer of PGAP1–/– mice was lower than that in PGAP1+/+ mice, indicating an immature structure (Fig. 3). 43 embryos at 17.5–18.5 days post coitus derived from another embryonic stem clone had genotypes PGAP1+/+:PGAP1+/–: PGAP1–/– = 13:17:13. Three of the thirteen homozygous mutant mice showed severe otocephaly, two showed smaller faces, but all of the homozygous mutant pups were alive in the amnia. PGAP1 Knock-out Mice Show Growth Retardation—Peripheral blood of each genotype was used in serological tests for liver function, kidney function, and other biochemical tests, but no clear deviation was observed among the genotypes. Blood cell counts and isotype deviation of CD4+/8+ cells in T cells, or B/T cells in lymphocytes, were also similar (data not shown). General screening for behavioral phenotyping was also performed. There was no significant difference between PGAP1+/+ and PGAP1–/– mice with respect to general appearance, posture, gait, spontaneous behaviors, neurological reflexes, eyesight, and olfaction, but PGAP1–/– mice showed growth retardation compared with heterozygous or wild-type mutants, even though weaning and other dietary behavior looked normal (Fig. 4). Retarded growth curves were also observed in PGAP1–/– mutants in another clone (data not shown). Male Infertility of PGAP1 Knock-out Mice—To analyze male fertility, 6 male homozygous mutant mice were mated each with 3 BDF-1 female mice for 8 weeks. Sibling PGAP1+/– or PGAP1+/+ mice showed normal fertility, but none of the 6 PGAP1–/– mice sired a pup despite the presence of vaginal plugs after copulation, clearly indicating male infertility. One male homozygous mutant of another clone underwent the same experiment, and there was only one siring of 4 pups in 2-month mating, although plugs were admitted for each female wild-type mouse mated at least once during the period. Sibling PGAP1+/– or PGAP1+/+ male mouse sired averages of 9.0 or 9.8 pups (total 54 and 49 pups each). Knock-out Sperm Cannot Ascend from the Uterus into the Oviduct—Spermatozoa from PGAP1–/– mice were normal in number and motility (data not shown). Mammalian fertilization consists of multiple successive events, including sperm ascent from the uterus into the oviductal tube, sperm adhesion to the zona-pellucida (ZP), formation of a glycoprotein extracellular matrix surrounding the eggs, and membrane fusion of sperm and eggs. To examine at which step normal fertility is disturbed, firstly, we performed a sperm migration assay. Male mice of each genotype were mated with superovulated female wild-type mice. About 2 h after copulation, oviducts were excised with the connective part of the uterus, fixed, and stained to examine the presence of sperm in the oviductal tubes. Sperm from wild-type or heterozygous mutant mice were able to ascend into the oviduct, but those of homozygous mutant mice could not migrate into the oviductal tube (Fig. 5). PGAP1 Knock-out Sperm Scarcely Bind to the ZP—To examine the ability of mutant sperm to bind to the ZP, we incubated sperm of wild-type or homozygous mutants with eggs in buffer and counted the number of sperm attached to the ZP. Homozygous mutant sperm showed poor binding to the ZP compared with wild-type sperm (WT:KO = 11.9:2.9 sperm per egg, t < 0.0001, unpaired Student's t test) (Fig. 6). The fertilization rate was examined with two pairs of WT and KO mice as described under “Experimental Procedures”: the average rate in the knock-out was 2.7% compared with 51.3% for wild-type sperm. Fusion of the sperm and egg was assessed by a zona-free egg sperm penetration assay (21Yamagata K. Nakanishi T. Ikawa M. Yamaguchi R. Moss S.B. Okabe M. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 348-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and both wild-type and homozygous mutant sperm showed normal fusion (data not shown). Poor sperm binding of knock-out mice was repeated in another PGAP1 knock-out line (WT:KO = 12.2:0.1 sperm per egg, t < 0.0001). In the second PGAP1 knock-out mouse line, the average fertilization rate was 27.2% for PGAP1–/– and 82.7% for wild type. In the second experiment, we used the mutant line crossed with AKR mice. A higher rate of fertilization in vitro with homozygous mutants may be due to the difference of genetic background or technical effects. These results indicate that PGAP1 knock-out male mice are infertile because of the inability of their sperm to ascend into the oviduct and bind the ZP. Increased Expression Levels of GPI-APs in PGAP1–/– Mice—Next, we examined the expression in sperm of certain proteins that are presumably closely associated with sperm binding to the ZP, and with sperm migration from the uterus into the oviduct.

https://openalex.org/W2048491884,"Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) arising in childhood is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma in adult life. Between 1986 and 1990, approximately 120,000 Gambian newborns were enrolled in a randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of infant HBV vaccination on the prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma in adulthood. These children are now in adolescence and approaching adulthood, when the onset of sexual activity may challenge their hepatitis B immunity. Thus a booster dose in adolescence could be important to maintain long-term protection.Fifteen years after the start of the HBV infant vaccination study, 492 vaccinated and 424 unvaccinated children were identified to determine vaccine efficacy against infection and carriage in adolescence. At the same time, 297 of the 492 infant-vaccinated subjects were randomly offered a booster dose of HBV vaccine. Anti-HBs was measured before the booster, and two weeks and 1 year afterwards (ISRCTN71271385).Vaccine efficacy 15 years after vaccination was 67.0% against infection as manifest by anti-HBc positivity (95% CI 58.2-74.6%), and 96.6% against HBsAg carriage (95% CI 91.5-100%). 31.2% of participants had detectable anti-HBs with a GMC of 32 IU/l. For 168 boosted participants GMC anti-HBs responses were 38 IU/l prior to vaccination, 524 IU/l two weeks after boosting, and 101 IU/l after 1 year.HBV vaccination in infants confers very good protection against carriage up to 15 years of age, although a large proportion of vaccinated subjects did not have detectable anti-HBs at this age. The response to boosting persisted for at least a year.Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN71271385."
https://openalex.org/W1976123633,"Background Tuberculin-specific T-cell responses have low diagnostic specificity in BCG vaccinated populations. While subunit-antigen (e.g. ESAT-6, CFP-10) based tests are useful for diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection, there is no reliable immunological test for active pulmonary tuberculosis. Notably, all existing immunological tuberculosis-tests are based on T-cell response size, whereas the diagnostic potential of T-cell response quality has never been explored. This includes surface marker expression and functionality of mycobacterial antigen specific T-cells. Methodology/Principal Findings Flow-cytometry was used to examine over-night antigen-stimulated T-cells from tuberculosis patients and controls. Tuberculin and/or the relatively M. tuberculosis specific ESAT-6 protein were used as stimulants. A set of classic surface markers of T-cell naïve/memory differentiation was selected and IFN-γ production was used to identify T-cells recognizing these antigens. The percentage of tuberculin-specific T-helper-cells lacking the surface receptor CD27, a state associated with advanced differentiation, varied considerably between individuals (from less than 5% to more than 95%). Healthy BCG vaccinated individuals had significantly fewer CD27-negative tuberculin-reactive CD4 T-cells than patients with smear and/or culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis, discriminating these groups with high sensitivity and specificity, whereas individuals with latent tuberculosis infection exhibited levels in between. Conclusions/Significance Smear and/or culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis can be diagnosed by a rapid and reliable immunological test based on the distribution of CD27 expression on peripheral blood tuberculin specific T-cells. This test works very well even in a BCG vaccinated population. It is simple and will be of great utility in situations where sputum specimens are difficult to obtain or sputum-smear is negative. It will also help avoid unnecessary hospitalization and patient isolation."
https://openalex.org/W2119335675,"The impact of climate on biodiversity is indisputable. Climate changes over geological time must have significantly influenced the evolution of biodiversity, ultimately leading to its present pattern. Here we consider the paleoclimate data record, inferring that present-day hot and cold environments should contain, respectively, the largest and the smallest diversity of ancestral lineages of microbial eukaryotes.We investigate this hypothesis by analyzing an original dataset of 18S rRNA gene sequences from Western Greenland in the Arctic, and data from the existing literature on 18S rRNA gene diversity in hydrothermal vent, temperate sediments, and anoxic water column communities. Unexpectedly, the community from the cold environment emerged as one of the richest observed to date in protistan species, and most diverse in ancestral lineages.This pattern is consistent with natural selection sweeps on aerobic non-psychrophilic microbial eukaryotes repeatedly caused by low temperatures and global anoxia of snowball Earth conditions. It implies that cold refuges persisted through the periods of greenhouse conditions, which agrees with some, although not all, current views on the extent of the past global cooling and warming events. We therefore identify cold environments as promising targets for microbial discovery."
https://openalex.org/W1993335563,"Gene array analysis revealed that a subset of mRNAs overexpressed in macrophages lacking the destabilizing factor TTP are also overexpressed in macrophages lacking the translational silencer TIA-1. We confirmed that a representative transcript, apobec-1, is significantly stabilized in cells lacking TIA-1. Tethering TIA-1 to a reporter transcript also promotes mRNA decay, suggesting that TIA-1-mediated translational silencing can render mRNA susceptible to the decay machinery. TIA-1-mediated decay is inhibited by small interfering RNAs targeting components of either the 5′-3′ (e.g. DCP2) or the 3′-5′ (e.g. exosome component Rrp46) decay pathways, suggesting that TIA-1 renders mRNA susceptible to both major decay pathways. TIA-1-mediated decay is inhibited by cycloheximide and emetine, drugs that stabilize polysomes, but is unaffected by puromycin, a drug that disassembles polysomes.

Studies using mutant mice reveal that TIA-1 and TIAR dampen the expression of proteins encoded by ARE-containing transcripts without affecting mRNA levels (5Piecyk M. Wax S. Beck A.R. Kedersha N. Gupta M. Maritim B. Chen S. Gueydan C. Kruys V. Streuli M. Anderson P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4154-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). TIA-1 and TIAR reduce the expression of these proteins by holding their mRNAs in a translationally repressed state. Mice lacking TIA-1 develop mild arthritis, a reflection of their hyper-inflammatory state (11Phillips K. Kedersha N. Shen L. Blackshear P.J. Anderson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2011-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). TIA-1 and TIAR also participate in the stress-induced translational arrest observed in cells subjected to noxious stimuli. Eukaryotic cells exposed to heat, UV irradiation, or oxidative conditions reprogram mRNA translation to allow the selective synthesis of stress response and repair proteins (12Anderson P. Kedersha N. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3227-3234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the translation of housekeeping proteins is turned off and the mRNAs encoding these proteins move from polysomes to discrete cytoplasmic foci known as stress granules (SGs) (13Anderson P. Kedersha N. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). TIA-1 and TIAR promote the assembly of a noncanonical 48S preinitiation complex that is the core component of SGs (14Kedersha N. Chen S. Gilks N. Li W. Miller I.J. Stahl J. Anderson P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). SG assembly and disassembly play a central role in reprogramming mRNA translation and decay both in stressed cells and in cells that are recovering from stress (13Anderson P. Kedersha N. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). SGs are spatially and compositionally linked to processing bodies (PBs), related RNA granules that regulate mRNA translation and decay in both stressed and unstressed cells (15Kedersha N. Stoecklin G. Ayodele M. Yacono P. Lykke-Andersen J. Fitzler M. Scheuner D. Kaufman R. Golan D.E. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). SGs and PBs coordinately regulate mRNA translation and decay, thus emphasizing the connection between these processes (13Anderson P. Kedersha N. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). The ability of mRNA to move from polysomes to either SGs (16Kedersha N. Cho M.R. Li W. Yacono P.W. Chen S. Gilks N. Golan D.E. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) or PBs (17Brengues M. Teixeira D. Parker R. Science. 2005; 310: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) suggests that mRNA exists in a dynamic equilibrium between a translating state (i.e. polysomes) and a translationally repressed state (e.g. SGs and PBs). Several factors that repress translation by disassembling polysomes promote delivery of mRNA into SGs and/or PBs. In yeast, Dhh1 and Pat1p have been shown to drive mRNA from polysomes to PBs (18Coller J. Parker R. Cell. 2005; 122: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, drugs such as puromycin disassemble polysomes and deliver mRNA to SGs (16Kedersha N. Cho M.R. Li W. Yacono P.W. Chen S. Gilks N. Golan D.E. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). This equilibrium between the translated and the repressed state predicts that translational silencers such as TIA-1 and TIAR disassemble polysomes and thus make untranslated mRNAs available for degradation at PBs. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have found that macrophages lacking either TIA-1 or TTP overexpress a common subset of mRNAs. Here we provide evidence that TIA-1-induced translational silencing concomitantly promotes the decay of selected mRNAs. Microarray Analysis—Thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were collected from wild type, TIA-1 knock-out (TIA-1-/-) (5Piecyk M. Wax S. Beck A.R. Kedersha N. Gupta M. Maritim B. Chen S. Gueydan C. Kruys V. Streuli M. Anderson P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4154-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), and TTP knock-out (TTP-/-) (19Taylor G.A. Carballo E. Lee D.M. Lai W.S.

Isolated cells contain >95% macrophages, as verified by immunostaining with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-F4/80 antibody. Total RNA from wild type, TIA-1-/-, and TTP-/- macrophages (from ∼3 × 106 cells) was immediately isolated with TRIzol and was amplified for two rounds using the MessageAmp aRNA kit (Ambion), followed by biotin labeling with the Bioarray High Yield Transcription Labeling kit (Enzo Diagnostics) and purification with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). The resulting RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix Mu74Av2 chips according to the manufacturer's protocol. The initial “reads” were processed through Affymetrix microarray Suite 5.0 to obtain raw expression levels. Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from subconfluent TIA-1-/- or TIA-1 wild type (TIA-1+/+) peritoneal macrophages or mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) by using TRIzol reagent. RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using iScript (Bio-Rad Laboratories) to generate cDNA that was quantified by real-time PCR analysis (Mx3000P Real-time PCR System; Stratagene) using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Primers for apobec-1 are SY130 and SY131. Primers for β-actin are M189 and M190. Relative expression levels were calculated using the manufacturer's algorithm. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells or COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and Optimem medium (Invitrogen) were used for transfection of plasmids and/or small interfering RNAs. In reporter mRNA decay analysis, HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% Tet system-approved fetal bovine serum (BD Biosciences) for 24 h prior to the addition of doxycycline (10 μg/ml; Sigma). Sodium arsenite (0.5 mm; Sigma) was added in conditioned medium to induce stress granules and processing bodies. TIA-1-/- and TIA-1+/+ cell lines were generated in our laboratory as described previously (20Gilks N. Kedersha N. Ayodele M. Shen L. Stoecklin G. Dember L.M. Anderson P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5383-5398Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). 5,6-Dichlorobenzimidazole 1-β-d-ribofuranoside (DRB; Sigma) or actinomycin D (Sigma) were used to block polymerase II transcription. Plasmid Constructs—For pcDNA3-HA-PP7 coat protein, cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers G87 and G88 and ligated into the KpnI-EcoRI sites of pcDNA3-HA. TIA-1 was excised from pcDNA3-HA-TIA-1 with BamH1 and XhoI and inserted into the BamHI-XhoI sites of pcDNA3-HA-PP7cp. For pTet-T7-βglobin-PP7bs, six repeats of the PP7bs contained in the BamHI-BglII fragment of pSP73–6×PP7bs were ligated into the BglII site of pTet-T7-βglobin (21Stoecklin G. Stubbs T. Kedersha N. Blackwell T.K. Anderson P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Tet-off plasmid was co-transfected in every experiment in which pTet-T7-βglobin plasmids were used according to the manufacturer's instructions (pTet-splice; Invitrogen). Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated on 4–20% polyacrylamide gradient Tris-glycine gels and Western blots performed as described previously (16Kedersha N. Cho M.R. Li W. Yacono P.W. Chen S.

Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from subconfluent 10-cm dishes using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and 10 μg of RNA was resolved using 1.1% agarose/2% formaldehyde MOPS gel electrophoresis, blotted onto Nytran Supercharge membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) using 8× SSC, and hybridized overnight at 50 °C with digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes in digoxigenin Easy Hyb solution (Roche Applied Science). After washing at 60 °C with 2× SSC/0.1% SDS (10 min) and 0.5× SSC/0.1% SDS (20 min, 2 times), the membranes were blocked in blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at room temperature, probed with alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min, and washed for 30 min with 130 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5/100 mm NaCl/0.3% Tween 20. Signals were visualized with CDP-Star (Roche Applied Science). Probes were generated by PCR using digoxigenin-labeled nucleotides (Roche Applied Science) globin and nucleolin cDNAs and the primer pairs G29/G30 and G83/G84, respectively. Fluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (16Kedersha N. Cho M.R. Li W. Yacono P.W. Chen S. Gilks N. Golan D.E. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, followed by post-fixation for 10 min at -20° in methanol. The fixed cells were stored in 70% ethanol at 4 °C until use. Coverslips were rinsed two times for 5 min in 2× SSC on an orbital shaker. The cells were hybridized with probes complementary to globin in in situ hybridization buffer (Ambion) at 45 °C for 4 h. After washing with 4× SSC for 5 min, the coverslips were washed twice more with 2× SSC for 5 min and then incubated with gentle shaking for 1 h at room temperature in 2× SSC containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and the indicated antibody. Coverslips were then washed with 2× SSC three times for 5 min each and incubated with gentle shaking for 1 h at room temperature in 2× SSC containing 0.1% Triton X and the developing antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). After washing with 2× SSC three times for 5 min each, coverslips were mounted in a polyvinyl-based mounting medium. Cells were observed using a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope, and images were digitally captured using a CCD-SPOT RT digital camera and compiled using Adobe® Photoshop® software (v6.0). Human anti-GW182 (Advanced Diagnostics Laboratory) (15Kedersha N. Stoecklin G. Ayodele M. Yacono P. Lykke-Andersen J. Fitzler M. Scheuner D. Kaufman R. Golan D.E. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar) and mouse anti-HA were used to visualize processing bodies and recombinant HA-TIA-1, respectively. RNA Interference—HeLa cells were transfected with 40 nm siRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h, cells were re-seeded and transfected with 20 nm siRNA again for another 24 h. In decay experiments, pTet-T7-βglobin reporters and pcDNA3-HA-TIA with or without PP7cp plasmids in presence of Tet-off plasmids were co-transfected with the second siRNA. siRNAs were purchased from Ambion. The following target sequences (sense strand) were chosen. U0 (control): 5′-GAAUGCUCAUGUUGAAUCA-3′; D0 (control), 5′-GCAUUCACUUGGAUAGUAA-3′; C1 (dcp1), 5′-GCAAGCUUGUCGAUAUAUA-3′;D2(dcp2), 5′-GAAAUUGCCUUGUCAUAGA-3′;D3(dcp2), 5′-GUAUCAAGAUUCACCUAAU-3′;X1(xrn1), 5′-UGAUGAUGUUCACUUUAGA-3′;X2(xrn1), 5′-AGAUGAACUUACCGUAGAA-3′;P6 (rrp46), 5′-GCAAAGAGAUUUUCAACAA-3′;P7(rrp46), 5′-CAACACGUCUUCCGUUUCU-3′.

Gene Array Analysis—Cooperative interactions between the ARE-binding proteins TIA-1 and TTP regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory proteins in activated macrophages (1Stoecklin G. Anderson P. Adv. Immunol. 2006; 89: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). TIA-1 inhibits the translation of ARE-containing transcripts (5Piecyk M. Wax S. Beck A.R. Kedersha N. Gupta M. Maritim B. Chen S. Gueydan C. Kruys V. Streuli M. Anderson P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4154-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), whereas TTP promotes the degradation of ARE-containing transcripts (24Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, several proteins that inhibit mRNA translation coordinately promote mRNA decay (25Holmes L.E. Campbell S.G. De Long S.K. Sachs A.B. Ashe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2998-3010Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting that TIA-1-induced translational silencing might promote the decay of some transcripts. To test this hypothesis, we compared mRNA expression profiles in unactivated or LPS-activated macrophages derived from wild type, TIA-1-/-, and TTP-/- mice. Analysis of both unactivated and activated macrophages allowed us to control for the LPS-induced induction of TTP expression in these cells. The relative expression (TIA-1-/- versus WT; TTP-/- versus WT) of the genes most highly overexpressed in unactivated macrophages is plotted in Fig. 1A, and the relative expression levels (knock-out versus wild type) of the most highly overexpressed genes (Fig. 1A, red circles) in both unactivated and LPS-activated macrophages are provided in Fig. 1B. We then used real-time PCR to quantify the relative expression of individual transcripts normalized to β-actin, a transcript expressed at similar levels in WT, TIA-1-/- or TTP-/- macrophages, (Fig. 1C). This analysis confirms that some transcripts (e.g. apobec-1, edr, and acs14) identified in the array analysis are overexpressed in TIA-1-/- macrophages compared with wild type controls, whereas others (e.g. eps8, hp, otud4, fmr1, and hiat11) are not. The most highly overexpressed transcript encodes apobec-1, an RNA-editing enzyme that regulates the expression of lipoproteins (26Anant S. Davidson N.O. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The 3′-untranslated region of this transcript includes an “AUUUA” pentamer, a minimal element for the recruitment of ARE-binding proteins. We confirmed that the average relative expression (n = three independent mice) of apobec-1 (compared with β-actin) is significantly greater (p <0.05) in TIA-1-/- compared with TIA-1+/+ macrophages (Fig. 1D), suggesting that TIA-1 can regulate the expression of this transcript. We next compared the half-life of apobec-1 mRNA in MEFs derived from wild type or TIA-1-/- mice. Cells were cultured for the indicated times in the presence of DRB (Fig. 2, A and B) or actinomycin D (Fig. 2, C and D) prior to processing for real-time PCR to quantify the expression of apobec-1 mRNA (normalized to β-actin). The half-life of apobec-1 mRNA determined from several independent experiments is plotted in Fig. 2, B and D. In both cases, the half-life of apobec-1 mRNA is significantly greater (*, p <0.05) in TIA-1-/- MEFs compared with wild type controls. Although altered mRNA decay may not fully explain the increased expression of apobec-1 mRNA in cells lacking TIA-1, this analysis reveals that TIA-1 directly or indirectly promotes the decay of apobec-1 mRNA in these cells.FIGURE 2Half-life analysis. MEFs from WT and TIA-1-/- mice were treated with DRB (50 μm)(A and B) or actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) (C and D) to inhibit RNA polymerase II. At the indicated times, total RNA was isolated and the expression of apobec1 andβ-actin mRNAs was quantified using real-time PCR. The apobec1 signals were normalized toβ-actin signals, and the 2-h (A) or 0.5-h (C) value was set to 100%. The t½ of apobec1 mRNA in WT or TIA-1-/- MEFs was calculated from 3–4 independent experiments and plotted (B and D).

Wenig K. Hopfner K.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1372-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The system contains two components: 1) pcDNA3-HA-PP7cp-TIA1, a construct expressing a fusion protein between the PP7 coat protein and TIA-1; and 2) pTet-T7-βglobin-PP7bs, a construct expressing globin mRNA with a binding site for the PP7 coat protein in its 3′-untranslated region (see schematic, supplemental Fig. S1). The PP7 coat protein (PP7cp)/PP7 binding site (PP7bs) is analogous to the MS2 coat protein/MS2 binding site that is widely used to tether fusion proteins to selected mRNAs (31Le Guiner C. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10465-10476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). COS cells were transfected with the indicated constructs, solubilized, and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody to bring down HA-PP7cp and associated mRNAs. Cellular lysates (Fig. 3A, input) and immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3A, IP:anti-HA) were processed for Northern blotting (NB) to quantify reporter transcripts (glo) and endogenous nucleolin (ncl) mRNA or for Western blotting (WB) to quantify HA-PP7cp protein in the immunoprecipitates. This analysis confirmed that HA-PP7cp specifically binds to globin transcripts containing the PP7bs but not the MS2bs (Fig. 3A). In situ evidence for tethering of HA-PP7cp to globin-PP7bs transcripts was obtained by transfecting HeLa cells with the indicated combinations of proteins (HA-TIA-1 or HA-PP7-TIA-1) and mRNAs (globin or globin-PP7bs) prior to processing for immunofluorescence microscopy and in situ hybridization. In cells subjected to arsenite-induced oxidative stress, both HA-TIA-1 and HA-PP7-TIA-1 accumulate at cytoplasmic stress granules, whereas cotransfected untethered globin transcripts remain diffusely localized in the cytoplasm (supplemental Fig. S1). Reporter transcripts including the PP7bs are selectively recruited to SGs when cotransfected with PP7cp-TIA-1, providing morphological confirmation of the tethering of HA-PP7-TIA-1 to globin-PP7bs transcripts (supplemental Fig. S1). We next determined whether tethering of TIA-1 reduces the expression of globin mRNA or protein. HeLa cells transfected with pTet-T7-βglobin-PP7bs and pcDNA3-HA-PP7cp-TIA-1 were found to express reduced amounts of both globin protein and mRNA (Fig. 3B, lane 3) compared with control cells transfected with untethered combinations of pTet-T7-βglobin + pcDNA3-HA-PP7cp-TIA-1 (lane 1) or pTet-T7-βglobin-PP7bs + pcDNA3-HA-TIA-1 (lane 2). Thus, the tethering of PP7cp-TIA-1 to the reporter transcript significantly reduces the expression of both mRNA and protein. We also confirmed that PP7cp-TIA-1 reduces the expression of globin-PP7bs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). TIA-1 has previously been shown to bind to AU-rich elements found in the 3′-untranslated region of TNFα transcripts (4Gueydan C. Droogmans L. Chalon P. Huez G. Caput D. Kruys V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2322-2326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the ability of HA-TIA-1 and HA-PP7cp-TIA-1 to reduce the expression of reporters encoding the TNFα ARE and/or PP7bs. Consistent with previous results, inclusion of the TNFα ARE reduces the expression of globin reporter mRNA (Fig. 3D, Northern blot, lower panel, lanes 4–6) and protein (Fig. 3D, Western blot, upper panel, lanes 4–6). In the absence of PP7bs, neither HA-TIA-1 (lane 5) nor HA-PP7cp-TIA-1 (lane 6) further reduces the expression of this reporter. This result suggests that factors other than TIA-1 are responsible for ARE-mediated decay or that endogenous TIA-1 is sufficient for this process. In contrast, HA-PP7cp-TIA-1 reduces the expression of reporter mRNA (Fig. 3D, lower panel, lanes 9 and 12) and protein (upper panel, lanes 9 and 12) in the absence or presence of the ARE. In this system, the ARE and tethered TIA-1 have an additive effect on the reduced expression of reporter mRNA and protein (compare lanes 9 and 12). If TIA-1-mediated decay involves the recruitment of destabilizing factors, this event does not require the presence of an ARE. To confirm that the tethering of PP7cp-TIA-1 to the reporter transcript promotes mRNA decay, we compared the half-life of the globin reporter transcripts in the presence of HA-TIA-1 or HA-PP7cp-TIA-1. HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and then cultured in the presence of doxycycline to turn off transcription of the reporter transcripts. Cells harvested at the indicated times were processed for Northern blots to quantify the expression of the globin reporter and endogenous nucleolin mRNA (Fig. 4A). Decay curves are plotted in Fig. 4B, and mRNA half-lives are plotted in Fig. 4C. This analysis reveals that HA-PP7cp-TIA-1, but not HA-TIA-1, enhances the decay of the globin-PP7bs reporter, but not the globin reporter. This result indicates that tethering of TIA-1 to the 3′-untranslated region promotes mRNA decay.FIGURE 4Tethering analysis: half-life determination. A, HeLa cells were transfected with pTet-T7-βglobin and pcDNA3-HA-PP7cp-TIA1 (left panels, non-tethered), pTet-T7-βglobin-PP7bs and pcDNA3-HA-TIA1 (middle panels, non-tethered), pTet-T7-βglobin-PP7bs and pcDNA3-HA-PP7cp-TIA1 (right panels, tethered) in the presence of pTet-Off plasmid. Transfectants were treated with doxycycline (Dox) (10 μg/ml) to block transcription, and total RNA was isolated after 0.5, 2, and 3.5 h. Northern blots were hybridized using digoxigenin-labeled globin (glo) and nucleolin (ncl) probes. B, quantification of Northern blotting analysis. Signal intensities were quantified using the Image J 1.34S system. The globin signals were normalized to nucleolin signals, and the 0.5-h value was set at 100%. The percentage of the remaining mRNA (average ± S.E., four independent experiments) was plotted against time, and exponential decay curves were calculated using best-fit criteria.

Degradation from the 5′-end requires the decapping enzymes DCP1/2 and the 5′-3′-exonuclease XRN1 (27Eulalio A. Behm-Ansmant I. Izaurralde E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), whereas degradation from the 3′-end is mediated by a complex of exonucleases known as the exosome (28Buttner K. Wenig K. Hopfner K.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1372-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To determine whether one or both of these mRNA decay pathways is used during TIA-1-mediated decay, the expression of key components specific to each pathway was reduced using siRNA. The effectiveness of individual siRNAs was confirmed by quantifying the expression of endogenous proteins in cells treated with the indicated siRNAs (supplemental Fig. S2). As shown in Fig. 5A, control siRNAs (D0 and U0) or siRNAs targeting DCP1 do not affect the rate of globin-PP7bs decay. In contrast, siRNAs targeting DCP2 and Rrp46 significantly inhibit TIA-1-mediated decay. Surprisingly, siRNAs targeting the 5′-3′-exonuclease XRN1 do not inhibit TIA-1-mediated decay. Half-life determinations from several independent experiments are plotted in Fig. 5B, which also indicates the mean and standard error for each treatment. These data indicate that components of both decay pathways can affect"
https://openalex.org/W2071715208,"""FFM ME-TRAP"" is sequential immunisation with two attenuated poxvirus vectors (FP9 and modified vaccinia virus Ankara) delivering the pre-erythrocytic malaria antigen ME-TRAP. Over nine months follow-up in our original study, there was no evidence that FFM ME-TRAP provided protection against malaria. The incidence of malaria was slightly higher in children who received FFM ME-TRAP, but this was not statistically significant (hazard ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.3). Although the study was unblinded, another nine months follow-up was planned to monitor the incidence of malaria and other serious adverse events.405 children aged 1-6 yrs were initially randomized to vaccination with either FFM ME-TRAP or control (rabies vaccine). 380 children were still available for follow-up after the first nine months. Children were seen weekly and whenever they were unwell for nine months monitoring. The axillary temperature was measured, and blood films taken when febrile. The primary analysis was time to parasitaemia >2,500/microl. During the second nine months monitoring, 49 events met the primary endpoint (febrile malaria with parasites >2,500/microl) in the Intention To Treat (ITT) group. 23 events occurred among the 189 children in the FFM ME-TRAP group, and 26 among the 194 children in the control group. In the full 18 months of monitoring, there were 63 events in the FFM ME-TRAP group and 60 in the control group (HR = 1.2, CI 0.84-1.73, p = 0.35). There was no evidence that the HR changed over the 18 months (test for interaction between time and vaccination p = 0.11).Vaccination with FFM ME-TRAP was not protective against malaria in this study. Malaria incidence during 18 months of surveillance was similar in both vaccine groups.Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN88335123."
https://openalex.org/W1979919537,"Background Most traditional Chinese herbal formulas consist of at least four herbs. Four-Agents-Decoction (Si Wu Tang) is a documented eight hundred year old formula containing four herbs and has been widely used to relieve menstrual discomfort in Taiwan. However, no specific effect had been systematically evaluated. We applied Western methodology to assess its effectiveness and safety for primary dysmenorrhoea and to evaluate the compliance and feasibility for a future trial. Methodology/Principal Findings A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot clinical trial was conducted in an ad hoc clinic setting at a teaching hospital in Taipei, Taiwan. Seventy-eight primary dysmenorrheic young women were enrolled after 326 women with self-reported menstrual discomfort in the Taipei metropolitan area of Taiwan were screened by a questionnaire and subsequently diagnosed by two gynaecologists concurrently with pelvic ultrasonography. A dosage of 15 odorless capsules daily for five days starting from the onset of bleeding or pain was administered. Participants were followed with two to four cycles for an initial washout interval, one to two baseline cycles, three to four treatment cycles, and three follow-up cycles. Study outcome was pain intensity measured by using unmarked horizontal visual analog pain scale in an online daily diary submitted directly by the participants for 5 days starting from the onset of bleeding or pain of each menstrual cycle. Overall-pain was the average pain intensity among days in pain and peak-pain was the maximal single-day pain intensity. At the end of treatment, both the overall-pain and peak-pain decreased in the Four-Agents-Decoction (Si Wu Tang) group and increased in the placebo group; however, the differences between the two groups were not statistically significant. The trends persisted to follow-up phase. Statistically significant differences in both peak-pain and overall-pain appeared in the first follow-up cycle, at which the reduced peak-pain in the Four-Agents-Decoction (Si Wu Tang) group did not differ significantly by treatment length. However, the reduced peak-pain did differ profoundly among women treated for four menstrual cycles (2.69 (2.06) cm, mean (standard deviation), for the 20 women with Four-Agents-Decoction and 4.68 (3.16) for the 22 women with placebo, p = .020.) There was no difference in adverse symptoms between the Four-Agents-Decoction (Si Wu Tang) and placebo groups. Conclusion/significance Four-Agents-Decoction (Si Wu Tang) therapy in this pilot post-market clinical trial, while meeting the standards of conventional medicine, showed no statistically significant difference in reducing menstrual pain intensity of primary dysmenorrhoea at the end of treatment. Its use, with our dosage regimen and treatment length, was not associated with adverse reactions. The finding of statistically significant pain-reducing effect in the first follow-up cycle was unexpected and warrants further study. A larger similar trial among primary dysmenorrheic young women with longer treatment phase and multiple batched study products can determine the definitive efficacy of this historically documented formula.

https://openalex.org/W2058215738,"Background Subtype C is the most prevalent HIV-1 subtype in the world, mainly in countries with the highest HIV prevalence. However, few studies have evaluated the impact of antiretroviral therapy on this subtype. In southern Brazil, the first developing country to offer free and universal treatment, subtypes B and C co-circulate with equal prevalence, allowing for an extensive evaluation of this issue. Methods and Findings Viral RNA of 160 HIV-1+ patients was extracted, and the protease and reverse transcriptase genes were sequenced, subtyped and analyzed for ARV mutations. Sequences were grouped by subtype, and matched to type (PI, NRTI and NNRTI) and time of ARV exposure. Statistical analyses were performed to compare differences in the frequency of ARV-associated mutations. There were no significant differences in time of treatment between subtypes B and C groups, although they showed distinct proportions of resistant strains at different intervals for two of three ARV classes. For PI, 26% of subtype B strains were resistant, compared to only 8% in subtype C (p = 0.0288, Fisher's exact test). For NRTI, 54% of subtype B strains were resistant versus 23% of subtype C (p = 0.0012). Differences were significant from 4 years of exposure, and remained so until the last time point analyzed. The differences observed between both subtypes were independent of time under rebound viremia in cases of virologic failure and of the number of HAART regimens used by treated patients. Conclusions Our results pointed out to a lower rate of accumulation of mutations conferring resistance to ARV in subtype C than in subtype B. These findings are of crucial importance for current initiatives of ARV therapy roll-out in developing countries, where subtype is C prevalent."

The currently used drugs unfortunately possess very weak affinity for the human AR (hAR), thus indicating the need to develop new high-affinity steroidal antiandrogens. Our compounds are specially designed to impede repositioning of the mobile carboxyl-terminal helix 12, which blocks the ligand-dependent transactivation function (AF-2) located in the AR ligand-binding domain (ARLBD). Using crystal structures of the hARLBD, we first found that H12 could be directly reached from the ligand-binding pocket (LBP) by a chain positioned on the C18 atom of an androgen steroid nucleus. A set of 5α-dihydrotestosterone-derived molecules bearing various C18 chains were thus synthesized and tested for their capacity to bind hAR and act as antagonists. Although most of those having very high affinity for hAR were agonists, several very potent antagonists were obtained, confirming the structural importance of the C18 chain. To understand the role of the C18 chain in their agonistic/antagonistic properties, the structure of the hARLBD complexed with one of these agonists, EM5744, was determined at a 1.65-Å resolution. We have identified new interactions involving Gln738, Met742, and His874 that explain both the high affinity of this compound and the inability of its bulky chain to prevent the repositioning of H12.

NRs possess a typical modular structure consisting of three main functional domains: a variable NH2-terminal domain, a highly conserved DNA-binding domain, and a conserved ligand-binding domain (LBD) (2Jenster G. van der Korput H.A. van Vroonhoven C. van der Kwast T.H. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1396-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Upon binding of agonist molecules to their ligand-binding pocket (LBP), these receptors undergo an important conformational change that notably affects the position of the carboxyl-terminal α-helix (helix 12, H12) located in the LBD. When bound by an agonist, NRs become active transcriptional factors able to interact directly with DNA at specific response elements (REs) found in the regulatory regions of target genes. These DNA-NR complexes can then recruit coactivators through their ligand-dependent transactivation function (AF-2) formed upon H12 repositioning (3Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), and hence control transcription of specific genes. It has been shown that AF-2 specifically recognizes and binds the LXXLL motifs usually located in an amphipathic helix found in the coactivator sequences (4Hong H. Kohli K. Trivedi A. Johnson D.L.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The human AR is thus able to bind the LXXLL motifs but its AF-2 preferentially interacts with the FXXLF motifs found in certain hAR coregulatory protein sequences (7He B. Minges J.T. Lee L.W. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10226-10235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 8Hsu C.L. Chen Y.L. Yeh S. Ting H.J. Hu Y.C. Lin H. Wang X. Chang C. J. Biol.

Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) allowing this domain to interact with AF-2. This NH2-terminal domain/LBD interdomain interaction, only observed for hAR, is androgen-dependent (10Langley E. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 92-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be important in regulating a number of androgen-dependent genes.Through hAR, which mediates their action, the potent androgens testosterone (TESTO) and 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) regulate a wide range of physiological responses, most notably male sexual differentiation and maturation including the development, growth, and maintenance of the normal prostate (11Keller E.T. Ershler W.B. Chang C. Front. Biosci. 1996; 1: d59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 12Mooradian A.D. Morley J.E. Korenman S.G. Endocr.

Similarly, androgens and the hAR also play roles in the onset or progression of many androgen-dependent diseases and disorders, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (15Ginsburg J. Havard C.W. Br. Med. J. 1976; 2: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), hyperandrogenic syndromes (16Rager K.M. Omar H.A. Sci. World J. 2006; 6: 116-121Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), benign prostatic hyperplasia (17Hammond G.L. J. Endocrinol. 1978; 78: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and prostate cancer (18Krieg M. Bartsch W. Janssen W. Voigt K.D. J. Steroid Biochem. 1979; 11: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Treatment of these disorders thus require eliminating androgen-induced effects, either by reducing the concentration of androgens available or by blocking access to the hAR with antagonist compounds (antiandrogens), able to competitively inhibit the binding of androgens to the hAR (19Labrie F. Belanger A. Luu-The V. Labrie C. Simard J. Cusan L. Gomez J. Candas B. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 361-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20Labrie F. Dupont A. Belanger A. Lachance R. Giguere M. Br. Med. J. 1985; 291: 369-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Antiandrogens, despite their efficiency, have been associated with substantial toxicity (reviewd in Ref. 21Wirth M.P. Hakenberg O.W. Froehner M. Eur. Urol. 2007; 51: 306-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This could be explained by the fact that all the currently available pure antiandrogens, flutamide (Euflex), bicalutamide (Casodex), and nilutamide (Anandron), exhibit very low affinity for the hAR (10-100-fold lower than that of DHT) and must consequently be administered in high doses to be efficient. It is thus of primary importance to develop new higher affinity antiandrogens to diminish the amount of drug needed to block the hAR activity while, at the same time, greatly reducing or even eliminating the side effects of this type of treatment.With the aim of designing such new antiandrogens, we decided to make use of earlier structural findings on the human estrogen receptor (hER), a receptor structurally related to the hAR. The hER is unable to interact with coactivator partners when a ligand bearing a well oriented bulky chain is bound to its ligand-binding site (22Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). Indeed, as revealed by comparison of the crystal structures of the hER ligand-binding domain (hERLBD) in complex with a natural estrogen (estradiol, E2) and a potent antiestrogen (raloxifene), agonist and antagonist molecules bind at the same site within the LBD. However, they exhibit different binding modes, inducing a distinct conformation in the transactivation domain (AF-2) characterized by a different positioning of H12. More precisely, the size and structure of raloxifene prevent the molecule from being completely confined within the steroid-binding cavity. Consequently, its bulky side chain protrudes from the cavity and impedes H12 from adopting the position found in the E2-hERLBD complex structure, a conformation essential for interaction with transcriptional coactivators. Now concerning hAR, the crystal structures of its LBD (hARLBD) in complex with the natural androgens DHT and TESTO (23Pereira de Jesus-Tran K. Cote P.L. Cantin L. Blanchet J. Labrie F. Breton R. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 24Sack J.S. Kish K.F. Wang C. Attar R.M. Kiefer S.E. An Y. Wu G.Y. Scheffler J.E. Salvati M.E. Krystek Jr., S.R. Weinmann R. Einspahr H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4904-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) have shown that H12 occupies therein the same position as that observed in the E2-hERLBD structure. Such data suggest that this helix is essential for the function of the AF-2 of hAR and, like in the hER, participates in the interaction with coactivators. This has been confirmed by the structure of the liganded hARLDB in complex with a peptide derived from physiological coactivators (25Estebanez-Perpina E. Moore J.M.R. Mar E. Delgado-Rodrigues E. Nguyen P. Baxter J.D. Buehrer B.M. Webb P. Fletterick R.J. Guy R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8060-8068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 26He B. Gampe R.T.

Pfaff S.J. Payne E.S. Gron H. Buehrer B.M. Fletterick R.J. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E274Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).Using all the available structural information on the hAR, we then proceeded to molecular modeling studies to find the best position on an androgen nucleus (here DHT) for introducing a bulky chain able to reach the site normally occupied by H12. Finally, the combined data from molecular modeling and structure/activity relationship studies served as a basis for the design and improvement of the chain structure, with the aim of maximizing the affinity of these steroidal-based compounds for hAR. This rational approach yielded several different DHT-based ligands able to bind hAR with high affinity (many folds over that of DHT). In our in vitro tests, the majority of the synthesized compounds failed to inhibit the growth of DHT-stimulated cells or appeared to be potent agonists. However, a small subgroup proved to be very efficient antagonists of DHT stimulation, thus indicating that the particular structure of the bulky chain is of paramount importance for its activity. To understand the molecular basis of the agonistic and antagonistic properties of these different molecules, we attempted to crystallize a few of these compounds (agonists and antagonists) in complex with the human androgen receptor ligand-binding domain. Here we report the crystal structure of one of these agonist compounds bound to the hARLBD, EM5744 (Fig. 1), a DHT-based molecule with a strong affinity for the hAR despite its size, more than 150% that of DHT, and its bulky chain directed toward H12.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Chemical products were purchased from Sigma.

To a solution of benzyl ether (150 mg, 0.313 mmol) in methanol (15 ml) at room temperature was added sodium borohydride (37 mg, 0.964 mmol). After 2 h of stirring, the reaction mixture was quenched by water (15 ml), and then extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the C17 alcohol, as a crude product. The alcohol in acetone (15 ml) was treated with a 10% HCl (0.5 ml) and stirred for 1 h.

Cells between passages 37 and 50 were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 18,000 cells/well and allowed to adhere to the surface of the plates for 24 h. Cell proliferation was measured as follows. The medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 2% (v/v) charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and the indicated concentrations of compounds to be studied diluted from stock solutions in 99% redistilled ethanol in the presence of DHT (0.3 nm), to evaluate the antiandrogenic activity of these compounds, or in the absence of DHT, to measure their androgenic activity. Control cells received only the ethanolic vehicle. The indicated increasing concentrations of agents were added to triplicate dishes, and cells were grown for 10 days with changes of medium every 2-3 days. The cell number was determined by measurement of DNA content.Protein Purification—The hAR LBD was expressed and purified as described in Ref. 32Matias P.M. Donner P. Coelho R. Thomaz M. Peixoto C.

The hARLBD cDNA (residues 654-919) was cloned in the pGEX 5X-2 vector and expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS cells. Expression was carried out at room temperature for 15-18 h in LB broth supplemented with the ligand EM5744 (50 μm) after induction with 100 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Harvested cells were lysed with several freeze/thaw cycles and sonication in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.3), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0,5% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μg/ml lysozyme, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 μm EM5744. The soluble proteins were loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose column, washed, and eluted with 15 mm reduced glutathione. The glutathione S-transferase affinity ligand was cleaved with FXa and the protein mixture was loaded onto a DE52 anion exchange column. The eluted hARLBD without glutathione S-transferase was concentrated and further purified on a Superdex 75 size exclusion column using 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm LiSO4, 10% glycerol, 0,1% n-octyl-β-glucoside, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The purified protein was concentrated up to 4 mg/ml. Approximately 0.5 mg of protein were obtained per liter of cell culture.Crystallization and Data Collection—Protein crystallization was achieved using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature. X-ray quality diffraction crystals of hARLBD-EM5744 complex were obtained using the microseeding technique. The seeding solution was prepared by using a few crystals of hARLBD-DHT complex obtained in 0.1 m PIPES buffer (pH 7.0) and 1.5 m MgSO4 (23Pereira de Jesus-Tran K. Cote P.L. Cantin L. Blanchet J.

Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) added to 50 μl of this crystallization solution and pulverized with the Seed Bead kit (Hampton Research). hARLBD, freshly purified in the presence of EM5744 and concentrated to 3.9 mg/ml, was used to form crystallization drops in a 0.6:0.3:0.3 (v/v/v) ratio of protein, seeding, and well solutions (0.1 m MES (pH 6.0), 0.8 m sodium/potassium tartrate, 0.45 m MgSO4, and 0.4 m NDSB195). Crystals appeared within 3 days, grew for 2 weeks to a size of ∼250 × 80 × 50 μm3. Crystals used for x-ray diffraction experiments were soaked in Paratone oil and flash-cooled in a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K. Diffraction data were collected on beam-line BM30 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) using a MarCCD detector. The observed reflections were integrated and reduced using the XDS package (39Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3214) Google Scholar).

Cote P.L. Cantin L. Blanchet J. Labrie F. Breton R. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) to define structural characteristics of this receptor that could be useful for our rational design approach. In the hARLBD-DHT complex structure, the LBP is made of a large nonspecific apolar and closed cavity mainly formed by the side chain of several hydrophobic amino acid residues interacting with the steroid nucleus through van der Waals contacts. The binding site also comprises, at both extremities of the ligand, a few polar residues that firmly tether the steroid molecule via hydrogen-bond networks. Residues delineating the LBP belong to six α-helices (H3, H5/H6, H8, H11, and H12) and to a β-strand located between H5/H6 and H7 (Fig. 2). The last α-helix (H12) acts as a lid closing the supposed entryway by which the steroidal ligand reaches its binding site, ensuring the complete partitioning of the LBP from the external environment. The fact that a residue of H12 (Met895) is located in close proximity of the bound steroid is very interesting because it means that this α-helix may be reached directly from the LBP. This situation is quite similar to that found in the hERα structure, where Leu540, a residue of H12, delimits the steroid-binding cavity on the β-face of ring C of the estradiol molecule (22Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). The structure of the hERα complexed with its selective antagonist raloxifene (22Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar) has revealed that occupation of the position of the side chain of Leu540 by a bulky substituent was sufficient to displace H12, the right positioning of which is a prerequisite for transcriptional activation of all NRs and for their interaction with coactivators. Consequently, we have considered the feasibility of designing an hAR ligand bearing a bulky chain, the purpose of which would be to prevent the correct positioning of the COOH-terminal extremity of its LBD, including the orientation H12.FIGURE 2Shape of the hAR ligand-binding pocket determined in the presence of DHT and schematic representation of the secondary structures (including H12) delimiting it.

Although SYTI to IX isoforms are expressed in insulin-producing cell lines, hitherto only SYTIX has been associated with native beta-cell insulin granules and implicated in exocytosis. SYTVII was also proposed to regulate insulin exocytosis, but its subcellular location and number of alternative splice variants produced remain controversial. Only transcripts of SYTVII alpha, beta, and a novel splice variant delta are expressed in beta-cells and INS-1E cells. Western blotting revealed that INS-1E cells predominantly produced SYTVII alpha and low levels of SYTVII beta, whereas SYTVII delta was undetectable. The protein colocalized with insulin granules but not with synaptic-like microvesicles. Overexpression of SYTVII alpha resulted in decreased insulin granule content with a concomitant translocation of the variant to the plasma membrane, while SYTVII beta retained largely a granular pattern. Overexpressed SYTVII delta exhibited a distribution different to that of insulin granules and inhibited exocytosis when assessed by whole cell patch clamp capacitance recording. Silencing of SYTVII alpha by targeted RNA interference suppressed secretion, while repression of beta slightly increased release. Our results demonstrate that SYTVII is expressed on insulin granules and that only SYTVII alpha is implicated in exocytosis under physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2149859448,"Background In Mexico, the lifetime risk of dying from maternal causes is 1 in 370 compared to 1 in 2,500 in the U.S. Although national efforts have been made to improve maternal services in the last decade, it is unclear if Millennium Development Goal 5 - to reduce maternal mortality by three-quarters by 2015 - will be met. Methodology/Principal Findings We developed an empirically calibrated model that simulates the natural history of pregnancy and pregnancy-related complications in a cohort of 15-year-old women followed over their lifetime. After synthesizing national and sub-national trends in maternal mortality, the model was calibrated to current intervention-specific coverage levels and validated by comparing model-projected life expectancy, total fertility rate, crude birth rate and maternal mortality ratio with Mexico-specific data. Using both published and primary data, we assessed the comparative health and economic outcomes of alternative strategies to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality. A dual approach that increased coverage of family planning by 15%, and assured access to safe abortion for all women desiring elective termination of pregnancy, reduced mortality by 43% and was cost saving compared to current practice. The most effective strategy added a third component, enhanced access to comprehensive emergency obstetric care for at least 90% of women requiring referral. At a national level, this strategy reduced mortality by 75%, cost less than current practice, and had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $300 per DALY relative to the next best strategy. Analyses conducted at the state level yielded similar results. Conclusions/Significance Increasing the provision of family planning and assuring access to safe abortion are feasible, complementary and cost-effective strategies that would provide the greatest benefit within a short-time frame. Incremental improvements in access to high-quality intrapartum and emergency obstetric care will further reduce maternal deaths and disability."
https://openalex.org/W2093764676,"The murine transmembrane glycoprotein CD83 is an important regulator for both thymic T cell maturation and peripheral T cell responses. Recently, we reported that CD83 also has a function on B cells: Ubiquitous transgenic (Tg) expression of CD83 interfered with the immunoglobulin (Ig) response to infectious agents and to T cell dependent as well as T cell independent model antigen immunization. Here we compare the function of CD83Tg B cells that overexpress CD83 and CD83 mutant (CD83mu) B cells that display a drastically reduced CD83 expression. Correlating with CD83 expression, the basic as well as the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced expression of the activation markers CD86 and MHC-II are significantly increased in CD83Tg B cells and reciprocally decreased in CD83mu B cells. Wild-type B cells rapidly upregulate CD83 within three hours post BCR or TLR engagement by de novo protein synthesis. The forced premature overexpression of CD83 on the CD83Tg B cells results in reduced calcium signaling, reduced Ig secretion and a reciprocally increased IL-10 production upon in vitro activation. This altered phenotype is mediated by CD83 expressed on the B cells themselves, since it is observed in the absence of accessory cells. In line with this finding, purified CD83mu B cells displayed a reduced IL-10 production and slightly increased Ig secretion upon LPS stimulation in vitro. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that CD83 is expressed by B cells upon activation and contributes to the regulation of B cell function."
https://openalex.org/W2019885960,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a variety of stresses and aggressions to the cell wall stimulate the activation of the cell wall integrity MAPK pathway, which triggers the expression of a series of genes important for the maintenance of cell wall homeostasis. This MAPK module lies downstream of the Rho1 small GTPase and protein kinase C Pkc1 and consists of MAPKKK Bck1, MAPKKs Mkk1 and Mkk2, and the Slt2 MAPK. In agreement with previous reports suggesting that Mkk1 and Mkk2 were functionally redundant, we show here that both Mkk1 and Mkk2 alone or even chimerical proteins constructed by interchanging their catalytic and regulatory domains are able to efficiently maintain signal transduction through the pathway. Both Mkk1 and Mkk2 are phosphorylated in vivo concomitant to activation of the cell integrity pathway. Interestingly, hyperphosphorylation of the MEKs required not only the upstream components of the pathway, but also a catalytically competent Slt2 MAPK downstream. Active Slt2 purified from yeast extracts was able to phosphorylate Mkk1 and Mkk2 in vitro. We have mapped Ser50 as a direct phosphorylation target for Slt2 in Mkk2. However, substitution of all (Ser/Thr)-Pro canonical MAPK target sites with alanine did not totally abrogate Slt2-dependent Mkk2 phosphorylation. Mutation or deletion of a conserved MAPK-docking site at the N-terminal extension of Mkk2 precluded its interaction with Slt2 and negatively affected retrophosphorylation.

Signal is transmitted through this pathway by the sequential phosphorylation of a module composed of three protein kinases. MAPKs are activated by phosphorylation in both threonine and tyrosine residues within a conserved TXY motif. This unusual mechanism is catalyzed by the dual-specificity kinases, MAPKKs, which in turn are activated by a MAPKKK (1Raman M. Kim W. Cobb M.H. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3100-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 2Garrington T.P. Kim G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, 3Widmann C. Kim S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). Upon activation, MAPKs phosphorylate conserved motifs consisting on a serine or threonine followed by a proline in substrates that will be mainly transcriptional factors but also cytoplasmic proteins such as protein kinases or phosphatases, cytoskeletal components, regulators of mRNA translation, etc. (4Yoon S. Kim R. Growth Factors. 2006; 24: 21-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The existence of two sequentially activated kinases upstream the MAPK allows amplification of the signal by increasing the amount of protein kinase in every step of the MAPK module. For example, in the pheromone response pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this amplification occurs in every step (5Bardwell L. Kim J.G. Inouye C.J. Thorner J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 363-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 6Gustin M.C. Kim J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in the ERK1/2 pathway in mammalian cells, the amplification exists only between the MAPKKK (Raf) and the MAPKK (MEK), but not in the MEK-ERK step (7Ferrell Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 460-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cascade arrangement should allow signal transduction specificity to diverse inputs by avoiding cross-talk among pathways (8Schwartz M.A. Kim H.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This can be achieved by interaction of the integrants of a particular MAPK module with scaffolding proteins. This is the case of the S. cerevisiae mating pathway scaffold Ste5, which determines specificity of the MAPKKK Ste11 and MAPKK Ste7 toward the Fus3 MAPKs instead of their alternative downstream MAPK Kss1 (9Sette C. Kim C.J. Stroschein S.L. Iaquinta P.J. Thorner J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4033-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 10Bhattacharyya R.P. Kim A. Good M.C. Bashor C.J. Falick A.M.

Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In some cases, it is the MAPKK of the pathway that plays the scaffolding function, as reported for Pbs2 in the S. cerevisiae high osmolarity glycerol response pathway (12Posas F. Kim H. Science. 1997; 276: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Direct interaction of both yeast Ste7 and mammalian MAPKKs with their corresponding MAPK targets involves a “docking domain” or “D-motif” that is usually located at the N-terminal noncatalytic extension of the protein (13Grewal S. Kim D.M. Bardwell L. Cell Signal. 2006; 18: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Bardwell A.J. Kim L.J. Matsukuma K. Thorner J. Bardwell L. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). This motif cooperates with the scaffold to define the specificity of signaling (16Remenyi A. Kim M.C. Bhattacharyya R.P. Lim W.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 951-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Finally, the modular configuration might as well serve as a mechanism to retain inactive MAPK in the cytoplasm, as pointed out by evidence that activation of the mammalian ERK pathway results in dissociation of ERK1 from the complex formed with MEK1 and its translocation to the nucleus to execute the response (17Adachi M. Kim M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).Although not seen in all MAPK pathways, an additional advantage of assembling several kinases in a signaling module would be the possible operation of feedback regulatory mechanisms among their components. This has been reported to happen in the mammalian Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Once activated, ERK retrophosphorylates MEK1 in two residues, Thr292 and Thr386. The biological function of this retrophosphorylation is controversial, as some researchers did not find any variation on the catalytic activity of MEK1 in respect to its unphosphorylated form (18Mansour S.J. Kim K.A. Candi J.M. Hermann A.S. Gloor J.W. Herskind K.R. Wartmann M. Davis R.J. Ahn N.G. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 304-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19Gardner A.M. Kim R.R. Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas others suggested a negative role for this retrophosphorylation mechanism (20Brunet A. Kim G. Pouyssegur J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In general, little is known about regulation of MAPK pathways at the MAPKK level. However, mounting evidence suggests that MAPKKs are subject to fine regulation. For instance, some phosphorylation events on MAPKKs by other kinases different than MAPKKKs have been reported: MEK1 is also phosphorylated on Ser298 by p21-activated kinase (PAK) (21Coles L.C. Kim P.E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2236-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), leading to an enhanced MEK1-ERK complex association (22Eblen S.T. Kim J.K. Weber M.J. Catling A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6023-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MEK1 by ERK on Thr292 upon cell adhesion stimulation inhibits the phosphorylation by PAK on Ser298. Therefore, competitive phosphorylation of MEK1 by ERK and PAK regulate adhesion-dependent complex formation and activation (23Eblen S.T. Kim J.K. Tarcsafalvi A. Parsons J.T. Weber M.J. Catling A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2308-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Three of the S. cerevisiae MAPK pathways are orthologous to mammalian ERK modules: the mating pheromone pathway, the invasive growth pathway, and the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway (see Ref. 24Chen R.E. Kim J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 353-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar for a recent review). The MAPKK Ste7 is shared by the mating and the invasive growth pathways, respectively, phosphorylating either the Fus3 or Kss1 MAPKs (25Errede B. Kim D.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 26Sabbagh W. Kim Flatauer Bardwell L.J. A. J. Bardwell L. Mol.

In addition to the phosphorylation of Ste7 by the MAPKKK Ste11, pheromone induction leads to hyperphosphorylation of Ste7 mediated by Fus3 and Kss1 (25Errede B. Kim D.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 28Errede B. Kim Q.Y. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Seven residues in Ste7 have been identified as targets of Fus3 and Kss1 phosphorylation (29Maleri S. Kim Q. Hackett E.A. Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. Errede B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9221-9238Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The higher activity of Ste7 in cells lacking Fus3 and Kss1 initially suggested a negative feedback regulatory mechanism (25Errede B. Kim D.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 28Errede B. Kim Q.Y. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but further analyses did not reveal an inhibition of its kinase activity, rather favoring the hypothesis that retrophosphorylation of Ste7 might be a mechanism for determining signaling specificity toward the mating or invasive growth pathways (29Maleri S. Kim Q. Hackett E.A. Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. Errede B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9221-9238Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). MAPK docking domains (D-domains) were first described in Ste7 MAPKK (30Bardwell L. Kim J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 373-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and they were subsequently found to be present in multiple MAPK substrates, suggesting that they constitute a general mechanism for substrate recognition by MAPKs. Although the D-domain of Ste7 is known to partially contribute to signal transduction (14Bardwell A.J. Kim L.J. Matsukuma K. Thorner J. Bardwell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10374-10386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), its involvement on retrophosphorylation of Ste7 by Fus3 and Kss1 has not been studied.The CWI pathway in the yeast S. cerevisiae is essential to respond to cell wall damage and a variety of stresses, besides of being activated in a cell cycle-dependent manner during vegetative growth. Signaling through this pathway relies on stimulus-dependent activation of the yeast homolog of the protein kinase C (Pkc1) via its interaction with GTP-loaded Rho1 small GTPase. Pkc1 activates a MAPK module that consists of the MAPKKK Bck1, two MAPKKs, Mkk1 and Mkk2, and the MAPK Slt2, also known as Mpk1. In consequence, a transcriptional response involving the activation of the transcriptional factor Rlm1, the most prominent phosphorylation target of Slt2, leads to the expression of a number of genes involved in the maintenance of cell wall integrity (reviewed in Ref. 31Levin D.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 262-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). The polarisome protein Spa2 has been proposed to serve as a scaffold-like protein that recruits the MAPKKs and the MAPK of this pathway to sites of polarized growth (32van Drogen F. Kim M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1698-1703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although the yeast Slt2 MAPK pathway has been subjected to intense analyses, very little is known about its regulation at the level of its two redundant MAPKKs.To learn more about the role of Mkk1 and Mkk2, we have studied the contribution of each MAPKK in signaling through the CWI pathway, confirming a high degree of redundancy. We report here that Slt2 retrophosphorylates both MAPKKs and that a docking domain in their N-terminal extension is important for recognition of Slt2. Our data hint that feedback regulatory mechanisms might be exerted by the MAPK Slt2 on its upstream kinases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains, Media, and Growth Conditions—The S. cerevisiae strains used are listed in Table 1. Escherichia coli DH5α F′(K12Δ(lacZYA-argF) U169 deoR supE44 thi-1 recA1 endA1 hsdR17 gyrA96 relA1 (ϕ80lacZΔM15)F′) was used for routine molecular biology techniques. YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) broth or agar was the general non-selective medium used for yeast cell growth. Synthetic minimal medium (SD) contained 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, and 2% glucose and lacking appropriate amino acids and nucleic acid bases to maintain selection for plasmids. In SR, glucose was replaced with 2% raffinose. Galactose induction in liquid medium was performed by growing cells in SR to mid-exponential phase and then adding galactose to 2% for 6–8 h. Growth assays on plates were performed, typically, by growing transformants overnight in SD lacking uracil or YPD adjusting the culture to an A600 nm = 0.5, and then spotting samples of the cell suspension and three serial 5-fold dilutions onto the surface of YPD plates followed by incubation at 24 or 37 °C for 2–3 days. When indicated, plates were supplemented with sodium orthovanadate, caffeine, or Congo red, previously dissolved in sterile water and added to the medium to the desired concentration.TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this workStrainsSourceYPH499MATa ade2-101 trp1-63 leu2-1 ura3-52 his3-Δ200 lys2-801P.

Kim I.C. Nombela C. Martin H. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11027-11034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Integration of myc-tagged versions in the MKK1 or MKK2 loci was achieved by transforming the pRS306-based constructs linearized with HpaI. The plasmid carrying the pRS306-MKK1(1–222)-MKK2(216–506)-6myc chimera was constructed by overlapping PCR using primers MKK1Up and NB for amplifying the region corresponding to the N-terminal extension of MKK1 and primers CB and MKK2Lo for the region coding the C-terminal kinase domain of Mkk2, and cloned into the BamHI site in the pRS306-6myc. For the pRS306-MKK2(1–215)-MKK1(223–508)-6myc construction, primers MKK2Up and NA were used for amplifying the region that corresponds to the N-terminal extension of Mkk2, and CA and MKK1Lo for the sequence coding the kinase domains of Mkk1. Cloning was made by using the BamHI site in the same vector. Integration was performed by transforming these constructs opened with CellII for the chimera bearing the N-terminal domain of Mkk1, and with BstEII for the one bearing the N-terminal domain of Mkk2.The LEU2-based plasmids pRS305-MKK1-6myc and pRS305-MKK2-6myc were made by excising MKK1 and MKK2 from the pRS306Mkk1-6myc and pRS306Mkk2-6myc described above, using the BamHI site, and cloning them into the same site in the yeast integrative vector pRS305-6myc (35Flandez M. Kim I.C. Nombela C. Martin H. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11027-11034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These constructions were integrated in the MKK1 and MKK2 loci after linearization with CellII and Eco81I, respectively.Plasmids pRS416-MKK1-6myc and pRS416-MKK2-6myc were generated by amplification of the MKK1 and MKK2 promoters and coding sequences fused to the myc6 epitope from the yeast genomic DNA of strains that had integrated MKK1-6myc and MKK2-6myc from the pRS305-MKK1-6myc or pRS305-MKK2-6myc vectors, respectively. The primers used were MKK1ProHindUp (upper) for MKK1 and MKK2ProHindUp (upper) for MKK2; and MycHindLo (lower) for both. These amplicons were inserted in the HindIII site of the yeast centromeric vector pRS416.pEG(KG) plasmids bearing SLT2 and SLT2-F54 have been described previously (35Flandez M. Kim I.C. Nombela C. Martin H. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11027-11034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). pGEX(KG) plasmids bearing MKK1 and MKK2 were obtained by cloning from the pEG(KG)-MKK1 and pEG(KG)-MKK2 plasmids described previously (36Soler M. Kim A. Martin H. Molina M. Nombela C. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). MKK1 was excised and inserted in the pGEX plasmid using the XbaI-SalI sites, and MKK2 using the SmaI-HindIII sites.To obtain the different mkk1 and mkk2 mutant versions, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a DpnI-based strategy (37Wang W. Kim B.A. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) with Turbo PfuI DNA polymerase (Stratagene). pRS416-MKK1-K250R-6myc and pGEX-MKK1-K250R were mutagenized using primers MKK1KRUp and MKK1KRLo, and pRS416MKK2-K243R-6myc and pGEX-MKK2-K243R with MKK2KRUp and MKK2KRLo. The primers used for mutagenesis of the (Ser/Thr)-Pro sites of MKK2 were: T17AK2Up, T17AK2Lo, T153AK2Up, T153AK2Lo, S42A-S50AK2Up, S42A-S50AK2Lo, S42AK2Up, S42AK2Lo, S50AK2Up, S50AK2Lo, S437AK2Up, S437AK2Lo, S471K2Up, and S471AK2Lo. To obtain the pRS416MKK2(Δ23), the pRS416MKK2-6myc plasmid was modified introducing a BamHI site before the ATG start codon of MKK2 by site-directed mutagenesis using primers BamHI-1MKK2Up and BamHI-1MKK2Lo. To eliminate a second BamHI site in the polylinker of pRS416 the construct excised XbaI/HindIII and re-ligated in the opposite orientation. The MKK2(Δ23) fragment was amplified using primers 1–23NMKK2Up and MKK2Lo, and inserted in the BamHI site of the plasmid described before to replace the original MKK2. pRS416MKK2-L20AxL22A-6myc plasmid was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using primers LxLK2Up and LxLK2Lo.Two-hybrid pGAD424 plasmid bearing SLT2 and pGBT9 bearing MKK2 have been described previously (36Soler M. Kim A. Martin H. Molina M. Nombela C. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To construct the pGBT9MKK2(Δ23) plasmid, the fragment mkk2(Δ23) from the pRS416-MKK2(Δ23) was cloned in the BamHI site of the pGBT9 plasmid, and the phase was corrected by site-directed mutagenesis using primers pGBT9-23K2XXUp and pGBT9-23K2XXLo. pGBT9-MKK2-L20AxL22A was made by mutagenesis of MKK2 with primers LxLK2Up and LxLK2Lo.Protein Detection by Immunoblot—Standard procedures were used for yeast growth, cell harvesting, and cell breakage, as well as for preparation of protein-containing cell-free extracts, fractionation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10 BAbCO) was used to detect proteins fused to the Myc epitope and anti-V-ATPase 60-kDa subunit (13D11, Molecular Probes) was used as a loading control. Yeast MAPK Slt2 was detected with polyclonal anti-Slt2 antibodies described before (38Martin H. Kim J. Sanchez M. Molina M. Nombela C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAPK (anti-Thr(P)202-Tyr(P)204) antibodies (New England Biolabs) were used to detect dually phosphorylated forms of Slt2. Bound primary antibodies were revealed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies, as appropriate, and a chemiluminescence detection system (ECL™; Amersham Biosciences).Immunoprecipitation and Alkaline Phosphatase Treatment—Cells expressing Mkk1-6myc or Mkk2-6myc were treated with 5 mm sodium orthovanadate for 2 h and lysed as described above. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating 500μg of protein extracts with 1 μl of anti-Myc antibody for 1 h and subsequently 2 h with G-protein-Sepharose beads. After washing 3 times with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and 3 times with alkaline phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2), beads were preincubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Samples were treated or not with 10 mm sodium orthovanadate and 20 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase. The reaction was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and stopped by the addition of SDS-sample loading buffer.In Vitro Kinase Assays—GST, GST-Mkk1, GST-Mkk2, GST-Mkk1-K243R, GST-Mkk2-K250R, and GST-Mkk2-S42A-S50A-K250R were expressed in E. coli transformed with pGEX-derivative plasmids and affinity purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads as previously described (35Flandez M.

On the one hand, TULA was reported to increase activity of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases by inhibiting c-Cbl-driven down-regulation of their activated forms. This appears to be mediated by preventing interactions between ubiquitylated forms of activated protein-tyrosine kinases and proteins recruiting them to the degradation pathway and, possibly, by decreasing the level of c-Cbl (1Feshchenko E.A.

On the other, the lack of both proteins of the TULA/Sts family resulted in hyper-reactivity of T lymphocytes correlated with an increase in the activity of Zap-70, the molecular basis of which remained unclear (4Carpino N.

These results implied that the effect of TULA on protein-tyrosine kinases might not be the only mechanism through which TULA exerts its biological effect. Indeed, the presence in TULA of multiple functional domains and extensive stretches of amino acid sequences with unknown functions suggested that TULA might exert effects unrelated to either c-Cbl or protein-tyrosine kinases.In an effort to discover novel functions of TULA, we purified proteins that interact with TULA and identified among them apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). AIF is a key factor of caspase-independent apoptosis (6Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R.

Our work, presented here, demonstrates that TULA and AIF are interaction partners and establishes a functional link between them in inducing caspase-independent apoptosis. These results shed new light on the mechanism of the apoptotic effect of AIF and reveal a novel biological function of TULA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Constructs and Mutagenesis—cDNA encoding the full-length TULA or its N-terminal half (TULA-N1/2) was subcloned into the pFLAG 5a vector (Sigma) using the Advantage-Hf2 polymerase (Clontech). The forward primer (5′-CAGGATATCATGGCAGCGGGGGAG-3′) annealed to nucleotides at the N-terminal end of TULA and included a unique EcoRV restriction site. The reverse primers (5′-TAGGGTACCATCCGTGTAGTTTTCC-3′ and 5′-TAGGGTACCGTTGCCTGAGATCCAGTT-3′) annealed to nucleotides 893 to 908 (TULA-N1/2) or 1863 to 1880 (full-length TULA) within the TULA short (1Feshchenko E.A. Smirnova E.V. Swaminathan G. Teckchandani A.M. Agrawal R. Band H. Zhang X. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Tsygankov A.Y. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4690-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) protein sequence and included a unique KpnI restriction site. These restriction sites were included to create compatible ends for ligating the fragments into the pFLAG 5a vector. The obtained constructs were confirmed by sequencing.To introduce mutations, two synthetic oligonucleotides complementary to the opposite strands of double-stranded DNA containing the sequence to be mutated were designed to contain 15-18 nucleotides on either side of the mutation site. The oligonucleotides were gel purified (IDT Technologies, Coralville, IA). The mutagenesis reactions were performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).Cells—HEK293T and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (complete medium). HEK293T cells were plated 24 h before transfection to be 80% confluent on the day of transfection in antibiotic-free medium. Purified plasmid DNA was transfected into HEK293T cells (10-20 μg/2 × 106 cells) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After a total of 48 h, transfected cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were lysed in CelLytic buffer (Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. HeLa cells were transfected in the same fashion, but using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science).Jurkat tag cells were cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FBS (complete medium). The cells were grown in antibiotic-free medium for 24 h prior to electroporation. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended at a final density of 2 × 107 cells/ml in antibiotic-free medium. DNA (10 μg) was added to a 4-mm cuvette followed by addition of 1 × 107 cells in 500 μl of medium. The mixture was pulsed at 310 V for 10 ms in an electroporator (ECM 830 from BTX, Holliston, MA). After electroporation, cells were cultured in complete medium for 48 h. The efficiency of electroporation was ∼70%.In several experiments Jurkat tag cells were transfected using DMRIE-C (3 μg of DNA/5 × 106 cells) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Because the efficiency of DMRIE-C-mediated transfection did not exceed 10%, a GFP-encoding expression plasmid (pEGFP-C2, Clontech) was co-transfected in each sample at a ratio of 1:15 to the total DNA, and only GFP+ cells were analyzed using flow cytometry. Stable Jurkat cells with a reduced TULA expression level and the corresponding control cells were generated using the shRNA-encoding or empty control lentiviral vector (1Feshchenko E.A. Smirnova E.V. Swaminathan G. Teckchandani A.M. Agrawal R. Band H. Zhang X. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Tsygankov A.Y. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4690-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Z-VAD-fmk and Z-IETD-fmk (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and camptothecin and etoposide (Sigma) were added to final concentrations of 100, 4, 5, and 10 μm, respectively. Growth factor withdrawal of Jurkat tag cells was carried out in medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS. For anti-CD3 stimulation, wells of a 24-well plate were pre-coated with the mouse monoclonal antibody OKT3 at 10 μg/ml in PBS overnight at 4 °C.Isolation of TULA-associated Proteins—1-3 mg of total protein from FLAG-TULA-expressing or vector-transfected HEK293T cells was incubated with 20 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and anti-FLAG-bound proteins were eluted from the beads with 0.1 m glycine (pH 3). Proteins eluted from the anti-FLAG beads were separated on a one-dimensional BisTris minigel and stained in Simply Blue Coomassie (Invitrogen). Each gel lane was divided and cut into 10 equal-sized gel slices. Proteins contained within each slice were equilibrated in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin as previously described (22Joyal J.L. Annan R.S. Ho Y.D. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). One-tenth of each unfractionated tryptic digest was analyzed by LC-ES MS/MS using a micro-column (Zorbax C18, 75 mm × 12 cm) reverse-phased HPLC interfaced with an Agilent LC-MSD Ion Trap MS. ES MS/MS-based sequencing was performed on-line in a data-dependent manner, and two tandem mass spectra were taken per survey scan as peptides eluted from the HPLC (23McCormack A.L. Schieltz D.M. Goode B. Yang S. Barnes G. Drubin D. Yates 3rd, J.R. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Uninterpreted mass spectra from each of the 10 individual liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) runs were collated and searched as a single file against a human nonredundant protein data base using the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science) (24Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6706) Google Scholar). Errors used were 2.0 Da on MS data and 0.8 Da on MS/MS data.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—1-3 mg of total protein from whole cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with 1-3 μg of anti-TULA-N (GETQLYAKVSNKLKSRSSPS) (Proteintech Group Inc., Chicago, IL) in a total volume of 1 ml as described previously (1Feshchenko E.A. Smirnova E.V. Swaminathan G. Teckchandani A.M. Agrawal R. Band H. Zhang X. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Tsygankov A.Y. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4690-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Then proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with 1:1000 anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), 1:1000 anti-TULA-N, or 1:500 anti-AIF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). After blots were washed, the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was added, and proteins were visualized using the ECL Plus Kit and the Typhoon Fluorescent Imager (GE Healthcare).Annexin-V Staining—Electroporated Jurkat tag cells were washed and resuspended in 100 μl of annexin-V binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). Then 5 μl of 0.1 mg/ml propidium iodide and 5 μl annexin-V allophycocyanin conjugate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were added to the cells. After cells were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, 400 μl of annexin binding buffer was added, and cells were analyzed using flow cytometry. DMRIE-C-transfected Jurkat tag cells and TULA-knockdown Jurkat cells were analyzed using an annexin V-Cy5 apoptosis kit from Biovision (Mountain View, CA).Transfection of Small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs)—To deplete endogenous AIF and simultaneously overexpress TULA, a 21-mer annealed AIF-targeting siRNA and scrambled control (Ambion, Austin, TX) were resuspended in water at a final concentration of 100 μm. The sense sequence of the AIF-specific siRNA corresponded to nucleotides 1540-1558 in the AIF sequence. (Several AIF-specific siRNAs were tested in pilot experiments, and this siRNA was selected as the most efficient one.) siRNA was electroporated into Jurkat tag cells (100 nm siRNA and 1 × 105 cells in 75 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen)) using 1-mm cuvettes in the BTX Electroporator at 150 V for 100 μs. To simultaneously electroporate siRNA and DNA, FLAG-TULA expression or control plasmid (2 μg) was added to siRNA. After recovery in complete medium for 48 h, transfected cells were either cultured in complete RPMI1640 medium or subjected to serum deprivation in RPMI1640 supplemented with 0.5% FBS for an additional 24 h. At that time overall cell death was measured using trypan blue exclusion. To deplete endogenous TULA, the same electroporation procedure was done using TULA-specific siRNA SMARTpool L-008616-00 from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO).Subcellular Distribution—To obtain immunofluorescence images, HeLa cells were seeded onto fibronectin-coated coverslips (BD Biocoat) at a confluence of 50% in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS without antibiotics. On the following day, the cells were transfected to express FLAG-TULA and/or Myc-AIF (3 μg of each construct per coverslip) using FuGENE 6 as per the manufacturer's recommendations. Forty-eight hours post-transfection the cells were washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed again, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and washed twice with PBS. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-FLAG (5-10 μg/ml) and Cy3-conjugated anti-Myc (1 μg/ml) (Sigma) were added as appropriate. The antibodies were incubated with the cells overnight at 4 °C in the dark. The cells were washed three times with PBS before mounting the coverslips onto a slide with anti-fade mounting solution including 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole stain (Molecular Probes). Cell images were obtained using the Leica DM IRE2 confocal microscope with a ×100 objective.For subcellular fractionation, 293T cells were transfected with either empty or TULA expression vector (10 μg/75-cm2 flask) using Lipofectamine 2000. Subcellular fractions were obtained from transfected cells at 48 h post-transfection using a Qproteome Cell Compartment kit (Qiagen).RESULTSAIF Is a Novel TULA Interacting Protein—To search for novel functions of TULA we sought to identify TULA interaction partners via a proteomics approach. For this purpose, FLAG-tagged full-length TULA and TULA-N1/2 (1-299), a truncation mutant lacking the C-terminal half, but containing both binding domains of TULA (UBA and SH3) (see Fig. 1), were transiently overexpressed in HEK293T cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. The eluted immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and proteins associated with these forms of TULA were identified using LC-ES MS/MS. Several proteins were identified in the TULA and TULA-N1/2 immunoprecipitates and not in the vector control, and one of these was c-Cbl (8 unique peptides), a previously characterized TULA-interacting protein (1Feshchenko E.A. Smirnova E.V. Swaminathan G. Teckchandani A.M. Agrawal R. Band H. Zhang X. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Tsygankov A.Y. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4690-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 3Kowanetz K.

A second protein identified with 15 unique peptides was AIF. Originally, we identified AIF only in the TULA-N1/2 immunoprecipitates. However, the molecular mass of AIF suggested that it co-migrates with full-length TULA, which is a very large band on the SDS-PAGE gel. Because co-migration with TULA was likely to hinder identification of AIF in this system, we targeted four unique AIF peptides for mass spectrometry-based sequencing in the gel band corresponding to full-length TULA and identified AIF from all four peptide sequencing events. We performed these experiments using TULA and TULA-N1/2 in triplicate, and AIF was identified each time with more than 10 peptides in each trial (supplemental Table S1). Interestingly, c-Cbl was only identified in the immune complexes with full-length TULA.To verify association of TULA and AIF and to identify the region of TULA involved in AIF binding, we transiently overexpressed TULA and TULA mutants in HEK293T cells, immunoprecipitated them, and analyzed the obtained immune complexes using Western blotting. Consistent with the mass spectrometry results, co-immunoprecipitation of AIF was clearly detectable (Fig. 2A). Immunoblotting also showed that TULA-N1/2 binds to AIF better than full-length TULA. To assure that the difference in the amount of co-immunoprecipitated AIF was not due to differences in the cellular levels of AIF in cells overexpressing full-length TULA and TULA-N1/2 (as well as other TULA mutant forms, see below), we immunoblotted AIF in whole cell lysates and demonstrated that its level did not vary significantly between samples (Fig. 2B). Because the TULA-N1/2 mutant contains an SH3 domain and because AIF has several putative SH3-binding motifs (PXXP) including 545PSTPAVPQAP554, we hypothesized that TULA binds to AIF through the SH3 domain. However, the mutant form of TULA lacking a functional SH3 domain as a result of the W279L point mutation bound AIF with the same efficiency as wild-type TULA did (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the SH3-deleted forms of both TULA-N1/2 and full-length TULA bound AIF to the extent characteristic of the binding of AIF by TULA-N1/2 (data not shown). Likewise, deletion of the UBA domain had no effect on AIF binding (Fig. 2A). Finally, the TULA-C1/2 truncated form (amino acids 300-623) did not bind to AIF (data not shown). Taken together these findings indicate that the N-terminal half of TULA is necessary for AIF binding, but that neither the SH3 nor the UBA domain is critical.FIGURE 2Co-immunoprecipitation of TULA and AIF. 293T cells were transfected with wild-type (WT) and various mutant forms of TULA (10 μg of each construct per 75-cm2 flask, except for TULA-N1/2, which was transfected at a dose of 20 μg/75-cm2 flask) using Lipofectamine 2000. Control cells were transfected with the empty vector at a dose equal that of the expression constructs. Empty vector was added to transfections to make total amounts of DNA equal. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with an indicated antibody (NRS, normal rabbit serum) (A) or analyzed as whole cell lysates (WCL) (B).

Interestingly, high binding of c-Cbl to various forms of TULA was invariably linked to the low AIF binding to them and vice versa (Fig. 3), thus being in agreement with the findings of our mass spectrometry based experiments (see above). This mutual exclusion is unlikely to be due to a direct competition of c-Cbl and AIF for the same binding site, because c-Cbl binds to the SH3 domain of TULA (1Feshchenko E.A. Smirnova E.V. Swaminathan G. Teckchandani A.M. Agrawal R. Band H. Zhang X. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Tsygankov A.Y. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4690-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which is dispensable for AIF binding (see Fig. 2). It is more likely that c-Cbl and AIF bind to alternative conformation states of TULA or induce such states upon binding.FIGURE 3Binding of TULA to AIF and c-Cbl. 293T cells were transfected with various mutants of TULA as described in the legend to Fig. 2.

https://openalex.org/W2068810686,"Human AIF-M2 is an unusual flavoprotein oxidoreductase that binds DNA, nicotinamide coenzyme, and the modified flavin 6-hydroxy-FAD. Using multiple solution methods to investigate the redox chemistry and binding interactions of AIF-M2, we demonstrate that binding of DNA and coenzyme to AIF-M2 is mutually exclusive. We also show that DNA binding does not perturb the redox chemistry of AIF-M2, but it has significant effects on the reduction kinetics of the 6-hydroxy-FAD cofactor by NAD(P)H. Based on quantitative analysis of ligand binding and redox chemistry, we propose a model for the function of AIF-M2. In this model, DNA binding suppresses the redox activity of AIF-M2 by preventing the binding of the reducing coenzyme NAD(P)H. This DNA-mediated suppression of AIF-M2 activity is expected to lower cellular levels of superoxide and peroxide, thereby lessening survival signaling by Ras, NF-kappaB, or AP-1, as suggested from knock-out studies of the related AIF in human colon cancer cell lines. We show marked differences between AIF-M2 and AIF. DNA and coenzyme binding activity is retained in the C-terminal deletion mutant AIF-M2-(Delta319-613), whereas DNA binds to the C-terminal D3 domain of AIF. Our work provides the first analysis of AIF-M2 ligand interactions and redox chemistry and identifies an important mechanistic connection between coenzyme and DNA binding, redox activity, and the apoptotic function of AIF-M2. Through its DNA binding activity, we suggest that AIF-M2 lessens survival cell signaling in the presence of foreign (e.g. bacterial and (retro)viral) cytosolic DNA, thus contributing to the onset of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1969161625,"The RE-1 silencer of transcription (REST) is a transcriptional regulator that represses neuron-specific genes in non-neuronal tissues by remodeling chromatin structure. We have utilized human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a research tool to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate a neurogenic program of differentiation in non-neuronal tissue. MSCs are mesoderm-derived cells that generate specialized cells such as stroma, fat, bone, and cartilage. We have reported previously the transdifferentiation of MSCs into functional neuronal cells (Cho, K. J., Trzaska, K. A., Greco, S. J., McArdle, J., Wang, F. S., Ye, J.-H., and Rameshwar, P. (2005) Stem Cells 23, 383–391). Expression of the neurotransmitter gene TAC1 was detected only in neuronal cells and thus served as a model to study transcriptional regulation of neuron-specific genes in undifferentiated MSCs. Bone marrow stromal cells are known to transiently express TAC1 following stimulation with the microenvironmental factor interleukin-1α. We thus compared the effects of interleukin-1α stimulation and neuronal induction of MSCs on TAC1 regulation. Transcription factor mapping of the 5′-flanking region of the TAC1 promoter predicted two REST-binding sites adjacent to one NFκB site within exon 1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, mutagenesis, and loss-of-function studies showed that both transcription factors synergistically mediated repression of TAC1 in the neurogenic and microenvironmental models.

Together, the results support the novel finding of synergism between REST and NFκB in the suppression of TAC1 in non-neuronal cells. Adult and embryonic stem cells both show therapeutic potential for many diseases (1Baharvand H. Jafary H. Massumi M. Ashtiani S.K. Dev.

In addition, stem cells provide invaluable experimental resources to study developmental processes, including embryogenesis, cancer development, and aging (8Keller G. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1129-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 9Lotem J. Sachs L. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7663-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Rando T.A. Nature. 2006; 441: 1080-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). These in vivo processes are recapitulated in vitro in investigational models. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) 3The abbreviations used are: MSCs, mesenchymal stem cells; BM, bone marrow; REST, RE-1 silencer of transcription; HDAC, histone deacetylase; IL-1α, interleukin-1α; FCS, fetal calf serum; RT, reverse transcription; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; siRNA, small interfering RNA. are found in fetal tissues and in adults (11Deans R.J. Moseley A.B. Exp. Hematol. 2000; 28: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). Bone marrow (BM) is the primary residence of MSCs in adults (11Deans R.J. Moseley A.B. Exp. Hematol. 2000; 28: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). MSCs can transdifferentiate into several specialized cells, including functional neuronal cells, by in vitro methods (12Cho K.J. Trzaska K.A. Greco S.J. McArdle J. Wang F.S. Ye J.-H. Rameshwar P. Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Transdifferentiation is the process whereby a cell of one defined germ layer, such as mesoderm, differentiates into a cell of a different germ layer, such as ectoderm. MSCs differentiate along multilineages to generate cells of osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic types (11Deans R.J. Moseley A.B. Exp. Hematol. 2000; 28: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). MSCs have been shown to exhibit plasticity by generating specialized cells of all germ layers. However, as stem cells, it is unclear how MSCs can prevent premature expression of tissue-specific genes. The RE-1 silencer of transcription (REST), also known as neural restrictive silencing factor, is a transcription factor that represses target gene transcription by binding regulatory elements containing a consensus 21-bp RE-1 sequence (13Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Repression occurs through assembly of a repressor complex at the N and C termini of the transcription factor (14Ballas N. Grunseich C. Lu D.D. Speh J.C. Mandel G. Cell. 2005; 121: 645-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The N terminus recruits Sin3A/histone deacetylase (HDAC), and the C terminus recruits the corepressor Co-REST to mediate chromatin remodeling and repression of gene expression (14Ballas N. Grunseich C. Lu D.D. Speh J.C. Mandel G. Cell. 2005; 121: 645-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). REST expression has been demonstrated in non-neuronal, neural stem, and neural progenitor cells, where its function has been ascribed to repressing the expression of pan-neuronal genes in non-neuronal or immature neuronal tissues (15Lunyak V.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2005; 121: 499-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently, REST has been shown to exhibit both tumor suppressor and oncogenic activities, thus implicating its role in developmental processes (16Majumder S. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1929-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Coulson J.M. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R665-R668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In non-neuronal, neural stem, and neural progenitor cells, REST suppresses genes exclusive to mature neurons (18Sun Y.M. Greenway D.J. Johnson R. Street M. Belyaev N.D. Deuchars J. Bee T. Wilde S. Buckley N.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5630-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). More specifically, REST silences target genes involved in synaptogenesis, progression of the cell cycle, neurotransmitter biosynthesis, and electrophysiological function (18Sun Y.M. Greenway D.J. Johnson R. Street M. Belyaev N.D. Deuchars J. Bee T. Wilde S. Buckley N.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5630-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of REST is consistent with neuronal maturation and increased expression of neuron-specific genes. REST has been shown to modulate the expression of the neurotransmitter gene TAC1 (also known as preprotachykinin A) in a rodent hippocampal seizure model (19Spencer E.M. Chandler K.E. Haddley K. Howard M.R. Hughes D. Belyaev N.D. Coulson J.M. Stewart J.P. Buckley N.J. Kipar A. Walker M.C. Quinn J.P. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 24: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). One of the major encoded peptides of TAC1 is the neurotransmitter substance P, which belongs to the tachykinin family of neuropeptides (20Greco S.J. Corcoran K.E. Cho K.J. Rameshwar P. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 1782-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Repression of TAC1 has also been reported to occur through an NFκB-dependent mechanism in non-neuronal BM stromal cells (21Corcoran K.E. Patel N. Rameshwar P. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 2075-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We have shown previously the suppression of TAC1 in human MSCs, but up-regulation following transdifferentiation to neuronal cells (12Cho K.J. Trzaska K.A. Greco S.J. McArdle J. Wang F.S. Ye J.-H. Rameshwar P. Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This observation is significant in light of MSCs showing potential for application in neuronal tissue injuries (22Phinney D.G. Isakova I. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2005; 11: 1255-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). MSCs have also been proposed as stem cells that can be used in gene delivery not only for tissue repair, but also to sites of tumor metastasis (23Komarova S. Kawakami Y. Stoff-Khalili M.A. Curiel D.T. Pereboeva L. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). This led us to ask whether microenvironmental factors might affect neuron-specific gene expression in stem cells. This question is significant because expressed genes could potentially affect the surrounding tissues, thereby leading to microenvironment-stem cell crosstalk. This type of communication could be harmful and/or beneficial. Regardless, an understanding of the mechanism by which suppressed genes are affected by microenvironmental factors will lead to insights on communication between stem cells and their surrounding microenvironment. We addressed this general question with a focus on TAC1 expression in undifferentiated MSCs, their transdifferentiated neuronal progeny, and BM stromal cells because the latter are known to transiently express TAC1 following stimulation with the microenvironmental factor interleukin-1α (IL-1α). In the study, we focused on the roles of the transcription factors REST and NFκB. The latter was selected because of a functional binding site close to the binding region for REST within exon 1 of TAC1. Here we report on the synergistic roles for REST and NFκBin the repression of TAC1 transcription in undifferentiated MSCs and their suppression following neuronal induction or microenvironmental influence. Reagents and Antibodies—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12, α-minimum essential medium, l-glutamine, B-27 supplement, and hygromycin B were purchased from Invitrogen. Fetal calf serum (FCS), all-trans-retinoic acid, and Ficoll-Hypaque were obtained from Sigma, and defined FCS was from Atlanta Biologicals (Lawrenceville, GA). Recombinant human IL-1α was obtained from Hoffmann-La Roche, and recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Protease inhibitor mixture and human brain nuclear extract were from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA), and HeLa cell nuclear extract was obtained from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). Rabbit anti-REST antibody was purchased from Upstate; rabbit anti-p65 and goat anti-ribosomal protein L28 antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-RNA polymerase II monoclonal antibody from Active Motif; and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody from Sigma. Vectors—pGL3-Basic with the 5′-flanking region of TAC1 (pGL3-TAC1–1.2, 1.2 kb) was described previously and includes intron 1, exon 1, and upstream sequences (24Qian J. Yehia G. Molina C. Fernandes A. Donnelly R.J. Anjaria D.J. Gascón P. Rameshwar P. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2553-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). pCMV-IκBα-wt and pCMV-IκB-mut (where wt and mut are wild-type and mutant, respectively) are part of the Mercury IκB dominant-negative vector set from Clontech. The mutant sequesters NFκB in the cytosol by preventing its phosphorylation. pβ-gal and pTK-Hyg were purchased from Clontech. Culture of Human MSCs—Human MSCs were cultured from BM aspirates as described (25Potian J.A. Aviv H. Ponzio N.M. Harrison J.S. Rameshwar P. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3426-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Unfractionated BM aspirates (2 ml) were diluted in 12 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS (D10 medium) and then transferred to vacuum-gas plasma-treated tissue culture Falcon 3003 Petri dishes (BD Biosciences). The plates were incubated, and at day 3, mononuclear cells were isolated on a Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient and replaced in the culture plates. 50% of the medium was replaced with fresh D10 medium at weekly intervals until the adherent cells were ∼80% confluent. After four cell passages, the adherent cells were symmetric: CD14-, CD29+, CD44+, CD34-, CD45-, SH2+, and prolyl 4-hydroxylase- (25Potian J.A. Aviv H. Ponzio N.M. Harrison J.S. Rameshwar P. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3426-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). All experiments utilizing MSCs were repeated with different BM donors. Culture of BM Stromal Cells—BM aspirates were obtained from healthy donors between 18 and 25 years old. Nucleated cells (107) were added to 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks (Falcon 3109) in stromal culture medium (α-minimum essential medium with 20% FCS). Flasks were incubated at 37 °C. At day 3, the red blood cells and neutrophils were removed on a Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient, and the mononuclear cells were resuspended in fresh stromal medium. The flasks were incubated until the cells attained maximal confluence, with weekly replacement with 50% fresh stromal medium. At confluence, the trypsin-sensitive adherent cells were passaged. Cells were passaged at least five times before being used in experiments. Flow cytometry studies indicated that >99% of the cells were negative for CD14 and positive for prolyl 4-hydroxylase (26Singh D. Joshi D.D. Hameed M. Qian J. Gascon P. Maloof P.B. Mosenthal A. Rameshwar P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). All experiments utilizing BM stromal cells were repeated with different BM donors. Neuronal Induction of MSCs—MSCs at 70–80% confluence were trypsinized and then subcultured in 60-mm Falcon 3002 Petri dishes or in Falcon 353046 6-well plates (BD Biosciences). For Western analyses, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), 104 MSCs were seeded in 60-mm tissue culture dishes. For transfection studies, 103 MSCs were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates. All cells were allowed to adhere to the culture surface overnight in D10 medium. At 20% confluence, D10 medium was replaced with neuronal induction medium containing Ham's Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12, 2% FCS, B-27 supplement, 20 μm all-trans-retinoic acid, and 12.5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor. A stock solution of all-trans-retinoic acid was diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide to 20 mm. The induction by undefined FCS is permissive to commitment to other cells as opposed to the retention of pluripotency. In parallel studies, MSCs were cultured in medium with vehicle used for reconstitution of all-trans-retinoic acid and growth factors, hereafter referred to as uninduced MSCs (called D0 cells). The data in all experiments were similar for D0 MSCs and those cultured in expansion medium (D10 medium), with the latter referred to as undifferentiated MSCs. During induction, the medium was unchanged for a maximum of 12 days. Concurrent experiments replacing 50% of the neuronal induction medium after 4 days of induction yielded similar results. All experimental endpoints were performed with a maximal confluence of 70% to control for contact inhibition. Experimental endpoints for induced MSCs were 6 and 12 days of induction (called D6 and D12 cells). Previous studies have shown that these endpoints correspond to a partially differentiated and fully differentiated neuronal phenotype (12Cho K.J. Trzaska K.A. Greco S.J. McArdle J. Wang F.S. Ye J.-H. Rameshwar P. Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Semiquantitative and Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed, and 200 ng of cDNA was used to amplify TAC1, REST, or p65. For real-time RT-PCR, REST was amplified with the Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG kit (Invitrogen). The primers for REST and TAC1 span +2777 to +2985 (GenBank™ accession number NM_005612) and +60 to +328 (accession number NM_003182), respectively, with the following sequences: REST, 5′-ttc caa aaa gcc tcc tct-3′ (forward) and 5′-ggt ctc ctg atg cct ctt-3′ (reverse); and TAC1, 5′-act gtc cgt cgc aaa atc-3′ (forward) and 5′-ggg cca ctt gtt ttt caa-3′ (reverse). PCRs were normalized by amplifying the same sample of cDNA with primers specific for β-actin. The primers for β-actin span +842 to +1037 (GenBank™ accession number NM_001101), with the following sequences: 5′-tgc cct gag gca ctc ttc-3′ (forward) and 5′-gtg cca ggg cag tga tct-3′ (reverse). Real-time PCRs were performed with an Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR system. The cycling profile for real-time PCR for REST (40 cycles) and β-actin (40 cycles) was 94 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 45 s. Gene expression analysis was performed using the Applied Biosystems 7500 system SDS software. Normalizations were performed with β-actin, and values were arbitrarily assigned a value of 1. For semiquantitative RT-PCR, REST, TAC1, and p65 were amplified. The primers for REST and TAC1 were also used for real-time PCR. The primers for p65 span +1262 to +1424 (GenBank™ accession number NM_021975), with the following sequences: 5′-cag cca tgg tat cag ctc-3′ (forward) and 5′-ccc agg tct tca tca tca-3′ (reverse). PCRs were normalized by amplifying the same sample of cDNA with primers specific for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The primers for GAPDH span +212 to +809 (GenBank™ accession number NM_002046), with the following sequences: 5′-cca ccc atg gca aat tcc atg gca-3′ (forward) and 5′-tct aga cgg cag gtc agg tcc acc-3′ (reverse). The cycling profile for semiquantitative PCR for REST, TAC1, and p65 (40 cycles) and GAPDH (30 cycles) was 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. All PCRs (10 μl) were analyzed by electrophoresis, and fragment sizes were compared with a 1-kb DNA ladder (Invitrogen). ChIP—ChIP was performed using the ChIP-IT enzymatic kit (Active Motif) according to the manufacturer's specific guidelines. Briefly, uninduced (D0) and induced (D12) MSCs (stimulated for 16 h with 10 ng/ml IL-1α or left unstimulated) were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. Next, chromatin was extracted and enzymatically sheared into 500–1000-bp fragments. Sheared chromatin was separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose containing ethidium bromide to verify fragment size. Chromatin was incubated overnight with 2 μg of anti-REST, anti-p65, anti-IgG (negative control), or anti-RNA polymerase II antibody and then precipitated with protein G-agarose. Genomic DNA was then eluted with buffers provided with the kit. Enriched chromatin was analyzed by PCR using primers flanking the REST- and NFκB-binding sites within exon 1/TAC1. The primers span +689 to +801 (GenBank™ accession number AF252261), with the following sequences: 5′-act gag cag gcg aaa g-3′ (forward) and 5′-agt ccc gcg ggg tgg gat-3′ (reverse). Control chromatin enriched with anti-RNA polymerase II antibody for the GAPDH gene was analyzed by PCR using primers included with the kit. Total chromatin served as the input loading control, and water served as the non-template negative control for PCR. All PCRs (10 μl) were analyzed by electrophoresis as described above. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA for REST and NFκB binding was performed as described (27Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P. Mariano T.M. Donnelly R.J. Muthukumaran G. Cook J.R. Garotta G. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20915-20921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, REST- and NFκB-binding sites within the 5′-flanking region of the TAC1 promoter (-722 to +498; GenBank™ accession number AF252261) were predicted using the Mat-Inspector transcription factor analysis tool from Genomatix. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the predicted binding sites (REST1, REST2, and NFκB) were synthesized at the Molecular Core Facility of the New Jersey Medical School (see Table 1). Both sense and antisense sequences have TG overhangs that served as end fillings with reverse transcriptase (SuperScript, Invitrogen) and [32P]dCTP and dATP (50 μCi of 3000 Ci/mm; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). REST and NFκB consensus sequences are shown in boldface. Base pair changes within the mutant sequences are underlined and italicized. Extracts from HeLa cells and human brain nuclei served as positive and negative controls, respectively, for REST protein, and extracts from the breast cancer cell line MDA-MDB-231 served as a positive control for NFκB protein. For binding reactions, 5, 10, 25, or 50 μg of nuclear extract was incubated with 1 ng of double-stranded 32P-labeled oligonucleotide for 25 min at room temperature in 12.5 μl of binding reaction containing 10 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 12.5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 13 ng/μl poly(dI·dC) (Sigma). In the supershift assays, nuclear extracts were incubated with 2 μg of anti-REST or anti-p65 antibody prior to incubation with labeled probes. 25 μg of HeLa cell nuclear extract was found to be optimal for the wild-type REST1 and RE-1-binding element (positive control probe) oligonucleotides, whereas the maximal concentration of extract was used for all other binding reactions (13Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis of reaction mixtures was carried out at 400 V for 3–4 h at 4 °C on nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× Tris borate/EDTA. Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography or exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film with an intensifying screen for 12 h at -80 °C.FIGURE 1REST interaction and function in MSCs.A, total RNA from uninduced (D0) and induced (D6 and D12) MSCs was studied for TAC1 mRNA by RT-PCR (inset). Band densities were normalized with GAPDH, and uninduced values were arbitrarily assigned a value of 1. The results are presented as the mean ± S.D. (n = 5). B, shown is a schematic diagram of the 5′-flanking region of the TAC1 promoter, hereafter referred to as TAC1–1.2. TAC1–1.2 contains the noncoding exon 1, intron 1, and upstream sequences. Exon 1 contains two predicted binding sites for REST (REST1 and REST2) and one site for NFκB (p65). C, total RNA from D0, D6, and D12 cells was studied for REST mRNA by RT-PCR. Normalizations were performed with oligonucleotides specific for GAPDH (n = 5). D, REST mRNA levels were determined by real-time RT-PCR.

HeLa cell nuclear extract served as a positive control. F, D0 and D12 cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, and chromatin was extracted and sheared into 500–1000-bp fragments. ChIP assay was performed with anti-REST antibody and oligonucleotides flanking the exon 1/TAC1 REST sites. Normalizations were performed with chromatin enriched with anti-RNA polymerase II antibody (for GAPDH) or total chromatin (Input)(n = 3). Chromatin enriched with anti-IgG antibody or water served as a negative control for the PCRs.

Briefly, forward and reverse primers for the desired mutant sequence (see Table 1) were synthesized and used in PCR to amplify pGL3-TAC1–1.2. The resultant mutant REST1 and NFκB vectors were given the designations pGL3-TAC1–1.2/REST1-mut and pGL3-TAC1–1.2/NFκB-mut, respectively. Mutant DNA sequencing was performed at the Molecular Core Facility of the New Jersey Medical School. Stable Suppression of REST in MSCs—Construction of the small interfering RNA (siRNA) vector pPMSKH1 was described previously (28Rao G. Patel P.S. Idler S.P. Maloof P. Gascon P. Potian J.A. Rameshwar P. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2874-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The wild-type REST siRNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_005612) spans +1550 to +1568 (5′-gtg taa tct aca gta tca c-3′; pPMSKH1-REST-wt). The negative control siRNA sequence contains three nucleotide mutations within the gene-specific insert (underlined and italic): 5′-gtg taa ttt ata gtg tca c-3′ (pPMSKH1-REST-mut). At 50% confluence, undifferentiated MSCs or stromal cells were cotransfected with pTK-Hyg and pPMSKH1-REST-wt or pPMSKH1-REST-mut. Stable transfectants were selected with 25 μg/ml hygromycin. Stable knockdown of REST was evaluated by RT-PCR with REST-specific primers previously utilized for PCR. All knockdown cultures were maintained in medium containing hygromycin. Transient Transfection and Reporter Gene Assay—At 50% confluence, MSCs (uninduced and induced) and/or BM stromal cells were cotransfected with pβ-gal and pGL3-TAC1–1.2 (wild-type or mutant REST1; wild-type or mutant NFκB) using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). In additional studies, undifferentiated MSCs stimulated for 16 h with 10 ng/ml IL-1α or left unstimulated were cotransfected with pβ-gal, pGL3-TAC1–1.2, and IκB (wild-type or mutant). After 48 h, cell-free lysates were prepared as described previously (24Qian J. Yehia G. Molina C. Fernandes A. Donnelly R.J. Anjaria D.J. Gascón P. Rameshwar P. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2553-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).

However, the structures and interactions of the tail domains and the molecular mechanisms by which acetylation directly alters chromatin structures are not well understood. To address these issues we developed a chemical method to quantitatively determine binding affinities of specific regions within the individual tail domains in model chromatin complexes. Examinations of specific sites within the H2B tail domain indicate that this tail contains distinct structural elements and binds within nucleosomes with affinities that would reduce the activity of tail-binding proteins 10–50-fold from that deduced from peptide binding studies. Moreover, we find that mutations mimicking lysine acetylation do not cause a global weakening of tail-DNA interactions but rather the results suggest that acetylation leads to a much more subtle and specific alteration in tail interactions than has been assumed. In addition, we provide evidence that acetylation at specific sites in the tail is not additive with several events resulting in similar, localized changes in tail binding.

Nucleosomes are the fundamental repeating subunits of eukaryotic chromatin, comprising about 200 bp of DNA each, 147 bp of which are wrapped about 1.65 times around an octamer of the four core histone proteins (1Luger K.

Chromatin. 1989; (Springer-Verlag Inc., New York)Crossref Google Scholar). Strings of nucleosomes are assembled into secondary structures such as the 30 nm diameter chromatin fiber and the higher order tertiary structures perhaps exemplified by the ∼400 nm chromonema fibers (3Thoma F.

The organization of nucleosomes within secondary and tertiary chromatin structures and the molecular interactions responsible for their formation are poorly understood (4Woodcock C.L. Dimitrov S.

Approximately 75% of the mass of each of the core histones is organized into a largely α-helical domain that is assembled into the protein spool onto which the DNA is wrapped (1Luger K. Mader A.W.

The remaining mass is contained with the core histone tail domains, which project out from the interior of the nucleosome core and are accessible to both DNA and protein targets in chromatin (10Fletcher T.M.

The tails are essential for formation of higher order secondary and tertiary chromatin structures and participate in short and long range inter-nucleosome interactions (5Hansen J.C. Annu. Rev.

For example, a specific interaction between a region within the H4 tail domain and a charged surface formed by the H2A/H2B histone fold domains contributes to stability of the folded chromatin fiber (1Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6885) Google Scholar, 7Dorigo B. Schalch T. Kulangara A. Duda S. Schroeder R.R. Richmond T.J.

Science. 2006; 311: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). However, in general the structures and interactions of the tail domains are poorly understood. The core histone tail domains play key roles in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, and post-translational modifications such as acetylation of specific lysines within these domains are closely linked to transcriptionally active regions of the genome (25Allfrey V.G. Faulkner R. Mirsky A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar, 26Grunstein M.

Lysine acetylation can function as an epigenetic “mark” facilitating the recruitment of additional factors to specific loci to facilitate transcription (28Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6584) Google Scholar, 29Turner B.M. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). In addition, acetylation within the tail domains directly alters the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA and reduces the ability of nucleosome arrays to assemble into higher order structures (5Hansen J.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 361-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 30Lee D.Y. Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P.

Chem. 1990; 265: 5150-5156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which lysine acetylation directly alters the structure and functionality of chromatin remains unclear. Acetylation results in neutralization of the positive charge on lysine, and thus it is often assumed that acetylation weakens histone-DNA interactions, resulting in a more open and transcriptionally permissible chromatin structure (35Cary P.D. Crane-Robinson C. Bradbury E.M. Dixon G.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 36Hong L. Schroth G.P. Matthews H.R. Yau P. Bradbury E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 305-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent evidence suggests that the effect of acetylation may be much more complex. For example, acetylation of lysine 16 within the H4 tail domain abrogates an interaction between the H4 tail and a surface of H2A/H2B, resulting in a reduction in the ability of nucleosome arrays to condense into higher order structures (24Shogren-Knaak M. Ishii H. Sun J.M. Pazin M.J. Davie J.R. Peterson C.L. Science. 2006; 311: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). Moreover, UV laser cross-linking and circular dichroism experiments with native nucleosomes indicate that acetylation does not lead to a detectable reduction in histone tail-DNA interactions (37Mutskov V. Gerber D. Angelov D. Ausio J. Workman J. Dimitrov S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6293-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and may actually bring about an increase in the α-helical content of the tails (19Wang X. Moore S.C. Laszckzak M. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35013-35020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Finally, biophysical analyses suggest that the effect of acetylation on salt-dependent folding of nucleosome arrays is inconsistent with a simple charge neutralization mechanism (19Wang X. Moore S.C. Laszckzak M. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35013-35020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 20Baneres J.L. Martin A. Parello J. J. Mol.

To better understand the structures and interactions of the tail domains and the effects of post-translational modifications on these interactions, we developed a chemical reactivity assay to quantitatively evaluate binding of individual regions within the core histone tail domains. In this study, we focused on histone H2B tail-DNA interactions and the effect of acetylation on this domain. Our results indicate that acetylation in the H2B tail domain does not cause a global weakening of tail interactions but rather induces specific alterations in tail structure. Preparation of Core Histones—Coding sequences for H2B mutants were obtained from the wild type Xenopus H2B sequence by the Stratagene QuikChange kit and were cloned into the pET3a expression plasmid. Bacterial cells expressing these proteins were resuspended in 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 30 min. The mixture was then acidified with HCl to a final 0.4 m, incubated on ice for 30 min, then centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm. The supernatant was neutralized with 10 m NaOH to pH 8.0, and the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 1 m. Recombinant Xenopus histone H2A was expressed in bacterial cells separately, and H2A/H2B dimers were purified as described (39Hayes J.J. Lee K.M. Methods (San Diego). 1997; 12: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). All buffers included 10 mm DTT. 2The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; NCP, nucleosome core particle; FM, of fluorescein 5-maleimide. (H3/H4)2 tetramers were purified from the chicken red blood cell nuclei as described (39Hayes J.J. Lee K.M. Methods (San Diego). 1997; 12: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of Nucleosomes and Purification of Nucleosome Core Particles—Calf thymus DNA was sonicated into ∼1–2-kb fragments. H2A/H2B, H3/H4, and calf thymus DNA were reconstituted by salt dialysis in the presence of 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and then condensed to 2.5 mg/ml and digested with micrococcal nuclease (70 units/ml) at 37 °C for 10 min in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm CaCl2 to generate NCPs. The digestion was stopped by adding EDTA to 2.5 mm, and NCPs were purified on 5–20% sucrose gradients centrifuged at 4 °C for 18 h at 34,000 rpm. Reconstitution of Nucleosome Arrays and Purification of Mononucleosomes—The 208-12 DNA template, which contains 12 tandem 208-bp repeats of Lytechinus 5 S rDNA, was prepared and reconstituted as described (40Carruthers L.M. Tse C. Walker K.P. II I Hansen J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The molar ratio of histone octamer to 5 S DNA repeat DNA was maintained at 0.9 to produce subsaturated nucleosome arrays. 5 S mononucleosome was purified on 5–20% sucrose gradients after digestion of the array with EcoRI (32Tse C. Sera T. Wolffe A.P. Hansen J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Reaction of Nucleosomes and H2A/H2B Dimers with Fluorescein 5-Maleimide—NCPs containing H2B cysteine mutations were incubated in 10 mm DTT for 1–2 h at room temperature. and then DTT was removed by exhaustive buffer exchange to 10% glycerol TE using an Amicon YM-10 concentrator. NCPs were rapidly frozen and stored at -80 °C for extended periods. Samples of 0.8 μm NCPs containing different NaCl concentrations were reacted with 5.6 μm FM for different times, and the reaction was then stopped by adding DTT to a final concentration of 5 mm. 5 S mononucleosomes and arrays were treated in the same way. Reactions of free H2A/H2B dimers with FM was performed by chemical quench-flow (Kintec) to examine reaction points in the millisecond time scales. Reactions were initiated by mixing equal volumes of dimers (1.6 μm) and FM (11.2 μm) for various times, and then the reaction was quenched with 4 volumes of 10 mm DTT. In selected cases urea was added to 5 m final concentration to the reactions to induce unfolding of the dimers (41Gloss L.M. Placek B.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14951-14959Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Determination of Reaction Rate Constants—The extent of FM conjugation with H2Bs was analyzed by separation of samples in 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and then either whole gel fluorimetry (GE Healthcare) or digital photography of gels was illuminated by 365 nm light on a UV light box. The images were analyzed using ImageQuant (GE Healthcare) software, and reaction rate constants and global fits were determined using GraphPad Prism 4 software. Band volumes were determined at appropriate time intervals (At), and a maximal extent of reaction (A0) was determined from points in the curve where d(At)/dt = 0. kNCP was taken from fits of the standard single phase exponential equation, At = A0(1 - e-kt). Errors were propagated by the partial differential method from source values. Model, Assay, and Theory—Our experimental model is illustrated in Equations 1 and 2. The histone tail domains are dynamic structures in NCPs and exist in two states, either bound within the NCP (B) or unbound (U). Bk12⇄k21U(Eq. 1) The unbound form reacts preferentially with FM, U+FMk3→U-FM(Eq. 2) The free H2A/H2B dimer and U react with FM with identical kinetics (see below and Equation 3), D+FMk3→D-FM(Eq. 3) The B and U form are related by a conformational equilibrium constant (see Ref. 42Polach K.J. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 130-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 4, Keq=k12/k21(Eq. 4) Thus the reaction rate can be defined as shown in Equation 5, V=k3[FM][U](Eq. 5) Because the concentration of FM we used, [FM], is >5 times higher than that of NCPs, [FM] can taken as a constant, and Equation 5 becomes Equation 6, V=k_3^{{^′}}[U](Eq. 6) in which the pseudo reaction rate constant k3′ is defined as shown in Equation 7, k_3^{{^′}}=k3[FM](Eq. 7) Applying the steady state condition for the intermediate U, Equation 8 is given, d(U)/dt=0(Eq. 8) and considering the reactant NCPs, as shown in Equation 9, NCP=B+U(Eq. 9) and that the reaction of NCPs with FM can be described by overall rate constant kNCP, as shown in Equation 10, kNCP=−N−1d(N)/dt(Eq. 10) we have Equation 11, kNCP=k12k_3^{{^′}}/(k12+k21+k_3^{{^′}})(Eq. 11) There are two limiting cases for Equation 11 (see Refs. 42Polach K.J. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 130-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 43Shore D. Langowski J. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Case I—Slow conformational transition limit is shown in Equation 12, k_3^{{^′}}{&#x003E;}{&#x003E;}k21(Eq. 12) In this limit, Equation 11 is reduced to Equation 13, kNCP=k12k_3^{{^′}}/(k12+k_3^{{^′}})(Eq. 13) Case II—Rapid conformational pre-equilibrium limit, which is opposite to the case I, is shown in Equation 14, k_3^{{^′}}{&#x003C;}{&#x003C;}k21(Eq. 14) Now Equation 11 can be rewritten as Equation 15, kNCP=k_3^{{^′}}Keq/(1+Keq)(Eq. 15) At very low salt concentrations, Keq should less than 1. So, for case I, Equation 16, k_3^{{^′}}{&#x003E;}{&#x003E;}k12(Eq. 16) gives Equation 17, kNCP=k12(Eq. 17) For case II, combining Equation 7, we find that kNCP is linearly proportional to the [FM] in the reaction (see below). Thus the dependence of kNCP on [FM] can be used to distinguish these two models. For case II, this dependence is first-order, whereas case I is zero order. Fig. 1E shows that the dependence of the overall reaction rate constant, kNCP, on [FM] at two different NaCl concentrations is first order. So case II, rapid conformational pre-equilibrium limit, applies. Thus from Equations 8, 14, and 15 we have Equation 18, U/B=k12/(k21+k_3^{{^′}})=k12/k21=Keq(Eq. 18) and by rearranging we have Equation 19, Keq=kNCP/(k_3^{{^′}}−kNCP)(Eq. 19) As mentioned above and in the text, we assume that k3′, the intrinsic rate of reaction of the NCP U form with FM, is equivalent to the intrinsic rate of reaction for the corresponding free H2A/H2B dimer. Both the U form of NCPs and free dimer have highly mobile tail domains (16Hilliard Jr., P.R. Smith R.M. Rill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5992-5998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Smith R.M. Rill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10574-10581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed we find that the rate of reaction of the free dimer and the NCP at elevated salts (0.5 m) where the tails are expected to be completely released from binding sites within nucleosomes (17Walker I.O. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5622-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) are equivalent (see text). Despite numerous studies of core histone tail domains, actual binding affinities of these domains in the context of nucleosomes have not been determined. We reasoned that evaluation of the binding parameters for several sites within a tail domain would reveal fundamental aspects of tail function and of post-translational modifications within these domains. Thus we developed an assay based on a prior observation that the reactivity of cysteines placed within the histone tail domains reflected the binding state of the tail; very low reactivity was observed in low salt (TE) conditions, whereas reactivity was greatly enhanced when the ionic strength was raised to levels expected to shift the equilibrium toward a state where the tails were dissociated from the nucleosome surface. 3K.-M. Lee and J. J. Hayes, unpublished observations. We focused on the H2B tail domain for these initial studies, first examining the reactivity of a cysteine substituted at the 6th position in the H2B tail domain (Fig. 1A, H2BS6C) with FM. Note that cysteine is nearly isosteric with serine, and thus no significant alterations of tail interactions are expected from this single substitution. Reaction of NCPs containing H2B S6C with FM resulted in specific modification of H2B (Fig. 1B) and exhibited first-order kinetics, with an apparent rate constant kNCP that increased with increasing concentrations of NaCl in the reaction (Fig. 1C, see “Experimental Procedures”). A plot of kNCP versus [NaCl] (Fig. 1D) shows the overall reaction rate increases up to about 500 mm NaCl, a salt concentration at which the tails are completely dissociated from the nucleosome surface (15Cary P.D. Moss T. Bradbury E.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 89: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 17Walker I.O. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5622-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, kNCP describes the overall reaction as shown in Reaction 1 (where Nuc indicates nucleosome), Nuctail boundk12⇄k21Nuctail unbound+FMk3→Nuc-FMREACTION 1 Examination of the dependence of kNCP on [FM] indicates that this reaction behaves according to a pre-equilibrium kinetic model (Fig. 1E and see “Experimental Procedures”). Thus, the tail-bound and tail-unbound states are in equilibrium, and it is possible to determine a conformational equilibrium constant, Keq, relating the concentrations of these species as shown Equation 20, Keq=Nuctail unbound/Nuctail bound(Eq. 20) However, calculation of Keq requires determination of k3, reflecting the intrinsic rate of reaction of the unbound tail with FM. We assumed that the intrinsic rate of reaction of FM with the tail-unbound (nucleosome) species is equivalent to the rate of the reaction of free H2A/H2B S6C dimers with FM. In support of this assumption, we note that the rates of FM reaction with NCPs containing H2B S6C at ≥500 mm NaCl, where the tails are expected to be completely dissociated from the nucleosome surface, are equivalent to the rates observed with free H2A/H2B S6C dimers at the same salt concentration (results not shown). A plot of k3′ (see “Experimental Procedures”) versus [NaCl] as determined by reaction of the free H2A/H2B S6C dimers with FM shows that the intrinsic rate of the reaction is salt-dependent in a manner opposite to the salt dependence observed for kNCP (Fig. 1F). Repeating the assay at selected [NaCl] in the presence of 5 m urea indicates that the reaction rates for the free protein are not influenced by salt-dependent alterations in protein structure (Fig. 1F, diamonds). Calculation of KeqS6C over a range of [NaCl] (Fig. 1, G and H) yields data that can be fit by a sigmoidal curve and describes the release of the tail from the nucleosome surface, with the steepest dependence of KeqS6C on [NaCl] between 150 and 500 mm NaCl. KeqS6C values increase more than 2000-fold from 0 to 500 mm NaCl (0.00152 at 0 mm and ∼3 at 500 mm NaCl). The data indicate that the region of the H2B N-terminal tail encompassing residue 6 binds very tightly within NCPs at very low ionic strengths. However, at physiological salt (∼150 mm NaCl) KeqS6C is about 0.1 indicating that the end of the H2B tail is quite mobile, spending about 1/10 of the time dissociated from the nucleosome surface. Importantly, the data are consistent with previous quantitative determinations of the effect of salt on tail binding behavior (15Cary P.D. Moss T. Bradbury E.M. Eur. J.

We also note that the nucleosomes used in this analysis remained intact over the range 0–500 mm NaCl as expected (Fig. 2 and results not shown), as also indicated by the lack of labeling of the cysteine within H3 at position 110 (Fig. 1B). Other Sites in the H2B Tail—We next determined Keq values for two other sites within the ∼27-amino acid H2B tail domain by substitution of residues at positions 14 or 21 for cysteine (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, we find that these sites exhibit about a 10-fold greater binding affinity at low salt concentrations and ∼5-fold tighter association within the nucleosome in the range of physiological ionic strengths (150 mm NaCl) compared with site 6 (Fig. 1H). The dependence of the conformational equilibrium constants on ionic strength at sites 14 and 21 also fit sigmoidal curves as observed at site 6, with Keq values for these two sites increasing more than 10,000-fold from 0 to ∼500 mm NaCl (∼0.0001 at 0 mm and ∼1 at 500 mm NaCl). Moreover, the affinities of both sites are identical from 0 to ∼350 mm [NaCl] suggesting that both sites are components of the same structural element in the H2B tail when bound to DNA, and distinct from site 6. Effect of Acetylation Mimics on Tail Binding Affinity—We next attempted to gain insight to the direct effect of acetylation on tail interactions by examining the binding behavior of H2B N-terminal tail domains containing Lys → Gln substitutions to mimic lysine acetylation. Glutamine has a neutral side chain that resembles acetylated lysine in charge and structure and can functionally replace this modification in vivo. For example, in yeast H4 containing glutamine substitutions within the tail functions as acetylated H4 to prevent Sir3p binding and spreading of heterochromatin (47Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S.M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) and an H3-K56Q mutation partially suppresses the loss of acetylation of this residue in asf1 cells (48Recht J. Tsubota T. Tanny J.C. Diaz R.L. Berger J.M. Zhang X. Garcia B.A. Shabanowitz J. Burlingame A.L. Hunt D.F. Kaufman P.D. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Within the H2B N-terminal tail domain, 6 lysine residues have been reported to be acetylated in vivo, 5, 12, 15, 20, 24, and 27 (Fig. 1A) (2Holde K.E.

We first examined the effect of single Lys → Gln substitutions at each of these positions on tail binding within NCPs containing the appropriate mutants of H2B S6C. Determination of Keq over a range of ionic strengths showed that in general most single substitutions did not result in significant alterations in tail binding affinities (Fig. 3, A and B). Substitution of Lys-5, Lys-12, Lys-20, or Lys-27 for Gln resulted in no significant change in the range of 0 to ∼300 mm NaCl, whereas substitution of Lys-15 and Lys-24 resulted in very modest increases of about a 1.2-fold in Keq at 150 mm NaCl with diminishing differences at lower NaCl concentrations. Because multiple acetylation events often occur together on the same tail, we next examined multiple Lys → Gln substitutions in the H2B tail domain. Surprisingly, combinations of 4 or 6 Lys → Gln substitutions within the same tail (H2B S6CK5Q,K12Q,K15Q,K20Q (H2B S6C4KQ) and H2B S6CK5Q,K12Q,K15Q,K20Q,K24Q,K27Q (H2B S6C6KQ)) in NCPs did not result in further significant changes in the conformational equilibrium constant Keq at any [NaCl] examined (Fig. 3, C and D). Because k3′, reflecting the intrinsic rate of cysteine reactivity, was nearly identical for all S6C glutamine substitution mutan"

In resistant tomato leaves, AvrPtoB acts as an avirulence protein by interacting with the host Pto kinase and eliciting the host immune response. Pto-mediated immunity requires Prf, a Pto-interacting protein with a putative nucleotide-binding site and a region of leucine-rich repeats. In susceptible tomato plants, which lack either Pto or Prf, AvrPtoB acts as a virulence protein by promoting P. syringae pv. tomato growth and enhancing symptoms associated with bacterial speck disease. The N-terminal 307 amino acids of AvrPtoB (designated AvrPtoB1–307) are sufficient for these virulence activities and for Pto-mediated avirulence. We report that AvrPtoB is phosphorylated by a Pto- and Prf-independent kinase activity that is conserved in several plant species, including tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), Nicotiana benthamiana, and Arabidopsis thaliana. AvrPtoB1–307 was phosphorylated in tomato protoplasts, and mass spectrometry identified serine 258 as the major in vivo phosphorylation site of this protein. An alanine substitution of Ser258 resulted in the loss of virulence and the diminution of avirulence activity of AvrPtoB1–307, whereas a phosphomimetic S258D mutant had activities similar to wild type AvrPtoB1–307. These observations suggest that AvrPtoB has evolved to mimic a substrate of a conserved plant kinase, leading to enhancement of its virulence and avirulence activities in the host cell.

Pathogens of plants have evolved strategies to evade or suppress both basal and R (resistance) gene-mediated host defenses (1Abramovitch R.B. Anderson J.C. Martin G.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). For example, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst), 2The abbreviations used are: Pst, P. syringae pv. tomato; HA, hemagglutinin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ESI, electrospray ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem MS; RG, Rio Grande.2The abbreviations used are: Pst, P. syringae pv. tomato; HA, hemagglutinin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ESI, electrospray ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem MS; RG, Rio Grande. the causative organism of bacterial speck disease in tomato, uses its type III secretion system to deliver ∼30 “effector” proteins into the plant cell (1Abramovitch R.B.

These sequence-diverse proteins are collectively essential for pathogenesis, and many appear to have functionally redundant roles in promoting bacterial virulence (4Lin N.-C. Martin G.B. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2005; 18: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Mounting evidence suggests that a major function of type III effectors is the suppression of the plant basal defenses that are induced following detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by host pattern recognition receptors (5Chisholm S.T. Coaker G. Day B. Staskawicz B.J. Cell. 2006; 124: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar, 6He P. Shan L. Lin N.C. Martin G.B. Kemmerling B. Nurnberger T. Sheen J.

Pathogen-associated molecular patterns are structurally conserved and functionally indispensable in both pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria and reveal the presence of a potential danger to the plant upon recognition by pattern recognition receptors (9Zipfel C. Felix G. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).To overcome the suppression of basal defense by type III effectors, plants have evolved R genes that encode proteins that directly or indirectly recognize certain effectors thereby activating a strong plant immune response (10Martin G.B. Bogdanove A.J. Sessa G. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 23-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). R gene-mediated defense is usually associated with rapid localized cell death known as the hypersensitive response (11Greenberg J.T. Yao N. Cell Microbiol. 2004; 6: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Effectors which are detected by plant R proteins are referred to as avirulence (Avr) proteins. In response to this host surveillance mechanism, bacteria have evolved additional effectors to interfere with hypersensitive response-associated plant immunity (12Jamir Y. Guo M. Oh H.S.

Nature. 2007; 448: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Type III effector proteins therefore play a central role in plant-pathogen interactions, and it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms they employ to manipulate host defense responses (1Abramovitch R.B. Anderson J.C. Martin G.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 3Grant S.R. Fisher E.J. Chang J.H. Mole B.M. Dangl J.L. Annu. Rev.

PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: 1-13Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar).Type III effector proteins function within the plant cell, and interestingly, many of them appear to be post-translationally modified by host enzymes. For example, effectors have been reported to be acylated, phosphorylated, or proteolytically cleaved after their delivery into plant cells (8Alfano J.R. Collmer A. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2004; 42: 385-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 16Angot A. Vergunst A. Genin S. Peeters N. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: 1-13Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 17Mudgett M.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2005; 56: 509-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In some cases, these post-translational modifications have been shown to be important for the function of effectors in the host cell. For example, effectors AvrPto, AvrRpm1, and AvrB are myristylated, and this modification promotes their localization to the plasma membrane, which is critical for the avirulence activity of all three effectors and for the virulence activity of AvrPto and AvrRpm1 (18Shan L. Thara V.K. Martin G.B. Zhou J.M. Tang X. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2323-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 19Nimchuk Z. Marois E. Kjemtrup S. Leister R.T. Katagiri F. Dangl J.L. Cell. 2000; 101: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Pseudomonas effectors AvrPto and AvrB are both phosphorylated by host kinases, and this alteration is required for their full avirulence and virulence activities (20Desveaux D. Singer A.U. Wu A.J.

Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recently, two type III effectors from Rhizobium strain NGR234, NopL and NopP, have been shown to be phosphorylated by plant extracts (22Skorpil P. Saad M.M. Boukli N.M. Kobayashi H. Ares-Orpel F.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Both NopL and NopP are required for the nodulation ability of NGR234 on certain legumes, but it is unknown yet whether phosphorylation is involved in this function.In the interaction between Pst strain DC3000 and tomato plants, resistance is conferred by the host R protein Pto, a serine/threonine kinase (25Martin G.B. Brommonschenkel S.H. Chunwongse J. Frary A. Ganal M.W. Spivey R. Wu T. Earle E.D. Tanksley S.D. Science. 1993; 262: 1432-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar, 26Pedley K.F. Martin G.B. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2003; 41: 215-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Although molecular details of the recognition mechanism are unknown, Pto physically interacts with either of two Pst DC3000 effectors, AvrPto or AvrPtoB, and activates immunity by interacting with the host protein Prf, an NB-ARC LRR protein (26Pedley K.F.

Moreover, in this case AvrPto and AvrPtoB act as virulence factors promoting bacterial growth and inducing ethylene biosynthesis, which promotes disease-associated host cell death (4Lin N.-C.

Pascuzzi P.E. Xiao F. Sessa G. Martin G.B. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The N terminus-dependent myristylation is critical for plasma membrane localization of AvrPto and indispensable for virulence activity and for eliciting Pto/Prf-mediated immunity (18Shan L. Thara V.K. Martin G.B. Zhou J.M. Tang X. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2323-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 21Anderson J.C. Pascuzzi P.E. Xiao F. Sessa G. Martin G.B. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of AvrPto occurs at serine 149 located in the C-terminal region of AvrPto (21Anderson J.C. Pascuzzi P.E. Xiao F. Sessa G. Martin G.B. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). An alanine substitution at Ser149 significantly decreased AvrPto virulence activity and partially compromised its ability to elicit Pto/Prf-mediated immunity, suggesting that phosphorylation of this residue plays an important role in AvrPto function (21Anderson J.C. Pascuzzi P.E. Xiao F. Sessa G. Martin G.B. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).AvrPtoB was originally identified as an avirulence protein based on its ability to trigger immunity on resistant tomato plants expressing Pto and Prf (34Kim Y.-J. Lin N.-C. Martin G.B. Cell. 2002; 109: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). AvrPtoB was later found to have two distinct avirulence determinants, both of which are in the N-terminal region of AvrPtoB. One, contained within the first 307 amino acids of the protein (AvrPtoB1–307), is recognized by the Pto kinase (13Abramovitch R.B. Kim Y.-J. Chen S. Dickman M.B. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The other requires the additional amino acids 308–387 (AvrPtoB1–387) and is recognized by the Fen kinase (13Abramovitch R.B. Kim Y.-J. Chen S. Dickman M.B. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 15Rosebrock T.R. Zeng L. Brady J.J. Abramovitch R.B. Xiao F. Martin G.B. Nature. 2007; 448: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).AvrPtoB is a modular protein with both pathogenicity and virulence activities. The C-terminal region is an E3 ligase that acts as a pathogenicity factor by ubiquitinating the host R protein Fen, thereby promoting its degradation and causing disease susceptibility (15Rosebrock T.R. Zeng L. Brady J.J. Abramovitch R.B. Xiao F. Martin G.B. Nature. 2007; 448: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 35Abramovitch R.B. Janjusevic R. Stebbins C.E. Martin G.B. Proc. Natl.

Science. 2006; 311: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region has two distinct virulence activities (33Xiao, F., He, P., Abramovitch, R. B., Dawson, J. E., Nicholson, L. K., Sheen, J., and Martin, G. B. (2007) Plant J., 10.111/j.1365-313x.2007.03259.xGoogle Scholar). In susceptible tomato plants (lacking either Pto or Prf), AvrPtoB1–307 is sufficient for promoting bacterial growth and enhancing disease symptoms associated with increased ethylene production (33Xiao, F., He, P., Abramovitch, R. B., Dawson, J. E., Nicholson, L. K., Sheen, J., and Martin, G. B. (2007) Plant J., 10.111/j.1365-313x.2007.03259.xGoogle Scholar). This ethylene-associated virulence is dependent on phenylalanine 173 in AvrPtoB. Substitution of an alanine for this residue abolishes the virulence activity of AvrPtoB1–307 (33Xiao, F., He, P., Abramovitch, R. B., Dawson, J. E., Nicholson, L. K., Sheen, J., and Martin, G. B. (2007) Plant J., 10.111/j.1365-313x.2007.03259.xGoogle Scholar). AvrPtoB residues 308–387 are required for a second virulence activity that involves the suppression of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity in Arabidopsis (33Xiao, F., He, P., Abramovitch, R. B., Dawson, J. E., Nicholson, L. K., Sheen, J., and Martin, G. B. (2007) Plant J., 10.111/j.1365-313x.2007.03259.xGoogle Scholar).In susceptible tomato plants, the virulence activities of AvrPtoB1–307, AvrPtoB1–387, or the full-length AvrPtoB are indistinguishable (33Xiao, F., He, P., Abramovitch, R. B., Dawson, J. E., Nicholson, L. K., Sheen, J., and Martin, G. B. (2007) Plant J., 10.111/j.1365-313x.2007.03259.xGoogle Scholar), indicating that amino acids 308–553 either lack virulence activity in tomato or have an activity that is phenotypically redundant. Thus, AvrPtoB1–307 is sufficient both for eliciting Pto/Prf-dependent immunity in resistant tomato plants and for promoting bacterial virulence in susceptible tomato plants. Our primary interest in this work was the AvrPtoB virulence activity in tomato, and we therefore focused initially on AvrPtoB1–307.Here we report that AvrPtoB is phosphorylated by a Pto- and Prf-independent protein kinase activity that is conserved in a diverse array of plant species. We used mass spectrometry to identify the in vivo phosphorylated residue and demonstrate that this residue plays an important role in AvrPtoB1–307 virulence activity. Our data support the emerging theme that type III effector proteins have evolved to mimic substrates of certain host enzymes to manipulate host defense signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAvrPtoB Cloning and Mutagenesis—AvrPtoB1–307 tagged at the C terminus with a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was generated previously (33Xiao, F., He, P., Abramovitch, R. B., Dawson, J. E., Nicholson, L. K., Sheen, J., and Martin, G. B. (2007) Plant J., 10.111/j.1365-313x.2007.03259.xGoogle Scholar). AvrPtoB1–307 S258A and S258D mutants were generated using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the following primers: 5′-AGACGCCGGTCGACAGGGCCCCGCCACGCGTCAACCAAAG-3′; 5′-CTTTGGTTGACGCGTGGCGGGGCCCTGTCGACCGGCGTCT, and 5′-AGACGCCGGTCGACAGGGACCCGCCACGCGTCAACCAAAG-3′; and 5′-CTTTGGTTGACGCGTGGCGGGTCCCTGTCGACCGGCGTCT-3′.In Vitro Phosphorylation Assay of AvrPtoB—AvrPtoB was expressed in bacteria as a fusion protein in-frame with the C terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and purified as described previously using a glutathione-Sepharose resin (21Anderson J.C. Pascuzzi P.E. Xiao F. Sessa G. Martin G.B. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Five leaf discs (∼100 mg) from each plant species were ground in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10 μl/ml plant protease inhibitor mixture (Product 9599; Sigma-Aldrich)). Plant extracts were centrifuged at 8000 × g for 3 min, and 10 μg of the protein extract was used for an in vitro phosphorylation assay, which was performed with 10 μg of AvrPtoB-GST protein in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at room temperature, followed by SDS-PAGE separation and autoradiography.In Vivo 32P Labeling of AvrPtoB—HA-tagged AvrPtoB1–307 or its derivatives were transiently expressed in RG-prf3 tomato protoplasts by polyethylene glycol-mediated transformation (33Xiao, F., He, P., Abramovitch, R. B., Dawson, J. E., Nicholson, L. K., Sheen, J., and Martin, G. B. (2007) Plant J., 10.111/j.1365-313x.2007.03259.xGoogle Scholar). [32P]Orthophosphate (0.1mCi/ml) was added to the protoplasts 1 h after polyethylene glycol treatment and incubation continued for another 7 h in the dark. Protoplasts were collected and lysed with 1 ml of protoplast lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 10 μl/ml plant protease and phosphatase inhibitor I cocktails (Product 2850; Sigma-Aldrich)). AvrPtoB1–307-HA and derivatives were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche Applied Science) and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by vacuum drying of the gel and autoradiography.Mass Spectrometry Analysis—100 μg of plasmid expressing HA-tagged AvrPtoB1–307 was transformed into 1 ml of RG-prf3 protoplasts (about 2 × 105 cells) and incubated for 9 h in the dark. Transformed protoplasts were collected and lysed with 1 ml of protoplast lysis buffer. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was incubated with 100 μl of anti-HA affinity matrix at 4 °C for 4 h. The immunoprecipitation-complex was separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250. AvrPtoB1–307-HA was excised from the gel and sent for mass spectrometry analysis at the Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Facility (Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, St. Louis, MO). The nano-ESI-MS/MS analysis was performed exactly as described previously (21Anderson J.C. Pascuzzi P.E. Xiao F. Sessa G. Martin G.B. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Pseudomonas Protein Secretion and Western Blotting Assays—pCPP45 plasmids harboring avrPtoB1–307 or its derivatives were transformed into the DC3000ΔavrPtoΔavrPtoB strain by electroporation. The resulting strains were grown in minimal medium for 24 h at 18 °C, and secreted proteins were detected by standard Western blotting as described previously (37Lin N.C. Abramovitch R.B. Kim Y.J. Martin G.B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The antibodies used for Western blotting were anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), anti-NptII (U.S. Biological Corp.), or anti-AvrPtoB (37Lin N.C. Abramovitch R.B. Kim Y.J. Martin G.B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Detection of proteins was carried out using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL Plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences).Measurement of Bacterial Populations in Tomato Leaves—Two genotypes of Rio Grande (RG) tomato lines were used: RG-PtoR (Pto/Pto, Prf/Prf) and RG-prf3 (Pto/Pto, prf/prf) (28Salmeron J.M. Oldroyd G.E.D. Rommens C.M.T. Scofield S.R. Kim H.-S. Lavelle D.T. Dahlbeck D. Staskawicz B.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The method used to prepare P. syringae pv. tomato inoculum has been described previously (21Anderson J.C. Pascuzzi P.E. Xiao F. Sessa G. Martin G.B. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Five- to six-week-old greenhouse grown plants were vacuum-infiltrated with different P. syringae pv. tomato strains at an inoculum level of 104 colony-forming units/ml and maintained in a climate-controlled growth chamber under optimized conditions (see Ref. 21Anderson J.C. Pascuzzi P.E. Xiao F. Sessa G. Martin G.B. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar for details). Bacterial populations in tomato leaves were measured at 2 or 4 days after infiltration. For consistency, day 2 samples were collected from the third and fourth leaves from the bottom of the plants. To assess the effect of Ser258 substitutions on the virulence and avirulence activities of AvrPtoB1–307 and mutants, analysis of variance of bacterial populations on plants was based on the pooled data from three experiments using the general linear model procedure of a statistical analysis system (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The least significance difference at a 0.05 probability level was used to test the differences between means.RESULTSTo examine whether AvrPtoB is phosphorylated, we first adopted the in vitro phosphorylation assay, previously used for AvrPto, to test whether AvrPtoB could be phosphorylated by tomato leaf extracts (21Anderson J.C. Pascuzzi P.E. Xiao F. Sessa G. Martin G.B. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recombinant AvrPtoB fused to GST was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified with a glutathione-Sepharose resin. The in vitro phosphorylation assay of AvrPtoB was performed in the presence of leaf extracts from resistant tomato RG-PtoR leaves (Pto/Pto, Prf/Prf) that express a functional Pto kinase. We observed incorporation of 32P into GST-AvrPtoB and not GST alone in the presence of leaf extracts (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). GST-AvrPtoB without leaf extracts or RG-PtoR leaf extracts without AvrPtoB showed no evidence of 32P incorporation in this assay (Fig. 1). These observations indicated that AvrPtoB can be phosphorylated by a kinase activity present in RG-PtoR tomato leaves.To assess whether phosphorylation of AvrPtoB is dependent on the Pto or Prf proteins that function to recognize the effector, we used leaf extracts from RG-pto11 (pto/pto Prf/Prf) or RG-prf3 (Pto/Pto prf/prf) plants for the in vitro phosphorylation analysis of AvrPtoB. RG-pto11 plants lack a functional Pto kinase because of a point mutation in the Pto gene, whereas RG-prf3 plants have a 1-kb deletion in the Prf gene rendering the plants susceptible to avirulent Pst strains despite their having a functional Pto gene (28Salmeron J.M. Oldroyd G.E.D. Rommens C.M.T. Scofield S.R. Kim H.-S. Lavelle D.T. Dahlbeck D. Staskawicz B.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Leaf extracts from both RG-pto11 and RG-prf3 plants phosphorylated AvrPtoB as well as RG-PtoR leaf extracts did (Fig. 1). We further tested whether the kinase activity responsible for AvrPtoB phosphorylation is conserved in other plant species. Leaf extracts from the wild tobacco species Nicotiana benthamiana or Arabidopsis thaliana were tested, and both were found able to phosphorylate AvrPtoB (Fig. 1). Thus, AvrPtoB is phosphorylated by a Pto- or Prf-independent kinase activity that is conserved in several plant species.We narrowed our initial focus to AvrPtoB1–307 because this region is recognized by Pto/Prf and is the minimal fragment in tomato with virulence activity. To test whether this region is phosphorylated in vivo, we developed a construct expressing AvrPtoB1–307 with a C-terminal HA tag and transiently transformed it into RG-prf3 protoplasts in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate. AvrPtoB1–307-HA was then immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody and subjected to SDS-PAGE to monitor the phosphorylation of AvrPtoB1–307 as indicated by incorporation of 32P. AvrPtoB1–307 appeared as single 32P-labeled band (Fig. 2), indicating that the N-terminal domain of AvrPtoB is phosphorylated in plant cells.FIGURE 2In vivo phosphorylation of AvrPtoB1–307 in plant cells. AvrPtoB1–307 with a C-terminal HA epitope tag was expressed in tomato RG-prf3 protoplasts by polyethylene glycol-mediated transformation in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate. AvrPtoB1–307-HA was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA affinity matrix, followed by SDS-PAGE separation and autoradiography. AvrPtoB1–307-HA incorporated [32P]phosphate (top panel). The identity of AvrPtoB1–307-HA band was confirmed by Western blotting (WB) with an anti-HA antibody using a small amount of lysate before immunoprecipitation (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To characterize the in vivo phosphorylation site of AvrPtoB1–307, we performed nano-ESI-MS/MS on the phosphorylated protein. AvrPtoB1–307-HA or an empty vector control were expressed in RG-prf3 tomato protoplasts, the proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Staining of this gel revealed a putative AvrPtoB1–307-HA band that was absent from the empty vector control (Fig. 3A). This band was excised from the gel for tryptic in-gel digestion and subjected to nano-ESI-MS/MS analysis. The resulting MS and MS/MS spectra were searched against the NCBInr data base using the Mascot software tool and revealed a clear identification of AvrPtoB as the protein present in this gel band (Fig. 3B). The protein was represented by several peptides providing an overall sequence coverage of ∼65% (Fig. 3B). Among the identified peptides one was selected for MS/MS because it represented a single triply charged precursor with a mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio of 617.57, which matches the m/z of a singly phosphorylated peptide from AvrPtoB (namely amino acids 245–261; SSNTAASQTPVDRSPPR). A series of y-ions and several b-ion fragments revealed serine 258 to be the phosphorylated amino acid residue in this peptide (Fig. 3, C and D).FIGURE 3Identification of the in vivo phosphorylation site of AvrPtoB1–307 by mass spectrometry.

https://openalex.org/W1996211676,"Tangier disease is an inherited disorder that results in a deficiency in circulating levels of HDL. Although the disease is known to be caused by mutations in the ABCA1 gene, the mechanism by which lesions in the ABCA1 ATPase effect this outcome is not known. The inability of ABCA1 knockout mice (ABCA1-/-) to load cholesterol and phospholipids onto apoA1 led to a proposal that ABCA1 mediates the transbilayer externalization of phospholipids, an activity integral not only to the formation of HDL particles but also to another, distinct process: the recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages. Expression of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of both macrophages and their apoptotic targets is required for efficient engulfment of the apoptotic cells, and it has been proposed that ABCA1 is required for transbilayer externalization of PS to the surface of both cell types. To determine whether ABCA1 is responsible for any of the catalytic activities known to control transbilayer phospholipid movements, these activities were measured in cells from ABCA1-/- mice and from Tangier individuals as well as ABCA1-expressing HeLa cells. Phospholipid movements in either normal or apoptotic lymphocytes or in macrophages were not inhibited when cells from knockout and wildtype mice or immortalized cells from Tangier individuals vs normal individuals were compared. Exposure of PS on the surface of normal thymocytes, apoptotic thymocytes and elicited peritoneal macrophages from wildtype and knockout mice or B lymphocytes from normal and Tangier individuals, as measured by annexin V binding, was also unchanged. No evidence was found of ABCA1-stimulated active PS export, and spontaneous PS movement to the outer leaflet in the presence or absence of apoA1 was unaffected by the presence or absence of ABCA1. Normal or Tangier B lymphocytes and macrophages were also identical in their ability to serve as targets or phagocytes, respectively, in apoptotic cell clearance assays. No evidence was found to support the suggestion that ABCA1 is involved in transport to the macrophage cell surface of annexins I and II, known to enhance phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. These results show that mutations in ABCA1 do not measurably reduce the rate of transbilayer movements of phospholipids in either the engulfing macrophage or the apoptotic target, thus discounting catalysis of transbilayer movements of phospholipids as the mechanism by which ABCA1 facilitates loading of phospholipids and cholesterol onto apoA1."
https://openalex.org/W1993519805,"Copy number alterations (CNAs) in genomic DNA have been associated with complex human diseases, including cancer. One of the most common techniques to detect CNAs is array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). The availability of aCGH platforms and the need for identification of CNAs has resulted in a wealth of methodological studies.ADaCGH is an R package and a web-based application for the analysis of aCGH data. It implements eight methods for detection of CNAs, gains and losses of genomic DNA, including all of the best performing ones from two recent reviews (CBS, GLAD, CGHseg, HMM). For improved speed, we use parallel computing (via MPI). Additional information (GO terms, PubMed citations, KEGG and Reactome pathways) is available for individual genes, and for sets of genes with altered copy numbers.ADACGH represents a qualitative increase in the standards of these types of applications: a) all of the best performing algorithms are included, not just one or two; b) we do not limit ourselves to providing a thin layer of CGI on top of existing BioConductor packages, but instead carefully use parallelization, examining different schemes, and are able to achieve significant decreases in user waiting time (factors up to 45x); c) we have added functionality not currently available in some methods, to adapt to recent recommendations (e.g., merging of segmentation results in wavelet-based and CGHseg algorithms); d) we incorporate redundancy, fault-tolerance and checkpointing, which are unique among web-based, parallelized applications; e) all of the code is available under open source licenses, allowing to build upon, copy, and adapt our code for other software projects."
https://openalex.org/W1990291893,"Automated DNA sequencing technology is so rapid that analysis has become the rate-limiting step. Hundreds of prokaryotic genome sequences are publicly available, with new genomes uploaded at the rate of approximately 20 per month. As a result, this growing body of genome sequences will include microorganisms not previously identified, isolated, or observed. We hypothesize that evolutionary pressure exerted by an ecological niche selects for a similar genetic repertoire in those prokaryotes that occupy the same niche, and that this is due to both vertical and horizontal transmission. To test this, we have developed a novel method to classify prokaryotes, by calculating their Pfam protein domain distributions and clustering them with all other sequenced prokaryotic species. Clusters of organisms are visualized in two dimensions as 'mountains' on a topological map. When compared to a phylogenetic map constructed using 16S rRNA, this map more accurately clusters prokaryotes according to functional and environmental attributes. We demonstrate the ability of this map, which we term a ""niche map"", to cluster according to ecological niche both quantitatively and qualitatively, and propose that this method be used to associate uncharacterized prokaryotes with their ecological niche as a means of predicting their functional role directly from their genome sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2048625734,"WASP and its binding partner WIP play important roles in T cells both in actin polymerization and in interleukin-2 transcription. Aberrations thereof contribute to the pathology of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). To directly evaluate the cooperativity of WIP and WASP in interleukin-2 transcription, we investigated how the WIP-WASP complex regulates NF-AT-mediated gene transcription. We developed an improved model system for analysis, using WIP and WASP cotransfection into Jurkat cells, in which strong induction of NFAT reporter activation is observed with anti-T cell receptor (TCR) antibody without the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate usually used previously. Using this system, our findings contradict a prevailing conceptual model of TCR-induced WIP-WASP dissociation by showing in three ways that the WIP-WASP complex mediates TCR-induced NFAT activation without dissociation. First, phosphorylation of WIP Ser488 does not cause dissociation of the WIP-WASP complex. Second, WIP-WASP complexes do not dissociate demonstrably after TCR stimulation. Third, a fusion protein of WIP to WASP efficiently mediates NFAT activation. Next, our studies clarify that WIP stabilization of WASP explains otherwise unexpected results in TCR-induced NFAT activation. Finally, we find that the NH2 terminus of WIP is a highly inhibitory region for TCR-mediated transcriptional activation in which at least two elements contribute: the NH2-terminal polyproline and the NH2-terminal actin-binding WH2 domain. This suggests that WIP, like WASP, is subject to autoinhibition. Our data indicate that the WIP-WASP complex plays an important role in WASP stabilization and NFAT activation."
https://openalex.org/W2083368648,"State transitions in the nervous system often take shape as traveling waves, whereby one neural state is replaced by another across space in a wave-like manner. In visual perception, transitions between the two mutually exclusive percepts that alternate when the two eyes view conflicting stimuli (binocular rivalry) may also take shape as traveling waves. The properties of these waves point to a neural substrate of binocular rivalry alternations that have the hallmark signs of lower cortical areas. In a series of experiments, we show a potent interaction between traveling waves in binocular rivalry and stimulus motion. The course of the traveling wave is biased in the motion direction of the suppressed stimulus that gains dominance by means of the wave-like transition. Thus, stimulus motion may propel the traveling wave across the stimulus to the extent that the stimulus motion dictates the traveling wave's direction completely. Using a computational model, we show that a speed-dependent asymmetry in lateral inhibitory connections between retinotopically organized and motion-sensitive neurons can explain our results. We argue that such a change in suppressive connections may play a vital role in the resolution of dynamic occlusion situations."
https://openalex.org/W1967504612,"Because binding of RNAP to misplaced sites could compromise the efficiency of transcription, natural selection for the optimization of gene expression should regulate the distribution of DNA motifs capable of RNAP-binding across the genome. Here we analyze the distribution of the −10 promoter motifs that bind the σ70 subunit of RNAP in 42 bacterial genomes. We show that selection on these motifs operates across the genome, maintaining an over-representation of −10 motifs in regulatory sequences while eliminating them from the nonfunctional and, in most cases, from the protein coding regions. In some genomes, however, −10 sites are over-represented in the coding sequences; these sites could induce pauses effecting regulatory roles throughout the length of a transcriptional unit. For nonfunctional sequences, the extent of motif under-representation varies across genomes in a manner that broadly correlates with the number of tRNA genes, a good indicator of translational speed and growth rate. This suggests that minimizing the time invested in gene transcription is an important selective pressure against spurious binding. However, selection against spurious binding is detectable in the reduced genomes of host-restricted bacteria that grow at slow rates, indicating that components of efficiency other than speed may also be important. Minimizing the number of RNAP molecules per cell required for transcription, and the corresponding energetic expense, may be most relevant in slow growers. These results indicate that genome-level properties affecting the efficiency of transcription and translation can respond in an integrated manner to optimize gene expression. The detection of selection against promoter motifs in nonfunctional regions also confirms previous results indicating that no sequence may evolve free of selective constraints, at least in the relatively small and unstructured genomes of bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2031015736,"Background Although STAT5 promotes survival of hematopoietic progenitors, STAT5−/− mice develop mild neutrophilia. Methodology/Principal findings Here, we show that in STAT5−/− mice, liver endothelial cells (LECs) autonomously secrete high amounts of G-CSF, allowing myeloid progenitors to overcompensate for their intrinsic survival defect. However, when injected with pro-inflammatory cytokines, mutant mice cannot further increase neutrophil production, display a severe deficiency in peripheral neutrophil survival, and are therefore unable to maintain neutrophil homeostasis. In wild-type mice, inflammatory stimulation induces rapid STAT5 degradation in LECs, G-CSF production by LECs and other cell types, and then sustained mobilization and expansion of long-lived neutrophils. Conclusion We conclude that STAT5 is an ambivalent factor. In cells of the granulocytic lineage, it exerts an antiapoptotic function that is required for maintenance of neutrophil homeostasis, especially during the inflammatory response. In LECs, STAT5 negatively regulates granulopoiesis by directly or indirectly repressing G-CSF expression. Removal of this STAT5-imposed brake contributes to induction of emergency granulopoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W2087893647,"Agrin is a basement membrane protein crucial for development and maintenance of the neuromuscular junction in vertebrates. The C. elegans genome harbors a putative agrin gene agr-1. We have cloned the corresponding cDNA to determine the primary structure of the protein and expressed its recombinant fragments to raise specific antibodies. The domain organization of AGR-1 is very similar to the vertebrate orthologues. C. elegans agrin contains a signal sequence for secretion, seven follistatin domains, three EGF-like repeats and two laminin G domains. AGR-1 loss of function mutants did not exhibit any overt phenotypes and did not acquire resistance to the acetylcholine receptor agonist levamisole. Furthermore, crossing them with various mutants for components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex with impaired muscle function did not lead to an aggravation of the phenotypes. Promoter-GFP translational fusion as well as immunostaining of worms revealed expression of agrin in buccal epithelium and the protein deposition in the basal lamina of the pharynx. Furthermore, dorsal and ventral IL1 head neurons and distal tip cells of the gonad arms are sources of agrin production, but no expression was detectable in body muscles or in the motoneurons innervating them. Recombinant worm AGR-1 fragment is able to cluster vertebrate dystroglycan in cultured cells, implying a conservation of this interaction, but since neither of these proteins is expressed in muscle of C. elegans, this interaction may be required in different tissues. The connections between muscle cells and the basement membrane, as well as neuromuscular junctions, are structurally distinct between vertebrates and nematodes."
https://openalex.org/W2062317101,"The Cdc7 serine/threonine kinase activates the initiation of DNA replication by phosphorylating MCM proteins that are bound to the origins of DNA replication. We reported previously that human Cdc7 nuclear import is mediated directly by importin-β through its binding to the Cdc7 nuclear localization sequence (NLS). Here, we report that human Cdc7 nuclear localization is regulated by two additional elements: nuclear retention (NRS) and export sequences (NES). Cdc7 proteins imported into the nucleus are retained in the nucleus by associating with chromatin, for which NRS-(306–326) is essential. Importantly, this binding appears to be specific to the origin of DNA replication, because the binding of wild-type Cdc7 to origin is 2.4-fold higher than to non-origin DNA. Furthermore, an NRS-defective Cdc7 mutant could not be retained in the nucleus, although it was imported into the nucleus normally. Together, our data suggest that NRS plays an important role in the activation of DNA replication by Cdc7. The Cdc7 proteins unassociated with chromatin are bound by CRM1 via two NES elements: NES1 at 458–467 within kinase insert III, and NES2 at 545–554 within the kinase IX domain. The primary function of the Cdc7-CRM1 association may be to translocate nuclear Cdc7 to the cytoplasm.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4459-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore, the catalytic Cdc7 and the regulatory Dbf4 subunits must enter the nucleus and bind to chromatin at an ori prior to the activation of replication initiation. Human Cdc7 (huCdc7) protein comprises 11 kinase domains and two kinase inserts (17Jiang W. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14320-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Sato N. Arai K. Masai H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4340-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The kinase domains are highly conserved in all species from yeast to human, while the amino acid sequences of Kinase Insert II (amino acids, 275–368) and III (440–538) are more diverse (existence of Kinase Insert I is not yet clear). Therefore, it was previously suggested that kinase inserts may play regulatory functions (15Masai H. Sato N. Takeda T. Arai K. Front Biosci. 1999; 4: D834-D840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this prediction, we reported previously that importin-β binds to Cdc7 at its Kinase Insert II and induces Cdc7 import into the nucleus (19Kim B.J. Lee H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12041-12049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Masai and co-workers (12Kim J.M. Yamada M. Masai H. Mutat. Res. 2003; 532: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Sato N. Sato M. Nakayama M. Saitoh R. Arai K. Masai H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) demonstrated that huCdc7 associates with chromatin immediately after reformation of the nuclear membrane in early G1, while association of Dbf4 with chromatin occurs in late G1. This observation suggests that the association of Cdc7 with chromatin is independent of Dbf4 in human cells. However, the mechanism how Cdc7 binds to chromatin to activate DNA replication in mammalian cells is presently unknown. Here, we report that huCdc7 nuclear localization is regulated by nuclear import, chromatin binding, and nuclear export. These three regulation steps are mediated by nuclear localization sequence (NLS), nuclear retention sequence (NRS), and nuclear export sequence (NES), respectively. The nuclear retention sequence (amino acids 306–326) is present within the previously identified NLS-(203–370). We show here for the first time that huCdc7 binds to chromatin at an ori, for which the NRS is essential. The huCdc7 NES comprises two leucinerich motifs within the C-terminal region. Although each NES motif can mediate nuclear export at low efficiency, both NES1 and 2 elements are required for an effective Cdc7 nuclear export to the cytoplasm. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa and HEK 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's-modified Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and gentamycin (50 μg/ml) (Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in Minimal Essential Medium supplemented with 10% Fetal Clone II (HyClone). Cells grown on a glass coverslip were transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine PLUS™as suggested by the supplier (Invitrogen). Plasmid Constructs—The pEGFP·huCdc7 recombinant plasmid was constructed by cloning a full-length cDNA encoding the entire human Cdc7 into the SmaI site of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) (19Kim B.J. Lee H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12041-12049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Various Cdc7 deletion mutants were generated by PCR-based cloning using pfu DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Alternatively, DNA fragments generated by digestion with restriction endonuclease(s) were cloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). The substitutions of amino acid sequence from a leucine to an alanine within Cdc7 NESs were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. The following oligonucleotides (all from IDT, Coralville, IA) were used for mutagenesis: sense 5′-GAAAACTCTGTGAGAGAGCCAGGGGTATGGATTCTAG-3′ and antisense 5′-CTAGAATCCATACCCCTGGCTCTCTCACAGAGTTTTC-3′ for the L465A mutant; sense 5′-GACCTGCTTGATAAAGCTGCAGATCTAAATCCAGC-3′ and antisense 5′-GCTGGATTTAGATCTGCAGCTTTATCAAGCAGGTC-3′ for the L549A/K550A double point mutant. To generate mutants for the nuclear export studies, the following oligos were used to generate double-stranded DNAs: pEGFP·Cdc7NES1, 5′-TCGATTGAGAAAACTCTGTGAGAGACTCAGGGGT-3′ and 5′-GATCACCCCTGAGTCTCTCACAGAGTTTTCTCAA-3′ (encompassing amino acids 458–467, LRKLCERLRG); and pEGFP·Cdc7NES2, 5′-TCGACTGCTTGATAAACTTCTAGATCTAAATCCA-3′ and 5′-GATCTGGATTTAGATCTAGAAGTTTATCAAGCAG-3′ (encompassing 545–554, LLDKLLDLNP). Double-stranded DNAs from these complementary single-stranded oligos were generated by hybridization in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, EDTA 0.1 mm (pH 7.4). Subsequently, the double strands were ligated into the XhoI-BamHI site of pEGFP-C1. To create pEGFP·Cdc7NES1·NES2, two steps were taken. First, a double-stranded DNA was generated by hybridization of 5′-TCGATTGAGAAAACTCTGTGAGAGACTCAGGGGTAG-3′ and 5′-AATTCTACCCCTGAGTCTCTCACAGAGTTTTCTCAA-3′ (NES1 portion). Second, the NES1 portion was ligated to an NES2 double-stranded DNA generated from 5′-AATTCTGCTTGATAAACTTCTAGATCTAAATCCA-3′ and 5′-GATCTGGATTTAGATCTAGAAGTTTATCAAGCAG-3. Subsequently, the Cdc7NES1·NES2 fragment was cloned into the XhoI-BamHI site of pEGFP-C1. The pEGFP·MAPKKNES was constructed using 5′-TCGACTTCAAAAAAAACTTGAAGAACTTGAACTT-3′ and 5′-GATCAAGTTCAAGTTCTTCAAGTTTTTTTTGAAG-3′ (21Kanwal C. Li H. Lim C.S. AAPS. PharmSci. 2002; 4: E18Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To generate tandem GFP-tagged (2×GFP) constructs, pEGFP·Cdc7NES1, pEGFP·Cdc7NES2, pEGFP·Cdc7NES1·NES2, and pEGFP·MEKKNES were digested with AgeI and then ligated with a 790-bp fragment generated by double-digesting pEGFP-C1 with AgeI and XmaI. pGEX·huCdc7 recombinant plasmid was constructed as described previously (19Kim B.J. Lee H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12041-12049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Various Cdc7 deletion mutants were generated by cloning mutant DNA fragments into pGEX-2T or pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences). pGEX-KG·importin-β was described previously (19Kim B.J. Lee H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12041-12049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 22Moore J.D. Yang J. Truant R. Kornbluth S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). All the mutant constructs were verified by nucleotide sequencing. The protein expression of each construct was confirmed by Western blot analysis ( supplemental Fig. S1). Antibodies and Reagents—Antibodies generated against the following proteins were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA): MCM2 (N-19), GFP (B-2), Histone H1 (N-19), importin-β (C-19), and FITC-conjugated GST. Other antibodies and reagents were purchased from the following companies: anti-Cdc7 (K0070-3) and agarose conjugated anti-GFP (D153-8) antibodies, MBL International (Woburn, MA); anti-CRM1 antibodies, Santa Cruz Biotechnology (C-20) or BD Transduction Laboratories (611832); and Leptomycin B, Sigma. Protein Purification and the GST Pull-down Assay—Recombinant GST, GST·Cdc7, GST·Cdc7(Δ300–332), GST·Cdc7(Δ1–146), and GST·importin-β proteins were expressed in Escherichiacoli (BL21), and then purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B as suggested by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences) and described previously (19Kim B.J. Lee H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12041-12049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). GST pull-down assays were carried out using beads conjugated with either GST (negative control) or GST·importin-β recombinant proteins. Cells transfected with plasmids were lysed at 24 h post-transfection with Lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaF, 50 mm glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol plus protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysates were then incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads conjugated with GST or GST·importin-β. Indirect Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells grown on a glass coverslip were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min. After treatment with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature, cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 90 min, followed by three washes with PBS (5 min for each wash) and incubation with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies for 45 min at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were washed with PBS, mounted on a glass slide, and then visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Axiovert 100, Carl Zeiss). Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) was used to visualize the nuclei. Chromatin Association Assays—Chromatin fraction described in Fig. 3 was prepared as described previously with some modifications (23Liang C. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 24Macfarlan T. Kutney S. Altman B. Montross R. Yu J. Chakravarti D. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were lysed in the Nuclei Isolation buffer (NIB; 15 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture). After centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 5 min in a bench-top centrifuge (Eppendorf), the supernatant was saved (cytoplasmic extract, CE). Whole nuclei (WNE) were washed with NIB plus 0.6% Nonidet P-40, and then centrifuged for 3 min at 3,000 rpm in a bench-top centrifuge to separate the nuclear soluble (W1) and “insoluble” (P1) fractions. The P1 fraction was incubated with 10 units of micrococcal nuclease at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min in a bench-top centrifuge. The resultant supernatant was saved (W2), and pellet (P2) was resuspended in ice-cold 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. After centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 rpm in a bench-top centrifuge, the supernatant containing soluble chromatin with enriched actively replicating DNA was obtained (Chr). All samples were resolved in 2× SDS sample buffer containing 60 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, followed by Western blot analysis.FIGURE 3Analysis by cell fractionation confirmed that Cdc7 nuclear retention is mediated by its association with chromatin. A, detailed fractionation procedure is described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, Orc2 proteins were mostly found with the soluble chromatin fraction (Chr). Proteins isolated from WCE, CE, or Chr were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blotting with anti-Orc2, -MCM2, or histone H1 antibodies (WB) or Coomassie Blue staining (Coomassie). C, NRS-defective Cdc7(Δ300–332) mutant did not bind to chromatin. HeLa cells transfected with GFP·Cdc7 or GFP·Cdc7(Δ300–332) construct were treated with ethanol (control) or LMB for 4 h. The cells were then washed with PBS and fractionated as described in A. Each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE-Western blot analysis with anti-GFP or -histone H1 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An alternative protocol for protein-chromatin association (described in Fig. 2, A–C) was adopted from Martini et al. (26Martini E. Roche D.M. Marheineke K. Verreault A. Almouzni G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells grown on a glass coverslip were washed with PBS and extracted for 2 min at room temperature with high salt buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 6.9), 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 350 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture. After washing with PBS, cells were fixed (i.e. X100/PFA), paraformaldehyde washed off, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and incubated with purified recombinant GST·Cdc7 WT or GST·Cdc7 mutant proteins for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-GST antibodies for 50 min at room temperature, followed by three washes with PBS. When cells were fixed prior to the treatment of the cells with high salt extraction buffer containing Triton X-100 (see above) is defined as PFA/X100. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Cells transfected with expression plasmids for 12 h were cross-linked for 10 min with 1% formaldehyde, followed by three washes with cold PBS. Cells were then scraped off, resuspended in Lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture), and incubated on ice for 15 min. Subsequently, chromatin was fragmented by sonication on ice using a Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher Scientific), each for 10 s 8 times at 15% amplification. Soluble fractions were collected by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm in a bench-top centrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C, and were then diluted 10-fold with Dilution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture). The diluted fractions were incubated with agarose conjugated with anti-GFP antibody to immunoprecipitate GFP-tagged wild type (WT) and mutant Cdc7 proteins. The beads were washed twice with low-salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 150 mm NaCl), twice with high salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, and 500 mm NaCl), twice with LiCl buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.25 m LiCl, 1% Non-idet-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA), and three times with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 1 mm EDTA). All buffer used was supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. Approximately 10% of total beads were used for Western blot analysis, and the rest was incubated with Elution buffer (1.0% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3). The NaCl concentration of the eluted sample (i.e. protein-DNA complexes) was adjusted to 0.2 m, followed by incubation at 65 °C overnight. The sample was then further incubated with proteinase K (100 μg/ml) for 2 h at 45 °C. DNA was purified by phenol chloroform extraction and resuspended in DNase-free water, which was subjected to quantification by real-time PCR (7900HT, Applied Biosystems) using SYBR green master mix (Applied Biosystems). Standard curves were obtained from a serial dilution of HEK 293T genomic DNA (0.2, 1, 5, 10, and 50 ng) as template. The following primers at the origin of the MCM4 gene locus were used as described previously (27Ladenburger E.M. Keller C. Knippers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1036-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). UPR-F: 5′-AAACCAGAAGTAGGCCTCGCTCGG-3′ and UPR-R: 5′-GGCCAGTAAGCGCGCCTCTTTGG-3′. An exon 9 primer set was used as a negative control (EX9-F: 5′-ATGTCTTCCGGAGACTCCTGAAGC-3′ and EX9-R: 5′-GGCCTCCTATTCTCAGAATCATGC-3′) (27Ladenburger E.M. Keller C. Knippers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1036-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the case of endogenous huCdc7, fragmented chromatin was incubated with an anti-Cdc7 antibody at 4 °C overnight. Subsequently, chromatin-Cdc7 antibody complex was incubated with protein A- and G-agarose/salmon sperm DNA (Upstate) for 2 h. As a negative control, protein A- and G-agarose/salmon sperm DNA and mouse IgG were used. The beads were then washed as described above. Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—Cells were transfected with expression plasmids for 12 h, washed three times with PBS, resuspended with cold Lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture), and then incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with rotation. The supernatant was separated by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm in a bench-top centrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C, and was then incubated with agarose conjugated anti-GFP antibody at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed four times with cold Lysis buffer and resuspended in the SDS sample buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE Western blot analysis. Identification and Characterization of the Cdc7 NRS—We previously reported that the human Cdc7 Kinase Insert II domain (amino acids, 203–370) is required for its binding to importin-β, by which Cdc7 is imported into the nucleus. To further dissect Cdc7 NLS, we generated and characterized several mutant constructs bearing a series of deletions within the Kinase Insert II domain (Figs. 1A and supplemental S1A). We found that the mutant bearing a deletion from 300 to 332 (i.e. Cdc7(Δ300–332)) was localized in the cytoplasm (Figs. 1, A and B, and supplemental S2), suggesting this segment is critical for Cdc7 nuclear localization. To further specify a segment critical for nuclear localization, we generated and characterized several mutants bearing smaller deletions within the 300–332 segment. The Cdc7(Δ301–313) and Cdc7(Δ319–326) mutants were localized in the nucleus, while Cdc7(Δ301–326) was mainly in the cytoplasm, suggesting amino acids 314–318 is absolutely required for Cdc7 nuclear localization (Fig. 1, A and B). However, Cdc7(Δ306–313) was diffusedly localized throughout the entire cell (data not shown), suggesting that amino acids 314–318 is required but not sufficient for Cdc7 nuclear localization. The 306–326 segment may be the minimum sequence sufficient for Cdc7 nuclear retention since the Cdc7(Δ306–326) mutant was mostly localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1B). Nevertheless, considerable amount of Cdc7(Δ306–326) proteins was still detected in the nucleus. Therefore, we conclude that the 300–332 segment contains the intact Cdc7 NRS. We found previously that the binding of Cdc7 to importin-β is essential for its nuclear import. Therefore, we examined the binding affinity of Cdc7(Δ300–332) for importin-β. To our surprise, the binding affinity of this mutant for importin-β was not notably different from that of GFP·Cdc7 WT (Fig. 1C). This data raised the possibility that GFP·Cdc7(Δ300–332) mutant was normally imported into the nucleus by importin-β. However, the mutant protein could be localized mainly in the cytoplasm due to the lack of nuclear retention and subsequent nuclear export. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the nuclear localizations of Cdc7 WT and Cdc7(Δ300–332) mutant proteins after cells were treated with Leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of protein nuclear export by CRM1/exportin 1 (28Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar, 29Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, GFP·Cdc7(Δ300–332) protein was localized in the nucleus in the presence of LMB. These data, in conjunction with Fig. 1C (i.e. effective binding of Cdc7(Δ300–332) with importin-β), strongly suggest that the cytoplasmic localization of Cdc7(Δ300–332) is not due to defects in nuclear import but due to the combination of deficient nuclear retention and effective nuclear export. To gain a better understanding of Cdc7 nuclear retention, we examined the subcellular distribution patterns of the GFP·Cdc7(Δ300–332) mutant in a cohort of a cell population. As shown in Fig. 1E, GFP·Cdc7(Δ300–332) was exclusively localized in the nuclei of more than 60% of cells treated with LMB, compared with only 2% of the LMB-nontreated control. Interestingly, the same survey revealed that GFP·Cdc7(Δ300–332) was localized in the nuclei as well as in the cytoplasm of ∼40% cells with or without LMB treatments. Although the exact reason for this is presently unknown, it is possible that the nuclear import and export of GFP·Cdc7(Δ300–332) proteins are in equilibrium in a certain cell population (at a given time). Alternatively (or in combination), LMB might not be able to block the nuclear export of all the Cdc7(Δ300–332) proteins under certain conditions. Furthermore, part of the signals detected in the cytoplasm might be due to the presence of GFP·Cdc7(Δ300–332) cleavage products as shown in Fig. 1C (lane 3) (note that anti-GFP antibodies were used for the work shown in Fig. 1, C, lanes 1–3 and E). Cdc7 Nuclear Retention Is Mediated by Associating with Chromatin via Its NRS—We wanted to examine the subcellular localization of Cdc7(Δ300–332) mutant by an alternative approach. We therefore established a novel in vitro experimental system by removing all the cellular soluble proteins, and the plasma membrane while leaving the chromatin and nuclear matrix integrity largely intact. This was achieved by treating cells with Triton X-100 and removing the soluble cellular fraction as described under “Experimental Procedures.” If these “ghost nuclei” are incubated with proteins of interest, the proteins would freely diffuse in and out of the nucleus without the involvement of cells' import and export machineries. Subsequently, all the proteins, except those associated with chromatin and nuclear matrix, can be washed off. We examined the validity of this experimental system by determining the subcellular localization of importin-β (a known cytoplasmic protein) and MCM2 (a known chromatin-associating protein) (16Tsuji T. Ficarro S.B. Jiang W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4459-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 30Ishimi Y. Komamura-Kohno Y. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol.

As expected, the endogenous importin-β was effectively washed off when cells were treated with Triton X-100 prior to fixation (Fig. 2A, X100/PFA). In contrast, the endogenous MCM2 proteins were not released from the cell under the same conditions due to their association with chromatin (Fig. 2B). We also found that Orc2, a replication protein binding to chromatin, showed a similar chromatin association pattern under the same conditions (data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that this in vitro assay system is a reliable method for studying protein-chromatin/nuclear matrix association. Using this assay system, we examined the nuclear retention of wild type Cdc7, GST·Cdc7(Δ300–332), and GST·Cdc7(Δ1–146) proteins. As shown in Fig. 2C, GST·Cdc7(Δ300–332) was not detected in the nucleus, while wild-type Cdc7 and GST·Cdc7(Δ1–146) mutant proteins localized in the nucleus. This result suggests that amino acid sequence from 300–332 is required for the Cdc7-chromain association. To further confirm this result, we examined whether Cdc7(Δ300–332) protein can be washed off when cells are treated with LMB in vivo. We fo"

The noncoiled-coil N-terminal head domain contains Golgi targeting information, a cryptic nuclear localization signal, and three caspase cleavage sites. Caspase cleavage of the golgin-160 head domain generates different fragments that can translocate to the nucleus by exposing the nuclear localization signal. We have previously shown that GCP60, a Golgi resident protein, interacts weakly with the golgin-160 head domain but has a strong interaction with one of the caspase-generated golgin-160 fragments (residues 140–311). This preferential interaction increases the Golgi retention of the golgin-160 fragment in cells overexpressing GCP60. Here we studied the interaction of golgin-160-(140–311) with GCP60 and identified a single cysteine residue in GCP60 (Cys-463) that is critical for the interaction of the two proteins. Mutation of the cysteine blocked the interaction in vitro and disrupted the ability to retain the golgin-160 fragment at the Golgi in cells. We also found that Cys-463 is redox-sensitive; in its reduced form, interaction with golgin-160 was diminished or abolished, whereas oxidation of the Cys-463 by hydrogen peroxide restored the interaction. In addition, incubation with a nitric oxide donor promoted this interaction in vitro. These findings suggest that nuclear translocation of golgin-160-(140–311) is a highly coordinated event regulated not only by cleavage of the golgin-160 head but also by the oxidation state of GCP60.

Phosphorylation of some golgins is required for mitotic disassembly of the Golgi complex (reviewed in Ref. 3Short B. Haas A. Barr F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 383-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and RNA interference experiments have implicated different golgins in specific membrane traffic steps (4Diao A. Rahman D.

Expression of noncleavable forms of p115 or golgin-160 delays Golgi disassembly during apoptosis, whereas expression of a potential C-terminal caspase-cleavage product of p115, which translocates to the nucleus, induces apoptosis (10Chiu R. Novikov L. Mukherjee S. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These observations link cleavage of these Golgi proteins to apoptotic signaling as well as Golgi structure. Golgin-160 is predicted to have a noncoiled-coil “head” domain (N-terminal one-third) and a long coiled-coil (C-terminal two-thirds). Golgin-160 has been shown to promote the cell surface expression of a subset of potassium channels (12Bundis F. Neagoe I. Schwappach B. Steinmeyer K. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2006; 17: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and the β1-adrenergic receptor (13Hicks S.W. Horn T.A. McCaffery J.M. Zuckerman D.M. Machamer C.E. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Golgin-160 was also shown to be involved in targeting the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the insulin-responsive secretory vesicles in adipocytes (14Williams D. Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. Pessin J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 5346-5355Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The N-terminal head domain contains Golgi targeting information, a cryptic nuclear localization signal (NLS), 2The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; GCP60, Golgi complex-associated protein of 60 kDa; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; DEA-NONOate, diethylamine NONOate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA. 2The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; GCP60, Golgi complex-associated protein of 60 kDa; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; DEA-NONOate, diethylamine NONOate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA. and three aspartate residues that can be targeted by caspases during apoptosis (11Mancini M.

Caspase-2 has been shown to cleave golgin-160 at aspartate 59, whereas caspase-3 cleaves it at aspartate 139. In addition, aspartate 311 can be cleaved by either caspase-2, -3, or -7 (11Mancini M.

Cleavage of the golgin-160 head domain by caspases generates different fragments exposing the cryptic NLS, promoting nuclear translocation of the fragments that contain it (15Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The function of these golgin-160 fragments remains unknown, but cells expressing caspase-resistant golgin-160 were less sensitive to pro-apoptotic drugs that induce ER stress or ligate death receptors, indicating a potential role in signaling stress in the secretory pathway (16Maag R.S. Mancini M. Rosen A. Machamer C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3019-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Golgin-160 also interacts with GCP60 (Golgi complex-associated protein of 60 kDa) (17Sbodio J.I. Hicks S.W. Simon D. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27924-27931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). GCP60, initially identified as a Giantin interactor, was proposed to play a role in maintenance of the Golgi structure (18Sohda M. Misumi Y. Yamamoto A. Yano A. Nakamura N. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45298-45306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recently, GCP60 (also known as ACBD3) was also shown to be involved in regulating signaling during asymmetric cell division in neuronal progenitor cells (19Zhou Y. Atkins J.B. Rompani S.B.

The GCP60 sequence predicts a central coiled-coil domain, an acyl-CoA binding domain, and a Golgi dynamics domain, also found in other Golgi proteins and proposed to be involved in protein-protein interactions (18Sohda M.

Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (research0023)Google Scholar). Human GCP60 is 96% identical to human PAP7, a peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor and cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit RI-α interactor (21Li H. Degenhardt B. Tobin D. Yao Z.X. Tasken K. Papadopoulos V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2211-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). GCP60/PAP7 is highly expressed in steroid-producing tissues, such as testis and ovary (21Li H. Degenhardt B. Tobin D. Yao Z.X. Tasken K. Papadopoulos V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2211-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and is also expressed in all the regions of the brain examined (22Cheah J.H. Kim S.F. Hester L.D. Clancy K.W. Patterson III, S.E. Papadopoulos V. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 2006; 51: 431-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). GCP60/PAP7 localizes predominantly to the Golgi region (17Sbodio J.I. Hicks S.W. Simon D. Machamer C.E. J. Biol.

It is also present at mitochondria in steroid hormone-producing cells where it was implicated in sterol trafficking (23Liu J. Li H. Papadopoulos V. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 85: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Recently, GCP60/PAP7 was also shown to be involved in iron homeostasis (22Cheah J.H. Kim S.F. Hester L.D. Clancy K.W. Patterson III, S.E. Papadopoulos V. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 2006; 51: 431-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We identified GCP60 as a golgin-160 interacting protein using the golgin-160 head domain as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. However, GCP60 shows a preferential interaction with the caspase-generated golgin-160 fragment, 140–311, compared with the golgin-160 head domain or the 60–311 fragment (17Sbodio J.I. Hicks S.W. Simon D. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27924-27931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Golgin-160-(140–311), which could be generated by cleavage by caspase-3 alone or in combination with caspase-2 or -7, translocates to the nucleus when exogenously expressed (15Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of golgin-160-(140–311) with GCP60 reduces nuclear translocation and increases its Golgi retention, suggesting that this interaction also occurs in vivo (17Sbodio J.I. Hicks S.W. Simon D. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27924-27931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, cells overexpressing GCP60 are more sensitive to apoptosis induced by staurosporine, suggesting a possible pro-survival role of this golgin-160 fragment in the nucleus (17Sbodio J.I. Hicks S.W. Simon D. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27924-27931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here we studied the interaction of golgin-160-(140–311) with GCP60. We identified a redox-sensitive cysteine in GCP60 that regulates the interaction. Because this interaction prevents this golgin-160 fragment from translocating to the nucleus, these findings will contribute to our understanding of the function of golgin-160-(140–311) in the nucleus and the consequences of redox changes at Golgi complex membranes. Expression Constructs—The Myc-tagged golgin-160-(140–311) construct has been described previously (15Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The pEGFP-GCP60 and pEGFP-GCP60-(328–528) have been described (17Sbodio J.I. Hicks S.W. Simon D.

The pEGFP-GCP60-(328–528)C463S and pEGFP-GCP60-(328–528)C487S were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and base changes were confirmed by sequencing using the dideoxy sequencing method. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of golgin-160, 1–393, 60–311, 60–139, and 140–311, have been described previously (17Sbodio J.I. Hicks S.W. Simon D. Machamer C.E. J. Biol.

The GST-golgin-160-(1–139) and -(1–311) constructs were made by PCR amplification and cloned into the BamHI site of pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences). The GST-golgin-160-(60–393) and -(140–393) constructs were made by digestion of GST-golgin-160-(60–311) and -(140–311), respectively, with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into BamHI-EcoRI-digested pGEX-golgin-160-(1–393). Cells and Antibodies—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA) and 0.1 mg/ml normocin-O (InvivoGen, San Diego) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The anti-N-terminal golgin-160 antibody has been described previously (15Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP antibodies were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and anti-GFP mouse antibodies were from Roche Applied Science as were the monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies. The Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA), and the Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HeLa cells cultured on coverslips (70–80% confluent) were transfected with 1 μg of DNA per 35-mm dish using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as recommended by the manufacturer. At 18–20 h post-transfection, cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, rinsed in PBS containing 10 mm glycine (Gly/PBS) for 5 min, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in Gly/PBS for 3 min, and rinsed in Gly/PBS. The coverslips were then incubated in primary antibodies for 20 min, washed twice with Gly/PBS, and incubated with secondary antibodies. After washing, the cells were incubated with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) for 3 min, washed, and mounted in glycerol containing 0.1 mN-propyl gallate. The images were collected on an Axioskop microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) equipped with epifluorescence and a Sensys CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) using IP Lab software (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA). The scoring of cells for Fig. 6C has been described in detail previously (17Sbodio J.I. Hicks S.W. Simon D. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27924-27931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, a nuclear classification was assigned to those cells with exclusively nuclear staining or nuclear staining equal to or stronger than Golgi staining. Golgi classification was assigned to those cells where the Golgi staining was stronger than nuclear staining. Approximately 150 cells were counted for each transfection condition in four independent experiments. The samples were coded so that scoring was performed without knowing their identities. Binding Assays—The GST constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-codon plus (Stratagene) and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). For the binding assays, 10 μgof purified GST or GST fusion proteins were rebound to glutathione beads and incubated overnight with transfected HeLa cell lysates, obtained as follows. Cells cultured in 60-mm plates (70–80% confluent) were transfected using FuGENE 6 as described above. The cells were lysed in detergent solution (62.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.4% deoxycholate, 1.0% Nonidet P-40) and protease inhibitors (catalog number P8340, Sigma), incubated on ice for 15 min, and spun at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Lysates were incubated with the beads overnight and washed three times in detergent solution. Bound proteins were eluted in sample buffer, boiled, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblotting. Briefly, electrophoresed proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the membranes were blocked in 5% milk/TBS-T (0.1% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Blots were incubated overnight with the appropriate primary antibody at 4 °C and with secondary antibody for 60 min at room temperature. The primary antibodies were diluted in TBS-T containing 4% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% sodium azide, whereas the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used at a 1:2000 dilution in TBS-T only. Membranes were analyzed using chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and measured using x-ray films or by the VersaDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad) using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Oxidation Assay—HeLa cells transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-GCP60-(328–528) or GFP-GCP60-(328–528)C463S were lysed in detergent solution and the lysates were incubated overnight with golgin-160-(140–311) fused to GST or GST alone that had been previously rebound to glutathione beads as described above. For the wild-type GCP60 C-terminal fragment, after the overnight binding, the beads were washed three times and aliquoted into four 1.5-ml tubes. One tube was washed three more times, and bound proteins were eluted in sample buffer. The other three tubes were treated with 1 mm DTT for 30 min with rocking at 4 °C. After the DTT incubation, one tube was washed three times, and bound proteins were eluted in sample buffer. The two tubes left were incubated with 2 mm hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature with rocking and washed three times with detergent solution, and one tube received sample buffer to elute the bound proteins, whereas the other tube was treated with 1 mm DTT at 4 °C for 30 min. After the second DTT incubation, the tube was washed three times, and sample buffer was added to elute bound proteins. Eluted proteins were boiled, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblotting as described above. S-Nitrosylation Assay—HeLa cells transfected with a plasmid encoding GFP-GCP60-(328–528) were lysed in detergent solution and bound to golgin-160-(140–311) fused to GST overnight. The bound GFP-GCP60 C-terminal fragment was washed three times and eluted from GST-golgin-160 beads with detergent solution containing 1 mm DTT for 1 h. The eluate was precipitated by adding 10 volumes of–20 °C acetone for 20 min at–20 °C and rinsed once with–20 °C acetone. The pellet was resuspended in detergent solution and aliquoted into five tubes containing 10 μg of golgin-160-(140– 311) fused to GST or GST alone rebound to glutathione beads. Some samples received diethylamine (DEA)-NONOate (Sigma) to a final concentration of 10 mm or equal volume of the solvent, 10 mm NaOH, and were incubated at room temperature protected from light with rocking for 1 h. The samples were washed three times, and one of the DEA-NONOate-treated samples received 1 mm DTT, and it was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and protected from light, after which it was washed three times with detergent solution. Bound proteins were eluted in sample buffer, boiled, resolved in SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblotting as described above. GCP60 Interacts Preferentially with the Golgin-160-(140–311) Fragment in Vitro—We previously showed that the N-terminal domain of golgin-160 could be targeted by caspases-2, -3, and -7 during apoptosis, generating different fragments (Fig. 1A) (11Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that GCP60 interacts better with golgin-160-(140–311) when compared with the 60–311 fragment and the full-length head, 1–393 (17Sbodio J.I. Hicks S.W. Simon D. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27924-27931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The golgin-160-(140–311) fragment could be generated by cleavage by caspase-3 alone, cleavage by caspase-3 and -2, or cleavage by caspase-3 and -7 on the same golgin-160 molecule (17Sbodio J.I. Hicks S.W. Simon D. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27924-27931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This led to the idea that the GCP60 binding domain in golgin-160 is either masked in its full-length form and becomes exposed after cleavage or that a conformational change in golgin-160-(140–311) favors the interaction. To investigate whether other golgin-160 fragments generated by a single cleavage event would also show a preferred interaction with GCP60, we produced GST fusion proteins representing fragments cleaved once with caspase-2 at Asp-59 (residues 60–393), or at Asp-311 (residues 1–311), and fragments cleaved once with caspase-3 at Asp-139 (residues 1–139 and 139–393) (Fig. 1A). Binding assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using lysates from cells expressing GFP-GCP60-(328–528), a C-terminal fragment of GCP60 that shows the same binding preference for golgin-160-(140–311) as the full-length form (17Sbodio J.I. Hicks S.W. Simon D. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27924-27931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The results show that even though all the golgin-160 fragments that have residues 140–311 in their sequence interacted, none of them interacted as strongly as that of the fusion protein representing golgin-160-(140–311) (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that cleavage at both Asp-139 and Asp-311 on the same golgin-160 molecule is necessary to promote a robust interaction with GCP60. Dithiothreitol and Iodoacetamide Prevent GCP60-Golgin-160 Interaction—Dithiothreitol (DTT), a reducing agent often used to mimic the cytosolic environment in cell lysates, prevents disulfide bonds from forming under oxidizing conditions normally present during the processing of samples. We noticed that the golgin-160-GCP60 interaction was sensitive to strong reducing conditions. 3J. I. Sbodio and C. E. Machamer, unpublished observations. To examine if milder reducing conditions would also interfere with this interaction, we performed binding assays using different DTT concentrations. As shown in Fig. 2A, the presence of 1 or 0.5 mm DTT in the lysis buffer was enough to prevent interaction. Even when the DTT concentration was as low as 0.1 mm, the interaction was strongly diminished, as compared with binding in the absence of DTT (Fig. 2A). This interaction could also be disrupted if DTT was added after binding (Fig. 2B) or if another reducing agent, β-mercaptoethanol, was used (Fig. 2C). The data suggest that reducing agents can inhibit or reverse the interaction of golgin-160-(140–311) and GCP60. To investigate the potential role of cysteine residues in this protein-protein interaction, we treated HeLa cells transfected with a plasmid encoding GFP-GCP60-(328–528) prior to lysis with iodoacetamide, a cysteine-alkylating agent, and performed binding assays using golgin-160-(140–311) fused to GST or GST alone. Fig. 3 shows that preincubation of cells with iodoacetamide prevented the interaction of golgin-160-(140–311) and GCP60-(328–528). Together, the DTT, β-mercaptoethanol, and iodoacetamide observations implicate cysteine residues as important mediators of the GCP60-golgin-160 binding. Mutation of Cysteine 463 in GCP60 Disrupts Its Interaction with Golgin-160 in Vitro—To date, all known GCP60 interactors have been shown to bind to the C-terminal portion of the protein (Fig. 4A) (17Sbodio J.I. Hicks S.W. Simon D. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27924-27931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Sohda M. Misumi Y. Yamamoto A. Yano A. Nakamura N.

Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2211-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As shown above, treatment with DTT or iodoacetamide prevents GCP60-(328–528) interaction with golgin-160-(140–311). Golgin-160-(140–311) does not have cysteine residues in its sequence, so an intermolecular disulfide bond cannot form between these two sequences. On the other hand, GCP60-(328–528) has two cysteine residues, Cys-463 and Cys-487 (Fig. 4A). To investigate if the absence of DTT in the lysis buffer could induce formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond that promotes binding to golgin-160-(140–311), we mutated each cysteine residue individually to serine and assayed for binding in the presence or absence of DTT. Fig. 4B shows that when Cys-487 was mutated to Ser, the GCP60-(328–528) mutant bound golgin-160-(140–311) as well as wild-type GCP60, and this binding was prevented by 1 mm DTT. On the other hand, when Cys-463 was mutated to serine, the interaction was abolished regardless of the presence of DTT. These results suggest that interaction of GCP60 with golgin-160-(140–311) depends on cysteine 463 in GCP60. Mutation of Cysteine 463 in GCP60 Reduces Its Interaction with Golgin-160-(140–311) in Vivo—Caspase cleavage of golgin-160 generates distinct fragments that expose an otherwise cryptic NLS, allowing those fragments that contain the NLS to translocate to the nucleus (15Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We showed that overexpression of GCP60 increases Golgi retention of these fragments, including a fragment representing the full-length head domain of golgin-160 (17Sbodio J.I. Hicks S.W. Simon D.

This suggests that GCP60 might interact, at least weakly, with the full-length form of golgin-160 in vivo (17Sbodio J.I. Hicks S.W. Simon D. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27924-27931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Interaction with Giantin was proposed to be responsible for Golgi localization of GCP60 (18Sohda M. Misumi Y. Yamamoto A. Yano A. Nakamura N. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45298-45306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); however, golgin-160 might also play a role to its Golgi localization. Therefore, to evaluate the contribution of Cys-463 in GCP60 to golgin-160-(140–311) interaction in vivo, we first needed to determine whether golgin-160 contributes to Golgi localization of GCP60. To investigate this, we depleted golgin-160 using RNA interference. HeLa cells were transfected with small interfering RNA duplexes (siRNA) against golgin-160, using conditions previously shown to deplete golgin-160 more than 95% (13Hicks S.W. Horn T.A. McCaffery J.M. Zuckerman D.M. Machamer C.E. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After 72 h the cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding GFP-GCP60. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that when golgin-160 was knocked down to undetectable levels, GCP60 still localized to the Golgi, suggesting that interaction with golgin-160 is not required to localize GCP60 to the Golgi complex (Fig. 5). Thus, it was possible to evaluate the ef"
https://openalex.org/W2041790387,"Background Co-infection with hepatitis C in HIV-infected individuals is associated with 3- to 4-fold higher mortality among these patients' siblings, compared with siblings of mono-infected HIV-patients or population controls. This indicates that risk factors shared by family members partially account for the excess mortality of HIV/HCV-co-infected patients. We aimed to explore the causes of death contributing to the excess sibling mortality. Methodology and Principal Findings We retrieved causes of death from the Danish National Registry of Deaths and estimated cause-specific excess mortality rates (EMR) for siblings of HIV/HCV-co-infected individuals (n = 436) and siblings of HIV mono-infected individuals (n = 1837) compared with siblings of population controls (n = 281,221). Siblings of HIV/HCV-co-infected individuals had an all-cause EMR of 3.03 (95% CI, 1.56–4.50) per 1,000 person-years, compared with siblings of matched population controls. Substance abuse-related deaths contributed most to the elevated mortality among siblings [EMR = 2.25 (1.09–3.40)] followed by unnatural deaths [EMR = 0.67 (−0.05–1.39)]. No siblings of HIV/HCV co-infected patients had a liver-related diagnosis as underlying cause of death. Siblings of HIV-mono-infected individuals had an all-cause EMR of 0.60 (0.16–1.05) compared with siblings of controls. This modest excess mortality was due to deaths from an unknown cause [EMR = 0.28 (0.07–0.48)], deaths from substance abuse [EMR = 0.19 (−0.04–0.43)], and unnatural deaths [EMR = 0.18 (−0.06–0.42)]. Conclusions HCV co-infection among HIV-infected patients was a strong marker for family-related mortality due to substance abuse and other unnatural causes. To reduce morbidity and mortality in HIV/HCV-co-infected patients, the advances in antiviral treatment of HCV should be accompanied by continued focus on interventions targeted at substance abuse-related risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2034364569,"Bacterial adaptation to new environments often leads to the establishment of new genotypes with significantly altered phenotypes. In the Wrinkly Spreader (WS), ecological success in static liquid microcosms was through the rapid colonisation of the air-liquid interface by the production of a cellulose-based biofilm. Rapid surface spreading was also seen on agar plates, but in this two-dimensional environment the WS appears maladapted and rapidly reverts to the ancestral smooth (SM)-like colony genotype. In this work, the fitness of WS relative to SM in mixed colonies was found to be low, confirming the WS instability on agar plates. By examining defined WS mutants, the maladaptive characteristic was found to be the expression of cellulose. SM-like revertants had a higher growth rate than WS and no longer expressed significant amounts of cellulose, further confirming that the expression of this high-cost polymer was the basis of maladaptation and the target of compensatory mutation in developing colonies. However, examination of the fate of WS-founded populations in either multiple-colony or single mega-colony agar plate microcosms demonstrated that the loss of WS lineages could be reduced under conditions in which the rapid spreading colony phenotype could dominate nutrient and oxygen access more effectively than competing SM/SM-like genotypes. WS-like isolates recovered from such populations showed increased WS phenotype stability as well as changes in the degree of colony spreading, confirming that the WS was adapting to the two-dimensional agar plate microcosm."
https://openalex.org/W1964051538,"Among the many bacteria naturally competent for transformation by DNA uptake—a phenomenon with significant clinical and financial implications— Pasteurellaceae and Neisseriaceae species preferentially take up DNA containing specific short sequences. The genomic overrepresentation of these DNA uptake enhancing sequences (DUES) causes preferential uptake of conspecific DNA, but the function(s) behind this overrepresentation and its evolution are still a matter for discovery. Here I analyze DUES genome dynamics and evolution and test the validity of the results to other selectively constrained oligonucleotides. I use statistical methods and computer simulations to examine DUESs accumulation in Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae genomes. I analyze DUESs sequence and nucleotide frequencies, as well as those of all their mismatched forms, and prove the dependence of DUESs genomic overrepresentation on their preferential uptake by quantifying and correlating both characteristics. I then argue that mutation, uptake bias, and weak selection against DUESs in less constrained parts of the genome combined are sufficient enough to cause DUESs accumulation in susceptible parts of the genome with no need for other DUES function. The distribution of overrepresentation values across sequences with different mismatch loads compared to the DUES suggests a gradual yet not linear molecular drive of DNA sequences depending on their similarity to the DUES. Other genomically overrepresented sequences, both pro- and eukaryotic, show similar distribution of frequencies suggesting that the molecular drive reported above applies to other frequent oligonucleotides. Rare oligonucleotides, however, seem to be gradually drawn to genomic underrepresentation, thus, suggesting a molecular drag. To my knowledge this work provides the first clear evidence of the gradual evolution of selectively constrained oligonucleotides, including repeated, palindromic and protein/transcription factor-binding DNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2044322639,"The ability of adherent cells such as fibroblasts to enter the cell cycle and progress to S phase is strictly dependent on the extent to which individual cells can attach to and spread on a substratum. Here we have used microengineered adhesive islands of 22 and 45 μm diameter surrounded by a nonadhesive substratum of polyhydroxyl methacrylate to accurately control the extent to which individual Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts may spread. The effect of cell shape on mitogen-evoked Ca2+ signaling events that accompany entry into the cell cycle was investigated. In unrestricted cells, the mitogens bombesin and fetal calf serum evoked a typical biphasic change in the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration. However, when the spreading of individual cells was restricted, such that progression to S phase was substantially reduced, both bombesin and fetal calf serum caused a rapid transient rise in the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration but failed to elicit the normal sustained influx of Ca2+ that follows Ca2+ release. As expected, restricting cell spreading led to the loss of actin stress fibers and the formation of a ring of cortical actin. Restricting cell shape did not appear to influence mitogen-receptor interactions, nor did it influence the presence of focal adhesions. Because Ca2+ signaling is an essential component of mitogen responses, these findings implicate Ca2+ influx as a necessary component of cell shape-dependent control of the cell cycle.

Strict regulation of cell proliferation is necessary for controlled growth and development, tissue maintenance, and repair.

Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 719-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). However, growth factors acting alone cannot stimulate proliferation. In addition, a cell must receive the correct environmental cues. These are derived from cell-substrate adhesion (8Otsuka H. Kim M. J. Cell.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 53: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Recently, it has come to light that cell-cell contact can exert either pro- or anti-proliferative responses depending upon the activity of Rho kinase (14Nelson C.M. Kim C.S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3571-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Consequently, growth factors will not stimulate proliferation in nonadhered cells, and cell adhesion alone is insufficient to trigger proliferation. Growth factors will not stimulate adherent cells to proliferate in culture unless the cells are allowed to spread.Transient stimulation by a mitogen is not sufficient to trigger proliferation, and the presence of mitogen is required for many hours until the cells progress past the restriction point in G1 (15Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar, 16Brooks R.F. Nature. 1976; 260: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thereafter, the cell is committed to divide, even if the mitogen is withdrawn, or the cell is no longer in contact with a substrate (17Bohmer R.M. Kim E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 18Ingber D.E. Kim D. Sun Z. Betensky H. Wang N. J.

This restriction point is characterized by hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein and subsequent activation of the E2F transcription factor (20Weinberg R.A.

Activity of ERK1/2 is critical in reaching the restriction point because it regulates the expression of cyclin D1 that in turn regulates the activity of the cyclin-dependent kinases cdk4 and cdk6 (1Cook S.J. Kim K. Garner A. Millar T. Taverner C. Todd D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19Sherr C.J. Trends Biochem.

J. 1993; 289: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) are responsible for phosphorylating the retinoblastoma protein (1Cook S.J. Kim K. Garner A. Millar T. Taverner C. Todd D. Biochem.

Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar), thereby relieving its inhibition of transcription. Mitogens evoke a biphasic increase in ERK1/2 activity involving a large initial increase in activity followed by a degree of activity sustained at a lower level (2Balmanno K. Kim S.J.

Without cell adhesion and integrin engagement, the critical activity of ERK1/2 is too transient to trigger progression past the restriction point (27Welsh C.F. Kim K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 28Roovers K. Kim G. Zhu X. Bottazzi M.E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).The role of cell shape in cell cycle progression is also critical (29Huang S. Kim D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E131-E138Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Studies using adhesive islands of varying diameters that strictly control cell spreading revealed that the degree of spreading dictates the proportion of cells that proliferate (10Folkman J. Kim A. Nature. 1978; 273: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar, 11Ireland G.W. Kim P. Jordan P. O'Neill C. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1987; 8: 19-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12O'Neill C. Kim P. Ireland G. Cell. 1986; 44: 489-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). When cell spreading is severely restricted, the actin cytoskeleton is rearranged, revealing the formation of cortical actin and loss of stress fibers (30Ireland G.W. Kim P.J. Jordan P.W. O'Neill C.H. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1989; 13: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Disruption of cell shape with agents that eliminate actin stress fibers also inhibits proliferation (17Bohmer R.M. Kim E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 29Huang S. Kim D.E. Nat.

Rho-dependent tension in the stress fibers is required for the all-important, maintained activity of ERK1/2 that leads to expression of cyclin D1. Interestingly, inhibition of Rho kinase reveals an alternative, stress fiber-independent route to cyclin D1 expression. This Rho kinase-suppressed pathway is mediated by Rac1 and cdc42 (27Welsh C.F. Kim K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), but its activation still requires the presence of a mitogen as well as integrin engagement. In addition, RhoA is reported to regulate p27kip1 degradation through its effector, mDia and expression of Skp2 (32Mammoto A. Kim S. Moore K. Oh P. Ingber D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26323-26330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, activation of the Rho-mDia/Rho kinase-Skp2-p27 pathway in rounded cells does not fully mimic the shape-dependent signal for G1 progression (32Mammoto A. Kim S. Moore K. Oh P. Ingber D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26323-26330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Consequently additional signaling pathways must be involved in transducing the downstream effects of cell shape to the cell cycle machinery.Ca2+ signaling is also affected by the state of the actin cytoskeleton. Pharmacological agents that affect the cytoskeleton and hence cell shape-dependent cell cycle progression also affect Ca2+ signaling (33Patterson R.L. Kim D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 34Ribeiro C.M. Kim J. Putney J.W. Jr. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2000; 526: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Consequently Ca2+ signaling may form a link between cell shape and cell cycle progression. To investigate this possibility, we made use of adhesive palladium islands (11Ireland G.W. Kim P. Jordan P. O'Neill C. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1987; 8: 19-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to control the extent of cell spreading. Using Swiss 3T3 cells synchronized in G0, we investigated the effects of cell shape on the bombesin- and FCS-evoked Ca2+ responses and on the ability of the cells to progress through G1. We also examined how cell shape affected the cytoskeleton and the presence of focal adhesions. Our key finding was that restricting cell shape dramatically affects the profile of the bombesin- and FCS-evoked [Ca2+]c responses. Ca2+ release appears to be unaffected, but Ca2+ influx is abolished. The ramifications for cell cycle progression are discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were a kind gift from Prof. E. Rozengurt (Imperial Cancer Research Fund Laboratories, London, UK). Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), fetal calf serum (FCS), and 0.05% trypsin in 0.02% EDTA were purchased from Invitrogen. Penicillin, streptomycin, bombesin, bovine serum albumin, lubrol, polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate (polyHEMA), and primary antibodies raised to α-actinin and talin were supplied by Sigma. Triton X-100, paraformaldehyde, ammonium chloride, glucose, sodium citrate, sodium bicarbonate, and HEPES were obtained from VWR International Ltd. (Leicestershire, UK). Anti-mouse immunoglobulin FITC conjugates were purchased from Dako Ltd. (Ely, UK). VectaShield was supplied by Vecta Laboratories Ltd. (Peterborough, UK). Fura-2 AM was purchased from Molecular Probes (via Cambridge Bioscience Ltd., Cambridge, UK). Propidium iodide and ionomycin were obtained from Calbiochem (Nottingham, UK).Cell Culture—Swiss 3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 44 mm sodium bicarbonate, 25 mm glucose, penicillin-G (35 units/ml), and streptomycin (80 milliunits/ml). The cells were incubated at 37 °C at pH 7.4 in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2 and 90% air. Swiss 3T3 cells were subcultured at ∼70% confluence three times/week. The cells were incubated with 0.05% trypsin in 0.02% EDTA for 4 min at 37 °C. The cells were then added to 10 ml of 10% FCS-DMEM and centrifuged at 140 × g for 5 min and split at a ratio of 1:4 in 10% FCS-DMEM.Preparation of Adhesive Palladium Islands—Clean glass coverslips were coated with polyHEMA (37Minett T.W. Kim B.J. Lydon M.J. Rees D.A. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1984; 8: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 1% (w/v) solution of polyHEMA in 95% ethanol was prepared and was evenly coated on the coverslips. The polyHEMA-coated coverslips were air-dried at room temperature for 90 min and then at 60 °C for a further 90 min. Palladium was then deposited onto the surface of the polyHEMA using an Edwards 12E6 vacuum coating unit. The palladium was evaporated through photo-lithographically etched copper foils containing perforations of either 45 or 22 diameter μm to form large or small islands set 200 μm apart (11Ireland G.W. Kim P. Jordan P. O'Neill C. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1987; 8: 19-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to use in experiments, the coverslips were sterilized by UV irradiation for 20 min and were then stored in a desiccator cabinet until required.Maintenance of Fibroblasts on Palladium Islands—Confluent and quiescent monolayers of cells 5 days old were washed with 10 ml of versene (136.8 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 6.21 mm Na2HPO4, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, 0.54 mm EDTA). The cells were incubated with 0.05% trypsin in 0.02% EDTA for 4 min at 37 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10% FCS-DMEM, and 2-ml aliquots containing cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells/ml for large islands and 8 × 104 cells/ml for small islands, resulting in single cell occupancy of islands (38Promwikorn W. Kim S.R. Pennington S.R. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere for 1 h and were washed three times with 1 ml of 10% FCS-DMEM to remove remaining unattached cells. These coverslips were transferred to a fresh dish and incubated for a further 2 h in 2 ml of 10% FCS-DMEM to enable attachment and spreading. The coverslips were subsequently washed three times with 1 ml of serum-free DMEM and were then incubated in 2 ml of serum-free DMEM for 16 h, so that the cells entered quiescence.Visualization of Actin Cytoskeleton—The cells were washed in PBS (136.8 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 6.21 mm Na2HPO4, 1.47 mm KH2PO4) and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min and then rinsed in cell lysis buffer (10 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 m glycerol) for 30 min. The cells were permeabilized in cell lysis buffer containing 5 mg/ml, bovine serum albumin, and 1% lubrol (w/v) for 30 min and subsequently incubated in FITC phalloidin (2.5 μg/ml) for 60 min at room temperature in the dark. They were rinsed three times with cell lysis buffer to remove excess phalloidin as previously described (39McNamee C.J. Kim S.R. Sheterline P. Cell Biol. Int. 1995; 19: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).Focal Adhesion Staining—The cells were washed in PBS for 10 min and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. Excess paraformaldehyde was then quenched in ammonium chloride (50 mm) for 10 min before permeabilization in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 10 min before washing with PBS for 10 min. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies (3 μl/ml) raised to α-actinin or talin for 5 h. The cells were then washed five times with PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies, 3 μl/ml anti-mouse IgG FITC-conjugated antibody overnight at 4 °C. Finally, coverslips were washed five times in PBS for 10 min to remove unbound antibodies (40Burrell H.E. Kim B. Foster B.J. Buckley K.A. Sharpe G.R. Quayle J.M. Simpson A.W. Gallagher J.A. J. Biol.

Quiescent cells were maintained on adhesive islands or unrestricted on glass coverslips as described above and were incubated either in serum-free DMEM or in DMEM-10% FCS for 24 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, and subsequently incubated in 0.03% Triton X-100 in 4 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.6, containing 0.2 μg/ml RNase and 10 μg/ml propidium iodide for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were recovered by gentle pipetting and were analyzed by flow cytometry using a 15-milliwatt FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) with a 488-nm line from an air-cooled argon ion laser. Data analysis was performed using the WinMDI (version 2.8) software package. In each island study, the data were collected from at least three separate experiments involving at least five individual samples of 2,000 cells.Measurement of Intracellular Calcium—The intracellular calcium concentration was measured by monitoring the fluorescence emission of cells loaded with Fura-2 AM (43Conant A.R. Kim M.J. McLennan A.G. Simpson A.W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The cells were immersed in HEPES-buffered saline (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm MgSO4) with either 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA. After 16 h in serum-free conditions, the cells were loaded with 2 μm Fura-2 AM at 37 °C for 45 min in HEPES-buffered saline also containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.0125% pluronic F127, and 200 μm sulfinpyrazone. After loading, the coverslips were placed in a purpose built thermostatted chamber. Changes in fluorescence were monitored with a PTI Deltascan imaging system coupled to a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope and Photon Science Ltd.

The cells in the bottom panels (glass/palladium) have the typical spread morphology of fibroblasts in culture. The middle panels show the appearance of cells plated on microarrays of 45-μm diameter islands (five of the nine islands are occupied in the middle left panel). The top panels reveal the appearance of cells on the small, 22-μm diameter adhesive islands. The degree of spreading is clearly restricted, and these cells have a dome-like morphology (11Ireland G.W. Kim P. Jordan P. O'Neill C. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1987; 8: 19-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12O'Neill C. Kim P. Ireland G. Cell. 1986; 44: 489-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The main difference between unrestricted cells and those on large islands is that the unrestricted cells adopt a range of polygonal type shapes, whereas on the large islands the cells are uniformly circular when viewed from the top down. Importantly, the overall degree of spreading between these two conditions is quite similar, especially when they are compared with the cells on the small islands. Membrane ruffling is a feature of unrestricted cells, and a small degree of ruffling can also be observed with the cells on the large islands but not with the cells on the small islands.Restriction of Cell Spreading Prevents S Phase Progression—DNA content was measured by flow cytometry and propidium iodide staining following mitogen stimulation with 10% FCS. The bottom right panel of Fig. 2 shows the effects of adding serum to cells on a nonrestrictive surface. The bottom left panel shows the serum-free control. Typically, 70% of these cells progressed to G2/M after 24 h when stimulated with FCS as demonstrated by the increase in the peak reporting 2× DNA content. Again, ∼70% of the cells on large islands also progressed to G2/M when stimulated with 10% FCS, whereas only ∼25% of cells on small islands progressed to G2/M, with the most of the cells arrested in G0/G1. These data are in close agreement with the landmark experiments conducted by Folkman (10Folkman J. Kim A. Nature. 1978; 273: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar) and Ireland and co-workers (11Ireland G.W. Kim P. Jordan P. O'Neill C. J. Cell Sci.

DNA content of Swiss 3T3 cells was measured by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Confluent-quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were plated onto either small or large adhesive islands or nonrestrictive glass coverslips and maintained in DMEM for 16 h in the absence of FCS. The cells were then incubated in the presence or absence of 10% FCS for a further 24 h. Peaks correspond to either normal DNA content (n) or twice normal DNA content (2n).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Manipulation of Cell Shape Alters Ca2+ Signaling—Because elevations of [Ca2+]c are known to be essential for G1 progression and cell proliferation, as well as being an integral part of mitogen signaling, we examined the effects of plating cells on restrictive islands on mitogen-evoked [Ca2+]c responses. In control experiments, with cells plated on glass or palladium, a typical biphasic elevation of [Ca2+]c ([Ca2+]c peak followed by elevated plateau) was observed when the cells were treated with either 10 nm bombesin (Fig. 3a) or 10% FCS (Table 1). When extracellular Ca2+ was removed, both bombesin and FCS evoked a transient elevation of [Ca2+]c that rapidly returned to baseline and was not followed by a plateau of elevated [Ca2+]c. (Fig. 3e and Table 1). These findings are consistent with Ca2+ influx being required for the plateau phase of the Ca2+ response. When the cells were placed on the large adhesive islands, mitogen stimulation resulted in [Ca2+]c responses that were similar to those observed in cells on the nonrestrictive surfaces (Fig. 3, compare c with a and 3b and Table 1). In marked contrast, however, when the cells were plated on the small adhesive islands, the mitogen response consisted only of the initial transient spike in [Ca2+]c, and no sustained element of elevated plateau occurred (Fig. 3d and Table 1). These data indicate that mitogens evoke a release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores but not an influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular environment when Swiss 3T3 cells are plated on a restrictive surface that prevents cell spreading. The responses are essentially the same as those seen in the presence of the Ca2+ chelator, EGTA (Fig. 3). These data are summarized in Table 1.FIGURE 3Restriction of cell spreading alters bombesin-induced Ca2+ signaling. Quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were stimulated with 10 nm bombesin in the presence of either 1 mm extracellular Ca2+ (a–d) or 1 mm EGTA (e).

https://openalex.org/W2030421748,"We have characterized, by transient-state kinetic methods, the polymerase and exonuclease activities of the human mitochondrial DNA polymerase (pol γ) during reverse transcription, employing a synthetic oligonucleotide consisting of a DNA primer and an RNA template. In comparison with the kinetic parameters observed with a DNA template, the rate of correct deoxynucleotide incorporation was reduced 25-fold (5.5 ± 0.2 s–1), whereas the dissociation constant (Kd) for nucleotide binding was increased 4-fold (12 ± 1 μm). In addition, discrimination against mismatches was reduced ∼20-fold to only 15,000 on average. The proofreading exonuclease favored the removal of an incorrect nucleotide (0.0021 ± 0.0002 s–1 for correct versus 0.034 ± 0.004 s–1 for incorrect), and the partitioning between incorporation beyond a mismatch (5.5 × 10 –5 ± 0.4 × 10 –5 s–1), and exonuclease removal of that mismatch favors removal of the mismatch. These data suggest that the “reverse transcriptase activity” of mitochondrial polymerase could be physiologically relevant. However, the enzyme stalls and is unable to efficiently incorporate beyond a single nucleotide with an RNA template. Additionally, we present a refined method for calculating net discrimination, which more accurately describes the contributions of correct and incorrect incorporation.

Reverse transcription is the process of DNA polymerization using an RNA template, and it is interesting to note that mitochondrial DNA polymerases (pol γ) were initially characterized by their ability to reverse-transcribe DNA from RNA (1Ito K. Kim M. Green M. J. Virol. 1975; 15: 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, over the past 30 years, human pol 2The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; RT, reverse transcriptase.2The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; RT, reverse transcriptase. γ has been shown to be an effective reverse transcriptase in steady state single nucleotide incorporation assays using DNA/RNA heteroduplexes to probe for its presence and to assay its replication fidelity (1Ito K.

RNase digestion of mammalian mitochondrial DNA has shown that there are at least 30 ribonucleotides incorporated in the mitochondrial genome (5Yang M.Y. Kim M. Reyes A. Vergani L. Angeli P. Gringeri E. Jacobs H.T. Holt I.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), but the origin and significance of these ribonucleotides are unknown. They could be the products of incorporation by the DNA polymerase or merely remnants of RNA priming by the mitochondrial RNA polymerase after lagging strand synthesis and incomplete primer removal. Steady state assays have been used to characterize reverse transcriptase activity and fidelity of pol γ largely because steady state rates are faster with an RNA template. However, steady state, single nucleotide turnover rates are limited by polymerase dissociation from product complexes and do not provide reliable measures of nucleotide discrimination. Therefore, presteady state kinetic approaches have been used to begin to characterize more accurately the reverse transcriptase activity of human pol γ (6Murakami E. Kim J.Y. Lee H. Hanes J. Johnson K.A. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36403-36409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In our previous studies we were surprised to see how rapidly pol γ catalyzed a single DNA incorporation with an RNA template. Here we demonstrate a marked reduction in fidelity during reverse transcription and show that the polymerase stalls after a single incorporation event. Expression and Purification of Enzyme Subunits—Expression and purification of the catalytic subunit (pol γA) and the accessory subunit (pol γB) were accomplished as described previously (7Johnson A.A. Kim Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 8Graves S.W. Kim A.A. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6050-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). An exonuclease-deficient mutant of the catalytic subunit (E200A), pol γA exo–, was purified as described (9Johnson A.A. Kim K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar); this mutation reduced the exonuclease rate greater than 107-fold without affecting the kinetic parameters governing polymerization. Experiments to assess the polymerization fidelity were performed as described (9Johnson A.A. Kim K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) using the reconstituted holoenzyme, consisting of a catalytic subunit containing a C-terminal His6 tag and a 56-amino acid N-terminal truncation combined with an accessory subunit with 29-amino acid N-terminal truncation. These N-terminal truncations were designed to mimic the native protein formed by cleavage of the N-terminal mitochondrial leader sequence. Protein concentrations were determined by A280 measurements, and active enzyme concentrations were determined by active site titration against a known concentration of duplex DNA (7Johnson A.A. Kim Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A 1:5 ratio of catalytic subunit to accessory subunit was used for holoenzyme reconstitution based upon a measured Kd of 35 nm (7Johnson A.A. Kim Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and a catalytic subunit concentration of 50–100 nm. Contrary to observations based upon steady state rate measurements (10Lim S.E. Kim M.J. Copeland W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38197-38203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we do not see inhibition caused by excess accessory subunit. Preparation of Synthetic Oligonucleotide Substrate—Primer strands were 5′-32P-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Termination of the reaction was accomplished by heating to 95 °C for 5 min. Excess 32P-labeled nucleotide was removed using a Biospin 6 column (Bio-Rad). Primer-template annealing was accomplished by mixing equimolar concentrations of 25-mer primer and 45-mer template, heating the mixture to 95 °C, and allowing it to cool slowly to room temperature. The sequences of primer-template substrates used are listed in Table 1.TABLE 1DNA/RNA heteroduplexes employed for reverse transcriptase studies5′-TCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCA3′-AGGAGCGUCGGCAGGUUGGUUGAGUUGGAGCUAGGUUACGGCAGG5′-TCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCA3′-AGGAGCGUCGGCAGGUUGGUUGAGUAGGAGCUAGGUUACGGCAGG5′-TCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCA3′-AGGAGCGUCGGCAGGUUGGUUGAGUCGGAGCUAGGUUACGGCAGG5′-TCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCA3′-AGGAGCGUCGGCAGGUUGGUUGAGUGACAGCTAGGUUACGGCAGG5′-TCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCAG3′-AGGAGCGUCGGCAGGUUGGUUGAGUUGGAGCUAGGUUACGGCAGG Open table in a new tab Assay Conditions—Single nucleotide incorporation assays were performed at 37 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 25 mm MgCl2. The holoenzyme-DNA complex was assembled in buffer lacking MgCl2, then mixed with a solution containing nucleotide and MgCl2. Mixing of the enzyme-DNA complex with the nucleotide was performed at a 1:1 ratio, and each solution was assembled at twice the reported final concentration. For reaction times less than 10 s, mixing was accomplished using a KinTek RQF-3 rapid quench flow instrument (Austin, TX). Longer reaction times were achieved by manual mixing. Exonuclease assays were set up as described for the polymerization assays, except that the wild-type catalytic subunit was used, and deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTP) were omitted. Both the exonuclease-deficient mutant and the wild-type catalytic subunit were used in processive polymerization experiments, performed under conditions described for the single nucleotide incorporation assays, except that all four dNTPs were included at a final concentration of 100 μm each. Product Analysis—Products were resolved on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gels, imaged using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager, and quantified using the manufacturers ImageQuaNT software (GE Healthcare). Kd and Maximum Rate of Polymerization for Incorrect Nucleotide Incorporation—Single nucleotide incorporation experiments were performed to measure the nucleotide concentration dependence of the rate of polymerization. These assays were carried out under single turnover conditions, with enzyme in slight excess over DNA, because the rates of incorporation for incorrect nucleotides were slower than the rate of dissociation of the enzyme from the DNA substrate. This protocol enables measurement of the rate of incorporation by eliminating the contributions because of turnovers of the enzyme with DNA in excess. The time course of product formation was fit to a single exponential ([product] = Ae–kt + C). Throughout the text, we will refer to the exponent derived by fitting to this equation as the observed “rate” of the reaction and reserve the term “rate constant” to refer to an intrinsic constant governing a single molecular step in a model. Rates of polymerization determined from the single exponential fit to the primary date were then plotted against nucleotide concentration and fitted to a hyperbola (observed rate = kpol[dNTP]/(Kd + [dNTP])) to determine the apparent dissociation constant, Kd, and the maximum rate of polymerization, kpol, for each incorrect nucleotide. Incorporation of Nucleotides into a 25d/45r Substrate—The kinetics of incorporation and exonuclease excision were examined in single turnover experiments and interpreted according to the model shown in Fig. 1. The concentration dependence of the presteady state burst of product formation defines Kd, dNTP, and kpol, and the ratio kpol/Kd defines the specificity constant for incorporation (11Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Correct incorporation of all four nucleotides was characterized to determine the specificity constant for incorporation of deoxyribonucleotides during reverse transcription. Representative data from this study are presented in Fig. 2. The concentration dependence of the observed rate provides an estimate of the maximum rate of 39 ± 2s–1 and an apparent dissociation constant of 18 ± 4 μm. The specificity constant for incorporation of dCTP during reverse transcription is 2.2 μm–1 s–1. Results of the single nucleotide incorporation assays for each of the four nucleotides are summarized in Table 2. The specificity constant varied from 0.5 to 2.2 μm–1 s–1 and had an average value ∼40-fold lower than that measured with a DNA template (9Johnson A.A. Kim K.A. J. Biol.

Discrimination ranged from 5,000 to 25,000 giving an average value 25-fold lower than observed with a DNA template (9Johnson A.A. Kim K.A. J. Biol.

Exonuclease Removal of Nucleotides from 25d/45r—To calculate the contribution to net fidelity afforded by the exonuclease activity when pol γ is employed as a reverse transcriptase, we measured the rates of excision of the 3′-terminal base from primers containing either correct (dA-rU) or mismatched (dG-rU) base pairs. Removal of a mismatch from a 25d/45d substrate follows a double exponential, and the rate of the fast phase defines the rate of excision, and the rate of the slow phase appears to be limited by the rate of transfer of the primer strand from the polymerase to the exonuclease active site (13Johnson A.A. Kim K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38097-38107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3H. R. Lee and K. A. Johnson, submitted for publication. In this study, we only measured a single phase, which was quite slow for both the correctly paired and mismatched primers. The results from these assays are summarized in Table 3. The terminal base was removed from a correct base pair at a rate of 0.0021 s–1, whereas a mismatch was removed at a 16-fold greater rate, 0.034 s–1. However, this rate is ∼100-fold slower than the rate of removal of a mismatch from a DNA duplex (13Johnson A.A. Kim K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38097-38107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).TABLE 3Exonuclease removal by polymerase γTemplate basedNMPRates-1rUdA0.0021 ± 0.0002dG0.034 ± 0.004 Open table in a new tab Incorporation of the Next Correct Nucleotide after a Mismatch—To fully assess the contribution to fidelity afforded by the exonuclease domain of pol γ, when employed as a reverse transcriptase, it was necessary to determine the kinetic parameters governing the forward polymerization to bury a mismatch to assess the probability of extension versus excision (16Donlin M.J. Kim S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The incorporation of a dCTP opposite a template G to bury a terminal dG-rU mispair was characterized at 100, 250, and 500 μm dCTP. The time dependence of product formation is presented in Fig. 4A, and the concentration dependence of the observed rate is depicted in Fig. 4B. To generate a fit to the data, the end point of product formation was constrained in each of the three time courses to 90 nm, the concentration of oligonucleotide duplex present in the reaction. The rates and amplitudes of the product formation observed are very low, and therefore the errors of the rate determinations are large, but it is clear that the rate of burying a mismatch is extremely low. From these experiments, the kpol for burying a mismatch was calculated to be 5.5 ± 0.4 × 10–5 s–1, and the apparent dissociation constant was 150 ± 30 μm. At a physiological nucleotide concentration (100 μm), the rate of correct incorporation on top of a mismatch is only 0.00002 s–1. This rate implies a high selectivity toward mismatch removal even though the rate of excision is low. The exonuclease would contribute a factor of 1,700 toward the overall fidelity. However, the slow extension makes this conclusion irrelevant physiologically and raises the question of the rate of extension beyond a correct base pair during reverse transcription. Processive Reverse Transcription—In order for pol γ to function as a competent reverse transcriptase, it must incorporate multiple dNTPs sequentially. To test the processivity of pol γ when acting as a reverse transcriptase, a series of experiments was designed to assay for multiple incorporation reactions. The wild-type enzyme-DNA complex was rapidly mixed with a solution containing 100 μm of each of the four dNTPs. Samples were removed at various times, and the products of reaction were resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The autoradiogram in Fig. 5 shows that the polymerase stalls after a single nucleotide incorporation event and that the rate of the exonuclease reaction is comparable with the rate of subsequent polymerization steps. Therefore, products of both reactions accumulate during the time course of the experiment. Because these experiments generated many products from a single assay, we quantified net product formation as follows. At each time point, all products longer than the 25-mer primer were summed and treated as the total product of forward polymerization. All products shorter than the 25-mer primer substrate were summed and treated as the total product of exonuclease removal. To a first approximation, these measurements define the kinetics of the first step in each direction (polymerase or exonuclease). Fig. 6 shows the time dependence of the accumulation of products of the polymerase and exonuclease reactions. Both plots fit best to a double exponential equation, and the values obtained from fitting the date are presented in Table 4. Formation of polymerase products essentially stalls after the incorporation of the first nucleotide during reverse transcription, and only minor amounts of longer products can be seen. Although the fast phase is not resolved in the experiment, the data show that it occurs at a rate of at least 6 s–1. In contrast, the exonuclease products accumulate at a rate of 0.004 s–1. The gradual decrease in exonuclease products at long reaction times may be due to errors in summing over all products. As a first approximation, these data define the kinetic partitioning between polymerization and excision reactions governing depletion of the starting material. Note also that the polymerization reaction failed to go to completion in the fast phase, which we believe is because of weak binding of the polymerase to the DNA/RNA heteroduplex.TABLE 4Fitted parameters from processive reverse transcription assayActivityFast rateFast amplitudeSlow rateSlow amplitudes-1nms-1nmPolymerase6150.002617Exonuclease0.0036650.001529 Open table in a new tab The exonuclease reaction interfered with a more complete analysis of processive polymerization because it appeared that this activity may prevent the accumulation of longer products after the first incorporation event, because the rates of the second extension and excision reactions were comparable. Therefore, the processive polymerization experiments were repeated with an exonuclease-deficient enzyme. An autoradiogram for this experiment is shown in Fig. 7A, and the time dependence of product formation is plotted in Fig. 7B. All products longer than the substrate at each time point were summed, plotted as a function of time of the reaction, and fit to a single exponential equation. This fit generated a rate of product formation of 13 ± 1s–1 and an amplitude of 56 ± 2 μm. The exonuclease-deficient enzyme proved to be no better than the wild-type enzyme in carrying out processive reverse transcription. To test the possibility that sequence context effects were preventing the polymerase from continuing past a single incorporation event, we examined whether the heteroduplex primer-template could be extended by a true reverse transcriptase, namely HIV reverse transcriptase. To get the results shown in Fig. 8, wild-type pol γ holoenzyme (100 nm) was mixed in excess over the heteroduplex (90 nm) and allowed to react with 100 μm of each nucleotide for 10 or 20 s. After 20 s of reaction, HIV RT was added to the mixture. Additional time points were collected after 30, 60, and 90 s of reaction with RT. These results show that HIV RT can continue the processive synthesis after pol γ has stalled following the first incorporation. Single Nucleotide Incorporation Assays—Single nucleotide incorporation assays were performed to determine the specificity constant for incorporation of dNTPs by pol γ onto a 25d/45r oligonucleotide DNA/RNA heteroduplex. In line with previous models for DNA polymerization, the concentration dependence of the rate single nucleotide incorporation (Fig. 2B) defined the apparent nucleotide dissociation constant, Kd, and the maximum rate of polymerization, kpol (9Johnson A.A. Kim K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 17Wong I. Kim S.S. Johnson K.A.

Kim K.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14064-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The rate of the slow phase (Fig. 2A) is most probably a function of the release of the oligonucleotide duplex from the polymerase and subsequent rebinding of the enzyme to the substrate from solution. This weakened binding of the enzyme to the oligonucleotide duplex explains the low amplitudes of single nucleotide incorporation observed in these reactions. The specificity constants for correct nucleotide incorporation ranged from a high of 2.2 μm–1 s–1 to a low of 0.5 μm –1 s–1 as detailed in Table 2. These values for RNA-dependent DNA polymerization are roughly 25–100-fold lower than the specificity constant observed for DNA-dependent DNA replication under single turnover conditions (12Lee H.R. Kim K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36236-36240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This loss of efficiency is most likely because of differences in specific contacts between the oligonucleotide duplex and the enzyme. DNA/RNA heteroduplexes have been previously shown to differ in structure from either DNA/DNA or RNA/RNA structures (20Gyi J.I. Kim A.N. Conn G.L. Brown T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The RNA strand of the heteroduplex tends toward an A-form conformation, whereas the DNA strand tends toward a B-form conformation. Overall, the duplex tends to be more A-form than B-form, which leads to a fatter duplex and a narrower and deeper major groove. This difference in structure may account for the lower rates and lower fidelity seen when pol γ copies an RNA template. To assess the possible physiological significance of the reverse transcriptase activity of pol γ, we quantified the discrimination in single turnover assays designed to determine the specificity of incorporation opposite a template rU. From these values and the specificity constants calculated for the correct incorporation of dATP opposite rU, the discrimination against misincorporation was calculated as shown in Table 2. Although the discrimination against a dG-rU (25,000) is higher than the corresponding discrimination against a dG-dT (3600), the average discrimination against misincorporation during reverse transcription is only 15,600, compared with 440,000 for DNA polymerization (12Lee H.R. Kim K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36236-36240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). With a DNA template, the least accurate replication was seen with the dG-dT wobble base (9Johnson A.A. Kim K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In contrast, when RNA was the template, the lowest fidelity was seen with the dT-rU mispair. pol γ is 50-fold more likely to make a dT-rU pair as a reverse transcriptase than it is to make a dT-dT mispair when replicating DNA, and greater than 30-fold more likely to make a dC-rU mispair than a dC-dT pair. Although we have not yet performed a comprehensive screen of all possible mismatches, our existing data suggest that pol γ can be expected to exhibit a vastly different mutation profile when operating as a reverse transcriptase compared with reactions with a DNA template (12Lee H.R. Kim K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36236-36240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Moreover, the overall fidelity is reduced 25-fold. Reverse transcriptase assays have often been employed for steady state kinetic measurements of discrimination by pol γ, in part because the rates of steady state single nucleotide incorporation assays are faster than with DNA (21Longley M.J. Kim D. Kunkel T.A. Copeland W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38555-38562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The steady state rates are limited by the rate of release of DNA from the enzyme and RNA templates provide a faster steady state rate, because they are poorer substrates. The limitations of steady state methods in determining specificity and discrimination constants have been discussed previously and will not be repeated here (12Lee H.R. Kim K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36236-36240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 22Tsai Y.C. Kim K.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9675-9687Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Our current data further call into question the validity of steady state reverse transcriptase assays to assess polymerase fidelity or discrimination against nucleoside analogs (21Longley M.J. Kim D. Kunkel T.A. Copeland W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38555-38562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 24Lim S.E. Kim W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23616-23623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Net Discrimination—Average discrimination is a parameter typically used for comparing polymerases and is one that we have used here to compare the reverse transcriptase activity of pol γ to the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of pol γ. Discrimination is defined as the number of correct nucleotides incorporated per misincorporation event and is approximately equal to the reciprocal of the misincorporation frequency, more precisely the frequency, f = 1/(D + 1), where D is the discrimination. Traditionally the “average discrimination” has been calculated by averaging the individual discrimination values, which is perfectly appropriate as defined, but perhaps a better method should be used to estimate net discrimination during DNA replication, representing the sum of all misincorporation probabilities at each position. For each templating base, there are three possible mismatched bases and only one correct base. Therefore, the frequency of making a mismatch at a given position is the sum of the individual misincorporation frequencies. Accordingly, the net discrimination, Dnet is defined by Equation 1, Dnet=1∑1/(D+1) (Eq. 1) The data in Table 2 show discrimination values ranging from 5,000 to 25,000 giving an average value of 15,600. However, the net discrimination, calculated from the sum of the frequencies of forming each mismatch, is only 3,300. This value more accurately reflects the frequency of forming the sum of all possible mismatches opposite rU, but it is obviously dominated by high frequency of forming a dTTP:rU mismatch. The average discrimination for incorporation opposite dT during DNA-dependent DNA synthesis was 275,000, but the net discrimination, as defined here, was only 3,500 because of the fast incorporation of the dGTP:dT wobble mismatch (12Lee H.R. Kim K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36236-36240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the corresponding dGTP:rU mismatch showed the largest discrimination with an RNA template (Table 2). The calculation of net discrimination could be generalized by summing error frequencies over all templating bases weighted by base composition of the genome to get the net misincorporation frequency during DNA replication. When this calculation is applied to the replication of the human mitochondrial genome, based upon measured discrimination for each mismatch (12Lee H.R. Kim K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36236-36240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the net discrimination is only 12,000 when copying the L-strand and 10,000 when copying the H-strand of human mitochondrial DNA (25Anderson S. Kim A.T. Barrell B.G. de Bruijn M.H. Coulson A.R. Drouin J. Eperon I.C. Nierlich D.P. Roe B.A. Sanger F. Schreier P.H. Smith A.J. Staden R. Young I.G. Nature. 1981; 290: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (7573) Google Scholar). These values are dominated by the high frequency of forming a dGTP:dT mismatch which, if eliminated, affords values of 73,000 and 63,000 for L- and H-strand replication, respectively. These “net discrimination” values are lower than observed from in vivo DNA replication experiments, consistent with the 200-fold improvement in fidelity because of the proofreading exonuclease (13Johnson A.A. Kim K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38097-38107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells expressing an exonuclease-deficient pol γ (D198A) mutant introduced errors at a rate of 1 in 1700 after 3 months in culture (26Spelbrink J.N. Kim J.M. Hakkaart G.A. Kurkela J.M. Cooper H.M. Lehtinen S.K. Lecrenier N. Back J.W. Speijer D. Foury F. Jacobs H.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24818-24828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Exonuclease Removal of Nucleotides from a 25d/45r—To test the activity and specificity of the exonuclease domain of pol γ, single turnover assays were performed to determine the rate of removal of a correctly paired and an incorrectly paired nucleotide. The results of these experiments are detailed in Table 3. The rate of removal of a correctly paired nucleotide was determined to be 16-fold less than the removal of a mismatch, showing that the exonuclease domain is both active against a 25d-45r oligonucleotide duplex and specific for mismatched nucleotides. To determine the contribution to fidelity afforded by the exonuclease domain, the rate of incorporation to bury a mismatch was measured. In Fig. 9 we summarize the kinetics of misincorporation and the subsequent kinetic partitioning governing extension versus excision of the mismatch. The maximum rate of incorporation to bury a mismatch was calculated to be 5.5 ± 0.4 × 10–5 s–1 and the apparent nucleotide dissociation constant was estimated to be 150 ± 30 μm. In contrast, the mismatch was excised at a rate of 0.034 s–1. Accordingly, the contribution to fidelity by the proofreading exonuclease is defined by the rate of mismatch excision relative to the rate of polymerization to bury the mismatch (13Johnson A.A. Kim K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38097-38107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) calculated as kexo/ (kexo + kbury). These data show that greater than 99.9% of mismatches will be removed by the exonuclease proofreading activity before they are buried by forward polymerization. The proofreading activity of pol γ contributes a factor of 1700-fold to the fidelity of the polymerase. In comparison, the exonuclease only contributes a 200-fold enhancement to the fidelity of the polymerase when replicating a DNA/DNA oligonucleotide substrate (13Johnson A.A. Kim K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38097-38107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the apparently higher exonuclease contribution to fidelity during reverse transcription is due solely to the significant reduction in the rate of forward polymerization. Although pol γ can incorporate a dNTP over a mismatch during DNA replication at a rate as fast as 12 s–1, it incorporates a dNTP to bury a mismatch in a 25d/45r 200,000-fold slower because rates of the second incorporation are inherently slow. Although the selective removal of mismatches and stalling of the polymerase after a mismatch would improve fidelity, the extension reaction is so slow that it would be a rare event inside the mitochondria with either a correct or mismatched primer. The cost of proofreading can also be computed by comparing the rates of excision versus extension on top of a correct base pair. Even though the rate of excision of a correct base pair is low, the rate of extension is also low, so the cost is quite high. Although we have not accurately measured the rate of extension after the first incorporation with an RNA template, it appears that most of correctly incorporated nucleotides would be removed faster than they are extended. Processive Reverse Transcription—Our results show that pol γ binds weakly to a DNA/RNA duplex, incorporates a single dNTP, and then stalls. Active site titrations attempting to determine the binding affinity of the polymerase and the oligonucleotide duplex proved to be difficult because of the low amplitude of the burst phase of product formation during presteady state RNA-dependent DNA polymerization assays; so an accurate measure of the binding affinity of pol γ to a DNA/RNA heteroduplex was not possible. However, this weak binding, as determined by pulse-chase experiments, explains the low burst amplitude observed under single turnover, single nucleotide incorporation assays and the apparent double exponential nature of these reactions. Even though the enzyme is in molar excess over the 25d/45r heteroduplex, only a small fraction of the primer-template is bound by the enzyme at the beginning of the reaction, leading to low burst amplitude and a slow second phase of the reaction because of multiple enzyme turnovers. Reverse transcriptases have been used extensively to construct cDNA libraries from cellular mRNA, and in this capacity they are extremely powerful tools for the molecular biologist. Currently available reverse transcriptases could be improved considerably, however, if these enzymes were more processive and showed proofreading activity. However, we believe that pol γ cannot be employed as a viable reverse transcriptase for molecular biological applications, because of its lack of processivity. Mutagenesis to increase the binding of the polymerase to the DNA/RNA duplex may allow for pol γ to function as a processive reverse transcriptase, but this may not be biochemically feasible or economically viable. The overall discrimination seems to be great enough that pol γ could be employed as a passable reverse transcriptase, if the exonuclease proofreading activity selectively removed mismatches. However, our measurements show that the exonuclease rates are ∼100-fold slower than observed with DNA templates. Moreover, it was not possible to accurately assess the selectivity of the exonuclease because extension of the next correct base was so slow even with a correctly paired primer terminus. Following the incorporation of a single base opposite an RNA template, the polymerase stalls and idles because of subsequent excision and reinsertion of nucleotides at a single site. Over time, the 16-fold selectivity of the exonuclease toward removal of mismatches would improve the overall fidelity of insertion at this position. The possible origins and eventual fate of the DNA/RNA heteroduplex in the mitochondria is not known. However, it is well established that during RNA polymerase-dependent initiation of DNA synthesis, a mitochondrial RNA processing RNase cleaves the RNA strands to produce primers for initiation of DNA synthesis (23Xu B. Kim D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3135-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 27Lee D.Y. Kim D.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because of the inability of the enzyme to polymerize processively, we believe that the reverse transcriptase activity is not likely to contribute significantly to the biology of mitochondrial DNA replication. However, the remarkably efficient incorporation of a single base opposite an RNA template is intriguing and will require further study to establish its possible physiological significance.

In this work, we used the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the ability of tailor-made zinc finger proteins to activate the expression of the FLO11 gene, with phenotypic consequences. Two three-finger peptides were identified, recognizing sites from the 5' UTR of the FLO11 gene with nanomolar DNA-binding affinity. The three-finger domains and their combined six-finger motif, recognizing an 18-bp site, were fused to the activation domain of VP16 or VP64. These transcription factor constructs retained their DNA-binding ability, with the six-finger ones being the highest in affinity. However, when expressed in haploid yeast cells, only one three-finger recombinant transcription factor was able to activate the expression of FLO11 efficiently. Unlike in the wild-type, cells with such transcriptional activation displayed invasive growth and biofilm formation, without any requirement for glucose depletion. The VP16 and VP64 domains appeared to act equally well in the activation of FLO11 expression, with comparable effects in phenotypic alteration. We conclude that the functional activity of tailor-made transcription factors in cells is not easily predicted by the in vitro DNA-binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W1997894744,"Gammaherpesviruses cause important infections of humans, in particular in immunocompromised patients. The genomes of gammaherpesviruses contain variable numbers of internal repeats whose precise role for in vivo pathogenesis is not well understood.We used infection of laboratory mice with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) to explore the biological role of the 40 bp internal repeat of MHV-68. We constructed several mutant viruses partially or completely lacking this repeat. Both in vitro and in vivo, the loss of the repeat did not substantially affect lytic replication of the mutant viruses. However, the extent of splenomegaly, which is associated with the establishment of latency, and the number of ex vivo reactivating and genome positive splenocytes were reduced. Since the 40 bp repeat is part of the hypothetical open reading frame (ORF) M6, it might function as part of M6 or as an independent structure. To differentiate between these two possibilities, we constructed an N-terminal M6STOP mutant, leaving the repeat structure intact but rendering ORF M6 unfunctional. Disruption of ORF M6 did neither affect lytic nor latent infection. In contrast to the situation in lytically infected NIH3T3 cells, the expression of the latency-associated genes K3 and ORF72 was reduced in the latently infected murine B cell line Ag8 in the absence of the 40 bp repeat.These data suggest that the 40 bp repeat contributes to latency amplification and might be involved in the regulation of viral gene expression."

However, only a small portion (< or = 1%) of the QTL detected have been characterized at the molecular level, despite the report of hundreds of thousands of QTL for different traits and populations.We develop a statistical model for detecting and characterizing the nucleotide structure and organization of haplotypes that underlie QTL responsible for a quantitative trait in an F2 pedigree. The discovery of such haplotypes by the new model will facilitate the molecular cloning of a QTL. Our model is founded on population genetic properties of genes that are segregating in a pedigree, constructed with the mixture-based maximum likelihood context and implemented with the EM algorithm. The closed forms have been derived to estimate the linkage and linkage disequilibria among different molecular markers, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, and quantitative genetic effects of haplotypes constructed by non-alleles of these markers. Results from the analysis of a real example in mouse have validated the usefulness and utilization of the model proposed.The model is flexible to be extended to model a complex network of genetic regulation that includes the interactions between different haplotypes and between haplotypes and environments."
https://openalex.org/W2004107890,"Bacillus anthracis, the etiologic agent of inhalational anthrax, is a facultative intracellular pathogen. Despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy, the mortality from inhalational anthrax approaches 45%, underscoring the need for better adjuvant therapies. The variable latency between exposure and development of disease suggests an important role for the host's innate immune response. Type I and Type II Interferons (IFN) are prominent members of the host innate immune response and are required for control of intracellular pathogens. We have previously described a protective role for exogenous Type I and Type II IFNs in attenuating intracellular B.anthracis germination and macrophage cell death in vitro.We sought to extend these findings in an in vivo model of inhalational anthrax, utilizing the Sterne strain (34F2) of B.anthracis. Mice devoid of STAT1, a component of IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma signaling, had a trend towards increased mortality, bacterial germination and extrapulmonary spread of B.anthracis at 24 hrs. This was associated with impaired IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 production. However, administration of exogenous IFN-gamma, and to a lesser extent IFN-alpha, at the time of infection, markedly increased lethality. While IFNs were able to reduce the fraction of germinated spores within the lung, they increased both the local and systemic inflammatory response manifest by increases in IL-12 and reductions in IL-10. This was associated with an increase in extrapulmonary dissemination. The mechanism of IFN mediated inflammation appears to be in part due to STAT1 independent signaling.In conclusion, while endogenous IFNs are essential for control of B.anthracis germination and lethality, administration of exogenous IFNs appear to increase the local inflammatory response, thereby increasing mortality."
