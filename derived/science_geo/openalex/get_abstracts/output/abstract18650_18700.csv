https://openalex.org/W1989073099,"Arachidonylethanolamide, an arachidonic acid derivative in porcine brain, was identified in a screen for endogenous ligands for the cannabinoid receptor. The structure of this compound, which has been named ""anandamide,"" was determined by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and was confirmed by synthesis. Anandamide inhibited the specific binding of a radiolabeled cannabinoid probe to synaptosomal membranes in a manner typical of competitive ligands and produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the electrically evoked twitch response to the mouse vas deferens, a characteristic effect of psychotropic cannabinoids. These properties suggest that anandamide may function as a natural ligand for the cannabinoid receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2058925610,"TUBERCULOSIS is responsible for one in four of all avoidable adult deaths in developing countries1. Increased frequency and accelerated fatality of the disease among individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus has raised worldwide concern that control programmes may be inadequate2, and the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has resulted in several recent fatal outbreaks in the United States3. Isonicotinic acid hydrazide (isoniazid, INH) forms the core of antituberculosis regimens; however, clinical isolates that are resistant to INH show reduced catalase activity and a relative lack of virulence in guinea-pigs4–7. Here we use mycobacterial genetics8,9 to study the molecular basis of INH resistance. A single M. tuberculosis gene, katG, encoding both catalase and peroxidase, restored sensitivity to INH in a resistant mutant of Mycobacterium smegmatis, and conferred INH susceptibility in some strains of Escherichia coli. Deletion of katG from the chromosome was associated with INH resistance in two patient isolates of M. tuberculosis."

https://openalex.org/W2077348914,"Vaccine protection against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the related simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in animal models is proving to be a difficult task. The difficulty is due in large part to the persistent, unrelenting nature of HIV and SIV infection once infection is initiated. SIV with a constructed deletion in the auxiliary gene nef replicates poorly in rhesus monkeys and appears to be nonpathogenic in this normally susceptible host. Rhesus monkeys vaccinated with live SIV deleted in nef were completely protected against challenge by intravenous inoculation of live, pathogenic SIV. Deletion of nef or of multiple genetic elements from HIV may provide the means for creating a safe, effective, live attenuated vaccine to protect against acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)."
https://openalex.org/W2039478144,"The yeast transcriptional activator GCN4 is 1 of over 30 identified eukaryotic proteins containing the basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA-binding motif. We have determined the crystal structure of the GCN4 bZIP element complexed with DNA at 2.9 A resolution. The bZIP dimer is a pair of continuous alpha helices that form a parallel coiled coil over their carboxy-terminal 30 residues and gradually diverge toward their amino termini to pass through the major groove of the DNA-binding site. The coiled-coil dimerization interface is oriented almost perpendicular to the DNA axis, giving the complex the appearance of the letter T. There are no kinks or sharp bends in either bZIP monomer. Numerous contacts to DNA bases and phosphate oxygens are made by basic region residues that are conserved in the bZIP protein family. The details of the bZIP dimer interaction with DNA can explain recognition of the AP-1 site by the GCN4 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2003962192,"Exposure of mammalian cells to DNA-damaging agents induces the ultraviolet (UV) response, involving transcription factor AP-1, composed of Jun and Fos proteins. We investigated the mechanism by which UV irradiation induces the c-jun gene. The earliest detectable step was activation of Src tyrosine kinases, followed by activation of Ha-Ras and Raf-1. The response to UV was blocked by tyrosine kinase inhibitors and dominant negative mutants of v-src, Ha-ras, and raf-1. This signaling cascade leads to increased phosphorylation of c-Jun on two serine residues that potentiate its activity. These results strongly suggest that the UV response is initiated at or near the plasma membrane rather than the nucleus. The response may be elicited by oxidative stress, because it is inhibited by elevation of intracellular glutathione. Using tyrosine kinase inhibitors, we demonstrate that the UV response has a protective function."
https://openalex.org/W1965398762,"The interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha)-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), a transcriptional activator, contains three proteins, termed ISGF3 alpha proteins, that reside in the cell cytoplasm until they are activated in response to IFN-alpha. Treatment of cells with IFN-alpha caused these three proteins to be phosphorylated on tyrosine and to translocate to the cell nucleus where they stimulate transcription through binding to IFN-alpha-stimulated response elements in DNA. IFN-gamma, which activates transcription through a different receptor and different DNA binding sites, also caused tyrosine phosphorylation of one of these proteins. The ISGF3 alpha proteins may be substrates for one or more kinases activated by ligand binding to the cell surface and may link occupation of a specific polypeptide receptor with activation of transcription of a set of specific genes."
https://openalex.org/W2037374883,"In vitro, when the B7 molecule on the surface of antigen-presenting cells binds to the T cell surface molecules CD28 and CTLA-4, a costimulatory signal for T cell activation is generated. CTLA4Ig is a soluble form of the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 and binds B7 with high avidity. CTLA4Ig treatment in vivo suppressed T cell-dependent antibody responses to sheep erythrocytes or keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Large doses of CTLA4Ig suppressed responses to a second immunization. Thus, costimulation by B7 is important for humoral immune responses in vivo, and interference with costimulation may be useful for treatment of antibody-mediated autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W2101852419,"The agouti (a) locus acts within the microenvironment of the hair follicle to regulate coat color pigmentation in the mouse. We have characterized a gene encoding a novel 131 amino acid protein that we propose is the one gene associated with the agouti locus. This gene is normally expressed in a manner consistent with a locus function, and, more importantly, its structure and expression are affected by a number of representative alleles in the agouti dominance hierarchy. In addition, we found that the pleiotropic effects associated with the lethal yellow (Ay) mutation, which include pronounced obesity, diabetes, and the development of neoplasms, are accompanied by deregulated overexpression of the agouti gene in numerous tissues of the adult animal."
https://openalex.org/W2006080840,"The transporter associated with the antigen processing 1 (TAP1) gene encodes a subunit for a transporter, presumed to be involved in the delivery of peptides across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to class I molecules. We have generated mice with a disrupted TAP1 gene using embryonic stem cell technology. TAP1-deficient mice are defective in the stable assembly and intracellular transport of class I molecules and consequently show severely reduced levels of surface class I molecules. These properties are strikingly similar to those described for the TAP2 mutant cell line RMA-S. Cells from the TAP1-deficient mice are unable to present cytosolic antigens to class I-restricted cytotoxic T cells. As predicted from the near absence of class I surface expression, TAP1-deficient mice lack CD4-8+ T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1994811047,"Programmed cell death is a physiological process that eliminates unwanted cells. The bcl-2 gene regulates programmed cell death in mammalian cells, but the way it functions is not known. Expression of the human bcl-2 gene in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans reduced the number of programmed cell deaths, suggesting that the mechanism of programmed cell death controlled by bcl-2 in humans is the same as that in nematodes."
https://openalex.org/W2089353735,"Cellular proteins associated with immunodeficiency viruses were identified by determination of the amino acid sequence of the proteins and peptides present in sucrose density gradient-purified human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). beta 2 microglobulin (beta 2m) and the alpha and beta chains of human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) DR were present in virus preparations at one-fifth the concentration of Gag on a molar basis. Antisera to HLA DR, beta 2 m, as well as HLA class I precipitated intact viral particles, suggesting that these cellular proteins were physically associated with the surface of the virus. Antisera to class I, beta 2m, and HLA DR also inhibited infection of cultured cells by both HIV-1 and SIV. The specific, selective association of these cellular proteins in a physiologically relevant manner has major implications for our understanding of the infection process and the pathogenesis of immunodeficiency viruses and should be considered in the design of vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2014158880,"Calcium-activated potassium channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes by injection of RNA transcribed in vitro from complementary DNAs derived from the slo locus of Drosophila melanogaster. Many cDNAs were found that encode closely related proteins of about 1200 aa. The predicted sequences of these proteins differ by the substitution of blocks of amino acids at five identified positions within the putative intracellular region between residues 327 and 797. Excised inside-out membrane patches showed potassium channel openings only with micromolar calcium present at the cytoplasmic side; activity increased steeply both with depolarization and with increasing calcium concentration. The single-channel conductance was 126 pS with symmetrical potassium concentrations. The mean open time of the channels was clearly different for channels having different substituent blocks of amino acids. The results suggest that alternative splicing gives rise to a large family of functionally diverse, calcium-activated potassium channels."
https://openalex.org/W2081669905,"The mammalian neocortex consists of a mosaic of columnar units whose development is poorly understood. Optical recordings of brain slices labeled with the fluorescent calcium indicator fura-2 revealed that the neonatal rat cortex was partitioned into distinct domains of spontaneously coactive neurons. In tangential slices, these domains were 50 to 120 micrometers in diameter; in coronal slices they spanned several cortical layers and resembled columns found in the adult cortex. In developing somatosensory cortex, domains were smaller than, and distinct from, the barrels, which represent sensory input from a single vibrissa. The neurons within each domain were coupled by gap junctions. Thus, nonsynaptic communication during cortical development defines discrete multicellular patterns that could presage adult functional architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2092734837,"In the mammalian nervous system, K+ channels regulate diverse aspects of neuronal function and are encoded by a large set of K+ channel genes. The roles of different K+ channel proteins could be dictated by their localization to specific subcellular domains. We report that two K+ channel polypeptides, Kv1.4 and Kv4.2, which form transient (A-type) K+ channels when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, are segregated in rat central neurons. Kv1.4 protein is targeted to axons and possibly terminals, while Kv4.2 is concentrated in dendrites and somata. This differential distribution implies distinct roles for these channel proteins in vivo. Their localizations suggest that Kv1.4 and Kv4.2 may regulate synaptic transmission via presynaptic, or postsynaptic mechanisms, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1973352434,"An in vitro evolution procedure was used to obtain RNA enzymes with a particular catalytic function. A population of 10(13) variants of the Tetrahymena ribozyme, a group I ribozyme that catalyzes sequence-specific cleavage of RNA via a phosphoester transfer mechanism, was generated. This enzyme has a limited ability to cleave DNA under conditions of high temperature or high MgCl2 concentration, or both. A selection constraint was imposed on the population of ribozyme variants such that only those individuals that carried out DNA cleavage under physiologic conditions were amplified to produce ""progeny"" ribozymes. Mutations were introduced during amplification to maintain heterogeneity in the population. This process was repeated for ten successive generations, resulting in enhanced (100 times) DNA cleavage activity."
https://openalex.org/W1992072758,A variant of the glycoprotein CD44 (CD44v) that shares sequences with variants causally involved in metastasis formation is transiently expressed on B and T lymphocytes and macrophages after antigenic stimulation and in the postnatal period. Antibodies to the variant hinder in vivo activation of both B and T cells. The observation that a protein domain that is expressed on CD44 and required for the lymphatic spread of tumor cells can catalyze an essential step in the process of lymphocyte activation supports the idea that metastasizing tumor cells mimic lymphocyte behavior.

https://openalex.org/W2031183620,"Trypanosoma cruzi invades most nucleated cells by a mechanism distinct from classical phagocytosis. Although parasites enter at the lysosome-poor peripheral cell margins, lysosomal markers are immediately incorporated into the parasitophorous vacuole. No accumulation of polymerized actin was detected around recently internalized parasites, and disruption of microfilaments significantly facilitated invasion. Lysosomes were observed to aggregate at the sites of trypanosome attachment and to fuse with the vacuole at early stages of its formation. Experimentally induced, microtubule-dependent movement of lysosomes from the perinuclear area to the cell periphery enhanced entry. Conditions that deplete cells of peripheral lysosomes or interfere with lysosomal fusion capacity inhibited invasion. These observations reveal a novel mechanism for cell invasion:recruitment of lysosomes for fusion at the site of parasite internalization."

https://openalex.org/W2082716386,Strains of the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica that contain viral double-stranded RNAs often exhibit reduced virulence. Such hypovirulent strains act as biocontrol agents by virtue of their ability to convert virulent strains to hypovirulence after anastomosis. Transformation of virulent C. parasitica strains with a full-length complementary DNA copy of a hypovirulence-associated viral RNA conferred the complete hypovirulence phenotype. Cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA was resurrected from the chromosomally integrated complementary DNA copy and was able to convert compatible virulent strains to hypovirulence. These results establish viral double-stranded RNA as the causal agent of hypovirulence and demonstrate the feasibility of engineering hypovirulent fungal strains.
https://openalex.org/W2051556688,"Adult rat sciatic nerve is known to express high levels of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) mRNA and protein. Here we examine the cellular localization of CNTF protein and mRNA in peripheral nerve and the regulation of CNTF expression by peripheral axons. In intact nerve, CNTF immunoreactivity is found predominantly in the cytoplasm of myelin-related Schwann cells. After axotomy, CNTF immunoreactivity and mRNA levels fall dramatically and do not recover unless axons regenerate. This behavior is similar to the pattern of myelin gene expression in these nerves. We conclude that the expression of CNTF in Schwann cells depends on axon-Schwann cell interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1979398938,"During generalized immune complex-induced inflammation of the peritoneal cavity, two peaks of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were observed in the peritoneal exudate of normal mice. In mast cell-deficient mice, the first peak was undetected, and the second peak of TNF and neutrophil influx were significantly reduced. Antibody to TNF significantly inhibited neutrophil infiltration in normal but not in mast cell-deficient mice. Mast cell repletion of the latter normalized TNF, neutrophil mobilization, and the effect of the antibody to TNF. Thus, in vivo, mast cells produce the TNF that augments neutrophil emigration."
https://openalex.org/W2061594885,"A Citrobacter sp. accumulates heavy deposits of metal phosphate, derived from an enzymically liberated phosphate ligand. The cells are not subject to saturation constraints and can accumulate several times their own weight of precipitated metal. This high capacity is attributable to biomineralization; uranyl phosphate accumulates as polycrystalline HUO2PO4 at the cell surface. The precipitated metal is indistinguishable from crystalline HUO2PO4.4H2O grown by chemical methods."
https://openalex.org/W2036707712,"Opiates and the opioid peptide enkephalin can cause indirect excitation of principal cortical neurons by reducing inhibitory synaptic transmission mediated by GABAergic interneurons. The mechanism by which opioids mediate these effects on interneurons is unknown, but enkephalin hyperpolarizes the somatic membrane potential of a variety of neurons in the brain, including hippocampal interneurons. We now report a new, more direct mechanism for the opioid-mediated reduction in synaptic inhibition. The enkephalin analog D-Ala2-Met5-enkephalinamide (DALA) decreases the frequency of miniature, action potential-independent, spontaneous GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) without causing a change in their amplitude. Thus, we conclude that DALA inhibits the action potential-independent release of GABA through a direct action on interneuronal synaptic terminals. In contrast, DALA reduces the amplitude of action potential-evoked, GABA-mediated IPSCs, as well as decreases their frequency. This suggests that the opioid-mediated inhibition of non-action potential-dependent GABA release reveals a mechanism that contributes to reducing action potential-evoked GABA release, thereby decreasing synaptic inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2087186850,"The role of S. cerevisiae YDJ1 protein (YDJ1p) in polypeptide translocation across membranes has been examined. A conditional ydj1 mutant strain (ydj1-151TS) is defective for import of several polypeptides into mitochondria and alpha factor into the endoplasmic reticulum at 37 degrees C. These defects are suppressed by E. coli dnaJ or overexpression of S. cerevisiae SIS1 proteins. A different ydj1 mutant, which cannot be farnesylated (ydj1-S406), displays similar transport defects to the ydj1-151 strain. Furthermore, the ability of purified ydj1-151p to stimulate the ATPase activity of hsp70SSA1 was greatly diminished compared with the wild-type protein. Together, these data suggest that YDJ1p functions in polypeptide translocation in a conserved manner, probably acting at organelle membranes and in association with hsp70 proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2064172773,"Hpall methylase (M. Hpall), an example of a DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase, was found to induce directly a high frequency of C→U transition mutations in double-stranded DNA. A mutant pSV2-neo plasmid, constructed with an inactivating T→C transition mutation creating a CCGG site, was incubated with M. Hpall in the absence of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). This caused an approximately 104-fold increase in the rate of reversion when the mutant neo plasmid was transformed into bacteria lacking uracil-DNA glycosylase. The mutation frequency was very sensitive to SAM concentration and was reduced to background when the concentration of the methyl donor exceeded 300 nM. The data support current models for the formation of a covalent complex between the methyltransferase and cytosine. They also suggest that the occurrence of mutational hot spots at CpG sites may not always be due to spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine, but might also be initiated by enzymatic deamination of cytosine and proceed through a C→U→T pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2017884204,"As a novel approach to studying the modulation of the polarized epithelial phenotype, we have expressed c-Fos and c-Myc estrogen receptor fusion proteins (c-FosER and c-MycER) in mammary epithelial cells. The hybrid proteins could be activated by estrogen for defined time periods and after the cells had achieved their fully polarized organization. Activation of c-MycER deregulated proliferation but did not affect epithelial polarity. Short-term activation of c-FosER induced the reversible loss of morphological and functional cell polarity. In contrast, long-term stimulation of c-FosER caused the cells to depolarize irreversibly, to invade collagen gels, and to undergo epithelial-fibroblastoid cell conversion. Our data suggest that Fos proteins are important in modulating the epithelial phenotype both in normal tissue development and in invasive processes."
https://openalex.org/W2141781497,"From the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, we have cloned a gene, YPT7, that encodes a GTP-binding protein belonging to the Ypt family of ras-related proteins. The 208 amino acid protein shares identical effector domain and C-terminal sequences with the mammalian Rab7 protein. YPT7 gene disruption did not impair cellular growth at temperatures ranging from 17 degrees C to 37 degrees C. ypt7 null mutants are characterized by highly fragmented vacuoles and differential defects of vacuolar protein transport and maturation. The uptake of alpha factor pheromone by wild-type and Ypt7p-deficient cells was found to be indistinguishable, but in mutant cells lacking Ypt7p, degradation of the endocytosed pheromone was severely inhibited. Our findings suggest a role of Ypt7p in protein transport between endosome-like compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1983307735,"The synaptic action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is terminated by high affinity, Na(+)-dependent transport processes in both neurons and glia. We have isolated a novel GABA transporter cDNA, GAT-B, which encodes a high affinity (Km = 2.3 microM), Na(+)- and Cl(-)-dependent GABA transport protein that is potently blocked by beta-alanine, a compound generally considered a selective inhibitor of glial transport. However, in situ hybridization studies indicate that GAT-B mRNA is expressed predominantly within neurons. These data indicate that the neuronal-glial distinction of GABA transporters based on inhibitor sensitivities must be reconsidered and suggest a greater diversity of GABA transporters than has been predicted by previous pharmacologic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2026117440,"A genetic method, the two-hybrid system, was used to identify four genes encoding proteins that interact with the SNF1 protein kinase from yeast. One of the genes, SIP1, was independently isolated as a multicopy suppressor of defects caused by reduced SNF1 kinase activity, and genetic evidence supports its function in the SNF1 pathway. The SIP1 protein co-immunoprecipitated with SNF1 and was phosphorylated in vitro. Thus, the two-hybrid system, which is applicable to any cloned gene, can be used to detect physical interactions between protein kinases and functionally related substrate proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1987634060,"The formation of specific neural connections in the cerebral cortex was studied using organotypic coculture preparations composed of subcortical and cortical regions. Morphological and electrophysiological analysis indicated that several cortical efferent and afferent connections, such as the corticothalamic, thalamocortical, corticocortical, and corticotectal connections, were established in the cocultures with essentially the same laminar specificity as that found in the adult cerebral cortex, but without specificity of sensory modality. This suggests the existence of a cell-cell recognition system between cortical or subcortical neurons and their final targets. This interaction produces lamina-specific connections, but is probably insufficient for the formation of the modality-specific connections."
https://openalex.org/W2036006596,"Lampreys and hagfishes (cyclostomes) traditionally were considered to be a natural (monophyletic) group. Recently, the consensus of opinion, based largely on morphological analyses, has shifted to a view that lampreys are more closely related to jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) than to hagfishes. Phylogenetic comparisons of 18S ribosomal RNA sequences from two hagfishes, two lampreys, a tunicate, a lancelet, and a number of gnathostomes support the monophyly of the cyclostomes. These data force a reassessment of several features of early vertebrate evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2020500832,"Although nonclassical (class I-b) gene products represent the majority of murine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, the role of these relatively nonpolymorphic molecules remains uncertain. Recently, one such protein, H-2M3 (formerly designated Hmt), was shown to bind and specifically present N-formylated peptides to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Because N-formylation is characteristic of prokaryotic proteins, this MHC molecule may be especially adapted for a role in the mammalian defense against bacterial attack. The current studies demonstrate that an MHC molecule, indistinguishable from H-2M3, presents antigens derived from the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes to Listeria-specific CD8+ cells."
https://openalex.org/W2047559880,"Membrane-anchored transforming growth factor α (proTGFα) belongs to a group of transmembrane proteins whose extracellular domains are selectively cleaved and released into the medium. We demonstrate that the carboxy-terminal valine in the cytoplasmic tail of proTGFα is required for cleavage of the growth factor ectodomain in response to various activators. This cleavage process occurs outside Golgi or lysosomal locations, affects cell surface proTGFα, and requires little or no membrane traffic. We propose that cleavage and release of proTGFα ectodomain involve a specialized proteolytic system and depend on the recognition of a simple and specific determinant located in the proTGFα cytoplasmic tail."
https://openalex.org/W1979441792,"Cellular determination in the Xenopus retina is not a strict consequence of cell lineage or cell birthdate. This suggests that a retinal cell gets its fate by either local cellular interactions, diffusible factors, or an indeterminate stochastic mechanism. We have performed an in vitro experiment in which cellular contact is controlled to test the first possibility directly. We use these experiments to demonstrate that two cellular inductions are involved in photoreceptor determination in vitro and that these inductions also occur during development in the retina in vivo. The first interaction is responsible for biasing cells toward either a generic photoreceptor or a cone fate, while the second directs cells toward a rod cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W2011907662,"The proto-oncogene products c-Fos and c-Jun heterodimerize through their leucine zippers to form the AP-1 transcription factor. The transcriptional activity of the heterodimer is regulated by signal-dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events. The stability of c-Fos was found to also be controlled by intracellular signal transduction. In transient expression and in vitro degradation experiments, the stability of c-Fos was decreased when the protein was dimerized with phosphorylated c-Jun. c-Jun protein isolated from phorbol ester-induced cells did not target c-Fos for degradation, which suggests that c-Fos is transiently stabilized after stimulation of cell growth. v-Fos protein, the retroviral counterpart of c-Fos, was not susceptible to degradation targeted by c-Jun."
https://openalex.org/W2034806435,"Optical methods were used to locate the cell bodies of directionally selective ganglion cells in isolated rabbit retinas. These neurons detect the direction in which images move across the retinal surface and transmit that information to the brain. The receptive field of each identified cell was determined, after which the cell was injected with Lucifer yellow. An image of the receptive field border was then projected onto the fluorescent image of the dendrites, allowing precise comparison between them. The size of the receptive field matched closely the size of the dendritic arbor of that cell. This result restricts the types of convergence that can be postulated in modeling the mechanism of retinal directional selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2078117164,"Serum and growth factors can increase the proportion of Ras in the active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound form. Growth factors might stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange or decrease the activity of the guanosine triphosphatase-activating proteins GAP and neurofibromin (NF1). In NIH 3T3 cells that overexpress the mutant Ras protein His116, which releases bound guanine nucleotide at a constitutively high rate and retains sensitivity to GAP and NF1, the proportion of GTP bound to the His116 protein was not altered by serum or platelet-derived growth factor. However, these mitogens increased the proportion of Ras in the GTP-bound form in cells that overexpressed control Ras proteins with a normal intrinsic rate of guanine nucleotide release. The amount of GTP-bound His116 or control Ras proteins was higher in cells at low density than in cells at high density, which have more GAP-like activity. The lower proportion of GTP-bound Ras in NIH 3T3 cells at high density may result from increased GAP-like activity. By contrast, serum and platelet-derived growth factors appear to stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange."
https://openalex.org/W2003996476,"The signal transduction mechanisms of interferons (IFNs) remain unclear partly because no effect of IFN has been reproducible in a cell-free system. IFN-α rapidly induces the transcription of a set of early response genes, and a multicomponent transcriptional activator, interferon stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), is activated within minutes after binding of IFN-α to its receptor. A system was developed in which IFN-α activated ISGF3 in homogenates of HeLa cells. Subcellular fractionation revealed that incubation of a plasma membrane-enriched fraction with IFN-α was sufficient to activate the regulatory subcomponent of ISGF3."

https://openalex.org/W2082464771,"Shaker B inactivating peptide (“ball peptide”, BP) interacts with Ca2+-activated K+ (Kca) channels from the cytoplasmic side only, producing inhibition of channel activity. This effect was reversible and dose and voltage dependent (stronger at depolarized potentials). The inhibition of Kca channels by BP cannot be mimicked by an inactive point mutation of the BP, L7E. BP binds to Kca channels in a bimolecular reaction (dissociation constant of 95 μM at + 40 mV). The binding site is probably located in the internal “mouth” or conduction pathway, since both external K+and internal tetraethylammonium relieve BP-induced inhibition. These results suggest that Kca channels possess a binding site for the BP with some properties similar to the ball receptor found in Shaker B K+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W2104788089,"A 20 amino acid synthetic peptide, corresponding to the amino-terminal region of the Shaker B (ShB) K+ channel and responsible for its fast inactivation, can block large conductance Ca2+-dependent K+ channels from rat brain and muscle. The ShB inactivation peptide produces two kinetically distinct blocking events in these channels. At lower concentrations, it produces short blocks, and at higher concentrations long-lived blocks also appear. The L7E mutant peptide produces only infrequent short blocks (no long-lived blocks) at a much higher concentration. Internal tetraethylammonium competes with the peptide for the short block, which is also relieved by K+ influx. These results suggest that the peptide induces the short block by binding within the pore of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels. The long block is not affected by increased K+ influx, indicating that the binding site mediating this block may be different from that involved in the short block. The short block of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels and the inactivation of Shaker exhibit similar characteristics with respect to blocking affinity and open pore blockade. This suggests a conserved binding region for the peptide in the pore regions of these very different classes of K+ channel."

https://openalex.org/W1968281040,"The world human population growth rate after World War II passed through three phases: the rise in the 1950s and 1960s, the fall (though still at a positive level) in the 1970s, and the plateau in the 1980s. The rise was produced by the global decline in death rates, the fall was mainly due to the reduction of fertility in a number of developing countries, and the stagnation of growth rate decline was attributable to three major factors. First, substantial fertility declines started around 1970 and stalled around 1980 in both China and India. Second, the age structure of population changed in favor of higher birth rates. Third, although fertility started to decline significantly around 1970 mainly in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, few countries have begun fertility declines since then. Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have not started substantial fertility reductions, deepening the gap between developing countries that are moving to lower fertility levels and those that are left behind."
