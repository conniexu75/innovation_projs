https://openalex.org/W2005200288,"Crystalline mesoporous molecular sieves have long been sought as solid acid catalysts for organic reactions involving large molecules. We synthesized a series of mesoporous molecular sieves that possess crystalline microporous walls with zeolitelike frameworks, extending the application of zeolites to the mesoporous range of 2 to 50 nanometers. Hexagonally ordered or disordered mesopores are generated by surfactant aggregates, whereas multiple cationic moieties in the surfactant head groups direct the crystallization of microporous aluminosilicate frameworks. The wall thicknesses, framework topologies, and mesopore sizes can be controlled with different surfactants. The molecular sieves are highly active as catalysts for various acid-catalyzed reactions of bulky molecular substrates, compared with conventional zeolites and ordered mesoporous amorphous materials."
https://openalex.org/W2123924700,"Fluorescent proteins with excitation and emission maxima in the near-infrared would be especially useful because of the low light absorbance of mammalian tissues in this optical window. Verkhusha and colleagues present a bright, photostable fluorescent protein with optimized near-infrared spectra that does not require the addition of exogenous co-factors. Imaging biological processes in mammalian tissues will be facilitated by fluorescent probes with excitation and emission bands within the near-infrared optical window of high transparency1. Here we report a phytochrome-based near-infrared fluorescent protein (iRFP) with excitation and emission maxima at 690 nm and 713 nm, respectively. iRFP does not require an exogenous supply of the chromophore biliverdin and has higher effective brightness, intracellular stability and photostability than earlier phytochrome-derived fluorescent probes. Compared with far-red GFP-like proteins, iRFP has a substantially higher signal-to-background ratio in a mouse model due to its infrared-shifted spectra."
https://openalex.org/W2094771034,"Interleukin-17-producing T helper (TH17) cells serve an important role in the immune system, but are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. How the immune system controls TH17 cells in vivo remains unclear. Using mice in which tolerance was induced by CD3-specific antibody, a model of sepsis and influenza A viral infection, Esplugues et al. demonstrate that TH17 cells are kept in check by redirecting the cells to the small intestine where they are eliminated or re-programmed to acquire immunosuppressive and regulatory properties. This work identifies the gastrointestinal tract as a site for control of TH17 cells. Interleukin (IL)-17-producing T helper cells (TH17) are a recently identified CD4+ T cell subset distinct from T helper type 1 (TH1) and T helper type 2 (TH2) cells1. TH17 cells can drive antigen-specific autoimmune diseases and are considered the main population of pathogenic T cells driving experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)2, the mouse model for multiple sclerosis. The factors that are needed for the generation of TH17 cells have been well characterized3,4,5,6. However, where and how the immune system controls TH17 cells in vivo remains unclear. Here, by using a model of tolerance induced by CD3-specific antibody, a model of sepsis and influenza A viral infection (H1N1), we show that pro-inflammatory TH17 cells can be redirected to and controlled in the small intestine. TH17-specific IL-17A secretion induced expression of the chemokine CCL20 in the small intestine, facilitating the migration of these cells specifically to the small intestine via the CCR6/CCL20 axis. Moreover, we found that TH17 cells are controlled by two different mechanisms in the small intestine: first, they are eliminated via the intestinal lumen; second, pro-inflammatory TH17 cells simultaneously acquire a regulatory phenotype with in vitro and in vivo immune-suppressive properties (rTH17). These results identify mechanisms limiting TH17 cell pathogenicity and implicate the gastrointestinal tract as a site for control of TH17 cells."

https://openalex.org/W2061681507,"Using two-photon calcium imaging in vivo and intracellular recordings in vitro, the authors find that visual stimulation only weakly modifies coactivation patterns of inhibitory neurons, whereas excitatory neuron correlations are largely stimulus dependent. Neuronal responses during sensory processing are influenced by both the organization of intracortical connections and the statistical features of sensory stimuli. How these intrinsic and extrinsic factors govern the activity of excitatory and inhibitory populations is unclear. Using two-photon calcium imaging in vivo and intracellular recordings in vitro, we investigated the dependencies between synaptic connectivity, feature selectivity and network activity in pyramidal cells and fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons in mouse visual cortex. In pyramidal cell populations, patterns of neuronal correlations were largely stimulus-dependent, indicating that their responses were not strongly dominated by functionally biased recurrent connectivity. By contrast, visual stimulation only weakly modified co-activation patterns of fast-spiking PV cells, consistent with the observation that these broadly tuned interneurons received very dense and strong synaptic input from nearby pyramidal cells with diverse feature selectivities. Therefore, feedforward and recurrent network influences determine the activity of excitatory and inhibitory ensembles in fundamentally different ways."
https://openalex.org/W2013438045,"Reward-motivated behavior is strongly influenced by the learned significance of contextual stimuli in the environment. However, the neural pathways that mediate context-reward relations are not well understood. We have identified a circuit from area CA3 of dorsal hippocampus to ventral tegmental area (VTA) that uses lateral septum (LS) as a relay. Theta frequency stimulation of CA3 excited VTA dopamine (DA) neurons and inhibited non-DA neurons. DA neuron excitation was likely mediated by disinhibition because local antagonism of γ-aminobutyric acid receptors blocked responses to CA3 stimulation. Inactivating components of the CA3-LS-VTA pathway blocked evoked responses in VTA and also reinstatement of cocaine-seeking by contextual stimuli. This transsynaptic link between hippocampus and VTA appears to be an important substrate by which environmental context regulates goal-directed behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2061683639,"For many years, it was thought that rods and cones were the only light-detecting cells in the mammalian retina, but about 20 years ago a third photoreceptor was identified, the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Expressing the photo-pigment melanopsin, these cells assist in the regulation of circadian photoentrainment and help to drive the pupillary light reflex. Chen et al. now show that these two functions are associated with distinct subpopulations of ipRGCs, defined by specific molecular factors and acting in parallel. Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) express the photopigment melanopsin and regulate a wide array of light-dependent physiological processes1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. Genetic ablation of ipRGCs eliminates circadian photoentrainment and severely disrupts the pupillary light reflex (PLR)12,13. Here we show that ipRGCs consist of distinct subpopulations that differentially express the Brn3b transcription factor, and can be functionally distinguished. Brn3b-negative M1 ipRGCs innervate the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, whereas Brn3b-positive ipRGCs innervate all other known brain targets, including the olivary pretectal nucleus. Consistent with these innervation patterns, selective ablation of Brn3b-positive ipRGCs severely disrupts the PLR, but does not impair circadian photoentrainment. Thus, we find that molecularly distinct subpopulations of M1 ipRGCs, which are morphologically and electrophysiologically similar, innervate different brain regions to execute specific light-induced functions."

https://openalex.org/W1983428971,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequent male malignancy and the second most common cause of cancer-related death in Western countries. Current clinical and pathological methods are limited in the prediction of postoperative outcome. It is becoming increasingly evident that small non-coding RNA (ncRNA) species are associated with the development and progression of this malignancy. To assess the diversity and abundance of small ncRNAs in PCa, we analyzed the composition of the entire small transcriptome by Illumina/Solexa deep sequencing. We further analyzed the microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures of 102 fresh-frozen patient samples during PCa progression by miRNA microarrays. Both platforms were cross-validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. Besides the altered expression of several miRNAs, our deep sequencing analyses revealed strong differential expression of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and transfer RNAs (tRNAs). From microarray analysis, we derived a miRNA diagnostic classifier that accurately distinguishes normal from cancer samples. Furthermore, we were able to construct a PCa prognostic predictor that independently forecasts postoperative outcome. Importantly, the majority of miRNAs included in the predictor also exhibit high sequence counts and concordant differential expression in Illumina PCa samples, supported by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. Our findings provide miRNA expression signatures that may serve as an accurate tool for the diagnosis and prognosis of PCa."
https://openalex.org/W2167045574,Cornelis Albers and colleagues identify NBEAL2 as the causative gene for gray platelet syndrome (GPS). Knockdown of this gene in zebrafish leads to spontaneous bleeding and defects in thrombocyte formation. Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is a predominantly recessive platelet disorder that is characterized by mild thrombocytopenia with large platelets and a paucity of α-granules; these abnormalities cause mostly moderate but in rare cases severe bleeding. We sequenced the exomes of four unrelated individuals and identified NBEAL2 as the causative gene; it has no previously known function but is a member of a gene family that is involved in granule development. Silencing of nbeal2 in zebrafish abrogated thrombocyte formation.

Proteomic analysis of sucrose-gradient subcellular fractions of platelets indicated that NBEAL2 localizes to the dense tubular system (endoplasmic reticulum) in platelets."
https://openalex.org/W2057228135,"The chromosomal translocations found in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) generate oncogenic fusion transcription factors with aberrant transcriptional regulatory properties. Although therapeutic targeting of most leukemia fusion proteins remains elusive, the posttranslational modifications that control their function could be targetable. We found that AML1-ETO, the fusion protein generated by the t(8;21) translocation, is acetylated by the transcriptional coactivator p300 in leukemia cells isolated from t(8;21) AML patients, and that this acetylation is essential for its self-renewal-promoting effects in human cord blood CD34(+) cells and its leukemogenicity in mouse models. Inhibition of p300 abrogates the acetylation of AML1-ETO and impairs its ability to promote leukemic transformation. Thus, lysine acetyltransferases represent a potential therapeutic target in AML."
https://openalex.org/W1974872064,"Specific human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), notably HLA-B*27 and HLA-B*57 allele groups, have long been associated with control of HIV-1. Although the majority of HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells lose proliferative capacity during chronic infection, T cells restricted by HLA-B*27 or HLA-B*57 allele groups do not. Here we show that CD8(+) T cells restricted by 'protective' HLA allele groups are not suppressed by T(reg) cells, whereas, within the same individual, T cells restricted by 'nonprotective' alleles are highly suppressed ex vivo. This differential sensitivity of HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells to T(reg) cell-mediated suppression correlates with their expression of the inhibitory receptor T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) after stimulation with their cognate epitopes. Furthermore, we show that HLA-B*27- and HLA-B*57-restricted effectors also evade T(reg) cell-mediated suppression by directly killing T(reg) cells they encounter in a granzyme B (GzmB)-dependent manner. This study uncovers a previously unknown explanation for why HLA-B*27 and HLA-B*57 allele groups are associated with delayed HIV-1 disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2053251449,"Some organs in animals display left-right (LR) asymmetry. To better understand LR asymmetric morphogenesis in Drosophila, we studied LR directional rotation of the hindgut epithelial tube. Hindgut epithelial cells adopt a LR asymmetric (chiral) cell shape within their plane, and we refer to this cell behavior as planar cell-shape chirality (PCC). Drosophila E-cadherin (DE-Cad) is distributed to cell boundaries with LR asymmetry, which is responsible for the PCC formation. Myosin ID switches the LR polarity found in PCC and in DE-Cad distribution, which coincides with the direction of rotation. An in silico simulation showed that PCC is sufficient to induce the directional rotation of this tissue. Thus, the intrinsic chirality of epithelial cells in vivo is an underlying mechanism for LR asymmetric tissue morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2062768198,"The human POK family members are transcription factors with a POZ domain and zinc-fingers that act primarily as transcriptional repressors. Several members of this family are involved in oncogenesis and this prompted us to assess whether expression levels of individual POK family members are associated with clinical outcomes in cancer. We have observed that ZBTB4 (zinc-finger and BTB domain containing 4) is downregulated in breast cancer patients, and that its expression is significantly correlated with relapse-free survival. Further integrative analysis of mRNA and microRNA (miR) expression data from the NCI-60 cell lines revealed an inverse correlation between ZBTB4 and oncogenic miRs derived from the miR-17-92 cluster and its paralogs. The experimental results using MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells confirm that miRNAs derived from these clusters, containing miR-17-5p, miR-20a, miR-106a, miR-106b and miR-93, negatively regulate ZBTB4 expression. Overexpression of ZBTB4 or restoration of ZBTB4 by using an antagomir inhibit growth and invasion of breast cancer cells, and this effect is due, in part, to ZBTB4-dependent repression of the specificity protein 1 (Sp1), Sp3 and Sp4 genes, and subsequent downregulation of several Sp-dependent oncogenes, in part, through competition between ZBTB4 and Sp transcription factors for GC-rich promoter sequences. These results confirm that ZBTB4 functions as a novel tumor-suppressor gene with prognostic significance for breast cancer survival, and the oncogenic miR-17-92/ZBTB4/Sp axis may be a potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2168827637,"During early lung development, airway tubes change shape. Tube length increases more than circumference as a large proportion of lung epithelial cells divide parallel to the airway longitudinal axis. We show that this bias is lost in mutants with increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and ERK2 activity, revealing a link between the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and the control of mitotic spindle orientation. Using a mathematical model, we demonstrate that change in airway shape can occur as a function of spindle angle distribution determined by ERK1/2 signaling, independent of effects on cell proliferation or cell size and shape. We identify sprouty genes, which encode negative regulators of fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10)-mediated RAS-regulated ERK1/2 signaling, as essential for controlling airway shape change during development through an effect on mitotic spindle orientation."
https://openalex.org/W2018209199,"DNA methylation-dependent epigenetic mechanisms underlie the development and function of the mammalian brain. MeCP2 is highly expressed in neurons and functions as a molecular linker between DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. Previous in vitro studies have shown that neuronal activity-induced phosphorylation (NAIP) of methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) precedes its release from the Bdnf promoter and the ensuing Bdnf transcription. However, the in vivo function of this phosphorylation event remains elusive. We generated knock-in mice that lack NAIP of MeCP2 and found that they performed better in hippocampus-dependent memory tests, presented enhanced long-term potentiation at two synapses in the hippocampus and showed increased excitatory synaptogenesis. At the molecular level, the phospho-mutant MeCP2 protein bound more tightly to several MeCP2 target gene promoters and altered the expression of these genes. Our results suggest that NAIP of MeCP2 is required for modulating dynamic functions of the adult mouse brain."
https://openalex.org/W2133847359,"Muscle atrophy prevails in numerous diseases (cancer cachexia, renal failure, infections, etc.), mainly results from elevated proteolysis, and is accelerated by bed rest. This largely contributes to increased health costs. Devising new strategies to prevent muscle wasting is a major clinical challenge. The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) degrades myofibrillar proteins, but the precise mechanisms responsible for actin breakdown are surprisingly poorly characterized. We report that chimeric flag-actin was destabilized and polyubiquitinylated in stably transfected C2C12 myotubes treated with the catabolic agent dexa-methasone (1 μM) and that only proteasome inhibitors blocked its breakdown. Actin polyubiquitinylation was also detected in wild-type C2C12 myotubes and human muscle biopsies from control participants and patients with cancer. The muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase MuRF1 is up-regulated in catabolic conditions and polyubiquitinylates components of the thick filament. We also demonstrate that recombinant GST-MuRF1 physically interacted and polyubiquitinylated actin in vitro and that MuRF1 is a critical component for actin breakdown, since MuRF1 siRNA stabilized flag-actin. These data identify unambiguously the abundant contractile protein actin as a target of the UPS in skeletal muscle both in vitro and in vivo, further supporting the need for new strategies blocking specifically the activation of this pathway in muscle wasting conditions.—Polge, C., Heng, A.-E., Jarzaguet, M., Ventadour, S., Claustre, A., Combaret, L., Béchet, D., Matondo, M., Uttenweiler-Joseph, S., Monsarrat, B., Attaix, D., Taillandier, D.

https://openalex.org/W1998412189,"Proteins containing a caveolin-binding domain (CBD), such as the Rho-GTPases, can interact with caveolin-1 (Cav1) through its caveolin scaffold domain. Rho-GTPases are important regulators of p130(Cas), which is crucial for both normal cell migration and Src kinase-mediated metastasis of cancer cells. However, although Rho-GTPases (particularly RhoC) and Cav1 have been linked to cancer progression and metastasis, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. To investigate the function of Cav1-Rho-GTPase interaction in metastasis, we disrupted Cav1-Rho-GTPase binding in melanoma and mammary epithelial tumor cells by overexpressing CBD, and examined the loss-of-function of RhoC in metastatic cancer cells. Cancer cells overexpressing CBD or lacking RhoC had reduced p130(Cas) phosphorylation and Rac1 activation, resulting in an inhibition of migration and invasion in vitro. The activity of Src and the activation of its downstream targets FAK, Pyk2, Ras and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2 were also impaired. A reduction in α5-integrin expression, which is required for binding to fibronectin and thus cell migration and survival, was observed in CBD-expressing cells and cells lacking RhoC. As a result of these defects, CBD-expressing melanoma cells had a reduced ability to metastasize in recipient mice, and impaired extravasation and survival in secondary sites in chicken embryos. Our data indicate that interaction between Cav1 and Rho-GTPases (most likely RhoC but not RhoA) promotes metastasis by stimulating α5-integrin expression and regulating the Src-dependent activation of p130(Cas)/Rac1, FAK/Pyk2 and Ras/Erk1/2 signaling cascades."
https://openalex.org/W1972822698,"Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) regulates multiple processes that are important for cell proliferation, and it is a promising anticancer drug target. Efforts to inhibit Plk1 function by disrupting interactions that are essential for its proper localization identify a high-affinity alkylated phosphopeptide ligand specific for Plk1. We obtained unanticipated synthetic byproducts from alkylation of the δ1 nitrogen (N3) of the histidine imidazole ring of the polo-like kinase-1 (Plk1) polo-box domain (PBD)-binding peptide PLHSpT. For the highest-affinity byproduct, bearing a C6H5(CH2)8– group, a Plk1 PBD cocrystal structure revealed a new binding channel that had previously been occluded. An N-terminal PEGylated version of this peptide containing a hydrolytically stable phosphothreonyl residue (pT) bound the Plk1 PBD with affinity equal to that of the non-PEGylated parent but showed markedly less interaction with the PBDs of the two closely related proteins Plk2 and Plk3. Treatment of cultured cells with this PEGylated peptide resulted in delocalization of Plk1 from centrosomes and kinetochores and in chromosome misalignment that effectively induced mitotic block and apoptotic cell death. This work provides insights that might advance efforts to develop Plk1 PBD-binding inhibitors as potential Plk1-specific anticancer agents."
https://openalex.org/W2152740213,"Translation initiation plays a critical role in cellular homeostasis, proliferation, differentiation and malignant transformation. Consistently, increasing the abundance of the eIF2-GTP-tRNA(i)(Met) translation initiation complex transforms normal cells and contributes to cancer initiation and the severity of some anemias. The chemical modifiers of the eIF2-GTP-tRNA(i)(Met) ternary complex are therefore invaluable tools for studying its role in the pathobiology of human disorders and for determining whether this complex can be pharmacologically targeted for therapeutic purposes. Using a cell-based assay, we identified N,N'-diarylureas as unique inhibitors of ternary complex accumulation. Direct functional-genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrated that the N,N'-diarylureas activate heme-regulated inhibitor kinase, thereby phosphorylating eIF2α and reducing the abundance of the ternary complex. Using tumor cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo as paradigms, we demonstrate that N,N'-diarylureas are potent and specific tools for studying the role of eIF2-GTP-tRNA(i)(Met) ternary complex in the pathobiology of human disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2062336370,"BRCA1 mutation-associated breast cancer originates in oestrogen receptor-alpha-negative (ER(-)) progenitors in the mammary luminal epithelium. These cells also express high levels of the Kit gene and a recent study demonstrated a correlation between Brca1 loss and Kit over-expression in the mammary epithelium. However, the functional significance of c-Kit expression in the mammary gland is unknown. To address this, c-Kit(-) and c-Kit(+) mammary epithelial subsets were isolated by flow cytometry, characterised for expression of lineage-specific cell markers and functionally analysed by in vitro colony forming and in vivo transplantation assays. The results confirm that the majority of luminal ER(-) progenitors are c-Kit(+), but also that most stem cells and the differentiated cell populations are c-Kit(-). A subset of c-Kit(+) cells with high proliferative potential was found in the luminal ER(+) population, however, suggesting the existence of a distinct luminal ER(+) progenitor cell type. Analysis of mouse Brca1 mammary tumours demonstrated that they expressed Kit and its downstream effector Lyn at levels comparable to the most strongly c-Kit(+) luminal ER(-) progenitors. Consistent with c-Kit being a progenitor cell marker, in vitro three-dimensional differentiation of c-Kit(+) cells resulted in a loss of c-Kit expression, whereas c-Kit over-expression prevented normal differentiation in vivo. Furthermore, c-Kit was a functional marker of proliferative potential, as c-Kit inhibition by short hairpin knockdown prevented normal epithelial growth and caused cells to undergo apoptosis. Therefore, c-Kit defines distinct progenitor populations in the mammary epithelium and is critical for mammary progenitor survival and proliferation. Importantly, c-Kit is only the second mammary epithelial stem/progenitor marker to be shown to have a functional role in the mammary epithelium and the first marker to be shown to be required for progenitor cell function. The c-Kit signalling network has potential as a target for therapy and/or prevention in BRCA1-associated breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2079138011,"Making associations between sensory stimuli is a critical aspect of behavior. We previously found that neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of Macaca mulatta reflect learned associations between directions of moving visual stimuli. Individual LIP neurons might encode associations only for specific stimuli, such as motion directions; alternatively, they may encode more general associations whenever animals must decide between discrete alternatives. To test this, we asked whether LIP neurons encode learned associations between pairs of arbitrarily chosen static shapes and, in a separate task, whether the same neurons also encode associations between motion directions. Our experimental design dissociated the visual associations from the movements used to report those associations. We found robust encoding of the learned pair associations between shapes, and shape-pair-selective neurons tended to be selective for direction associations. These findings suggest that representing generic categorical outcomes may be a fundamental role of parietal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2003614202,"The catalytic centre of the ribosome is composed solely of RNA. This means that it lacks the varied side groups found in proteins that can assist in catalysis, so it was thought that its functions were merely to bring messenger RNA and charged transfer RNAs into close proximity. Not so. Analysis of the kinetic isotope effect at five positions within the reaction centre of a peptidyl-transfer RNA mimic shows that the ribosome also enhances catalysis of peptide-bond formation by modifying the rate-limiting transition state. This finding has implications for work on the origin of life and the transition from an RNA world. The chemical step of natural protein synthesis, peptide bond formation, is catalysed by the large subunit of the ribosome. Crystal structures have shown that the active site for peptide bond formation is composed entirely of RNA1. Recent work has focused on how an RNA active site is able to catalyse this fundamental biological reaction at a suitable rate for protein synthesis. On the basis of the absence of important ribosomal functional groups2 , lack of a dependence on pH3, and the dominant contribution of entropy to catalysis4, it has been suggested that the role of the ribosome is limited to bringing the substrates into close proximity. Alternatively, the importance of the 2′-hydroxyl of the peptidyl-transfer RNA5 and a Brønsted coefficient near zero6 have been taken as evidence that the ribosome coordinates a proton-transfer network. Here we report the transition state of peptide bond formation, based on analysis of the kinetic isotope effect at five positions within the reaction centre of a peptidyl-transfer RNA mimic. Our results indicate that in contrast to the uncatalysed reaction, formation of the tetrahedral intermediate and proton transfer from the nucleophilic nitrogen both occur in the rate-limiting step. Unlike in previous proposals, the reaction is not fully concerted; instead, breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate occurs in a separate fast step. This suggests that in addition to substrate positioning, the ribosome is contributing to chemical catalysis by changing the rate-limiting transition state."
https://openalex.org/W1971576227,"The GXGD proteases are polytopic membrane proteins with catalytic activities against membrane-spanning substrates that require a pair of aspartyl residues. Representative members of the family include preflagellin peptidase, type 4 prepilin peptidase, presenilin and signal peptide peptidase. Many GXGD proteases are important in medicine. For example, type 4 prepilin peptidase may contribute to bacterial pathogenesis, and mutations in presenilin are associated with Alzheimer's disease. As yet, there is no atomic-resolution structure in this protease family. Here we report the crystal structure of FlaK, a preflagellin peptidase from Methanococcus maripaludis, solved at 3.6 Å resolution. The structure contains six transmembrane helices. The GXGD motif and a short transmembrane helix, helix 4, are positioned at the centre, surrounded by other transmembrane helices. The crystal structure indicates that the protease must undergo conformational changes to bring the GXGD motif and a second essential aspartyl residue from transmembrane helix 1 into close proximity for catalysis. A comparison of the crystal structure with models of presenilin derived from biochemical analysis reveals three common transmembrane segments that are similarly arranged around the active site. This observation reinforces the idea that the prokaryotic and human proteases are evolutionarily related. The crystal structure presented here provides a framework for understanding the mechanism of the GXGD proteases, and may facilitate the rational design of inhibitors that target specific members of the family."
https://openalex.org/W2013130822,"p53 is a crucial tumor suppressor that is mutated or deleted in a majority of cancers. Exactly how p53 prevents tumor progression has proved elusive for many years; however, this information is crucial to define targets for chemotherapeutic development that can effectively restore p53 function. Bioactive sphingolipids have recently emerged as important regulators of proliferative, apoptotic and senescent cellular processes. In this study, we demonstrate that the enzyme sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1), a critical enzyme in the regulation of the key bioactive sphingolipids ceramide, sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), serves as a key downstream target for p53 action. Our results show that SK1 is proteolysed in response to genotoxic stress in a p53-dependent manner. p53 null mice display elevation of SK1 levels and a tumor-promoting dysregulation of bioactive sphingolipids in which the anti-growth sphingolipid ceramide is decreased and the pro-growth sphingolipid S1P is increased. Importantly, deletion of SK1 in p53 null mice completely abrogated thymic lymphomas in these mice and prolonged their life span by ~30%. Deletion of SK1 also significantly attenuated the formation of other cancers in p53 heterozygote mice. The mechanism of p53 tumor suppression by loss of SK1 is mediated by elevations of sphingosine and ceramide, which in turn were accompanied by increased expression of cell cycle inhibitors and tumor cell senescence. Thus, targeting SK1 may restore sphingolipid homeostasis in p53-dependent tumors and provide insights into novel therapeutic approaches to cancer."

We studied the dependence of this classification on visual context by comparing, in the same cell, the synaptic responses to three classical receptive field mapping protocols: sparse noise, ternary dense noise and flashed Gabor noise. Intracellular recordings revealed that the relative weights of simple-like and complex-like receptive field components were scaled so as to make the same receptive field more simple-like with dense noise stimulation and more complex-like with sparse or Gabor noise stimulations. However, once these context-dependent receptive fields were convolved with the corresponding stimulus, the balance between simple-like and complex-like contributions to the synaptic responses appeared to be invariant across input statistics. This normalization of the linear/nonlinear input ratio suggests a previously unknown form of homeostatic control of V1 functional properties, optimizing the network nonlinearities to the statistical structure of the visual input."
https://openalex.org/W1985937576,"Increased androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity mediated by coactivator proteins may drive castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) growth. Vav3, a Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), is overexpressed in human prostate cancers, particularly in models of CRPC progression. Vav3 coactivates AR in a Vav3 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-dependent but GEF-independent manner. Ectopic expression of Vav3 in androgen-dependent human prostate cancer cells conferred robust castration-resistant xenograft tumor growth. Vav3 but not a Vav3 PH mutant greatly stimulated interaction between the AR amino and carboxyl termini (N-C interaction), which is required for maximal receptor transcriptional activity. Vav3 was distributed between the cytoplasm and nucleus with nuclear localization-dependent on the Vav3 PH domain. Membrane targeting of Vav3 abolished Vav3 potentiation of AR activity, whereas nuclear targeting of a Vav3 PH mutant rescued AR coactivation, suggesting that nuclear localization is an important function of the Vav3 PH domain. A nuclear role for Vav3 was further demonstrated by sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, which revealed that Vav3 and AR were recruited to the same transcriptional complexes of an AR target gene enhancer. These data demonstrate the importance of Vav3 in CRPC and define a novel nuclear function of Vav3 in regulating AR activity."
https://openalex.org/W2170456753,"The phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRL) family, comprising PRL-1, PRL-2 and PRL-3, is a group of prenylated phosphatases that are candidate cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Although several studies have documented that altered expression of PRL-1 or PRL-3 can influence cell proliferation, migration and invasion, there is a dearth of knowledge about the biological functions of PRL-2. Thus, in the current study we have evaluated the role of PRL-2 in cell migration and invasion in human cancer cells. We found that four human lung cancer cells, including A549 cells, overexpress PRL-2 when compared with normal lung cells. PRL-2 knockdown by RNA interference markedly inhibited cell migration and invasion, and this inhibition can be restored by overexpressing the short interference RNA (siRNA)-resistant vector HA-PRL-2m. PRL-2 suppression by siRNA decreased p130Cas and vinculin expression, and decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, while increasing the phosphorylation of ezrin on tyrosine 146. We found no significant changes in total p53, Akt and c-Src expression levels or their phosphorylation status, suggesting that PRL-2 knockdown could inhibit tumor cell migration and invasion through a Src-independent p130Cas signaling pathway. Ectopic expression of wild-type PRL-2, a catalytic inactive C101S mutant and a C-terminal CAAX deletion revealed a requirement for both the PRL-2 catalytic functionality and prenylation site. Expression of wild-type but not mutant forms of PRL-2 caused ERK phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. These results support a model in which PRL-2 promotes cell migration and invasion through an ERK-dependent signaling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2079353837,"PAX5 encodes a master regulator of B-cell development. It fuses to other genes associated with acute lymphoblastoid leukemia (ALL). These fusion products are potent dominant-negative (DN) inhibitors of wild-type PAX5, resulting in a blockade of B-cell differentiation. Here, we show that multimerization of PAX5 DNA-binding domain (DBD) is necessary and sufficient to cause extremely stable chromatin binding and DN activity. ALL-associated PAX5-C20S results from fusion of the N-terminal region of PAX5, including its paired DBD, to the C-terminus of C20orf112, a protein of unknown function. We report that PAX5-C20S is a tetramer, which interacts extraordinarily stably with chromatin as determined by Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching in living cells. Tetramerization, stable chromatin binding and DN activity all require a putative five-turn amphipathic α-helix at the C-terminus of C20orf112, and does not require potential corepressor binding peptides elsewhere in the sequence. In vitro, the monomeric PAX5 DBD and PAX5-C20S binds a PAX5-binding site with equal affinity when it is at the center of an oligonucleotide too short to bind to more than one PAX5 DBD. But, PAX5-C20S binds the same sequence with 10-fold higher affinity than the monomeric PAX5 DBD when it is in a long DNA molecule. We suggest that the increased affinity results from interactions of one or more of the additional DBDs with neighboring non-specific sites in a long DNA molecule, and that this can account for the increased stability of PAX5-C20S chromatin binding compared with wild-type PAX5, resulting in DN activity by competition for binding to PAX5-target sites. Consistent with this model, the ALL-associated PAX5 fused to ETV6 or the multimerization domain of ETV6 SAM results in stable chromatin binding and DN activity. In addition, PAX5 DBD fused to artificial dimerization, trimerization and tetramerization domains results in parallel increases in the stability of chromatin binding and DN activity. Our studies suggest that oncogenic fusion proteins that retain the DBD of the transcription factor (TF) and the multimerization sequence of the partner protein can act in a DN manner by multimerizing and binding avidly to gene targets, preventing the normal TF from binding and inducing expression of its target genes. Inhibition of this multimeriztion may provide a novel therapeutic approach for cancers with this or similar fusion proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2109545571,"Abrogation of functional p53 is responsible for malignant cell transformation and maintenance of human papilloma virus (HPV)-infected cancer cells. Restoration of p53 has, therefore, been regarded as an important strategy for molecular intervention of HPV-associated malignancies. Here we report that differential regulation of pro- and anti-p53 setups not only upregulates p53 transcription but also stabilizes and activates p53 protein to ensure p53-induced apoptosis in HPV-18-infected cervical cancer. Functional restoration of p53 can be achieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib via multiple molecular mechanisms: (i) inhibition of p53 degradation by suppressing viral oncoprotein E6 expression, (ii) promoting p53 transcription by downmodulating cycloxygenase-2 (Cox-2) and simultaneously retrieving p53 from Cox-2 association and (iii) activation of p53 via ataxia telangiectasia mutated-/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated phosphorylations at serine-15/-46 residues. That restored p53 is functional has been confirmed by its ability of transactivating Bax and p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis, which in turn switch on the apoptotic machinery in these cells. Studies undertaken in biopsy samples of cervical carcinoma further validated celecoxib effect. Our approaches involving gene manipulation and pharmacological interference finally highlight that celecoxib alters pro- and anti-p53 networks, not in isolation but in concert, to rejuvenate p53-dependent apoptotic program in HPV-infected cervical cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1963815208,"Here, we show that activation of the checkpoint effector kinase Chk1 in response to irradiation-induced DNA damage is minimal in G1, maximal during S-phase and diminishes as cells enter G2. In addition, formation of irradiation-induced replication protein A (RPA)-coated single-stranded DNA (RPA–ssDNA), a structure required for ATM and Rad3-related (ATR)–Chk1 activation, occurs in a broadly similar pattern. Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activity is thought to promote RPA–ssDNA formation by stimulating DNA strand resection at double-strand breaks (DSBs), providing one possible mechanism of imposing cell cycle dependence on DNA damage signaling. However, it has recently been shown that Chk1 itself is also subject to Cdk-mediated phosphorylation at serines 286 and 301 (S286 and 301). We show that Chk1 S301 phosphorylation increases as cells progress through S and G2 and that both Cdk1 and Cdk2 are likely to contribute to this modification in vivo. We also find that substitution of S286 and S301 with non-phosphorylatable alanine residues strongly attenuates DNA damage-induced Chk1 activation and G2 checkpoint proficiency, but does not eliminate the underlying cell cycle dependence of Chk1 regulation. Taken together, these data indicate that Cdk activity regulates multiple steps in the DNA damage response pathway including full activation of Chk1 and checkpoint proficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2053675903,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) may serve as a useful target for drug development in non-diabetic diseases. However, some colorectal cancer cells are resistant to PPARγ agonists by mechanisms that are poorly understood. Here, we provide the first evidence that elevated PPARδ expression and/or activation of PPARδ antagonize the ability of PPARγ to induce colorectal carcinoma cell death. More importantly, the opposing effects of PPARδ and PPARγ in regulating programmed cell death are mediated by survivin and caspase-3. We found that activation of PPARγ results in decreased survivin expression and increased caspase-3 activity, whereas activation of PPARδ counteracts these effects. Our findings suggest that PPARδ and PPARγ coordinately regulate cancer cell fate by controlling the balance between the cell death and survival and demonstrate that inhibition of PPARδ can reprogram PPARγ ligand-resistant cells to respond to PPARγ agonists."
https://openalex.org/W2061375242,"CHEK2 encodes a serine/threonine kinase (Chk2) activated by ATM in response to DNA double-strand breaks. On the one hand, CHEK2 has been described as a tumor suppressor with proapoptotic, cell-cycle checkpoint and mitotic functions. On the other hand, Chk2 is also commonly activated (phosphorylated at T68) in cancers and precancerous lesions. Here, we report an extensive characterization of CHEK2 across the panel of 60 established cancer cell lines from the NCI Anticancer Screen (the NCI-60) using genomic and proteomic analyses, including exon-specific mRNA expression, DNA copy-number variation (CNV) by aCGH, exome sequencing, as well as western blot analyses for total and activated (pT68-Chk2) Chk2. We show that the high heterogeneity of Chk2 levels in cancer cells is primarily due to its inactivation (owing to low gene expression, alternative splicing, point mutations, copy-number alterations and premature truncation) or reduction of protein levels. Moreover, we observe that a significant percentage of cancer cells (12% of the NCI-60 and HeLa cells) show high endogenous Chk2 activation, which is always associated with p53 inactivation, and which is accompanied by downregulation of the Fanconi anemia and homologous recombination pathways. We also report the presence of activated Chk2 (pT68-Chk2) along with histone γ-H2AX in centrosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2079291490,"The p53 tumor suppressor gene encodes a transcription factor that is commonly mutated in cancer. Tumors arise when premalignant cells are unable to undergo p53-dependent apoptosis, cell cycle arrest or DNA repair. The p53-signaling pathway affects not only tumor development, but also the response of tumors to chemotherapeutic drugs. In this study, we use cell penetrating peptide conjugates of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMOs) to inhibit p53 expression. We examine the functional properties of endogenous p53 isoforms that are produced upon PPMO-mediated inhibition of p53 translation and splicing, and report that loss of N-terminal or C-terminal sequences interferes with the transcriptional activity of p53. Importantly, we report that PPMO-mediated inhibition of p53 expression sensitizes human cancer cells with wild-type p53 to chemotherapeutic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2054011395,"Wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (WIP1) is a serine/threonine phosphatase that dephosphorylates proteins in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-initiated DNA damage response pathway. WIP1 may have a homeostatic role in ATM signaling by returning the cell to a normal pre-stress state following completion of DNA repair. To better understand the effects of WIP1 on ATM signaling, we crossed Atm-deficient mice to Wip1-deficient mice and characterized phenotypes of the double knockout progeny. We hypothesized that the absence of Wip1 might rescue Atm deficiency phenotypes. Atm null mice, like ATM-deficient humans with the inherited syndrome ataxia telangiectasia, exhibit radiation sensitivity, fertility defects, and are T-cell lymphoma prone. Most double knockout mice were largely protected from lymphoma development and had a greatly extended lifespan compared with Atm null mice. Double knockout mice had increased p53 and H2AX phosphorylation and p21 expression compared with their Atm null counterparts, indicating enhanced p53 and DNA damage responses. Additionally, double knockout splenocytes displayed reduced chromosomal instability compared with Atm null mice. Finally, doubly null mice were partially rescued from gametogenesis defects observed in Atm null mice. These results indicate that inhibition of WIP1 may represent a useful strategy for cancer treatment in general and A-T patients in particular."
https://openalex.org/W2165211727,"During human glomerulonephritis, the severity of injuries correlates with glomerular fibrin deposits, which are tightly regulated by the intraglomerular fibrinolytic system. Here, we evaluated the role of vitronectin (VTN; also known as complement S protein), the principal cofactor of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), in a mouse model of acute glomerulonephritis. We found that in mice subjected to nephrotoxic serum, the absence of VTN resulted in a lower glomerular PAI-1 activity and a higher glomerular fibrinolytic activity. Challenged VTN–/– mice displayed significantly less fibrin deposits, proteinuria, and renal failure than their wild-type counterparts. Notably, this protective effect afforded by VTN deficiency was still observed after a C3 depletion. Finally, the injection of VTN+/+ serum in VTN–/– mice induced the glomerular deposition of VTN, increased PAI-1 deposition, decreased glomerular fibrinolytic activity, and aggravated glomerular injury. As in mice, abundant glomerular VTN deposits were also observed in patients with severe glomerulonephritis. Here, we show that plasma-exchange therapy, admittedly beneficial in this clinical context, induces a significant depletion in circulating VTN, which might modulate PAI-1 activity locally and accelerate the clearance of fibrin deposits in the glomeruli. Collectively, these results demonstrate that VTN exerts a deleterious role independently from complement, by directing PAI-dependent fibrinolysis in the glomerular compartment.—Mesnard, L., Rafat, C., Vandermeersch, S., Hertig, A., Cathelina, D., Xu-Dubois, Y.-C., Jouanneau, C., Castro Keller, A., Ribeil, J. –A., Leite-de-Moraes, M.
