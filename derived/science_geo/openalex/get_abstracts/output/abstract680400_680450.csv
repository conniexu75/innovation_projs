https://openalex.org/W3198276338,"Pneumonia is a respiratory infection caused by bacteria or viruses; it affects many individuals, especially in developing and underdeveloped nations, where high levels of pollution, unhygienic living conditions, and overcrowding are relatively common, together with inadequate medical infrastructure. Pneumonia causes pleural effusion, a condition in which fluids fill the lung, causing respiratory difficulty. Early diagnosis of pneumonia is crucial to ensure curative treatment and increase survival rates. Chest X-ray imaging is the most frequently used method for diagnosing pneumonia. However, the examination of chest X-rays is a challenging task and is prone to subjective variability. In this study, we developed a computer-aided diagnosis system for automatic pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images. We employed deep transfer learning to handle the scarcity of available data and designed an ensemble of three convolutional neural network models: GoogLeNet, ResNet-18, and DenseNet-121. A weighted average ensemble technique was adopted, wherein the weights assigned to the base learners were determined using a novel approach. The scores of four standard evaluation metrics, precision, recall, f1-score, and the area under the curve, are fused to form the weight vector, which in studies in the literature was frequently set experimentally, a method that is prone to error. The proposed approach was evaluated on two publicly available pneumonia X-ray datasets, provided by Kermany et al. and the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), respectively, using a five-fold cross-validation scheme. The proposed method achieved accuracy rates of 98.81% and 86.85% and sensitivity rates of 98.80% and 87.02% on the Kermany and RSNA datasets, respectively. The results were superior to those of state-of-the-art methods and our method performed better than the widely used ensemble techniques. Statistical analyses on the datasets using McNemar's and ANOVA tests showed the robustness of the approach.

https://openalex.org/W3197145442,"Raman spectroscopy has shown to be a promising method for the examination of biomedical samples. However, until now, its efficacy has not been established in clinical diagnostics. In this study, Raman spectroscopy's potential application in medical laboratories is evaluated for a large variety (38) of biomarkers. Given 234 serum samples from a cohort of patients with different stages of liver disease, we performed Raman spectroscopy at 780nm excitation wavelength. The Raman spectra were analyzed in combination with the results of routine diagnostics using specifically developed complex mathematical algorithms, including fluorescence filtering, frequency subset selection and several overfitting circumventing strategies, such as independent validation. With the results of this cohort, which were validated in 328 independent samples, a significant proof-of-concept study was completed. This study highlights the need to prevent overfitting and to use independent data for validation. The results reveal that Raman spectroscopy has high potential for use in medical laboratory diagnostics to simultaneously quantify multiple biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W3196341526,"Background and purpose The study analyzed the association of functionally significant polymorphisms of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) genes with the development of gastric ulcer (GU) in Caucasians from Central Russia. Methods The 781 participants, including 434 patients with GU (196 Helicobacter pylori ( H . pylori )-positive and 238 H . pylori -negative) and 347 controls (all H . pylori -negative) were recruited for the study. Ten SNPs of the MMP1 (rs1799750), MMP2 (rs243865), MMP3 (rs679620), MMP8 (rs1940475), and MMP9 (rs3918242, rs3918249, rs3787268, rs17576, rs17577, and rs2250889) genes were considered for association with GU using multiple logistic regression. The SNPs associated with GU and loci linked (r 2 ≥0.8) to them were analyzed in silico for their functional assignments. Results The SNPs of the MMP9 gene were associated with H . pylori -positive GU: alleles C of rs3918249 (OR = 2.02, p perm = 0.008) and A of rs3787268 (OR = 1.60–1.82, p perm ≤ 0.016), and eight haplotypes of all studied MMP9 gene SNPs (OR = 1.85–2.04, p perm ≤ 0.016) increased risk for H . pylori -positive GU. None of the analyzed SNPs was independently associated with GU and H . pylori -negative GU. Two haplotypes of the MMP9 gene (contributed by rs3918242, rs3918249, rs17576, and rs3787268) increased risk for GU (OR = 1.62–1.65, p perm ≤ 0.006). Six loci of the MMP9 gene, which are associated with H . pylori -positive GU, and 65 SNPs linked to them manifest significant epigenetic effects, have pronounced eQTL (17 genes) and sQTL (6 genes) values. Conclusion SNPs of the MMP9 were associated with H . pylori -positive GU but not with H . pylori -negative GU in Caucasians of Central Russia."
https://openalex.org/W3196949155,"The etiology of diverticulosis is still poorly understood. However, in patients with diverticulitis, markers of mucosal inflammation and microbiota alterations have been found. The aim of this study was to evaluate potential differences of the gut microbiota composition and mucosal immunity between patients with asymptomatic diverticulosis and controls.We performed a prospective study on patients who underwent routine colonoscopy for causes not related to diverticular disease or inflammatory bowel disease. Participants were grouped based on the presence or absence of diverticula. Mucosal biopsies were obtained from the sigmoid and transverse colon. Microbiota composition was analyzed with IS-pro, a 16S-23S based bacterial profiling technique. To predict if patients belonged to the asymptomatic diverticulosis or control group a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) regression model was used. Inflammation was assessed by neutrophil and lymphocyte counts within the taken biopsies.Forty-three patients were enrolled. Intestinal microbiota profiles were highly similar within individuals for all phyla. Between individuals, microbiota profiles differed substantially but regardless of the presence (n = 19) of absence (n = 24) of diverticula. Microbiota diversity in both sigmoid and transverse colon was similar in all participants. We were not able to differentiate between diverticulosis patients and controls with a PLS-DA model. Mucosal lymphocyte counts were comparable among both groups; no neutrophils were detected in any of the studied biopsies.Microbiota composition and inflammatory markers were comparable among asymptomatic diverticulosis patients and controls. This suggests that the gut microbiota and mucosal inflammation do not play a major role in the pathogenesis of diverticula formation."
https://openalex.org/W3197784195,"This study aims to explore whether higher education and science popularization can achieve coordinated growth with temporal and spatial characteristics. Selecting the provincial regions of the Yangtze River Economic Belt in China as cases with data from the national statistics administrations (such as China Statistical Yearbook), this study uses entropy weight analysis, TOPSIS, GM(1,1) gray prediction methods and coupling coordination degree model to evaluate the coordinated growth status. The key findings are: (1) the annual budget per student, and the number of science and technology museums affect both systems more obviously; (2) the overall performances of science popularization fluctuate more obviously than those of higher education; (3) the coordinated growth performances of the two systems in most regions remain mild fluctuations and keep relatively stable coordinated status, however, temporal and spatial variation tendencies do exist among regions. Therefore, corresponding countermeasures should be implemented: generally, national authority needs to involve in coordination activities among regions; the regions with satisfactory coordinated growth performances need more creative approaches to maintain the coordinated growth interactions; the regions at the transitioning status need to prevent the grade decline and upgrade the performances; the regions with lagging performances need to stop the decline and reduce the gaps with others. The novelties include analyzing the coordinated growth interaction mechanism between the two, selecting indices to assess the abstract interaction mechanism precisely, proposing suggestions based on temporal and spatial comparisons of the coordinated growth performances, etc."
https://openalex.org/W3198344596,"The desire for fresh, local food has increased interest in alternative food production approaches, such as private small-scale agriculture, wherein households grow their own food. Accordingly, it is worth investigating private agricultural production, especially in urban areas, given that an increasing share of the world's population is living in cities. This study analyzed the growth of produce at people's homes and in community gardens, focusing on behavioral and socio-demographic factors. Data were collected through an online survey in Detroit, Michigan; 420 citizens were interviewed. The results revealed that trust, attitude, and knowledge affect the growing of produce at home. Involvement and personality are also drivers of community gardening. Regarding socio-demographics, household size affects the growing of produce at home, while gender, age, and income affect community gardening. The findings have valuable implications for stakeholders who wish to foster private small-scale urban agriculture, for example, through city planning and nutrition education."
https://openalex.org/W3198206213,"Background Mobile technology has spread rapidly around the globe. In 2018 the numbers of mobile subscribers in Ethiopia hit 66.2 million. Musculoskeletal complaints related to smartphone use in different body parts have been reported ranging from 8.2% to 89.9%. Neck pain has the highest prevalence rate, which ranges from 17.3% to 67.8%. However, there is limited evidence on the burden of neck pain related to Smartphone usage and no research is done in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the burden of neck pain and factors associated with smartphone use in Ethiopia. Purpose The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence and factors associated with neck pain among smartphone users at University of Gondar. Methods Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted from November to December 2019 to determine the prevalence and associated factors of neck pain, with a sample of 845 university student smartphone users at University of Gondar, Ethiopia. A self-administered questionnaire adapted from the Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire was used to collect data. Independent variables which had a significant association were identified using logistic regression models. Results were reported by using texts and frequency distribution tables. Results Out of 845 questionnaires distributed, 808 students responded; hence, the response rate was 95.6%. The overall prevalence of neck pain among smart phone users in the past 12 months was 47.4% (95% CI, 44.1–50.9%). Attending 5 th year (AOR: 3.907, 95% CI: 1. 952–7.82) and 6 th year (AOR: 2.93,95% CI: 1,304–6.59), regular physical exercise (AOR: 2.405, 95% CI: 1.549–3.734), cigarette smoking (AOR: 5.415, 95% CI: 2.685–10.919), residency (AOR: 1.681, 95% CI: 1.181–2.391), break while using smartphone (AOR: 3.253 95% CI: 2.252–4.699), used smartphone &gt; 6 hour per day (AOR: 2.782 (1.528 95% CI: 1.528–5.063), used other devises (AOR: 3.158 95% CI: 2.128–4.689), number of social media used daily (AOR: 2.007 95% CI: 1.228–3.2788), used devise for playing game (AOR: 1.484 95% CI: 1.024–2.15) were factors significantly associated with neck pain. Conclusion The current study depicted that nearly half of the study participants reported neck pain in the past 12 months. Attending last year of university, personal characteristics, use of smart phone for longer period, playing game, not taking break, other electronic device use, increased number of social media use were associated with neck pain among smartphone users."

https://openalex.org/W3198847116,"Dog importation data from 2018–2020 were evaluated to ascertain whether the dog importation patterns in the United States changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically with regard to denial of entry. Dog denial of entry reports from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2020, stored within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Quarantine Activity Reporting System (QARS), were reviewed. Basic descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Reason for denial, country of origin, and month of importation were all examined to determine which countries of origin resulted in the largest number of denials, and whether there was a seasonal change in importations during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020), compared to previous years (2018 and 2019). During 2020, CDC denied entry to 458 dogs. This represents a 52% increase in dogs denied entry compared to the averages in 2018 and 2019. Dogs were primarily denied entry for falsified rabies vaccination certificates (56%). Three countries exported 74% of all dogs denied entry into the United States, suggesting that targeted interventions may be needed for certain countries. Increased attempts to import inadequately vaccinated dogs from countries with canine rabies in 2020 may have been due to the increased demand for domestic pets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Educational messaging should highlight the risk of rabies and the importance of making informed pet purchases from foreign entities to protect pet owners, their families, and the public."
https://openalex.org/W3197435883,"Cross-pollination affects the fruit characteristics of many crops but the effects of cross-pollination on fruit quality of strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) are poorly known. This study determined how cross-pollination affects fruit quality of the strawberry cultivar, Redlands Joy, under controlled environment conditions. Plants were allocated to one of four treatments, with all flowers on each plant receiving either: (1) unassisted self-pollination (Autogamy); (2) hand-pollination with Redlands Joy pollen (Self); (3) hand-pollination with cross-pollen from a small-fruited cultivar (Sugarbaby); or (4) hand-pollination with cross-pollen from a large-fruited cultivar (Rubygem). Cross-pollination did not significantly affect plant yield or fruit mass, size, shape, firmness or shelf life. However, cross-pollination affected fruit colour and taste attributes. Cross-pollinated fruit were 3%-5% darker than self-pollinated fruit. They also had 26%-34% lower acidity and 43%-58% higher Brix:acid ratio. Cross-pollination by Sugarbaby increased fruit P, K, Ca, Fe and Mn, but decreased B, Cu and Zn, concentrations. Cross-pollination by Rubygem increased fruit Mn, but decreased K and Na, concentrations and reduced shelf life. Fruit mass, length, diameter and firmness within all treatments increased with increasing numbers of fertilized seeds per fruit. Hand self-pollinated fruit had a higher percentage of fertilized seeds than fruit arising from autogamy and they were also darker, redder, firmer, and had a longer shelf life, higher protein concentration, and lower Al and Na concentrations. The results indicate that strawberry fruit quality can be affected by both the source of pollen and the number of stigmas pollinated."
https://openalex.org/W3198688897,"Increasing the diversity of research participants is an important focus of clinical trials. However, little is known regarding who enrolls as healthy volunteers in Phase I clinical trials, which test the safety and tolerability of investigational new drugs. Despite the risk, healthy volunteers can derive no medical benefit from their participation, and they are financially compensated for enrolling.This study's purpose is to describe sociodemographic characteristics and clinical trial participation histories of healthy people who enroll in US Phase I trials.The HealthyVOICES Project (HVP) is a longitudinal study of healthy individuals who have enrolled in Phase I trials. We describe self-reported sociodemographic information and Phase I trial history from HVP recruitment (May-December 2013) through the project's end three years later (December 2016). Trial experiences are presented as medians and quartiles.The HVP included 178 participants. Nearly three-fourths of participants were male, and two-thirds were classified as racial and ethnic minorities. We found that some groups of participants were more likely to have completed a greater number of clinical trials over a longer timeframe than others. Those groups included participants who were male, Black, Hispanic, 30-39-years-old, unemployed, had received vocational training in a trade, or had annual household incomes of less than $25,000. Additionally, the greater the number of clinical trials participants had completed, the more likely they were to continue screening for new trials over the course of three years. Participants who pursued clinical trials as a full-time job participated in the greatest number of trials and were the most likely to continuing screening over time.Participation as a healthy volunteer in US Phase I trials is driven by social inequalities. Disadvantaged groups tend to participate in a greater number of clinical trials and participate longer than more privileged groups."
https://openalex.org/W3196954376,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that affects thinking, memory, and behavior. Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) is a recently identified common neurodegenerative disease that mimics the clinical symptoms of AD. The development of drugs to prevent or treat these neurodegenerative diseases has been slow, partly because the genes associated with these diseases are incompletely understood. A notable hindrance from data analysis perspective is that, usually, the clinical samples for patients and controls are highly imbalanced, thus rendering it challenging to apply most existing machine learning algorithms to directly analyze such datasets. Meeting this data analysis challenge is critical, as more specific disease-associated gene identification may enable new insights into underlying disease-driving mechanisms and help find biomarkers and, in turn, improve prospects for effective treatment strategies. In order to detect disease-associated genes based on imbalanced transcriptome-wide data, we proposed an integrated multiple random forests (IMRF) algorithm. IMRF is effective in differentiating putative genes associated with subjects having LATE and/or AD from controls based on transcriptome-wide data, thereby enabling effective discrimination between these samples. Various forms of validations, such as cross-domain verification of our method over other datasets, improved and competitive classification performance by using identified genes, effectiveness of testing data with a classifier that is completely independent from decision trees and random forests, and relationships with prior AD and LATE studies on the genes linked to neurodegeneration, all testify to the effectiveness of IMRF in identifying genes with altered expression in LATE and/or AD. We conclude that IMRF, as an effective feature selection algorithm for imbalanced data, is promising to facilitate the development of new gene biomarkers as well as targets for effective strategies of disease prevention and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3197266909,"Posttraumatic fibrotic scarring is a significant medical problem that alters the proper functioning of injured tissues. Current methods to reduce posttraumatic fibrosis rely on anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative agents with broad intracellular targets. As a result, their use is not fully effective and may cause unwanted side effects. Our group previously demonstrated that extracellular collagen fibrillogenesis is a valid and specific target to reduce collagen-rich scar buildup. Our previous studies showed that a rationally designed antibody that binds the C-terminal telopeptide of the α2(I) chain involved in the aggregation of collagen molecules limits fibril assembly in vitro and reduces scar formation in vivo . Here, we have utilized a clinically relevant arthrofibrosis model to study the broad mechanisms of the anti-scarring activity of this antibody. Moreover, we analyzed the effects of targeting collagen fibril formation on the quality of healed joint tissues, including the posterior capsule, patellar tendon, and subchondral bone. Our results show that blocking collagen fibrillogenesis not only reduces collagen content in the scar, but also accelerates the remodeling of healing tissues and changes the collagen fibrils’ cross-linking. In total, this study demonstrated that targeting collagen fibrillogenesis to limit arthrofibrosis affects neither the quality of healing of the joint tissues nor disturbs vital tissues and organs."
https://openalex.org/W3197794720,"Background In the year 2019, around 5 million children under age five died and most of the deaths happened in developing countries. Though large numbers of deaths are reported in such countries, limited availability of data poses a substantial challenge on generating reliable estimates. Hence, this study aims to assess the prevalence and factors associated with under-five mortality in southeastern Ethiopia. Methods A register based cross sectional study was conducted from 1 st September 2014 to July 2019 in Asella teaching and referral hospital. A total of 4901 under-five age children registered on the admission and discharge book of pediatric ward with complete information were included for the analysis. Data entry and analysis were conducted using Epidata Version 7 and SPSS version 21, respectively. Descriptive statistics were used to explore the characteristics of the study participants and their condition at discharge. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with its 95% Confidence interval and P-value less than 5% was used to decide the statistically significant association. Results The prevalence of under-five mortality among admitted children in Asella Teaching and Referral hospital was 8.7% (95% CI 7.91–9.50%). Post-Neonatal and Child mortality were found to be 9.1% and 8.18%, respectively. Moreover, large numbers of death (45.2%) were seen within the first 2 days of admission. Address (AOR:1.4(1.08–1.81)), HIV status (AOR:4.64 (2.19–9.8)), severe acute malnutrition (AOR:2.82 (2.03–3.91)), hypovolemic shock (AOR:4.32 (2.31–8.1)), type I diabetes with DKA (AOR:3.53(1.34–9.29) and length of stay in the hospital for ≤2 days (AOR: 4.28 (3.09–5.95)) as well as 3–4 days (AOR: 1.48 (1.02–2.15)) were among the identified predictors. Conclusions Though childhood mortality is swiftly decreasing, and access and utilization of health care is improving in Ethiopia, our study found large prevalence of under-five mortality, 8.7% and higher number of deaths in early days of admission. Improving the quality of service has a paramount importance in reducing the mortality and managing associated factors contributing to under-five mortality among admitted children."
https://openalex.org/W3198051368,"There have been no studies on the effects of polyhexamethylene guanidine phosphate (PHMG) after a long period of exposure in the rodent model. We aimed to evaluate long-term lung damage after PHMG exposure using conventional chest computed tomography (CT) and histopathologic analysis in a rat model. A PHMG solution was intratracheally administrated to 24 male rats. At 8, 26, and 52 weeks after PHMG instillation, conventional chest CT was performed in all rats and both lungs were extracted for histopathologic evaluation. At 52 weeks after PHMG instillation, four carcinomas had developed in three of the eight rats (37.5%). Bronchiolo-alveolar hyperplasia and adenoma were found in rats at 8, 26, and 52 weeks post-instillation. The number of bronchiolo-alveolar hyperplasia significantly increased over time (P-value for trend< 0.001). The severity of lung fibrosis and fibrosis scores significantly increased over time (P-values for trend = 0.002 and 0.023, respectively). Conventional chest CT analysis showed that bronchiectasis and linear density scores suggestive of fibrosis significantly increased over time (P-value for trend < 0.001). Our study revealed that one instillation of PHMG in a rat model resulted in lung carcinomas and progressive and irreversible fibrosis one year later based on conventional chest CT and histopathologic analysis. PHMG may be a lung carcinogen in the rat model."
https://openalex.org/W3198152633,"The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) is often used to assess and compare hospital performance. While it has been recognized that hospitals may differ in their SMRs due to differences in patient composition, there is a lack of rigorous analysis of this and other-largely unrecognized-properties of the SMR.This paper proposes five axiomatic requirements for adequate standardized mortality measures: strict monotonicity (monotone relation to actual mortality rates), case-mix insensitivity (independence of patient composition), scale insensitivity (independence of hospital size), equivalence principle (equal rating of hospitals with equal actual mortality rates in all patient groups), and dominance principle (better rating of unambiguously better performing hospitals). Given these axiomatic requirements, effects of variations in patient composition, hospital size, and actual and expected mortality rates on the SMR were examined using basic algebra and calculus. In this regard, we distinguished between standardization using expected mortality rates derived from a different dataset (external standardization) and standardization based on a dataset including the considered hospitals (internal standardization). The results were illustrated by hypothetical examples.Under external standardization, the SMR fulfills the axiomatic requirements of strict monotonicity and scale insensitivity but violates the requirement of case-mix insensitivity, the equivalence principle, and the dominance principle. All axiomatic requirements not fulfilled under external standardization are also not fulfilled under internal standardization. In addition, the SMR under internal standardization is scale sensitive and violates the axiomatic requirement of strict monotonicity.The SMR fulfills only two (none) out of the five proposed axiomatic requirements under external (internal) standardization. Generally, the SMRs of hospitals are differently affected by variations in case mix and actual and expected mortality rates unless the hospitals are identical in these characteristics. These properties hamper valid assessment and comparison of hospital performance based on the SMR."
https://openalex.org/W3198711500,"This study aimed to investigate and compare the anatomical features of the nasolacrimal drainage system (NDS) in three brachycephalic dog breeds with those of normocephalic dogs, taking into account how the NDS was related to the malformed brachycephalic head.Fifty-one brachycephalic dogs were examined, comprising 23 Pugs, 18 French Bulldogs, and 10 English Bulldogs. Six normocephalic dogs of different breeds served as a comparison.Computed tomographic dacryocystography was performed. Parameters such as length, angulation, and gradient were determined. Crossing of the nasolacrimal duct (NLD) beneath the maxillary canine root, as well as the incidence of an accessory opening, were also analyzed.In all three brachycephalic breeds, the NDS was grossly malformed. We regard this as a further consequence of exaggerated breeding for a short head conformation. While the length of the NLD was substantially reduced by 41 to 57 percent in brachycephalic dogs, their lacrimal canaliculi were two to three times as long as those of normocephalic dogs. Varying parts of the nasolacrimal drainage system followed an inverse direction in short-headed dogs, giving the entire nasolacrimal apparatus an anomalous U- or V-shaped appearance. The NLD exhibited a three to five times steeper alignment in brachycephalic dogs than in normocephalic ones. Obviously, this strong slope did not cause clinical symptoms only because there was an aberrant outflow pathway. The brachycephalic dogs consistently exhibited an accessory opening, through which most of fluid escaped into the posterior nasal cavity instead of through the common route into the nasal vestibule via the nasolacrimal ostia."

The present study aimed to evaluate the associations between variants in dopaminergic pathway genes with stress resilience. Subjects of the present study were divided into four groups. Group A included persons with normal reactions to major life events stressors; group B included persons with an acute stress reaction to major life events stressor; group C included persons with normal reactions to Crises/catastrophes stressors, and group D included persons with an acute stress reaction to Crises/catastrophes stressors. DNA was extracted from the subject's blood, and the entire length of 14 genes DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, DRD5, COMT, DBH, TH, MAOA, DDC, DAT, 5-HTT, BDNF, and GDNF were sequenced by automated sequencers ABI 3700. Results showed 24 point mutations in 12 genes, including 16 SNPs and six novel mutations, which were significantly correlated to low-stress resilience. Most of the SNPs were known as risk alleles in psychiatric disorders. Several associations were found between genetic variants and psychological characteristics. Findings suggest dopaminergic as an important pathway in stress and stress resilience also indicated shared genetic bases between low-stress resilience and several psychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3197841541,"The importance of workers’ well-being has been recognized in recent years. The assessment of well-being has been subjective, and few studies have sought potential biomarkers of well-being to date. This study examined the relationship between well-being and the LF/HF ratio, an index of heart rate variability that reflects sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activity. Pulse waves were measured using photoplethysmography through a web camera attached to the computer used by each participant. The participants were asked to measure their pulse waves while working for 4 weeks, and well-being was assessed using self-reported measures such as the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and the Flourishing Scale (FS). Each of the well-being scores were split into two groups according to the median value, and the LF/HF ratio during work, as well as the number of times an LF/HF ratio threshold was either exceeded or subceeded, were compared between the high and low SWLS, positive emotion, negative emotion, and FS groups. Furthermore, to examine the effects of the LF/HF ratio and demographic characteristics on well-being, a multiple regression analysis was conducted. Data were obtained from 169 participants. The results showed that the low FS group had a higher mean LF/HF ratio during work than the high FS group. No significant differences were seen between the high and low SWLS groups, the high and low positive emotion groups, or the high and low negative emotion groups. The multiple regression analysis showed that the mean LF/HF ratio during work affected the FS and SWLS scores, and the number of times the mean LF/HF ratio exceeded +3 SD had an effect on the positive emotion. No effect of the LF/HF ratio on negative emotions was shown. The LF/HF ratio might be applicable as an objective measure of well-being."
https://openalex.org/W3197842732,"Whether use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce the risk of incident Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unresolved. Here, we employed the Norwegian Prescription Database to examine whether NSAID use is associated with a lower incidence of PD.We compared the incidence of PD among users of NSAIDs in a population-based retrospective study using the Norwegian Prescription Database from 2004 to 2017. In total 7580 PD patients were identified using dopaminergic therapy over time as proxy for PD diagnosis. Analyses were performed with minimum 90 and 365 defined daily dose (DDD) NSAID exposure, respectively. Time-dependent Cox regression model and a binary logistic regression analysis with a 5-year lag until PD diagnosis were performed for all NSAIDs.There was overall no decrease in incidence of PD among NSAID users compared to controls. Using a minimum of 90 or 365 DDD threshold of exposure produced similar results. Analysis of individual NSAIDs did not show difference in PD incidence compared to controls Age-specific incidence rates of PD were comparable to reported age-specific incidence rates in previous studies.Our findings provide no evidence that cumulative high exposure to NSAIDs affects the risk of developing PD."
https://openalex.org/W3198069922,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus that causes large outbreaks world-wide leaving millions of people with severe and debilitating arthritis. Interestingly, clinical presentation of CHIKV arthritides have many overlapping features with rheumatoid arthritis including cellular and cytokine pathways that lead to disease development and progression. Currently, there are no specific treatments or vaccines available to treat CHIKV infections therefore advocating the need for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat CHIKV rheumatic disease. Herein, we provide an in-depth analysis of an efficacious new treatment for CHIKV arthritis with a semi-synthetic sulphated polysaccharide, Pentosan Polysulfate Sodium (PPS). Mice treated with PPS showed significant functional improvement as measured by grip strength and a reduction in hind limb foot swelling. Histological analysis of the affected joint showed local inflammation was reduced as seen by a decreased number of infiltrating immune cells. Additionally, joint cartilage was protected as demonstrated by increased proteoglycan staining. Using a multiplex-immunoassay system, we also showed that at peak disease, PPS treatment led to a systemic reduction of the chemokines CXCL1, CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL7 (MCP-3) and CCL12 (MCP-5) which may be associated with the reduction in cellular infiltrates. Further characterisation of the local effect of PPS in its action to reduce joint and muscle inflammation was performed using NanoString™ technology. Results showed that PPS altered the local expression of key functional genes characterised for their involvement in growth factor signalling and lymphocyte activation. Overall, this study shows that PPS is a promising treatment for alphaviral arthritis by reducing inflammation and protecting joint integrity."
https://openalex.org/W3196980718,"Plastic surgery is growing in popularity. Despite this, there has been little exploration to date regarding the psychosocial consequences of seeking plastic surgery. Our study investigated how women seeking plastic surgery are perceived by others. We presented a random sample of 985 adults (men = 54%, M age = 35.84 years, SD age = 10.59) recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk with a series of experimental stimuli consisting of a photographed woman (attractive versus unattractive) and a vignette describing an activity she plans to engage in (plastic surgery versus control activity). Participants rated stimuli on perceived warmth, competence, morality, and humanness. We ran linear mixed-effect models to assess all study hypotheses. There was a negative plastic surgery effect; that is, women seeking plastic surgery were perceived less favorably than those planning to complete control activities across all outcome variables (warmth, competence, morality, and humanness). These relationships were moderated by physical attractiveness; while attractive women planning to undergo plastic surgery were perceived less favorably than attractive women planning to engage in control activities, perceptions of unattractive individuals remained unchanged by plastic surgery status. We theorized that empathy toward unattractive women seeking plastic surgery mitigated the negative plastic surgery effect for these women. In sum, our results suggest that perceptions of attractive women are worsened when these women decide to seek cosmetic surgery. Perceptions of warmth and competence have implications for an individual’s self-esteem and interpersonal relationships, while perceptions of morality and humanness can impact an individual’s ability to fulfil their psychological needs. As such, we concluded that attractive women seeking plastic surgery are potentially subject to experience negative psychosocial outcomes. Future research ought to examine whether perceptions and outcomes differ for women seeking reconstructive plastic surgery (versus cosmetic plastic surgery) and whether they differ across different types of surgeries (i.e. face versus body)."
https://openalex.org/W3197495189,"Current chemotherapy for treatment of pediatric acute leukemia, although generally successful, is still a matter of concern due to treatment resistance, relapses and life-long side effects for a subset of patients. Inhibition of dynamin, a GTPase involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and regulation of the cell cycle, has been proposed as a potential anti-cancer regimen, but the effects of dynamin inhibition on leukemia cells has not been extensively addressed. Here we adopted single cell and whole-population analysis by flow cytometry and live imaging, to assess the effect of dynamin inhibition (Dynasore, Dyngo-4a, MitMAB) on pediatric acute leukemia cell lines (CCRF-CEM and THP-1), human bone marrow biopsies from patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), as well as in a model of lymphoma (EL4)-induced tumor growth in mice. All inhibitors suppressed proliferation and induced pronounced caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death in CCRF-CEM and THP-1 cell lines. However, the inhibitors showed no effect on bone marrow biopsies, and did not prevent EL4-induced tumor formation in mice. We conclude that dynamin inhibition affects highly proliferating human leukemia cells. These findings form a basis for evaluation of the potential, and constraints, of employing dynamin inhibition in treatment strategies against leukemia and other malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W3198452050,"As an essential element, zinc (Zn) can improve or inhibit the growth of plants depending on its concentrations. In this study, the effects of 24-Epibrassinolide (EBR), one well-known steroid phytohormone regulating plant growth and alleviating abiotic stress damage, on morphological parameters and antioxidant capacities of Sedum lineare were investigated under different Zn doses. Compared to plants only exposed to Zn, simultaneously foliar application of 0.75 μM EBR significantly improved multiple morphological characteristics and such growth-improving effects were more significant at high Zn concentrations. At a detrimental 800 μM Zn, EBR benefitted plant growth most prominently, as shown by that the stem length, fresh weight and internode length were increased by 111%, 85% and 157%, respectively; than Zn solely treated plants. EBR spray also enhanced both the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as peroxidase (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), and the contents of antioxidative agents including ascorbic acid (AsA) and glutathione (GSH), which in turn decreased the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alleviated the lipid peroxidation in plants. Thus, by demonstrating that EBR could help S . lineare resist high-zinc stress through strengthening the antioxidant system, this work provided a new idea for expanding the planting range of Crassulaceae plants in heavy metal contaminated soil for phytoremediation purpose in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3198613462,"Climate change represents an unprecedented threat to global biodiversity and, for many species, gaps in our knowledge of their biology remain acute. Gaps in baseline knowledge, such as confirmed identifications (Linnean shortfalls) and adequate collections (Wallacean shortfalls), need to be minimized with new studies, since this is often critical for effective conservation. Despite the increase in scientific research on primates in the southwest of the Brazilian Amazon, little is known about the species Mico nigriceps (Ferrari & Lopes, 1992) Primates, Platirryni. In the current study, we sought to reduce the extent of the Wallacean shortfall for M. nigriceps, understand whether climate change represents a threat to the distribution of the species, and identify priority areas for its conservation. Accordingly, we provide 121 new records in 14 locations, obtained directly from the field, and five from the literature. Using this, we carried out ecological niche modeling, to better understand how environmental suitability might limit the area occupied by the species. We then projected a distribution for 2070 with the SSP2-4.5 (more optimistic) and SSP5-8.5 (more pessimistic) scenarios. Our data confirmed the geographic distribution of the species as being restricted to headwaters of the Ji-Paraná/Machado river, but with a 400 km extension to the south. Under the modeled climate change scenarios, the area suitable for the species declines by 21% under the most optimistic, and by 27% in the pessimistic, scenario across the projected 50-year period. Although we have expanded the area of known occurrence for this species, we point out that climate change threatens the stability of this newly-discovered population strongly, and that this danger is intensified by deforestation, fire and hunting. We recommend that further studies be carried out to confirm the presence of the species in adjacent areas, those indicated by generated models as being potential environmentally suitable. In addition, we recommend intensifying forest restoration in currently pastured areas, and protection of the areas forming the current and future habitat of this species through such measures as protected area creation."
https://openalex.org/W3197478761,"Dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular events can be prevented, or treated, using statins, alone or in combination with ezetimibe. The aim of the study was to compare the direct pleiotropic effects of two commonly-used statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin), ezetimibe and their combinations on endothelial cells damaged by oxidized cholesterol. HUVEC cultures were stimulated for 20 hours with atorvastatin (5 μM; 2793 ng/mL), rosuvastatin (10 μM; 4815 ng/mL), ezetimibe (1.22 μM; 500 ng/mL), atorvastatin plus ezetimibe (5 μM + 1.22 μM; 2793 ng/mL + 500 ng/mL) and rosuvastatin plus ezetimibe (10 μM + 1.22 μM; 4815 ng/mL + 500ng/mL) in separate groups, with or without 25-hydroxycholesterol pre-incubation (24.83 μM; 10 μg/mL; four hours then washout). HUVEC integrity was measured in the RTCA-DP xCELLigence system. The mRNA expression and protein levels of ZO-1, OCLN, ICAM-1 were analyzed by real-time PCR and ELISA. Pre-incubation with 25-OHC resulted in decreased endothelial cell integrity (p<0.001), decreased expression of ZO-1 mRNA (p<0.05) and protein levels (p<0.05), OCLN mRNA (p<0.05) and protein levels (p<0.05) and increased ICAM-1 mRNA (p<0.001) and protein levels (p<0.001) compared to the control group. Incubation with rosuvastatin (12h p<0.01; 24h p<0.001) and atorvastatin (only 12h p<0.05) restored HUVEC integrity. Subsequent incubation with rosuvastatin increased ZO-1 mRNA (p<0.001) and protein (p<0.001) levels. Subsequent addition of ezetimibe increased ZO-1 mRNA level (p<0.001) but not protein level. Furthermore, only incubation with rosuvastatin increased OCLN mRNA (p<0.05) and protein (p<0.05) levels. In each drug-stimulated group, both ICAM-1 mRNA and protein levels were reduced after initial incubation with oxysterol (p<0.05). 25-hydroxycholesterol disrupts endothelial integrity, decreases the mRNA and protein levels of tight junction, and increases those of intercellular adhesion molecules. Both rosuvastatin and atorvastatin can improve endothelial integrity, but only rosuvastatin can completely abolish the effect of oxysterol. The combination of statins with ezetimibe has less direct effect on the endothelial barrier than the statins alone."
https://openalex.org/W3197597234,"Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) is an industrial crop used as a raw material in various fields and is cultivated worldwide. Compared to high potential for its utilization, breeding sector is not vigorous partially due to laborous breeding procedure. Thus, efficient breeding methods are required for varieties that can adapt to various environments and obtain optimal production. For that, identifying kenaf's characteristics is very important during the breeding process. Here, we investigated if RGB based vegetative index (VI) could be associated with traits for biomass. We used 20 varieties and germplasm of kenaf and RGB images taken with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for field selection in early and late growth stage. In addition, measuring the stem diameter and the number of nodes confirmed whether the vegetative index value obtained from the RGB image could infer the actual plant biomass. Based on the results, it was confirmed that the individual surface area and estimated plant height, which were identified from the RGB image, had positive correlations with the stem diameter and node number, which are actual growth indicators of the rate of growth further, biomass could also be estimated based on this. Moreover, it is suggested that VIs have a high correlation with actual growth indicators; thus, the biomass of kenaf could be predicted. Interstingly, those traits showing high correlation in the late stage had very low correlations in the early stage. To sum up, the results in the current study suggest a more efficient breeding method by reducing labor and resources required for breeding selection by the use of RGB image analysis obtained by UAV. This means that considerable high-quality research could be performed even with a tight budget. Furthermore, this method could be applied to crop management, which is done with other vegetative indices using a multispectral camera."
https://openalex.org/W3198141213,"The cardinal symptoms of some ophthalmic diseases observed through exceptional retinal blood vessels, such as retinal vein occlusion, diabetic retinopathy, etc. The advanced deep learning models used to obtain morphological and structural information of blood vessels automatically are conducive to the early treatment and initiative prevention of ophthalmic diseases. In our work, we propose a hierarchical dilation convolutional network (HDC-Net) to extract retinal vessels in a pixel-to-pixel manner. It utilizes the hierarchical dilation convolution (HDC) module to capture the fragile retinal blood vessels usually neglected by other methods. An improved residual dual efficient channel attention (RDECA) module can infer more delicate channel information to reinforce the discriminative capability of the model. The structured Dropblock can help our HDC-Net model to solve the network overfitting effectively. From a holistic perspective, the segmentation results obtained by HDC-Net are superior to other deep learning methods on three acknowledged datasets (DRIVE, CHASE-DB1, STARE), the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, f1-score and AUC score are {0.8252, 0.9829, 0.9692, 0.8239, 0.9871}, {0.8227, 0.9853, 0.9745, 0.8113, 0.9884}, and {0.8369, 0.9866, 0.9751, 0.8385, 0.9913}, respectively. It surpasses most other advanced retinal vessel segmentation models. Qualitative and quantitative analysis demonstrates that HDC-Net can fulfill the task of retinal vessel segmentation efficiently and accurately."
https://openalex.org/W3198898523,"Type 2 diabetes is an important public health issue, yet adherence to drugs and regular clinical follow-up is still suboptimal. This study aims to evaluate a community pharmacy programme for monitoring and enhancing adherence to prescribed pharmacological therapies and recommended examinations among patients with confirmed diabetes.The intervention was conducted in different Italian areas between April 2017 and January 2018. All adult patients who entered a pharmacy with a personal prescription for any antidiabetic drug and agreed to participate, were interviewed. Those found to be non-adherent received counselling from the pharmacists. All patients were invited for a follow-up interview after 3 months.Overall, 930 patients were enrolled and completed the baseline interview. We found low rates of non-adherence, ranging from 8% to 13% for prescribed pharmacological therapies, and 11-29% for the recommended clinical examinations. Non-adherence to oral therapies was higher among younger and recently diagnosed patients; that to clinical examinations was higher in men, those with an intermediate duration of diabetes and less educated patients. Large geographical differences persisted after the adjustment for individual factors. Only 306 patients (32.9%) returned for the follow-up interview, most of whom were already adherent at baseline.Poor adherence to drugs or clinical examinations is not easy to identify in the usual operating setting of community pharmacies. Furthermore, the majority of patients did not return for follow-up, making it impossible to evaluate the efficacy of the pharmacists' counselling. It might be more effective to plan interventions addressed to specific subgroups of patients or areas."
https://openalex.org/W3196407895,"Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the primary cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea, and responsible for over 500,000 enteric infections a year in the United States alone. Although most patients with CDI are successfully treated with metronidazole or vancomycin, the high rate of recurrence is still a serious problem, in which case these antibiotics are usually not very effective. The primary objective of this research is to develop a potentially effective therapeutic agent against C . difficile that are resistant to metronidazole or vancomycin. The susceptibility to metronidazole and vancomycin was examined with 194 C . difficile clinical isolates. Sixty of these isolates chosen based on a variety of criteria were examined for their susceptibility against the 4-chloro-1-piperidin-1ylmethyl-1H-indole-2,3-dione compound (Raja 42), a novel isatin–benzothiazole analogue containing a gamma-lactam structure, as we previously found that this novel compound is effective against a variety of different bacteria. Most of the 60 isolates were resistant to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin, raising the possibility that they might have been exposed previously to these or structurally similar antibiotics (e.g., β-lactam and quinolone compounds). Among the isolates, 48 (80%) and 54 (90%) were susceptible to metronidazole and vancomycin, respectively. Raja 42 was found to be effective against most of the isolates, especially so against metronidazole-resistant C . difficile . Most importantly, five isolates that show resistance to metronidazole and vancomycin were sensitive to Raja 42. Thus, Raja 42, a gamma lactam antibiotic, has the potential to effectively control C . difficile strains that are resistant to metronidazole and vancomycin."

Our study aimed to test the hypothesis that IC/BPS is associated with subsequent increased risks of outpatient visits and hospitalizations. Using nationwide database, the diagnoses were based on the International Classification Codes (ICD-9-CM) (595.1) of at least three outpatient services during 2002-2008, (n = 27,990) and cystoscopic finding Hunner type and/or glomerulation with pre-audit criteria. All recruited cases monitored for subsequent outpatient visits and hospitalizations for 2 years, including all-cause and specialty-specific departments, were classified according to medical specialty and age group (<40, 40-60, ≥60 years of age). IC/BPS patients have more overall outpatient department (OPD) visits and an overall adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 1.64. As for specialty, IRRs were higher in psychiatry (2.75), Chinese medicine (2.01), and emergency medicine (2.00), besides urology and gynecology. The IRRs decreased as age advanced (2.01, 1.71, and 1.44, respectively), except for gynecology (2.42, 2.52, and 2.81). A similar phenomenon happens in hospitalization with IRR of 1.69. Due to claim data characteristics, whether ulcer type IC/BPS findings can be deductive to non-ulcer type remains inclusive. Current results indicate the impacts of healthcare burden in broad spectrum about IC/PBS patients. IC/BPS has been suggested to be associated with lower threshold of healthcare visits and some coexisting disease and is comprised of systemic dysregulation, and is beyond the scope of local bladder-urethra disease. Adequate recognition of associated or comorbid factors and possible recommendation or referral for IC/BPS patients can help provide better healthcare quality."

https://openalex.org/W3197076527,"Sediment transport capacity (Tc) is an essential parameter in the establishment of the slope soil erosion model. Slope type is an important crucial factor affecting sediment transport capacity of overland flow, and vegetation can effectively inhibit soil loss. Two new formulae of sediment transport capacity (Tc) are proposed of brown soil slope and vegetation slope in this study and evaluate the influence of slope gradient (S) and flow discharge (Q) on sediment transport capacity of different slope types. Laboratory experiments conducted using four flow discharges (0.35, 0.45, 0.55, and 0.65 L s-1), four slope gradients (3, 6, 9, and 12°), and two kinds of underlying surface (Brown soil slope, Vegetation slope). The soil particle size range is 0.05-0.5mm. The vegetation stems were 2mm in diameter and randomly arranged. The results show that the sediment transport capacity was positively correlated with the flow discharge and slope gradient. The vegetation slope's average sediment transport capacity is 11.80% higher than the brown soil slope that same discharge and slope gradient conditions. The sensitivity of sediment transport capacity to flow discharge on brown soil slope is higher than that of slope gradient. The sensitivity of sediment transport capacity of vegetation slope to slope gradient is more heightened than flow discharge. The sediment transport capacity was well predicted by discharge and slope gradient on brown soil slope (R2 = 0.982) and vegetation slope (R2 = 0.993). This method is helpful to promote the study of the sediment transport process on overland flow."
https://openalex.org/W3197142406,"Health facilities in developing countries are increasingly adopting Electronic Health Records systems (EHRs) to support healthcare processes. However, only limited studies are available that assess the actual use of the EHRs once adopted in these settings. We assessed the state of the 376 KenyaEMR system (national EHRs) implementations in healthcare facilities offering HIV services in Kenya.The study focused on seven EHRs use indicators. Six of the seven indicators were programmed and packaged into a query script for execution within each KenyaEMR system (KeEMRs) implementation to collect monthly server-log data for each indicator for the period 2012-2019. The indicators included: Staff system use, observations (clinical data volume), data exchange, standardized terminologies, patient identification, and automatic reports. The seventh indicator (EHR variable Completeness) was derived from routine data quality report within the EHRs. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, and multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine how individual facility characteristics affected the use of the system.213 facilities spanning 19 counties participated in the study. The mean number of authorized users who actively used the KeEMRs was 18.1% (SD = 13.1%, p<0.001) across the facilities. On average, the volume of clinical data (observations) captured in the EHRs was 3363 (SD = 4259). Only a few facilities(14.1%) had health data exchange capability. 97.6% of EHRs concept dictionary terms mapped to standardized terminologies such as CIEL. Within the facility EHRs, only 50.5% (SD = 35.4%, p< 0.001) of patients had the nationally-endorsed patient identifier number recorded. Multiple regression analysis indicated the need for improvement on the mode of EHRs use of implementation.The standard EHRs use indicators can effectively measure EHRs use and consequently determine success of the EHRs implementations. The results suggest that most of the EHRs use areas assessed need improvement, especially in relation to active usage of the system and data exchange readiness."
https://openalex.org/W3197603596,"The widespread use of facemasks throughout the population is recommended by the WHO to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. As some regions of the world are facing mask shortages, reuse may be necessary. However, used masks are considered as a potential hazard that may spread and transmit disease if they are not decontaminated correctly and systematically before reuse. As a result, the inappropriate decontamination practices that are commonly witnessed in the general public are challenging management of the epidemic at a large scale. To achieve public acceptance and implementation, decontamination procedures need to be low-cost and simple. We propose the use of hot hygroscopic materials to decontaminate non-medical facemasks in household settings. We report on the inactivation of a viral load on a facial mask exposed to hot hygroscopic materials for 15 minutes. As opposed to recent academic studies whereby decontamination is achieved by maintaining heat and humidity above a given value, a more flexible procedure is proposed here using a slow decaying pattern, which is both effective and easier to implement, suggesting straightforward public deployment and hence reliable implementation by the population."
https://openalex.org/W3198080648,"A novel way of integrating the genetic algorithm (GA) and the analytic network process (ANP) is presented in this paper in order to develop a new warehouse assessment scheme, which is developed through various stages. First, we define the main criteria that influence a warehouse performance. The proposed algorithm that integrates the GA with the ANP is then utilized to determine the relative importance values of the defined criteria and sub-criteria by considering the interrelationships among them, and assign strength values for such interrelationships. Such an algorithm is also employed to linguistically present the relative importance and the strength of the interrelationships in a way that can circumvent the use of pairwise comparisons. Finally, the audit checklist that consists of questions related to the criteria is integrated with the proposed algorithm for the development of the warehouse assessment scheme. Validated on 45 warehouses, the proposed scheme has been shown to be able to identify the warehouse competitive advantages and the areas where more improvements can be achieved."
https://openalex.org/W3198230397,"Paratuberculosis a contagious and chronic disease in domestic and wild ruminants, is caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). Typical clinical signs include intractable diarrhea, progressive emaciation, proliferative enteropathy, and mesenteric lymphadenitis. Paratuberculosis is endemic to many parts of the world and responsible for considerable economic losses. In this study, different types of paratuberculosis and MAP in sheep and goats were investigated in Inner Mongolia, a northern province in China contiguous with two countries and eight other provinces. A total of 4434 serum samples were collected from six cities in the western, central, and eastern regions of Inner Mongolia and analyzed using the ELISA test. In addition, tissue samples were collected from seven animals that were suspected to be infected with MAP. Finally, these tissues samples were analyzed by histopathological examination followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), IS1311 PCR-restriction enzyme analysis (PCR-REA), and a sequence analysis of five genes. Among all 4434 ruminant serum samples collected from the six cities in the western, central, and eastern regions of Inner Mongolia, 7.60% (337/4434) measured positive for the MAP antibody. The proportions of positive MAP antibody results for serum samples collected in the western, central, and eastern regions were 5.10% (105/2058), 6.63% (85/1282), and 13.44% (147/1094), respectively. For the seven suspected infected animals selected from the herd with the highest rate of positivity, the gross pathology and histopathology of the necropsied animals were found to be consistent with the pathological features of paratuberculosis. The PCR analysis further confirmed the diagnosis of paratuberculosis. The rest of the results demonstrated that herds of sheep and goats in Inner Mongolia were infected with both MAP type II and type III. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the two subtypes of MAP strains in sheep and goats in Inner Mongolia."
https://openalex.org/W3198231697,"The p53 protein is expressed as at least twelve protein isoforms. Within intron 4 of the human TP53 gene, a P2 transcription initiation site is located and this transcript encodes two p53 isoforms: Δ133p53 and Δ160p53. Here, the secondary structure of the 5'-terminal region of P2-initiated mRNA was characterized by means of the SHAPE and Pb2+-induced cleavage methods and for the first time, a secondary structure model of this region was proposed. Surprisingly, only Δ133p53 isoform was synthetized in vitro from the P2-initiated p53 mRNA while translation from both initiation codons occurred after the transfection of vector-encoded model mRNA to HCT116 cells. Interestingly, translation performed in the presence of the cap analogue suggested that the cap-independent process contributes to the translation of P2-initiated p53 mRNA. Subsequently, several antisense oligonucleotides targeting the 5'-terminal region of P2-initiated p53 mRNA were designed. The selected oligomers were applied in in vitro translation assays as well as in cell lines and their impact on the Δ133p53 synthesis and on cell viability was investigated. The results show that these oligomers are attractive tools in the modulation of the translation of P2-initiated p53 mRNA through attacking the 5' terminus of the transcript. Since cell proliferation is also reduced by antisense oligomers that lower the level of Δ133p53, this demonstrates an involvement of this isoform in tumorigenesis."

Research focusing on the psychological aspect of human financial behavior and well-being is scarce, focusing more on the cognitive side such as financial literacy and numeracy. The aim of this research study is to find the role played by the non-cognitive factors such as self-esteem, self-control, optimism and deliberative thinking, in forming the financial behavior and financial well-being of the young adults. A sample of 429 university students from public and private sector was collected via an online and field survey using purposive sampling technique. The survey contained measures for demographics, self-esteem, optimism, deliberative thinking, self-control, general financial behavior and financial well-being. SPSS and PLS-SEM tools were used for the exploration of the relationships among dependent and independent variables. The results of PLS path analysis demonstrate that among the non-cognitive factors, self-control and deliberative thinking show a significant association with both financial behavior, and financial security. Self-esteem plays no significant role in forming the financial behavior of the young adults when all the variables are taken together but it exhibits a significant association with financial well-being (financial security and financial anxiety). Optimism on the other hand exhibits no significant association with both financial behavior and financial well-being (financial security and financial anxiety). The results of this study complement the previous studies and also put forth new outcomes. This research is unique as it is the first of its kind conducted in a consumption-oriented economy like Pakistan. In addition to the previous studies which have often established the link of self-esteem with general well-being, this study goes further by analyzing the association between self-esteem and financial well-being and by the identification of the role played by non-cognitive factors like self-esteem, optimism, deliberative thinking and self-control together on the financial behavior and financial well-being of the individuals using PLS-SEM approach."
https://openalex.org/W3198865486,"One of the most contentious topics in cognitive science concerns the impact of bilingualism on cognitive functions and neural resources. Research on executive functions has shown that bilinguals often perform better than monolinguals in tasks that require monitoring and inhibiting automatic responses. The robustness of this effect is a matter of an ongoing debate, with both sides approaching bilingual cognition mainly through measuring abilities that fall outside the core domain of language processing. However, the mental juggling that bilinguals perform daily involves language. This study takes a novel path to bilingual cognition by comparing the performance of monolinguals and bilinguals in a timed task that features a special category of stimulus, which has the peculiar ability to manipulate the cognitive parser into treating it as well-formed while it is not: grammatical illusions. The results reveal that bilinguals outperform monolinguals in detecting illusions, but they are also slower across the board in judging the stimuli, illusory or not. We capture this trade-off by proposing the Plurilingual Adaptive Trade-off Hypothesis (PATH), according to which the adaptation of bilinguals' cognitive abilities may (i) decrease fallibility to illusions by means of recruiting sharpened top-down control processes, but (ii) this is part of a larger bundle of effects, not all of which are necessarily advantageous."

The aim of this study is to analyze the influence of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulation protocols and other clinical factors on LID adequacy. Thyroid cancer patients who underwent LID for RAI scan or treatment were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were guided to have LID for 2 weeks before RAI administration and urine iodine/creatinine ratio (UICR, μg/g Cr) was measured. TSH stimulation was conducted using either thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW) or recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) injection. Adequacy of LID was classified by UICR as 'excellent (< 50)', 'adequate (50-100)', 'inadequate (101-250)' and 'poor (> 250)'. A total of 1715 UICR measurements from 1054 patients were analyzed. UICR was significantly higher in case of rhTSH use than THW (72.4 ± 48.1 vs. 29.9 ± 45.8 μg/g Cr, P < 0.001). In patients who underwent LID twice using both TSH stimulation protocols alternately, UICR was higher in case of rhTSH than THW regardless of the order of method. Among clinical factors, female, old-age, and the first LID were significant factors to show higher UICR. Although the adequacy of LID was 'adequate' or 'excellent' in most patients, multivariate analysis demonstrated that THW method, male, young age, and prior LID-experience were significant determinants for achieving 'excellent' adequacy of LID. In conclusion, UICR was higher and the proportion of 'excellent' LID adequacy was lower with rhTSH than with THW. UICR was higher also in women, old-age, and LID-naïve patients. Further researches are required to suggest effective methods to reduce body iodine pool in case of rhTSH use and to validate the efficacy of such methods on outcomes of RAI treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3196531022,"Introduction Armed conflicts result in greater vulnerability and socioeconomic inequality of populations besides risking their health and well-being. Conflict intensifies the health needs and risks the life and well-being of individuals at large through displacement. Therefore, our study aims to apprise the interventions to which children under-five living in Jordan are especially at risk for acute respiratory infections, diarrhea, and fever in the conflict circumstances. Materials and methods Secondary data analysis is used in the present study. We used a weighted sample of around 9650 children from Jordan Population and Family Health Survey (JPFHS), 2017–18. Bivariate analysis including prevalence rates were used to examine the distribution of socio-demographic characteristics of children. The study has also used multinomial logistic regression model, in order to evaluate the variations in the probability of nationality of under-five children living in Jordan. Results “Syrian nationalist” children have a higher relative risk of ARI (RRR = 1.19, [1.08, 1.32]), and “Other-nationalist” children have two times greater risk of ARI compared to “Jordanian children.” The relative risk of diarrhea is lower among “Syrian nationalist” and “Other-nationalist” children compared to “Jordanian children.” Children belong “Other-nationalist” are found to be less relative risk of fever (RRR = 0.9, [0.80, 1.01]) than “Jordanian children.” Conclusions Our study concludes that conflict-driven displacement has an immediate effect on child health through access, availability, and affordability of health care services, resulting in more significant health care risks. However, sufficient investment is required to address such adversities that affect the health care system due to uneven demand as experienced by the Jordanian health care system. Thus, collaborative efforts through global partners can play a significant role in the countries facing the challenges of managing these health care emergencies."
https://openalex.org/W3196700521,"Due to increasing demand and scarce financial resources for healthcare, health system efficiency has become a major topic in political and scientific debates. While previous studies investigating determinants of health system efficiency focused primarily on economic and social influence factors, the role of the political regime has been neglected. In addition, there is a lack of formal theoretical work on this specific topic, which ensures transparency and logical consistency of arguments and implications. Using a public choice approach, this paper provides a rigorous theoretical and empirical investigation of the relationships between health system efficiency and political institutions. We develop a simple principal-agent model describing the behavior of a government with respect to investments in population health under different political regimes. The main implication of the theoretical model is that governments under more democratic regimes put more effort in reducing embezzlement of health expenditure than non-democratic regimes. Accordingly, democratic countries are predicted to have more efficient health systems than non-democratic countries. We test this hypothesis based on a broad dataset including 158 countries over the period 1995-2015. The empirical results clearly support the implications of the theoretical model and withstand several robustness checks, including the use of alternative indicators for population health and democracy and estimations accounting for endogeneity. The empirical results also indicate that the effect of democracy on health system efficiency is more pronounced in countries with higher income levels. From a policy perspective, we discuss the implications of our findings in the context of health development assistance."
https://openalex.org/W3196925307,"Out of pocket health payment (OOPs) has been identified by the System of Health Accounts (SHA) as the largest source of health care financing in most low and middle-income countries. This means that most low and middle-income countries will rely on user fees and co-payments to generate revenue, rationalize the use of services, contain health systems costs or improve health system efficiency and service quality. However, the accurate measurement of OOPs has been challenged by several limitations which are attributed to both sampling and non-sampling errors when OOPs are estimated from household surveys, the primary source of information in LICs and LMICs. The incorrect measurement of OOP health payments can undermine the credibility of current health spending estimates, an otherwise important indicator for tracking UHC, hence there is the need to address these limitations and improve the measurement of OOPs. In an attempt to improve the measurement of OOPs in surveys, the INDEPTH-Network Household out-of-pocket expenditure project (iHOPE) developed new modules on household health utilization and expenditure by repurposing the existing Ghana Living Standards Survey instrument and validating these new tools with a 'gold standard' (provider data) with the aim of proposing alternative approaches capable of producing reliable data for estimating OOPs in the context of National Health Accounts and for the purpose of monitoring financial protection in health. This paper reports on the challenges and opportunities in using and linking household reported out-of-pocket health expenditures to their corresponding provider records for the purpose of validating household reported out-of-pocket health expenditure in the iHOPE project."
https://openalex.org/W3196927838,"The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a rapidly growing 'infodemic' of health information online. This has motivated the need for accurate semantic search and retrieval of reliable COVID-19 information across millions of documents, in multiple languages. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel high precision and high recall neural Multistage BiCross encoder approach. It is a sequential three-stage ranking pipeline which uses the Okapi BM25 retrieval algorithm and transformer-based bi-encoder and cross-encoder to effectively rank the documents with respect to the given query. We present experimental results from our participation in the Multilingual Information Access (MLIA) shared task on COVID-19 multilingual semantic search. The independently evaluated MLIA results validate our approach and demonstrate that it outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches according to nearly all evaluation metrics in cases of both monolingual and bilingual runs."
https://openalex.org/W3196993926,"In both the pharmaceutical and agricultural fields, RNA-based products have capitalized upon the mechanism of RNA interference for targeted reduction of gene expression to improve phenotypes and traits. Reduction in gene expression by RNAi is the result of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecule binding to an ARGONAUTE (AGO) protein and directing the effector complex to a homologous region of a target gene's mRNA. siRNAs properties that govern RNA-AGO association have been studied in detail. The siRNA 5' nucleotide (nt) identity has been demonstrated in plants to be an important property responsible for directing association of endogenous small RNAs with different AGO effector proteins. However, it has not been investigated whether the 5' nt identity is an efficacious determinant for topically-applied chemically synthesized siRNAs. In this study, we employed a sandpaper abrasion method to study the silencing efficacies of topically-applied 21 base-pair siRNA duplexes. The MAGNESIUM CHELATASE and GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN genes were selected as endogenous and transgenic gene targets, respectively, to assess the molecular and phenotypic effects of gene silencing. Collections of siRNA variants with different 5' nt identities and different pairing states between the 5' antisense nt and its match in the sense strand of the siRNA duplex were tested for their silencing efficacy. Our results suggest a flexibility in the 5' nt requirement for topically applied siRNA duplexes in planta and highlight the similarity of 5' thermodynamic rules governing topical siRNA efficacy across plants and animals."
https://openalex.org/W3198099078,"Fishing trip cost is an important element in evaluating economic performance of fisheries, assessing economic effects from fisheries management alternatives, and serving as input for ecosystem and bioeconomic modeling. However, many fisheries have limited trip-level data due to low observer coverage. This article introduces a generalized linear model (GLM) utilizing machine learning (ML) techniques to develop a modeling approach to estimate the functional forms and predict the fishing trip costs of unsampled trips. GLM with Lasso regularization and ML cross-validation of model are done simultaneously for predictor selection and evaluation of the predictive power of a model. This modeling approach is applied to estimate the trip-level fishing costs using the empirical sampled trip costs and the associated trip-level fishing operational data and vessel characteristics in the Hawaii and American Samoa longline fisheries. Using this approach to build models is particularly important when there is no strong theoretical guideline on predictor selection. Also, the modeling approach addresses the issue of skewed trip cost data and provides predictive power measurement, compared with the previous modeling efforts in trip cost estimation for the Hawaii longline fishery. As a result, fishing trip costs for all trips in the fishery can be estimated. Lastly, this study applies the estimated trip cost model to conduct an empirical analysis to evaluate the impacts on trip costs due to spatial regulations in the Hawaii longline fishery. The results show that closing the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) could induce an average 14% increase in fishing trip costs, while the trip cost impacts of the Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) closures could be lower."
https://openalex.org/W3197667816,"Grounding systems are critical in safeguarding people and equipment from power system failures. A grounding system's principal goal is to offer the lowest impedance path for undesired fault current. Optimization of the grounding grid designs is important in satisfying the minimum cost of the grounding system and safeguarding those people who work in the surrounding area of the grounded installations. Currently, there is no systematic guidance or standard for grounding grid designs that include two-layer soil and its effects on grounding grid systems, particularly vertically layered soil. Furthermore, while numerous studies have been conducted on optimization, relatively limited study has been done on the problem of optimizing the grounding grid in two-layer soil, particularly in vertical soil structures. This paper presents the results of optimization for substation grounding systems using the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm in different soil conditions which conforms to the safety requirements of the grounding system. Practical features of grounding grids in various soil conditions discussed in this paper (uniform soil, two-layer horizontal soil, and two-layer vertical soil) are considered during problem formulation and solution algorithm. The proposed algorithm's results show that the number of grid conductors in the X and Y directions (Nx and Ny), as well as vertical rods (Nr), can be optimized from initial numbers of 35% for uniform soil, 57% for horizontal two-layer soil for ρ1> ρ2, and 33% for horizontal two-layer soil for ρ1< ρ2, and 29% for vertical two-layer soil structure. In other words, the proposed technique would be able to utilize square and rectangle-shaped grounding grids with a number of grid conductors and vertical rods to be implemented in uniform, two-layer horizontal and vertical soil structure, depending on the resistivity of the soil layer."
https://openalex.org/W3198273416,"Objectives The chick is rapidly becoming a standardized preclinical model in vision research to study mechanisms of ocular disease. We seek to comprehensively evaluate the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) model of excitotoxic retinal damage using multimodal imaging, functional, and histologic approaches in NMDA-damaged, vehicle-treated, and undamaged chicks. Methods Chicks were either left undamaged in both eyes or were injected with NMDA in the left eye and saline (vehicle) in the right eye. TUNEL assay was performed on chicks to assess levels of retinal cell death one day post-injection of NMDA or saline and on age-matched untreated chicks. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was performed weekly on chicks and age-matched controls day 1 (D1) up to D28 post-injection. Light adapted electroretinograms (ERG) were performed alongside SD-OCT measurements on post-injection chicks along with age-matched untreated controls. Results Untreated and vehicle-treated eyes had no TUNEL positive cells while NMDA-treated eyes accumulated large numbers of TUNEL positive cells in the Inner Nuclear Layer (INL), but not other layers, at D1 post injection. Significant inner retina swelling or edema was found on SD-OCT imaging at D1 post-injection which resolved at subsequent timepoints. Both the INL and the inner plexiform layer significantly thinned by one-week post-injection and did not recover for the duration of the measurements. On ERG, NMDA-treated eyes had significantly reduced amplitudes of all parameters at D1 with all metrics improving over time. The b-wave, oscillatory potentials, and ON/OFF bipolar responses were the most affected with at least 70% reduction immediately after damage compared to the fellow eye control. Conclusion This study establishes a normative baseline on the retinal health and gross functional ability as well as intraocular pressures of undamaged, vehicle-treated, and NMDA-damaged chicks to provide a standard for comparing therapeutic treatment studies in this important animal model."
https://openalex.org/W3198413071,"Most small renal cell carcinomas (small RCCs) will remain indolent after detection, but some stage I RCCs still metastasize. There are no risk-stratification imaging factors that could be used to identify poor-prognosis patients based on genomic profiling. Here, we evaluated the relationships between imaging parameters and RNA expressions in small RCC and attempted to identify imaging factors that could be used as effective biomarkers.We acquired biopsy specimens of 18 clear cell carcinomas that had undergone perfusion CT (pCT) and MRI between April 2018 and March 2019. We performed RNA sequencing, assessed RNA expressions, and calculated each tumor's cell-cycle progression (CCP) score, which has prognostic value in predicting metastatic progression. We classified the tumors into two groups: clear cell type A (ccA) and type B (ccB). CcA has better survival compared to ccB. We evaluated the following characteristics of each tumor: tumor size, presence of pseudocapsule, and fat. We used the pCT and MRI to measure each tumor's volume transfer constant (Ktrans), rate constant (Kep), extracellular extravascular volume fraction (VE), fractional plasma volume (VP), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). The correlations between these small RCC imaging parameters and the tumor size and RNA expressions were determined.The tumor size was significantly correlated with Kep and inversely correlated with VE, VP, ADC, and hallmark angiogenesis. The CCP score was significantly inversely correlated with Ktrans and Kep. The ccA tumors tended to show a pseudocapsule on MRI.Tumor size was correlated with low perfusion, but not with prognostic factors based on genomic profiling. Imaging parameters (e.g., Ktrans and Kep) and tumor characteristics (e.g., pseudocapsule) may enable gene-based risk stratification in small RCC."
