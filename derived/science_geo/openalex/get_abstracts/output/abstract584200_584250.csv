https://openalex.org/W2607177050,"The authors show that during sleep, dreaming and specific perceptual dream contents can be localized to a posterior hot zone of the brain. By monitoring activity in this zone, they were able to predict dreaming in real time with high accuracy. Consciousness never fades during waking. However, when awakened from sleep, we sometimes recall dreams and sometimes recall no experiences. Traditionally, dreaming has been identified with rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep, characterized by wake-like, globally 'activated', high-frequency electroencephalographic activity. However, dreaming also occurs in non-REM (NREM) sleep, characterized by prominent low-frequency activity. This challenges our understanding of the neural correlates of conscious experiences in sleep. Using high-density electroencephalography, we contrasted the presence and absence of dreaming in NREM and REM sleep. In both NREM and REM sleep, reports of dream experience were associated with local decreases in low-frequency activity in posterior cortical regions. High-frequency activity in these regions correlated with specific dream contents. Monitoring this posterior 'hot zone' in real time predicted whether an individual reported dreaming or the absence of dream experiences during NREM sleep, suggesting that it may constitute a core correlate of conscious experiences in sleep."

The clarity of these patterns motivated the use of specific activity pattern shapes to classify entorhinal cell types. While this approach successfully revealed cells that encode boundaries, head direction, and running speed, it left a majority of cells unclassified, and its pre-defined nature may have missed unconventional, yet important coding properties. Here, we apply an unbiased statistical approach to search for cells that encode navigationally relevant variables. This approach successfully classifies the majority of entorhinal cells and reveals unsuspected entorhinal coding principles. First, we find a high degree of mixed selectivity and heterogeneity in superficial entorhinal neurons. Second, we discover a dynamic and remarkably adaptive code for space that enables entorhinal cells to rapidly encode navigational information accurately at high running speeds. Combined, these observations advance our current understanding of the mechanistic origins and functional implications of the entorhinal code for navigation. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2607419807,"Cognitive representation of the environment requires a stable hippocampal map, but the mechanisms maintaining a given map are unknown. Because sharp wave-ripples (SPW-R) orchestrate both retrospective and prospective spatial information, we hypothesized that disrupting neuronal activity during SPW-Rs affects spatial representation. Mice learned new sets of three goal locations daily in a multiwell maze. We used closed-loop SPW-R detection at goal locations to trigger optogenetic silencing of a subset of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Control place cells (nonsilenced or silenced outside SPW-Rs) largely maintained the location of their place fields after learning and showed increased spatial information content. In contrast, the place fields of SPW-R-silenced place cells remapped, and their spatial information remained unaltered. SPW-R silencing did not impact the firing rates or proportions of place cells. These results suggest that interference with SPW-R-associated activity during learning prevents stabilization and refinement of hippocampal maps."

The aim of this study was to examine whether different types of social participation are associated with changes in psychological distress level in older men and women in Japan.Two thousand seven hundred community-dwelling older adults (aged 65-74 years, 50% women) were randomly selected from the resident registry of three cities. Of these, participants who reported social participation and psychological distress level in the baseline survey in 2010 were followed up. Psychological distress was evaluated based on K6 scales at baseline and follow-up (in 2015). Social participation level was examined using question items from the National Health and Nutrition Survey in Japan. Exploratory factor analysis was used to derive the underlying factor structure. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine the association between social participation and changes in psychological distress level after adjusting for covariates stratified by both gender and age group or living arrangement.Data from 825 community-dwelling older adults (45.3% women) were analyzed. Social participation was categorized into two types using factor analysis: community involvement (volunteer activities, community events, clubs for the elderly) and individual relationship (friendship, communication with family and friends, hobbies). During the 5-year follow-up, 29.5% of participants reported a deterioration in psychological distress. Higher community involvement was independently associated with lower risk of psychological distress for older women (β = 0.099, p = 0.047), whereas there were no associations with individual relationship for either gender. Furthermore, in older women living with others, higher community involvement was also associated with lower risk of psychological distress (β = 0.110, p = 0.048).Community involvement provides older women with mental health benefits regardless of individual relationship level. Promoting community involvement may be an effective strategy for healthy mental aging."
https://openalex.org/W2604702222,"Brucellosis, a worldwide common bacterial zoonotic disease, has become quite rare in Northern and Western Europe. However, since 2014 a significant increase of imported infections caused by Brucella (B.) melitensis has been noticed in Germany. Patients predominantly originated from Middle East including Turkey and Syria. These circumstances afforded an opportunity to gain insights into the population structure of Brucella strains. Brucella-isolates from 57 patients were recovered between January 2014 and June 2016 with culture confirmed brucellosis by the National Consultant Laboratory for Brucella. Their whole genome sequences were generated using the Illumina MiSeq platform. A whole genome-based SNP typing assay was developed in order to resolve geographically attributed genetic clusters. Results were compared to MLVA typing results, the current gold-standard of Brucella typing. In addition, sequences were examined for possible genetic variation within target regions of molecular diagnostic assays. Phylogenetic analyses revealed spatial clustering and distinguished strains from different patients in either case, whereas multiple isolates from a single patient or technical replicates showed identical SNP and MLVA profiles. By including WGS data from the NCBI database, five major genotypes were identified. Notably, strains originating from Turkey showed a high diversity and grouped into seven subclusters of genotype II. MLVA analysis congruently clustered all isolates and predominantly matched the East Mediterranean genetic clade. This study confirms whole-genome based SNP-analysis as a powerful tool for accurate typing of B. melitensis. Furthermore it allows special allocation and therefore provides useful information on the geographic origin for trace-back analysis. However, the lack of reliable metadata in public databases often prevents a resolution below geographic regions or country levels and corresponding precise trace-back analysis. Once this obstacle is resolved, WGS-derived bacterial typing adds an important method to complement epidemiological surveys during outbreak investigations. This is the first report of a detailed genetic investigation of an extensive collection of B. melitensis strains isolated from human cases in Germany."

The lack of information about the signaling pathways that sustain fibrosis and the myofibroblast phenotype has prevented the development of targeted therapies for IPF. Our previous study showed that isolated fibrogenic lung fibroblasts have high endogenous levels of the hyaluronan receptor, CD44V6 (CD44 variant containing exon 6), which enhances the TGFβ1 autocrine signaling and induces fibroblasts to transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts. NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) enzyme, which catalyzes the reduction of O2 to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), has been implicated in the cardiac and lung myofibroblast phenotype. However, whether CD44V6 regulates NOX4 to mediate tissue repair and fibrogenesis is not well-defined. The present study assessed the mechanism of how TGF-β-1-induced CD44V6 regulates the NOX4/reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling that mediates the myofibroblast differentiation. Specifically, we found that NOX4/ROS regulates hyaluronan synthesis and the transcription of CD44V6 via an effect upon AP-1 activity. Further, CD44V6 is part of a positive-feedback loop with TGFβ1/TGFβRI signaling that acts to increase NOX4/ROS production, which is required for myofibroblast differentiation, myofibroblast differentiation, myofibroblast extracellular matrix production, myofibroblast invasion, and myofibroblast contractility. Both NOX4 and CD44v6 are up-regulated in the lungs of mice subjected to experimental lung injury and in cases of human IPF. Genetic (CD44v6 shRNA) or a small molecule inhibitor (CD44v6 peptide) targeting of CD44v6 abrogates fibrogenesis in murine models of lung injury. These studies support a function for CD44V6 in lung fibrosis and offer proof of concept for therapeutic targeting of CD44V6 in lung fibrosis disorders.

These multisubunit protein complexes consist of five subunits: a membrane-associated cytochrome b558 containing gp91phox and p22phox and a cytosolic complex of p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox. The family of human NOX proteins consists of five members (NOX1- to -5) and two related dual oxidases (DUOX1 and -2). NOX1, NOX2, and NOX3 show a high degree of homology and require p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox subunits and activation by Rac protein. In addition, the p22phox subunit is important for the stability and functioning of NOX1 to NOX4 (9.Lambeth J.D. NOX enzymes and the biology of reactive oxygen.Nat. Rev.

Fibrosis is caused by unrestrained wound-healing responses during tissue repair in pathological conditions, including IPF (17.Ghosh A.K. Quaggin S.E. Vaughan D.E. Molecular basis of organ fibrosis: potential therapeutic approaches.Exp. Biol. Med. 2013; 238: 461-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). During wound repair, both fibroblasts and myofibroblasts invade the wound and synthesize a variety of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) in the fibrotic tissue (18.Hunt T.K. Knighton D.R. Thakral K.K. Goodson 3rd, W.H. Andrews W.S.

Med. 2011; 208: 1459-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). At sites of tissue damage and wound healing, fibroblasts with a contractile phenotype are essential for the synthesis of the collagen-rich scar and for providing the force for wound contraction (20.Grinnell F. Fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and wound contraction.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fibrotic scars are characterized by accumulation of contractile matrix proteins produced by differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, which can then compromise normal tissue functions. One of the major profibrotic cytokines involved in fibrogenesis is TGFβ1, as shown in the pathogenesis of IPF (21.Munger J.S. Huang X. Kawakatsu H. Griffiths M.J. Dalton S.L. Wu J. Pittet J.F.

In addition to the direct effect of TGFβ1 on ECM turnover, it can drive fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation and activation, which is associated with disease pathologies (2.Thannickal V.J.

In fibrogenic circumstances, the myofibroblasts comprise the crucial cell population (2.Thannickal V.J. Mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis: role of activated myofibroblasts and NADPH oxidase.Fibrogenesis Tissue Repair. 2012; 5: S23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to wound healing, however, a persistent accumulation of myofibroblasts is associated with the pathological reorganization and expansion of ECM components that may not normally be present or are present at only low levels in normal tissue (28.Desmoulière A. Factors influencing myofibroblast differentiation during wound healing and fibrosis.Cell Biol. Int. 1995; 19: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). One of the earliest fibrogenic responses is the deposition of HA in the pericellular matrix surrounding the differentiated cells (29.Li Y. Rahmanian M. Widström C. Lepperdinger G. Frost G.I.

HA is synthesized by HA synthase enzymes, of which three distinct genes have been isolated and characterized, HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3 (33.Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Characterization and molecular evolution of a vertebrate hyaluronan synthase gene family.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1923-1932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). HA turnover occurs under normal physiologic settings, and the increase in HA levels during pathologic conditions reveals the balance between its synthesis and catabolism. Hyaluronidases are enzymes that degrade HA, and two distinct hyaluronidase genes (HYAL1 and HYAL2) have been reported to be involved in the intracellular and extracellular catabolism of HA in a CD44-dependent manner (34.Harada H. Takahashi M. CD44-dependent intracellular and extracellular catabolism of hyaluronic acid by hyaluronidase-1 and -2.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5597-5607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). It has been shown that lung tissue from human IPF patients and from mice in which lung fibrosis was induced by bleomycin share a potentially important clue as to the cause of fibrosis, the overexpression of Has2 (hyaluronan synthase 2) by myofibroblasts, the enzyme that can synthesize HA (19.Li Y. Jiang D. Liang J. Meltzer E.B. Gray A. Miura R. Wogensen L. Yamaguchi Y. Noble P.W. Severe lung fibrosis requires an invasive fibroblast phenotype regulated by hyaluronan and CD44.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 1459-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). A recent study also provides evidence that deletion of Has2 in mouse mesenchymal cells increased the cellular senescence of fibroblasts in bleomycin-induced mouse lung injury (35.Li Y. Liang J. Yang T. Monterrosa Mena J. Huan C. Xie T. Kurkciyan A. Liu N. Jiang D. Noble P.W. Hyaluronan synthase 2 regulates fibroblast senescence in pulmonary fibrosis.Matrix Biol. 2016; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matbio.2016.03.004Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The authors also suggest that targeting Has2 to induce fibroblast senescence could be an attractive approach to resolve tissue fibrosis (35.Li Y. Liang J. Yang T. Monterrosa Mena J. Huan C. Xie T. Kurkciyan A. Liu N. Jiang D. Noble P.W. Hyaluronan synthase 2 regulates fibroblast senescence in pulmonary fibrosis.Matrix Biol. 2016; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matbio.2016.03.004Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). On the other hand, studies also show that senescent human fibroblasts also resist apoptosis caused by growth factor deprivation and oxidative stress, indicating that resistance to apoptosis might partly explain why senescent and apoptosis-resistant myofibroblasts are highly stable in culture and induce persistent fibrosis in lungs of aged mice (6.Hecker L.

Myofibroblast apoptosis is crucial to the regression of fibrotic scars and the regeneration of healthy tissue during wound repair and may be aberrant in diseases such as IPF. It is now recognized that myofibroblasts have several origins, contribute significantly to connective tissue remodeling by exerting contractile forces and producing ECM components, regress and disappear by apoptosis on wound epithelialization, and may persist in fibrotic situations and cause organ dysfunction (38.Hinz B.

Because deficiency of sodium leak channel, non-selective (Nalcn) causes lethal apnea in humans and mice, we investigated Nalcn function in these neuronal groups. We found that one-third of mice lacking Nalcn in excitatory preBötC neurons died soon after birth; surviving mice developed apneas in adulthood.

These findings reveal Nalcn’s specific role in both rhythmic stability and responsiveness to neuropeptides within the respiratory network. Rhythmicity governs many biological functions, on scales ranging from subseconds to months, during both waking and sleeping states. These rhythms must strike a balance between a regular, intrinsic pattern and the ability to respond to changing environmental and physiological conditions. In the case of respiration, neurons in the preBötzinger complex (preBötC) show characteristics of a central pattern generator (CPG) that generates inspiratory movements and is coupled with chemosensory neurons, such as the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) (Feldman et al., 2013Feldman J.L.

Pre-Bötzinger complex: a brainstem region that may generate respiratory rhythm in mammals.Science. 1991; 254: 726-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). Specifically, the glutamatergic subpopulation of preBötC neurons generates the inspiratory rhythms essential for breathing (Wang et al., 2014Wang X. Hayes J.A. Revill A.L. Song H. Kottick A. Vann N.C. LaMar M.D. Picardo M.C. Akins V.T. Funk G.D. Del Negro C.A. Laser ablation of Dbx1 neurons in the pre-Bötzinger complex stops inspiratory rhythm and impairs output in neonatal mice.eLife. 2014; 3: e03427Google Scholar), while the RTN neurons (all of which are glutamatergic) provide rhythmic excitatory drive to the preBötC during early development and during active expiration upon physical exercise (Pagliardini et al., 2011Pagliardini S. Janczewski W.A. Tan W. Dickson C.T. Deisseroth K. Feldman J.L. Active expiration induced by excitation of ventral medulla in adult anesthetized rats.J.

Importantly, neurons within the preBötC and RTN are intrinsically active but must also respond to neuromodulatory inputs. For example, subsets of chemosensitive serotonergic neurons within the ventral lateral medulla innervate the RTN and preBötC regions and increase respiratory activity by releasing neuromodulators, such as substance P and serotonin (Mulkey et al., 2007Mulkey D.K. Rosin D.L. West G. Takakura A.C. Moreira T.S. Bayliss D.A. Guyenet P.G. Serotonergic neurons activate chemosensitive retrotrapezoid nucleus neurons by a pH-independent mechanism.J.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 3720-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The substance P receptor neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) is coupled with voltage-independent cation channels to increase neuronal excitability (Hayes and Del Negro, 2007Hayes J.A. Del Negro C.A.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 3720-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). What remains unclear, however, is how the network activity and exogenous inputs are coordinated into a properly responsive respiratory response. We were interested in identifying ion channels that might participate in rhythm generation, chemosensitivity, or substance P modulation and decided to investigate the nonselective cation channel sodium leak channel, non-selective (Nalcn). In humans, NALCN mutations show severe respiratory dysfunction (Chong et al., 2015Chong J.X. McMillin M.J. Shively K.M. Beck A.E. Marvin C.T. Armenteros J.R. Buckingham K.J. Nkinsi N.T. Boyle E.A.

Genet. 2016; 59: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In mice, Nalcn deletion causes periodic apnea, depressed respiratory rhythm, and death within the first postnatal day (P0) (Lu et al., 2007Lu B. Su Y. Das S. Liu J. Xia J. Ren D.

Given that previous pharmacological studies had shown that neurons within the preBötC and RTN express the persistent Na+ current (INaP) and the HCN-mediated inward current (Ih) (Del Negro et al., 2002Del Negro C.A.

To delete Nalcn in specific cells, we first generated mice carrying the loxP-flanked (floxed) Nalcn allele (Nalcnflox, Figure S1A). Cre-mediated recombination deletes exons 5 and 6 and introduces a stop codon, leaving the Nalcn transcript undetectable, as confirmed by in situ hybridization and RT-PCR (Figures S1B and S1C). We verified that the respiratory phenotype of Nalcn null mice originates from the nervous system by deleting Nalcn using a NestinCre allele (NalcnNestinCKO) (Tronche et al., 1999Tronche F. Kellendonk C. Kretz O. Gass P. Anlag K. Orban P.C. Bock R. Klein R. Schütz G. Disruption of the glucocorticoid receptor gene in the nervous system results in reduced anxiety.Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). All of the NalcnNestinCKO mice died within 24 hr of birth (Table 1), mimicking the phenotype of Nalcn null animals. This indicates that Nalcn current in the nervous system is essential for neonatal survival.Table 1Neonatal Lethality in Different Nalcn Conditional Knockout MiceAbbreviations: CNS, central nervous system; RTN, retrotrapezoid nucleus; preBötC, preBötzinger complex. Open table in a new tab Abbreviations: CNS, central nervous system; RTN, retrotrapezoid nucleus; preBötC, preBötzinger complex. The respiratory network relies on several neurotransmitters, including glutamate, GABA, serotonin, glycine, and acetylcholine (Feldman et al., 2013Feldman J.L. Del Negro C.A. Gray P.A.

Although 13.2% of NalcnViaatCKO mice died within 24 hr of birth, none of the NalcnChatCKO, NalcnPet1CKO, or NalcnGlyT2CKO mice died (Table 1). On the other hand, all NalcnVglut2CKO mice died within 24 hr of birth (Table 1). Therefore, we focused on the glutamatergic preBötC and RTN neurons in the brainstem. The conductance and regulation of the Nalcn cation complex depend on the pore-forming subunit (Nalcn itself) and at least two interactors: Unc79 and Unc80 (Lu et al., 2009Lu B. Su Y. Das S. Wang H.

We detected co-localization of Nalcn, Unc79, and Unc80 transcripts in the tdTomato-labeled RTN using Atonal homolog-1Cre (Atoh1Cre) (Yang et al., 2010Yang H. Xie X. Deng M. Chen X. Gan L.

This suggests that the RTN co-expresses components of a functional Nalcn complex. The paired-like homeobox 2b (Phox2b)-expressing progenitors in the embryonic hindbrain give rise to the glutamatergic RTN neurons (Dubreuil et al., 2009Dubreuil V. Thoby-Brisson M. Rallu M.

Within the preBötC region, respiratory glutamatergic neurons derive from progenitors expressing Dbx1 and are critical for respiratory rhythm generation and motor output (Bouvier et al., 2010Bouvier J.

Laser ablation of Dbx1 neurons in the pre-Bötzinger complex stops inspiratory rhythm and impairs output in neonatal mice.eLife. 2014; 3: e03427Google Scholar). Thus, we deleted Nalcn in glutamatergic preBötC neurons using the Dbx1Cre line (NalcnDbx1CKO) and in the RTN using either Phox2bCre (NalcnPhox2bCKO) (Scott et al., 2011Scott M.M. Williams K.W. Rossi J. Lee C.E. Elmquist J.K. Leptin receptor expression in hindbrain Glp-1 neurons regulates food intake and energy balance in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 2413-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) or Atoh1Cre (NalcnAtoh1CKO) lines. To our surprise, none of the NalcnPhox2bCKO or NalcnAtoh1CKO newborns showed neonatal lethality (Table 1), but 32.6% of the NalcnDbx1CKO mice died within 24 hr of birth (Table 1). We performed neonatal head-out pneumotachography to determine whether the perinatal death of NalcnDbx1CKO mice was due to respiratory deficits. 28.6% of the NalcnDbx1CKO newborns (Figure 1A, green) showed a significantly greater frequency of apnea than the other newborns, consistent with the lethality rate. One possible explanation for the survival of the NalcnDbx1CKO newborns is the excitatory drive from the RTN neurons (Jacquin et al., 1996Jacquin T.D. Borday V. Schneider-Maunoury S. Topilko P. Ghilini G. Kato F. Charnay P. Champagnat J. Reorganization of pontine rhythmogenic neuronal networks in Krox-20 knockout mice.Neuron. 1996; 17: 747-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, deleting Nalcn from the preBötC and RTN (NalcnDCKO) does not cause additional lethality in mice (Table 1), suggesting that the surviving NalcnDbx1CKO newborns might receive compensatory respiratory activity from other Vglut2+ neurons. To determine whether loss of Nalcn in the RTN or preBötC affects the responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia in freely moving adult animals, we used unrestrained whole-body plethysmography (UWBP) to monitor the respiration of 7-week-old NalcnPhox2bCKO, NalcnAtoh1CKO, and NalcnDbx1CKO mice. The respiratory rate during exposure to fresh air, hypercapnic (5% CO2), or hypoxic (10% O2) conditions was indistinguishable among NalcnPhox2bCKO (data not shown), NalcnAtoh1CKO, NalcnDbx1CKO, and control mice, but NalcnDbx1CKO mice had longer inspiratory time (Figure S3A), suggesting that removing Nalcn from the RTN and preBötC did not impair breathing frequency or chemoreflexes, while loss of Nalcn in the preBötC led to disturbed respiratory patterns in vivo. Interestingly, NalcnAtoh1CKO and NalcnDbx1CKO, but not NalcnPhox2bCKO, mice showed increased apnea frequency compared to heterozygous and Nalcnflox/flox groups (Figures 1B–1D; Figures S3A–S3C). Blood gas measurements showed no difference in blood CO2 levels (Table S1), ruling out disturbance of systematic CO2 homeostasis. To determine whether the apnea in NalcnAtoh1CKO mice was due to the lack of Nalcn expression in Atoh1+ neurons within the pons, we deleted Nalcn using En1Cre (NalcnEn1CKO) (Kimmel et al., 2000Kimmel R.A. Turnbull D.H. Blanquet V. Wurst W. Loomis C.A. Joyner A.L. Two lineage boundaries coordinate vertebrate apical ectodermal ridge formation.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1377-1389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NalcnEn1CKO mice survived at birth (Table 1) but showed a significantly greater frequency of apnea at 7 weeks (Figure 1E; Figure S3A). These results indicate that preBötC neurons and Atoh1-dependent neurons, likely from the rhombic lip lineages in the pons, require Nalcn to maintain proper respiration. Furthermore, the expression of Nalcn in the preBötC is critical for neonatal respiration. To determine whether Nalcn is important for the biophysical activities of the RTN and preBötC networks, we used the patch-clamp technique to assess the biophysical properties of labeled RTN and preBötC network from which we had deleted Nalcn using a fluorescent reporter (RosaLSL-tdTomato) (Madisen et al., 2010Madisen L. Zwingman T.A. Sunkin S.M. Oh S.W. Zariwala H.A. Gu H. Ng L.L. Palmiter R.D. Hawrylycz M.J. Jones A.R. et al.A robust and high-throughput Cre reporting and characterization system for the whole mouse brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3847) Google Scholar) (Figures 2A and 2B ). We compared NalcnAtoh1CKO and NalcnDbx1CKO mice to Nalcn heterozygous littermates based on the mating strategy (Atoh1Cre; Nalcnflox/+ × Nalcnflox/flox; RosaLSL-tdTomato/LSL-tdTomato and Dbx1Cre; Nalcnflox/+ × Nalcnflox/flox; RosaLSL-tdTomato/LSL-tdTomato). RTN neurons lacking Nalcn showed hyperpolarized resting membrane potential (Figure 2C; Table S2A), a 49% reduction in spontaneous spike frequency (Figures 2D–2E; Table S2A), and a 39% and 23% increase in input resistance and holding current, respectively (Table S2A). Similarly, preBötC neurons lacking Nalcn had a hyperpolarized resting membrane potential (Figure 2F; Table S2B), a 38% reduction in inspiratory neuronal bursting frequency (Figures 2G–2H; Table S2B), a 20% decrease in capacitance, and a 24% and 21% increase in input resistance and holding current, respectively (Table S2B). There was a 47% reduction in network rhythmicity (Figures 2G′–2H′; Table S2B). We also measured the steady-state current-voltage (I-V) relationship from the labeled RTN and preBötC neurons, and loss of Nalcn resulted in lower inward current in both populations compared with control cells (Figures 2I and 2J), consistent with previous observations in the hippocampal and the RTN neurons (Lu et al., 2007Lu B.

Nalcn is a “leak” sodium channel that regulates excitability of brainstem chemosensory neurons and breathing.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 8174-8187Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The Nalcn current clearly contributes to the resting membrane potential and the rhythmic activity of the RTN and preBötC neurons. Substance P has been shown to enhance both RTN firing frequency and the resulting respiratory motor outputs (Mulkey et al., 2007Mulkey D.K. Rosin D.L. West G. Takakura A.C. Moreira T.S. Bayliss D.A. Guyenet P.G. Serotonergic neurons activate chemosensitive retrotrapezoid nucleus neurons by a pH-independent mechanism.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 14128-14138Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the hippocampus and ventral tegmental areas, substance P binds to NK1R and mediates slow excitation by activating the Nalcn complex (Lu et al., 2009Lu B. Su Y. Das S. Wang H. Wang Y. Liu J. Ren D. Peptide neurotransmitters activate a cation channel complex of NALCN and UNC-80.Nature. 2009; 457: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To determine whether substance P-mediated slow excitation in the RTN network is Nalcn dependent, we applied substance P to brainstem slices containing the RTN. Upon loss of Nalcn, the RTN showed a diminished response to substance P (Figures 2D and 2E; Table S2A); this is consistent with a recent report that Nalcn contributes to the substance P-mediated membrane conductance in the RTN network (Shi et al., 2016Shi Y. Abe C. Holloway B.B. Shu S. Kumar N.N. Weaver J.L. Sen J. Perez-Reyes E. Stornetta R.L. Guyenet P.G. Bayliss D.A. Nalcn is a “leak” sodium channel that regulates excitability of brainstem chemosensory neurons and breathing.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 8174-8187Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It was previously shown that a substance P-mediated, tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant, low-threshold sodium current modulates neuronal excitability of the preBötC (Hayes and Del Negro, 2007Hayes J.A. Del Negro C.A. Neurokinin receptor-expressing pre-botzinger complex neurons in neonatal mice studied in vitro.J.

Substance P-mediated modulation of pacemaker properties in the mammalian respiratory network.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7549-7556Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We found that deleting Nalcn from glutamatergic preBötC neurons reduced neuronal modulatory response to substance P and lowered bursting frequency compared to control neurons (Figures 2G and 2H; Table S2B), as well as network response to substance P (Figures 2G′–2H′; Table S2B). The I-V curve showed that substance P induced inward current in control neurons and reduced inward current in preBötC neurons lacking Nalcn, but not in the RTN lacking Nalcn (Figures 2I and 2J), potentially explaining prior data from cultured hippocampal cells and slices containing the preBötC (Hayes and Del Negro, 2007Hayes J.A. Del Negro C.A. Neurokinin receptor-expressing pre-botzinger complex neurons in neonatal mice studied in vitro.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 4215-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, Lu et al., 2009Lu B. Su Y. Das S. Wang H. Wang Y. Liu J. Ren D. Peptide neurotransmitters activate a cation channel complex of NALCN and UNC-80.Nature. 2009; 457: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, although Nalcn is important for the resting membrane potential, firing frequency, and modulatory response to substance P, mice without Nalcn in RTN neurons are still able to sustain regular breathing. In the preBötC neurons, however, Nalcn current is critical for excitability, network stability, and modulatory response of substance P, as well as regular in vivo respiration. Given that we performed the UWBP during the daytime and found apneas while the animals were at rest (Figures 1B and 1C), we hypothesized that the apneas also happened while the animals were asleep. Therefore, we performed UWBP from Nalcnflox/flox, Atoh1Cre; Nalcnflox/+, NalcnAtoh1CKO, Dbx1Cre; Nalcnflox/+, and NalcnDbx1CKO mice while recording electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) to categorize the apnea frequency in different states of brain activity (Figures 3A–3D). Compared to control mice, NalcnDbx1CKO mice showed a much greater frequency of apnea during active wake, quiet wake, and both non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) and rapid eye movement (REM) stages of sleep (Figure 3E; Figure S4A). Similarly, NalcnAtoh1CKO mice had higher frequency of apnea in active wake, quiet wake, and non-REM stages (Figure 3F; Figure S4B). Moreover, NalcnDbx1CKO mice showed longer apnea duration in quiescence or in sleep (Figure S4C, left), unlike NalcnAtoh1CKO mice (Figure S4C, right). The results indicate that Atoh1-dependent neurons and preBötC neurons require Nalcn to maintain regular breathing, likely because of reduction in the excitability of the respiratory center. Nalcn is a nonselective cation channel that contributes to the ma"

Correct identification of intraplaque neovascularization by contrast–enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) may provide an additional risk marker in carotid stenosis. This pilot study investigates the correlation between histological evaluation of carotid plaque specimens and pre-surgery CEUS to identify neovascularization. Methods 17 patients with high-grade internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis were studied. CEUS was performed in all patients shortly before carotid endarterectomy. Neovascularization, infiltration of T cells and macrophages along with intraplaque hemorrhage were studied in excised plaques by immunohistochemistry. Ultrasound-based four-level and two-level classification systems for neovascularization were used. CEUS findings were compared with histological findings. Results Scores on the CEUS-based four-level and two-level classifications were robustly correlated with the density of intraplaque vessels (r = 0.635, p = 0.006 and r = 0.578, p = 0.015, respectively). Histological evaluation of regions with strong and prolonged intraplaque enhancement typically showed strong intraplaque neovascularization in conjunction with acute intraplaque hemorrhage. Moreover, higher grades of intraplaque neovascularization as determined by ultrasound were associated with a higher percentage of macrophage-rich areas. Conclusion CEUS is a technique well suited to gauge the degree of neovascularization of carotid plaques. Future research will have to define the reliability and validity of CEUS in everyday clinical practice. Further, our study suggests that CEUS may also be useful to pick up features of vulnerable plaques such as acute intraplaque hemorrhages."

The medical records of 2496 type 2 diabetic patients without DFU served as control data. DR prevalence and severity were assessed in DFU patients. DFU patients were compared with the control group regarding each clinical variable. Additionally, DFU patients were divided into two groups according to DR severity and compared.Out of 100 DFU patients, 90 patients (90%) had DR and 55 (55%) had proliferative DR (PDR). There was no significant association between DR and DFU severities (R = 0.034, p = 0.734). A multivariable analysis comparing type 2 diabetic patients with and without DFUs showed that the presence of DR [OR, 226.12; 95% confidence interval (CI), 58.07-880.49; p < 0.001] and proliferative DR [OR, 306.27; 95% CI, 64.35-1457.80; p < 0.001), higher HbA1c (%, OR, 1.97, 95% CI, 1.46-2.67; p < 0.001), higher serum creatinine (mg/dL, OR, 1.62, 95% CI, 1.06-2.50; p = 0.027), older age (years, OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.06-1.17; p < 0.001), higher pulse pressure (mmHg, OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.06; p = 0.025), lower cholesterol (mg/dL, OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92-0.97; p < 0.001), lower BMI (kg/m2, OR, 0.87, 95% CI, 0.75-1.00; p = 0.044) and lower hematocrit (%, OR, 0.80, 95% CI, 0.74-0.87; p < 0.001) were associated with DFUs. In a subgroup analysis of DFU patients, the PDR group had a longer duration of diabetes mellitus, higher serum BUN, and higher serum creatinine than the non-PDR group. In the multivariable analysis, only higher serum creatinine was associated with PDR in DFU patients (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.05-1.78; p = 0.021).Diabetic retinopathy is prevalent in patients with DFU and about half of DFU patients had PDR. No significant association was found in terms of the severity of these two diabetic complications. To prevent blindness, patients with DFU, and especially those with high serum creatinine, should undergo retinal examinations for timely PDR diagnosis and management."

Loss of cartilage matrix is accompanied by an increase in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 13, partially because of enhanced LEF1 transcriptional activity. In this study, we assessed the role of SIRT1 in LEF1-mediated MMP13 gene expression in human OA chondrocytes. Results showed that MMP13 protein levels and enzymatic activity decreased significantly during SIRT1 overexpression or activation by resveratrol. Conversely, MMP13 gene expression was reduced in chondrocytes transfected with SIRT1 siRNA or treated with nicotinamide (NAM), a sirtuin inhibitor. Chondrocytes challenged with IL-1β, a cytokine involved in OA pathogenesis, enhanced LEF1 protein levels and gene expression, resulting in increased MMP13 gene expression; however, overexpression of SIRT1 during IL-1β challenge impeded LEF1 levels and MMP13 gene expression. Previous reports showed that LEF1 binds to the MMP13 promoter and transactivates its expression, but we observed that SIRT1 repressed LEF1 protein and mRNA expression, ultimately reducing LEF1 transcriptional activity, as judged by luciferase assay. Finally, mouse articular cartilage from Sirt1‒/‒presented increased LEF1 and MMP13 protein levels, similar to human OA cartilage. Thus, demonstrating for the first time that SIRT1 represses MMP13 in human OA chondrocytes, which appears to be mediated, at least in part, through repression of the transcription factor LEF1, a known modulator of MMP13 gene expression.—Elayyan, J., Lee, E.-J., Gabay, O., Smith, C.

However, the cellular/molecular mechanisms that account for the fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation/activation in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis remain poorly understood. We investigated the functional role of hyaluronan receptor CD44V6 (CD44 containing variable exon 6 (v6)) for differentiation of lung fibroblast to myofibroblast phenotype. Increased hyaluronan synthesis and CD44 expression have been detected in numerous fibrotic organs. Previously, we found that the TGFβ1/CD44V6 pathway is important in lung myofibroblast collagen-1 and α-smooth-muscle actin synthesis.

TGFβ1-mediated CD44V6 up-regulation was initiated through EGR1 via ERK-regulated transcriptional activation. We showed that TGFβ1-induced CD44V6 expression is through EGR1-mediated AP-1 (activator protein-1) activity and that the EGR1- and AP-1-binding sites in the CD44v6 promoter account for its responsiveness to TGFβ1 in lung fibroblasts. We also identified a positive-feedback loop in which ERK/EGR1 signaling promotes CD44V6 splicing and found that CD44V6 then sustains ERK signaling, which is important for AP-1 activity in lung fibroblasts.

Ponta H. CD44 is required for two consecutive steps in HGF/c-Met signaling.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3074-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), or through activation of EGR1 (11.Recio J.A. Merlino G. Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor induces feedback up-regulation of CD44v6 in melanoma cells through Egr-1.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1576-1582PubMed Google Scholar) or AP-1 (12.Foster L.C. Arkonac B.M. Sibinga N.E. Shi C. Perrella M.A. Haber E. Regulation of CD44 gene expression by the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β in vascular smooth muscle cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20341-20346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the role of EGR1 and/or AP-1 in TGFβ1-induced CD44V6 expression/activity has not been defined in any cell type. To determine the functions of TGFβ1-induced CD44V6 and the mechanisms that mediate CD44V6 expression and activity, we investigated activation of EGR1 in normal lung fibroblasts treated with TGFβ1. CD44V6 has been shown to be stimulated through activation of Ras/ERK signaling (10.Orian-Rousseau V. Chen L. Sleeman J.P. Herrlich P. Ponta H. CD44 is required for two consecutive steps in HGF/c-Met signaling.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3074-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The EGR1 gene is induced by growth factors through different signaling pathways, including the Ras/MAP kinase pathways (13.Lo L.W. Cheng J.J. Chiu J.J. Wung B.S. Liu Y.C. Wang D.L. Endothelial exposure to hypoxia induces Egr-1 expression involving PKCα-mediated Ras/Raf-1/ERK1/2 pathway.J. Cell Physiol. 2001; 188: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Given the crucial role of CD44V6 signaling in cellular processes, including cell survival, proliferation, and migration, it is likely that CD44V6 expression is also regulated in fibrogenic conditions. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrate a crucial role for TGFβ1 in controlling CD44V6 splicing in human lung fibrogenic fibroblast proliferation/activation through MAPK/ERK1/2 (8.Ghatak S. Bogatkevich G.S. Atnelishvili I. Akter T. Feghali-Bostwick C. Hoffman S. Fresco V.M. Fuchs J.C. Visconti R.P. Markwald R.R. Padhye S.B. Silver R.M. Hascall V.C. Misra S.

Chem. 2014; 289: 7856-7872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Despite its importance, however, the mechanisms underlying the sustained activity of MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling have remained less understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the TGFβ1-dependent regulation of fibroblast differentiation through EGR1 and CD44V6. Our results show that TGFβ1-induced ERK/EGR1 signal transduction is both necessary and sufficient to stimulate CD44V6. In conjunction with EGR1-induced AP-1, CD44V6 subsequently facilitates lung myofibroblast differentiation. Our results show that a positive-feedback loop couples sustained ERK/EGR1 signaling to CD44v6 in response to TGFβ1. However, we have also demonstrated that TGFβ1-stimulated HAS2 overexpression is required to initiate CD44V6/ERK/EGR1 coupling to mediate differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. Our data indicate that HAS2 activation in TGFβ1-stimulated human normal lung fibroblasts (HNLFbs) mediates co-localization of CD44 with TGFβ receptor 1 (TGFβRI), leading to phosphorylation of ERK and, subsequently, EGR1 signaling. Therefore, HAS2-regulated HA synthesis is a major determining factor in the phenotypic activation of fibroblasts. This change in phenotype also involves the simultaneous activation of the following cooperating pathways. 1) TGFβ1/ERK/EGR1-dependent signaling stimulates CD44V6 expression/activity; 2) EGR1-dependent AP-1 activity mediates enhanced CD44V6 expression in response to TGFβ1-induced signaling; 3) a feedback loop between activated ERK/EGR1 and CD44V6 sustains CD44V6 expression in response to TGFβ1 stimulation; and 4) HA facilitates TGFβ1-dependent fibroblast differentiation through HA-CD44V6 binding and promoting interaction between the CD44V6 and TGFβRI. This then promotes specific intracellular signal transduction through the ERK pathway and subsequently through EGR1, both acting to cooperate with the TGFβ1/ERK/EGR1/CD44V6 feedback loop pathway, resulting in fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation. We have previously shown that expression of CD44V6 is directly related to fibrogenic function of human lung myofibroblasts (8.Ghatak S. Bogatkevich G.S. Atnelishvili I. Akter T. Feghali-Bostwick C. Hoffman S. Fresco V.M. Fuchs J.C. Visconti R.P. Markwald R.R. Padhye S.B. Silver R.M. Hascall V.C. Misra S.

At the peak of lung collagen gene expression at day 14 after bleomycin lung injury in mice, the cells primarily responsible for fibrosis are activated myofibroblasts, as defined by expression of α-SMA. Several key features of fibrotic reactions in mammalian lung tissues, including TGFβ1 up-regulation, contractile filament-laden stromal cells, and myofibroblast differentiation and activation, are recapitulated in the bleomycin-injured mouse model of fibrosis (14.Zhang K. Rekhter M.D. Gordon D. Phan S.H. Myofibroblasts and their role in lung collagen gene expression during pulmonary fibrosis: a combined immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization study.Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 114-125PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Santana A. Saxena B. Noble N.A. Gold L.I. Marshall B.C.

Biol. 1995; 13: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used the mouse model of acute pulmonary fibrosis, initiated by tracheal installation of the bleomycin, to define the in vivo role of CD44V6 in the acute inflammatory (weeks 1–3) and reparative (weeks 3–7) phases of lung injury (15.Santana A. Saxena B. Noble N.A. Gold L.I. Marshall B.C. Increased expression of transforming growth factor β isoforms (β1, β2, β3) in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, the functional similarities and differences between myofibroblasts and fibroblasts are not fully understood because they have not been separately isolated from a living tissue. To understand the biological properties of myofibroblasts and fibroblasts in injured lung tissues, we isolated them from saline control and bleomycin-injured mouse lungs at the fibrogenic phase (day 14 after injury) by using fluorescence-activated cell sorting as described previously (16.McQualter J.L. Brouard N. Williams B. Baird B.N. Sims-Lucas S. Yuen K. Nilsson S.K. Simmons P.J. Bertoncello I. Endogenous fibroblastic progenitor cells in the adult mouse lung are highly enriched in the sca-1 positive cell fraction.Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To isolate myofibroblasts and fibroblasts from the lungs, many cell types need to be eliminated when using FACS. Lungs are composed of many types of cells: epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-positive epithelial cells; CD31-positive vascular endothelial cells; lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor (Lyve-1)-positive lymphatic endothelial cells, CD45-positive leukocytes, pericytes, and mesothelial cells. Initially, lineage-negative cells, which do not express these lineage-specific cell surface markers, were isolated, and α-Sma was compared between unfractionated cells and lineage-negative cells using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR). In saline-treated lungs, the α-SMA mRNA expression level in lineage(−) cells was 3.2-fold higher than in corresponding lineage(+) cells (Fig. 1A). In 14-day post-bleomycin-treated lungs, the α-SMA expression level in lineage(−) cells was 13-fold higher than in corresponding lineage(+) cells (Fig. 1A). Because stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1) is expressed in perivascular fibroblasts in normal lung tissue, we sorted the lineage(−) cells for Sca-1. In saline-treated lungs, lineage(−)/Sca(+) cells (L(−)/S(+)/PBS cells) had 3.5-fold higher α-Sma (Fig. 1B), 0.23-fold higher CD44v6 (Fig. 1C), and 4.7-fold higher collagen-1 (Col1a1) (Fig. 1D) mRNA expressions, respectively, compared with unfractionated fibroblasts. In 14-day post-bleomycin-treated lungs, lineage(−)/Sca(+) cells (L(−)/S(+)/14dBleo cells) had 5.4-fold higher α-Sma (Fig. 1B), 1.3-fold higher CD44v6 (Fig. 1C), and 8.7-fold higher Col1a1 (Fig. 1D) mRNA expressions compared with unfractionated fibroblasts. Because CD49e, but not Sca-1, was expressed in myofibroblasts in bleomycin-injured lungs (16.McQualter J.L. Brouard N. Williams B. Baird B.N. Sims-Lucas S. Yuen K. Nilsson S.K. Simmons P.J. Bertoncello I. Endogenous fibroblastic progenitor cells in the adult mouse lung are highly enriched in the sca-1 positive cell fraction.Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we isolated lineage(−)/Sca(−)/CD49e(+) cells from 14-day post-bleomycin-treated lungs (L(−)/S(−)/C(+)/14dBleo cells). The expressions of α-Sma (14-fold), CD44v6 (15-fold), and Col1a1 (22-fold) genes are very high compared with unfractionated fibroblasts (Fig. 1, B–D). Approximately 64,000 ± 15,000 cells (n = 3) of a lineage(−)/Sca(+) population were isolated from a lung of a PBS-treated mouse (L(−)/S(+)/PBS cells), and ∼26,000 ± 7000 cells (n = 3) of a lineage(−)/Sca(+) population were isolated from 14-day post-bleomycin-treated lungs (L(−)/S(+)/14dBleo cells). Approximately 44,000 ± 12,000 cells (n = 3) of a lineage(−)/Sca(−)/CD49e(+) population were isolated from a lung of a 14-day post-bleomycin-injured mouse (L(−)/S(−)/C(+)/14dBleo cells). The number of lineage(−)/Sca(−)/CD49e(−) cells (L(−)/S(−)/C(−)/14dBleo cells) was very low (2356 ± 785 cells (n = 3)), compared with the above fractions (L(−)/S(+)/14dBleo cells and L(−)/S(−)/C(+)/14dBleo cells) isolated from a 14-day post-bleomycin-treated mouse lung. Therefore, we did not further analyze these cells. These gene expression profiles show that fibroblasts isolated from PBS-treated murine normal lung (MNLFbs) and fibroblasts isolated from 14-day-post-bleomycin-injured lung (14dBLMFbs) are enriched in lineage(−)/Sca(+) cells (L(−)/S(+)/14dBleo cells). Consistent with a previous study (17.Akamatsu T. Arai Y. Kosugi I. Kawasaki H. Meguro S. Sakao M. Shibata K. Suda T. Chida K. Iwashita T. Direct isolation of myofibroblasts and fibroblasts from bleomycin-injured lungs reveals their functional similarities and differences.Fibrogenesis Tissue Repair. 2013; 6: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the myofibroblasts from the bleomycin-injured lung (14dBLMFbs) are enriched in lineage(−)/Sca(−)/CD49e(+) cells (L(−)/S(−)/C(+)/14dBleo cells). We previously reported that normal lung fibroblasts treated with TGFβ1 for 8 h up-regulated CD44V6 expression and that CD44V6, which is highly expressed in human lung myofibroblasts and in bleomycin-induced murine lung myofibroblasts, is responsible for TGFβ1 autoregulation (8.Ghatak S. Bogatkevich G.S. Atnelishvili I. Akter T. Feghali-Bostwick C. Hoffman S. Fresco V.M. Fuchs J.C. Visconti R.P. Markwald R.R. Padhye S.B. Silver R.M. Hascall V.C. Misra S.

Expression levels of CD44 and regulation of the alternative splicing of the variants are stimulated in response to hormones, cytokines, and growth factors, particularly by the Ras/ERK pathway (18.Monaghan M.

Carmen J.A. Monroe J.G. Transcriptional regulation of the Icam-1 gene in antigen receptor- and phorbol ester-stimulated B lymphocytes: role for transcription factor EGR1.J. Exp.

CD44 expression and regulation during mammary gland development and function.J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2619-2630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the specific mechanism to define a CD44v6/EGR-1/AP-1 signaling axis for activation of TGFβ1 expression and TGFβ1-mediated responses in lung fibrosis are unknown. Thus, we hypothesized that a feedback loop, in which expression of both EGR1 and CD44V6 is up-regulated in fibrogenic fibroblasts in response to exposure to TGFβ1, represents an important mechanism whereby fibrogenic fibroblasts establish and maintain constitutive stimulation of proliferative and differentiation-promoting pathways. First, consistent with our previous findings (8.Ghatak S. Bogatkevich G.S. Atnelishvili I. Akter T. Feghali-Bostwick C. Hoffman S. Fresco V.M. Fuchs J.C. Visconti R.P. Markwald R.R. Padhye S.B. Silver R.M. Hascall V.C. Misra S. Overexpression of c-Met and CD44v6 receptors contributes to autocrine TGF-β1 signaling in interstitial lung disease.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 7856-7872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we determined whether primary fibroblasts isolated from lungs after bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in wild type (WT) mice demonstrate a time-dependent increase of CD44v6 protein. After bleomycin instillation, CD44v6 increased ∼1.4-fold by day 3, peaked at ∼11-fold by days 14–21, and decreased to ∼3.4-fold by day 45 (Fig. 2A, top panel shows Western blot analyses for CD44v6 and β-tubulin protein, and bottom panel shows the densitometry graph of expression of these proteins from three sets of experiments). We also examined collagen-1 expression by Masson's trichrome staining and expression of CD44v6 by immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections of 0-, 21-, and 45-day post-bleomycin-treated murine lungs. Fig. 2B shows that collagen-1 expression is greatly increased at day 21 after bleomycin injury and is decreased toward normal level at day 45. Similarly, CD44v6 was barely detectable in normal lung but was significantly localized 21 days after bleomycin injury, with significant decrease to near control by day 45. These results (Fig. 2) suggest that CD44v6 induction occurs specifically in the sites of lung injury in this mouse model. The pattern of CD44v6 expression in the fibrotic lung (Fig. 2) is similar to the changes in expression of TGFβ1 and TGFβ receptor 1 (TGFβRI), which are induced as early as 3 days after bleomycin injury (15.Santana A. Saxena B. Noble N.A. Gold L.I. Marshall B.C. Increased expression of transforming growth factor β isoforms (β1, β2, β3) in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24.Zhao Y. Shah D.U. Expression of transforming growth factor-β type I and type II receptors is altered in rat lungs undergoing bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2000; 69: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This close time-based association suggests that increased level of TGFβ1 may up-regulate CD44v6 through its receptor and that TGFβ1 may be, at least partially, responsible for CD44v6 induction in BLMFbs. Therefore, we examined whether other fibrogenic parameters, such as Col1a1 synthesis, hyaluronan secretion, and α-Sma synthesis, are associated with the CD44v6 synthesis in ex vivo primary BLMFbs cultures (7, 14, 21, and 45 days post-bleomycin injury) and in MNLFb cultures. Fig. 3A shows that body weights of bleomycin-injured mice decreased in days 7–14 due to systemic effects of lung injury, with increases to normal during the fibrosis resolving phase, days 21–45. Collagen secretion was demonstrated by extracellular acid-soluble collagen measured using the Sircol assay (Fig. 3B), and acid-insoluble total collagen contents were determined by the hydroxyproline assays of lung tissue homogenates (Fig. 3C). Both increased from day 7 to 21 with some decrease by day 45, in contrast to the constant concentrations in the saline control lungs, consistent with the Masson's trichrome staining results in Fig. 2B. BLMFbs and MNLFbs were isolated by flow-cytometry sorting and analyzed in cultures as reported previously (17.Akamatsu T. Arai Y. Kosugi I. Kawasaki H. Meguro S. Sakao M. Shibata K. Suda T. Chida K. Iwashita T. Direct isolation of myofibroblasts and fibroblasts from bleomycin-injured lungs reveals their functional similarities and differences.Fibrogenesis Tissue Repair. 2013; 6: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan contents in the MNLFb cultures isolated from lungs at indicated days 7–45 remained constant. In contrast, hylauronan contents in BLMFb cultures isolated from the bleomycin-treated mice at day 7 increased ∼7-fold compared with the MNLFb cultures, with a modest reduction in BLMFb cultures from day 21 to 45 after bleomycin treatment (Fig. 3D). These results provide evidence that sustained hyaluronan content may contribute to the reparative phase. Because HA is synthesized on the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane by three mammalian HA synthase isoenzymes (25.Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Characterization and molecular evolution of a vertebrate hyaluronan synthase gene family.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1923-1932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), we measured the Has1/2/3 mRNA expressions in the isolated fibroblasts from post-bleomycin-injured lung. Results (Fig. 3E) show that Has2 expression declines in the resolution phase (45 days post-bleomycin injury in the lung), whereas Has1 and Has3 expressions remain the same as were found in the fibrogenic phase (Fig. 3E, 21 days versus 45 days). The α-Sma contents in the lungs also increased ∼6-fold by day 21 with reduction to basal level at day 45 (Fig. 3F). CD44v6 protein peaked at days 14–21 and decreased substantially at day 45 (Fig. 3F). In contrast, CD44s levels were low in the fibrogenic phase and increased substantially at day 45 (Fig. 3F), suggesting that sustained hyaluronan content (Fig. 3D) and increased CD44s (Fig. 3F) may contribute to the resolution phase after bleomycin-mediated lung injury. These results suggest a close association between CD44v6 and fibrogenic properties in ex vivo lung fibroblast cultures from the bleomycin-injured mice. Such close time-based association and spatial correlation between TGFβ1 and CD44v6 induction suggest a potential mechanism of TGFβ1 and its type I receptor (TGFβRI) in CD44v6 induction, which was analyzed for their interaction/binding in fibroblast cultures from human normal and IPF lungs (as shown in Fig. 7A of our companion paper by Ghatak et al. (91.Ghatak S. Hascall V.C. Markwald R.R. Feghali-Bostwick C. Artlett C.M. Gooz M. Bogatkevich G.S. Atanelishvili I. Silver R.M. Wood J. Thannickal V.J. Misra S.

We investigated the regulation of CD44v6 expression by TGFβ1 in MNLFb cultures at both mRNA and protein levels by using real-time PCR and WB analyses, respectively. Protein levels of CD44v6 were greatly increased after treatment in a dose-dependent (Fig. 4A, scatter plots) and time-dependent (Fig. 4C, scatter plots) manner. At 24 h, TGFβ1 at 2 ng/ml induced CD44v6 > 4-fold, and this level was close to the level for 5 ng/ml (Fig. 4A). At 2.5 ng/ml, CD44v6 protein was significantly increased already by 2 h after incubation and reached"
https://openalex.org/W2604941769,"Background Moringa oleifera (MO) and M. stenopetala (MS) (family Moringaceae; order Brassicales) are multipurpose tree/shrub species. They thrive under marginal environmental conditions and produce nutritious edible parts. The aim of this study was to determine the mineral composition of different parts of MO and MS growing in their natural environments and their potential role in alleviating human mineral micronutrient deficiencies (MND) in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods Edible parts of MO (n = 146) and MS (n = 50), co-occurring cereals/vegetables and soils (n = 95) underneath their canopy were sampled from localities in southern Ethiopia and Kenya. The concentrations of seven mineral elements, namely, calcium (Ca), copper (Cu), iodine (I), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) in edible parts and soils were determined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Results In Ethiopian crops, MS leaves contained the highest median concentrations of all elements except Cu and Zn, which were greater in Enset (a.k.a., false banana). In Kenya, Mo flowers and MS leaves had the highest median Se concentration of 1.56 mg kg-1 and 3.96 mg kg-1, respectively. The median concentration of Se in MS leaves was 7-fold, 10-fold, 23-fold, 117-fold and 147-fold more than that in brassica leaves, amaranth leaves, baobab fruits, sorghum grain and maize grain, respectively. The median Se concentration was 78-fold and 98-fold greater in MO seeds than in sorghum and maize grain, respectively. There was a strong relationship between soil total Se and potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4)-extractable Se, and Se concentration in the leaves of MO and MS. Conclusion This study confirms previous studies that Moringa is a good source of several of the measured mineral nutrients, and it includes the first wide assessment of Se and I concentrations in edible parts of MO and MS grown in various localities. Increasing the consumption of MO and MS, especially the leaves as a fresh vegetable or in powdered form, could reduce the prevalence of MNDs, most notably Se deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2605318257,"Objectives Tigecycline is a treatment option for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP). Emerging tigecycline resistance in CRKP represents a growing threat. Knowledge of the clinical, microbiological, and molecular characteristics of tigecycline- and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (TCRKP) is limited. Methods Patients infected with TCRKP were identified from a Taiwanese national surveillance study. Clinical data were collected from medical records. We performed susceptibility tests, carbapenemase gene detection, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Furthermore, we performed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses to assess the expression levels of the efflux pump genes acrB and oqxB. Results We identified 16 patients infected with TCRKP, with urinary tract infection (UTI) being the most common type of infection (63%). The all-cause 30-day mortality rate was 44% in patients with TCRKP infection. Patients with a site of infection other than the urinary tract had a significantly higher mortality rate than patients with UTIs (83% vs. 20%, p = 0.035). PFGE and MLST revealed no dominant clone or sequence type. Using qRT-PCR, overexpression of both the acrB and oqxB genes was identified in seven isolates, and overexpression of the oqxB gene was observed in another seven. There was poor correlation between acrB or oqxB expression and tigecycline MICs (r = -0.038 and -0.166, respectively). Conclusions The mortality rate in patients infected with TCRKP in this study was 44% and this is an important subset of patients. The absence of a linear relationship between efflux pump genes expression and MICs indicates that tigecycline resistance may be mediated by other factors. Continuous monitoring of tigecycline resistance among CRKP isolates and resistance mechanisms are necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2605004927,"Introduction Whether amount of time spent in sedentary activities influences on clustered metabolic risk in elderly, and to what extent such an influence is independent of physical activity behavior, remain unclear. Therefore, the aim of the study was to examine cross-sectional associations of objectively assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior on metabolic risk outcomes in a sample of elderly community-dwelling women. Methods Metabolic risk outcomes including waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, fasting levels of plasma glucose, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides were assessed in 120 community-dwelling older women (65–70 yrs). Accelerometers were used to retrieve daily sedentary time, breaks in sedentary time, daily time in light (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and total amount of accelerometer counts. Multivariate regression models were used to examine influence of physical activity and sedentary behavior on metabolic risk outcomes including a clustered metabolic risk score. Results When based on isotemporal substitution modeling, replacement of a 10-min time block of MVPA with a corresponding time block of either LPA or sedentary activities was associated with an increase in clustered metabolic risk score (β = 0.06 to 0.08, p < 0.05), and an increase in waist circumference (β = 1.78 to 2.19 p < 0.01). All associations indicated between sedentary time and metabolic risk outcomes were lost once variation in total accelerometer counts was adjusted for. Conclusions Detrimental influence of a sedentary lifestyle on metabolic health is likely explained by variations in amounts of physical activity rather than amount of sedentary time per se. Given our findings, increased amounts of physical activity with an emphasis on increased time in MVPA should be recommended in order to promote a favorable metabolic health profile in older women."
https://openalex.org/W2604579450,"Harmful algae may differently affect their primary grazers, causing sub-lethal effects and/or leading to their death. The present study aim to compare the effects of three toxic benthic dinoflagellates on clearance and grazing rates, behavioral changes, and survival of Artemia salina. Feeding assays consisted in 1-h incubations of brine shrimps with the toxic Prorocentrum lima, Gambierdiscus excentricus and Ostreopsis cf. ovata and the non-toxic Tetraselmis sp. Brine shrimps fed unselectively on all toxic and non-toxic algal preys, without significant differences in clearance and ingestion rates. Acute toxicity assays were performed with dinoflagellate cells in two growth phases during 7-h to assess differences in cell toxicity to A. salina. Additionally, exposure to cell-free medium was performed to evaluate its effects on A. salina survival. The behavior of brine shrimps significantly changed during exposure to the toxic dinoflagellates, becoming immobile at the bottom by the end of the trials. Dinoflagellates significantly affected A. salina survival with 100% mortality after 7-h exposure to cells in exponential phase (all treatments) and to P. lima in stationary phase. Mortality rates of brine shrimps exposed to O. cf. ovata and G. excentricus in stationary phase were 91% and 75%, respectively. However, incubations of the brine shrimps with cell-free medium did not affect A. salina survivorship. Significant differences in toxic effects between cell growth phases were only found in the survival rates of A. salina exposed to G. excentricus. Acute exposure to benthic toxic dinoflagellates induced harmful effects on behavior and survival of A. salina. Negative effects related to the toxicity of benthic dinoflagellates are thus expected on their primary grazers making them more vulnerable to predation and vectors of toxins through the marine food webs."

Secondary data were obtained from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. Results A total of 21,263 patients were included in the final analysis. The majority of the patients received treatment within 30 days of diagnosis (n = 18,193, 85.5%), while 572 patients (2.7%) underwent treatment after 120 days. The patients who were treated after 120 days had a higher risk of death when compared to those treated within 30 days (Hazard ratio: 1.32, 95% Confidence intervals: 1.19 to 1.47). Conclusion A longer time interval from diagnosis to treatment was found to be associated with a poorer prognosis among patients suffering from oral squamous cell carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2604244006,"Objective This study aimed to identify potentially important factors in explaining burnout in nursing that have been insufficiently studied or ignored. Methods A three-round Delphi study via e-mail correspondence was conducted, with a group of 40 European experts. The e-Delphi questionnaire consisted of 52 factors identified from a literature review. Experts rated and scored the importance of factors in the occurrence of burnout and the degree of attention given by researchers to each of the variables listed, on a six-point Likert scale. We used the agreement percentage (>80%) to measure the level of consensus between experts. Furthermore, to confirm the level of consensus, we also calculated mean scores and modes. Regardless of the degree of consensus reached by the experts, we have calculated the mean of the stability of the answers for each expert (individual's qualitative stability) and the mean of the stability percentages of the experts (qualitative group stability). Results The response rate in the three rounds was 93.02% (n = 40). Eight new factors were suggested in the first round. After modified, the e-Delphi questionnaire in the second and third rounds had 60 factors. All the factors reached the third round with a consensus level above 80% in terms of the attention that researchers gave them in their studies. Moreover, the data show a total mean qualitative group stability of 96.21%. In the third round 9 factors were classified by experts as ‘studied very little’, 17 as ‘studied little’ and 34 as 'well studied' Conclusion Findings show that not all the factors that may influence nursing burnout have received the same attention from researchers. The panel of experts has identified factors that, although important in explaining burnout, have been poorly studied or even forgotten. Our results suggest that further study into factors such as a lack of recognition of part of the tasks that nurses perform, feminine stereotype or excessive bureaucracy is needed for a better understanding of this syndrome and improve the quality of life in nurses."
https://openalex.org/W2604830165,"The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a major regulator of cell behavior. Recent studies have indicated the importance of the physical properties of the ECM, including its stiffness, for cell migration and differentiation. Using actomyosin-generated forces, cells pull the ECM and sense stiffness via cell-ECM adhesion structures called focal adhesions (FAs). Vinculin, an actin-binding FA protein, has emerged as a major player in FA-mediated mechanotransduction. Although vinculin is important for sensing ECM stiffness, the role of vinculin binding to actin in the ECM stiffness-mediated regulation of vinculin behavior remains unknown. Here, we show that an actin binding-deficient mutation disrupts the ECM stiffness-dependent regulation of CSB (cytoskeleton stabilization buffer) resistance and the stable localization of vinculin. These results suggest that the vinculin-actin interaction participates in FA-mediated mechanotransduction."

EBV DNA load was measured in saliva of 48 patients and 50 controls. Patients underwent clinical assessment with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and after a median of 20 months of follow-up (n = 63 for MRI, n = 71 for EDSS). The association of EBV parameters with occurrence of a second relapse, indicating conversion to clinically definite MS (CDMS), was evaluated over a median of 35 months of follow-up after the first clinical event (n = 89).EBNA-1 IgG antibody frequency (p = 0.00005) and EBNA-1 and VCA IgG antibody levels (p<0.0001 for both) were higher in patients than in controls. EBV DNA load in saliva did not differ between groups. Neither EBV antibody levels nor DNA load in saliva were associated with baseline or follow-up number or volume of T2-weighted (T2w) or contrast enhancing lesions, number of Barkhof criteria or the EDSS, or with the number of new T2w lesions, T2w lesion volume change or EDSS change on follow-up. Likewise, levels of EBV IgG antibodies in serum and DNA load in saliva were not associated with conversion to CDMS.While these findings confirm the association of EBV infection with early MS, neither EBNA-1 nor VCA IgG antibodies in serum nor EBV DNA load in saliva were associated with radiological or clinical disease activity in patients with CIS/early RRMS. These data are compatible with the concept that EBV may be a trigger for MS acting very early during the development of the disease."

The mechanisms of regulation of fluid-phase pinocytosis in macrophages and, specifically, the role of Akt kinases are poorly understood. We have found previously that increased lipoprotein uptake via the receptor-independent process in Akt3 kinase-deficient macrophages contributes to increased atherosclerosis in Akt3−/− mice. The mechanism by which Akt3 deficiency promotes lipoprotein uptake in macrophages is unknown. We now report that Akt3 constitutively suppresses macropinocytosis in macrophages through a novel WNK1/SGK1/Cdc42 pathway. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that the lack of Akt3 expression in murine and human macrophages results in increased expression of with-no-lysine kinase 1 (WNK1), which, in turn, leads to increased activity of serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1). SGK1 promotes expression of the Rho family GTPase Cdc42, a positive regulator of actin assembly, cell polarization, and pinocytosis. Individual suppression of WNK1 expression, SGK1, or Cdc42 activity in Akt3-deficient macrophages rescued the phenotype.

We investigated the expression pattern and clinical significance of MYL9 in patients with ESCC.We examined MYL9 expression using quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting in NE1 immortalized esophageal epithelial cells, ESCC cell lines, and paired ESCC tissues. MYL9 protein in 136 primary ESCC tissues and other types of solid tumor was detected using immunohistochemistry. The association between MYL9 expression and clinical parameters and survival was evaluated by statistical analysis.MYL9 was significantly upregulated in the ESCC cell lines as compared with NE1 cells. In the paired ESCC samples, MYL9 mRNA and protein expression was not significantly different between lesion tissues and the matched adjacent noncancerous tissues. In ESCC tissue, both intratumoral and peritumoral stroma were positive for MYL9. In the 136 ESCC samples, high MYL9 expression in the tumor cells significantly correlated with histological differentiation (p = 0.028), recurrence (p = 0.01), and vital status (p < 0.01). Patients with high MYL9 expression in the tumor cells had poorer overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that high MYL9 expression in tumor cells was an independent and significant risk factor affecting OS after curative treatment (hazard ratio = 2.254, 95% confidence interval = 1.347-3.771, p = 0.002).MYL9 expression might be a promising prognostic marker and therapeutic target in ESCC."
https://openalex.org/W2604998011,"Successful navigation of our complex social world requires the capability to recognize and judge the relative status of others. Hence, social comparison processes are of great importance in our interactions, informing us of our relative standing and in turn potentially motivating our behavior. However, so far few studies have examined in detail how social comparison can influence interpersonal decision-making. One aspect of social decision-making that is of particular importance is cooperative behavior, and identifying means of maintaining and promoting cooperation in the provision of public goods is of vital interest to society. Here, we manipulated social comparison by grading performance rankings on a reaction time task, and then measured cooperative decisions via a modified Public Goods Game (PGG). Findings revealed that individuals ranked highest tended to be more cooperative as compared to those who placed in the bottom rank. Interestingly, this effect was regardless of whether the comparison group members were the subsequent players in the PGG or not, and this effect was stronger in those with higher social orientation. In summary, the present research shows how different social comparison processes (assessed via social rankings) can operate in our daily interaction with others, demonstrating an important effect on cooperative behavior."

To improve the outcomes of hearing restoration in deaf patients, it is important to understand the anatomic structure and composition of the cochlea ex vivo. Hitherto, only one histological technique based on confocal laser scanning microscopy and optical clearing has been developed for in toto optical imaging of the murine cochlea. However, with a growing size of the specimen, e.g., human cochlea, this technique reaches its limitations. Here, we demonstrate scanning laser optical tomography (SLOT) as a valuable imaging technique to visualize the murine cochlea in toto without any physical slicing. This technique can also be applied in larger specimens up to cm3 such as the human cochlea. Furthermore, immunolabeling allows visualization of inner hair cells (otoferlin) or spiral ganglion cells (neurofilament) within the whole cochlea. After image reconstruction, the 3D dataset was used for digital segmentation of the labeled region. As a result, quantitative analysis of position, length and curvature of the labeled region was possible. This is of high interest in order to understand the interaction of cochlear implants (CI) and cells in more detail."
https://openalex.org/W2604247805,"The kinase interaction motif (KIM) family of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) includes hematopoietic protein-tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP), striatal-enriched protein-tyrosine phosphatase (STEP), and protein-tyrosine phosphatase receptor type R (PTPRR). KIM-PTPs bind and dephosphorylate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and thereby critically modulate cell proliferation and differentiation. PTP activity can readily be diminished by reactive oxygen species (ROS), e.g. H2O2, which oxidize the catalytically indispensable active-site cysteine. This initial oxidation generates an unstable sulfenic acid intermediate that is quickly converted into either a sulfinic/sulfonic acid (catalytically dead and irreversible inactivation) or a stable sulfenamide or disulfide bond intermediate (reversible inactivation).

Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are products of normal cellular metabolism and are generated by mitochondria, membrane, and cytoplasmic enzymes, such as NADPH oxidase and 5-lipoxygenase. One of the primary classes of cellular enzymes that are reversibly regulated by ROS are PTPs (9Meng T.C. Fukada T. Tonks N.K. Reversible oxidation and inactivation of protein tyrosine phosphatases in vivo.Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). This is because the catalytic cysteine residues of PTPs are thiolate ions (Cys-S-) at neutral pH, making them particularly sensitive to oxidation by various oxidants, including H2O2 (10Tanner J.J.

For example, ROS induces enhanced insulin signaling by inhibiting PTP1B and TC45 (11Mahadev K. Zilbering A. Zhu L. Goldstein B.J.

Similarly, ROS terminates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling via inhibition of PTEN (13Loh K. Deng H. Fukushima A. Cai X. Boivin B. Galic S. Bruce C. Shields B.J. Skiba B. Ooms L.M.

ROS also inhibits KIM-PTPs, which leads to the activation of MAPK pathways (14Lee K. Esselman W.J. Inhibition of PTPs by H2O2 regulates the activation of distinct MAPK pathways.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Thus, efforts to ”trap“ the inactive oxidized state of KIM-PTPs, which would prevent them from returning to their enzymatically active state, provides an attractive route for PTP inhibition and, as a consequence, an approach for developing therapeutics against cancer and Alzheimer's disease (15Haque A.

In cells, the reversible oxidation state of the active site cysteine of PTPs is controlled by cellular redox buffers as well as protein reductases, which function to prevent the formation of these irreversible modifications (24Lo Conte M.

PTP1B, which forms a sulfenamide bond upon ROS exposure, is the canonical PTP that has been used to understand how classical PTPs are reversibly oxidized in cells (25Tonks N.K. Redox redux: revisiting PTPs and the control of cell signaling.Cell. 2005; 121: 667-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that many PTPs and dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs; DUSPs use a cysteine-based catalytic mechanism identical to that of PTPs) rarely form sulfenamide intermediates, but instead form intramolecular disulfide bonds to protect against irreversible oxidation (20Tsai S.J.

To understand how the family of KIM-PTPs are regulated by ROS, we investigated their oxidation by H2O2 and their reactivation by dithiothreitol (DTT). Our results show that STEP and PTPRR are stabilized by an intramolecular disulfide bond upon oxidation, similar to other cytoplasmic PTPs and DUSPs. However, both STEP and PTPRR are slowly reactivated by DTT compared with other PTPs. We also used kinetic assays, iodoacetamide labeling, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry (MS) to show that HePTP uses a novel mechanism, namely the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond, to prevent its irreversible oxidation, which leads to the reversible dimerization of HePTP. We used the catalytic domains of HePTP (residues 44–339), STEP (residues 244–539), and PTPRR (residues 361–655) to determine the H2O2-mediated oxidation and subsequent thiol-mediated regeneration of KIM-PTP activities. To determine the sensitivity of the KIM-PTPs to H2O2-mediated oxidation, each KIM-PTP was incubated with a range of H2O2 concentrations for 15 min and, after a 10-min incubation with buffer, their activities were measured. As expected, all KIM-PTPs are sensitive to H2O2-mediated oxidation (Fig. 2), with their steady-state activity decreasing with increasing H2O2 concentrations. However, they are not uniformly sensitive. Rather, STEP was the most and PTPRR the least sensitive to H2O2-mediated oxidation. Specifically, H2O2 concentrations of ∼60, 100, and 150 μm resulted in a 50% reduction of activity by STEP, HePTP, and PTPRR, respectively, whereas concentrations of ≥320, 400, and 500 μm fully abolished their activities (Fig. 2, A, C, and E). The oxidation was also time-dependent. Namely, longer incubation times reduced the concentrations of H2O2 needed to inhibit STEP, HePTP, and PTPRR by 50 and 100%: 16/80, 32/320, and 20/100 μm, respectively (60 min; supplemental Fig. S1). We then asked if the observed H2O2-mediated oxidation of the KIM-PTPs was reversible (also known as thiol-dependent recovery, oxidation reversibility, or reactivation). In these experiments, the KIM-PTPs were oxidized as described above with the exception that 10 mm DTT was present during the 10-min incubation step prior to the activity measurements. The results show that the extent of reactivation was not uniform, but instead was specific to each KIM-PTP. The reactivation also varied with both H2O2 concentration and time. Namely, the measured IC50 values for H2O2-mediated inhibition increased by ∼4- (HePTP), 2- (STEP), and 1.5-fold (PTPRR) in the presence of DTT (60 min; Fig. 2, B, D, and F, and supplemental Fig. S1). Next we carried out a series of time-dependent oxidation and reactivation experiments to obtain the full kinetic oxidation profiles of HePTP, STEP, and PTPRR (Fig. 1). First, we determined the reactivity of KIM-PTPs toward oxidation (k1). In these experiments, the KIM-PTPs were incubated with different concentrations of H2O2 (25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 μm) for varying amounts of time (0–900 s; Fig. 3, A–C). The reactions were quenched by diluting into a buffer with catalase and the resulting activities were measured using pNPP as a substrate. The data show that the measured rates of H2O2-mediated inactivation varied linearly with H2O2 concentration, with second-order rate constants (k1) of 8.8 ± 0.7, 13.0 ± 0.5, and 17.8 ± 0.8 m−1 s−1 for HePTP, PTPRR, and STEP, respectively (Fig. 3, A–C, inset, and Table 1). These values are comparable with those obtained for other PTPs, including VHR (17.9 m−1 s−1) (26Denu J.M. Tanner K.G. Specific and reversible inactivation of protein tyrosine phosphatases by hydrogen peroxide: evidence for a sulfenic acid intermediate and implications for redox regulation.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), PTP1B (9.1 m−1 s−1) (27Parsons Z.D.

Open table in a new tab Next, we determined the rates of reactivation (k4) by DTT (k4; Fig. 1). In these experiments, HePTP, STEP, and PTPRR were oxidized by incubating with 500 μm H2O2 for 10 min. They were then rapidly mixed with varying concentrations of DTT (2.5 to 40 mm) and the pNPP substrate. The resulting rate constants (kobs) were then plotted as a function of the DTT concentration to obtain the reactivation rates (k4; Fig. 3, D and E). The determined k4 values were 0.8 ± 0.1 and 0.073 ± 0.006 m−1 s−1 for HePTP and STEP, respectively (Fig. 3, D and E, inset, Table 1); the reactivation rate for PTPRR could not be confidently determined. Taken together, the data show that STEP has a very slow DTT-mediated reactivation rate, whereas that of HePTP is similar to those obtained for other PTPs, including MKP3 (1–2 m−1 s−1), SHP1 (0.64 m−1 s−1), and SHP2 (0.46 m−1 s−1). Finally, we determined the irreversible inhibition rates (k2) for the KIM-PTPs. In these experiments, the KIM-PTPs were incubated with high concentrations of H2O2 (1000–5000 μm; Fig. 3, F–H). The observed rate constants (kobs) for each concentration were then plotted as function of the H2O2 concentration to obtain the irreversible oxidation rate (k2). This resulted in k2 values of 5.2 ± 0.6, 5.8 ± 0.9, and 29.4 ± 1.3 m−1 s−1 for HePTP, PTPRR, and STEP, respectively (Fig. 3, F–H, inset, Table 1, supplemental Fig. S2). Together, these data show that despite having highly similar 3D structures and sequences, each KIM-PTP family member has a very unique oxidation profile. In PTP1B, the reversible oxidation of the active site cysteine, Cys215, results in the formation of a sulfenamide bond with Ser216 (17Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Meng T.C. Hinks J.A.

Engl. 2015; 54: 13796-13800Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)) results in the formation of a disulfide bond between the active site cysteine and a second cysteine known as the “backdoor cysteine” (BC) (28Critton D.A. Tautz L. Page R. Visualizing active-site dynamics in single crystals of HePTP: opening of the WPD loop involves coordinated movement of the E loop.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 405: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Notably, PTP1B also contains a BC. Similarly, the residue C-terminal to the catalytic cysteine in PTPN22, CDC25B, and PTEN is also a serine. Why a particular mechanism (sulfenamide formation versus disulfide bond formation) is preferred by distinct PTPs is currently unknown. It is also unknown if additional molecular mechanisms exist that stabilize a reversible oxidized state of cytosolic PTPs. The KIM-PTPs also contain both BCs (HePTP(Cys183), STEP(Cys384), PTPRR(Cys501)) and serine residues immediately C-terminal to their catalytic cysteines (HePTP(Ser271), STEP(Ser473), PTPRR(Ser589)). To determine whether STEP and PTPRR use an intramolecular disulfide bond between their active site cysteines (STEP(Cys472) and PTPRR(Cys588)) and their BCs to protect against irreversible oxidation, we generated variants of both proteins in which the BC were mutated to Ser, STEP(C384S), and PTPRR(C501S), and measured their ability to be reactivated by DTT. Circular dichroism (CD) spectropolarimetry showed that the secondary structure and stability of both STEP(C384S) and PTPRR(C501S) were unaffected by the mutations (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). However, the catalytic activities of STEP(C384S) and PTPRR(C501S) were reduced 4- and 8-fold, respectively, when compared with their wt counterparts (supplemental Fig. S3, C and D; supplemental Table S1; to compensate for the reduced activity of STEP(C384S) and PTPRR(C501S), increased protein concentrations were used for all experiments). We then measured the H2O2-mediated inactivation and subsequent reactivation by DTT of both variants. Although STEP(C384S) is more resistant and PTPRR(C501S) is more sensitive to H2O2-mediated oxidation (Fig. 4, A and C), neither is capable of being reactivated by DTT (Fig. 4, B and D); i.e. oxidized STEP(C384S) and PTPRR(C501S) proceed directly to an irreversible oxidation state. This differs significantly from their wt counterparts, which both exhibit ∼5–7-fold more reactivation than the variants, respectively (Fig. 4, B and D). Together, these data demonstrate that BCs stabilize the reversible oxidation state of STEP and PTPRR. To further confirm that STEP(Cys384) and PTPRR(Cys501) are the BC residues that form disulfide bonds with their catalytic cysteines, we used LC/MS (mass spectrometry) in combination with iodoacetamide (IAM) labeling (29Roeser J. Bischoff R. Bruins A.P. Permentier H.P. Oxidative protein labeling in mass-spectrometry-based proteomics.Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2010; 397: 3441-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Sechi S. Chait B.T. Modification of cysteine residues by alkylation: a tool in peptide mapping and protein identification.Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 5150-5158Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). For this experiment, the individual proteins were incubated for 10 min with H2O2, to allow for disulfide bond formation, or incubated without H2O2. Samples were then treated with IAM to protect the free cysteine thiols. This was followed by tryptic digestion (in the absence of reducing agent to preserve existing disulfide bond(s)), after which the samples were analyzed using MS. As a control, a second set of samples was prepared identically with the exception that after digestion, the sample were incubated with both DTT (to reduce any disulfide bonds) and IAM (to label the now free cysteines previously protected by disulfide bonds); these control samples are expected to have MS profiles identical to the untreated samples. As predicted by the BC variant experiments, both disulfide-linked peptides were observed in the oxidized samples, which correspond to tryptic fragments with monoisotopic masses MH4+ and MH5+ of 1315.8737/1052.8972 and 572.2944/458.0387 for STEP and PTPRR, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B; supplemental Fig. S3E; Table 2). The peptides were not present in untreated samples (no H2O2). They were also not present when the oxidized samples were subsequently treated with DTT (Fig. 5, A and B; supplemental Fig. S3F; Table 2). This shows that the presence of these disulfide-linked peptides is strictly dependent on H2O2-mediated oxidation. To confirm that the observed disulfide-linked peptides were generated intra-molecularly, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. First, we collected a 2D [1H,15N]TROSY NMR spectrum for STEP and PTPRR, which are of high quality for 35-kDa proteins. We then oxidized both proteins using various concentrations of H2O2 for 10 min (the reaction was quenched using catalase). Only small chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) or minimal line broadening were observed for both PTPRR and STEP in oxidized versus non-oxidized samples. Mapping these CSPs on the primary sequence and structure of STEP (the sequence-specific backbone assignment is only available for STEP (31Francis D.M. Page R. Peti W. Sequence-specific backbone 1H, 13C and 15N assignments of the 34 kDa catalytic domain of PTPN5 (STEP).Biomol. NMR Assign. 2014; 8: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and not for PTPRR), showed that all CSPs are, as expected, in or around the active site (supplemental Fig. S4, A–D). Together, the kinetic, MS, and NMR data confirmed that the mechanism used by both STEP and PTPRR for reversible oxidation is intramolecular disulfide bond formation between their catalytic and backdoor cysteines.Table 2Monoisotopic masses of disulfide-linked peptides of HePTP, STEP, and PTPRR detected using LC-MSPTPsMH4+Mass differenceMH5+Mass differenceppmppmHePTP843.1815−0.2674.74725.0STEP1315.87376.01052.89733.0PTPRR572.29445.2458.03871.6 Open table in a new tab To identify the mechanism used by HePTP to stabilize its reversibly oxidized state, we generated a BC residue-deficient variant (HePTP(C183S)) and measured its ability to be reactivated.

Since mitochondria host several essential metabolic processes and play a pivotal role in cellular functions, whether and how mitochondrial function contributes to inflammation-induced bone destruction needs further exploration. Our findings revealed that TNF-α impaired osteoblast function, including decreased mRNA levels of osteogenic markers, suppressed ALP expression and activity, and compromised cellular viability. Moreover, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative stress in the TNF-α-treated group enhanced excessive mitochondrial fragmentation and disrupted mitochondrial function. However, treatment with antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) or mitochondrial division inhibitor Mdivi-1 protected the cells from these adverse phenomena. These findings provide new insights into the role of the Drp1-dependent mitochondrial pathway in the osteogenic dysfunction during inflammation, indicating that this pathway may be a target for the development of new therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of inflammation-induced bone destruction."

DAPK1 has been shown to play important role in apoptosis and autophagy to suppress cancer progression. Previous results have shown that DAPK1 promoter was hypermethylated in the majority of bladder cancer specimens, however, the prognostic significance of DAPK1 in bladder cancer has yet to be demonstrated. In the present study, we found that DAPK1 expression was negatively associated with tumor stage and a low level expression of DAPK1 in bladder cancer specimens were associated with shorter survival in bladder cancer patients in 3 independent bladder cancer datasets (n = 462). Further investigation showed that FGFR3 knockdown resulted in downregulation of DAPK1 in bladder cancer cell line, suggesting that FGFR3 may be an upstream factor of DAPK1. Further analysis of the 3 independent bladder cancer datasets have identified ACOX1, UPK2, TRAK1, PLEKHG6 and MT1X genes had their expression significantly correlated with that of DAPK1. Knockdown of DAPK1 in bladder cancer T24 cells resulted in downregulation of ACOX1, UPK2 and TRAK1. Interestingly, TRAK1, by itself, was a favorable prognostic marker in the 3 independent bladder cancer datasets. Importantly, by using connectivity mapping with DAPK1-associated gene signature, we found that vemurafenib and trametinib could possibly reverse DAPK1-associated gene signature, suggesting that inhibition of Raf/MEK pathway may be a potential therapeutic approach for bladder cancer. Indeed, treatment of vemurafenib in T24 bladder cancer cells resulted in upregulation of DAPK1 confirming our connectivity mapping, while knockdown of DAPK1 resulted in reduced sensitivity towards inhibition of Braf signaling by vemurafenib. Together, our results suggest that DAPK1 is an important prognostic marker and therapeutic target for bladder cancer and have identified possible therapeutic agents for future testing in bladder cancer models with low DAPK1 expression."

A comprehensive understanding of current procurement processes provides strong support for the development of effective policies. This study examined Brazilian Federal Government pharmaceutical procurement data provided by the Integrated System for the Administration of General Services (SIASG) database, from 2006 to 2013. Medicine purchases were aggregated by volume and expenditure for each year. Data on expenditure were adjusted for inflation using the Extended National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) for December 31, 2013. Lorenz distribution curves were used to study the cumulative proportion of purchased therapeutic classes. Expenditure variance analysis was performed to determine the impact of each factor, price and/or volume, on total expenditure variation. Annual expenditure on medicines increased 2.72 times, while the purchased volume of drugs increased 1.99 times. A limited number of therapeutic classes dominated expenditure each year. Drugs for infectious diseases drove the increase in expenditures from 2006 to 2009 but were replaced by antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents beginning in 2010. Immunosuppressants (L04), accounted for one third of purchases since 2010, showing the most substantial growth in expenditures during the period (250-fold increase). The overwhelming price-related increase in expenditures caused by these medicines is bound to have a relevant impact on the sustainability of the pharmaceutical supply system. We observed increasing trends in expenditures, especially in specific therapeutic classes. We propose the development and implementation of better medicine procurement systems, and strategies to allow for monitoring of product price, effectiveness, and safety. This must be done with ongoing assessment of pharmaceutical innovations, therapeutic value and budget impact."

The aim of these experiments was to explore the protective mechanism of an antioxidant, picroside II, on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (CI/R) injury. Methods To observe the antagonistic effect of picroside II on CI/R damage, the neurological deficit score and the infarct volume were measured. To detect the protective effect of picroside II on nerve cells and the BBB, the morphology and structure of cortical brain tissue were observed, respectively. To investigate the antioxidant effect and mechanism of picroside II, reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, the activity of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH oxidase), and the protein levels of Nox2 and Rac-1 were detected. To investigate the protective mechanism of picroside II on the BBB, the levels of ROCK, MLCK, MMP-2 and claudin-5 were tested. Results A higher neurological score, bigger cortex infarction, more damaged neuron structure and injured BBB, increased content of ROS and activity of NADPH oxidase, higher protein levels of Nox2, Rac-1, ROCK, MLCK and MMP-2 and lower levels of claudin-5 were observed in the model group. In the picroside group, the neurological score, neuronal damage, BBB injury, ROS content and NADPH oxidase activity were reduced (P<0.05), and the protein levels of Rac-1, Nox2, ROCK, MLCK and MMP-2 were down-regulated (P<0.05), while the expression of claudin-5 was up-regulated (P<0.05). Conclusions Picroside II could protect the nervous system possibly through reducing the content of ROS by down-regulating the expression of Rac-1 and Nox2 and could protect the BBB through reducing the expression of ROCK, MLCK, and MMP-2, while enhancing the expression of claudin-5."

This research was designed to elucidate the therapeutic effects of living and dead L. plantarum CCFM639 against chronic Al toxicity and to gain insight into the protection modes of this strain. Animals were assigned into control, Al only, Al + living CCFM639, and Al + dead CCFM639 groups. The Al exposure model was established by drinking water for the first 4 weeks. The strain was given after Al exposure by oral gavage at 109 colony-forming units once per day for 12 weeks. The results show that the Al binding ability of dead CCFM639 was similar to that of living CCFM639 in vitro. The ingestion of living or dead CCFM639 has similar effects on levels of Al and trace element in tissues, but living strains led to more significant amelioration of oxidative stress and improvement of memory deficits in Al-exposed mice. In conclusion, in addition to intestinal Al sequestration, CCFM639 treatment offers direct protection against chronic Al toxicity by alleviation of oxidative stress. Therefore, L. plantarum CCFM639 has a potential as dietary supplement ingredient that provides protection against Al-induced injury."

Here we integrated 1876 disease-gene associations of RE and located those genes to human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to obtain 42 significant RE-associated disease modules. The functional analysis of these disease modules showed novel molecular pathological mechanisms of RE, such as the novel enriched pathways (e.g., ""presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors"", ""signaling by insulin receptor""). Further analysis on the relationships between current drug targets and the RE-related disease genes showed the rational mechanisms of most antiepileptic drugs. In addition, we detected ten potential novel drug targets (e.g., KCNA1, KCNA4-6, KCNC3, KCND2, KCNMA1, CAMK2G, CACNB4 and GRM1) located in three RE related disease modules, which might provide novel insights into the new drug discovery for RE therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2604561423,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs which are produced throughout the body. Individual tissues tend to have a specific expression profile and excrete many of these miRNAs into circulation. These circulating miRNAs may be diagnostically valuable biomarkers for assessing the presence of disease while minimizing invasive testing. In women, numerous circulating miRNAs have been identified which change significantly during pregnancy-related complications (e.g. chorioamnionitis, eclampsia, recurrent pregnancy loss); however, no prior work has been done in this area in the horse. To identify pregnancy-specific miRNAs, we collected serial whole blood samples in pregnant mares at 8, 9, 10 m of gestation and post-partum, as well as from non-pregnant (diestrous) mares. In total, we evaluated a panel of 178 miRNAs using qPCR, eventually identifying five miRNAs of interest. One miRNA (miR-374b) was differentially regulated through late gestation and four miRNAs (miR-454, miR-133b, miR-486-5p and miR-204b) were differentially regulated between the pregnant and non-pregnant samples. We were able to identify putative targets for the differentially regulated miRNAs using two separate target prediction programs, miRDB and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The targets for the miRNAs differentially regulated during pregnancy were predicted to be involved in signaling pathways such as the STAT3 pathway and PI3/AKT signaling pathway, as well as more endocrine-based pathways, including the GnRH, prolactin and insulin signaling pathways. In summary, this study provides novel information about the changes occurring in circulating miRNAs during normal pregnancy, as well as attempting to predict the biological effects induced by these miRNAs."

https://openalex.org/W2604908404,"It is unclear how descending inputs from the vestibular system affect the excitability of cervical interneurons in humans. To elucidate this, we investigated the effects of galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) on the spatial facilitation of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by combined pyramidal tract and peripheral nerve stimulation. To assess the spatial facilitation, electromyograms were recorded from the biceps brachii muscles (BB) of healthy subjects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the contralateral primary motor cortex and electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral ulnar nerve at the wrist were delivered either separately or together, with interstimulus intervals of 10 ms (TMS behind). Anodal/cathodal GVS was randomly delivered with TMS and/or ulnar nerve stimulation. The combination of TMS and ulnar nerve stimulation facilitated BB MEPs significantly more than the algebraic summation of responses induced separately by TMS and ulnar nerve stimulation (i.e., spatial facilitation). MEP facilitation significantly increased when combined stimulation was delivered with GVS (p < 0.01). No significant differences were found between anodal and cathodal GVS. Furthermore, single motor unit recordings showed that the short-latency excitatory peak in peri-stimulus time histograms during combined stimulation increased significantly with GVS. The spatial facilitatory effects of combined stimulation with short interstimulus intervals (i.e., 10 ms) indicate that facilitation occurred at the premotoneuronal level in the cervical cord. The present findings therefore suggest that GVS facilitates the cervical interneuron system that integrates inputs from the pyramidal tract and peripheral nerves and excites motoneurons innervating the arm muscles."
https://openalex.org/W2604331109,"Legionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila. L. pneumophila pathogenicity relies on secretion of more than 300 effector proteins by a type IVb secretion system. Among these Legionella effectors, WipA has been primarily studied because of its dependence on a chaperone complex, IcmSW, for translocation through the secretion system, but its role in pathogenicity has remained unknown. In this study, we present the crystal structure of a large fragment of WipA, WipA435. Surprisingly, this structure revealed a serine/threonine phosphatase fold that unexpectedly targets tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides. The structure also revealed a sequence insertion that folds into an α-helical hairpin, the tip of which adopts a canonical coiled-coil structure. The purified protein was a dimer whose dimer interface involves interactions between the coiled coil of one WipA molecule and the phosphatase domain of another. Given the ubiquity of protein-protein interaction mediated by interactions between coiled-coils, we hypothesize that WipA can thereby transition from a homodimeric state to a heterodimeric state in which the coiled-coil region of WipA is engaged in a protein-protein interaction with a tyrosine-phosphorylated host target. In conclusion, these findings help advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of an effector involved in Legionella virulence and may inform approaches to elucidate the function of other effectors."
https://openalex.org/W2604494748,"Animal social behaviour can have important effects on the long-term dynamics of diseases. In particular, preferential spatial relationships between individuals can lead to differences in the rates of disease spread within a population. We examined the concurrent influence of genetic relatedness, sex, age, home range overlap, time of year, and prion disease status on proximal associations of adult Rocky Mountain mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus hemionus) in a chronic wasting disease endemic area. We also quantified the temporal stability of these associations across different sex, age, and disease status classes. We used three years of high frequency telemetry data from 74 individuals to record encounters within 25 m of each other, and to calculate seasonal home range overlap measured by volume of intersection (VI). The strength of pairwise spatial association between adult mule deer was independent of genetic relatedness, age and disease status. Seasonal variation in association strength was not consistent across years, perhaps due to annual changes in weather conditions. The influence of home range overlap on association strength varied seasonally, whereby associations were stronger in pre-rut and fawning than in the rest of the seasons. The sexes of individuals also interacted with both VI and season. At increasing levels of VI, associations were stronger between females than between males and between females and males. The strongest associations in pre-rut were between males, while the strongest in rut were between females and males. The temporal stability of associations was markedly dependant on the sex and the diagnosis of the associating pair. Our findings highlight the importance of considering concurrent effects of biological and environmental factors when seeking to understand the role of social preference in behavioural ecology and disease spread. Applying this knowledge in epidemiological modelling will shed light on the dynamics of disease transmission among mule deer."

Consequently, the introduction of a new Dengue virus serotype can trigger explosive epidemics in susceptible populations. The determination of clusters in this scenario can help to identify hotspots and understand the disease dispersion regardless of the influence of the population herd immunity. The present study evaluated the pattern and factors associated with dengue dispersion during the first epidemic related to Dengue virus serotype 4 in Vitória, Espírito Santo state, Brazil. Data on 18,861 dengue cases reported in Vitória from September 2012 to June 2013 were included in the study. The analysis of spatial variation in temporal trend was performed to detect clusters that were compared by their respective relative risk, house index, population density, and income in an ecological study. Overall, 11 clusters were detected. The time trend increase of dengue incidence in the overall study population was 636%. The five clusters that showed a lower time trend increase than the overall population presented a higher incidence in the beginning of the epidemic and, compared to the six clusters with higher time trend increase, they presented higher relative risk for their inhabitants to acquire dengue infection (P-value = 0.02) and a lower income (P-value <0.01). House index and population density did not differ between the clusters. Early increase of dengue incidence and higher relative risk for acquiring dengue infection were favored in low-income areas. Preventive actions and improvement of infrastructure in low-income areas should be prioritized in order to diminish the magnitude of dengue dispersion after the introduction of a new serotype."

Overall, the frequency for carriers of shorter GTn repeats in intron 2 of the TLR2 gene, which have previously been associated with low TLR2 expression and high IL-10 production, was slightly elevated in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis compared to healthy controls (16.0% resp. 16.7% vs. 12.8%). The highest frequency of short GTn carriers was noted among IBD patients on anti TNF-alpha therapy. However, none of these differences was significant in the multivariate analysis. The Arg753Gln polymorphism showed no association with any clinical subtype of IBD, including extensive colitis, for which such an association was previously described. We found no association with specific phenotypic disease subgroups. Also, epistasis analysis revealed no significant interactions between the two TLR2 variants and confirmed IBD susceptibility genes.The two functional relevant polymorphisms in TLR2, the GTn microsatellite repeat polymorphism in intron 2 and the Arg753Gln variant do not seem to play a role in the susceptibility to Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis."
https://openalex.org/W2604853387,"There is a significantly higher risk for type II diabetes in HIV-1 carriers, albeit the molecular mechanism for this HIV-related pathology remains enigmatic. The 52 amino acid HIV-1 p6 Gag protein is synthesized as the C-terminal part of the Gag polyprotein Pr55. In this context, p6 promotes virus release by its two late (L-) domains, and facilitates the incorporation of the viral accessory protein Vpr. However, the function of p6 in its mature form, after proteolytic release from Gag, has not been investigated yet. We found that the mature p6 represents the first known viral substrate of the ubiquitously expressed cytosolic metalloendopeptidase insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). IDE is sufficient and required for degradation of p6, and p6 is approximately 100-fold more efficiently degraded by IDE than its eponymous substrate insulin. This observation appears to be specific for HIV-1, as p6 proteins from HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus, as well as the 51 amino acid p9 from equine infectious anaemia virus were insensitive to IDE degradation. The amount of virus-associated p6, as well as the efficiency of release and maturation of progeny viruses does not depend on the presence of IDE in the host cells, as it was shown by CRISPR/Cas9 edited IDE KO cells. However, HIV-1 mutants harboring IDE-insensitive p6 variants exhibit reduced virus replication capacity, a phenomenon that seems to depend on the presence of an X4-tropic Env. Furthermore, competing for IDE by exogenous insulin or inhibiting IDE by the highly specific inhibitor 6bK, also reduced virus replication. This effect could be specifically attributed to IDE since replication of HIV-1 variants coding for an IDE-insensitive p6 were inert towards IDE-inhibition. Our cumulative data support a model in which removal of p6 during viral entry is important for virus replication, at least in the case of X4 tropic HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2604541447,"It has been demonstrated that optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) gain increases through attention to peripheral motion when the central visual field is occluded. However, how the properties of OKN change when two areas containing motion in different directions are presented in the peripheral visual field is still unclear. In this study, we investigated whether OKN corresponding to the attended motion in the periphery occurred while the observer was maintaining fixation at the center. We presented two areas with different directions of motion arranged on the left and right, top and bottom, or center and surrounding (concentric) areas in the display. Observers counted targets appearing on the attended area in the stimulus to maintain their attention on it. The results indicate that attention enhances the gain and frequency of OKN corresponding to the attended motion even in the case of stimuli having several areas with different directions of motion."

Our aim was to investigate whether Fetuin-A plays a direct role in the neuroinflammatory response in the mouse EAE model. Peak Fetuin-A expression in the CNS and in peripheral lymphoid tissue correlated with peak EAE disease activity. Fetuin-A-deficient mice showed reduced EAE severity associated with an accumulation of splenic monocyte and dendritic cell populations, increased IL-12p40, ASC1, and IL-1β expression, and an increase in T regulatory cells. The upregulation of Fetuin-A in LPS-stimulated dendritic cells and microglia further supports an intrinsic role of Fetuin-A in regulating innate immune activation during EAE."
https://openalex.org/W2604870149,"Cholesterol oxidase (COase) is a bacterial enzyme catalyzing the first step in the biodegradation of cholesterol. COase is an important biotechnological tool for clinical diagnostics and production of steroid drugs and insecticides. It is also used for tracking intracellular cholesterol; however, its utility is limited by the lack of an efficient temporal control of its activity. To overcome this we have developed a regulatable fragment complementation system for COase cloned from Chromobacterium sp. The enzyme was split into two moieties that were fused to FKBP (FK506-binding protein) and FRB (rapamycin-binding domain) pair and split GFP fragments. The addition of rapamycin reconstituted a fluorescent enzyme, termed split GFP-COase, the fluorescence level of which correlated with its oxidation activity. A rapid decrease of cellular cholesterol induced by intracellular expression of the split GFP-COase promoted the dissociation of a cholesterol biosensor D4H from the plasma membrane. The process was reversible as upon rapamycin removal, the split GFP-COase fluorescence was lost, and cellular cholesterol levels returned to normal.

These data demonstrate that the split GFP-COase provides a novel tool to manipulate cholesterol in mammalian cells. Cholesterol is an essential component of the eukaryotic cell plasma membrane and is critical for its structural integrity (1Ikonen E. Cellular cholesterol trafficking and compartmentalization.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 125-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). It is derived either exogenously or synthesized endogenously in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 4The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumPMplasma membraneHMG CoA3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme ACOasecholesterol oxidasePPIprotein-protein interactionFRBrapamycin-binding domain of kinase mammalian target of rapamycinFKBPFK506-binding proteinFPfluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced GFPsfGFPsuper-folder GFPLPDSlipoprotein-deficient serumSREBP-2sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2CTthreshold cyclePOPE1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamineDOPC1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. A continuous flow of cholesterol from the ER to the plasma membrane (PM) results in an intracellular gradient of cholesterol with the majority of cholesterol (60–70%) localized in the PM (2Wüstner D. Solanko K. How cholesterol interacts with proteins and lipids during its intracellular transport.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1848: 1908-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the PM, cholesterol is able to associate with saturated phospholipids and sphingolipids, forming membrane nanodomains (3Lingwood D. Simons K. Lipid rafts as a membrane-organizing principle.Science. 2010; 327: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). These structures, called lipid rafts, are enriched e.g. in signal transduction molecules (4Simons K. Toomre D. Lipid rafts and signal transduction.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5149) Google Scholar). endoplasmic reticulum plasma membrane 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A cholesterol oxidase protein-protein interaction rapamycin-binding domain of kinase mammalian target of rapamycin FK506-binding protein fluorescent protein enhanced GFP super-folder GFP lipoprotein-deficient serum sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 threshold cycle 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. Several compounds such as statins, filipin, and cyclodextrins can be used to manipulate cellular cholesterol. Statins inhibit the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis (5Demierre M.F. Higgins P.D. Gruber S.B. Hawk E. Lippman S.M. Statins and cancer prevention.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 930-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Filipin is a cholesterol-binding fluorescent antibiotic that permeabilizes membranes (6Börnig H. Geyer G. Staining of cholesterol with the fluorescent antibiotic “filipin.”.Acta Histochem. 1974; 50: 110-115PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclodextrins form soluble complexes with cholesterol and can be used to extract cholesterol from or deliver cholesterol to membranes (7Zidovetzki R. Levitan I. Use of cyclodextrins to manipulate plasma membrane cholesterol content: evidence, misconceptions, and control strategies.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 1311-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Another commonly used method to manipulate cholesterol levels is treatment of cells with cholesterol oxidase (COase) (8Lange Y. Tracking cell cholesterol with cholesterol oxidase.J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 315-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme also has multiple biotechnological applications, including clinical diagnostics of cholesterol content and production of sterol drugs and insecticides (9Pollegioni L. Piubelli L. Molla G. Cholesterol oxidase: biotechnological applications.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 6857-6870Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Bacteria produce COases to utilize cholesterol for their energy metabolism, which is initiated by a multistep oxidation reaction. First, the FAD cofactor accepts hydride from cholesterol. Then the reduced flavin reacts with dioxygen to generate peroxide and re-oxidizes the enzyme. Finally, oxidized cholesterol isomerizes to a final product, cholest-4en-3-one (10Vrielink A. Ghisla S. Cholesterol oxidase: biochemistry and structural features.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 6826-6843Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cholesterol oxidases bind to FAD either non-covalently (class 1) or covalently (class 2). Classes differ in the kinetics of the oxidation reaction, class 2 being faster than class 1 (11Gadda G. Wels G. Pollegioni L. Zucchelli S. Ambrosius D. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Characterization of cholesterol oxidase from Streptomyces hygroscopicus and Brevibacterium sterolicum.Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Both classes are described as being composed of two functional domains: the FAD-binding domain and the cholesterol-binding domain. Topologically they can also be considered as single domain proteins as the polypeptide chain meanders back and forth. The class 1 enzymes possess the typical Rossman fold found in nucleotide-binding proteins (12Yue Q.K. Kass I.J. Sampson N.S. Vrielink A. Crystal structure determination of cholesterol oxidase from Streptomyces and structural characterization of key active site mutants.Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4277-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The class 2 enzymes belong to the vanillyl-alcohol oxidase family (13Sagermann M. Ohtaki A. Newton K. Doukyu N. Structural characterization of the organic solvent-stable cholesterol oxidase from Chromobacterium sp. DS-1.J. Struct. Biol. 2010; 170: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 14Coulombe R. Yue K.Q. Ghisla S. Vrielink A. Oxygen access to the active site of cholesterol oxidase through a narrow channel is gated by an Arg-Glu pair.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30435-30441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In both classes FAD and cholesterol are buried from the solvent inside the enzyme, although the nature of the binding pockets is different (10Vrielink A. Ghisla S. Cholesterol oxidase: biochemistry and structural features.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 6826-6843Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The effect of COase on the cell membrane is profound, as it rapidly converts membrane cholesterol to cholestenone. In cholestenone, the initial hydroxyl group is converted to a keto group that has limited capacity for hydrogen bonding with other plasma membrane components. This increases the flip-flop rate of cholestenone that is in the order of magnitude higher than that for cholesterol (15Neuvonen M. Manna M. Mokkila S. Javanainen M. Rog T. Liu Z. Bittman R. Vattulainen I. Ikonen E. Enzymatic oxidation of cholesterol: properties and functional effects of cholestenone in cell membranes.PloS ONE. 2014; 9e103743Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). COase treatment also decreases membrane order because of cholesterol lowering and the disordering effect of cholestenone. Raft disruption leads to a spontaneous clustering of death factor Fas, formation of Fas-FADD complexes, activation of caspase-8, and apoptosis (16Gniadecki R. Depletion of membrane cholesterol causes ligand-independent activation of Fas and apoptosis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). An additional cytotoxic effect is caused by peroxide that increases the intracellular reactive oxygen species level (17Liu J. Xian G. Li M. Zhang Y. Yang M. Yu Y. Lv H. Xuan S. Lin Y. Gao L. Cholesterol oxidase from Bordetella species promotes irreversible cell apoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma by cholesterol oxidation.Cell Death Dis. 2014; 5e1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Despite that, a lysosome-targeted COase has been reported to attenuate the cytotoxicity of 7-ketocholesterol in human fibroblasts (18Mathieu J.M. Wang F. Segatori L. Alvarez P.J. Increased resistance to oxysterol cytotoxicity in fibroblasts transfected with a lysosomally targeted Chromobacterium oxidase.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2012; 109: 2409-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, COase activity influences multiple cellular processes. Reconstitution of enzymatic activity through the noncovalent association of complementing fragments has been widely used to monitor dynamic protein-protein interactions (PPI) and to discover drugs modifying them (19Wehr M.C. Rossner M.J. Split protein biosensor assays in molecular pharmacological studies.Drug Discov. Today. 2016; 21: 415-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Development of split GFP and other fluorescent proteins enabled the visualization of PPI in a wide variety of organisms (20Kodama Y. Hu C.D. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC): a 5-year update and future perspectives.Biotechniques. 2012; 53: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Recently, a split horseradish peroxidase was developed to detect PPI in the extracellular space for studying communication between different cell types (21Martell J.D. Yamagata M. Deerinck T.J. Phan S. Kwa C.G. Ellisman M.H. Sanes J.R. Ting A.Y. A split horseradish peroxidase for the detection of intercellular protein-protein interactions and sensitive visualization of synapses.Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34: 774-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Beyond that, complementing fragments are used in chemically induced dimerizers to restore enzymatic activity and trigger biological responses. In this case one fragment of an enzyme is fused with FRB (rapamycin-binding domain of kinase mammalian target of rapamycin) and the other with FKBP (FK506-binding protein), which form a pair upon the addition of rapamycin, reconstituting the functional enzyme (22Fegan A.

Ghosh I. Split-protein systems: beyond binary protein-protein interactions.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2011; 15: 789-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). For example, split Cre and Cas9 nucleases are versatile tools for genome editing and transcriptional regulation (24Zetsche B. Volz S.E. Zhang F. A split-Cas9 architecture for inducible genome editing and transcription modulation.Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 25Jullien N. Sampieri F.

Schwartz E.C. Muir T.W. Small-molecule-mediated rescue of protein function by an inducible proteolytic shunt.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 28Gray D.C. Mahrus S. Wells J.A. Activation of specific apoptotic caspases with an engineered small-molecule-activated protease.Cell. 2010; 142: 637-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Additionally, splitting may increase spatiotemporal precision of enzymatic reactions and make them tissue-specific (24Zetsche B. Volz S.E. Zhang F. A split-Cas9 architecture for inducible genome editing and transcription modulation.Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 29Davis K.M. Pattanayak V.

In this study we engineered a rapamycin-inducible fluorescent cholesterol oxidase from Chromobacterium sp. DS-1 (split GFP-COase) that belongs to class 2 of COase enzymes (13Sagermann M. Ohtaki A. Newton K. Doukyu N. Structural characterization of the organic solvent-stable cholesterol oxidase from Chromobacterium sp. DS-1.J. Struct. Biol. 2010; 170: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 30Doukyu N. Shibata K. Ogino H. Sagermann M. Cloning, sequence analysis, and expression of a gene encoding Chromobacterium sp. DS-1 cholesterol oxidase.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2009; 82: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Induction by rapamycin allows temporal control over COase activity and rapidly leads to an efficient reduction of intracellular cholesterol. After rapamycin removal, the cells loose the holoenzyme expression and recover their cholesterol levels. We propose this drug-inducible split GFP-COase as a new tool to manipulate the cellular cholesterol content and gain insights into cholesterol-dependent proteins and cholesterol-related cell pathologies. COase from Chromobacterium sp. strain DS-1 is composed of 21 α-helices and 20 β-strands that form four structural domains (13Sagermann M. Ohtaki A. Newton K. Doukyu N. Structural characterization of the organic solvent-stable cholesterol oxidase from Chromobacterium sp. DS-1.J. Struct. Biol. 2010; 170: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We used two approaches to find successful sites for the split of the COase. Assuming that protein domains fold independently, we decided on three split sites that would separate entire domains and may complement in restoring enzymatic activity (Fig. 1A). Our second approach was to split COase in the loops with maximum flexibility. We chose several loop regions with maximal temperature B-factor that reflects their maximal mobility (Fig. 1A) (13Sagermann M. Ohtaki A. Newton K. Doukyu N. Structural characterization of the organic solvent-stable cholesterol oxidase from Chromobacterium sp. DS-1.J. Struct. Biol. 2010; 170: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Presumably, splitting at these sites should preserve α-helices and β-sheets as well as bind to FAD and cholesterol. We first tested the activity of split COase in bacteria, co-expressing both fragments from a single plasmid. To induce complementation of the separated N- and C-terminal fragments, they were fused to coils with oppositely charged amino acid residues (named E-coil and K-coil). These coils electrostatically interact with each other with high affinity (31De Crescenzo G. Litowski J.R. Hodges R.S. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Real-time monitoring of the interactions of two-stranded de novo designed coiled-coils: effect of chain length on the kinetic and thermodynamic constants of binding.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1754-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and bring COase fragments together, restoring their enzymatic activity. COase activity in bacterial extracts was detected for the constructs split at positions 75, 95, 415, and 485 (Fig. 2A). Notably, all these splits located in close proximity to N-terminal or C-terminal ends of the protein. The most active split at the position 485 had a 20-fold lower enzymatic activity than the full-length enzyme. The remaining active constructs (splits at positions 75, 95, and 415) were even less active. This result was expected because splitting may decrease solubility and destabilize protein structure. Importantly, no enzymatic activity was detected when only one COase part was expressed in the cells (data not shown). We further tested four splits with maximum activity (75, 95, 415, 485) in mammalian cells. For this purpose we fused the N-terminal COase part with FRB and the respective C-terminal part with membrane-targeted FKBP constructs (Fig. 2B). COase activity was only detected in splits 75 and 95, whereas splits 415 and 485 were inactive in HeLa cell lysates (Fig. 2C). COase activity in splits 75 and 95, however, was detected even in the absence of rapamycin (Fig. 2C). Detection of COase activity in living mammalian cells requires incubation of cells with dichlorofluorescin diacetate, which does not react directly with peroxide but with hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction (32Karlsson M. Kurz T. Brunk U.T. Nilsson S.E. Frennesson C.I. What does the commonly used DCF test for oxidative stress really show?.The Biochemical journal. 2010; 428: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Therefore, dichlorofluorescin diacetate-dependent fluorescence reflects the release of redox-active metals from lysosomes or cytochrome c from mitochondria rather than accumulation of peroxide. A better detection method would involve the co-transfection of cells with HyPer peroxidase biosensor (33Belousov V.V. Fradkov A.F. Lukyanov K.A. Staroverov D.B. Shakhbazov K.S. Terskikh A.V. Lukyanov S. Genetically encoded fluorescent indicator for intracellular hydrogen peroxide.Nature methods. 2006; 3: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), but this biosensor is very pH-sensitive, posing another drawback. To avoid these obstacles, we decided to monitor COase activity by generating chimera of the COase fragments fused to split-halves of a fluorescent protein (FP). Consequently, fusion of the COase fragments would induce fluorescence and allow the detection of cells expressing the active COase by microscopy and cell sorting. Thus, we fused the COase parts with rapamycin-inducible split EGFP constructs (Fig. 2D). The addition of EGFP parts only slightly decreased the enzymatic activity of both 75 and 95 splits. More importantly, the fusion of the EGFP parts to split 95 abolished background activity in the absence of rapamycin (Fig. 2E). This effect might be explained by the lower amount of expressed protein and increased solubility of the chimeric constructs. In conclusion, the split 95 COase fragments (split-EGFP COase) generated the most promising combination to allow efficient control of COase enzymatic activity by rapamycin induction. To investigate the kinetics of split-EGFP COase reconstitution in living HeLa cells, we induced cells continuously with rapamycin and analyzed them by flow cytometry. Unexpectedly, the EGFP signal was barely detected by flow cytometry and was too dim to be detected by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3, A and B). This is explained by the very low amount of reconstituted split-EGFP COase as shown in Fig. 3C. To increase construct brightness, we replaced parts of EGFP with the corresponding fragments of super-folder GFP (sfGFP) (Fig. 3A), which has been shown to fold very efficiently with a high chromophore formation rate (34Pédelacq J.D. Cabantous S. Tran T. Terwilliger T.C. Waldo G.S. Engineering and characterization of a superfolder green fluorescent protein.Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). However, a split sfGFP construct gave a strong fluorescent signal even in the absence of rapamycin due to spontaneous self-association of the complementing fragments (Fig. 3B). This self-association was eliminated by using a pair that contained the N-terminal fragment of sfGFP and C-terminal fragment of EGFP (Fig. 3, A and B). This construct, termed split GFP-COase, possessed the same brightness as sfGFP after 4 h of continuous induction but was practically undetectable in the absence of rapamycin (0 h) (Fig. 3, B and C). Both the protein amount of the complemented split GFP-COase chimera and its COase activity increased linearly after induction, reflecting a constant rate of protein synthesis (Fig. 4, A–C). Finally, we compared the enzymatic activity of split GFP-COase with full-length EGFP-COase. The specific activity (ratio of resorufin to GFP fluorescence) of split GFP-COase was about half that of the full-length enzyme (Fig. 4D). We next studied the intracellular distribution of split COase in transfected HeLa cells after 2 and 4 h of rapamycin induction. Split GFP-COase was rather uniformly distributed over the cytoplasm and was not detected in the nucleus, in contrast to split EGFP control that was found in both cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 5, A and B). The absence of cytoplasmic aggregation suggested correct folding of the protein. Exclusion of split GFP-COase from the nucleus indicated that the chimeric protein exceeds the diffusion limit of nuclear pores. To determine the amount of oxidized cholesterol, we stained rapamycin-induced cells with filipin. This fluorescent antibiotic detects both plasma membrane and endomembrane pools of cholesterol and allows their quantification in fixed cells (35Pörn M.I. Slotte J.P. Localization of cholesterol in sphingomyelinase-treated fibroblasts.Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Upon the induction of split GFP-COase, filipin largely disappeared from the plasma membrane region within 2 h, whereas intracellular accumulation still remained intense (Fig. 5A). This remaining signal corresponded to ∼40% of filipin intensity compared with control cells expressing split EGFP (Fig. 5C). Within 4 h of induction, filipin almost totally disappeared from cells with the highest level of split GFP-COase expression (Fig. 5B), with the average remaining signal being ∼20% (Fig. 5C). Because the binding of filipin to residual cholesterol can be blocked by some membrane components (36McGookey D.J. Fagerberg K. Anderson R.G. Filipin-cholesterol complexes form in uncoated vesicle membrane derived from coated vesicles during receptor-mediated endocytosis of low density lipoprotein.J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1273-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we confirmed this finding by biochemical cholesterol determination. We sorted cells expressing split GFP-COase using FACS and extracted lipids and analyzed them by thin layer chromatography (TLC). This verified that the cholesterol amount of the COase-expressing cells was about half that in split-EGFP transfected or non-transfected cells after 2 h of rapamycin induction (Fig. 5D; supplemental Fig. S1). To assess if intra-endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol is protected from oxidation, we incubated split GFP-COase-expressing cells with U18666A, an inhibitor of the late endosomal cholesterol transporter NPC1 (37Lu F. Liang Q. Abi-Mosleh L. Das A. De Brabander J.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Identification of NPC1 as the target of U18666A, an inhibitor of lysosomal cholesterol export and Ebola infection.eLife. 2015; 4e12177Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This resulted in a filipin-staining pattern typical of storage lysosomes (Fig. 5E) and elevated filipin intensity compared with control split GFP-COase-expressing cells (Fig. 5F). This suggests that the enzyme did not access intra-endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol. The accumulation of cholestenone is highly toxic to cells and organisms (38Bernheimer A.W. Robinson W.G. Linder R. Mullins D. Yip Y.K. Cooper N.S. Seidman I. Uwajima T. Toxicity of enzymically-oxidized low-density lipoprotein.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In most cells lipids are distributed asymmetrically in the plasma membrane, with phosphatidylserine found in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (39Op den Kamp J.A. Lipid asymmetry in membranes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 47-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Upon induction of apoptosis, phosphatidylserine becomes translocated to the outer surface of the membrane and exposed to annexin V (40Koopman G. Reutelingsperger C.P. Kuijten G.A. Keehnen R.M.

To assess the effect of cholesterol oxidation on phosphatidylserine exposure, we stained split GFP-COase-expressing CHO cells with annexin V and propidium iodide (41Kuypers F.A. Lewis R.A. Hua M. Schott M.A. Discher D. Ernst J.D. Lubin B.H. Detection of altered membrane phospholipid asymmetry in subpopulations of human red blood cells using fluorescently labeled annexin V.Blood. 1996; 87: 1179-1187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells expressing split GFP-COase showed a time-dependent increase in the fraction of annexin V- and propidium iodide-positive cells compared to control split EGFP cells (Fig. 6). These results suggest that COase expression changes membrane asymmetry and enhances apoptosis over time. The precise mechanism(s) involved remains to be elucidated, but the rapid flip-flop and membrane-disordering effects of cholestenone (15Neuvonen M. Manna M. Mokkila S. Javanainen M. Rog T. Liu Z. Bittman R. Vattulainen I. Ikonen E. Enzymatic oxidation of cholesterol: properties and functional effects of cholestenone in cell membranes.PloS ONE. 2014; 9e103743Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) may contribute to phosphatidylserine translocation. Analysis of split GFP-COase showed that it rapidly and efficiently reduces cellular cholesterol in a few hours after induction. The longer the COase is active, the more cells become apoptotic. To evaluate the potential recovery of cholesterol levels after a short oxidation by split GFP-COase, we pulsed transfected HeLa cells with rapamycin for 30 min, washed it out, and then continued cultivation in the absence of the drug. The intensity of the green signal of split GFP-COase increased rapidly and linearly reached its maximum at 2 h, followed by an exponential decrease. The calculated half-life time of split GFP-COase complex was 6 h (Fig. 7A). For control cells expressing split EGFP the mean cell brightness was ∼5-fold higher than for split GFP-COase-expressing cells (Fig. 7B). In addition, the intensity of the green signal of split EGFP increased and decreased more slowly than of the split GFP-COase. The half-life time of split EGFP was 12 h, i.e. double that of split GFP-COase (Fig. 7B). These findings suggested that the GFP-COase complex is less stable than the EGFP complex, and the formation of the GFP-COase complex might destabilize the enzyme. Consequently, this property might allow cells to restore their cholesterol level once split GFP-COase dissociates and/or is degraded in the cells. To investigate this hypothesis, we followed the cholesterol levels of HeLa cells after short rapamycin induction of the split GFP-COase by filipin staining. We observed a rapid decrease of filipin staining already at 2 h after the rapamycin pulse that correlated with the formation of the GFP-COase complex and the increase in green fluorescence (Fig. 7C). Filipin intensity was minimal between 2 and 6 h. After 6 h, the filipin signal started to gradually recover, reaching half of the initial level at 24 h and a full recovery at 48 h of chase. This corresponded to almost total disappearance of green fluorescence (Fig. 7, A–D). These data indicate that a short pulse of rapamycin causes rapid cholesterol oxidation within few hours, whereas replenishment of cholesterol levels is a slower process. Notably, the transfected cells remained viable until the end of the experiment and restored their cholesterol content (Fig. 7D). To study the mechanisms by which the cells regain cholesterol, we performed the chase after short split GFP-COase induction in DMEM with 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS). Under these conditions, cells rely on endo"

Whether certain factors can predict if patients will benefit more from implantation of CRT pacemakers (CRT-P) or CRT defibrillators (CRT-D) remains unclear.We followed 305 primary prevention CRT-D recipients for the two primary outcomes of HF hospitalization and ICD therapy for VAs. Serum biomarkers, electrocardiographic and clinical variables were collected prior to implant. Multivariable analysis using Cox-proportional hazards model was used to fit the final models. Among 282 patients with follow-up outcome data, 75 (26.6%) were hospitalized for HF and 31 (11%) received appropriate ICD therapy. Independent predictors of HF hospitalization were atrial fibrillation (HR = 1.8 (1.1,2.9)), NYHA class III/IV (HR = 2.2 (1.3,3.6)), ejection fraction <20% (HR = 1.7 (1.1,2.7)), HS-IL6 >4.03pg/ml (HR = 1.7 (1.1,2.9)) and hemoglobin (<12g/dl) (HR = 2.2 (1.3,3.6)). Independent predictors of appropriate therapy included BUN >20mg/dL (HR = 3.0 (1.3,7.1)), HS-CRP >9.42mg/L (HR = 2.3 (1.1,4.7)), no beta blocker therapy (HR = 3.2 (1.4,7.1)) and hematocrit ≥38% (HR = 2.7 (1.03,7.0)). Patients with 0-1 risk factors for appropriate therapy (IR 1 per 100 person-years) and ≥3 risk factors for HF hospitalization (IR 23 per 100-person-years) were more likely to die prior to receiving an appropriate ICD therapy.Clinical and biomarker data can risk stratify CRT patients for HF progression and VAs. These findings may help characterize subgroups of patients that may benefit more from the use of CRT-P vs. CRT-D systems.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00733590."
https://openalex.org/W2604579851,"Asians have higher frequency of intracranial arterial stenosis. The present study aimed to compare the clinical features and outcomes of ischemic stroke patients with and without middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis, assessed by transcranial sonography (TCS), based on the Taiwan Stroke Registry (TSR).Patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack registered in the TSR, and received both carotid duplex and TCS assessment were categorized into those with stenosis (≥50%) and without (<50%) in the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) and MCA, respectively. Logistic regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model were applied to assess relevant variables between groups.Of 6003 patients, 23.3% had MCA stenosis, 10.1% ICA stenosis, and 3.9% both MCA and ICA stenosis. Patients with MCA stenosis had greater initial NIHSS, higher likelihood of stroke-in-evolution, and more severe disability than those without (all p<0.001). Patients with MCA stenosis had higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. Patients with combined MCA and extracranial ICA stenosis had even higher NIHSS, worse functional outcome, higher risk of stroke recurrence or death (hazard ratio, 2.204; 95% confidence intervals, 1.440-3.374; p<0.001) at 3 months after stroke than those without MCA stenosis.In conclusion, MCA stenosis was more prevalent than extracranial ICA stenosis in ischemic stroke patients in Taiwan. Patients with MCA stenosis, especially combined extracranial ICA stenosis, had more severe neurological deficit and worse outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2605241575,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is a type of relatively rare neoplasm in adenocarcinoma. The characteristics of CCs as well as biliary epithelial cells are heterogeneous at the different portion of the biliary tree. There are two candidate stem/progenitor cells of the biliary tree, i.e., biliary tree stem/progenitor cell (BTSC) at the peribiliary gland (PBG) of large bile ducts and liver stem/progenitor cell (LPC) at the canals of Hering of peripheral small bile duct. Although previous reports suggest that intrahepatic CC (ICC) can arise from such stem/progenitor cells, the characteristic difference between BTSC and LPC in pathological process needs further investigation, and the etiology of CC remains poorly understood. Here we show that Sterile alpha motif domain containing 5 (SAMD5) is exclusively expressed in PBGs of large bile ducts in normal mice. Using a mouse model of cholestatic liver disease, we demonstrated that SAMD5 expression was upregulated in the large bile duct at the hepatic hilum, the extrahepatic bile duct and PBGs, but not in proliferating intrahepatic ductules, suggesting that SAMD5 is expressed in BTSC but not LPC. Intriguingly, human ICCs and extrahepatic CCs exhibited striking nuclear localization of SAMD5 while the normal hilar large bile duct displayed slight-to-moderate expression in cytoplasm. In vitro experiments using siRNA for SAMD5 revealed that SAMD5 expression was associated with the cell cycle regulation of CC cell lines.SAMD5 is a novel marker for PBG but not LPC in mice. In humans, the expression and location of SAMD5 could become a promising diagnostic marker for the cell type as well as malignancy of bile ducts and CCs."
https://openalex.org/W2604182578,"In the past decade, the federal government has frequently investigated and prosecuted pharmaceutical manufacturers for illegal promotion of drugs for indications not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (“off-label” uses). State governments can choose to coordinate with the federal investigation, or pursue their own independent state investigations. One of the largest-ever off-label prosecutions relates to the atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine (Zyprexa). In a series of settlements between 2008 and 2010, Eli Lilly paid $1.4 billion to the federal government and over $290 million to state governments. We examined the effect of these settlements on off-label prescribing of this medication, taking advantage of geographical differences in states’ involvement in the investigations and the timing of the settlements. However, we did not find a reduction in off-label prescribing; rather, there were no prescribing changes among states that joined the federal investigation, those that pursued independent state investigations, and states that pursued no investigations at all. Since the settlements of state investigations of off-label prescribing do not appear to significantly impact prescribing rates, policymakers should consider alternate ways of reducing the prevalence of non-evidence-based off-label use to complement their ongoing investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2605293469,"Ribosome synthesis is an essential process in all cells. In Sacharomyces cerevisiae, the precursor rRNA, 35S pre-rRNA, is folded and assembled into a 90S pre-ribosomal complex. The 40S ribosomal subunit is processed from the pre-ribosomal complex. This requires concerted action of small nucleolar RNAs, such as U3 snoRNA, and a large number of trans-acting factors. Mrd1p, one of the essential small ribosomal subunit synthesis factors is required for cleavage of the 35S pre-rRNA to generate 18S rRNA of the small ribosomal subunit. Mrd1p is evolutionary conserved in all eukaryotes and in yeast it contains five RNA Binding Domains (RBDs) separated by linker regions. One of these linkers, Linker 2 between RBD2 and RBD3, is conserved in length, predicted to be structured and contains conserved clusters of amino acid residues. In this report, we have analysed Linker 2 mutations and demonstrate that it is essential for Mrd1p function during pre-ribosomal processing. Extensive changes of amino acid residues as well as specific changes of conserved clusters of amino acid residues were found to be incompatible with synthesis of pre-40S ribosomes and cell growth. In addition, gross changes in primary sequence of Linker 2 resulted in Mrd1p instability, leading to degradation of the N-terminal part of the protein. Our data indicates that Linker 2 is functionally coupled to RBD2 and argues for that these domains constitute a functional module in Mrd1p. We conclude that Linker 2 has an essential role for Mrd1p beyond just providing a defined length between RBD2 and RBD3."

The present study aimed to put some well-known effects from the impression formation literature to a test in a more dynamic computerized environment, more akin to many real world impression formation scenarios. In three studies participants were introduced to multiple target persons. They were given information about the target persons' behavior, one at a time, while making ratings of their warmth and competence, and their probability of performing related behaviors in the future. In neither of the studies the negativity effect of warmth or the positivity effect of competence were reproduced."
