Maintaining low levels of cytoplasmic sodium requires the coordinate regulation of transport proteins on numerous cellular membranes. Our previous studies have linked components of the Salt-Overly-Sensitive pathway (SOS1-3) to salt tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana and demonstrated that the activity of the plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger (SOS1) is regulated by SOS2 (a protein kinase) and SOS3 (a calcium-binding protein). Current studies were undertaken to determine if the Na+/H+ exchanger in the vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) of Arabidopsis is also a target for the SOS regulatory pathway. Characterization of tonoplast Na+/H+ exchange demonstrated that it represents activity originating from the AtNHX proteins since it could be inhibited by 5-(N-methyl-N-isobutyl)amiloride and by anti-NHX1 antibodies. Transport activity was selective for sodium (apparent Km = 31 mm) and electroneutral (one sodium ion for each proton). When compared with tonoplast Na+/H+-exchange activity in wild type, activity was significantly higher, greatly reduced, and unchanged in sos1, sos2, and sos3, respectively. Activated SOS2 protein added in vitro increased tonoplast Na+/H+-exchange activity in vesicles isolated from sos2 but did not have any effect on activity in vesicles isolated from wild type, sos1, or sos3. These results demonstrate that (i) the tonoplast Na+/H+ exchanger in Arabidopsis is a target of the SOS regulatory pathway, (ii) there are branches to the SOS pathway, and (iii) there may be coordinate regulation of the exchangers in the tonoplast and plasma membrane.

In order to avoid the adverse effects of salt stress on growth and development, plants have developed mechanisms to maintain low levels of salt in the cytoplasm (1.Schachtman D. Liu W.

Biol. 2000; 51: 463-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (3571) Google Scholar). One mechanism involves removal of sodium (Na+) from the cytoplasm by transport into the vacuole or out of the cell. This transport is catalyzed by Na+/H+ exchangers (antiporters), membrane proteins localized in either the vacuolar (tonoplast) or plasma membrane (2.Hasegawa P.M. Bressan R.A. Zhu J.-K. Bohnert H.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 463-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (3571) Google Scholar, 3.Blumwald E. Curr. Opin.

Na+/H+-exchange activity is driven by the electrochemical gradient of protons (H+) generated by the H+-pumps such as the plasma membrane H+-ATPase or the tonoplast H+-ATPase and H+-pyrophosphatase (4.Blumwald E. Aharon G.S. Apse M.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Recently, the molecular identity of a plant plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger and one mechanism underlying its regulation have been reported (5.Qiu Q.S. Guo Y. Dietrich M.A. Schumaker K.S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8436-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). In a genetic screen designed to identify components of the cellular machinery that contributes to salt tolerance in Arabidopsis, three salt-overly-sensitive mutants (sos1, sos2, and sos3) 1The abbreviations used are: sos, salt-overly-sensitive; ΔpH, pH gradient; ΔΨ, electrical or membrane potential; MIA, 5-(N-methyl-N-isobutyl)amiloride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: sos, salt-overly-sensitive; ΔpH, pH gradient; ΔΨ, electrical or membrane potential; MIA, 5-(N-methyl-N-isobutyl)amiloride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. were characterized (6.Liu J.

Mutations in SOS1 rendered Arabidopsis extremely sensitive to growth in high levels of NaCl (7.Zhu J.-K. Liu J. Xiong L. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1181-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 13.Wu S.-J. Lei D. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 617-627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as these plants accumulated more Na+ than wild-type plants (11.Shi H. Ishitani M. Kim C. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6896-6901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrated that SOS1 encodes a plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger (5.Qiu Q.S. Guo Y. Dietrich M.A. Schumaker K.S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8436-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 11.Shi H. Ishitani M. Kim C. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6896-6901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). (i) The predicted SOS1 protein sequence shares significant sequence and domain homology with plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchangers from animal, bacterial, and fungal cells (11.Shi H. Ishitani M. Kim C. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6896-6901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). (ii) When the SOS1 gene was expressed in cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with mutations in endogenous Na+ transporters, growth in NaCl was restored as Na+ content decreased (14.Shi H. Quintero F.J. Pardo J.M. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). (iii) Studies with SOS1-GFP fusion protein (14.Shi H. Quintero F.J. Pardo J.M. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar) and anti-SOS1 antibody (15.Qiu Q.-S. Barkla B.J. Vera-Estrella R. Zhu J.-K. Schumaker K.S. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) have shown that SOS1 localizes to the plasma membrane. (iv) SOS1 Na+/H+-exchange activity was demonstrated using plasma membrane vesicles (5.Qiu Q.S. Guo Y. Dietrich M.A. Schumaker K.S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8436-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). This Na+/H+-exchange activity was induced by salt stress, was specific for and had a low affinity for Na+ and exchanged one Na+ for each H+ (15.Qiu Q.-S. Barkla B.J. Vera-Estrella R. Zhu J.-K. Schumaker K.S. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The molecular identities of other known components of the SOS regulatory pathway have also been determined (12.Zhu J.-K. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). SOS2 is a serine/threonine kinase with a catalytic domain similar to the yeast SNF1 and the mammalian AMPK kinases (10.Liu J. Ishitani M. Halfter U. Kim C. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3730-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The kinase domain in SOS2 has been localized to the N terminus of the protein; while a regulatory domain that inhibits kinase activity has been identified in the C-terminal portion of the protein (16.Guo Y. Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). SOS3 is a Ca2+-binding protein that contains EF-hand domains in the C terminus and a myristoylation site in the N-terminal portion of the protein (6.Liu J. Zhu J.-K. Science. 1998; 280: 1943-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Molecular genetic and biochemical studies have demonstrated that SOS2 and SOS3 are part of a novel signal transduction pathway involved in the perception and transduction of salt stress signals in the plant. (i) The phenotypes of sos2 and sos3 mutant plants are similar, suggesting that the two genes function in the same pathway to regulate Na+/K+ homeostasis (7.Zhu J.-K. Liu J. Xiong L. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1181-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). (ii) Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays have shown that the SOS2 protein kinase physically interacts with and is activated by SOS3 in the presence of Ca2+ (8.Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3735-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The SOS3 binding site has been localized to a 21-amino acid motif (FISL) within the regulatory domain of the SOS2 protein. When Thr168 in the activation loop of the SOS2 kinase domain was changed to Asp, the kinase was constitutively activated in a SOS3-independent manner (16.Guo Y. Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). (iii) S. cervisiae cells expressing all three SOS pathway members (SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3) were much more salt tolerant than cells expressing SOS1 alone (17.Quintero F.J. Ohta M. Shi H. Zhu J.-K. Pardo J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9061-9066Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). SOS1 has been shown to be an output or target of the SOS pathway whose activity is controlled by SOS2/SOS3. SOS1 expression was up-regulated when plants were exposed to high levels of NaCl, and this salt regulation was partly mediated by SOS2 and SOS3 (11.Shi H. Ishitani M. Kim C. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6896-6901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). Transport experiments have shown that plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchange was reduced in sos1 plants relative to activity in wild-type plants, and this activity could not be restored by in vitro addition of activated SOS2 protein (5.Qiu Q.S. Guo Y. Dietrich M.A. Schumaker K.S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8436-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Mutations in the SOS2 and SOS3 genes led to reductions in plasma membrane Na+/H+-exchange activity; however, transport in these mutants could be restored by adding activated SOS2 protein (5.Qiu Q.S. Guo Y. Dietrich M.A. Schumaker K.S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8436-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). SOS1 has been shown to be a phosphorylation substrate for the SOS2/SOS3 kinase complex and these two regulatory proteins are necessary and sufficient for in vivo activation of the SOS1 transporter (17.Quintero F.J. Ohta M. Shi H. Zhu J.-K. Pardo J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9061-9066Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The transport activity of a plant tonoplast Na+/H+ exchanger has been well characterized (3.Blumwald E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 4.Blumwald E. Aharon G.S. Apse M.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 18.Darley C.P. van Wuytswinkel O.C.M. van de Woude K. Mager W.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 19.Venema K. Quintero F.J. Pardo J.M. Donaire J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2413-2418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In addition, the molecular mechanism underlying tonoplast Na+ compartmentation by the exchanger and its function in plant salt tolerance have been recently demonstrated (20.Gaxiola R.A. Rao R. Sherman A. Grisafi P. Alper S.L. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1480-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 21.Apse M.P. Aharon G.S. Snedden W.A. Blumwald E. Science. 1999; 285: 1256-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). When AtNHX1, an Arabidopsis homolog of the S. cerevisiae Na+/H+ exchanger NHX1, was overexpressed in Arabidopsis, tonoplast exchange activity increased (relative to activity in wild-type plants) and the plants were better able to grow in high levels of salt (20.Gaxiola R.A. Rao R. Sherman A. Grisafi P. Alper S.L. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1480-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 21.Apse M.P. Aharon G.S. Snedden W.A. Blumwald E. Science. 1999; 285: 1256-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). The transport activity of AtNHX1 has been demonstrated by expressing the gene in yeast (18.Darley C.P. van Wuytswinkel O.C.M. van de Woude K. Mager W.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), tomato (22.Zhang H.X. Blumwald E. Nature Biotech. 2001; 19: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar), and Brassica (23.Zhang H.X. Hodson J.N. Williams J.P. Blumwald E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12832-12836Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and by reconstituting it into liposomes (19.Venema K. Quintero F.J. Pardo J.M. Donaire J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2413-2418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To understand how intracellular Na+ levels are regulated during salt stress, it will be necessary to determine how the individual proteins that transport Na+ function coordinately. With this as our goal, we asked whether the tonoplast Na+/H+ exchanger is a target of the SOS pathway. Tonoplast Na+/H+-exchange activity was measured using purified membrane vesicles isolated from cell cultures of wild-type and sos plants. When compared with tonoplast Na+/H+-exchange activity in wild type, activity was significantly higher, greatly reduced, and unchanged in sos1, sos2, and sos3, respectively. Activated SOS2 protein increased tonoplast Na+/H+-exchange activity in vesicles isolated from sos2 but did not have any effect on activity in vesicles isolated from wild-type, sos1, or sos3. These results (i) functionally identify another target of the SOS regulatory pathway, (ii) demonstrate that the activity of the tonoplast Na+/H+ exchanger is controlled by the SOS2 kinase, (iii) provide evidence that there can be coordination of the activities of the exchangers in the tonoplast and plasma membrane in Arabidopsis, and (iv) indicate that the activity of the SOS2 protein kinase may be regulated by more than one upstream regulatory component in the salt signal transduction pathway. Plant Materials—Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia was used in all experiments. sos1-1, sos2-2, and sos3–1 plants were as described (7.Zhu J.-K. Liu J. Xiong L. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1181-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). For callus induction, seedlings were germinated on Murashige and Skoog salts (MS, Sigma-Aldrich) and allowed to grow for 2 weeks. When the cotyledons were fully expanded, the seedlings were transferred to callus initiation medium (43 g/liter MS salts, 30 g/liter sucrose, 1× MS vitamins, 3 mg/liter 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 0.05 mg/liter kinetin, 1 g/liter casein hydrolysate, and 7 g/liter agar at pH 5.7), placed in the dark and subcultured onto new medium every 2 weeks. After 3–5 passages, friable callus formed and was transferred from plates to liquid culture (4.3 g/liter MS salts, 30 g/liter sucrose, 1× MS vitamins, 3 mg/liter 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 0.05 mg/liter kinetin, and 1 g/liter casein hydrolysate at pH 5.0). Cells were cultured in the dark at 24 °C with shaking at 130 rpm and were subcultured every 5–7 days. One-week-old cells were harvested and used for membrane isolation. Tonoplast Isolation, Purification, and Characterization—Tonoplast vesicles were isolated using dextran gradients as described previously (24.Parks G.E. Dietrich M.A. Schumaker K.S. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The purity of these membrane preparations was examined by assaying ATPase activity in the absence and presence of a number of inhibitors. To characterize the activities of the H+-ATPases, their substrate hydrolytic activity was determined by measuring the release of Pi from ATP according to Poole et al. (25.Poole R.J. Briskin D.P. Kratky Z. Johnstone R.M. Plant Physiol. 1984; 74: 549-556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Qiu (26.Qiu Q.S. J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 154: 628-633Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Activities for the plasma membrane, mitochondrial and tonoplast ATPases were measured using optimal conditions for each enzyme (27.Gallagher S.R. Leonard R.T. Plant Physiol. 1982; 70: 1335-1340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Ginnini J.L. Briskin D.P. Plant Physiol. 1987; 84: 613-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purity and latency of the membrane preparations were determined as described (25.Poole R.J. Briskin D.P. Kratky Z. Johnstone R.M. Plant Physiol. 1984; 74: 549-556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Qiu Q.S. Su X.F. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 25: 923-928Google Scholar). Plasma Membrane Isolation—Plasma membrane vesicles were isolated using aqueous two-phase partitioning as described in Qiu et al. (5.Qiu Q.S. Guo Y. Dietrich M.A. Schumaker K.S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8436-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Proton Transport Assays—The pH gradient (ΔpH) was established by the activity of the tonoplast H+-ATPase and was measured as a decrease (quench) in the fluorescence of the pH-sensitive fluorescent probe quinacrine (5.Qiu Q.S. Guo Y. Dietrich M.A. Schumaker K.S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8436-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 25.Poole R.J. Briskin D.P. Kratky Z. Johnstone R.M. Plant Physiol. 1984; 74: 549-556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Qiu Q.S. J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 154: 628-633Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Assays (1 ml) contained 5 μm quinacrine, 3 mm ATP, 100 mm BTPCl, 25 mm BTP-Hepes (pH 7.5), 250 mm mannitol, and 50 μg tonoplast protein. Assays were initiated with the addition of MgSO4 (3 mm) and were conducted as described in Qiu et al. (5.Qiu Q.S. Guo Y. Dietrich M.A. Schumaker K.S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8436-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Control experiments were conducted to monitor potential effects of organic solvents used with inhibitors and ionophores on H+-transport; no solvent effects were observed (data not shown). Na+/H+ Exchange Assays—Na+/H+-exchange activity was measured as a Na+-induced dissipation of ΔpH (i.e. a Na+-induced increase in quinacrine fluorescence; 30). For these experiments, ΔpH was established by the H+-pyrophosphatase (22.Zhang H.X. Blumwald E. Nature Biotech. 2001; 19: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 24.Parks G.E. Dietrich M.A. Schumaker K.S. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The reaction medium (1 ml) contained 2.5 μm quinacrine, 0.3 mm PPi-BTP, 50 mm CsCl, 30 mm BTP-Hepes (pH 8.5), 250 mm mannitol, and 50 μg tonoplast protein. Assays were initiated with the addition of MgSO4 (2 mm). While the in vitro activity (hydrolysis and H+-transport) of the tonoplast H+-pyrophosphatase is stimulated by K+ (31.Rea P.A. Poole R.J. Plant Physiol. 1985; 77: 46-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Drozdowicz Y.M. Kissinger J.C. Rea P.A. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the presence of K+ in the transport assays prevented the formation of a stable ΔpH (likely due to phosphate inhibition of the H+-pump when it is operating maximally). 2Q.-S. Qiu and K. S. Schumaker, unpublished data. When Cs+ (which stimulates the H+-pyrophosphatase to a lesser extent, see Ref. 33.Gordon-Weeks R. Koren'kov V.D. Steele S.H. Leigh R.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 901-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was used in place of K+, the activity of the H+pyrophosphatase (H+-transport) was reduced but stable, so Cs+ was used in all assays. The reactions and assays were conducted as described in Qiu et al. (5.Qiu Q.S. Guo Y. Dietrich M.A. Schumaker K.S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8436-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar) with the modifications indicated. To determine initial rates of Na+/H+ exchange (change in fluorescence per minute; Δ% F min–1), changes in relative fluorescence were measured during the first 15 s after addition of Na+. Specific activity was calculated by dividing the initial rate by the mass of tonoplast protein in the reaction (Δ% F mg–1 protein min–1). Membrane Potential Assays—Oxonol V, an inside-positive electrical or membrane potential (ΔΨ)-sensitive fluorescent probe, was used to measure the tonoplast ΔΨ (15.Qiu Q.-S. Barkla B.J. Vera-Estrella R. Zhu J.-K. Schumaker K.S. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 34.Kaestner K.H. Sze H. Plant Physiol. 1987; 83: 483-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assays (1 ml) contained 3 μm Oxonol V (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.3 mm PPi-BTP, 2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm potassium iminodiacetic acid, 30 mm BTP-Hepes (pH 8.5), 250 mm mannitol, and 50 μg tonoplast protein. Assays were initiated with the addition of MgSO4 (2 mm) and formation of ΔΨ was measured as described above for ΔpH at excitation and emission wavelengths of 580 and 650 nm, respectively. Preparation of Constitutively Active Recombinant SOS2 Protein—A constitutively active form of the serine/threonine kinase SOS2, T/DSOS2DF, was used to study regulation of tonoplast Na+/H+-exchange activity. Recombinant wild-type and constitutively active (activated) SOS2 protein was expressed, purified, and assayed as described (5.Qiu Q.S. Guo Y. Dietrich M.A. Schumaker K.S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8436-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 9.Hasegawa P.M. Bressan R.A. Pardo J.M.

Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). When used in transport assays, T/DSOS2DF (at the concentrations indicated) was incubated with membrane vesicles for 7 min at room temperature before ΔpH formation was initiated with the addition of MgSO4. Preparation of AtNHX1 Antibody—A BclI-BamHI fragment of the AtNHX1 cDNA containing the last 122 C-terminal amino acids of the AtNHX1 polypeptide was ligated into the BamHI site of the expression vector pEX2 (35.Stanley K.K. Luzio J.P. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1329-1434Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar) to produce an in-frame translational fusion to β-galactosidase. The construct was verified by DNA sequencing and transformed into Escherichia coli POP2136 (35.Stanley K.K. Luzio J.P. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1329-1434Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Inclusion bodies with the recombinant protein were obtained after induction at 43 °C and resolved using a preparative 6% SDS-PAGE gel. A ground polyacrylamide gel slice containing 2 mg of the fusion protein was used to immunize rabbits by intradermal injections. When used in transport assays, anti-AtNHX1 antibody was diluted 100-fold and incubated with the membrane vesicles for 7 min at room temperature before ΔpH formation was initiated with the addition of MgSO4. Immunoblot Analysis—For immunoblot analysis, 6 μl of 3× protein loading buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 30% glycerol, 1.5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.3% bromphenol blue) was added to 50 μg of either plasma membrane vesicles (PM) or tonoplast vesicles (VM) in a 20-μl volume. The samples were boiled for 5 min, and the proteins separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were transferred from the gel to a pure nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories) at 80 volts for 60 min. The membrane was blocked in 1× PBS buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.4 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4) with 5% fat free milk overnight at 4 °C; and then rinsed one time with 1× PBS and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of the AtNHX1 antibody for 3 h at room temperature. After three washes with 1× PBS buffer, the membrane was incubated with anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody diluted 1:2000 (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. After five washes in 1× PBS, the immunoreactive bands were detected using the chemiluminescent ECL detection substrate (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to x-ray film. Protein Determination—The protein content of membrane vesicles was determined by the method of Bradford (36.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214515) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Arabidopsis Tonoplast Vesicles Are Transport Competent—In order to study the transport activity of the tonoplast Na+/H+ exchanger, membrane vesicles were isolated from cell cultures of Arabidopsis using dextran gradients. The purity of the membrane preparations was analyzed by comparing the substrate hydrolytic and H+-transport activities of the ATPases on the mitochondrial, tonoplast, and plasma membranes, and the results are shown in Table I and Fig. 1. ATP hydrolysis was unaffected by molybdate (an inhibitor of nonspecific phosphatases) or inhibitors of the plasma membrane (vanadate) and mitochondrial (azide) membrane ATPases, but was sensitive to the tonoplast H+-ATPase inhibitor, nitrate (45.1% inhibition at 50 mm), demonstrating that the vesicles were enriched in tonoplast. The sidedness of the membrane preparations was determined as described (29.Qiu Q.S. Su X.F. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 25: 923-928Google Scholar). When Triton X-100 (0.02%) was added to the assays, activity increased only 2.2% indicating that the vesicles were oriented mainly rightside-out relative to the orientation of the tonoplast in vivo (Table I).Table IDetermination of vesicle purity and sidednessATPase activityμmol Pi mg-1 protein min-1+BTPCI (50 mm)0.91 ± 0.02 (100)Triton X-100 (0.02%)0.93 ± 0.03 (2.2%)aStimulation of ATPase activity.Nitrate (50 mm)0.50 ± 0.01 (45.1%)bInhibition of ATPase activity.Vanadate (100 μm)0.83 ± 0.02 (8.8%)bInhibition of ATPase activity.Azide (1 mm)0.83 ± 0.02 (8.8%)bInhibition of ATPase activity.Molybdate (100 μm)0.88 ± 0.01 (3.3%)bInhibition of ATPase activity.a Stimulation of ATPase activity.b Inhibition of ATPase activity. Open table in a new tab Quenching of quinacrine fluorescence was observed when ATP/Mg2+ was added to the vesicles (Fig. 1), and quinacrine fluorescence recovered if either the protonophore gramicidin or the uncoupler NH4Cl were added after ΔpH had formed (Fig. 1A and data not shown, respectively). Fluorescence quench was inhibited if the H+ channel inhibitor N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide was added at the start of the reaction (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that this ATP/Mg2+-induced fluorescence quench was caused by the transport of H+ and reflects the formation of a ΔpH. A significant reduction in H+ transport activity in the presence of nitrate and insensitivity to vanadate (Fig. 1, C and D) provided additional evidence that the vesicles were enriched in tonoplast. Wild-type Arabidopsis Cells Have Tonoplast Na+/H+-Exchange Activity—Dissipation of a ΔpH (formed by the tonoplast H+-pyrophosphatase) was induced by the addition of Na+ to tonoplast vesicles that had been isolated from wild-type cells (Fig. 2A). To determine the ion specificity of the exchange reaction, the ability of various salts to dissipate ΔpH was monitored. Similar rates of exchange were observed when either NaCl or sodium gluconate was added (Fig. 2, A and E), suggesting that Na+ and not the anion is responsible for the dissipation of ΔpH. Addition of Li+ also led to dissipation of ΔpH, but at a slower rate (Fig. 2, B and E). When salts of cesium, 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxylmethyl)methylamine] (BTP)-propane or K+ were used instead of Na+, no dissipation of ΔpH was obser"

However, the TOM machinery itself is not sufficient for the assembly of Tom40 into the mature TOM complex of ∼450 kDa. The mitochondrial outer membrane protein Mas37 (20.Gratzer S. Lithgow T.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) is involved in the assembly pathway of Tom40 (21.Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Schönfisch B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T.

Mas37 is the only known subunit of an outer membrane complex of ∼200 kDa, termed the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM complex) (21.Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Schönfisch B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In contrast to Tom40, Mas37 is not essential for cell viability (20.Gratzer S. Lithgow T.

This suggests either that assembly via the SAM complex is not essential for the function of Tom40 or that the SAM complex contains an unknown essential subunit. For this report, we have purified the SAM complex and identified a new subunit. Sam50 is essential for viability of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and crucial for the assembly pathway of Tom40 and the outer membrane protein porin. Our results suggest that protein assembly is an essential function of the mitochondrial outer membrane.

After 30-min incubation on ice, sucrose (final concentration 0.45 m) was added and mitochondria were incubated for 10 min on ice.

After a clarifying spin (20,000 × g, 15 min) the supernatant was loaded onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient (11 ml, 29.1%, 37.65%, 46.2%, 54.77% (w/v) sucrose in 5 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl). After centrifugation (100,000 × g, 16 h, 4 °C), 750-μl fractions were collected from top to bottom. Sam50, an Essential Protein of the Mitochondrial Outer Membrane—To identify further subunits of the SAM complex, we constructed a S. cerevisiae strain with a protein A tag at Mas37. The growth behavior of the strain was indistinguishable from wild-type yeast. Mitochondria were isolated and lysed with digitonin. The SAM complex was purified by IgG-affinity chromatography. Two protein bands were specifically eluted and identified by mass spectrometry as Mas37ProtA and a novel protein, termed Sam50 (ORF YNL026W) (Fig. 1A, lane 1). The primary structure of Sam50 predicts a protein of 484 amino acid residues with an α-helical segment in the N-terminal region, followed by multiple β-strands (β-barrel) (Fig. 1B). The C-terminal Sam50 domain of ∼30 kDa is conserved from bacteria to all eukaryotic kingdoms. Bacterial proteins containing this conserved domain include Omp1, Omp85, Oma87, and D-15, while the eukaryotic homologues of Sam50 have not been further characterized. Omp85 is also related to the chloroplast channel Toc75 (28.Bölter B. Soll J. Schulz A. Hinnah S. Wagner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15831-15836Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 29.Reumann S. Davila-Aponte J. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 2003; 299: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar); however, the relation of Sam50 to Toc75 is much weaker than that to its not yet characterized eukaryotic homologues. Deletion of SAM50 is lethal to yeast cells (not shown). We generated a yeast strain with an HA-tag at Sam50. The strain grew like wild-type yeast. When mitochondria were lysed with digitonin and separated by BN-PAGE, Sam50 migrated like Mas37, confirming its presence in the 200-kDa SAM complex (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). Upon sonication of mitochondria in the presence of salt, Sam50 remained in the membrane pellet like the membrane proteins ADP/ATP carrier and Tim44 (translocase of inner membrane), while the soluble protein Mge1 was extracted (Fig. 1C, lanes 1–3). Treatment of mitochondria at pH 11.5 extracted Mge1 and the peripheral membrane protein Tim44, while Sam50 and the ADP/ATP carrier remained in the membrane sheets (Fig. 1C, lanes 4–6), indicating that Sam50 is an integral membrane protein in agreement with the secondary structure prediction. Upon separation of mitochondrial outer and inner membrane vesicles on a sucrose gradient (24.Geissler A. Chacinska A. Truscott K.N. Wiedemann N. Brandner K. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Cell. 2002; 111: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), Sam50 was found in the outer membrane fraction like porin (VDAC) and the receptor Tom70, while Tim23 was present in the inner membrane fractions (Fig. 1D). We conclude that Sam50 is an integral protein of the outer membrane associated with Mas37. Sam50 is thus the second mitochondrial outer membrane protein essential for cell viability of yeast. Sam50 Is Required for the Assembly Pathway of Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Proteins—We generated temperature-sensitive alleles of SAM50 by error-prone PCR and selected the mutant strains sam50-1 and sam50-3. At 23 °C the growth of the mutant cells was similar to wild-type cells, while they were unable to grow at 37 °C (Fig. 2A). To minimize indirect effects of the sam50 mutations on cellular and mitochondrial functions, cells were grown at the permissive temperature of 23 °C, and the isolated mitochondria were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C to induce the mutant phenotype. The isolated mitochondria contained wild-type levels of the marker proteins analyzed, including matrix Hsp70, Tom70, Tom40, and porin (Fig. 2B). Similarly, the pre-existing TOM complex analyzed by BN-PAGE and Western blotting for Tom40 was comparable between wild-type and mutants (Fig. 2C, upper panel). Mas37 was present in wild-type amounts in sam50-1 mitochondria (Fig. 2B). The amount of SAM complex of sam50-1 mitochondria, analyzed by BN-PAGE and antibodies against Mas37, was reduced by about 50% (Fig. 2C, lower panel), indicating that the assembly of the SAM complex was partially impaired in the mutant mitochondria. In sam50-3 mitochondria, the amount of both Mas37 and SAM complex was moderately reduced compared with wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, both mutant mitochondria still contain a SAM complex, but in reduced amounts. To analyze the effect of the sam50 mutations on the assembly pathway of Tom40, we used an in organello assay with 35S-labeled precursor of Tom40. In wild-type mitochondria, the assembly into the 450-kDa TOM complex occurs in two intermediate steps of 250 kDa (assembly intermediate I) and 100 kDa (assembly intermediate II) that can be separated by BN-PAGE of digitonin-lysed mitochondria (Fig. 2D, lanes 1–3) (15.Model K.

Schönfisch B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the mature TOM complex is in continuous exchange with the assembly intermediate II (15.Model K. Meisinger C. Prinz T. Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Therefore, newly synthesized individual subunits like Tom40 can be incorporated into pre-existing TOM complexes (15.Model K. Meisinger C. Prinz T. Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 18.Rapaport D. Taylor R.D. Käser M. Langer T. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Mol. Biol.

Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In both sam50 mutant mitochondria, the assembly of Tom40 was nearly blocked, already at the level of the intermediate I (Fig. 2D, lanes 4–9). Since the assembly intermediate I represents the SAM complex-bound precursor of Tom40 (21.Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Schönfisch B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), this result indicates that a functional Sam50 is important for the action of the SAM complex. A working hypothesis for the composition of the SAM complex includes the observation that mas37Δ mitochondria accumulate a crippled (smaller) form of the assembly intermediate I consistent with the lack of one molecule of Mas37 (21.Wiedemann N.

Thus, the SAM complex may contain one molecule of Mas37 and up to three molecules of Sam50 (Mas37ProtA was overexpressed in the strain used for Fig. 1A). To determine the specificity of Sam50 function, we analyzed the biogenesis of three further mitochondrial proteins, the most abundant outer membrane protein porin (VDAC, Por1) (31.Mannella C.A. Neuwald A.F. Lawrence C.E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 163-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Blachly-Dyson E. Song J. Wolfgang W.J. Colombini M. Forte M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5727-5738Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and two proteins that are translocated across the outer and inner membranes to the matrix. Mature, assembled porin has been shown to form complexes in the size range of ∼200–400 kDa (27.Krimmer T. Rapaport D. Ryan M.T. Meisinger C. Kassenbrock C.K. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Douglas M.G. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In wild-type mitochondria, the assembly of radiolabeled porin precursor into these complexes can be monitored by analysis on BN-PAGE (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–3). In both sam50 mutant mitochondria, the assembly of porin was strongly reduced (Fig. 3A, lanes 4–9). In contrast, the import of two matrix proteins, α-subunit of mitochondrial processing peptidase and the model protein Su9-DHFR with the presequence of F0-ATPase subunit 9 fused to dihydrofolate reductase, was not affected by the sam50 mutations (Fig. 3, B and C). We conclude that Sam50 is required for the biogenesis of β-barrel proteins of the mitochondrial outer membrane (Tom40 and porin) but not for the translocation of preproteins across the outer and inner membranes into the matrix. Conclusions—We have identified the second essential protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Unlike the essential protein Tom40 that is required for the import of virtually all mitochondrial proteins (7.Baker K.P. Schaniel A. Vestweber D. Schatz G. Nature. 1990; 348: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 12.Gabriel K. Egan B. Lithgow T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2380-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27.Krimmer T.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), Sam50 plays a specific role in the assembly pathways of outer membrane proteins. Together with the non-essential Mas37, Sam50 forms the SAM complex of the outer membrane. Sam50 contains a β-barrel domain that is conserved in evolution from bacteria to man. Recently, two different views have been reported for the function of the bacterial homologue Omp85, involvement in transport of either proteins or lipids to the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (30.Voulhoux R. Bos M.P. Geurtsen J. Mols M. Tommassen J. Science. 2003; 299: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 33.Genevrois S. Steeghs L. Roholl P. Letesson J.-J. van der Ley P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1780-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A reason for the controversial views is that the bacteria had to be incubated under noninduced conditions for several hours to deplete the cells of Omp85. With the in organello assembly assay of mitochondria, we can grow the cells at permissive temperature and induce the phenotype by shifting the isolated mitochondria to non-permissive temperature for only 15 min, thus minimizing indirect effects. We thereby showed that Sam50 is a crucial subunit of the assembly machinery for outer membrane proteins. Our results raise the exciting possibility that the mitochondrial outer membrane has retained a conserved domain for the assembly of β-barrel proteins. We thank Drs. A. Chacinska and P. Rehling for discussion and advice and B. Schönfisch for expert technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2025766479,"Staphylococcus aureus requires iron for growth and utilizes heme as a source of iron during infection. Staphylococcal surface proteins capture hemoglobin, release heme from hemoglobin and transport this compound across the cell wall envelope and plasma membrane into the bacterial cytoplasm. Here we show that Staphylococcus aureus isdG and isdI encode cytoplasmic proteins with heme binding properties. IsdG and IsdI cleave the tetrapyrrol ring structure of heme in the presence of NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase, thereby releasing iron. Further, IsdI complements the heme utilization deficiency of a Corynebacterium ulcerans heme oxygenase mutant, demonstrating in vivo activity of this enzyme. Although Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus anthracis encode homologues of IsdG and IsdI, these proteins are not found in other bacteria or mammals. Thus, it appears that bacterial pathogens evolved different strategies to retrieve iron from scavenged heme molecules and that staphylococcal IsdG and IsdI represent examples of bacterial heme-oxygenases."
https://openalex.org/W2104418223,"Selectin-ligand interactions mediate the tethering and rolling of circulating leukocytes on vascular surfaces during inflammation and immune surveillance. To support rolling, these interactions are thought to have rapid off-rates that increase slowly as wall shear stress increases. However, the increase of off-rate with force, an intuitive characteristic named slip bonds, is at odds with a shear threshold requirement for selectin-mediated cell rolling. As shear drops below the threshold, fewer cells roll and those that do roll less stably and with higher velocity. We recently demonstrated a low force regime where the off-rate of P-selectin interacting with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) decreased with increasing force. This counter-intuitive characteristic, named catch bonds, might partially explain the shear threshold phenomenon. Because L-selectin-mediated cell rolling exhibits a much more pronounced shear threshold, we used atomic force microscopy and flow chamber experiments to determine off-rates of L-selectin interacting with their physiological ligands and with an antibody. Catch bonds were observed at low forces for L-selectin-PSGL-1 interactions coinciding with the shear threshold range, whereas slip bonds were observed at higher forces. These catch-slip transitional bonds were also observed for L-selectin interacting with endoglycan, a newly identified PSGL-1-like ligand. By contrast, only slip bonds were observed for L-selectin-antibody interactions. These findings suggest that catch bonds contribute to the shear threshold for rolling and are a common characteristic of selectin-ligand interactions.

Selectins are a family of adhesion molecules that contribute to leukocyte trafficking during inflammation and tissue injury and to lymphocyte homing (1.Vestweber D. Blanks J.E. Physiol.

These interactions mediate tethering and rolling of circulating leukocytes on endothelial cells, platelets, and adherent leukocytes under flow. Selectin-ligand interactions are rapid and transient. In addition, the mechanically stressful environment in the circulation imposes forces on selectin-ligand bonds, which affect their dissociation rates. Bell suggested that applied force could accelerate bond dissociation, because work done by the force could lower the energy barrier between the bound and free states (4.Bell G.I. Science. 1978; 200: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3322) Google Scholar). Dembo et al. (5.Dembo M. Tourney D.C. Saxman K. Hammer D. Proc. R. Soc.

These two types of behavior are named slip and catch bonds, respectively. Bonds whose off-rates are independent of force are called ideal bonds (5.Dembo M. Tourney D.C. Saxman K. Hammer D. Proc. R.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to this region block binding of PSGL-1 to both P- and L-selectin (24.Moore K.L. Patel K.D. Bruehl R.E. Fugang L. Johnson D.A. Lichen- stein H.S. Cummings R.D.

Blood. 1998; 91: 154-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with P-selectin, L-selectin binds to PSGL-1 with lower affinity and more rapid dissociation kinetics (9.Alon R. Chen S. Fuhlbrigge R.

However, the general binding similarities suggest that the L-selectin-PSGL-1 interaction, like the P-selectin-PSGL-1 interaction, might also behave as catch-slip transitional bonds. Catch bonds have been suggested to partly explain the shear threshold requirement for selectin-mediated adhesion (19.Marshall B.T. Long M. Piper J.W. Yago T. McEver R.P. Zhu C. Nature. 2003; 423: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Below the threshold, fewer cells roll, and those that do roll less stably and with higher velocity (26.Finger E.B. Puri K.D. Alon R. Lawrence M.B. von Andrian U.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 27.Lawrence M.B. Kansas G.S. Kunkel E.J. Ley K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Bond lifetimes at low wall shear stresses might be too brief to support stable rolling. As the wall shear stress is increased, catch bonds might retard dissociation at the trailing edge, thereby stabilizing rolling, increasing the number of rolling cells, and lowering their velocities. Compared with that for P-selectin, the shear threshold of L-selectin-mediated leukocyte rolling is much more pronounced and occurs over a much wider range of wall shear stresses (26.Finger E.B. Puri K.D. Alon R. Lawrence M.B. von Andrian U.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 27.Lawrence M.B. Kansas G.S. Kunkel E.J. Ley K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). If catch bonds contribute to the shear threshold, the L-selectin-PSGL-1 interaction should behave as catch-slip transitional bonds with transition over a much wider force range. Endoglycan is a recently identified PSGL-1-like member of the CD34 family of sialomucins expressed on endothelial cells (28.Sassetti C. Van Zante A. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9001-9010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interactions of endoglycan with L-selectin also support cell rolling under flow (29.Fieger C.B. Sassetti C.M. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27390-27398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). If catch bonds are a general feature of selectin-ligand interactions, the L-selectin-endoglycan interaction should also exhibit catch-slip transitional bonds. We tested these hypotheses by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and flow chamber experiments to measure off-rates of L-selectin dissociating from two forms of PSGL-1, from endoglycan, and from an antibody. Catch-slip transitional bonds were documented in interactions of L-selectin with ligands but not with antibody, which prompts renewed interest in how to model these bonds. Proteins and Antibodies—A cDNA encoding the lectin and epidermal growth factor domains and the two consensus repeats of human L-selectin plus a donor splicing sequence was amplified by the PCR and ligated into the pIG1 vector (30.Simmons D.L. Hartley D. Cellular Interactions in Development. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 93-128Google Scholar), which encodes the heavy chain CH2-CH3 and hinge region of human IgG1. The vector was transiently transfected into COS7 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The L-selectin-Ig was purified from supernatants by protein G affinity chromatography. Membrane L-selectin was purified from human tonsils (27.Lawrence M.B. Kansas G.S. Kunkel E.J. Ley K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), and native dimeric PSGL-1 was purified from human neutrophils (31.Moore K.L. Stults N.L. Diaz S. Smith D.F. Cummings R.D. Varki A. McEver R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Recombinant monomeric soluble PSGL-1 (sPSGL-1) was purified from supernatants of CHO cell transfectants (18.Yago T. Leppänen A. Qiu H. Marcus W.D. Nollert M.U. Zhu C. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J.

The endoglycan-Ig, which consists of the extracellular region of the molecule fused to a human Fc domain, was collected from transfected COS7 cell supernatants (28.Sassetti C. Van Zante A. Rosen S.D.

Anti-human IgG Fc polyclonal antibody was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The AFM System—The AFM system was built and calibrated in-house (design adapted from Vincent Moy, University of Miami) (Fig. 1A) (19.Marshall B.T. Long M. Piper J.W. Yago T. McEver R.P. Zhu C. Nature. 2003; 423: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). It consists of a piezoelectric translator (PZT) (Polytec Physik Instrument, Boston) on which a cantilever (Thermomicroscopes, Sunnyvale, CA) is directly mounted. A laser (Oz Optics, Ontario, Canada) focused on the end of the back of the cantilever is deflected onto a photodiode (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ) to measure cantilever deflection, which is converted to force using the cantilever spring constant. Each cantilever spring constant (4-30 pN/nm) was calibrated during the experiment using thermal fluctuation analysis (33.Hutter J.L. Bechhoefer J. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1993; 64: 1868-1873Crossref Scopus (3320) Google Scholar). A personal computer with a data acquisition board (National Instruments, Austin, TX) was used to control the movement of the PZT and to collect the signal from the photodiode. LabView (National Instruments) was used as the interface between the user and the data acquisition board. Functionalizing the AFM Cantilever Tip—Cantilever tips were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 10 μg/ml PL2, protein G, or DREG56 or 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). After rinsing, the coated cantilevers were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 1% BSA to block nonspecific adhesion. PL2-coated (or protein G-coated) cantilevers were further functionalized by incubation in 10 μl of 100 ng/ml (s)PSGL-1 (or endoglycan supernatant) for 20 min at room temperature. DREG56-, BSA-, and some PL2- and protein G-coated cantilevers were used without further modification (Fig. 1B). Formation of L-selectin Bilayer—Membrane L-selectin was reconstituted into glass-supported, polyethyleneimine (PEI)-cushioned lipid bilayers (Fig. 1B) by using vesicle fusion (19.Marshall B.T.

Our AFM experiments attempted to measure specific bond lifetimes at forces as low as thermally driven force fluctuations, which have a standard deviation of ∼4-11 pN at room temperature, depending on the stiffness of the cantilever used (19.Marshall B.T. Long M. Piper J.W. Yago T. McEver R.P. Zhu C. Nature. 2003; 423: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). These are much smaller than the adhesion forces between coverslips and SiN3 cantilever tips, yielding ∼100% nonspecific binding because all nonspecific interactions can be detected. Covering the glass with an intact lipid bilayer reduced the nonspecific binding to nearly zero. Nonspecific binding was increased when L-selectin was incorporated in the bilayer, presumably because it was partly disrupted by the inversely inserted molecules that have extracellular domains much larger than the normal gap distance between the bilayer and the coverglass. It was crucial to add a PEI cushion to accommodate the inversely oriented molecules between the glass and the bilayer (Fig. 1B), which reduced the nonspecific binding to ∼5% (Fig. 2, A-D). Coverslips of 40 mm in diameter (Bioptechs, Butler, PA) were cleaned by using a mixture of 70% 12 n sulfuric acid and 30% hydrogen peroxide by volume at a temperature of 100 °C for 45 min, rinsed extensively with deionized water, and dried completely under an argon stream. The cleaned coverslips were stored in a desiccator and used within a 2-week period. The coverslip was first immersed in a 100-ppm PEI (Mr = 1800 g/mol, 95% purity; Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) solution of 0.5 mm KNO3 (Fisher) in deionized water, pH 7.0, for 20 min. After rinsing, excess water was removed from the coverslip surface by a gentle stream of argon. The coverslip was then placed in a desiccator for 10 min to dry the PEI layer (34.Wong J.Y. Majewski J. Seitz M. Park C.K. Israelachvili J.N. Smith G.S. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1445-1457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) before forming an L-selectin bilayer on it. An L-selectin-incorporated lipid vesicle solution was prepared following the method of McConnell et al. (35.McConnell H.M. Watts T.H. Weis R.M. Brian A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 864: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) and Dustin et al. (36.Dustin M.L. Olive D. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, vesicles were formed by hydrating a dried lipid film of egg phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) with 2% octyl β-glucopyranoside (Fisher), Tris saline solution creating 250 μl of 0.8 mm lipid solution. The 2% octyl β-glucopyranoside, egg phosphatidylcholine solution was combined with 250 μl of 1% octyl β-glucopyranoside solution with a 28 μg/ml concentration of membrane L-selectin. The resulting 0.4 mm lipid solution was dialyzed with three 1-liter changes of Tris saline buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) in 12-h increments. The resulting lipid vesicle solution was stored under argon at 4 °C and used within several months. Bilayers were formed using the method of vesicle fusion (35.McConnell H.M. Watts T.H. Weis R.M. Brian A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 864: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 36.Dustin M.L. Olive D. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A PEI-coated coverslip was placed in a Petri dish, and a 4-μl drop of L-selectin-incorporated lipid vesicle solution was placed on the surface of the coverslip. After 20 min of incubation under a damp paper towel, the Petri dish was filled with 10 ml of HBSS with 1% BSA. The L-selectin bilayers so formed had low molecular densities, which ensured their infrequent binding to the (s)PSGL-1-, endoglycan-, or DREG56-coated cantilever tips, as required for measuring single bond interactions. Bilayers were immediately used in AFM experiments. AFM Adhesion Event and Lifetime Measurements—Binding was enabled by driving the cantilever tip with the PZT to contact the bilayer for 2 s with an ∼30-pN compressive force. The cantilever was then retracted at a speed of 250 nm/s. The presence or absence of adhesion was detected from the force-scan curves. The curves in Fig. 1, C and D, illustrate how the cantilever was bent (Fig. 1D, insets) when a compressive or a tensile force was respectively applied to the tip. The approach curves were horizontal (zero mean force) initially but were bent downward when the tip was pressed onto the bilayer. The retraction curve mirrored the approach curve until the cantilever was no longer bent. The upper curves in Fig. 1, C and D, illustrate a contact cycle without binding, where the retraction curve returned to zero mean force. When the tip was linked to the bilayer by a molecular bond, continued retraction yielded a tensile force that signified binding, as illustrated by the lower curves in Fig. 1, C and D. Adhesion frequency was measured as the number of binding events per 100 repeated approach-retraction cycles using the same tip contacting the same L-selectin bilayer spot. Once the cantilever retracted a predetermined distance and stopped, a constant force was applied to the bond, if a bond was present, and it survived the ramping to the desired force. The lifetime was measured from the instant when the PZT stopped to the instant of bond failure. Force-scan data were acquired at 5 kHz. Since most of the lifetimes were tens of milliseconds or longer, a number of instantaneous forces were averaged to allow lifetime measurement at forces comparable with the level of thermal fluctuations (19.Marshall B.T. Long M. Piper J.W. Yago T. McEver R.P. Zhu C. Nature. 2003; 423: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Fig. 1D exemplifies how the amplitude of force fluctuations in Fig. 1C was reduced by a sliding average of 10 points, such that the levels of force-scan traces before and after the rupture event no longer overlap. This is equivalent to trading the temporal resolution (reduced from 0.2 to 2 ms) for the force resolution. Analysis of Lifetimes—Lifetimes were analyzed using the first-order dissociation kinetics model, Bkoff→R+L where R, L, and B denote receptor, ligand, and bond, respectively. For lifetimes measured at constant force f, koff is assumed to be a constant at each force and independent of time t. This model predicts that lifetimes of single bonds are exponentially distributed, p = exp(-koff(f)t), where p is the probability of a bond observed at time 0 that remained intact at time t. Taking the semi-log linearizes the exponential distribution; thus the slope of the ln(number of events with a lifetime >t) versus t plot equals -koff. It should be noted that the scattering of the individual lifetime data is not a reflection of the lack of measurement accuracy, which is better than 2 ms for the AFM experiments and 4 ms for the flow chamber experiments with the high speed camera. Rather, it is a manifestation of individual molecular bond dissociation, which is stochastic by nature. Thus, the S.D. σ(t) should not be used as error bars because it measures a statistical property of the probability distribution rather than the uncertainty in the data. Indeed, it can be easily shown that σ(t) of an exponential distribution is equal to the mean 〈t〉, both of which equal the reciprocal of off-rate, 1/koff. Several methods were employed to assess the statistical significance of the differences in the koff values estimated at different forces, especially in the force range where catch bonds were observed. First, individual AFM experiments were performed to measure a few lifetimes at each of several force levels that covered the entire force range. The off-rate at each force level was estimated from the reciprocal of the mean and of the S.D. of these measurements. It was found that the koff versus f curves so obtained were stable as soon as the number of measurements reached ∼50. To ensure statistical stability, the data shown in Fig. 4 include 350-400 measurements for L-selectin interacting with either form of PSGL-1 and with endoglycan. The larger data set allowed us to examine the distributions of lifetimes using the ln(number of events with a lifetime ≥ t) versus t plots (Fig. 3), which used the negative slope of the linear fit as estimates for koff. The 95% confidence intervals of the slopes were used to measure the uncertainties of the koff values (shown as error bars in Fig. 4). The statistical significance of differences between any two neighboring points in the catch bond range (where the majority of the data reside) was determined by the F test that compared the slopes of the two ln(number of events with a lifetime ≥ t) versus t data. Coupling L-selectin-Ig to Microspheres and sPSGL-1 and DREG56 to Flow Chamber—1 × 108 polystyrene microspheres (6 μm diameter; Polysciences, Inc.) were incubated with 200 μg/ml anti-human IgG Fc antibody in 500 μl of HBSS overnight at 4 °C. Microspheres were washed three times with HBSS and incubated with 1% human serum albumin (HSA) in HBSS for 2 h at room temperature to block nonspecific binding. After washing with HBSS, anti-human IgG antibody-coated microspheres were incubated with L-selectin-Ig for 1 h at 4 °C in 500 μl of HBSS. A 30-μl drop of streptavidin (50 μg/ml; Pierce) or DREG56 (0.3 μg/ml) was placed in a demarcated area on a 35-mm tissue culture plate (Corning Glass) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The area was washed twice with HBSS and then blocked with HBSS containing 1% HSA at room temperature for 2 h. The streptavidin-coated plates were further functionalized by incubation with biotinylated sPSGL-1 at 4 °C for 1 h. Transient Tether Lifetime Measurements—Transient tether lifetimes as a function of wall shear stress were measured at low densities of sPSGL-1 or of DREG56 using a flow chamber as described previously (18.Yago T. Leppänen A. Qiu H. Marcus W.D. Nollert M.U. Zhu C. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 787-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Images of transient tethers were captured with a FASTCAM-Super 10 K high speed digital video camera (Photron, San Jose, CA) at 250 frames/s. Images were played back in slow motion, and the durations of transient tethers were measured by using frame-by-frame analysis with a previously described imaging system (18.Yago T. Leppänen A. Qiu H. Marcus W.D. Nollert M.U. Zhu C. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 787-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Four sets of lifetimes (∼100 tethering events in each set) were measured for each interaction at each wall shear stress. Each set was analyzed by the ln(number of events with a lifetime ≥ t) versus t plot, which was fitted by a straight line. The correlation coefficients, R2, were >0.9 for all fits. Means and standard deviations of lifetimes at each wall shear stress level were also calculated. Off-rates were derived from tether lifetimes by the same methods used for the AFM experiments. The mean ± S.D. of the negative slope, 1/〈t〉, and 1/σ(t) of four independent sets of experiments were plotted against the wall shear stress (Fig. 5). The statistical significance of differences at any two neighboring wall shear stresses was assessed by the Student's t test. Tether Lever Arm Measurements—The force on the tether of a microsphere was calculated based on the tether angle, which was derived from the tether lever arm, i.e. the lateral distance on the flow chamber floor between the contact point of the microsphere and the anchor point of sPSGL-1 or DREG56. The lever arm of the L-selectin-DREG56 tether, which was directly measured by a previously described flow reversal method (18.Yago T. Leppänen A. Qiu H. Marcus W.D. Nollert M.U. Zhu C. Cummings R."
https://openalex.org/W2166046639,"We have previously demonstrated that shear stress increases transcription of the endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) by a pathway involving activation of the tyrosine kinase c-Src and extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). In the present study sought to determine the events downstream of this pathway. Shear stress activated a human eNOS promoter chloramphenicol acetyl-CoA transferase chimeric construct in a time-dependent fashion, and this could be prevented by inhibition of the c-Src and MEK1/2. Studies using electromobility shift assays, promoter deletions, and promoter mutations revealed that shear activation of the eNOS promoter was due to binding of nuclear factor κB subunits p50 and p65 to a GAGACC sequence –990 to –984 base pairs upstream of the eNOS transcription start site. Shear induced nuclear translocation of p50 and p65, and activation of the eNOS promoter by shear could be prevented by co-transfection with a dominant negative I kappa Bα. Exposure of endothelial cells to shear resulted in Iκ kinase phosphorylation, and this was blocked by the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 and the cSrc inhibitor PP1, suggesting these signaling molecules are upstream of NFκB activation. These experiments indicate that shear stress increases eNOS transcription by NFκB activation and p50/p65 binding to a GAGACC sequence present of the human eNOS promoter. While NFκB activation is generally viewed as a proinflammatory stimulus, the current data indicate that its transient activation by shear may increase expression of eNOS, which via production of nitric oxide could convey anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1989738839,"Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), a heterodimeric hemeprotein, is the only receptor for the biological messenger nitric oxide (NO) identified to date and is intimately involved in various signal transduction pathways. By using the recently discovered NO- and heme-independent sGC activator BAY 58-2667 and a novel cGMP reporter cell, we could distinguish between heme-containing and heme-free sGC in an intact cellular system. Using these novel tools, we identified the invariant amino acids tyrosine 135 and arginine 139 of the β1-subunit as crucially important for both the binding of the heme moiety and the activation of sGC by BAY 58-2667. The heme is displaced by BAY 58-2667 due to a competition between the carboxylic groups of this compound and the heme propionic acids for the identified residues tyrosine 135 and arginine 139. This displacement results in the release of the axial heme ligand histidine 105 and to the observed activation of sGC. Based on these findings we postulate a signal transmission triad composed of histidine 105, tyrosine 135, and arginine 139 responsible for the enzyme activation by this compound and probably also for transducing changes in heme status and porphyrin geometry upon NO binding into alterations of sGC catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1967868597,"Neurite outgrowth is an important process in the formation of neuronal networks. It is widely accepted that Rac1 and Cdc42, members of the Rho GTPase family, positively regulate neurite extension through reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton; however, it remains largely unknown when and where Rac1 and Cdc42 are activated during neuritogenesis. This study visualized the spatio-temporal regulation of Rac1 and Cdc42 activities during nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth in living PC12 cells by using probes based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Immediately after the addition of NGF, Rac1 and Cdc42 were transiently activated in broad areas of the cell periphery; a repetitive activation and inactivation cycle was then observed at the motile tips of protrusions. This localized activation, which was more evident in PC12 cells treated with NGF for more than 24 h, might facilitate neurite extension, because the expression of constitutively active mutants of Rac1 and Cdc42 abrogated NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. FRET imaging also delineated a difference between the localization of activated Rac1 and that of Cdc42 within the neurite tips. Experiments with dominant-negative mutants suggested that Rac1 and Cdc42 were activated by a common guanine nucleotide exchange factor(s) in an early stage of the activation phase. Therefore, the difference between Rac1- and Cdc42-activated areas possibly came from the differential localization between Rac1-specific GTPase-activation proteins (GAPs) and Cdc42-specific GAPs.

Neuronal morphogenesis, including axon growth and dendrite elaboration, is required for the basic function of neurons to communicate with each other and with effector cells. Rho GTPases (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42), which control actin dynamics in a diversity of cellular functions (1.Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar, 2.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar, 3.Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar), also play key roles in neuronal morphogenesis during the development of the neuronal network (4.Luo L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 5.Mueller B.K. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 351-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Rac1 and Cdc42, implicated in the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia in non-neuronal cells, respectively (2.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar), have been accepted as positive regulators of neurite outgrowth (4.Luo L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). However, much less is known about the mechanism of the spatio-temporal regulation of their respective activities. Rho GTPases function as molecular switches, shuttling between a GDP-bound inactive state and a GTP-bound active state; the GTP-bound Rho GTPases can bind to various effectors to elicit different biological activities. Rho GTPases are regulated by two classes of enzymes, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; NGF, nerve growth factor; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac1 interacting-binding; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). GEFs act to enhance the exchange of bound GDP for GTP and thus activate the Rho GTPases; whereas GAPs inhibit Rho family members by potentiating their intrinsic GTPase activity (3.Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar). In addition, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors inhibit the exchange of GDP for GTP and also hold Rho GTPases in the cytoplasm (6.Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Recent studies have unraveled an increasing number of regulators and downstream targets of Rho GTPases (1.Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar, 7.Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar, 8.Moon S.Y. Zheng Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). To understand the signaling pathway in neurite outgrowth, the particular subset of regulators and effectors working with Rac1 and Cdc42 during this process needs to be clarified. As an initial step, determining when and where Rac1 and Cdc42 are activated during neuritogenesis is essential. Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells have been frequently used as a model system for neurite outgrowth induced by nerve growth factor (NGF). In this study, we visualized Rac1 and Cdc42 activities in this process by using in vivo probes based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (9.Itoh R.E. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Immediately after NGF addition, Rac1 and Cdc42 were broadly activated in peripheral areas. However, this widespread activation was transient, and then recurrent activation was observed at the tips of protrusions. The localized activity of Rac1 and Cdc42 may be required for neurite extension, because the expression of constitutively active mutants of Rac1 and Cdc42 in the whole cell area inhibited NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, at the neurite tips, Rac1 and Cdc42 exhibited different modes of activation with respect to their distribution. Our data indicated that Rac1 and Cdc42 were activated by a common GEF(s) during an early stage of the activation phase. Given that, the difference between Rac1- and Cdc42-activated areas could be attributed to the differential localization between Rac1-specific and Cdc42-specific GAPs. Plasmids—The prototype probes for Rac1 and Cdc42, used in our previous study (9.Itoh R.E. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), consisted of the Cdc42/Rac1 interacting-binding (CRIB) domain of Pak, Rac1 and Cdc42, a pair of green fluorescent protein mutants, and the carboxyl-terminal region of Ki-Ras4B, respectively. We refer to these probes as Raichu-Rac1/Ki-Ras-CT(1011x) and Raichu-Cdc42/Ki-Ras-CT(1054x). In this study, we primarily used pRaichu-Rac1(1026x) and pRaichu-Cdc42(1061x), which encoded another type of Rac1/Cdc42 probes fused to the carboxyl-terminal region of Rac1 (amino acids 172-192) and Cdc42 (amino acids 171-191), respectively; these probes have been described in detail elsewhere (10.Yoshizaki H.

Kurokawa K. Matsuda M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 859-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was used as a Raichu-Ras expression vector. The cDNAs for Rac1-V12, Rac1-N17, Cdc42-V12, Cdc42-N17, and Ras-N17 were inserted into the cloning site of the pCAGGS-derived pIRM21-FLAG expression vector, which contained the FLAG tag and an internal ribosomal entry site followed by the cDNA of a red fluorescent protein, dsFP593 (9.Itoh R.E. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), at the 5′- and 3′-side of the cloning site, respectively. The CRIB domain of N-WASP (amino acids 124 to 274) (12.Ono Y. Nakanishi H. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Satoh-Horikawa K. Mandai K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3050-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was also subcloned into the pIRM21-FLAG vector. pIRM21-CdGAP has been described previously (9.Itoh R.E. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Reagents—PC12 cells were grown in RPMI medium containing 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. NGF and U73122 were purchased from Calbiochem. LY294002 and U0126 were obtained from Sigma. Imaging—PC12 cells were plated on polyethyleneimine- (Fig. 1) or collagen- (except for Fig. 1) coated 35-mm glass-base dishes (Asahi Techno Glass Co.), and then transfected with the pRaichu vectors using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). After recovery, the medium was changed to phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for imaging. Cells were starved for 6 h when necessary, and then treated with 50 ng/ml NGF. For long-term observation (Fig. 1), the medium was covered with mineral oil (Sigma) to preclude evaporation. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with 20 μm LY294002, 20 μm U0126, or 2.5 μm U73122 for 30 min prior to the addition of NGF. Thereafter, cells were imaged with an IX70 inverted microscope (Olympus) equipped with a Cool SNAP-HQ cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific) controlled by MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging), as described previously (13.Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Matsuda M. Nature. 2001; 411: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Filters used for the dual-emission imaging studies were obtained from Omega Optical, Inc.: an XF1071 (440AF21) excitation filter, an XF2034 (455DRLP) dichroic mirror, and two emission filters (XF3075 (480AF30) for CFP and XF3079 (535AF26) for YFP) were used. Cells were illuminated with a 75-watt Xenon lamp through a 12% ND filter and a ×60 or ×100 oil immersion objective lens. Exposure times for 4 × 4 binning were 400 ms to obtain images of CFP and YFP, and 100 ms to obtain a differential interference contrast image. After background subtraction, the YFP/CFP ratio image was created with MetaMorph software and the image was used to represent FRET efficiency. In the cotransfection experiments, pIRM21-Flag-RacN17, pIRM21-Flag-Cdc42N17, pIRM21-CdGAP, or pIRM21-Flag-N-WASP-CRIB was introduced along with the Raichu vectors. The expression levels of the dominant-negative mutants and CdGAP were monitored by the red fluorescence of FP593, which was translated from the internal ribosomal entry site on the mRNAs of the dominant negative mutants and CdGAP. Thus, we were able to choose cells in a range from one-half to 2-fold of the averaged RFP intensity for obtaining FRET images. In Vitro Analysis of Rac1/Cdc42 Activation—The measurement of Rac1 and Cdc42 activity was carried out by Bos' pull-down method according to Yasui et al. (14.Yasui H. Katoh H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15298-15305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing GST-PAK-CRIB. The cleared lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C. The washed beads were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, and the bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Rac1 or anti-Cdc42 monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories). Neurite Extension Assays—Plasmids expressing the constitutively active or dominant negative mutant of Rac1 or Cdc42, CdGAP, and N-WASP CRIB were transfected into PC12 cells along with pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). Quantification of neurite outgrowth by 2.5 days of treatment with NGF was performed as described previously (15.Nakamura T. Komiya M. Sone K. Hirose E. Gotoh N. Morii H. Ohta Y. Mori N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8721-8734Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Long-term Observation of Rac1 and Cdc42 Activities during the Course of NGF-induced Neurite Extension—By using FRET-based in vivo probes, we visualized Rac1 and Cdc42 activities in NGF-treated PC12 cells for 30 h; this experiment provided the first direct information about the spatio-temporal changes of the activities of Rac1 and Cdc42 during the course of neurite outgrowth upon NGF stimulation (Fig. 1, A and B). PC12 cells expressing Raichu-Rac1 or Raichu-Cdc42 were imaged for YFP and CFP at an excitation wavelength of 440 nm. These two images were used to create a YFP/CFP ratio image, by which FRET efficiency was represented. Because the FRET efficiency of these Raichu probes correlates with the GTP/GDP ratio of Rac1 or Cdc42 (9.Itoh R.E. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), their activities can be visualized by this YFP/CFP ratio image. Undifferentiated PC12 cells having round shapes showed only slight activity changes of Rac1 and Cdc42 (Fig. 1, A and B, 0 h). Upon NGF treatment, these cells began to spread and exhibit multiple protrusions with a rapid cycling of extension and retraction; 12 h later, some protrusions became stable neurites and continued to extend. During this outgrowth process, activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 was observed mostly at the newly protruding tips of neurites (Fig. 1, A and B). The characteristics of this localized activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 was further examined by another set of time-lapse experiments conducted at shorter intervals (Fig. 1, C and D). At 24 h after NGF addition, PC12 cells expressing the Raichu probes were imaged every 2 to 3 min to precisely trace the movement of the neurite tips; which showed prominent activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 when they were protruding (arrowheads in Fig. 1, C and D), although some differences in the activated areas were observed between Rac1 and Cdc42 (described below in detail). In contrast, the retracting protrusion (arrow) and non-motile areas of the cell bodies exhibited no remarkable activation of Rac1 and Cdc42. Rac1 and Cdc42 Activation Patterns Were Spatially Different in NGF-induced Neurites—Differences in the spatial patterns of activation were reproducibly observed between Rac1 and Cdc42 when neurites with similar shapes were analyzed (Fig. 2, A and B). Highly activated areas of Rac1 tended to spread over the distal half of the neurite tips (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, marked activation of Cdc42 was mostly concentrated at the distal end of the neurite tips; in many cases, potent Cdc42 activation was confined to microspikes projecting from the neurite tips (Fig. 2B). In Fig. 2C, the mode of Rac1/Cdc42 activation at the neurite tips is classified into four categories. A histogram plotting the neurite number in each category showed that the Cdc42 activation mode was significantly different from that of Rac1. This difference between Rac1- and Cdc42-activated areas at the protrusions was already observed at 4 h after the addition of NGF (Fig. 2, D and E). The localization of activated Rho GTPases were primarily determined by their carboxyl-terminal regions (16.Michaelson D. Silletti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Thus, the Raichu-Rac1 and Raichu-Cdc42 probes used here were fused to the authentic carboxyl termini to bring the monitor to the membrane compartments where the endogenous Rac1 and Cdc42 should be activated. Although both Raichu-Rac1 and Raichu-Cdc42 were localized at the plasma membrane and endomembrane, Raichu-Cdc42 were preferentially localized at the endomembrane compartment (10.Yoshizaki H. Ohba Y. Kurokawa K. Itoh R.E. Nakamura T. Mochizuki N. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that the different modes of activation described above resulted from the differences in subcellular localization of these FRET probes. To exclude this possibility, another type of probes were used for comparison: Raichu-Rac1/Ki-Ras-CT and Raichu-Cdc42/Ki-Ras-CT harbor the carboxyl-terminal region of Ki-Ras, which delivers probes primarily to the plasma membrane of HeLa cells (10.Yoshizaki H. Ohba Y. Kurokawa K. Itoh R.E. Nakamura T. Mochizuki N. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). No significant difference in localization was observed between these two probes having the Ki-Ras carboxyl termini in PC12 cells (data not shown). With these probes fused to Ki-Ras-CT, we obtained essentially the same results as with the probes with the authentic carboxyl termini; there were clear differences between the Rac1- and Cdc42-activated areas (Fig. 2, F and G). Early Response of Rac1 and Cdc42 Activities upon NGF Stimulation—Using the Raichu probes, we further examined the early phase of Rac1/Cdc42 activation in PC12 cells immediately after NGF addition. The representative time sequences of the FRET images are shown in Fig. 3, A and B. Around 3-5 min after NGF addition, both Rac1 and Cdc42 were diffusely activated in broad areas at the cell peripheries (Fig. 3, A and B, 2-4 min); this contrasted with their localized activation during the outgrowth process depicted in Figs. 1 and 2. It should be noted that this widespread activation was transient, after which, recurrent activation was observed at the tips of the protrusions (Fig. 3, A and B, 10-30 min). To demonstrate the time course of the activity changes more quantitatively, we calculated the YFP/CFP ratios for Rac1 and Cdc42 averaged over the whole cell, and plotted them for three samples (Fig. 3, D and E). The first peak in Rac1/Cdc42 activation appeared primarily 3-5 min after NGF stimulation, whereas the succeeding peaks appeared stochastically in each cell. This observation was compared with the result of the pull-down assay, which showed that Rac1 and Cdc42 peaked ∼2.5 min after the addition of NGF (Fig. 4); we thus concluded that this peak was most likely produced by widespread and synchronized activation in numerous cells. However, as shown by FRET imaging, the peaks following the first peak were more localized (Fig. 3, A and B) and unsynchronized (Fig. 3, D and E), and thus were not detected by the pull-down method (Fig. 4 and Refs. 14.Yasui H.

In contrast to the localized and intermittent activation of Rac1 and Cdc42, Ras activation was observed throughout the cells and was sustained with a gradual decrease over 30 min (Fig. 3, C and F).Fig. 4NGF-induced activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 detected by a pull-down method. Serum-starved PC12 cells were treated with NGF for the indicated periods and examined by the Bos' pull-down method using GST-PAK-CRIB. Proteins bound to GST-PAK-CRIB and total lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Rac1 (A) or anti-Cdc42 (B) antibody. Experiments were repeated three times. Average values are shown in C with standard deviations, as the number of times they increased in comparison to the values of serum-starved cells at 0 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we asked whether or not these localized and repeated activation-inactivation cycles of Rac1/Cdc42 at neurite tips might have any role in the induction of neurite outgrowth. To answer this question, PC12 cells were transfected with constitutively active or dominant-negative mutants of Rac1 and Cdc42, followed by NGF treatment for 2.5 days. The cells transfected with green fluorescent protein alone had efficiently developed neurites by 2.5 days of treatment with NGF (Fig. 5A); the proportion of neurite-bearing cells in green fluorescent protein-transfected cells (control) in the presence of NGF was 50% (Fig. 5D). The dominant-negative mutants of Rac1 and Cdc42 were potent inhibitors of NGF-induced neurite extension, as shown previously (19.Chen X.Q. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19901-19905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Of note, only 8% of the Rac1-V12 expressing cells, and only 7% of the Cdc42-V12 expressing cells, bore neurites in the presence of NGF. Cells expressing Rac1-V12 became flattened and had membrane ruffles (Fig. 5B), whereas Cdc42-V12 expressing cells produced a large number of microspikes around the cell periphery (Fig. 5C). These morphologies were essentially the same as those observed in the absence of NGF (20.Katoh H. Yasui H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7378-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence of constitutively active Rac1 and Cdc42 throughout the cells also abrogated NGF-induced neurite extension, as did dominant-negative Rac1 and Cdc42. These results, taken together, suggest that localized activation of both Rac1 and Cdc42 is required for neurite outgrowth in NGF-treated PC12 cells. PI 3-Kinase Was Required for the Early Phase Activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 upon NGF Stimulation—To investigate the mechanism of Rac1/Cdc42 activation using these probes, we developed a sensitive method to quantify Rac1/Cdc42 activation. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the Rac1/Cdc42 probes near the center of the cells basically did not respond to NGF stimulation, and thus lowered the YFP/CFP ratios when they were averaged over the whole cell. First, in each sample, we determined the average ratio before NGF stimulation and used that ratio as the reference value. Then, we measured the percentage of the area in which the local YFP/CFP ratio exceeded the reference value by at least 10%. Fig. 6, A and B, represents the results of this procedure for the samples analyzed in Fig. 3, D and E, respectively. The values of the first peaks in Fig. 6, A and B, were increased by 10-20% over the reference value, although the corresponding increases in the first peaks in Fig. 3, D and E, were only 3-6%. By using this procedure of quantification (i.e. the percentage of activated area), we searched for an upstream regulator of Rac1 and Cdc42, and found that PI 3-kinase regulated the early phase of Rac1/Cdc42 activation in NGF-stimulated PC12 cells. In the control cells, the activated area was increased by 15 (Rac1) or 10% (Cdc42) upon NGF stimulation (Fig. 6, C and D, lane 1). In contrast, in the PC12 cells pretreated with LY294002, the percentage of Rac1- and Cdc42-activated area was significantly reduced (lane 2). This reduction indicates that the widespread activation corresponding to the first peak was largely dependent on PI 3-kinase, in agreement with the results of biochemical studies (14.Yasui H. Katoh H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15298-15305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18.Nusser N. Gosmanova E. Zheng Y. Tigyi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35840-35846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Notably, the localized Rac1/Cdc42 activation corresponding to the recurrent peaks shown in Fig. 6, A and B, was also inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, although there remained some degree of Rac1 activation independent of the PI 3-kinase activity (Fig. 6, E and F). The other NGF/Trk signaling cascades, i.e. the Ras/MEK/Erk pathway and the phospholipase C-γ1 pathway, have also been shown to contribute to NGF-induced neurite outgrowth (21.Patapoutian A. Reichardt L.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 22.Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). However, in cells pretreated with a MEK inhibitor (U0126) or a phospholipase C-γ1 inhibitor (U73122), the observed increases in Rac1/Cdc42 activation were comparable with those in the control cells (Fig. 6, C and D, lanes 3 and 4). Relationship between the Activation Mechanisms of Rac1 and Cdc42 upon NGF Stimulation—To further analyze the mechanism of Rac1/Cdc42 activation during the early phase of NGF-induced morphological change, we used dominant negative mutants of Rac1 and Cdc42. FRET imaging with Raichu-Rac1 showed that Cdc42-N17 inhibited Rac1 activation upon NGF stimulation, as did Rac1-N17 (Fig. 7A). Also, NGF-induced Cdc42 activation was significantly reduced by both Rac1-N17 and Cdc42-N17 (Fig. 7B). The most likely explanations for this observation are as follows. The dominant-negative mutants used here sequester their cognate GEFs (23.Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar), and many GEFs activate both Rac1 and Cdc42 (7.Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar); therefore, one possibility is that Rac1 and Cdc42 were activated by the same GEF following NGF stimulation. A similar possibility was pointed out in the case of the bradykinin treatment of PC12 cells (24.van Leeuwen F.N. van Delft S. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Alternatively, there might be a positive feedback loop between Rac1 and Cdc42, and thus the inhibition of either Rac1 or Cdc42 would block the activation of both. We tried to distinguish between these two possibilities by specifically inhibiting Cdc42 activation. CdGAP (25.Lamarche-Vane N. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29172-29177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which has been shown to act on Cdc42 but not on Rac1 in cultured cells (9.Itoh R.E. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), effectively inhibited Cdc42 activation upon NGF stimulation in PC12 cells (Fig. 7C). However, in the presence or absence of CdGAP, a comparable level of Rac1 activation was observed following NGF stimulation (Fig. 7D). Furthermore, NGF-induced Rac1 activation was not inhibited at all by the expression of the CRIB domain of N-WASP (Fig. 7, D and E), which has been shown to specifically bind to GTP-Cdc42 (26.Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) and inhibit the downstream signaling of Cdc42 in fibroblasts (12.Ono Y. Nakanishi H. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Satoh-Horikawa K. Mandai K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3050-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The ability of N-WASP CRIB to block the downstream signaling of Cdc42 in PC12 cells was confirmed by neurite extension assay; the expression of N-WASP CRIB reduced NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by half, as did CdGAP expression (Fig. 7F). To assess the possible nonspecific effect by overexpression, we monitored NGF-induced changes of Ras activity in PC12 cells expressing the dominant-negative mutants or CdGAP (Fig. 7G). The expression of Rac1-N17, Cdc42-N17, CdGAP, and N-WASP CRIB did not interfere with NGF-induced Ras activation, indicating that their effects on Rac1 and Cdc42 were specific. Taken together, Cdc42 activation was not required for NGF-induced Rac1 activation in this system, suggesting that the early phase activation of both Rac1 and Cdc42 upon NGF stimulation can be attributed to the same GEF. FRET imaging of Rac1 and Cdc42 activity possesses a unique advantage over the conventional biochemical methods in that time-dependent change and spatial distribution can be traced in individual cells. A biochemical study of PC12 cells has already detected a single peak of Rac1 activation immediately after the addition of NGF (14.Yasui H. Katoh H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15298-15305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, in single-cell recordings using the FRET probes, intermittent activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 following NGF treatment was also observed. Immediately after NGF addition, Rac1 and Cdc42 were transiently activated in broad areas at the cell periphery, and thereafter, activation localized at the neurite tips was recurrently observed. This finding of localized activation during the extension process may help to explain why expression of Rac1-V12 and Cdc42-V12 inhibited NGF-induced neurite outgrowth (Fig. 5). A similar failure of the constitutively active mutants of Rac1 and Cdc42 to induce neurites was reported in the absence of ligands in PC12 cells (20.Katoh H. Yasui H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7378-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 27.Daniels R.H. Hall P.S. Bokoch G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and other neuronal cells (28.Sarner S. Kozma R. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We propose that localization cues, including the localized Rac1/Cdc42 activity shown here, are necessary for neurite formation; as was discussed recently (27.Daniels R.H. Hall P.S. Bokoch G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Another possible explanation is that the Rho GTPase signaling pathway has a cyclic mode of action, and constitutively active mutants may block this cycle (4.Luo L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), although the underlying mechanisms have yet to be described. The Raichu-Cdc42 probe detected significant activation of Cdc42 upon NGF stimulation; this finding is consistent with the essential role of N-WASP, a Cdc42-specific effector, in NGF-dependent neurite extension in PC12 cells (29.Banzai Y. Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11987-11992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, a study using a pull-down analysis has reported that Cdc42 is not significantly activated upon NGF treatment (14.Yasui H. Katoh H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15298-15305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This is probably because the activation of Cdc42 was more localized than that of Rac1. The pull-down assay, which monitors averaged changes in GTP-Cdc42, may not be sensitive enough to detect Cdc42 activation localized at the periphery of the cell body. Another unexpected feature of NGF-induced Rac1/Cdc42 activation revealed in this study was its intermittent character, although this finding agrees with a previous observation that neurites do not grow continuously, but often pause before re-starting extension (30.Gordon-Weeks R.R. Neuronal Growth Cones. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2000Crossref Google Scholar). This intermittent activation at the motile tips was dependent on PI 3-kinase as well as the initial robust activation immediately after NGF treatment. Neurite tips are accumulation sites for both F-actin (14.Yasui H. Katoh H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15298-15305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and PI 3-kinase activity (31.Shi S.H. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 63-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), the latter detected by anti-phospho-Akt staining. Recent studies have shown that positive feedback loops linking increases in PI(3,4,5)P3, activation of Rac1/Cdc42, and actin polymerization are important for neutrophil or hippocampal neuron polarity (31.Shi S.H. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 63-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 32.Wang F. Herzmark P. Weiner O.D. Srinivasan S. Servant G. Bourne H.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 33.Weiner O.D. Neilsen P.O. Prestwich G.D. Kirschner M.W. Cantley L.C. Bourne H.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, a similar positive feedback loop, which might frequently be interrupted by a shortage of monomeric actin or the turnover of lipid products of PI 3-kinase, might be a driving force localizing morphological changes and regulatory signals. In contrast to the localized and intermittent activation of Rac1 and Cdc42, Ras activation in NGF-treated PC12 cells was detected diffusely at the plasma membrane and had a longer duration (Fig. 3 and Ref. 13.Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Matsuda M. Nature. 2001; 411: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In line with diffuse Ras activation, it has been shown that the expression of constitutively active Ras does not inhibit, but rather promotes neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (34.Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Cell. 1985; 42: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). This concurs with a bulk of evidence implicating the Ras/Raf/Erk pathway in the activation of the transcription/translation of proteins required for neurite extension (35.Markus A. Patel T.D. Snider W.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In this case, the site of Ras activation is remote from the site of action, whereas we assume that the sites of activation and action of Rac1/Cdc42 are regionally confined by the positive-feedback loop described above. Raichu-Rac1 and Raichu-Cdc42 monitor the balance between GEF and GAP activities at the membranes, but they are insensitive to Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor activity (9.Itoh R.E. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Another type of FRET probe, Raichu-CRIB-X, in which FRET inversely correlates with the local concentration of endogenous GTP-Rac1 and GTP-Cdc42, enables Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor activity to be considered (9.Itoh R.E. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Observations using Raichu-CRIB-X in NGF-treated PC12 cells (data not shown) were consistent with the findings obtained with Raichu-Rac1 and Raichu-Cdc42 suggesting that Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor did not contribute significantly to the regulation of Rac1/Cdc42 activity upon NGF stimulation in PC12 cells. As shown above, FRET imaging is a promising tool for unraveling linkages between neuronal morphogenesis and intracellular signaling. However, many of these neuronal events take a day or more, and at present, long-term imaging remains difficult to perform. In our experience, neurite formation could be frequently impaired by accumulated photo-damage because of repeated exposure to intense light, as described previously (36.Svoboda K. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 93-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In addition, substantial increases in the basal fluorescent intensity emitted by YFP and CFP, possibly because of slow folding of the proteins, were sometimes observed during the long-term recordings; these drifts might be accompanied by unreliable changes in the YFP/CFP ratios. For wider application in neuroscience, further improvements of the current methods will be desirable. Experiments with dominant-negative mutants strongly suggested that Rac1 and Cdc42 were activated by a common GEF(s) during early phase activation. Rac1/Cdc42 activation was inhibited by LY294002, thus this putative GEF should be PI 3-kinase-dependent. This conclusion is in line with the findings from previous biochemical studies demonstrating the PI 3-kinase dependence of Rac1 activation (14.Yasui H. Katoh H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15298-15305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18.Nusser N. Gosmanova E. Zheng Y. Tigyi G. J. Biol.

Assuming that the same GEF or GEFs activate(s) Rac1 and Cdc42 upon NGF stimulation, the difference in Rac1- and Cdc42-activated areas observed in this study could be attributable to differential localization between one or more Rac1-specific GAPs and Cdc42-specific GAPs. Our previous study using Raichu-Rac1/Cdc42 in HT-1080 fibroblasts showed a similar difference in the distributions of active Rac1 and Cdc42 during cell migration; Rac1 activity was highest immediately behind the leading edge, whereas Cdc42 activity was most prominent at the tip of the leading edge (9.Itoh R.E. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). If this type of difference between Rac1- and Cdc42-activated areas is generally observed in the morphological changes of various cells, it is an intriguing question whether or not there exists a common underlying mechanism. A future study combining FRET imaging and function-interference techniques should help clarify the molecular network of spatio-temporal regulation of cellular morphogenesis. We thank T.

Until recently, adipose tissue has been thought of as largely a passive energy storage depot for periods of nutritional excess. It releases stored energy in the form of free fatty acids and glycerol upon hydrolysis of esterified lipids by lipases that are under hormonal control (1.Holm C. Osterlund T. Laurell H. Contreras J.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The cloning of leptin from adipose tissue and the subsequent discoveries that adipose tissue also releases several other protein factors have changed our view on the function of this tissue. It is now recognized that adipose tissue is also an active endocrine organ, and the expression patterns of these secreted factors are under both nutritional and hormonal controls (2.Ahima R.S.

It is a secreted protein selectively expressed in adipose tissue, liver, and placenta (5.Kim I. Kim H.G. Kim H. Kim H.H. Park S.K. Uhm C.S. Lee Z.H. Koh G.Y. Biochem.

Mouse Angptl4 is composed of 410 amino acids that include an N-terminal signal sequence, a coiled-coil domain, and a fibrinogen-like motif at the carboxyl terminus. Such domain organization is preserved in both angiopoietins and angiopoietin-like proteins.Transcriptional regulation of Angptl4 is rather complex. Several transcription factors have been identified as having a role in Angptl4 transcription, including two members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor family of transcription factors, PPARα and PPARγ (6.Kersten S. Mandard S. Tan N.S. Escher P. Metzger D. Chambon P. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Biol.

Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Jiang C. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2002; 34: 765-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As a transcriptional target of PPARγ, Angptl4 has been hypothesized to play a role in the modulation of adipogenesis, insulin sensitivity, or energy metabolism (7.Yoon J.C. Chickering T.W. Rosen E.D. Dussault B. Qin Y. Soukas A. Friedman J.M. Holmes W.E. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5343-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Mice heterozygous for PPARγ knockout have reduced Angptl4 mRNA expression in adipose tissue, where PPARγ is normally abundantly expressed. Mice with PPARα deficiency also exhibit undetectable Angptl4 mRNA levels in liver, where PPARα is normally abundantly expressed. Conversely, when mice are treated with a potent agonist of PPARα, WY14643, Angptl4 transcription is increased (6.Kersten S. Mandard S. Tan N.S. Escher P. Metzger D. Chambon P. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28488-28493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In vitro, treatment of NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing PPARγ with its agonist, pioglitazone, caused an increase of at least 10-fold in Angptl4 mRNA levels in the absence of protein synthesis (7.Yoon J.C. Chickering T.W. Rosen E.D. Dussault B. Qin Y. Soukas A. Friedman J.M. Holmes W.E. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5343-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). PPARα and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α also cause the synergistic activation of Angptl4 transcription in cardiomyocytes (8.Belanger A.J. Lu H. Date T. Liu L.X. Vincent K.A. Akita G.Y. Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Jiang C. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2002; 34: 765-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In a recent report, Angptl4 was found to be one of nine genes silenced by methylation in human gastric cancers (9.Kaneda A. Kaminishi M. Yanagihara K. Sugimura T. Ushijima T. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6645-6650PubMed Google Scholar). In aggregate, these data suggest that Angptl4 may play a variety of roles in vivo, ranging from adipogenesis and angiogenesis to carcinogenesis (10.Le Jan S. Amy C. Cazes A. Monnot C. Lamande N. Favier J. Philippe J. Sibony M. Gasc J.M. Corvol P. Germain S. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 1521-1528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Because both ischemic tissue and solid tumor tissue are in a hypoxic state, Angptl4 could be playing a shared role of modulating angiogenesis under both conditions.The expression of angpt4 is also under nutritional and hormonal control. Under fasting conditions, transcription of Angptl4 in both liver and adipose tissue is induced independently of the presence of PPARα (6.Kersten S. Mandard S. Tan N.S. Escher P. Metzger D. Chambon P. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28488-28493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Circulating levels of Angptl4 are also increased in genetically obese mice (ob/ob or db/db) that lack leptin signaling (7.Yoon J.C. Chickering T.W. Rosen E.D. Dussault B. Qin Y. Soukas A. Friedman J.M. Holmes W.E. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5343-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). However, in rodents fed a high-fat diet, circulating levels of Angptl4 are reduced, providing further evidence that Angptl4 may play a role in response to the availability of nutrients (6.Kersten S. Mandard S. Tan N.S. Escher P. Metzger D. Chambon P. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28488-28493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar).The function of Angptl4 is not completely understood. Recently, it was reported that Angptl4 is a potent hyperlipidemia-inducing factor and an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase (11.Yoshida K. Shimizugawa T. Ono M. Furukawa H. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1770-1772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). To obtain better insight on the structural basis of Angptl4 function, we have now determined that full-length Angptl4 is an oligomer, similar to angiopoietin 1 (12.Davis S. Papadopoulos N. Aldrich T.H. Maisonpierre P.C. Huang T. Kovac L. Xu A. Leidich R. Radziejewska E. Rafique A. Goldberg J. Jain V. Bailey K. Karow M. Fandl J. Samuelsson S.J. Ioffe E. Rudge J.S. Daly T.J. Radziejewski C. Yancopoulos G.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In contrast to angiopoietin 1, however, Angptl4 undergoes regulated proteolysis to release its carboxyl-terminal fibrinogen-like domain both in vitro and in vivo, the first example of proteolysis-mediated processing of a member of this family of proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—All PCR primers were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys or IDT Technologies. All restriction endonucleases as well as PNGase F were from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Taq DNA polymerase and protease inhibitor mixture tablets were from Roche (Indianapolis, IN). ECL-Western blotting reagents and Superdex 200 column (10/30) were from Amersham Biosciences. TALON Metal Affinity resin was from BD Biosciences Clontech. Polyclonal antibodies against Angptl4 were generated in rabbits by Covance Research Products, Inc. (Denver, PA). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Gemini Bio-Products (Woodland, CA). SuperScript II RNase H– reverse transcriptase was from Invitrogen.Cloning of Rat Angptl4 and Construction of Adenoviral Expression Vectors—To amplify cDNA encoding full-length Angptl4 from rat adipose tissue, first-strand cDNA was generated by reverse transcription of total RNA using SuperScript II RNase H– reverse transcriptase. Both full-length Angptl4 and the amino-terminal coiled-coil domain of Angptl4 were amplified using the same 5′ primer, CL307. It contains an XhoI site (underlined) for in-frame subcloning into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (-)/Myc-HisA and has the following sequences: 5′-CCGCTCGAGAATCATGCGCTGCGCTCCG-3′; the 3′ ends of the full-length and the amino-terminal coiled-coil domain of Angptl4 were amplified by primers CL379 and CL380, each containing a HindIII site (underlined) for in-frame subcloning into the same vector. The sequences are: CL379, 5′-CCC AAG CTT AGA GGC TGC TGT AGC CTC CAT G-3′; CL380, 5′-CCC AAG CTT CTG GGT CAT CTT GGG AAG-3′. Clones containing inserts from primer pairs CL307-CL379 and CL307-CL380 were verified by sequencing analysis and transient transfection.To generate adenoviruses encoding the N-terminal coiled-coil domain (Ad-Angptl4(S)-myc) or full-length (Ad-Angptl4(L)-myc) rat Angptl4, the AdEasy system was used, with a slight modification (13.He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3229) Google Scholar). Briefly, to facilitate detection of virally produced Angptl4 proteins, inserts in the pcDNA3.1(–)/Myc-His vector were removed along with the carboxyl-terminal c-myc tag as a PmeI fragment and ligated to the EcoRV site of pShuttle-CMV. The resulting plasmid was then linearized with PmeI, purified using the MinElute Kit (QIAGEN), and co-electroporated with pAdEasy1into BJ5183 cells to generate recombinant viral DNA. Recombinants were screened by running an aliquot of undigested miniprep DNA of 2-ml cultures from KanR colonies. PacI digestion was then performed to confirm the presence of inserts. Typically, this procedure yields ∼50% recombinants. Viral DNA was transformed into DH5α cells and propagated before being used for transfection into low passage 293 cells as described previously (14.Huang L. Wang Z. Li C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6343-6349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar).Purification of Angptl4 Protein—Conditioned media with or without serum from 293 cells infected wirh Ad-Angptl4(L)-myc virus were collected and filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. Buffering capacity and salt concentrations were adjusted to 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 300 mm NaCl by diluting conditioned media with 1/10 volume of 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 3 M NaCl. 5 μl of TALON Metal Affinity resin was pre-equilibrated with 50 ml of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 300 mm NaCl), before 1000 ml of conditioned medium was applied to the resin. Medium and resin were rocked gently at 4 °C overnight. Resin was washed with 3 × 50 ml of wash buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 6 × 5 ml of wash buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Fractions containing Angptl4 protein were pooled, concentrated using Centriprep concentrators (Amicon Inc, Beverly, MA), and further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (10/30). Fractions at each stage of purification were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining and/or Western blotting to confirm the presence of Angptl4 protein.Generation of Polyclonal Antibodies against Angptl4 —Recombinant Angptl4 was prepared from mammalian cells (antigen 1) or bacteria (antigens 2 and 3) for generation of rabbit polyclonal antibodies using different expression systems. Antigen 1 was purified from processed carboxyl terminus of Angptl4 from conditioned medium containing 5% FBS of Ad-Angptl4(L)-myc virus-infected 293 cells as described above. Partially purified Angptl4 protein was separated on preparative 12% SDS-PAGE, and the Angptl4 was band cut out after staining with Coomassie brilliant blue. Gel slice was homogenized and injected into female New Zealand White rabbits for antibody production. Antigen 2 was generated using a pET expression system (Novagen). A 512-bp cDNA sequence encoding the carboxyl fibrinogen-like domain of Angptl4 was PCR-amplified and cloned into the SmaI site of pET-44b vector (Novagen). Fusion protein was expressed in bacteria and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified protein was also used for injection into rabbit. Antigen 3 was generated using a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of Angptl4 as follows. Full-length Angptl4 cDNA (minus the signal peptide) was fused to the carboxyl terminus of glutathione S-transferase and expressed in bacteria, following standard methods. Fusion protein was run on preparative SDS-PAGE and cut out after staining with Coomassie blue. Gel slice was homogenized and injected into female New Zealand White rabbits for antibody production. In all cases, specificity of the antibodies was determined by serial dilution of antigen, by comparison with the signal recognized by the c-myc monoclonal antibody, and by comparison with pre-immune serum. All blots shown are recombinant Angptl4 expressed after transient transfection or adenoviral infection.Expression and Detection of Angptl4 in 293 Cells—293 cells were cultured in 6-well plates until 80–90% confluent. Culture medium was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with or without 5% FBS before adenoviruses encoding Angptl4 were added at a multiplicity of infection of 100. Multiplicity of infection was determined based on the virus titer, obtained by serial dilution of viruses and infections of individual wells of 96-well plates. Typically, titer of purified viruses ranges from 109 to 1010 plaque-forming units per milliliter. Forty-eight hours after virus infection, conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged to obtain supernatant. 200 μl of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) was added to the remaining cells, and 20 μl lysate was mixed with 2× reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer (containing 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol) for analysis. Unless otherwise indicated, no protease inhibitors were used during purification of Angptl4 protein from the supernatant of 293 cells. β-Mercaptoethanol was added in SDS-PAGE loading buffer in all blots except for Figs. 2B and 3C, where lanes are labeled “non-reduced.” For Western blotting, samples were incubated with SDS loading buffer either with (reduced) or without (nonreduced) 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll). Membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.9% NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20). Angptl4 protein was detected with a c-myc-HRP antibody (Roche Diagnostic, Inc.) or polyclonal antibodies as described above using the ECL-Western blotting kit from Amersham Biosciences. After detection, membrane was exposed to Blue Bio film (Denville Scientific Inc., Metuchen, NJ) for about 30 s.Fig. 3Coiled-coil domain of Angptl4 is sufficient to form oligomeric structure similar to full-length Angptl4. A, adenovirus vectors encoding full-length (Ad-Angptl4(L)-myc) or N-terminal coiled-coil domain of Angptl4 (Ad-Angptl4(S)-myc).

The elution positions of molecular mass markers (Dextran, 440 kDa, 67 kDa, and 13.7 kDa) are marked on the blot. Both forms of Angptl4 are composed of various sizes of high molecular weight complexes and elute as broad peaks. C, migration of full-length Angptl4 (Lmyc) or its coiled-coil domain (Smyc) under reducing or nonreducing conditions in SDS-PAGE. Samples loaded are viral supernatant of 293 cells infected with full-length Angptl4 (Lmyc), its coiled-coil domain (Smyc), or a control virus encoding GFP, indicated by a minus sign (–). Angptl4 protein was detected by the c-myc monoclonal antibody. Molecular mass markers are indicated on the left. Experiments were repeated for more than three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Size Exclusion Chromatography of Angptl4 Protein—A Superdex 200 column (10/30) was equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was first calibrated by measuring the absorbance of commercially available protein standards. 200 μl of conditioned medium (containing ∼0.5 μg of Angptl4 protein) was then applied to the same column. Because of the lower expression levels, conditioned media containing recombinant Angptl4(S)-myc was first concentrated 5-fold using Centriprep (Amicon) before column loading. Fractions of 300 μl were collected, and each fraction was analyzed by dot blotting or Western blotting, using c-myc-HRP for detection. To detect recombinant Angptl4 by dot blotting, membrane containing applied samples from each fraction was first treated with PBS containing 0.25% H2O2 for 30 min to render peroxidase inactive in samples. The filter was then washed with PBS 3 times for 5 min each. Blocking and antibody incubation were then carried out as for Western blotting.Adenovirus Infusion into Mice to Overexpress Angptl4 in Vivo—Adenoviruses encoding Angptl4 (Ad-Angptl4(L)-myc) or green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) were infused via the jugular vein at a dosage of 1 × 1011 virus particles/mouse, as described previously (14.Huang L. Wang Z. Li C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6343-6349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 15.Ge H. Huang L. Pourbahrami T. Li C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45898-45903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Four days after virus injection, blood samples were taken from the tail vein to detect the levels of virally produced Angptl4 protein by Western blotting analysis. Mice were anesthetized and sacrificed for tissue removal and characterization. Animal use was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.Time Course of Serum-induced Angptl4 Processing—293 cells were cultured in 6-well plates until 80–90% confluent. Cells were then washed once with PBS and medium was replaced with 2 ml of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum; adenoviruses encoding full-length Angptl4 were added to cells at a multiplicity of infection of 100. Twenty-four hours after virus infection, FBS was added to cells to a final concentration of 5%. FBS was applied to all wells except one, which was used as control. Conditioned medium was collected at different time points from 0 to 48 h after addition of FBS and used directly for Western blotting to detect recombinant Angptl4. No protease inhibitors were added to media at any stages of Angptl4 expression.To determine whether serum-activated proteolytic activity is released into conditioned media and whether adenovirus infection per se causes release of nonspecific proteolytic activity, supernatant was collected from 293 cells cultured in serum-containing media, with or without infection by the control adenovirus Ad-GFP. About 0.1 μg of Angptl4 protein was then incubated with collected media at 37 °C for 24 h and used for Western blotting with c-myc monoclonal antibody. Cells infected with Ad-Angptl4(L)-myc were also cultured in serum-containing media in the absence or presence of complete protease inhibitor mixture to determine whether processing of recombinant Angptl4 might be inhibited.Protein Deglycosylation—Angptl4 protein (about 1 μg) was denatured in 1× glycoprotein denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol) at 100 °C for 10 min. One unit of PNGase F was added and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in 1× G7 Reaction Buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5), supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40. After treatment of the samples with PNGase F, Angptl4 protein was detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.RESULTSAngptl4 Is Evolutionarily Conserved between Rodents and Humans—Mouse and human Angptl4 share 75% nucleotide identity and 77% amino acid identity (7.Yoon J.C. Chickering T.W. Rosen E.D. Dussault B. Qin Y. Soukas A. Friedman J.M. Holmes W.E. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5343-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). However, mouse Angptl4 contains 410 amino acids, whereas that of humans contains only 405 amino acids. To determine how rat Angptl4 shares evolutionary conservation with mouse and human Angptl4, we performed reverse transcription PCR on the first-strand cDNA derived from total RNA of rat adipose tissue. The full-length coding sequence of rat Angptl4 was obtained. Sequence comparisons revealed that, similar to human Angptl4, rat Angptl4 also encodes a protein of 405 amino acids. However, it shares only 73% identity with the human protein. On the other hand, even though rat Angptl4 has a 5-amino acid internal deletion compared with mouse Angptl4, their amino acid sequences share 97% identity, with the conserved coiledcoil domain and fibrinogen-like domain being essentially identical between mouse and rat proteins. In all experiments described in this study, rat Angptl4 cDNA was used. The complete nucleotide sequence of rat Angptl4 has been submitted to GenBank under accession number AY393999. The alignment of the amino acid sequences of mouse, rat, and human Angptl4 is shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 1Alignment of the amino acid sequences of mouse, rat, and human Angptl4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Native Angptl4 Is a Variably Sized Oligomer Containing Intermolecular Disulfide Bonds—Angiopoietin 1, the founding member of angiopoietin and angiopoietin-like protein family of secreted proteins, consists of distinct modular domains responsible for receptor binding, dimerization, and superclustering (12.Davis S. Papadopoulos N. Aldrich T.H. Maisonpierre P.C. Huang T. Kovac L. Xu A. Leidich R. Radziejewska E. Rafique A. Goldberg J. Jain V. Bailey K. Karow M. Fandl J. Samuelsson S.J. Ioffe E. Rudge J.S. Daly T.J. Radziejewski C. Yancopoulos G.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To determine whether Angptl4 also forms higher order structure, we over-expressed rat Angptl4 in 293 cells via infection of adenoviruses encoding full-length Angptl4 (Ad-Angptl4(L)-myc). When secreted recombinant Angptl4 was detected by Western blotting, three bands were recognized by the C-terminal tag antibody (Fig. 2A, Total). The three bands consist of an upper band of ∼74 kDa and a doublet of ∼50 kDa. Further analysis demonstrated that the 74-kDa band represents full-length Angptl4 protein, whereas the 50-kDa doublet is the proteolytic product of Angptl4, corresponding to its carboxyl fibrinogen-like domain. The amino acid sequence boundaries of the 50-kDa doublets are not known because the N termini of both bands are blocked when subjected to sequencing analysis. One explanation for the appearance of the doublet band is the additional cleavage of primary proteolysis product, because the doublet is detected by the same carboxyl-terminal antibodies recognizing fibrinogen-like domain or c-myc tag of Angptl4.The same supernatant containing recombinant Angptl4 was loaded onto a Superdex 200 column, and fractions were collected and analyzed by Western blotting to determine the elution profile of Angptl4 protein. Fig. 2A shows that Angptl4 first appears in an early fraction, near the void volume of the column, which excludes globular proteins of 600 kDa and larger. It continues to elute over a broad range to a position that corresponds to a protein of ∼100 kDa. Its broad range of mobility in a gel filtration column suggests that Angptl4, similar to angiopoietin-1 (12.Davis S. Papadopoulos N. Aldrich T.H. Maisonpierre P.C. Huang T. Kovac L. Xu A. Leidich R. Radziejewska E. Rafique A. Goldberg J. Jain V. Bailey K. Karow M. Fandl J. Samuelsson S.J. Ioffe E. Rudge J.S. Daly T.J. Radziejewski C. Yancopoulos G.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), also forms variable-sized multimers. We also performed sucrose density gradient sedimentation experiments, with results similar to those obtained by gel filtration (data not shown)Interestingly, the doublet band of recombinant Angptl4 from total starting supernatant, a proteolytic product of full-length Angptl4, eluted as an apparent monomer from the same Superdex 200 column. This doublet is recognized by both a c-myc monoclonal antibody, which recognizes the c-myc tag fused to the carboxyl terminus of Angptl4, as well as a polyclonal antibody generated in rabbit using the carboxyl fibrinogen-like domain of Angptl4 as antigen (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the monomeric carboxyl fibrinogen-like domain is converted from oligomerized, full-length Angptl4. Consequently, the carboxyl fibrinogen-like domain of Angptl4 loses the ability to form higher order structure.Formation of high molecular weight protein complexes frequently involves disulfide bond formation between protein monomers, such as adiponectin/ACRP30 (16.Scherer P.E.

https://openalex.org/W2053904381,"Cellular stress responses induced during viral infections are critical to the health and survival of organisms. In higher vertebrates, interferons (IFNs) mediate the innate antiviral response in part through the action of RNase L, a uniquely regulated enzyme. RNase L is activated by 5′-phosphorylated, 2′-5′ oligoadenylates (2-5A) produced from IFN-inducible and double stranded RNA-dependent synthetases. We show that viral activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK) family of MAP kinases and viral induction of apoptosis are both deficient in mouse cells lacking RNase L. Also, JNK phosphorylation in response to 2-5A was greatly reduced in RNase L-/- mouse cells. In addition, 2-5A treatment of the human ovarian carcinoma cell line, Hey1b, resulted in specific ribosomal RNA cleavage products coinciding with JNK activation. Furthermore, suppression of JNK activity with the chemical inhibitor, SP600125, prevented apoptosis induced by 2-5A. In contrast, inhibition of alternative MAP kinases, p38 and ERK, failed to prevent 2-5A-mediated apoptosis. Short interfering RNA to JNK1/JNK2 mRNAs resulted in JNK ablation while also suppressing 2-5A-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, Jnk1-/- Jnk2-/- cells were highly resistant to the apoptotic effects of IFN and 2-5A. These findings suggest that JNK and RNase L function in an integrated signaling pathway during the IFN response that leads to elimination of virus-infected cells through apoptosis.

Short interfering RNA to JNK1/JNK2 mRNAs resulted in JNK ablation while also suppressing 2-5A-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, Jnk1-/- Jnk2-/- cells were highly resistant to the apoptotic effects of IFN and 2-5A. These findings suggest that JNK and RNase L function in an integrated signaling pathway during the IFN response that leads to elimination of virus-infected cells through apoptosis.

The three JNK genes (Jnk1, Jnk2, and Jnk3) encode ten different molecular mass species of JNK as a result of alternative splicing, including 55- and 46-kDa isoforms from each gene (5.Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar). Mice with homologous disruptions of the individual Jnk genes are viable, as are Jnk1-/- Jnk3-/- and Jnk2-/- Jnk3-/- double gene knockout mice (6.Kuan C.Y. Yang D.D. Samanta Roy D.R. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). In contrast, combined loss of ubiquitously expressed JNK1 and JNK2 results in embryonic lethality associated with altered neuronal apoptosis and exencephaly (6.Kuan C.Y. Yang D.D. Samanta Roy D.R.

Mech. Dev. 1999; 89: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). JNK3 is present mostly in brain, therefore Jnk1-/- Jnk2-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lack JNK and are an important resource for determining the biologic functions of JNK (6.Kuan C.Y. Yang D.D. Samanta Roy D.R. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 7.Sabapathy K. Jochum W. Hochedlinger K. Chang L. Karin M. Wagner E.F. Mech. Dev. 1999; 89: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). For example, Jnk1-/- Jnk2-/- MEFs are deficient in both activator protein-1 transcriptional activity and stress-induced apoptosis (8.Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 9.Ventura J.J. Kennedy N.J. Lamb J.A. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). JNKs often play a critical role in controlling the balance between cell survival and death. For instance, JNK1 signals cell survival in transformed B lymphocytes mediated in part by increased Bcl2 expression (10.Hess P. Pihan G. Sawyers C.L. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In contrast, sustained activation of JNK in the absence of cell survival signals results in apoptosis (11.Lei K. Nimnual A. Zong W.X. Kennedy N.J. Flavell R.A. Thompson C.B. Bar-Sagi D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4929-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). A major function of JNK is regulation of the activator protein-1 transcription factor through phosphorylation of c-Jun and related proteins (reviewed in Ref. 5.Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar). However, in addition to controlling new transcription JNKs participate in apoptotic signaling by regulating the activities of pre-existing Bcl2-related proteins that mediate mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and subsequent caspase activation (8.Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). For example, proteolytic activation of Bid, a pro-apoptotic BH3-only Bcl2-related protein, occurs in UV-treated wild type cells but not in similarly treated Jnk1-/- Jnk2-/- MEFs. Furthermore, JNK activation failed to induce death of cells deficient in the pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax and Bak (11.Lei K. Nimnual A. Zong W.X. Kennedy N.J. Flavell R.A. Thompson C.B. Bar-Sagi D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4929-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The possible role of JNK in regulating apoptosis through Bcl2 and Bcl-xL phosphorylation is controversial, in part because results vary as to whether apoptosis would be enhanced or suppressed (12.Ito T.

Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). In neurons, the BH3-only Bcl2 member, Bim, and JNK are both implicated in apoptosis caused by nerve growth factor deprivation (15.Putcha G.V. Moulder K.L. Golden J.P. Bouillet P. Adams J.A. Strasser A. Johnson E.M. Neuron. 2001; 29: 615-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 16.Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J.

Although these studies suggest that JNK can control certain Bcl2-related molecules at different levels, the molecular mechanism(s) by which JNK directly or indirectly controls activation of different Bcl2 members remain to be elucidated. Among the types of cellular stress stimuli that activate JNKs are agents that damage cellular RNA, in particular ribosomal RNA (rRNA). For example, ribotoxins (α-sarcin and ricin A chain) and UV that damage the 3′ end of the large (28 S) rRNA activate JNK (17.Iordanov M.S. Magun B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25801-25806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18.Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15794-15803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). JNK is also activated by double stranded RNA (dsRNA) treatment of cells, which results in the cleavage of 28 S rRNA by RNase L (20.Iordanov M.S. Paranjape J.M. Zhou A. Wong J. Williams B.R. Meurs E.F. Silverman R.H. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). dsRNA, often viral in origin, activates the IFN-inducible 2-5A synthetases that convert ATP to PPi and a series of 2′-5′ oligoadenylates (p3A(2′p5′A)n, n = 2 ≥ 4) collectively referred to as 2-5A (see Ref. 21.Kerr I.M. Brown R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 22.Silverman R.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 42: 1805-1812Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The only well established function of 2-5A is activation of RNase L, an endoribonuclease with nine ankyrin repeats and two P-loop motifs in its N-terminal half and protein kinase-like and a ribonuclease domain in the C-terminal half (23.Zhou A. Hassel B.A. Silverman R.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 753-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Binding of 2-5A in the ankyrin-region of RNase L converts the enzyme from inactive monomers to active dimers (24.Dong B. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4133-4137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Sustained activation of RNase L by 2-5A leads to apoptosis, thus limiting the spread of viral infections (25.Castelli J.C. Hassel B.A. Wood K.A. Li X.L. Amemiya K. Dalakas M.C. Torrence P.F.

RNase L-/- mice are viable but have enhanced susceptibility to encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and are deficient in apoptosis in several different cell types, including thymocytes, splenocytes, and fibroblasts (27.Zhou A.

In addition, RNase L-/- mice are deficient in cellular immunity both after skin allografts and during alphaviral-based DNA tumor vaccinations (28.Leitner W.W. Hwang L.N. DeVeer M.J. Zhou A.

The pro-apoptotic activity of RNase L may restrict tumor growth as suggested by the recent mapping of the hereditary prostate cancer 1 (HPC1) susceptibility allele to the RNase L gene (reviewed in Ref. 22.Silverman R.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 42: 1805-1812Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar; see Ref. 30.Carpten J. Nupponen N. Isaacs S. Sood R. Robbins C. Xu J. Faruque M. Moses T. Ewing C. Gillanders E. Hu P.

Zhou A. Silverman R.H. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 1091-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The apoptotic activity of RNase L is suppressed by Bcl2, further implicating the involvement of mitochondria in the cell death pathway initiated by 2-5A (31.Diaz-Guerra M. Rivas C. Esteban M. Virology. 1997; 236: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate involvement of RNase L in JNK activation during viral infections, and furthermore we show that JNK is essential for apoptosis in response to RNase L activation. Reagents and Antibodies—The JNK inhibitor, SP600125, and p38 inhibitor, SB202190, were from Calbiochem, whereas p38 inhibitor, SB203580, and the ERK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, were from Biomol. Human recombinant human IFN-α BDBB, active on both human and mouse cells, was a generous gift from H. K. Hochkepper, H. K. Novartis Pharma AG) (32.Gangemi J.D. Lazdins J. Dietrich F.M. Matter A.

The JNK1/2 siRNA (5′-AAA GAA UGU CCU ACC UUC UTT-3′ and 5′-AGA AGG UAG GAC AUU CUU UTT-3′) target a common sequence in both Jnk1 and Jnk2 mRNA (377 nucleotides downstream from the start codon) and was synthesized by Xeragon Inc. The phospho-SAPK/JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185) antibody and antibodies to total JNK antibody, total PARP, cleaved PARP, total p38, phospho-p38, total ERK, and phospho-ERK were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. The antibody to β-actin was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. or Sigma. Monoclonal antibody to human RNase L was reported by us previously (24.Dong B. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4133-4137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Natural 2-5A (p3(A2′p)nA, where n = 1 to ≥3) was prepared enzymatically from ATP using hexahistidine tagged and purified human recombinant 42-kDa 2-5A synthetase (a gift from R. Hartmann, Cleveland) (33.Rusch L. Dong B. Silverman R.H. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The “natural 2-5A” is a mixture of ppp(A2′p)nA, in the following proportions: n = 1, 42%; n = 2, 41%; n = 3, 10%; n = 4, 2%. Individual 2-5A oligomers were purified using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Phosphorothioate analogs of 2-5A were prepared using an ABI 380B automated DNA synthesizer and were purified by high performance liquid chromatograpy. 2Z. Wang and R. H. Silverman, unpublished data. Cells and Cell Culture—The human ovarian carcinoma cell line, Hey1b (a gift from A. Marks and Y. Xu), was grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. MEFs were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and non-essential amino acids. Immortalized (post-crisis) RNase L-/- MEF cell lines were described previously (27.Zhou A. Paranjape J. Brown T.L. Nie H. Naik S. Dong B. Chang A. Trapp B. Fairchild R. Colmenares C. Silverman R.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6355-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). RNase L-/- MEF cells stably transfected with plasmids pINDRNase L or pINDRNase LΔEN expressing wild type human RNase L or a nuclease domain-truncated (at residue 406) form of human RNase L, respectively (both under control of a ponasterone-inducible promoter) were cultured as described (34.Xiang Y.

Karin M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 11: 116-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (272) Google Scholar) mutant mice on a BL6/129 background were intercrossed to generate Jnk1-/- Jnk2-/- mutant fetuses, as described (7.Sabapathy K. Jochum W. Hochedlinger K. Chang L. Karin M. Wagner E.F. Mech. Dev. 1999; 89: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). MEFs were isolated from E10.0 Jnk1-/- Jnk2-/- embryos and their respective wild type counterparts as described (36.Sabapathy K. Hu Y.L. Kallunki T. Schreiber M. David J.P. Jochum W. Wagner E.F. Karin M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 11: 116-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Briefly, fetal livers were removed, and MEFs were isolated through a 70-μm cell strainer (Falcon). Yolk sacs or heads were used for genotyping. Immortalization of cells was performed by splitting MEFs every third day at a 1:3 ratio until they entered the crisis phase. Medium was changed twice a week for the following 4-6 weeks until single cells became immortal and formed colonies. These colonies were expanded further for use in experiments. Transfections—Transfections with 2-5A, siRNA, or plasmids were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). In experiments requiring extended incubations, 3.5 h after transfection an equal volume of medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum was added. In experiments involving in IFN, the cells were pretreated with IFN (1,000 units per ml) for 16 h and then transfected with 2-5A. In experiments involving MAP kinase inhibitors, cells were preincubated with inhibitor for 1 h prior to 2-5A transfections. Viral Infections—Cells were grown overnight, and medium was removed and replaced with serum-free medium containing EMCV (American Type Culture Collection) at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1 to 2 for 0.5 h at which time cells were washed, and medium with 10% fetal bovine serum was added. Induction of RNase L expression from inducible vectors was performed by pre-incubating cells with 5 μm ponasterone for 16 h prior to EMCV infections. Measuring Protein Synthesis in Intact Cells—Rates of cellular protein synthesis were determined as described previously (33.Rusch L. Dong B. Silverman R.H. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with ps5′A(2′ps)3A for 3 h at 37 °C. After removing medium and washing cells with phosphate-buffered saline, RPMI 1640 medium lacking methionine (Specialty Media, Phillipsburg, NJ) and supplemented with 0.3 μCi per ml of [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) was added, and cells were incubated a further 2 h. Medium was removed, and protein was precipitated with 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid as described (33.Rusch L. Dong B. Silverman R.H. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Precipitated protein was solubilized with 0.25 m NaOH and neutralized, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. RNase L Activity in Intact Cells—Hey1b cells were transfected with 5 μm 2-5A using LipofectAMINE 2000. At the indicated times, the total RNA was isolated from transfected cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and quantitated by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. RNA (2 μg) was separated on RNA chips and analyzed with Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies). The peak areas of 28 S and 18 S rRNA and their main cleavage products were determined by using the Bio Sizing (version A.10.30 S1220) program (Agilent Biotechnologies). RNase L Activity in a Cell-free System—RNase L activity was determined by the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) method. 3C. Thakur, Z. Xu, and R. H. Silverman, unpublished data. The assay uses recombinant human RNase L produced in insect cells from a baculovirus vector and purified to homogeneity with three successive fast protein liquid chromatography columns (24.Dong B. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4133-4137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The cleavable substrate consists of a 36-nucleotide synthetic oligoribonucleotide sequence derived from respiratory syncytial virus with the fluorophore, FAM, at the 5′ terminus and black hole quencher-1 (BHQ-1), at the 3′ terminus (synthesized at Integrated DNA Technologies). The RNA sequence contains several cleavage sites for RNase L (UU or UA). The reaction buffer contains 100 nm RNA probe, 25 nm RNase L, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, and 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol with and without 50 nm psA(2′ps5′A)3 and SP600125 (25 μm). RNase L was the last component added to the reaction mixtures, which were incubated for 30 min at 20 °C. Fluorescence was measured with a Wallac 1420 fluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (absorption 485 nm/emission 535 nm). 2-5A Binding Assay for RNase L—A 32P-labeled and bromine-substituted 2-5A analog, p(A2′p)2(br8A2′p)2A3′[32P]pCp, was cross-linked to RNase L present in cytoplasmic extracts of cells under ultraviolet light (37.Nolan-Sorden N.L. Lesiak K. Bayard B. Torrence P.F. Silverman R.H. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cell extracts (200 μg protein) were incubated with the probe (0.02 μCi; 750 Ci/mmol) on ice for 60 min and then under 308 nm of light on ice for 60 min. Protein separation was by electrophoresis on SDS/8% polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography of the dried gels. Quantitation was by phosphorimage analysis. Cell Viability Assay—The viability of Hey1b cells were determined by using the colorimetric Cell titer 96® AQueous Cell Proliferation (tetrazolium conversion) assay (Promega). Hey1b cells were seeded (1.5 × 104 cells per well) into 96-well plates. At various times of treatment with 2-5A and/or SP600125, 50 μl of Cell titer 96® AQueous reagents were added to each well, incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and absorbance was measured at 490 nm with a 96-well plate reader (model Spectra max 340; Molecular Devices). Western Blots—Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g (at 4 °C for 10 min). Protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined (Bio-Rad protein assay kit). Protein (30 μg per lane) was separated in 8 to 12% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were incubated with different primary antibodies according to the manufacturer's protocols. TUNEL Assay—Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) dUTP nick end labeling analysis (TUNEL) for DNA fragmentation was carried out using an apo-Brdu kit (BD Biosciences). Briefly, after the indicated treatments, media containing floating cells were collected. Adherent cells were trypsinized and combined with medium containing floating cells. Cell were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and stored in 70% ethanol at -20 °C until staining and analysis. DNA breakage was determined by incorporating 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine and staining with a labeled anti-bromodeoxyuridine monoclonal antibody. The total DNA content was determined with propidium iodide, and analysis was performed by flow cytometry in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). JNK Kinase Assay—JNK kinase activity was determined using the SAPK/JNK Assay Kit (nonradioactive) (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). Briefly, cells were treated as described and lysed in cell lysis buffer (provided by the manufacturer). Supernatants of 12,000 × g/10-min centrifugations were incubated with an N-terminal c-Jun fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads to pull down SAPK/JNK. The beads were washed twice to remove nonspecific bound proteins. The kinase reaction was in the presence of ATP in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm MgCl2. JNK-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun was measured by quantitative immunoblotting with phospho-c-Jun (Ser-63) antibody. Viral Activation of JNK and Apoptosis Are Deficient in Cells Lacking RNase L—To determine the impact of RNase L on viral-induced apoptosis, RNase L+/+ or RNase L-/- MEFs were infected with EMCV at an m.o.i. of 2 and were then monitored for DNA breakage by FACS TUNEL assays at 8 h post-infection. Results show about 34% of wild type cells became TUNEL-positive after infection, in contrast to only 8% of cells lacking RNase L (Fig. 1B). In addition, in RNase L-/- cells induced to express full-length human RNase L (from plasmid pINDRNase L), the level of virus-induced apoptosis increased to about 20% whereas induced expression of a truncated form of RNase L lacking the endoribonuclease domain (from plasmid pINDRNase LΔEN) produced only about 11% TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 1, A and B). These findings show that RNase L contributes to EMCV-induced apoptosis in MEFs cells. EMCV infections (m.o.i. = 1) of wild type and the reconstituted (pINDRNase L) MEFs also caused robust phosphorylation of JNK (46- and 54-kDa isoforms) by 6 h post-infection correlating with cleavage of the death substrate PARP (Fig. 1C). In contrast, at the same time post-infection in the RNase L-/- MEFs there was relatively weak JNK phosphorylation (about 4-fold lower than in the RNase L+/+ and pINDRNase L cells as determined by densitometry) and little or no PARP cleavage. A more modest deficiency in virus-induction of JNK phosphorylation was observed in cells expressing the nuclease-deleted polypeptide, RNase LΔEN, and although a low level of PARP cleavage was present even in the absence of virus there was no increase until a late time (8 h), post-infection. Previously we showed using the same cell lines that the RNase L-/- cells contained the same levels of JNK as wild type MEFs (20.Iordanov M.S. Paranjape J.M. Zhou A. Wong J. Williams B.R. Meurs E.F. Silverman R.H. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results demonstrate that RNase L contributes to JNK phosphorylation correlating with cell death during EMCV infections. 2-5A Activation of RNase L Results in Stimulation of JNK and Apoptosis—To determine the specific contribution of RNase L to JNK activation and apoptosis, we transfected cells with 2-5A. Transfection of tetrameric 2-5A, p3(A2′p)3A (10 μm for 4 h), caused JNK phosphorylation in RNase L+/+ cells but not RNase L-/- cells (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 2 and 4). Similar findings were seen in ponasterone-induced pINDRNase L cells expressing full-length wild type RNase L but not in the uninduced cells (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 6 and 8) (34.Xiang Y. Condit R.C. Vijaysri S. Jacobs B. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5251-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The ribonuclease domain was necessary for 2-5A induction of JNK as there was no JNK phosphorylation in ponasterone-treated RNase L-/- cells containing pINDRNase LΔEN (Fig. 2A, lane 12). To extend these findings to human cells, studies were performed on the ovarian carcinoma cell line, Hey1b, treated with biostable phosphorothioate 2-5A analogs. 4Z. Wang and R. H. Silverman, unpublished data. A control compound, the diadenylate psA2′sp5′A, which is unable to activate RNase L, failed to induce PARP cleavage or to cause significant JNK phosphorylation (Fig. 2B, lanes 2-6). In contrast, transfection with the active 2-5A analog, ps(A2′ps5′)3A, resulted in phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2, B and C). Activation of JNK peaked by 3.5 h after 2-5A transfection, preceding the cleavage of PARP by several hours (Fig. 2B, lanes 7-11). MAP kinase p38, on the other hand, was not phosphorylated in the Hey1b cells treated with 2-5A. In contrast exposing cells to UV light did activate p38 in these cells (Fig. 2D, lane 14). The tetramer, ps(A2′ps5′)3A, caused a dose-dependent (up to 8 μm) inhibition of protein synthesis, <30% of the control, whereas the same conc"

The FSHβ subunit is primarily regulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), gonadal steroids, and activin. Here, we identify elements in the mouse FSHβ promoter responsible for GnRH-mediated induction utilizing the LβT2 cell line that endogenously expresses FSH. The proximal 398 bp of the mouse FSHβ promoter is sufficient for response to GnRH. This response localizes primarily to an AP-1 half-site (–72/–69) juxtaposed to a CCAAT box, which binds nuclear factor-Y. Both elements are required for AP-1 binding, creating a novel AP-1 site. Multimers of this site confer GnRH induction, and mutation or internal deletion of this site reduces GnRH induction by 35%. The same reduction was achieved using a dominant negative Fos protein. This is the only functional AP-1 site identified in the proximal 398 bp, since its mutation eliminates FSHβ induction by c-Fos and c-Jun. GnRH regulation of the FSHβ gene occurs through induction of multiple Fos and Jun isoforms, forming at least four different AP-1 molecules, all of which bind to this site. Mitogen-activated protein kinase activity is required for induction of FSHβ and JunB protein. Finally, AP-1 interacts with nuclear factor-Y, which occupies its overlapping site in vivo.

Wang Y. Lu N. Matzuk M.M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Production of FSH is limited to anterior pituitary gonadotrope cells, which also produce luteinizing hormone (LH). FSH is a heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone consisting of two subunits: an α-subunit, which is common to LH, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and chorionic gonadotropin (CG), and a unique β-subunit that confers specific biological activity (2.Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). Expression of the β-subunit gene is the limiting factor in FSH synthesis, and its transcription is regulated primarily by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), gonadal steroids, and the activin-inhibin-follistatin system (3.Kaiser U.B. Conn P.M. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 46-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 4.Vale W. Rivier C. Brown M. Annu. Rev.

GnRH is a decapeptide neurohormone, released by a subset of hypothalamic neurons into the hypophyseal portal system, where it binds its receptor on the pituitary gonadotrope membrane. The GnRH receptor belongs to the class of G protein-coupled receptors and, upon ligand binding, activates the protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways (6.Liu F. Austin D.A. DiPaolo D. Mellon P.L. Olefsky J.M. Webster N.J.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 419-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). GnRH administration, either to cells in culture or to hypogonadotropic animals, induces transcription of the early response genes, c-fos, c-jun, and egr-1 (7.Cesnjaj M. Catt K.J. Stojilkovic S.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 692-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 8.Padmanabhan V. Dalkin A. Yasin M. Haisenleder D.J. Marshall J.C. Landefeld T.D. Biol.

The transcription factor AP-1, which is composed of Jun/Jun homodimers or Jun/Fos heterodimers, has been implicated in GnRH induction of the FSHβ gene. Previous studies reported that nuclear proteins from GnRH-treated cells bind an AP-1 consensus sequence (10.Strahl B.D. Huang H.J. Sebastian J. Ghosh B.R. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4455-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), that purified c-Jun protein binds putative AP-1 sites in the ovine FSHβ promoter (11.Strahl B.D. Huang H.J. Pedersen N.R. Wu J.C. Ghosh B.R. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2621-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and that mutation of putative AP-1 sites in this promoter reduces GnRH induction in heterologous HeLa cells (10.Strahl B.D. Huang H.J. Sebastian J. Ghosh B.R. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4455-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, in mice carrying a transgene of the ovine FSHβ 5′-flanking region linked to luciferase in which the same AP-1 sites were mutated, transgene response to GnRH did not differ from the wild-type ovine FSHβ promoter (12.Huang H.J. Sebastian J. Strahl B.D. Wu J.C. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2260-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, one of these AP-1 sites is not conserved in the mouse, rat, or human promoters. Therefore, there is a need to examine FSHβ regulation of the mouse gene, especially in light of the fact that there is a high degree of conservation between mouse and human FSHβ genes and that targeted disruption of the FSHβ gene in mice has a phenotype similar to loss-of-function mutations in humans (1.Kumar T.R. Wang Y. Lu N. Matzuk M.M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Until recently, no FSHβ-producing cell lines were available. Models of GnRH action using reconstitution of GnRH receptor in non-gonadotrope-derived cell lines may lack signaling molecules or transcription factors necessary for appropriate induction of gonadotrope-specific genes, whereas primary pituitary cell cultures contain only about 5% gonadotropes and are difficult to manipulate in vitro. The gonadotrope-derived LβT2 cell line expresses FSHβ endogenously (13.Pernasetti F. Vasilyev V.V. Rosenberg S.B. Bailey J.S. Huang H.-J. Miller W.L. Mellon P.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2284-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and secretes FSH in response to activin (14.Graham K.E. Nusser K.D. Low M.J. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 162: R1-R5Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These cells also express other markers of pituitary gonadotropes, most notably α-subunit, GnRH receptor, LHβ, and all of the components of the activin system autocrine loop: activin, follistatin, and activin receptor (13.Pernasetti F. Vasilyev V.V. Rosenberg S.B. Bailey J.S. Huang H.-J. Miller W.L. Mellon P.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2284-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) as well as inhibin and inhibin receptor (15.Lewis K.A. Gray P.C. Blount A.L. MacConell L.A. Wiater E. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W. Nature. 2000; 404: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Therefore, the LβT2 cell line is an excellent model in which to directly study regulation of FSHβ gene expression. Indeed, these cells have been used to investigate GnRH signal transduction (16.Vasilyev V.V. Pernasetti F. Rosenberg S.B. Barsoum M.J. Austin D.A. Webster N.J.G. Mellon P.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1651-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and, more recently, the molecular basis for cell-specific expression of FSHβ, by comparison with the non-FSH-producing gonadotrope-derived cell line, αT3–1 (17.Jacobs S.B.R. Coss D. McGillivray S.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1470-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the latter study, we identified specific promoter elements binding steroidogenic factor-1, an orphan nuclear receptor that is specifically expressed in the gonadotrope population and regulates gonadotrope-specific genes within the pituitary. We also identified a conserved binding site in the proximal region of the promoter for nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y), a ubiquitously expressed heterotrimeric transcription factor (18.Mantovani R. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 239: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar), and showed a role for both NF-Y and steroidogenic factor-1 in gonadotrope-specific expression of the mouse FSHβ gene (17.Jacobs S.B.R. Coss D. McGillivray S.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1470-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study is to gain an understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which GnRH induces FSHβ gene expression, using the mouse LβT2 gonadotrope cell model. We demonstrate that regulation by GnRH is mediated in part by induction of multiple AP-1 isoforms. These AP-1 isoforms bind a novel site that overlaps the element that binds the basal transcription factor NF-Y. This novel site consists of a half-site of the AP-1 consensus binding sequence and an adjacent CCAAT box. Furthermore, NF-Y and AP-1 physically interact and, following GnRH stimulation, co-occupy this site in vivo. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—LβT2 cells were plated on 6-well plates 1 day prior to transfection. Transfection was performed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum using Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. Each well was transfected with 1 μg of mFSHβ-luc. Plasmid construction and preparation has been described previously (17.Jacobs S.B.R. Coss D. McGillivray S.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1470-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The 398-bp mouse FSHβ promoter was PCR-amplified from a genomic clone that was kindly provided by Dr. Malcolm Low and ligated into the SmaI restriction site of the pGL3 luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate –398 mFSHβ-luc. The –304 and –230 truncations were created by digesting the MluI/BglII fragment of –398 mFSHβ-luc with XmnI and BbvI restriction enzymes, respectively. The truncated promoter fragments were then blunt-ended with Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and ligated into the SmaI restriction site of pGL3. The –129 reporter was created by digesting the MluI/BglII fragment of –304 mFSHβ-luc with DpnI, bluntended with Klenow, and ligated into the SmaI restriction site of pGL3. The –194 plasmid was generated by digesting the MluI/BglII fragment of –230 mFSHβ-luc with the RsaI restriction enzyme and cloning the appropriate promoter fragment into the SmaI and BglII sites of pGL3. The –95 FSHβLuc plasmid was created by PCR-amplifying the promoter from –398 mFSHβ-luc using a forward primer corresponding to the sequence of the mouse FSHβ promoter from –95 to –77 bp and containing a KpnI linker and a reverse primer spanning the HindIII restriction site from the pGL3 vector. The PCR product was digested with KpnI and BglII restriction enzymes and ligated into the corresponding sites in pGL3. The reporter plasmid with the multimerized novel AP-1 site was created using an oligonucleotide, containing four copies of the –78/–67 sequence of the mouse FSHβ promoter between KpnI and NheI linkers and was ligated into corresponding sites in pGL3, upstream of the –81 bp herpes thymidine kinase promoter, which was ligated between the XhoI and BglII sites. The sequences of all promoter fragments were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing performed by the DNA Sequencing Shared Resource, University of California San Diego Cancer Center. An expression plasmid containing β-galactosidase driven by the Herpesvirus thymidine kinase promoter was co-transfected with mFSHβ-luc and used as an internal control. Sixteen h after transfection, the cells were switched to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 mg/liter transferrin, and 50 nm sodium selenite. The following day, cells were treated with 10 nm GnRH (Sigma) for 6 h, unless otherwise indicated. The cells were then lysed with 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) with 0.2% Triton X-100. Equal volumes of each lysate were placed in 96-well plates, and luciferase activity was measured on a luminometer (EG&G Berthold Microplate) by injecting 100 μl of a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 15 mm MgSO4, 10 mm ATP, and 65 μm luciferin per well. Galactosidase activity was measured using the Galacto-light assay (Tropix, Bedford, MA) following the manufacturer's instructions. All transfection experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Luciferase values from reporter gene-transfected cells were consistently at least 100 times higher than values from mock-transfected cells. Results represent the mean ± S.E. of all samples analyzed. An asterisk marks a statistically significant difference from the control-treated cells, determined by analysis of variance followed by Tukey-Kramer HSD post hoc multiple range test for individual comparison with p ≤ 0.05. Western Blot—Following overnight starvation and GnRH treatment, LβT2 cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, with protease inhibitors: aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin at 10 μg/ml each and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentration was determined with Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad), and an equal amount of protein per sample was loaded on SDS-PAGE gel. After proteins had been resolved by electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, they were probed with specific antibodies for Fos and Jun proteins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and NF-YA (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). The bands were detected with secondary antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—After GnRH treatment, cells were scraped in hypotonic buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2 with the same protease inhibitors as mentioned above for the lysis buffer) and allowed to swell on ice. Cells were lysed by passing through a 25-gauge needle, and the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation. Nuclear proteins were extracted in hypertonic buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 420 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2 with protease inhibitors, and 20% glycerol). Two μg of nuclear proteins per sample was used in the binding reaction (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 with 0.5 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) and 2 fmol per reaction of end-labeled probe). Oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 kinase. In the competition experiments, competitor oligonucleotide was added 10 min prior to the addition of the probe, as were the antibodies in the supershift assays. The Fos, Jun, and NF-Y antibodies used are the same as in the Western blot, whereas the nonspecific IgG is from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The reaction was loaded on a 5% acrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE and electrophoresed at 1-V/cm2 constant voltage. After drying, gels were exposed to autoradiography. Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis and deletion of the FSHβ-luc plasmid were performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The oligonucleotide used to mutate the AP-1 half-site (GTCA) was 5′-CAGCAGGCTTTATGTTGGTATTGGTCCCGTTAACACCC-3′ (top strand; mutated nucleotides are underlined), and the oligonucleotide used to mutate the NF-Y site (ATTGG) was 5′-CAGCAGGCTTTATGTTGGTACCGGTCATGTTAACACCC-3′ (top strand; again, underlined nucleotides indicate a change from the wild-type sequence). To create an AP-1 consensus, the NF-Y site/AP-1 half-site was mutated to a consensus AP-1 site using the oligonucleotide 5′-CAGCAGGCTTTATGTTGGTATGAGTCATGTTAACACCC-3′. To create a reporter lacking the AP-1 site, a specific internal deletion was made using the oligonucleotide 5′-CAGCAGGCTTTATGTTGGTGTTAACACCCAGTAAATCC-3′. Mutations were confirmed by dideoxyribonucleotide sequencing, as above. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—LβT2 cells were starved overnight and treated with GnRH for 2 h. Proteins were cross-linked to DNA by the addition of 1% formaldehyde directly to the cell medium, and, after obtaining the nuclear fraction, chromatin was sonicated to an average length of 1 kb in sonication buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). After preclearing with protein A beads, protein-DNA complexes were bound overnight to the same c-Jun, c-Fos, and NF-Y antibodies as were used in the EMSA experiments for supershift assays and precipitated with protein A beads (Amersham Biosciences). After extensive washing (two times each with sonication buffer defined above, high salt sonication buffer (500 mm NaCl with other components as defined above), lithium chloride buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 250 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate), and TE buffer), cross-linking was reversed by the addition of 300 mm NaCl and incubation at 65 °C, and proteins were digested by incubation with Proteinase K. DNA was phenol-chloroform-extracted and ethanol-precipitated, and the sequence of interest was amplified by PCR. Primers used in PCR were 5′-GGTGTGCTGCCATATCAGATTCGG-3′ and 5′-GCATCAAGTGCTGCTACTCACCTGTG-3′ and spanned the 280-bp sequence in the mouse FSHβ gene from –223 to +57. The specificity of the product was assessed by the presence of a single band of the expected size on an ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. For quantification, the PCR product was labeled by including [α-32P]dATP in the nucleotide mix used in PCR and run on a 5% acrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE. The gels were dried, subjected to autoradiography, and quantified using a PhosphorImager Optical Scanner Storm 860 (Amersham Biosciences) and the ImageQuant program (Amersham Biosciences).

The NF-Y and green florescent protein expression vectors were provided by Dr. Roberto Mantovani (24.Liberati C. Ronchi A. Lievens P. Ottolenghi S. Mantovani R. J. Biol.

Bacteria transformed with the pGEX vectors were grown to an OD of 0.6, upon which protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.25 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactosidase. Bacterial pellets were sonicated in phosphate-buffered saline with 5 mm EDTA and 0.1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged, and the supernatant was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were washed four times with sonication buffer, followed by equilibration in the binding buffer (below), and split equally between different samples and the control. 35S-Labeled proteins were added to the beads and bound for 1 h at 4 °C in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.8), with 50 mm NaCl, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. After extensive washing, samples were eluted from the beads by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Afterward, the gels were dried and autoradiographed. GnRH Induces FSHβ through Proximal Regulatory Sequences— Since GnRH is a major regulator of FSHβ synthesis, we sought to determine the molecular mechanisms by which GnRH induces FSHβ gene expression. A plasmid containing the proximal 398 bp of the mouse FSHβ 5′ regulatory region linked to a luciferase reporter gene (mFSHβ-luc) was transiently transfected into LβT2 cells. We chose to study the mouse FSHβ regulatory sequence transfected into this FSH-expressing, murine pituitary gonadotrope cell line to provide a homologous model for analysis of gene expression. This region of the mouse gene is highly conserved with ovine, rat, and human FSHβ genes. We have previously shown that 398 bp of the 5′ regulatory region of the mouse FSHβ gene is sufficient to provide gonadotrope-specific expression (17.Jacobs S.B.R. Coss D. McGillivray S.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1470-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). LβT2 cells transiently transfected with mFSHβ-luc were treated with increasing concentrations of GnRH to test whether this region of the mouse FSHβ gene is also sufficient for GnRH responsiveness. Stimulation with GnRH over a range of doses and time periods revealed that this short regulatory region contains elements that allow response to GnRH in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Maximal induction is observed after 6 h of GnRH treatment, and expression returns to basal level within 24 h of GnRH treatment (Fig. 1A). Increasing doses of GnRH result in increasing activity of the mouse FSHβ promoter. In the following experiments, cells were treated for 6 h with 10 nm GnRH, a concentration closer to the physiological range of GnRH during the estrous cycle. To identify which promoter elements convey GnRH responsiveness, we mapped regions of the mouse FSHβ gene promoter that confer GnRH response using truncation deletion analysis. LβT2 cells were transiently transfected with a series of truncations of the mouse FSHβ gene 5′-flanking region, ranging in length from 398 to 95 bp upstream of the transcription start site, and the ability of GnRH to induce transcription was assayed (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1B displays the GnRH regulation as -fold induction over vehicle-treated for each of the truncated promoter regions. As we have previously shown, the basal level of expression is not significantly changed by truncation through the region from –398 to –95 in LβT2 cells (17.Jacobs S.B.R. Coss D. McGillivray S.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1470-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, here we show that GnRH induction is significantly reduced by sequential deletion of either of two regions of the mouse FSHβ promoter. Significant decreases in GnRH responsiveness were found when the promoter was truncated from –304 to –230 bp and in the most proximal region between –95 bp and the start site of transcription. The reduction due to truncation from –304 to –230 is minor, and an apparent increase in responsiveness from –127 to –95 is not statistically significant, but it leads to the finding that no statistically significant decrease in responsiveness exists between truncations –304 and –95. Indeed, a substantial level of induction is retained in the 95-bp most proximal region, and this is the focus of the following investigation. An AP-1 Half-site Overlapping the CCAAT Box Is Bound by AP-1 following GnRH Stimulation and Is Essential for Maximal Induction of FSHβ by GnRH—Because the proximal 95-bp region retains 2.6-fold induction by GnRH, whereas the entire 398 bp of the regulatory region is induced 3.4-fold, we focused on this proximal region to determine what transcription factors confer GnRH induction. Using the TransFac® data base (25.Wingender E. Chen X. Hehl R. Karas H. Liebich I. Matys V. Meinhardt T. Pruss M. Reuter I. Schacherer F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar), the proximal region of the promoter was analyzed for putative transcription factor binding sites. This search revealed a half-site for the AP-1 transcription factor adjacent to the CCAAT box, a binding site for the basal transcription factor NF-Y (17.Jacobs S.B.R. Coss D. McGillivray S.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1470-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The AP-1 consensus sequence is TGA(C/G)TCA. In the mouse FSHβ gene promoter, the first half of the AP-1 inverted repeat is replaced by a CCAAT box (ATTGG on the coding strand), and the second half of the repeat (GTCA) is juxtaposed to this CCAAT element. Sequence alignment revealed that the AP-1 half-site and the adjacent NF-Y site are conserved in the mouse, rat, and human FSHβ promoters but absent from the ovine and bovine promoters (Fig. 2A). Next, EMSA was utilized to determine whether NF-Y and/or AP-1 bind to the identified elements and, if so, whether binding is affected by GnRH treatment. For that purpose, a radiolabeled 35-bp sequence from –99 to –65 bp, which spans these sites in the mouse gene, was incubated with nuclear extracts from LβT2 cells treated with GnRH for different lengths of time (Fig. 2B). Several bands were detected that show altered intensity following GnRH treatment. These include complex 1, which shows increased intensity, and complex 2, which is only present following GnRH treatment. To examine whether these complexes contain AP-1 or NF-Y, we used antibodies that recognize all of the Fos and Jun protein isoforms, respectively, and an antibody directed against the NF-YA subunit, which is the most regulated subunit of the NF-Y heterotrimer (18.Mantovani R. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 239: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). The Fos antibody induces a complete supershift of the faster mobility complex 2 and a partial supershift of the slower mobility complex 1, reducing the intensity of complex 1 to the untreated (0 GnRH) control level, as does the Jun antibody. These results indicate that both GnRH-regulated bands contain AP-1 complexes, which consist of Fos/Jun heterodimers. The NF-Y antibody completely supershifts complex 1 in the control extracts, as well as some of complex 1 in GnRH-treated nuclear extracts. We postulated that complex 1 is composed of an AP-1 complex co-migrating with an NF-Y complex and that complex 2 is another form of AP-1. Attempts to resolve the bands within complex 1 were unsuccessful. However, the simultaneous inclusion of both NF-Y and AP-1 antibodies supershifts complex 1 completely, indicating that this band is composed of two complexes, one induced by GnRH (Fos/Jun) and one not affected by GnRH (NF-Y). Thus, AP-1 in nuclear extracts from cells treated for either 2 or 6 h with GnRH, but not from untreated cells, bind to this proximal region of the mouse FSHβ promoter. NF-Y, on the other hand, binds to its site in both control and GnRH-treated cells, and the intensity of NF-Y binding does not change in response to GnRH. To determine which nucleotides are needed for NF-Y and AP-1 binding, competitions with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled mutant oligonucleotides were utilized (Fig. 3). Two base-pair scanning mutations (mutants A–J) and a one base-pair mutation (mutant K), were introduced into the –99/–65 oligonucleotide (Fig. 3A). Nuclear extract from vehicle-treated LβT2 cells was used in EMSA to confirm that NF-Y binds the CCAAT box (Fig. 3B). Oligonucleotides with mutations in the NF-Y element (mutants E, F, G, and to some extent H) cannot bind NF-Y and do not compete with the labeled wild-type probe. The AP-1 consensus sequence (AP-1 lane) cannot compete for NF-Y binding (Fig. 3B). In a similar competition EMSA, using nuclear proteins from cells treated with GnRH for 6 h (Fig. 3C), mutants E–I cannot compete successfully for AP-1 binding. Inclusion of an NF-Y antibody to induce a supershift of NF-Y allows visualization of the AP-1 band, which is normally obscured by their co-migration (Fig. 3D). Again, binding of NF-Y, which is supershifted (ssNF-Y), requires bases mutated in E, F, G, and partially H, whereas binding of AP-1 requir"

Here, we report that in addition to regulating membrane expression, CAL also regulates the expression of mature CFTR. The co-expression of hemagglutinin-tagged or Myc-tagged CAL with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-CFTR in COS-7 cells causes a dose-dependent reduction in mature GFP-CFTR, independent of its tags. Bafilomycin A1, a lysosomal proton pump inhibitor, increases mature GFP-CFTR, confirming previous reports of lysosomal degradation of mature CFTR. Importantly, bafilomycin A1 reverses CAL-mediated CFTR degradation. The proteasome inhibitor, MG132, on the other hand, does not reverse the effect of CAL. CAL has no effect on CFTR maturation, suggesting that it exerts its effects on mature CFTR. Co-expression of CAL enhances the degradation of CFTR. We showed previously that CAL reduces the half-life of CFTR at the cell surface. Here we show that expression of dominant-negative dynamin 2 K44A, a large GTPase inhibitor that is known to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and vesicle formation in the Golgi, increases cell surface CFTR as measured by surface biotinylation. More importantly, dynamin 2 K44A also restores cell surface CFTR in CAL-overexpressing cells and partially blocks the CAL-mediated degradation of mature CFTR.

The best-known and probably the primary defect in cystic fibrosis is salt and water transport in plasma membranes of epithelial cells lining the organs of lung, pancreas, liver, intestines, sweat duct, and reproductive systems (3.Rosenstein B.J. Ped. Pulm. 2002; 33: 83-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). CFTR is a membrane protein that belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transport family. It functions as a cAMP-dependent protein kinase- and ATP-regulated Cl– channel (4.Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar), as well as a regulatory protein for the epithelial sodium channel (5.Stutts M.J. Canessa C.M. Olsen J.C. Hamrick M. Cohn J.A. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) and other channels (6.Schwiebert E.M. Benos D.J. Egan M.E. Stutts M.J. Guggino W.B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S145-S166Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), and as a putative receptor for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.Pier G.B. Grout M. Zaidi T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12088-12093Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). These well characterized functions of CFTR require its correct synthesis, maturation, and trafficking from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi to the cell surface.Misfolded proteins are recognized by ER quality control system and are targeted for degradation in ER-associated degradation (8.Kopito R.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S167-S173Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Immature, wild type CFTR is folded inefficiently in the ER with a large fraction degraded before reaching the plasma membrane (9.Benharouga M. Sharma M. Lukacs G.L. Methods Mol. Med. 2002; 70: 229-243PubMed Google Scholar). That which is folded efficiently traffics to the Golgi and acquires complex glycosylation characteristic of the mature CFTR. The most common mutation in CF, ΔF508CFTR, is a misfolded protein and is recognized as such by the ER, translocated to the cytosol, and degraded by the 26 S proteasome (9.Benharouga M. Sharma M. Lukacs G.L. Methods Mol. Med. 2002; 70: 229-243PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the predominant majority of the ΔF508 never matures and traffics to the plasma membrane.The degradation of mature CFTR is less well understood. Recently, Benharouga et al. (10.Benharouga M. Haardt M. Kartner N. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) found that both the lysosome and proteasome are involved. They found that lysosomal inhibitors increase the half-life of mature wild type CFTR in baby hamster kidney cells transfected with CFTR and in the endogenous CFTR in Caco-2 and T84 cells. Interestingly, C-terminal truncation mutants do not traffic to the lysosome. Instead, they are degraded in the proteasome (10.Benharouga M. Haardt M. Kartner N. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, CFTR appears to enter different degradative pathways depending on signals within its C terminus.CFTR possesses a type I, C-terminal, PDZ (PSD-95/DLG/ZO-1)-binding motif. Several PDZ domain proteins known to interact with CFTR include NHE-RF/EBP-50, CAP70, and CAL (CFTR-associated ligand) (11.Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R.

Adding recombinant NHE-RF or CAP70 fusion proteins to the cytoplasmic side of CFTR in vitro increases the activity of CFTR (15.Wang S. Yue H. Derin R.B. Guggino W.B. Li M.

Commun. 2001; 280: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) is a CFTR-interacting PDZ domain protein that associates predominantly with the Golgi apparatus. Overexpression of CAL reduces CFTR chloride currents in mammalian cells by decreasing the expression of CFTR in the plasma membrane (11.Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R. Li M. Stanton B.A. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3520-3529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This effect of CAL can be overcome by NHE-RF, which restores the plasma membrane expression of CFTR. CAL favors the retention of CFTR within the cell, whereas NHE-RF favors surface expression by competing with CAL for the binding of CFTR (11.Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M.

Interestingly, overexpression of CAL also reduces the amount of CFTR (23.Gentzsch M. Cui L. Mengos A. Chang X.B. Chen J.H. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These findings point to a role for CAL in the intracellular trafficking of CFTR. Consistent with this notion, CAL interacts with proteins involved in membrane vesicle trafficking such as the SNARE protein, syntaxin 6, and the small GTPase, TC10 (20.Charest A. Lane K. McMahon K. Housman D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29456-29465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22.Neudauer C.L. Joberty G. Macara I.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CAL also interacts with and potentially regulates the intracellular trafficking of the Wnt receptors, frizzled 5 and 8, neural members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, CALEB/NGC (21.Yao R. Maeda T. Takada S. Noda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24.Hassel B. Schreff M. Stuebe E.M. Blaich U. Schumacher S. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Recently, PDZ domain interactions were found to be involved in trafficking of other plasma membrane proteins both to and from the plasma membrane. For example, synapse-associated protein 102 is involved in the delivery of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors to the cell surface (25.Sans N. Prybylowski K. Petralia R.S. Chang K. Wang Y.X. Racca C. Vicini S. Wenthold R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 6: 520-530Crossref Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In addition, NHE-RF regulates β2-adrenergic receptor recycling to plasma membrane (26.Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar).In addition to the PDZ domain, the C-tail of CFTR contains motifs for endocytosis. A tyrosine motif at the C terminus of CFTR binds directly with the μ light chain of the AP2 complex involved in sorting CFTR for endocytosis into clathrin-coated pits (27.Weixel K.M. Bradbury N.A. Pfleugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 443: S70-S74Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Surface CFTR is endocytosed rapidly. For example, within 5 min, 50% CFTR at the plasma membrane is endocytosed via AP2 clathrin-coated pits. CFTR contained within endosomes can be either recycled back to the plasma membrane or degraded in the lysosome. Because surface CFTR has a long half-life (24–48h), the majority of CFTR must be recycled back to the cell surface instead of targeted to the lysosome for degradation. It is not clear how this process is regulated. In this study, we examined the role of CAL on the expression of mature CFTR protein. We found that CAL regulates the expression of mature CFTR through mechanisms that are both bafilomycin A1- and dynamin 2-sensitive.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection—African green monkey kidney cells (COS-7) (obtained from American Type Tissue Culture) were maintained in DMEM, 20 mm l-glutamine, 100 unit/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Media and other components were purchased from (Invitrogen). The COS-7 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Immunoblotting—The cells were harvested and processed as described previously (11.Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R. Li M. Stanton B.A. Guggino W.B. J. Biol.

Briefly, the cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, and complete protease inhibitor; Roche Applied Sciences). The cell lysates were spun at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet insoluble material. The supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting followed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The chemiluminescence signal on the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was directly captured by FujiFilm LAS-1000 plus system with 1,300,000-pixel cooled CCD camera that has 3.7-order of magnitude linearity. Quantification was carried out within the linear range using the Image Gauge version 3.2 software (FujiFilm). GFP-CFTR and Dyn2-GFP were detected with polyclonal GFP antibody (1:1000; BD Biosciences, Boston, MA). HA-CAL was detected with monoclonal HA antibody (1:2000; Roche Applied Sciences). Tubulin was detected with monoclonal tubulin antibody (1: 1000; Sigma).Surface Biotinylation—Surface biotinylation of CFTR at the plasma membrane was described previously (11.Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R. Li M. Stanton B.A. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3520-3529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell surface proteins were labeled with cell-impermeable EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate; Pierce) at 4 °C for 15 min. The cell surface proteins were isolated by incubating with immobilized NeutrAvidin beads at 4 °C for 2 h (Pierce; catalog number 53151). The bound proteins were eluted with 2× Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 100 mm dithiothreitol at 42 °C for 30 min. The eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting followed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). GFP-CFTR was detected with polyclonal GFP antibody (1:1000; BD Biosciences).Pulse-Chase—COS-7 cells were washed twice in methionine/cysteine-free DMEM and then incubated for 30 min in methionine/cysteine free-DMEM. The cells were incubated in methionine/cysteine free DMEM containing TRAN-35S-label (250 μCi/ml) for 30 min. Subsequently, the cells were washed extensively with DMEM containing 10 mm of unlabeled methionine and 10 mm of unlabeled cysteine and chased in this solution for the indicated times. Radiolabeled CFTR was immunoprecipitated with M3A7 and L12B14 monoclonal antibodies (Upstate, Waltham, MA), separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. The radioactive signal on the dried SDS-PAGE was scanned with a FujiFilm BAS-100 system (FujiFilm). Quantification was carried out within the linear range using the Image Gauge version 3.2 software (FujiFilm).Confocal Microscopy—COS-7 cells were plated on glass coverslips 1 day before transfection. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.2% Nonidet P-40 1 day post-transfection. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% normal goat serum. The cells were stained with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:2000; Roche Applied Sciences) in 5% normal goat serum, washed with 1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with goat anti-mouse Cy3 secondary antibodies in 1% normal goat serum (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). The GFP signal was detected by its fluorescence. The specimens were mounted and viewed on the UltraVIEW spinning disk confocal microscope (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Calculation of Degradation—The percentage of bafilomycin A1-sensitive CFTR degradation was calculated as follows: [CFTRbafilomycin A1-treated – CFTRuntreated]/CFTRbafilomycin A1-treated × 100%.Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. We assigned significance at p < 0.05.RESULTSIs Expression of Mature CFTR Protein Influenced by CAL?— Co-expression of CAL reduces the total cellular CFTR (23.Gentzsch M. Cui L. Mengos A. Chang X.B.

To confirm these observations, we co-transfected GFP-CFTR into COS-7 cells with different concentrations of either HA- or Myc-tagged CAL. GFP-CFTR was previously shown to have the single channel properties and intracellular trafficking patterns similar to that of wild type CFTR (28.Moyer B.D. Loffing J. Schwiebert E.M. Loffing-Cueni D.

Fig. 1 depicts the steady state levels of CFTR, HA-CAL, and tubulin, which is used to assess protein loading. Note that CFTR resolves into two bands that are well known to correspond to the upper mature C-band (fully glycosylated) and the lower immature B band (core glycosylated) of CFTR (29.Cheng S.H.

Note that expression of either type of tagged CAL construct significantly reduced steady state levels of the mature band of CFTR assayed at 48 h post-transfection.

Chem. 2003; 278: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the effects of CAL on mature CFTR were dose-dependent and independent of the epitope tags. Both results argue that CAL down-regulates CFTR mature protein in a specific fashion. For example, the abundance of tubulin, a cytoskeleton protein, was not affected by either HA-CAL (Fig. 1, A and C) or Myc-CAL (Fig. 1, B and C). Likewise, co-expression of HA-CAL or Myc-CAL did not affect the expression of GFP, a cytosolic protein, or GFP-frizzled 4, a membrane protein (data not shown). Neither GFP nor frizzled 4 binds to CAL (11.Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R. Li M. Stanton B.A. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3520-3529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). All of the GFP-tagged proteins used have the same cytomegalovirus promoters, eliminating a nonspecific effect on promoter activity. In addition, NHE-RF has no effect on the abundance of mature CFTR (11.Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R. Li M. Stanton B.A. Guggino W.B. J. Biol.

These data suggest that CAL does not down-regulate GFP-CFTR by reducing its transcription (see more on pulse-chase experiments later) or by acting on the GFP moiety of the fusion proteins.To verify these results further, the effect of CAL on CFTR was investigated in cells stably expressing a low level of CFTR. This cell line was created by transfecting COS-7 cells with GFP-CFTR, followed by selection and expansion of isolated G418-resistant colonies. One resultant clone, 4F2, was obtained that expressed one-tenth of the GFP-CFTR cells transiently transfected with 3 μg of GFP-CFTR/100-mm dish (data not shown). In these cells, HA-CAL also reduced the steady state levels of CFTR (Fig. 2C, third lane is 65.6 ± 6.8% of first lane; p < 0.05, n = 3).Fig. 2Bafilomycin A1 reverses CAL-mediated reduction of CFTR. A, COS-7 Cells were co-transfected with GFP-CFTR and HA-CAL. Either the lysosome inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (1 μm) or the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 μm) was added 24 h post-transfection. The cells were lysed, and the proteins were detected by Western blotting as described in the legend to Fig. 1.

C, the COS-7 cell line, 4F2, stably expressing a low amount of GFP-CFTR was transfected with HA-CAL (6 μg/dish). Bafilomycin A1 (1 μm) was added 24 h post-transfection. The cells were lysed, and the proteins were detected as described above. D, the percentage of bafilomycin A1-sensitive CFTR degradation in 4F2. The data are the means of three experiments.

As shown in Fig. 2A, treatment with bafilomycin A1, a lysosomal proton pump inhibitor (30.Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar), increases steady state protein levels of CFTR. Our data combined with previous findings obtained with other lysosome blocking agents (10.Benharouga M. Haardt M. Kartner N. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 11.Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R. Li M. Stanton B.A. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3520-3529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) suggest that lysosomal degradation is an important process in regulating mature CFTR abundance. Important for this study is that bafilomycin A1 reverses CAL-mediated reduction in mature CFTR (Fig. 2A). Fig 2A (first and third lanes) shows the typical effect of CAL on mature CFTR. In the absence of bafilomycin A1, CAL-transfected cells have significantly less mature CFTR than in cells not transfected with CAL (Fig. 2A, third lane is 57.1 ± 4.2% of first lane; p < 0.05, n = 3). Importantly, after 24–48 h of bafilomycin A1 treatment, the effect of CAL is significantly reduced (Fig. 2A, fourth lane, is 75.7 ± 5.9% of second lane; p > 0.05, n = 3). The effect of bafilomycin is likely underestimated. Some CAL-induced reduction in mature CFTR was expected to take place prior to the addition of bafilomycin midway, at 24 h posttransfection. Thus, some CAL-induced reduction in mature CFTR was expected to take place prior to the addition of bafilomycin. Fig. 2B depicts the extent of CFTR bafilomycin A1 sensitivity (see “Experimental Procedures”). At 24–48 h posttransfection, ∼27.93 ± 2.85% of CFTR is bafilomycin-sensitive. In contrast, in cells transfected with 6 μg of HA-CAL/100-mm dish, ∼49.55 ± 7.62% of CFTR is bafilomycin-sensitive (p < 0.01). The reversal of CAL-mediated reduction of mature CFTR by bafilomycin A1 is also reproduced in the stable cell line 4F2 (Fig. 2C, fourth lane is 77.8 ± 9.6% of second lane; p > 0.05, n = 3; whereas Fig. 2C, third lane is 65.6 ± 6.8% of first lane, p < 0.05, n = 3). More importantly, transfection of HA-CAL leads to an increase in the extent of bafilomycin A1-sensitive degradation of CFTR (Fig. 2D). These results strongly suggested that CAL plays a key role in regulating the bafilomycin A1-sensitive degradation of CFTR. On the other hand, treating CAL-transfected cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 did not rescue mature GFP-CFTR (Fig. 2A) back to the control levels observed in the absence of CAL. In contrast to bafilomycin A1 treatment, in the presence of CAL, MG132 actually reduced levels of mature CFTR. It has been observed by several investigators that proteasome inhibition does not increase the maturation of CFTR (31.Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 32.Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). MG132 did not increase immature CFTR in the Nonidet P-40 lysates probably because blocking of proteosomal degradation leads to the accumulation of CFTR into a detergent-insoluble polyubiquitinated form of immature CFTR (32.Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). The failure of MG132 to inhibit CAL reduction of mature CFTR is further evidence that CAL can function downstream of the proteosome and influence the degradation of mature CFTR.What Is the Effect of CAL on CFTR Maturation?—The steady state level of mature CFTR is determined by new protein synthesis and the trafficking and maturation of CFTR from ER to Golgi as well as post-Golgi degradation. To eliminate the possibility that, in addition to enhancing the degradation of mature CFTR in the lysosome, CAL decreases CFTR synthesis and/or maturation, we examined the synthesis and maturation of CFTR by metabolic labeling and pulse-chase experiments. In Fig. 3A, COS-7 cells transfected with GFP-CFTR with or without HA-CAL were metabolically pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and cysteine for 30 min at 16 h post-transfection. The cells were then chased in medium supplemented with unlabeled methionine and cysteine for 1–4 h to follow the maturation of CFTR. The lower band (Fig. 3A, band B) is the newly synthesized CFTR in ER that appears first. Not all newly synthesized CFTR is converted to mature CFTR (band C, upper band); because CFTR folds inefficiently, most of band B is degraded by ER-associated degradation (8.Kopito R.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S167-S173Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that GFP-CFTR matures similarly whether transfected or not transfected with CAL. Therefore, CAL exerts its effects on mature CFTR and does not affect the synthesis and trafficking to Golgi. To te"

Apoptosis is required to maintain the balance between cell proliferation and cell death. Nuclear collapse and DNA fragmentation are universal features of apoptosis in nucleated cells. However, the nucleus itself is not required for apoptosis, since apoptotic stimuli induce apoptotic morphological features in anucleate cells (1Schulze-Osthoff K. Walczak H. Droge W. Krammer P.H. J.

While the process of apoptosis has been studied in-depth in nucleated cells, the role of apoptosis regulatory molecules in anucleate cells is poorly understood. The anucleate mature circulating human erythrocyte is cleared by macrophages after its 120-day life span. The senescent erythrocyte shares at least one feature in common with nucleated cells undergoing apoptosis. The externalization of PS on the outer leaflet of the red cells results in recognition by macrophages probably through a receptor that engages PS (4Fadok V.A. Xue D. Henson P. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).

Proteases play a critical role in the expression of mammalian apoptosis. The caspases are a specialized family of cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases (5Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M.

Caspase activation is a critical event in the onset of apoptosis (5Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2448) Google Scholar). Human caspase 3 is perhaps the most universal apoptosis mediator. It is present in most mammalian cells (8Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y.

We speculate that loss of anchorage of the lipid bilayer to the cytoskeleton could also contribute to the loss of membrane integrity that is a feature of erythrocyte senescence. The two most abundant integral membrane proteins in the human erythrocyte membrane are the sialoglycoprotein, glycophorin and the anion exchanger, band 3. Both play a crucial structural role in linking the bilayer with the spectrin-based skeletal network. There are 1.2 × 106 copies of band 3 per cell of which 40-60% is associated with the spectrin-based skeleton. Erythrocyte band 3 is a multifunctional protein with its N- and C-terminal domains on the cytoplasmic face of the lipid bilayer and ∼14 membrane spans (17Lee A. Morrow J.S. Fowler V.M. J. Biol.

The non-erythroid counterpart of the major erythrocyte membrane cytoskeletal protein spectrin is a substrate of caspase 3. The caspase 3 cleavage sites on both α- and β-nonerythroid spectrin (16Wang K.K.W. Postmantur R. Nath R. McGinnis K. Whitton M. Talanian R.V. Glantz S.B. Morrow J.S. J. Biol.

Since little is known about the molecular consequences of caspase activation in red cells, we have chosen to address this question by attempting to identify the substrates of caspase 3 in the mature human erythrocyte. In the present study we have tested the possibility that the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 may contain caspase 3 cleavage sites. Proteolysis at these sites could potentially alter each of the characteristics of red cell structure and function regulated by the N-terminal CDB3. We demonstrate for the first time that CDB3 is indeed a substrate for caspase 3. We have identified two specific but non-conventional cleavage sites of caspase 3 on CDB3. We also demonstrate that CDB3 expressed in HEK293 cells undergoes staurosporine-induced degradation, which can be blocked by caspase 3 inhibitor; and that this impairs the interaction of CDB3 with the cytoskeletal protein 4.2. Defining CDB3 as a caspase substrate suggests a mechanism by which caspase 3 activation in human erythrocytes under conditions such as oxidative stress, might lead to important consequences such as uncoupling of the bilayer from the underlying spectrin-based skeleton, and modulation of glucose metabolism. That caspase 3 is likely to have a physiological role in erythrocytes, is best supported by our observations that active caspase 3 is present in aged red cells but not in young cells, and that this red cell-derived caspase 3 is capable of cleaving band 3 present in inside-out vesicles prepared from young red cells. Our demonstration, for the first time, that active caspase 3 is present in density-separated aged erythrocytes as opposed to young cells, is the best evidence that caspase 3 is likely to play a physiological role in the mature human erythrocyte. Materials—The plasmids containing human caspase 3 and caspase 8 in pET 15b were gifts from Kevin Wang, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. Band 3 cDNA was a gift from Joseph Casey, University of Alberta, Edmonton. The caspase 3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk was a product of CN Biosciences, San Diego, CA, staurosporine (STS) was from Roche Applied Science. Protein A/G-agarose, anti-caspase 3 antibody, and goat anti-rabbit IgG linked to alkaline phosphatase were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. Antibody against cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverley, MA; anti-FLAG antibody was from Sigma Chemical Co., and anti-His antibody was from Roche Applied Science. Purification of Recombinant Caspase 3—Caspase 3 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) by induction with 0.5 mm isopropylthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 25 °C and purified from the cytosol of the expressed cells by affinity chromatography on Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). Cloning and Expression of the N-terminal Cytoplasmic Domain of Band 3 (CDB3)—The gene encoding amino acids 1-390 of CDB3 was amplified from band 3 cDNA by PCR using the primers 5′-CGC GGA TCC ATG GAG GAG CTG CAG GAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTA GCG GCG CCG GAT ATC-3′ (antisense), digested with BamHI (underlined) and cloned in the vector pBAD-HisB (Invitrogen) between the BglII and PvuII sites to generate the vector pBD101 encoding residues 1-390 of band 3 with an N-terminal His tag. E. coli Top10/pBD101 was grown to an OD600 of 0.6. Arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.002%, and growth was continued at 37 °C with shaking for 4 h. Cells were harvested, reconstituted in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (PBS), and kept at -70 °C overnight. Frozen cells were thawed and treated with 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 5 mm DTT, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 containing 1 μg/ml DNase, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.1 mm pefabloc for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was loaded on a Ni2+-NTAagarose column equilibrated in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 m NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (buffer A). After washing the column with 100 mm imidazole in buffer A, N-terminally His-tagged CDB3 was eluted with 200 mm imidazole in buffer A. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the principle of overlap extension PCR (31Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar) using primers detailed below. The first rounds of PCR were performed with primer pairs a and b for one reaction and primer pairs c and d for the second reaction. The second round of PCR was performed using the products of the first round as templates and the primers a and d. Sequencing was done on both strands to confirm incorporation of the mutations. Primers b and c were respectively 5′-ACAGCCACAGCCTACCACACC-3′ and 5′-GGTGTGGTAGGCTGTGGCTGT-3′ for the mutation D45A; 5′-ACAGCCACAGAATACCACACC-3′ and 5′-GGTGTGGTATTCTGTGGCTGT-3′ for the mutation D45E; 5′-GAGCAGGGAGCTGGGGGCACA-3′ and 5′-TGTGCCCCCAGCTCCCTGCTC-3′ for the mutation D205A; 5′-GAGCAGGGAGAAGGGGGCACA-3′ and 5′-TGTGCCCCCTTCTCCCTGCTC-3′ for the mutation D205E. Primers a and d were 5′-CGCGGATCCATGGAGGAGCTGCAGGAT-3′ and 5′-GTAGCGGCGCCGGATATCACGCACCAG-3′, respectively. Cloning in pcDNA 3.1(-) and pFLAG-CMV-6b—The genes encoding wild-type and mutant CDB3 were amplified by PCR with the primer pair 5′-CCA CCA TGG AGG AGC TGC AGG ATG ATT AT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCC AAG CTT CTA CAC AGG CAT GGC CAC TTC-3′ (antisense) and cloned into the vector pcDNA3.1(-) (Invitrogen) between the EcoRV and HindIII (underlined) sites. An N-terminal Kozak sequence (-CCACC-) was introduced just upstream of the intiation codon and a stop codon was incorporated in the antisense primer. All the clones were sequenced. The protein 4.2 gene was amplified from the protein 4.2 cDNA in pGEM-3z using the primer pair 5′-AAGGATCCATATGGGACAGGCACTGGGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGCTGATAGTTCAGGGGCTACCACGGT-3′ (antisense), digested with BamHI (underlined) and cloned between the BglII and EcoRV sites of pFLAG-CMV-6b (Sigma Chemical Co.). The N-terminal 690 bp of the 4.2 gene (encoding the N-terminal 230 amino acids) was amplified using the same sense primer and the antisense primer 5′-GGTGGGCAGGACCCTCTGCTCCTTGAG-3′ and cloned as described above. Preparation of Ghosts and Purification of CDB3—Human blood was obtained from normal healthy volunteers. Ghosts were prepared by washing cells thrice with 15 volumes of PBS followed by lysis in lysis buffer (6.8 mm Na2HPO4, 2.25 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0 containing 10 μg/ml pefabloc, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). CDB3 was prepared from ghosts according to Bennett (32Bennett V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) after chymotryptic cleavage from spectrin-depleted, acid-stripped vesicles. Purified red cell CDB3 was used to raise polyclonal antibody in rabbits. This antibody recognized the 43 kDa N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of band 3 and all subfragments of this domain. Preparation of Inside-Out Vesicles (IOV)—IOV were prepared by treating ghosts with 30 volumes of 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 8.5 for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C as described by Korsgren and Cohen (33Korsgren C. Cohen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5536-5543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicles were washed once with the same buffer. Separation of Young and Aged Red Blood Cells on Percoll-Bovine Serum Albumin Gradient—Density-dependent separation of red cells was performed as described by Corsi et al. (34Corsi D. Paiardini M. Crinelli R. Bucchini A. Magnani M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, the plasma was removed and erythrocytes were washed three times with 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm glucose (PBSG buffer), and layered at 25% hematocrit on a discontinuous Percoll (55-85%, v/v)-bovine serum albumin gradient (34Corsi D. Paiardini M. Crinelli R. Bucchini A. Magnani M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) followed by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 20 min at 20 °C. Young and aged erythrocytes were collected separately from the 68 and 84% Percoll layers respectively, and washed in PBSG buffer. Western Blotting—Proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking for 1 h with PBS-0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) containing 5% nonfat dry milk (NFDM), the blots were washed in PBS-T and probed with anti-CDB3 antibody (1:5,000) by incubation overnight at 4 °C. After three washes in PBS-T containing 0.5% NFDM, the blots were incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:2,000). The blots were then washed three times with PBS-T containing 0.5% NFDM and developed by chemiluminescence using the Lumiglo reagent (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverley, MA). When performing Western blotting for detection of caspases, 6 × 105 cells were pelleted and freeze-thawed three times in 20 μl of cell extraction buffer (50 mm PIPES/NaOH (pH 6.5), 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 5 mm DTT, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm pefabloc). The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected for the detection of caspases. In Vitro Proteolysis of CDB3 and Recombinant CDB3 by Caspase 3—Purified red cell CDB3 or recombinant CDB3 (1 μg) was incubated with purified recombinant caspase 3 (0.2 μg) or caspase 8 (0.2 μg) in 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) containing 10 mm DTT and 10% (v/v) glycerol at 25 °C for 120 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Triplicate samples were subjected to electrophoresis. One gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, whereas two other samples were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. One blot was subjected to Western blotting using anti-CDB3 antibody. The other blot was used for N-terminal sequencing of bands predicted to be derived from band 3 by development with antiband 3 antibody. N-terminal Sequencing—After SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer, the desired bands were cut out and subjected to N-terminal sequencing in an Applied Biosystems protein sequencer at the protein sequencing facility of Eurosequence, Groningen, The Netherlands. Cell Culture and Transfection—The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 was obtained from the National Centre for Cell Science, Pune, India. Cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Cells were transfected using the Polyfect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells (6 × 105/well) were plated on 35-mm dishes and grown to 50-70% confluence. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with Polyfect complex (formed by incubating 2 μg of DNA and 20 μl of Polyfect reagent in 100 μl of serum-free MEM for 15 min) in 2 ml of complete MEM. After 5 h of incubation, medium was replaced with fresh MEM, and growth was permitted for another 36 h. For co-transfection experiments, 1 μg of each DNA was used. Immunoprecipitation Experiments—HEK293 cells after treatment were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 10 mm Na-β -glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm pefabloc, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant, where required, was incubated overnight with 1:100 dilution of polyclonal anti-CDB3 antibody at 4 °C followed by addition of 5 μl of protein A/G-agarose. After incubation for 3 h at 4 °C, the beads were pelleted, washed once in lysis buffer, boiled in SDS gel denaturing buffer, and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels prior to Western blotting. Red cells were lysed with 5 volumes of 7.5 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA and 10 mm DTT. Immunoprecipitates were prepared by incubation overnight with 1:100 dilution of anti-caspase 3 antibody (C-277, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by addition of protein A/G-agarose as described above. Caspase 3 Activity Assay—DEVD-dependent protease activity was determined using Ac-DEVD-pNA as substrate and the immunosorbent caspase 3 activity assay kit from Roche Applied Science. Briefly, caspase 3 was captured from lysates from 100-μl erythrocytes (5% hematocrit) in microtiter plates coated with anti-caspase 3 monoclonal antibody. Following washing the plates, Ac-DEVD-pNA was added and the released pNA was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. A pNA calibration curve was plotted from a pNA stock solution and the caspase 3 activity was measured relative to this curve. Apoptosis Induction—HEK293 cells were grown in 6-well plates and transfected as described above. Apoptosis was induced by adding 10 μm STS followed by incubation for 24 h. Where indicated, cells were incubated with Z-DEVD-fmk 1 h prior to STS treatment. After incubation, cells were resuspended in SDS gel denaturing buffer, and proteins were denatured at 100 °C for 3 min. Cleavage of IOV with Caspase 3 Immunoprecipitates from Young and Aged Erythrocytes—IOV were incubated at 37 °C with caspase 3 immunoprecipitates obtained from lysates of young and aged erythrocytes (described above) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 containing 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, and 0.5% Nonidet P40. The assay was carried out in the presence or absence of the caspase 3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk (10 μM). Samples were separated on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels, electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with polyclonal anti-CDB3 antibody as described earlier. In Vitro Degradation of CDB3 by Recombinant Caspase 3—We have previously shown that mature human erythrocytes contain caspase 3, and that caspase 3 can be activated under oxidative stress (10Mandal D. Moitra P. Saha S. Basu J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Cytoskeletal proteins such as spectrin have previously been demonstrated to be substrates of caspase 3 (16Wang K.K.W. Postmantur R. Nath R. McGinnis K. Whitton M. Talanian R.V. Glantz S.B.

The possibility that CD4, when localized to non-raft domains, might be able to support virus entry cannot be excluded. Because disintegration of rafts by extraction of cellular cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin suffers from various adverse effects, we investigated molecular determinants controlling raft localization of the CD4 receptor. Extensive mutagenesis of the receptor showed that a raft-localizing marker, consisting of a short sequence of positively charged amino acid residues, RHRRR, was present in the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic domain of CD4. Substitution of the RHRRR sequence with alanine residues abolished raft localization of the CD4 mutant, RA5, as determined biochemically using solubilization in nonionic detergents and by confocal microscopy. The possible inhibitory effect of the introduced mutations on the adjacent CVRC palmitoylation site was ruled out because wild type (wt) CD4 and RA5, but not a palmitoylation-deficient mutant, were efficiently palmitoylated. Nonetheless, the RA5 mutant supported productive virus entry to levels equivalent to that of wild type (wt) CD4. Sucrose gradient analysis of Triton X-100 virus lysates showed that Gag and envelope gp120 proteins accumulated in low buoyant, high-density fractions. This pattern was changed after virus incubation with cells. Whereas Gag proteins localized to lipid rafts in cells expressing wt CD4 and RA5, gp120 accumulated in rafts in cells expressing wt CD4 but not RA5. We propose that raft localization of CD4 is not required for virus entry, however, post-binding fusion/entry steps may require lipid raft assembly.

Although this role is still unclear, it seems likely that rafts represent privileged sites for virus binding to CD4, by concentrating CD4 in these domains. The interaction of viral glycoprotein envelope gp120 with CD4 (1.Dalgleish A.G. Beverley P.C. Clapham P.R. Crawford D.H. Greaves M.F. Weiss R.A.

In addition, gp120-CD4 interaction stimulates receptor phosphorylation on serine residues (6.Fields A.P. Bednarik D.P. Hess A. May W.S. Nature. 1988; 333: 278-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) that may lead to separation of CD4 from the noncovalently interacting tyrosine kinase p56 Lck and subsequent receptor endocytosis (7.Pitcher C.

Although conformation and function of these coreceptors depend on membrane cholesterol (13.Liao Z. Cimakasky L.M. Hampton R. Nguyen D.H. Hildreth J.E. AIDS Res. Hum.

Gradini R. Pavan A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) during virus entry (17.Hug P. Lin H.-M.J. Korte T. Xiao X. Dimitrov D.S. Wang J.M. Puri A. Blumenthal R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6377-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), HIV-1 coreceptors may localize to microdomains different from that occupied by CD4 (18.Sorice M. Parolini I. Sansolini T.

Fantini J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5244-5248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, activation of the entry process through engagement of CD4 and one of the coreceptors, would require a mechanism allowing for the apposition of the entry receptors in the same membrane environment. Consequently, it has been suggested that coreceptors may migrate into rafts after HIV-1 gp120-induced clustering (16.Sorice M. Garofalo M. Misasi R. Longo A. Mattei V. Sale P. Dolo V. Gradini R. Pavan A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20.Manes S. del Real G. Lacalle R.A. Lucas P. Gomez-Mouton C. Sanchez-Palomino S. Delgado R. Alcami J. Mira E. Martinez A.C. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). This may result in destabilization of raft membranes required for fusion and entry of virus (21.Kozak S.L. Heard J.M. Kabat D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the CD4-HIV-1 complexes may exit lipid rafts for the interaction with coreceptors localized in a non-raft, fusion-competent environment. Thus, in both models the role of lipid rafts would be limited to initial interaction with CD4 localized in these domains. However, the subsequent steps leading to virus fusion and entry would differ.Because CD4 almost totally localizes to lipid rafts, we could not exclude the possibility that CD4, if present outside these microdomains, could also support virus fusion and entry. This possibility was emphasized by the observation that fusion of alphaviruses depended on the presence of cholesterol and sphingolipids rather than intact lipid rafts in the target membrane (22.Waarts B.-L. Bittman R. Wilschut J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38141-38147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Methods known to disintegrate rafts rely on the extraction of cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin and suffer from numerous problems including toxicity, indiscriminate extraction of cholesterol from cell membranes, and various unexpected side effects. Thus, in this study, the significance of raft localization of CD4 in virus entry was addressed by using an approach based on the analysis of molecular determinant(s) controlling localization of this receptor to lipid microdomains without perturbation of cellular membranes.Extensive mutagenesis of CD4 revealed that neither extracellular nor transmembrane domains of the receptor play a significant role in raft association. We have, however, identified a novel raft-localizing marker in the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic domain of CD4. When this positively charged RHRRR motif was substituted with alanine residues, CD4 was redirected to non-raft membranes despite its intact palmitoylation and the presence of the Lck binding motif. However, similar to wild type receptor, this CD4 mutant efficiently supported HIV-1 entry, suggesting that raft localization of CD4 is not required for productive virus entry. Based on our findings, we propose a new model of CD4-mediated virus fusion in non-raft membrane regions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—GM3-derived 3′-N-acetylneuraminyl lactose (3′-sialyllactose) was from Calbiochem.

Monoclonal anti-CD4-FITC (13B8.2) was from Immunotech and monoclonal anti-CD71 IgG1 was from Beckman Coulter.Cell Cultures—Human PM1 T cells and BJAB B cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with l-glutamine (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Gemini Bio-Products, CA) and gentamicin (50 μg/ml). Human 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, and gentamicin.Treatment with 3′ Sialyllactose—PM1 cells (5 × 106) were washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of 1% BSA in PBS (BSA/PBS). 100 μg of 3′-sialyllactose was added and the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with ice-cold BSA/PBS, and were either processed for confocal microscopy or were infected with NL env(-)luc(+) virus pseudotyped with HXB2 envelope and analyzed for virus entry.Construction of CD4-GFP and CD4-GFP Mutants—The full-length cDNA encoding CD4 in pCG.CD4 vector was obtained from J. Skowronski (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). The CD4 coding region was amplified by PCR with the 5′ primer designed to contain a EcoRI restriction site (underlined) followed by Kozak sequence and the first 24 nucleotides of CD4. The sense orientation of the primer is presented: GCTTCGAATTCTCGCCACCATGAACCGGGGAGTCCCTTTTAGG. The 3′ primer (sense orientation) contained the coding sequence from the last 21 nucleotides of CD4 without a stop codon and an XmaI site (underlined): CAGAAGACATGTAGCCCCATTGCCCGGGATCCA. The PCR product containing full-length CD4 cDNA was digested with EcoRI and XmaI and cloned into respective sites of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), creating the CD4-GFP construct. The coding region of the construct was confirmed by sequence analysis; functional expression and membrane localization were confirmed by transfection into 293T or BJAB cells and confocal microscopy. The resulting CD4-GFP fusion protein contains an 8-amino acid linker, ARDPPVAT, which connects the carboxyl terminus of CD4 with the first methionine residue of the GFP protein. The CD4-GFP mutants were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to a protocol provided by the manufacturer. Primers used in site-directed mutagenesis reactions are available upon request. CD4 amino acid numbering is according to Swiss Prot P01730 and includes the 25-amino acid signaling peptide.Metabolic Labeling with [1-14C]Palmitic Acid—293T cells were grown in 60-mm dishes and transfected with wt CD4-GFP, RA5, or non-palmitoylated mutant CD4 C419, 422A. The next day, the cells were washed and incubated for 3 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% BSA supplemented with [1-14C]palmitic acid (80 μCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences). Radiolabeled cells were then washed three times in ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 TNE lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Diagnostics). CD4 was immunoprecipitated using anti-GFP 3E6 antibody and protein A/G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Washed immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filter, and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak).Virus Preparation and Single-cycle Infectivity Assay—A plasmid DNA encoding envelope from a T-tropic HIV-1 clone HXB2 (15 μg) was cotransfected with pNL4-3 env(-)luc(+) (10 μg) into 293T cells using SuperFect (Qiagen). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the culture supernatants were collected, filtered through 0.45-μm filters, and concentrated by ultracentrifugation through a cushion of 20% sucrose in PBS. The pelleted virus was resuspended in PBS with 0.1% BSA, aliquoted, and stored frozen at -80 °C. The virus titer was determined by the reverse transcriptase (RT) activity assay (23.Popik W. Pitha P.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2558-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).293T cells were plated in triplicate in 6- or 12-well Biocoat plates coated with fibronectin (BD Biosciences) 1 day prior to transfection with different CD4-GFP constructs. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells were incubated for 1 h with a standardized amount of pseudotyped viruses (5 cpm of RT/cell), washed, and the cultures were propagated for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. After incubation, the cells were washed and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was determined after adding 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) to 20 μl of precleared cell lysate and counting the resultant scintillation for 10 s using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). Background luciferase activity, determined by infection of cells with NL4-3 env(-)luc(+) virions produced in the absence of envelope protein was negligible (150 relative light units for 10 s counting).Biochemical Isolation of Lipid Rafts—Forty hours after transfection of BJAB cells (3-5 × 107) with different CD4-GFP constructs, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed on ice for 20 min in 1 ml of either 0.5% Triton X-100 or 0.5% W-1 TNE lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. The cell lysates were homogenized with 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 × g at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge to remove insoluble material and nuclei. The supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of 80% sucrose in lysis buffer, placed at the bottom of ultracentrifuge tubes, and overlaid with 6 ml of 30% and 3 ml of 5% sucrose in TNE lysis buffer. Lysates were ultracentrifuged at 4 °C in a SW41 rotor (Beckman) for 16-18 h at 38,000 rpm. Eleven 1-ml fractions were collected from the top with Auto Densi-Flow (Labconco) and analyzed by Western blotting or stored at -80 °C.Western Blot Analysis—Aliquots of 40 μl of individual sucrose gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with specific antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and the SuperSignal West Dura substrate (Pierce). Protein concentration was determined with the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Pierce).Raft Aggregation and Confocal Microscopy—A total of 1 × 106 CD4-positive PM1 T cells or 5 × 106 transfected BJAB cells were washed in serum-free RPMI and incubated on ice for 10 min with PBS supplemented with 1% BSA (ELISA grade; BSA/PBS). After centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of BSA/PBS and incubated on ice for 30 min with fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibodies at concentrations suggested by the manufacturer (typically 10 μg/ml) followed by extensive washing with ice-cold BSA/PBS. To investigate the presence of untagged CD4 in lipid rafts, the cells were first incubated for 30 min on ice with biotinylated CT-B and washed extensively with PBS/BSA. Lipid raft aggregation was initiated by incubation with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing, the cells were incubated on ice for 30 min with anti-CD4-FITC (clone 13B8.2), washed again, and fixed on ice for 15 min with fresh 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. To analyze localization of CD4-GFP receptor in transiently transfected BJAB cells, the ganglioside GM1-resident microdomains were aggregated with biotin-CT-B/streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 594, as described above or for detection of other surface antigens like CD71 or CD48, rafts were aggregated using biotin-CT-B/anti-biotin BN-34 antibody. After washing and incubation of the cells on ice for 30 min with anti-CD71 or anti-CD48 mouse antibodies labeled with the Zenon One Alexa Fluor 594 mouse IgG1 labeling kit, the cells were washed, fixed, and mounted using ProLong antifade kit. Fluorescently labeled cells were analyzed using Nikon PCM 2000 laser scanning confocal microscope with ×60 objective lenses. The images were processed using Photoshop software (Adobe).RESULTSCD4 Receptor Glycosylation Is Not Necessary for Association with Lipid Rafts—It has been reported that glycolipids can function as cofactors for HIV-1 fusion. The interaction between ganglioside GM3 and the CD4 receptor (24.Hammache D. Yahi N. Pieroni G. Ariasi F. Tamalet C. Fantini J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25.Sorice M. Garofalo T. Misasi R. Longo A. Mikulak J. Dolo V. Pontieri G.M. Pavan A. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and the observation that GM3 is enriched in lipid microdomains (26.Gomez-Mouton C. Abad J.L. Mira E. Lacalle R.A. Gallardo E. Jimenez-Baranda S. Illa I. Bernad A. Manes S. Martinez A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9642-9647Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), suggest that CD4 may localize to lipid rafts as a result of the interaction with GM3. However, treatment of CD4-positive PM1 T cells with GM3-derived 3′-sialyllactose, the oligosaccharide moiety of GM3 that interacts with CD4 (24.Hammache D. Yahi N. Pieroni G. Ariasi F. Tamalet C. Fantini J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), did not significantly affect the CD4 receptor expression and raft localization (Fig. 1A). Accordingly, productive entry of NL env(-)luc(+) pseudotyped with the HXB2 envelope was not considerably affected by pretreatment of PM1 T cells with 3′-sialyllactose (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that CD4-GM3 interaction is dispensable for raft localization and virus entry.Further investigation of the putative raft-localizing signals in CD4 was performed using CD4-negative B cells, BJAB, transiently transfected with the CD4-GFP fusion receptor in which GFP was fused in-frame to the carboxyl terminus of the CD4 receptor (Fig. 1C). The resulting GFP-tagged CD4 was expressed on the cell surface (see Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5) and supported productive virus entry as efficiently as untagged wt CD4 (Fig. 1D).Fig. 2Role of extracellular domains of CD4-GFP in lipid raft localization.A, wt CD4-GFP, two-domain mutants (D1-D2-GFP and D3-D4-GFP) and CD4 mutant with four deleted extracellular domains but with intact transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (TM-GFP) colocalize with GM1 (overlay) aggregated with biotin-CT-B and streptavidin Alexa Fluor 594 in transfected BJAB cells. B, one-domain, D4-GFP, or three-domain D1-D2-D4 mutants (d.D3-GFP) are not detectably expressed on the surface of transfected BJAB cells but are retained intracellularly. Cell membrane localization of raft markers GM1 and CD48 and non-raft marker CD71 in transfected cells with aggregated lipid rafts are shown. C, raft-localized D1-D2-GFP truncation mutant with intact HIV-1 envelope binding site does not support productive entry of NL env(-)luc(+) virus pseudotyped with the HXB2 envelope in transfected BJAB cells, nor the other mutants tested. Luciferase activity is expressed relative to the activity detected in cells transfected with wt CD4 (WT control), as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Standard deviations of three independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Transmembrane domain of CD4 is not critical for raft partitioning.

Localization of CD4, raft-resident CD48, and non-raft CD71 is shown. B, BJAB cells were transfected with GFP-tagged wt CD4, two different palmitoylation mutants, CD4 C419S,C422S and CD4 C419A,C422A, and Lck binding mutant CD4 C445A,C447A. After aggregation of rafts with biotin-CT-B/streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 594, colocalization of CD4 with raft marker GM1 (overlay) was visualized by confocal microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5The sequence RHRRR present in the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic domain of CD4 determines raft localization of the receptor.A, sucrose gradient distribution pattern of wt CD4 and its mutants, RH/AA, RRR/EEE, and RHRRR/A5 (RA5), were transiently expressed in BJAB cells. Localization of CD4 in raft and non-raft sucrose gradient fractions prepared from Triton X-100 or detergent W-1 cell lysates is shown. Localization of non-raft CD71 and raft-resident CD48 is also shown. B, exclusion of CD4 RA5 from lipid rafts was shown by confocal microscopy. After aggregation of rafts with biotin-CT-B/anti-biotin-Alexa Fluor 594 (top panel), localization of wt CD4, RA5, and GM1 was visualized by confocal microscopy. The two lower panels show localization of CD71 and CD48 labeled with Alexa Fluor 594 after aggregation of lipid rafts with biotin-CT-B/anti-biotin antibody. C, palmitoylation of wt CD4 (WT), CD4 RA5 (RA5), and non-palmitoylated mutant CD4 C419S,C422S (C/S) was analyzed in transfected BJAB cell lysates after metabolic labeling with [14C]palmitic acid as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)N-Glycans present on membrane proteins of non-lymphoid cells have been shown to mediate raft association, possibly through binding to lectin-like molecules residing in rafts (27.Benting J.H. Rietveld A.G. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To determine the role of N-glycosylation in CD4 sorting to rafts, N-glycosylation sites in CD4 were eliminated by substituting either Asn-296 or Asn-325 with glutamine residues (N296Q or N325Q, respectively). These CD4-GFP mutants were expressed on the cell membrane and colocalized with lipid raft-resident ganglioside GM1 (Fig. 1E) and were resistant to Triton X-100 extraction to the same degree as wt CD4 (Fig. 1F). In conclusion, neither association with ganglioside GM3 nor deletion of each N-glycosylation site was sufficient to change raft distribution of CD4.The Extracellular Domains of CD4 and Raft Association—To test the possibility that CD4 may localize to microdomains through the interaction of its extracellular domain with other raft-anchored proteins, we have created mutants with deletions in different extracellular domains of the receptor. The constructs were transiently transfected into BJAB cells and the localization of CD4-GFP mutants was investigated by confocal microscopy. Both wild type CD4-GFP as well as two-domain mutants, CD4 D1-D2-GFP and CD4 D3-D4-GFP, colocalized extensively with GM1 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, one-domain, CD4 D4-GFP, or three-domain D1-D2-D4 mutants (d.D3-GFP) were not detectably expressed on the cell surface and did not overlap with GM1, CD48, or CD71 (Fig. 2B). Intracellular expression of these mutants is most likely because of their misfolding and retention by quality control mechanisms (28.Arvan P. Zhao X. Ramos-Castaneda J. Chang A. Traffic. 2002; 3: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Interestingly, removing all four extracellular domains restored surface expression of the truncated CD4 TM-GFP (TM-GFP, Fig. 2A), supporting the idea that raft-localizing determinants may be present in transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains of the receptor.Because the primary binding site for HIV-1 gp120 is localized in domain D1 of CD4 (29.Arthos J. Dean K.C. Chalkin M.A. Fornwald J.A. Sathe G. Sattentau Q.J. Clapham P.R. Weiss R.A. McDougal J.S. Pietropaolo C. Axel R. Truneh A. Maddon P.J. Sweet R.W. Cell. 1989; 57: 469-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored CD4 D1-D2/Thy-1 chimeric receptor was shown to support virus entry and replication (30.Jasin M. Page K.A. Littman D.R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 440-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we analyzed whether the CD4 D1-D2-GFP receptor was able to support productive entry of NL env(-)luc(+) pseudotyped with the HXB2 envelope. Our results show that despite raft localization, the CD4 D1-D2-GFP did not support productive virus entry and replication (Fig. 2, A and C). This may suggest the importance of the remaining domains in virus entry or indicate that two-domain CD4 is not able to execute conformational changes in gp120, which would allow the envelope to interact with coreceptors.CD4 Transmembrane Domain Is Not Essential for Raft Localization—To analyze the role of the transmembrane (TM) region of CD4 in raft association, we created chimeric molecules in which the TM domain of CD4 was replaced with the corresponding region of non-raft resident transferrin receptor CD71 (CD4/TM CD71) or tyrosine phosphatase CD45 (CD4/TM CD45). The chimeric molecules contained intact extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of CD4. However, replacement of the TM domain of CD4 did not affect p"
https://openalex.org/W1988307230,"Trehalose is an unusual non-reducing disaccharide that plays a variety of biological roles, from food storage to cellular protection from environmental stresses such as desiccation, pressure, heat-shock, extreme cold, and oxygen radicals. It is also an integral component of the cell-wall glycolipids of mycobacteria. The primary enzymatic route to trehalose first involves the transfer of glucose from a UDP-glucose donor to glucose-6-phosphate to form α,α-1,1 trehalose-6-phosphate. This reaction, in which the configurations of two glycosidic bonds are set simultaneously, is catalyzed by the glycosyltransferase trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (OtsA), which acts with retention of the anomeric configuration of the UDP-sugar donor. The classification of activated sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases into approximately 70 distinct families based upon amino acid sequence similarities places OtsA in glycosyltransferase family 20 (see afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/). The recent 2.4 Å structure of <i>Escherichia coli</i> OtsA revealed a two-domain enzyme with catalysis occurring at the interface of the twin β/α/β domains. Here we present the 2.0 Å structures of the <i>E. coli</i> OtsA in complex with either UDP-Glc or the non-transferable analogue UDP-2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucose. Both complexes unveil the donor subsite interactions, confirming a strong similarity to glycogen phosphorylases, and reveal substantial conformational differences to the previously reported complex with UDP and glucose 6-phosphate. Both the relative orientation of the two domains and substantial (up to 10 Å) movements of an N-terminal loop (residues 9–22) characterize the more open ""relaxed"" conformation of the binary UDP-sugar complexes reported here."
https://openalex.org/W1975029652,"S100A10 is a key plasminogen receptor of the extracellular cell surface that is overexpressed in many cancer cells. Typically, S100A10 is thought to be anchored to the plasma membrane via the phospholipid-binding sites of its binding partner, annexin A2. Here, using the potent and highly sequence-specific mechanism of RNA interference (RNAi), we have stably silenced the expression of the S100A10 gene in colorectal (CCL-222) cancer cells. We show that siRNA expression mediated by the pSUPER vector causes efficient, stable, and specific down-regulation of S100A10 gene expression. The siRNA-mediated down-regulation of S100A10 gene expression resulted in a major decrease in the appearance of extracellular S100A10 protein and correlated with a 45% loss of plasminogen binding, a 65% loss in cellular plasmin generation and a complete loss in plasminogen-dependent cellular invasiveness. We also observed that the CCL-222 cells do not express annexin A2 on their extracellular surface. Thus, the data show that annexin A2 is not required by S100A10 for its association with the plasma membrane, for its colocalization with uPAR, or for its binding and activation of plasminogen."
https://openalex.org/W2003866350,"Pirin is a newly identified nuclear protein that interacts with the oncoprotein B-cell lymphoma 3-encoded (Bcl-3) and nuclear factor I (NFI). The crystal structure of human Pirin at 2.1-Å resolution shows it to be a member of the functionally diverse cupin superfamily. The structure comprises two β-barrel domains, with an Fe(II) cofactor bound within the cavity of the N-terminal domain. These findings suggest an enzymatic role for Pirin, most likely in biological redox reactions involving oxygen, and provide compelling evidence that Pirin requires the participation of the metal ion for its interaction with Bcl-3 to co-regulate the NF-κB transcription pathway and the interaction with NFI in DNA replication. Substitution of iron by heavy metals thus provides a novel pathway for these metals to directly influence gene transcription.

The structure suggests an interesting new role of iron in biology and that Pirin may be involved in novel mechanisms of gene regulation. Pirin is a newly identified nuclear protein that is widely expressed in dot-like subnuclear structures in human tissues, in particular liver and heart (1.Wendler W.M. Kremmer E. Forster R. Winnacker E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8482-8489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Pirins are highly conserved among mammals, plants, fungi, and even prokaryotic organisms and have been assigned as a sub-family of the cupin superfamily based on both structure and sequence homology (1.Wendler W.M.

Study of Pirin reveals two cupin domains from its primary sequence that are consistent with other members of the superfamily. The exact functions of Pirins are not yet known.

NFI is known to stimulate DNA replication and RNA polymerase II-driven transcription (4.Santoro C. Mermod N. Andrews P.C. Tjian R. Nature. 1998; 334: 218-224Crossref Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Bcl-3 is a distinctive member of the IκB family, which inhibits the transcription factor NF-κB by preventing NF-κB nuclear translocation and DNA binding. However, there is also evidence that Bcl-3 preferentially binds to NF-κB p50 or p52 homodimers to stimulate transcription (5.Lenardo M. Siebenlist U. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 145-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The functional nature of this difference between IκB (inhibiting) and Bcl-3 (enhancing) is not known, but it is clear that they bind to different protein partners. Pirin is one of four binding partners of Bcl-3, together with Bard1, Tip60, and Jab1, and can be sequestered into quaternary complexes with Bcl-3, p50, and DNA (3.Dechend R. Hirano F. Lehmann K.

These four Bcl-3-interacting protein partners, which do not share any sequence homology, might play some crucial role in regulating the function of Bcl-3 and IκB. Indeed, both Pirin and Bcl-3 are localized in the nucleus, and the potential roles of Pirin in NF-κB-dependent transcriptional regulation are implicated in a number of experiments (6.Schwarz E.M.

Understanding of the Pirin structure is of critical importance in elucidating and understanding its function, in particular its interaction with the IκB family of proteins in its role as a transcription cofactor. Cloning, Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—The complete gene fragment encoding human Pirin protein was subcloned into pET-28a expression vector from a human liver cDNA library, and the human Pirin was highly expressed as a soluble protein in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) with a 6-residue His tag attached to its N terminus. Purification of the Pirin protein was carried out through an affinity chromatography Co-NTA His Bind column (Qiagen) followed by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences). Crystals of Pirin were grown using the hanging drop-vapor diffusion method from a solution containing 25 mg/ml Pirin in 14% polyethylene glycol 20000, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, at 16 °C. For phase determination, a selenomethionyl derivative was produced and crystallized under similar conditions. The Pirin crystals belong to the space group P212121 with unit cell parameters a = 42.28, b = 67.12, c = 106.39 Å, α = β = γ = 90°. Structure Determination—Data sets were collected at three wavelengths from a single selenomethionine derivative crystal at 100 K on beamline BL44B2 of SPring-8. Data were collected to 2.1-Å resolution using energies corresponding to the peak (λ1 = 0.9795 Å) and edge (λ2 = 0.9799 Å) of the experimentally determined selenium K-edge, and a low energy remote wavelength (λ3 = 0.9817 Å). All processing, scaling, and merging of datasets were performed using the HKL2000 package (11.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Initial phases were calculated to 2.5-Å resolution with SOLVE (12.Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

D. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar) was used for density modification and phase extension to 2.1 Å. The Pirin model was built using ARP/wARP (14.Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar) and O (15.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

An initial round of simulated annealing was followed by alternate cycles of manual rebuilding and minimization. The final model contains 288 residues, 188 water molecules, and an Fe2+ ion. The position of the metal ion was evident as a peak greater than 16 σ in the Fo - Fc map. The Fe2+ ion was refined at full occupancy with a temperature factor of 17.5 Å2. The coordinating atoms His56 Nϵ2, His58 Nϵ2, His101 Nϵ2, and Glu103 Oϵ2 have temperature factors of 10.8, 18.1, 12.9, and 13.8 Å2, respectively. Identification of the Metal Ion—The metal ion bound in the N-terminal domain of Pirin was confirmed to be iron by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). The AAS experiments were performed in the Tsinghua Analysis Center using a Carl Zeiss Technology Analytic Jena AAS 6 Vario instrument. The presence of the metal ions Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ were analyzed. The results indicated that, after Co2+-affinity chromatography, only Fe2+ remained in the protein solution after gel-filtration chromatography on a Superdex-75 column (Amersham Biosciences) and equilibration in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl. Structure Determination—The structure of human Pirin was determined using the multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion method from a single selenomethionine derivative crystal. Details of the data collection and structure refinement are given in Table I. The asymmetric unit of the Pirin crystal contains one monomer. The electron density map is of high quality such that 288 out of 290 residues could be built. No density was observed for the two N-terminal residues, but the remainder of the Pirin molecule, including the C-terminal end of the polypeptide chain, is well defined (Fig. 1a). Two cis- proline residues could be identified in the structure (Pro31 and Pro50). The final model of the structure contains 288 residues, 188 water molecules, and 1 Fe2+ ion. The presence of iron was established by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and quantitative measurements showed that there is 1 mol of Fe2+ per mol of protein.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsMAD peakMAD edgeMAD remoteWavelength (Å)0.97950.97990.9817Resolution limit (Å)50.0-2.1 (2.18-2.10)50.0-2.1 (2.18-2.10)50.0-2.1 (2.18-2.10)Total reflections95,48595,27194,836Unique reflections30,97530,92730,894Completeness90.5 (81.5)90.4 (81.4)89.9 (79.8)RmergeaRmerge=∑h∑l|Iih-〈Ih〉|∑h∑I〈Ih〉, where 〈Ih〉 is the mean of the observations Iih of reflection h.5.0 (27.5)5.0 (28.8)5.0 (29.3)I/σ (I)7.3 (1.9)7.0 (1.8)6.8 (1.8)Resolution range50.0-2.1RworkbRwork=∑(||Fp(obs)|-|Fp(calc)||)/∑|Fp(obs)|; Rfree = R factor for a selected subset (5%) of the reflections that was not included in prior refinement calculations.20.6RfreebRwork=∑(||Fp(obs)|-|Fp(calc)||)/∑|Fp(obs)|; Rfree = R factor for a selected subset (5%) of the reflections that was not included in prior refinement calculations.24.9Number of protein atoms2,244Number of water molecules187r.m.s. deviationBonds (Å)0.006Angles (°)1.35Average B factor (Å2)Protein21.28Water29.35Ramachandran plotFavored (%)88.6Allowed (%)11.4a Rmerge=∑h∑l|Iih-〈Ih〉|∑h∑I〈Ih〉, where 〈Ih〉 is the mean of the observations Iih of reflection h.b Rwork=∑(||Fp(obs)|-|Fp(calc)||)/∑|Fp(obs)|; Rfree = R factor for a selected subset (5%) of the reflections that was not included in prior refinement calculations. Open table in a new tab Structural Overview—Pirin is composed of two structurally similar domains arranged face to face (Fig. 1, b and c). The core of each domain comprises two antiparallel β-sheets, with eight strands forming a β-sandwich. The fold of each domain is very similar, and the two domains can be superimposed with an r.m.s. difference of 1.3 Å for 64 equivalent residues. The N-terminal domain (residues 3-134) additionally features four β-strands, and the C-terminal domain (residues 143-290) also includes four additional β-strands and a short α-helix. The two domains are cross-linked, with β1 forming part of one sheet of the C-terminal domain, and strands β25 and β26 forming an extension of one sheet of the N-terminal domain. The C-terminal α-helix packs against the outer surface of the N-terminal domain β-barrel. The two domains are joined by a short linker of 10 amino acids (residues 134-143) that contains a single turn of a 310 helix. Four additional 310 helices are located in the structure. Similar cavities are found in each domain. In the N-terminal domain, the cavity contains a metal binding site with a single Fe2+ ion located at about 6 Å from the protein surface (Fig. 1d). The C-terminal domain cavity is more compact than the N-terminal domain and is closed by the β-strand formed by residues 6-12. The C-terminal domain does not contain any metal binding site. Pirin Is a Member of the Cupin Superfamily—It has been predicted that Pirin belongs to the cupin superfamily on the basis of primary sequence (2.Dunwell J.M. Culham A. Carter C.E. Sosa-Aguirre C.R. Goodenough P.W. Trends Biochem. Science. 2001; 26: 740-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). From a Dali (17.Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) search for structural similarity, the Pirin structure was confirmed to closely resemble members of the cupin superfamily (Fig. 2, a-f), particularly the structures of quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase (18.Fusetti F. Schroeter K.H. Steiner R.A. Van Noort P.I. Pijning T. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Egmond M.R. Dijkstra B.W. Structure. 2002; 10: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), glycinin g1 (19.Adachi M. Takenaka Y. Gidamis A.B. Mikami B. Utsumi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 305: 291-305Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and phosphomannose isomerase (20.Cleasby A. Wonacott A. Skarzynski T. Hubbard R.E. Davies G.J. Proudfoot A.E. Bernard A.R. Payton M.A. Wells T.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 470-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As with Pirin, these three proteins are bicupins with two germin-like β-barrel domains. Pirin also contains the two characteristic sequences of the cupin superfamily, namely PG-(X)5-HXH-(X)4-E-(X)6-G and G-(X)5-PXG-(X)2-H-(X)3-N separated by a variable stretch of 15-50 amino acids (Fig. 2g). These motifs are best conserved in the N-terminal domain (residues 49-71 and residues 88-105) where the conserved histidine and glutamic acid residues correspond to the metal-coordinating residues. The C-terminal domain motifs (residues 178-199 and residues 216-230) lack the metal binding residues normally associated with the cupin fold. The cupin superfamily has possibly the widest range of biochemical functions of any superfamily identified to date (2.Dunwell J.M. Culham A. Carter C.E. Sosa-Aguirre C.R. Goodenough P.W. Trends Biochem. Science. 2001; 26: 740-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). It is comprised of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic members, which have either one or two cupin domains. The cupin fold comprises a motif of six to eight antiparallel β-strands located within a conserved β-barrel structure (2.Dunwell J.M. Culham A. Carter C.E. Sosa-Aguirre C.R. Goodenough P.W. Trends Biochem. Science. 2001; 26: 740-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The variety of biochemical functions is reflected by the low sequence homology shared among the cupin superfamily members (Fig. 2g). A BLAST search for proteins homologous to human Pirin revealed significant conservation between mammals, plants, and prokaryotes, particularly within the N-terminal domain (1.Wendler W.M. Kremmer E. Forster R. Winnacker E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8482-8489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Interestingly, sequence alignment of human Pirin and related proteins reveals two clusters that are highly conserved throughout all aligned sequences. These sequence clusters, corresponding to residues 52-70 (cluster 1) and 88-106 (cluster 2), include the four metal coordinating residues of human Pirin, which are strictly conserved among all aligned sequences. Pirin (Fig. 2a) and the bicupin metalloenzymes quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase (Fig. 2b) and phosphomannose isomerase (Fig. 2d) show similarities in the overall fold. Quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase is a copper-containing enzyme, and its N-terminal domain can be superimposed onto the N-terminal domain of Pirin with an r.m.s. difference of 1.5 Å for 84 equivalent residues. The Cu-binding site of quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase, formed by 3 histidines, a glutamic acid residue and a single water molecule, matches the metal site of Pirin. The three histidines of Pirin (His56, His58, and His101) are structurally equivalent to those of quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase (His66, His68, and His112). Similarly, the phosphomannose isomerase structure can be superimposed onto that of Pirin with an r.m.s. difference of 1.3 Å for 71 equivalent residues. Phosphomannose isomerase is a zinc-containing enzyme, and its metal binding site, comprising two histidines and two glutamic acid residues, also matches the metal site of Pirin. Regardless of the overall structural similarity between its two domains, the C-terminal domain of Pirin shows interesting differences from the N-terminal domain. Notably, the C-terminal domain of Pirin does not contain a metal binding site and its sequence does not contain the conserved metal-coordinating residues. Several members of the cupin superfamily do not contain the metal-coordinating residues, including the transcription factor araC from Escherichia coli (21.Soisson S.M. MacDougall-Shackleton B. Schleif R. Wolberger C. Science. 1997; 276: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). araC is a single domain member of the cupin family and binds arabinose for activation of transcription. There are notable similarities between the C-terminal domain of Pirin and araC. In araC, the arabinose binding site is located within the β-barrel and is closed by an N-terminal domain arm. The β-barrel of the C-terminal domain of Pirin is also closed by the N-terminal β1 strand. However, in the absence of arabinose, the N-terminal arm of araC becomes disordered, suggesting that it is important for ligand stability. A detailed analysis of the arabinose binding residues in the araC structure shows that the C-terminal domain of Pirin is unlikely to bind arabinose. The Metal Binding Site—Surprisingly, a single Fe2+ ion is located in the Pirin N-terminal domain where it is coordinated by 3 histidine residues (His56, His58, and His101) through their Nϵ2 atoms, and one glutamic acid (Glu103) through the Oϵ2 atom (Fig. 3a). The metal binding site is exposed to the solvent, and the octahedral coordination environment is completed by two water molecules, with metal-ligand distances of 2.24 and 2.15 Å (Table II). A structure-based sequence alignment shows that the metal binding motif is highly conserved within a number of other cupin superfamily members (Fig. 2g). The metal binding domain of Pirin is most structurally similar to that in germin, a Mn2+-containing oxalate oxidase in which the metal is also octahedrally coordinated by three histidines, a glutamic acid and two water molecules (22.Anand R. Dorrestien P.C. Kinsland C. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7659-7669Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). As with quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase, the three histidines in oxalate oxidase (His88, His90, and His137) are structurally equivalent to those in Pirin (His56, His58, and His101). One notable difference between Pirin and related metalloproteins of the cupin superfamily is the location of the coordinating Glu residue. Quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase (Fig. 3b), phosphomannose isomerase (Fig. 3c), and oxalate oxidase (Fig. 3d) all contain a conserved Glu residue in the equivalent structural position to residue 63 of Pirin. However, this residue is not conserved in Pirin and the coordinating Glu residue is instead located in position 103 on β-strand 10.Table IIMetal-donor atom distances and temperature factorsDistance to metal ionTemperature factorÅÅ2Fe2+17.5His56 Nϵ22.0710.8His58 Nϵ22.1218.1His101 Nϵ22.3212.9Glu103 Oϵ22.2813.8Water 12.2419.1Water 22.1522.4 Open table in a new tab The structure of a nickel-binding dioxygenase, acireductone dioxygenase (Ni-ARD) from Klebsiella pneumoniae, was recently determined by NMR and its active site modeled by comparative homology modeling (23.Pochapsky T.C. Pochapsky S.S. Ju T. Mo H. Al-Mjeni F. Maroney M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It was suggested that ARD might also be a member of the cupin superfamily. The Ni2+ ion in ARD was predicted to be coordinated by six ligands, namely three histidine residues, a glutamic acid, and two water molecules. The spatial arrangement of ligand groups in the Ni-ARD model is similar to that of Pirin and germin, with an average distance of 2.1 Å between the metal and donor atoms. Potential Functions of Pirin—The bound metal ion may play an important role in Pirin function by stabilizing the N-terminal cupin domain structure and/or by imparting enzymatic activity to the protein. The iron found in the structure is the metal cofactor in numerous enzymes spanning a wide spectrum of activities. Metal-dependent Transcriptional Regulation—Pirins are putative transcription cofactors. Heavy metals are known to play an important role in the transcriptional regulation of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes (24.DeMoor J.M. Koropatnick D.J. Cell Mol. Biol. (Noisy-le-grand). 2000; 46: 367-381PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem.

Sci. 2001; 31: 91-98PubMed Google Scholar). Pirin is newly identified in this study to be a metal-binding protein, and, interestingly, the metal-binding residues of Pirins are highly conserved across mammals, plants, fungi, and prokaryotic organisms. Pirin acts as a cofactor for the transcription factor NFI, the regulatory mechanism of which is generally believed to require the assistance of a metal ion (30.Chen F. Shi X. Environ. Health Perspect. 2002; 110: 807-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our structural data support the hypothesis that the bound iron of Pirin may participate in this transcriptional regulation by enhancing and stabilizing the formation of the p50·Bcl-3·DNA complex. Metals have been implicated directly or indirectly in the NF-κB family of transcription factors that control expression of a number of early response genes associated with inflammatory responses, cell growth, cell cycle progression, and neoplastic transformation (30.Chen F. Shi X. Environ. Health Perspect. 2002; 110: 807-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, most metal-dependent transcription factors are DNA-binding proteins that bind to specific sequences when the metal binds to the protein. Pirin, on the other hand, appears to function differently and bind to the transcription factor·DNA complex. The His3Glu ligand environment and octahedral geometry of the metal-binding site in Pirin are well suited for the binding of heavy metal ions. The Fe(II) cofactors in non-heme iron proteins such as Pirin are labile, and therefore substitution of iron in Pirin by other metal ions offers a novel mechanism by which heavy metals can directly interfere with gene transcription. Potential Enzymatic Activity of Pirins—The Fe2+ binding site in Pirin closely resembles that found in germin, the archetypal cupin. Germin is a manganese-containing protein that has been shown to be an oxalate oxidase and superoxide dismutase (22.Anand R. Dorrestien P.C. Kinsland C. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7659-7669Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 31.Lane B.G. Dunwell J.M. Ray J.A. Schmitt M.R. Cuming A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12239-12242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that Pirin does not possess either superoxide dismutase or oxalate oxidase activity, but we cannot rule out oxidase activity with other substrates. Recently, a number of 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-dependent iron monooxygenases, including clavaminic acid synthase 1 (32.Zhang Z. Ren J. Stammers D.K. Baldwin J.E. Harlos K. Schofield C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), hypoxia-inducible factor (33.Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr, W.G. Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar, 34.Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. Kriegsheim A. Hebestreit H.F. Mukherji M. Schofield C.J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4489) Google Scholar), and factor-inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor, were suggested to be members of the cupin superfamily on the basis of sequence and structure homology (35.Hewitson K.S. McNeill L.A. Riordan M.V. Tian Y.M. Bullock A.N. Welford R.W. Elkins J.M. Oldham N.J. Bhattacharya S. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26351-26355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Pirin is structurally related to these enzymes, but 2-OG-dependent monooxygenases have a highly conserved HX(D/E)... H motif, with the two histidines and one aspartate or glutamate forming a facial triad, leaving three coordination sites on the octahedral Fe(II) center for the binding of 2-OG and oxygen. Because the metal binding site in Pirins has a highly conserved His3Glu set of ligands, with only two potentially vacant coordination sites on the Fe(II), Pirins are unlikely to be 2-OG-dependent monooxygenases. The other members of the cupin superfamily thought to contain iron are dioxygenases, and a phylogenetic analysis of cupins placed Pirins in the same clade as cysteine dioxygenases (2.Dunwell J.M. Culham A. Carter C.E. Sosa-Aguirre C.R. Goodenough P.W. Trends Biochem. Science. 2001; 26: 740-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Dioxygenases require electron transfer cofactor proteins, and the genes encoding the various proteins of a dioxygenase system are generally grouped together into an operon. Although no open reading frames encoding such cofactor proteins have been found on either the 5′ or 3′ sides of the human Pirin gene (1.Wendler W.M. Kremmer E. Forster R. Winnacker E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8482-8489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), this aspect warrants further investigation. Model of a Pirin·Bcl-3 Complex—The oncoprotein Bcl-3 is a distinctive member of the IκB family of NF-κB inhibitors and is located predominantly in the nucleus. It has the properties of a transcriptional co-activator and acts as a bridging factor between NF-κB/Rel and nuclear co-regulators. Pirin is known to be one of several binding partners that can associate with Bcl-3 (3.Dechend R. Hirano F. Lehmann K. Heissmeyer V. Ansieau S. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. Leutz A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) to form part of a larger quaternary complex on NF-κB DNA binding sites. Four binding partners of Bcl-3 have so far been identified, namely Pirin, Jab1, Bard1, and Tip60. There are no apparent shared sequence motifs in these four cofactors required for interaction with Bcl-3, and the only common properties between them is that they are nuclear proteins and associate with gene regulators. The structure of the Bcl-3 ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) is elongated and is comprised of seven ankyrin (ANK) repeats (36.Michel F. Soler-Lopez M. Petosa C. Cramer P. Siebenlist U. Muller C.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6180-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Its central ankyrin repeats are similar to those of IκBα, with the key difference that Bcl-3 has a seventh ankyrin repeat at the C terminus in place of the PEST region of IκBα. Mutagenesis studies of Bcl-3 indicated that all seven ankyrin repeats are required for binary interaction with Pirin, whereas interactions with Jab1 or Bard1 require only five repeats (3.Dechend R. Hirano F. Lehmann K. Heissmeyer V. Ansieau S. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. Leutz A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Pirin and Bcl-3 can also be sequestered into quaternary complexes with p50 and DNA, and Pirin is known to increase the DNA binding by Bcl-3·p50. As with Pirin, all seven ankyrin repeats are required for the Bcl-3·p50 interaction (3.Dechend R. Hirano F. Lehmann K. Heissmeyer V. Ansieau S. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. Leutz A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of the complex is not known, but Bcl-3 is able to recognize at least two proteins simultaneously (3.Dechend R. Hirano F. Lehmann K. Heissmeyer V. Ansieau S. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. Leutz A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Because the structures of IκBα/NF-κB (p65/p50 heterodimer) (37.Huxford T. Huang D.B. Malek S. Ghosh G. Cell. 1998; 95: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 38.Jacobs M.D. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 749-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar) complex and NF-κB p50 homodimer (39.Muller C.W. Rey F.A. Sodeoka M. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) are known, and to understand the interaction between Pirin, Bcl-3, and p50, we modeled the complex of these two proteins using protein-protein docking techniques (Fig. 4, A and B). A Bcl-3·(p50)2 complex was constructed using the structures of the IκBα·NF-κB complex and the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) of Bcl-3. The Bcl-3 ARD structure and the (p50)2 homodimer were superimposed onto the IκBα·NF-κB complex. Pirin was then docked to the Bcl-3·(p50)2 complex using the program FTDOCK (40.Moont G. Gabb H.A. Sternberg M.J.E. Proteins. 1999; 35: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The surface of Pirin has a large acidic patch on the N-terminal domain surface formed by residues 77-82, 97-103, and 124-128. We suggest that this acidic patch could interact with the large basic patch on ankyrin repeats 6 and 7 of Bcl-3. Additional contacts to ankyrin repeat 5 of Bcl-3 could be formed by residues 160-166 of Pirin. Notably, the previous observation that Pirin binding to Bcl-3 requires all seven repeats of the ARD was based on C-terminal ARD deletion (ΔARD6-7 or ΔARD5-7) mutants, therefore, ARD4-7 of Bcl-3 might be the only domain interacting with Pirin (3.Dechend R. Hirano F. Lehmann K. Heissmeyer V. Ansieau S. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. Leutz A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), which is consistent with our model. Further analysis involving N-terminal ARD deletion mutants should provide further insight into the Pirin-Bcl-3 recognition interactions. In our model of the complex, residues 265-284 of the C-terminal arm of Pirin could make contacts with one of the p50 molecules. One possibility is that Bcl-3 binding to the (p50)2 homodimer could induce conformational changes that lead to Pirin binding to p50, although gel retardation experiments showed that there is no direct binding between Pirin and p50 (3.Dechend R. Hirano F. Lehmann K. Heissmeyer V. Ansieau S. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. Leutz A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Although we emphasize that this model is only hypothetical, the extensive contacts formed by Pirin with Bcl-3 and p50 may explain why Pirin can act as a transcription cofactor and enhance the association of Bcl-3 with p50 homodimers. Bcl-3 has a strong preference for p50 and p52 homodimers (3.Dechend R. Hirano F. Lehmann K. Heissmeyer V. Ansieau S. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. Leutz A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and, under certain conditions, two molecules of Bcl-3 have been observed to bind to a single p50 or p52 homodimer (41.Bundy D.L. McKeithan T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33132-33139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The addition of a second Bcl-3 molecule in our model, related to the first Bcl-3 molecule using the pseudodyad symmetry of the p50 homodimer, shows that the two Bcl-3 molecules have highly complementary hydrophobic contacts in the ankyrin repeats 1 and 2 (Fig. 4, A and B). IκBα, on the other hand, binds preferentially to p50-p65 heterodimers, and it is clear that the C-terminal of p65, containing the nuclear localization signal, would sterically hinder the binding of a second IκBα molecule. Our model gives some clues as to why Bcl-3 preferentially binds p50 or p52 homodimers and how p50 or p52 homodimers interact with Bcl-3. Biological Implications—The structure of human Pirin represents the first crystal structure of the Pirin family and is an important step toward understanding the function of these proteins. Our work shows that human Pirin is a monomer with two cross-linked β-barrel domains. Pirin is confirmed to be a member of the cupin superfamily on the basis of primary sequence and structural similarity. The presence of a metal binding site in the N-terminal β-barrel of Pirin, which is highly conserved among Pirins, may be significant in its role in regulating NFI DNA replication and NF-κB transcription factor activity. Fe(II) was surprisingly found to be bound to Pirin and could impart enzymatic activity to the protein. Substitution of iron by other heavy metals also offers a direct mechanism for heavy metals to influence gene transcription. This novel pathway may be relevant in the toxicity and other effects of these metals. Finally, the structure of Pirin strongly suggests that a new role of iron in biology, namely regulating DNA replication and gene transcription at the level of the DNA complexes, should be added to the list of the many vital functions of this metal in living organisms.

https://openalex.org/W2002708941,"Hypoxia is one of the major signals that induces angiogenesis. Hypoxic conditions lead to reduced extracellular pH. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) binding to endothelial cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) increases at acidic pH (7.0-5.5). These interactions are dependent on heparan sulfate proteoglycans, but do not depend on the presence of VEGF receptors. Here we report that VEGF165 and VEGF121 binding to fibronectin also increased at acidic pH, and that these interactions are further enhanced by the addition of heparin. These results reveal that the accepted non-heparin-binding isoform of VEGF (VEGF121) is converted into a heparin-binding growth factor under acidic conditions. Interestingly, we did not observe increased binding of VEGF to collagen type I at acidic pH in the presence or absence of heparin, indicating that this effect is not a general property of all heparin-binding ECM proteins. The high level of VEGF binding at acidic pH was also rapidly reversed as demonstrated by increased rates of VEGF dissociation from fibronectin and fibronectin-heparin matrices as the pH was raised. The VEGF released from fibronectin retained its ability to stimulate the activation of extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 in endothelial cells. These results suggest that VEGF may be stored in the extracellular matrix via interactions with fibronectin and heparan sulfate in tissues that are in need of vascularization so that it can aid in directing the dynamic process of growth and migration of new blood vessels."
https://openalex.org/W2138828275,"Abcb11 encodes for the liver bile salt export pump, which is rate-limiting for hepatobiliary bile salt secretion. We employed transthyretin-Abcb11 and BAC-Abcb11 transgenes to develop mice overexpressing the bile salt export pump in the liver. The mice manifest increases in bile flow and biliary secretion of bile salts, phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol. Hepatic gene expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase and ileal expression of the apical sodium bile salt transporter are markedly reduced, whereas gene expression of targets of the nuclear bile salt receptor FXR (ileal lipid-binding protein, short heterodimer partner (SHP) is increased. Because these changes in gene expression are associated with an increased overall hydrophobicity of the bile salt pool and a 4-fold increase of the FXR ligand taurodeoxycholate, they reflect bile salt-mediated regulation of FXR and SHP target genes. Despite the increased biliary secretion of bile salts, fecal bile salt excretion is unchanged, suggestive of an enhanced enterohepatic cycling of bile salts. Abcb11 transgenic mice fed a lithogenic (high cholesterol/fat/cholic acid) diet display markedly reduced hepatic steatosis compared with wild-type controls. We conclude that mice overexpressing Abcb11 display an increase in biliary bile salt secretion and taurodeoxycholate content, which is associated with FXR/SHP-mediated changes in hepatic and ileal gene expression. Because these mice are resistant to hepatic lipid accumulation, regulation of Abcb11 may be important for the pathogenesis and treatment of steatohepatitis.

Because these mice are resistant to hepatic lipid accumulation, regulation of Abcb11 may be important for the pathogenesis and treatment of steatohepatitis. Bile formation and secretion are essential functions of the mammalian liver. The rate-limiting step in hepatobiliary bile salt secretion is the ATP-dependent canalicular secretion of bile salts (1.Carey M.C. Arias I. Boyer J.L. Fausto N. Jakoby W.B. Schachter D. Shafritz D.A.

Gene (Amst.). 2000; 241: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although this protein was demonstrated to represent the major transport protein responsible for hepatobiliary secretion of bile salts (3.Gerloff T. Stieger B. Hagenbuch B. Madon J. Landmann L. Roth J. Hofmann A.F. Meier P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10046-10050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), its specific roles in regulating the enterohepatic circulation and hepatobiliary lipid metabolism remain poorly understood. Defects in the human ABCB11 gene are responsible for progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2, a chronic cholestatic disorder that leads to liver cirrhosis in early childhood (5.Strautnieks S.S. Bull L.N. Knisely A.S. Kocoshis S.A. Dahl N. Arnell H. Sokal E. Dahan K. Childs S. Ling V. Tanner M.S. Kagalwalla A.F. Nemeth A. Pawlowska J. Baker A. Mieli-Vergani G. Freimer N.B. Gardiner R.M. Thompson R.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). However, a recently described Abcb11-null mouse manifests a much less cholestatic phenotype compared with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 patients (6.Wang R. Salem M. Yousef I.M. Tuchweber B. Lam P. Childs S.J. Helgason C.D. Ackerley C. Phillips M.J. Ling V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2011-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Although prior studies have evaluated and characterized the kinetics of ABCB11 utilizing in vitro systems or by administering cholestatic stimuli, the effects of increased function on hepatobiliary lipid metabolism and secretion have not been explored. The hepatobiliary secretion of bile salts is the major stimulus for bile formation. In addition, bile salts transcriptionally regulate many liver-specific genes, including Cyp7a1, which encodes for cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for the “classic” or neutral bile salt synthetic pathway (7.Shefer S. Hauser S. Bekersky I. Mosbach E.H. J. Lipid Res. 1970; 11: 404-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Cyp7a1 expression is down-regulated in vitro, when hepatocytes are cultured in the presence of bile salts, or in vivo, when the bile salt pool is expanded by bile salt feeding (8.Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Similarly, expression of the ileal apical sodium bile salt transporter (ASBT) is also transcriptionally regulated by bile salts (9.Chen F. Ma L. Dawson P.A. Sinal C.J. Sehayek E. Gonzalez F.J. Breslow J. Ananthanarayanan M. Shneider B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19909-19916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These effects have been demonstrated by bile salt feeding or infusing animals, and considerable evidence has demonstrated that they occur due to increases in the bile salt ligands of the nuclear bile salt receptor FXR, in particular chenodeoxycholic acid and deoxycholic acid, as well as their glyco- and tauroconjugates (10.Wang H. Chen J. Hollister K. Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). However, exploration of physiologic mechanisms responsible for the regulation of many of these genes has been limited, in part, due to the lack of animal models in which the bile salt pool and content, as well as enterohepatic cycling of bile salts, have been manipulated without exogenous bile salt administration or sequestration. In the current study, we have employed two distinct transgenes in order to develop transgenic mice that functionally overexpress Abcb11 in the liver. Enhanced canalicular expression of Abcb11 resulted in a marked increase of both bile flow and biliary lipid secretion. The increased bile salt secretion was not accompanied by increased fecal bile salt excretion but was associated with increases in SHP expression, with the resultant decreases in expression of Cyp7a1 and Asbt. Unfortunately, when placed on a lithogenic (high cholesterol/fat/cholic acid) diet for 4–8 weeks, mice overexpressing Abcb11 mice in a 129S1/SvImJ background do not manifest a significant difference in gallstone susceptibility. However, Abcb11 overexpressing mice displayed a profound resistance to the development of hepatic steatosis. These phenotypes will be important in enhancing our understanding of the pathophysiologic role of Abcb11 in regulating gene expression throughout the enterohepatic circulation, with resultant changes in hepatobiliary lipid metabolism and secretion. Vector Constructs and Generation of Transgenic Mice—For transthyretin (TTR)-Abcb11 transgenic mice, a TTR promoter-Abcb11 construct was utilized for the development of TTR-Abcb11 transgenic mice. The construct consists of –3 kb of the TTR promoter region with the first and second exons (including the first intron) fused to the SV40 3′-UT and the polyadenylation tail (vector kindly provided by Dr. Robert Costa, University of Illinois, Chicago). The full-length Abcb11 coding region was inserted at the StuI site in the second TTR exon. Previous studies (4.Green R.M. Hoda F. Ward K.L. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 241: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the Abcb11 cDNA encodes for a functional bile salt transporter. Transgenic mice were generated using standard microinjection techniques at the University of Illinois Transgenic Facility (Chicago). Founder lines were screened for the presence of the transgene by performing PCR analysis and Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA extracted from mouse tails using DNeasy Tissue Kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). PCR was performed using primer pairs encoding for the SV40 region with sense (5′-AAAGTCCTGGATGCTGTCCGAG-3′) and antisense (5′-CAGACATGATAAGATACATTGATG-3′) primers, and Southern blotting was performed using DraI-digested genomic DNA. The correct orientation of the Abcb11 gene was also confirmed using PCR primers corresponding to the coding region and the SV40 3′ primer and by nucleotide sequencing. Initial genomic screening revealed 5 founder lines containing the transgene construct. All TTR-Abcb11 transgenic mice were derived in an FVB/NJ background, with all control experiments performed on littermate mice of the same background strain. Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) Transgenic Mice—Fourteen BACs containing the whole Abcb11 gene were identified by screening a genomic BAC library (RPCI-23) from the gallstone-susceptible inbred mouse strain C57BL/6J (BACPAC Resources, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY). As DNA probes, we used 5′ and 3′ fragments of the gene, radioactively labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Random Primer Labeling System, Invitrogen). The hybridization of membranes was carried out at 65 °C overnight in Church buffer (1 m NaHPO4 (pH 7.2), 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 m EDTA, 20% SDS). Small amounts of BAC DNA were isolated by alkaline lysis; preparative BAC DNA isolation was carried out using the Nucleobond AX kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). Isolated BAC DNA was digested with NotI and size-fractionated on a 1% agarose gel by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (CHEF-DR III system, Bio-Rad). For BAC sequencing, 800–1000 ng of BAC DNA were incubated for 30 min at 60 °C, denatured at 95 °C for 5 min with 12 μl of Big Dye Terminator Reaction Mix (Applera, Norwalk, CT) and 0.5 μm primer, and amplified for 100 cycles as follows: 95 °C/30 s, 50 °C/20 s, 60 °C/4 min. Products were purified on Centrisep columns (Emp Biotech, Berlin, Germany) and separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 310 automated sequencer (Applera). The smallest BAC clones (RP23–291P1) containing the complete Abcb11 gene was chosen for transgenesis and submitted to the Trans-NIH BAC Sequencing Program (www.nih.gov/science/models/bacsequencing/) for full sequencing. The 182-kb insert contains 33 kb of flanking sequence at the 5′ end, 44 kb of flanking sequence at the 3′ end of Abcb11, and the complete gene encoding the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic related protein (G6pc-rs) 5′ of Abcb11, a gene of unknown function expressed primarily in the pancreas (11.Arden S.D. Zahn T. Steegers S. Webb S. Bergman B. O'Brien R.M. Hutton J.C. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The purified BAC DNA was dissolved in microinjection buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 30 μm spermine, 70 μm spermidine, 100 mm NaCl) at a concentration of about 2–4 ng/μl and microinjected into pronuclei of fertilized eggs from gallstone-resistant strains AKR/J, CBA/J, and 129S1/SvImJ (Mouse Phenome Data Base, www.jax.org/phenome/). Genomic DNA was extracted from tail tips, as described above. Founder mice were screened for transgene integration by PCR amplification using T7 and SP6 primers in combination with oligonucleotides specific for the BAC insert (5′-CTGGTGTCACGGTCCATCTTG-3′ and 5′-CCAATTCAGACCAGCTGAGAGC-3′, respectively), and the results were confirmed by Southern blotting. Two of 72 offspring from 129S1/SvImJ contained at least one copy of the transgene, with transgene copy number measured by comparing band intensities in Southern blot analysis to those of standard amounts of BAC DNA. Two lines of Abcb11-BAC transgenic mice (F46, official name 129S1/SvImJ-Tg(RP23–291P1)1flp and F-60, 129S1/SvImJ-Tg(RP23–291P1)2flp) were established by mating transgenic founder mice to 129S1/SvImJ inbred mice. Mouse Husbandry and Diets—All mice were housed in a temperature-controlled room (22 °C) with 12-h light/12-h dark cycling and fed Purina or Altromin chow, which contains <0.02% (w/w) cholesterol, as determined by HPLC (12.Lammert F. Wang D.Q.-H. Paigen B. Carey M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2080-2090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 6–8 weeks of age, the mice were switched to a lithogenic diet containing 1.25% cholesterol, 0.5% cholic acid, and 15% dairy fat (13.Wang D.Q.-H. Paigen B. Carey M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1395-1411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, male mice were used for the phenotypic characterization. Protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees, and euthanasia was consistent with recommendations of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Biliary Lipid Analysis—Biliary lipid secretion was determined following gallbladder puncture and collection of bile. PE-10 tubing was inserted into the gallbladder, and the bile aspirate was removed and analyzed as gallbladder bile. For analysis of hepatic bile, the gallbladder was cannulated with PE-10 tubing and secured with a silk suture. The common bile duct was ligated, and bile collection was performed gravimetrically. The initial 15 min of biliary secretion that contained concentrated gallbladder bile were not used for analysis, and bile collection continued for up to 1 h and was constant over this period. All procedures were performed using xylazine and ketamine anesthesia. The mice had free access to food and water prior to all experiments, and body temperature was maintained within 0.25 °C throughout the experiment. The biliary concentrations of cholesterol, phospholipids, and bile salts were measured in gallbladder biles from transgenic and wild-type animals (n = 5) (12.Lammert F. Wang D.Q.-H. Paigen B. Carey M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2080-2090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Wang D.Q.-H. Paigen B. Carey M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1395-1411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular bile salt species were determined by HPLC (13.Wang D.Q.-H. Paigen B. Carey M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1395-1411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bile salt hydrophobicity index was calculated according to Heuman (14.Heuman D.M. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 719-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrations and molecular species of phosphatidylcholine in bile were quantified by electrospray injection mass spectrometry, using 15:0–15:0 phosphatidylcholine as an internal standard (15.Koivusalo M. Haimi P. Heikinheimo L. Kostiainen R. Somerharju P. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 663-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bile salt pool sizes were determined following bile salt extraction of liver, small intestine, and gallbladder. Tracer amounts of [3H]taurocholate or glycocholate were used as internal standards. Bile salts were extracted by incubation in 50 ml of methanol for 24 h at 60 °C. Following extraction, 10-ml aliquots were dried down and resuspended in 1 ml of methanol. The suspension was centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was filtered through PVDE acrodisc filters. The filtrate was dried down, resuspended in methanol/water (3:1, v/v), and recentrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was analyzed by both HPLC using glycocholate as an internal standard or a spectrophotometric assay employing the 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase method (Sigma) with [3H]taurocholate as internal standard. Parallel experiments were performed with transgenic and wild-type mice at all times. Stool fecal collections were performed for 24 h utilizing metabolic cages to prevent coprophagy. The stool was dried in vacuo and pulverized, and 0.2-g samples of dry feces were added to 4 ml of t-butanol/H2O (1:1, v/v) and mixed at 37 °C for 15 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was assayed enzymatically for total bile salt content as described above. Biliary and Hepatic Phenotypes—After feeding the lithogenic diet for up to 8 weeks, mice were fasted for 4 h and anesthetized, and cholecystectomy was performed after euthanasia with isoflurane and ligation of the cystic duct. Gallbladder volumes were determined gravimetrically, assuming a bile density of 1 g/ml. Fresh gallbladder biles were examined by polarizing light microscopy. Liquid crystals, solid crystals, and stones were scored semi-quantitatively according to Wang et al. (13.Wang D.Q.-H. Paigen B. Carey M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1395-1411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gallstone composition was determined by infrared spectroscopy (16.Trotman B.W. Morris III, T.A. Sanchez H.M. Soloway R.D. Ostrow J.D. Gastroenterology. 1977; 72: 495-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Liver and ileum were excised after euthanasia and either utilized immediately or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –70 °C. Hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride contents were obtained employing spectrophotometric kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Histological analysis was performed using hematoxylin and eosin and Oil Red O staining. RNA Expression Analysis—For all expression analyses, tissues were harvested from mice fasted for 4 h, starting between 8 and 9 am. Northern blotting was performed using liver or ileum RNA from individual mice as described previously (4.Green R.M. Hoda F. Ward K.L. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 241: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 17.Fickert P. Zollner G. Fuchsbichler A. Stumptner C. Pojer C. Zenz R. Lammert F. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Zatloukal K. Denk H. Trauner M. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 170-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 μg of total RNA were isolated using phenol/chloroform extraction (Biotecx, Houston, TX), electrophoresed on a 1% denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes for Abcb11, Abcb4, Abcg5, Abcg8, Cyp7a1, Cyp27a1, ASBT (Slc10a2), ILBP (Fabp6), actin and ubiquitin at 42 °C. cDNA probes for Abcg5/Abcg8 and Cyp7a1 were kindly provided by Dr. Helen Hobbs and Dr. David Russell, respectively (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The other probes were cloned from the corresponding cDNAs after RT-PCR or derived from EST clones with >95% homology to the previously identified genes. After stringent washing, membranes were exposed to either photographic film (Eastman Kodak Co.) or a phosphor screen, and densitometry was performed using the Fluor S Multiimager CCD camera system and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Quantitative RT-PCR to examine hepatic RNA expression of Abcb11, Cyp7a1, SHP (Nr0b2), and the scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI, Scarb1) was performed utilizing the GeneAmp 5700 Sequence Detection System (Applera, Norwalk, CT). Data were normalized using actin primers. Preliminary experiments confirmed that actin RNA was constitutively expressed in the mouse strains under the utilized conditions. Primer sequences were Cyp7a1, forward 5′-AGCAACTAAACAACCTGCCAGTACTA-3′ and reverse 5′-GTCCGGATATTCAAGGATGCA-3′; SHP, forward 5′-GGAGGCCTTGGATGTCCTAG-3′ and reverse 5′-AGCCTCCTGTTGCAGGTGTG-3′; and SR-BI, forward 5′-TTTCAGCAGGATCCATCTGGTGGA-3′ and reverse 5′-AGTTCATGGGGATCCCAGTGAC-3′, and actin forward 5′-TACAGCTTCACCACCACAGC-3′ and reverse AAGGAAGGCTGGAAAAGAGC-3′. Immunoblot Analysis—Canalicular liver membranes (cLPM), which were 20-fold enriched in canalicular domain markers, were prepared as described previously (4.Green R.M. Hoda F. Ward K.L. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 241: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford Kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels and subjected to electrophoresis (17.Fickert P. Zollner G. Fuchsbichler A. Stumptner C. Pojer C. Zenz R. Lammert F. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Zatloukal K. Denk H. Trauner M. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 170-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Equal protein loading was confirmed by Coomassie staining of gels and Ponceau S staining of membranes after transfer. After electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), the blots were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween and 10% bovine serum albumin for 30 min and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a polyclonal antiserum directed against the carboxyl terminus of mouse BSEP (dilution 1:2500) (4.Green R.M. Hoda F. Ward K.L. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 241: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 17.Fickert P. Zollner G. Fuchsbichler A. Stumptner C. Pojer C. Zenz R. Lammert F. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Zatloukal K. Denk H. Trauner M. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 170-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were detected using horseradish-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 fragments (dilution 1:1,000; Dako, Glastrup, Denmark) according to the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry was performed using the CCD camera system described above. Statistical Analysis—All data are reported as the mean ± S.E., unless otherwise noted. The differences between the mean values were tested for statistical significance by the two-tailed Student's t test. The GenBank™ accession number for the BAC clone RP23-291P1 is AC084429. The Mouse Genome Database accession numbers for Abcb11-BAC transgenic mice are MGI:2384356 and MGI:2386568. Generation of Abcb11 Transgenic Mice—Five founder lines of transgenic mice were obtained containing the TTR-Abcb11 transgene in an FVB/NJ background. The F51 founder line had the highest level of expression and was utilized for the majority of the experiments characterizing the phenotype. In addition, the F21 founder line was analyzed and demonstrated similar phenotype effects, excluding the possibility that phenotypic expression was due to a gene insertional effect. Fig. 1A demonstrates the increased expression of the Abcb11 gene in the livers of the TTR-Abcb11 transgenic mice. Gene expression is increased 3-fold compared with littermate controls. Transgenic mice containing a BAC encompassing the Abcb11 gene under the control of its own regulatory sequences were generated in a 129S1/SvImJ background. Fig. 1B displays a Southern blot analysis demonstrating that both Abcb11-BAC transgenic lines F46 and F60 possess one to two additional intact copies of the Abcb11 gene in comparison to wild-type controls and gene expression is also ∼2-fold higher in the transgenic progeny (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis was performed using purified cLPM to confirm that the transgene results in ABCB11 protein overexpression in the liver. Fig. 1C shows that similar to Abcb11 mRNA levels, hepatic canalicular membrane expression of ABCB11 protein is increased to a comparable degree. These findings indicate that the transgenes overexpress and target the ABCB11 protein to the liver canalicular membrane. All transgenic mice appeared healthy and grossly normal at base line. They exhibited a normal reproductive rate and gender distribution. In addition, the mice were born in a normal Mendelian distribution, excluding a lethal developmental abnormality. Both the TTR-Abcb11 and Abcb11-BAC transgenic mice had food consumption identical to their background strain controls. The transgenic mice also did not demonstrate any difference in longevity with observation of 1 year. Expression of Bile Salt and Cholesterol Metabolic and Transporter Genes—We initially determined the hepatic expression of selected bile salt and cholesterol metabolic and transporter genes. Fig. 2 displays that there is a decreased gene expression of hepatic Cyp7a1 in both TTR-Abcb11 and Abcb11-BAC transgenic mice fed chow. Northern blotting with densitometry analysis indicates that Cyp7a1 expression is 35 ± 14% of wild-type controls. This enzyme initiates and is likely rate-limiting for the classic (also known as neutral) pathway of hepatic bile salt synthesis and for the conversion of cholesterol into bile salts (8.Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is no diminished expression of Cyp27a1, the gene that encodes a key enzyme of the alternative pathway in bile salt synthesis via the acidic pathway. Fig. 3 describes quantitative RT-PCR that was utilized to further confirm the decreased expression of Cyp7a1 in Abcb11 transgenic mice.

Transgenic and wild-type mice display similar hepatic mRNA levels of Abcb4 (Fig. 2B) and Abcg5/Abcg8 (Fig. 2C), which encode for membrane proteins reported to be involved in the hepatobiliary secretion of the major biliary phospholipid (phosphatidylcholine) and cholesterol. Fig. 2C also illustrates that in wild-type and transgenic mice, a lithogenic (high cholesterol/fat/cholic acid) diet increases the hepatic expression levels of the Abcg5/Abcg8 genes 5.5- and 4.4-fold, respectively (p < 0.01). These data are consistent with previous studies demonstrating Abcg5/Abcg8 induction by cholesterol via the nuclear hormone receptor LXRα (20.Yu L. Li-Hawkins J. Hammer R.E. Berge K.E. Horton J.D.

Fig. 3D illustrates that the increase (2.4-fold) of SR-BI expression in Abcb11 transgenic mice is 60% greater than the increase of SR-BI expression in wild-type mice (p < 0.01). These data are also consistent with previous data reporting a significant hepatic induction of the SR-BI receptor in response to the lithogenic diet (22.Fuchs M. Ivandic B. Muller O. Schalla C.

In contrast, the expression levels of Abcb11 (Fig. 2C) and Abcb4 are not induced by the lithogenic diet. In order to confirm the functional consequence of overexpressing Abcb11, we assayed bile flow by collecting hepatic bile from 8- to 10-week-old mice. Table I describes the biliary lipid secretion rates in TTR-Abcb11 transgenic mice. Bile flow and bile salt secretion are increased by 48 and 85%, respectively, compared with control mice (p < 0.01). The bile salt independent component of bile flow is similar in TTR-Abcb11 transgenic mice and control mice of the identical background strain. These data indicate that the choleretic effect observed in the TTR-Abcb11 transgenic mice is due to the hypersecretion of bile"

It has been reported to form complexes with cyclin-dependent kinase 4, retinoblastoma protein, the S6b ATPase subunit of the 19 S regulator of the 26 S proteasome, and Mdm2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in p53 degradation. It is the first protein described to bind both to the 26 S proteasome and to proteins in other complexes containing cyclin-dependent kinase(s) and p53 ubiquitylating activities, thus providing a mechanism for delivering cell cycle regulating machinery and ubiquitylated substrates to the proteasome for degradation. Gankyrin contains a 33-residue motif known as the ankyrin repeat that occurs five and a half to six times in the sequence. As a step toward understanding gankyrin interactions with its protein partners we have determined its three-dimensional crystal structure to 2.0-Å resolution. It reveals that the entire 226-residue gankyrin polypeptide folds into seven ankyrin repeat elements. The ankyrin repeats, consisting of an antiparallel β-hairpin followed by a perpendicularly oriented helix-loop-helix, pack side-by-side, creating an extended curved structure with a groove running across the long concave surface. Comparison with the structures of other ankyrin repeat proteins suggests that interactions with partner proteins are mediated by residues situated on this concave surface.

Gankyrin is overexpressed in human hepatocellular carcinomas, its name deriving from this observation (gann means cancer in Japanese) and the presence of five and a half to six ankyrin repeats in its sequence (1.Higasgituji H.

Wu M.C. World J. Gastroenterol. 2002; 8: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The gankyrin gene is one of the first genes to be overexpressed in a rodent model of hepato-carcinogenesis (3.Park T.J. Kim H.S. Byun K.H. Jang J.J. Lee Y.S. Lim I.K. Mol. Carcinog. 2001; 30: 138-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Its overproduction leads to transformation of cultured NIH-3T3 cells and induces tumor formation in nude mice. Gankyrin overexpression correlates with hyperphosphorylation and degradation of the retinoblastoma protein, Rb, a tumor suppressor. Gankyrin has been shown to bind to the cyclin D-dependent kinase cyclin-dependent kinase 4, a cell cycle regulator, one of whose substrates is Rb (4.Dawson S.D. Apcher S. Mee M. Higashitsuji H.

Phosphorylation of Rb is an important step in enabling progression through the cell cycle, and thus, the activities of the relevant kinases are carefully controlled. Binding of gankyrin to CDK4 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; INK, CDK inhibitor; ANK, ankyrin repeat; GABPα, growth-associated binding protein α. 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; INK, CDK inhibitor; ANK, ankyrin repeat; GABPα, growth-associated binding protein α. prevents the latter from binding to p16INK4 (5.Li J. Tsai M-D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3977-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). p16INK4 is a member of the INK4 family of proteins, which inhibit CDKs 4 and 6 and, thus, themselves have tumor suppressor functions. As a p16INK4 antagonist, gankyrin functions as a promoter of cell cycle progression. Gankyrin has also been shown in yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens and biochemically to form a complex with the human S6b ATPase subunit of the 19 S regulatory complex of the 26 S proteasome. S6b is one of six non-redundant ATPases, all belonging to the AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) superfamily (6.Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Among ATP-dependent proteases, these hexameric ATPase complexes are associated with substrate unfolding and translocation into an enclosed chamber where proteolysis occurs. In the case of the 26 S proteasome, degradation takes place in the 20 S core. The only other protein shown to interact with gankyrin in a Y2H screen and biochemically is a melanoma antigen MAGE-A4. This interaction suppresses the oncogenic activity of gankyrin (7.Nagao T. Higashitsuji H. Nonoguchi K. Sakurai T. Dawson S. Mayer R.J. Itoh K. Fujita J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10668-10674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that gankyrin is a protein cofactor that controls the p53 ubiquitylation activity of Mdm2 in a p300-independent manner. 2H. Higashitsuji, H. Higashitsuji, K. Itoh, T. Nagao, T. Sakurai, S. Dawson, R. J. Mayer, and J. Fujita, manuscript in preparation. 2H. Higashitsuji, H. Higashitsuji, K. Itoh, T. Nagao, T. Sakurai, S. Dawson, R. J. Mayer, and J. Fujita, manuscript in preparation. Gankyrin is the first protein described to bind both to the 26 S proteasome and to proteins in other complexes containing a cyclin-dependent kinase(s) and p53 ubiquitylating activities. It, therefore, provides a mechanism to directly bring cell cycle regulating machinery and ubiquitylated substrates to the proteasome for substrate degradation. This coupled with the increasing evidence for the role of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway in DNA repair (9.Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldevan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 12: 135-141Crossref Scopus (1734) Google Scholar) and transcription (10.Muratani M. Tansey W.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) indicates the need to solve the structure of gankyrin to understand its functions in distinct complexes involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis. As a step toward understanding the interactions of gankyrin with its partner proteins and its role in cellular transformation, we have determined the crystal structure of gankyrin at 2.0-Å resolution. Structure Determination—Gankyrin was expressed as a thrombin cleavable His6-tagged form from a pET28a plasmid derivative and purified by nickel chelation chromatography. Thrombin digestion produces a polypeptide with 3 N-terminal residues, GSH, attached to the 226 residues of gankyrin. Native gel analysis revealed a single band or multiple bands according to whether dithiothreitol (5 mm) was present, prompting us to treat the protein with iodoacetic acid to carboxymethylate exposed cysteines. After passage of iodoacetic acid-modified gankyrin through a Superdex 75 16/60 column the protein appeared homogenous and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry suggested that two of the five cysteines had been acetylated. The resulting protein was crystallized from polyethylene glycol 5000 monomethyl ether (11.Krzywda S. Brzozowski A.M. Al-Safty R. Welchman R. Mee M. Dawson S. Fujita J. Higashitsuji H. Mayer R.J.

Open table in a new tab The structure was solved by molecular replacement in the program AMoRe (12.Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar) using as the search model a consensus ankyrin repeat protein, E3.5 (PDB entry 1mj0), derived from a combinatorial library with a theoretical complexity of 3.8 × 1023 molecules, each consisting of a fixed ankyrin repeat framework but otherwise randomized sequence (13.Kohl A.

E3.5 and gankyrin have 31.4% sequence identity. The molecular replacement solution was very clear, as evidenced by the correlation coefficient of 41.6% and the Rfactor of 49.7% of the correct solution, which stood out clearly from the values for the next best solution of 31.4 and 56.0% respectively. The initial electron density maps were of excellent quality, allowing 75% of the model to be built interactively in QUANTA (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). The model was completed by one round of automatic model building in ArpWarp (14.Perrakis A. Morris R.J. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar) and manual water building in QUANTA. The REFMAC (15.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13854) Google Scholar)-refined model contains residues 4-226 of gankyrin and 58 water molecules (Table I) and is deposited in the PDB with the accession code 1U0H. Overall Fold—The crystal structure of gankyrin was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of a consensus ankyrin repeat protein, E3.5, as a search model (13.Kohl A. Binz K.K. Forrer P. Stumpp M.T. Pluckthun A. Grutter M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). It is interesting that the structure of an artificial protein with no function provided the clearest solution to the structure of an oncoprotein that functions at the heart of the biochemistry of the cell. The refined structure consists of residues 4-226. There is no electron density associated with residues 1-3 (and 3 residues derived form the tag), and it is assumed these residues are disordered. Gankyrin contains 14 α-helices arranged in seven pairs and separated from one another by six β-hairpins as shown in Fig. 1, A-D. The repetitive character of the structure is clearly apparent. The five clear-cut ankyrin repeat sequences ANK1-ANK5 (Fig. 1E) each adopt the classical ankyrin repeat fold, justifying the naming of the protein. Each consists of two anti-parallel α-helices and a perpendicularly oriented short β-hairpin. Pairs of adjacent ankyrin repeat elements line up side-by-side so that their α-helices form a 4-helix bundle and their β-hairpins extend into anti-parallel β-sheet. The flanking sequences at the N and C termini also adopt ankyrin repeat structures. Residues 202-226 form a β-hairpin followed by a helix-loop-helix, although the first of the two helices is somewhat abbreviated (Fig. 1, C and D). These elements of structure continue the regular packing arrangement and constitute ANK6 even though the sequence deviates significantly from the ankyrin repeat consensus. Residues 4-36 clearly add a seventh structural repeat element, which we will call ANK0. They fold to form a helix-loop-helix followed by a 310 helix-like turn leading into ANK1. Thus, at the structural level, the ankyrin repeat pervades the molecule in its entirety. The peripheral ANK elements use only one of their lateral faces to pack with their ANK neighbors; the opposite face is exposed and, therefore, able to tolerate sequence variation. Overall the structure has a shape resembling a breaking wave or cupped hand. In the latter context, there is a noticeable curvature across the palm so that the surface created by the β-hairpins and the first of the ANK α-helices is concave, whereas that formed by the second of the ANK helices is convex. This type of curvature has been observed in other ankyrin repeat structures. The Ankyrins Repeats of Gankyrin—The ankyrin repeats in gankyrin are aligned against a consensus ANK sequence and the secondary structure assignments in Fig. 1E. Asp1 of the consensus is conserved in four of the ankyrin repeats of gankyrin; it was replaced by Asn in two of the others. Asp1/Asn1 sits below the β-turn with its carboxylate/amide C=O forming hydrogen bonds with the main chain amide N—H of residues 2 and 4. The other carboxylate oxygen/amide NH2 forms one or more hydrogen bonds to side chains of various types (Ser, Arg, Trp, Tyr, Asn) at position 10 of its own ANK repeat (ANKn) or at position 5 of the preceding ANK motif (ANKn-1) or, in one case, to a water molecule. The Thr6-Pro7-Leu8-His9-Leu10-Ala11 sequence is fully conserved in ANK5 and recognizable in all but ANK0. This motif spans the beginning of the first α-helix (α1) and is largely buried. The side chain of Thr6/Ser6 forms a hydrogen bond with Nδ of His9, whose Nϵ—H forms a hydrogen bond to a main chain carbonyl of ANKnn+1. The Pro7/Ala7 residue at the start of α1 contributes to the hydrophobic packing interaction with α2 of ANKn as well as with α1 of ANKn-1. The side chains of the helical residues Leu8/Met8 and, to a lesser extent Ala11 are at the heart of the local four helix bundle formed by ANKn and ANKn+1. The position 10 side chain is exposed on the surface of the molecule, and this residue is highly variable among the ankyrin repeats of gankyrin, appearing as the consensus Leu only in ANK5; elsewhere it is Trp, Ile, Tyr, Arg, and Val. Gly15 appears in the short loop connecting the two ANK helices, where it is preferred presumably because of its flexibility. Residues 19 and 20 at the start of α2 are Val in the consensus ankyrin repeat, although in gankyrin the residues at these positions are often other hydrophobic residues and occasionally polar residues. The side chains project into the protein core so that the residue 19 side chain interacts with the residue 20 side chain of ANKn-1 and the residue 20 side chain interacts with that of residue 19 in ANKn+1 so that as a set these residues form a hydrophobic continuum across the molecule. The Glu19 of ANK5 is oriented with its carboxylate exposed on the bottom face of the molecule so that its aliphatic portion contributes to the apolar core. Otherwise the requirement for apolar residues is relaxed only at Glu19 and Lys20 of the first and the last ANK repeats, respectively, which do not participate in packing with ANK neighbors and instead are exposed on the flanks of the molecule. Residues 22, 23, and 24 are each Leu in the ankyrin repeat consensus, and in gankyrin there is absolute conservation of hydrophobic character in the internal ANKs 1-5. The central Leu/Val side chains are at the protein core, whereas the adjacent hydrophobic residues are laterally oriented and form interactions with the α2 helices of adjacent ANK repeats. Again, there is no requirement for hydrophobic residues at Glu22 and Ser23 of ANK0 and Glu24 of ANK6 as the packing constraints disappear in the absence of a second flanking ANK element. The Gly27-Ala28-Asp29-Val30-Asn31-Ala32 segment connects α2 to the β-hairpin, the polypeptide following a remarkably similar course in all of the ankyrin repeats of gankyrin (Fig. 1, B-D). The Gly27 residue is present in four of the ANKs and replaced in the two other instances by lysines whose side chains project from the back face of the molecule. The Ala28 side chain points toward the center of the molecule to contribute to the hydrophobic core; a Val substitution in ANK1 is easily accommodated, whereas the Ser side chain at this position in ANK0 is exposed on the side of the molecule. The Asp29 consensus residue does not appear in gankyrin at all, although polar residues often take its place at this exposed position on the top surface of the molecule. The main chain twists at this point so that the side chain of ANK residues 28-30 generally lie across the top face of the molecule, and these positions show only moderate obedience to the consensus. ANK0 contains an extra residue in this region. Implications for Interactions with Partner Proteins—It is not possible on the basis of the crystal structure of gankyrin to assert how this protein recognizes its protein partners. Analysis of the structures of ankyrin repeat protein complexes shows some variety in the extent and mode of interactions that mediate partner recognition (Fig. 2; Ref. 16.Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In the p53·53BP2 complex the ankyrin repeat domain of 53BP2 has only a minor role in binding to p53, with the β-hairpin of the last of the four ankyrin repeats, ANK4, contacting p53 (Fig. 2A). The principal protein-protein interactions here are mediated by the downstream SH3 domain of 53BP2 (17.Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In GABPα, a transcription factor of the Ets domain family, interactions with the accessory factor GABPβ are mediated by the residues on the tips of four consecutive β-hairpin fingers and by residues on the exposed face of the α-helices in the ankyrin groove; in both cases these represent regions where sequence is not conserved in the ANK motif (Fig. 2B; Ref. 18.Batchelor A.H. Piper D.E. de la Brousse F.C. McKnight S.L. Wolberger C. Science. 1998; 279: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). More extensive regions of the ankyrin repeat element are employed in p16INK4a binding to CDK6 (Fig. 2C; Ref. 19.Russo A.A. Tong L. Lee J-O. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). As for GABPα·GABPβ, the helical face of the ankyrin groove for three of the repeats together with the β-hairpins clamp the N-terminal lobe of CDK6. In this case the connecting loops between the helical pairs in each ankyrin repeat element extend the contact surface with the target protein. The most extensive interface so far described for an ankyrin repeat protein is in the complex between IκBα and NFκB (Fig. 2D; Refs. 20.Huxford T. Huang D.B. Malek S. Ghosh G. Cell. 1998; 95: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar and 21.Jacobs M.D. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 749-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Here all six ankyrin repeat elements of IκBα make a variety of contacts to the nuclear localization signal, dimerization interface, and DNA binding domain of NFκB. These involve extensive surfaces of the ankyrin groove including α1 and the β-hairpins of the majority of IκBα ANKs, with additional contacts involving the exposed lateral face of ANK1. The ankyrin groove is, therefore, the most likely surface to mediate interactions with gankyrin partner proteins. As already indicated this surface is composed of residues from the α1 helices and the β-hairpins. It is decorated with the side chains of residues, which lie largely outside the consensus motifs, in particular those at ANK positions 2, 3, 5, 10, 13, and 14 (Fig. 1, E and F). Examination of a calculated electrostatic surface for gankyrin reveals a single remarkable feature, a patch of negative electrostatic potential on and beneath the β-hairpin rim of ANKs 5 and 6 (Fig. 3). This surface may interact with a complementary surface with positive potential on gankyrin target protein(s). GST pull-down, immunoprecipitation, and yeast two-hybrid assays have been performed on a series of deletion mutants of gankyrin to define regions of the structure required for interactions with partner proteins (4.Dawson S.D.

Higashitsuji, H. Higashitsuji, K. Itoh, T. Nagao, T. Sakurai, S. Dawson, R. J. Mayer, and J. Fujita, manuscript in preparation. These experiments have shown full-length gankyrin is required for interactions with Rb, Mdm2, S6b, and MAGE-A4. This may be because the interaction surface on gankyrin spans the full length of the molecule. Alternatively, deletion of the N-terminal extension or of one or more ankyrin repeats may expose otherwise buried non-polar surfaces, decreasing the stability of the folded molecule. Arguing against this is the observation that truncated gankyrin proteins containing only the first three and four ANKs retain CDK4 binding activity, comparable with the intact protein (5.Li J. Tsai M-D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3977-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these CDK4 binding deletions lack the LXCXE element discussed below. It has been proposed that residues Leu178-X-Cys180-X-Glu182 of gankyrin constitute a motif used to mediate interactions with the retinoblastoma protein, Rb (1.Higasgituji H. Itoh K. Nagao T. Dawson S.D. Nonoguchi K. Kido T. Mayer R.J. Arii S. Fujita J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 5.Li J. Tsai M-D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3977-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the pocket domain of Rb bound to a synthetic peptide (DLYCYEQLN) derived from the E7 protein of human papilloma virus (Fig. 4A) emphasizes the importance of the LXCXE motif in binding (23.Lee J-O.

In this complex the peptide binds in an extended β-strand type conformation such that the alternate Leu, Cys, and Glu side chains point into the protein and make specific contacts to it (Fig. 4A). Leu and Cys bind in hydrophobic pockets of complementary shape, whereas the Glu side chain forms hydrogen bonds to main chain amide groups of residues at the terminus of an α-helix; the strength of these interactions are augmented by the positive helix dipole (23.Lee J-O. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1998; 391: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). A peptide spanning the LXCXE motif from HPV E7 inhibits the binding of gankyrin to the pocket domain fragment of Rb. Similarly, a peptide encompassing residues 176-185 of gankyrin disrupted Rb-gankyrin interactions in pull-down assays (5.Li J. Tsai M-D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3977-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Three peptides in which the Leu, Cys, and Glu residues were individually swapped for Ala residues failed to block Rb-gankyrin binding. In gankyrin, the Leu178-Ala-Cys180-Asp-Glu182 sequence is embedded in helix 1 of ANK5 (Fig. 4B). Although the side chain of Glu-182 is exposed, those of Leu-178 and Cys-180 are partially and fully buried, respectively. For the LXCXE motif to bind to Rb in the same manner as the HPV E7 peptide, a major conformational change would be required necessitating significant unfolding of gankyrin. This seems implausible. Moreover, as discussed above, there is no precedent for such a mode of binding by ankyrin-repeat proteins to their partners. It seems, therefore, that the presence of an LXCXE motif in the gankyrin sequence is coincidental and that it is not used to bind to Rb in the same manner as does that of the HPV E7 peptide. It is very likely nevertheless that the LXCXE peptide binding site and gankyrin-binding sites on Rb overlap. It is also likely that the side chains of Leu178 and Glu182 contribute to the surface of the groove in gankyrin that is used in partner binding (Fig. 4B); moreover they are adjacent to the prominent negatively charged surface (Fig. 3). Consistent with their involvement in binding Rb, Glu182 to Ala and Leu178 to Ala mutations in gankyrin abolish and diminish Rb binding, respectively (1.Higasgituji H. Itoh K. Nagao T. Dawson S.D.

The Importance of Gankyrin Structure for Understanding Cell Division—Gankyrin competes with the multiple ankyrin-repeat pINKs (5.Li J. Tsai M-D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3977-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) to modulate cyclin-dependent kinase activity. Emphasizing the versatility of the ankyrin repeat scaffold as a molecular recognition surface, it appears that despite their similar folds (Figs. 1 and 2C) and common target, p16INK4 and gankyrin have overlapping rather than identical binding sites on CDK4. As a result, unlike p16INK4, gankyrin does not inhibit the kinase activity of CDK4. Gankyrin also appears to have separate functions in regulating the activities of other protein complexes involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis. Gankyrin directly interacts with Mdm2 to cause the polyubiquitylation and degradation of p53 in a p300-independent manner. 2H. Higashitsuji, H. Higashitsuji, K. Itoh, T. Nagao, T. Sakurai, S. Dawson, R. J. Mayer, and J. Fujita, manuscript in preparation. The cupped hand structure of gankyrin may be sufficiently promiscuous to be involved in the regulation of ubiquitylation by other ubiquitin ligases and, therefore, control other activities in DNA repair, transcription, and cell cycle control. The gankyrin orthologue in yeast, Nas6p, which was identified as an Rpt3-interacting protein (24.Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S.M. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3911) Google Scholar), has also been crystallized (25.Adachi N. Padmanabhan B. Kataoka K. Kijima K. Yamaki M. Horikoshi M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 859-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Its structure, reported in the accompanying paper, is very similar to that of gankyrin (root mean square deviation = 1.7 Å for 224 common Cα atoms). Gankyrin-protein complexes appear to have a central role in gene expression and apoptosis. Therefore, solving the structure of gankyrin is important not only for understanding the regulation of Rb and p53 functions but also to begin to consider strategies for the design of compounds that block gankyrin activities and provide a basis for drug development for therapeutic intervention in hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, there are no effective treatments for the growing global problem of liver cancer. It is clear from this and other recent studies that the presence of ankyrin repeats in a protein sequence allows confident prediction of fold, although little can be deduced regarding partner recognition and function. The next step in understanding molecular recognition in gankyrin is to determine the structure of this oncoprotein in complex with partner proteins or, failing this, fragments or even peptides derived from these proteins, which carry the gankyrin recognition determinants. We thank Dr. Masami Horikoshi for Nas6p coordinates."
https://openalex.org/W2080018502,"The karyopherin-related nuclear transport factor exportin-5 preferentially recognizes and transports RNAs containing minihelix motif, a structural cis-acting export element that comprises a double-stranded stem (>14 nucleotides) with a base-paired 5′ end and a 3–8-nucleotide protruding 3′ end. This structural motif is present in various small cellular and viral polymerase III transcripts such as the adenovirus VA1 RNA (VA1). Here we show that the double-stranded RNA-binding protein, ILF3 (interleukin enhancer binding factor 3) preferentially binds minihelix motif. Gel retardation assays and glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments revealed that ILF3, exportin-5, RanGTP, and VA1 RNA assembled in a quaternary complex in which the RNA moiety bridges the interaction between ILF3 and exportin-5. Formation of this complex is facilitated by the ability of both exportin-5 and ILF3 to mutually increase their apparent affinity for VA1 RNA. Using microinjection in the nucleus of HeLa cells and transfection experiments, we show here that formation of the cooperative RanGTP-dependent RNA/ILF3/exportin-5 complex promotes the co-transport of VA1 and ILF3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Exportin-5 thus appears as the first example of a nuclear export receptor that mediates RNA export but also promotes transport of proteinaceous cargo through appropriate and specific RNA adaptors."
https://openalex.org/W2034675367,"A mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase gene, designated NtMKP1, was isolated as a candidate gene for a calmodulin (CaM)-binding protein from tobacco. NtMKP1 protein has four characteristic domains conserved among plant MAPK phosphatases reported so far, namely a dual specificity protein phosphatase catalytic domain, gelsolin-like domain, putative CaM-binding domain (CaMBD), and serine-rich region, indicating that NtMKP1 is the ortholog of Arabidopsis MKP1. The bacterially expressed NtMKP1 protein physically interacted with three plant-specific types of CaM in an overlay assay with labeled CaMs, showing high affinity to NtCaM1 and NtCaM3 but lower affinity to NtCaM13. The peptide for the putative CaMBD bound both NtCaM1 and NtCaM3 significantly but bound NtCaM13 only slightly. Moreover, CaM overlay assays with mutated CaMBDs revealed that Trp440 and Leu443 in the middle of the basic amphiphilic α-helix motif (amino acids 436–453) are critical for binding CaM. In comparison with the transient accumulation of a wound-induced MAPK, WIPK transcript, a prolonged activation of NtMKP1 expression was found in response to wounding and tobacco mosaic virus-induced hypersensitive reaction. In transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing NtMKP1, wound-induced activation of SIPK, salicylic acid-induced MAPK, and WIPK was inhibited. These results suggest that plant CaMs are involved in these stress-activated MAPK cascades via NtMKP1.

In tobacco plants, salicylic acid-induced protein kinase (SIPK) and wound-induced protein kinase (WIPK) compose signaling cascades to exert defense responses such as expression of the pathogenesis-related (PR) gene and hypersensitive cell death (2.Seo S. Okamoto M. Seto H. Ishizuka K. Sano H. Ohashi Y. Science. 1995; 270: 1988-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 3.Seo S. Sano H. Ohashi Y.

Plant J. 2003; 33: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These MAPKs are activated transiently by various pathogens, pathogen-derived elicitors, or wounding, indicating that they are convergent points of the stress-induced signaling pathways. The activity of MAPKs is known to be strictly regulated via phosphorylation of the conserved TXY motif. A given MAPK is phosphorylated and activated by a corresponding MAPK kinase to transduce signal to downstream. Once transiently activated, MAPKs cannot be reactivated within at least 30 min of the refractory term (6.Usami S. Banno H. Ito Y. Nishihama R. Machida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8660-8664Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 7.Bögre L. Ligterink W. Meskiene I. Barker P.J. Heberle-Bor E. Huskisson N.S. Hirt H. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), implying the presence of a possible system to inactivate MAPK. Alfalfa MP2C and Arabidopsis DsPTP1 have been shown to be responsible for the dephosphorylation of activated MAPKs (8.Gupta R. Huang Y. Kieber J. Luan S. Plant J. 1998; 16: 581-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Meskiene I. Bögre L. Glaser W. Balog J. Brandstötter M. Zwerger K. Ammerer G. Hirt H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 18945-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recently, an Arabidopsis MAPK phosphatase, MKP1, was reported to be critical for inactivation of the SIPK ortholog MPK6 in a UV-irradiated plant (11.Ulm R. Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Peck S.C. Zhu T. Wang X. Shinozaki K. Paszkowski J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6483-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of MAPK dephosphorylation, including the involvement of Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM), has not been revealed. Another signal mediator, Ca2+, instantly accumulates in plant cells in response to various extracellular stimuli such as pathogen-derived elicitors or touching (12.Knight M.R. Campbell A.K. Smith S.M. Trewavas A.J. Nature. 1991; 352: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 13.Sanders D. Brownlee C. Harper J.F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 691-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). A number of pharmacological studies have suggested that this transient rise in the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ as well as protein phosphorylation contributes to the early phase of the defense response (14.Nürnberger T.

Plant J. 2000; 23: 441-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In tobacco cells treated with an elicitor, an increase in Ca2+ was reported to be indispensable for subsequent activation of MAPKs (18.Lebrun-Garcia A. Ouaked F. Chiltz A. Pugin A. Plant J. 1998; 15: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). CaM, a ubiquitous Ca2+ sensor, modulates the activity of a number of metabolic enzymes (19.Klee C.B. Vanaman T.C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 213-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). In plants, three plant-specific types of CaMs have been isolated and shown to have different profiles in activating known CaM-targeted enzymes (20.Lee S.H. Johnson J.D. Walsh M.P. Van Lierop J.E. Sutherland C. Xu A. Snedden W.A. Kosk-Kosicka D. Fromm H. Narayanan N. Cho M.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (see “CaM-dependent Enzyme Assays” for NtCaM1, NtCaM3, and NtCaM13). Healthy tobacco leaves mostly contain NtCaM3 and respond to wounding and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-triggered hypersensitive reaction (HR) by accumulating NtCaM1 type and NtCaM13 type CaMs, respectively (21.Yamakawa H. Mitsuhara I. Ito N. Seo S. Kamada H. Ohashi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3916-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SCaM-4 or NtCaM13 in plant cells, both of which belong to the same type of CaM accumulating after pathogen infection, often resulted in the constitutive expression of defense-related genes (22.Heo W.D. Lee S.H. Kim M.C. Kim J.C. Chung W.S. Chun H.J. Lee K.J. Park C.Y. Park H.C. Choi J.Y. Cho M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), 2H. Yamakawa, unpublished data. 2H. Yamakawa, unpublished data. suggesting that each CaM regulates the defense signaling after pathogen infection differently. In order to study the physiological roles of each CaM, the isolation and characterization of plant-derived CaM-binding targets are critical. Sequencing of the entire Arabidopsis genome has revealed at least 27 groups of possible CaM-binding proteins (CaMBPs) and more than 100 hypothetical CaMBPs (23.Reddy V.S. Ali G.S. Reddy A.S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9840-9852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Here we report the isolation of a MAPK phosphatase homolog as a new type of CaMBP and propose a possible interconnection between the MAPK cascade and Ca2+/CaM signaling. Plant Materials and Treatment for Synchronous HR Induction and Wounding—Tobacco plants containing the N resistance gene (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Samsun NN) were grown as described previously (21.Yamakawa H. Mitsuhara I. Ito N. Seo S. Kamada H. Ohashi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3916-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Well expanded upper leaves were detached and inoculated with or without (mock) 25 μg/ml purified TMV suspension by rubbing the surface with carborundum. Inoculated leaves were incubated for 40 h at 30 °C, allowing the virus to multiply but not lesions to form, and then transferred to 20 °C inducing synchronous lesion formation ∼8 h after the temperature shift. For wound treatment, tobacco leaves were cut into ∼3-cm squares with a razor blade and incubated at 22 °C. All samples were incubated under continuous illumination at an intensity of 120 μmol of photons meter–2 s–1. After an appropriate period of incubation, the leaves were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until use. Total soluble protein extracted from tobacco leaves with 3 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25 m sucrose, 13 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, and one tablet of proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) per 33 ml was centrifuged at 290,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for CaM-binding assays as described below. Production of CaM Proteins—Recombinant CaM proteins, NtCaM1, NtCaM3, and NtCaM13, were produced by Escherichia coli harboring pET-NtCaM1, pET-NtCaM3, and pET-NtCaM13, respectively, and purified by Ca2+-dependent hydrophobic chromatography, as described previously (21.Yamakawa H. Mitsuhara I. Ito N. Seo S. Kamada H. Ohashi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3916-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Bovine brain CaM was obtained from Wako and used as a control for the enzyme assays. The protein concentration was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. CaM-dependent Enzyme Assays—Pea NAD+ kinase was partially purified from pea seedlings (Pisum sativam L. cv. Akabana-tsurunashiendo) by the method of Muto and Miyachi (24.Muto S. Miyachi S. Plant Physiol. 1977; 59: 55-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NAD+ kinase assay was conducted as described previously (25.Harmon A.C. Jarrett H.W. Cormier M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Nitric-oxide synthase activity was evaluated with the citrulline assay as described by Kumar et al. (26.Kumar V.B. Bernardo A.E. Alshaher M.M. Buddhiraju M. Purushothaman R. Morley J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) using a recombinant rat neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (Calbiochem). The activity of a CaM-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin (CaN), was determined using a bovine brain CaN (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), as reported previously (27.Anthony F.A. Merat D.L. Cheung W.Y. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The Vmax (the maximal activity compared with that of bovine CaM) and the Kact (the concentration of CaM required for half-maximal activity) for NtCaM1, NtCaM3, and NtCaM13 were 207, 235, and 9% and 16, 9, and 26 nm for pea NAD+ kinase; 98, 67, and 119% and 56, 89, and 67 nm for rat nitric-oxide synthase; and 81, 130, and 74% and 4.6, 4.0, and 7.5 nm for bovine CaN, respectively. Briefly, NtCaM3 was the potent activator of NAD+ kinase and CaN but not of nitric-oxide synthase, whereas NtCaM13 was highest in the extent of activation for nitric-oxide synthase but lowest for NAD+ kinase and CaN. NtCaM1 showed the intermediate characteristics. The activation of all enzymes above is Ca2+-dependent, since no activation was detected in the absence of Ca2+. Labeling of CaM Proteins and CaM-binding Assay—Purified CaM proteins were labeled with alkaline phosphatase (AP) (Nacalai Tesque) by the method of Liao and Zielinski (28.Liao B. Zielinski R.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 49: 487-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Protein extract from plant or E. coli was fractionated on a SDS-PAGE gel and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. For detection of CaMBPs, the membrane was blocked with a 2% casein solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, or 5 mm EDTA. Then it was incubated with AP-conjugated CaM (3.2 μg/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EDTA containing 0.5% gelatin, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.02% NaN3 for 1 h and washed five times for 5 min each in the same buffer without CaM. Following three washes each for 5 min with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2, CaMBPs were visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). Screening of CaMBP Clones—Complementary DNA libraries prepared from TMV-infected leaves at 12 h after the temperature shift and from injured leaves 30 min after wounding (21.Yamakawa H. Mitsuhara I. Ito N. Seo S. Kamada H. Ohashi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3916-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) were subjected to E. coli expression screening. Approximately 4 × 105 unamplified recombinant phages from each library were screened using a mixture containing equal amounts of AP-conjugated NtCaM1, NtCaM3, and NtCaM13. The CaM-binding assay was conducted as mentioned above. Individual positive plaques were purified by several rounds of plating and CaM-binding assay, and the cDNAs were excised with helper phage and recircularized to generate subclones in the plasmid pBluescript SK according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends—Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from healthy tobacco leaves by guanidine thiocyanate/cesium chloride ultracentrifugation (29.Kingston R.E. Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Siedman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York1996: 4.2.1-4.2.9Google Scholar) and subsequent purification with OligotexdT30, Super (Roche Applied Science). Complementary DNA for PCR was synthesized with a cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) following the manufacturer's instructions. The full-length cDNA for NtMKP1 was obtained by both 3′ and 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends and subsequent end-to-end PCR using the same cDNA. The full-length sequence was verified by sequencing individual subclones generated by three independent PCRs. Sequencing and Sequence Analyses—The NtMKP1 cDNA subcloned into the pBluescript SK or pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen) vector was sequenced on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method using DNA-sequencing kits and a model 310 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) or a model CEQ-2000 DNA sequencer (Beckman). Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed with the Genetyx software system (Software Development Co.). Amino acid sequences of MAPK phosphatases from various organisms were obtained by GenBank™ searches. DNA and RNA Gel Blot Analyses—Ten micrograms each of genomic DNA isolated from N. tabacum cv. Samsun NN, N. tabacum cv. Samsun, Nicotiana sylvestris, and Nicotiana tomentosiformis was digested with EcoRI, HindIII, or XbaI, separated on a 1.0% agarose gel, and then transferred to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane filter (Amersham Biosciences). For RNA gel blot analysis, 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was fractionated by formaldehyde-denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were subjected to hybridization with the 32P-labeled probes as described previously (21.Yamakawa H. Mitsuhara I. Ito N. Seo S. Kamada H. Ohashi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3916-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and routinely washed twice for 15 min each in 2× SSC (1× SSC: 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS at 25 °C and three times for 20 min each in 0.5× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C and imaged with a PhosphorImager SI (Amersham Biosciences). The coding region or the NcoI/SpeI fragment (corresponding to nucleotides +1077 to +2104 bp from the translational start position) of the NtMKP1 gene was used as a probe. The cDNA probes for detecting WIPK, PR-1a, PI-II, and NtCaM transcripts were used as described previously (21.Yamakawa H. Mitsuhara I. Ito N. Seo S. Kamada H. Ohashi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3916-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Production of Recombinant NtMKP1 Proteins in E. coli—To construct plasmids for recombinant NtMKP1 proteins, the coding region was amplified by PCR with XhoI and BamHI sites attached at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, and verified by DNA sequencing. The fragment was subcloned into the vector pET15b (Novagen), which had been digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes, allowing the production of NtMKP1 protein with a His6 tag at the N-terminal. For production of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein, the same fragment was subcloned between XhoI and NotI sites of the pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) by blunting BamHI and NotI sites. The resulting constructs, pET-NtMKP1 and pGEX-NtMKP1, the integrity of which was verified by nucleotide sequencing, were expressed in E. coli Rosetta(DE3) (Novagen) by incubation in 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 20 h at 20 °C. To purify Histagged protein, the bacterial cells were collected and resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole. Following lysis by sonication, the protein was separated by centrifugation into soluble and insoluble fractions. The His-tagged protein was purified by nickel column chromatography (HisTrap; Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions except that 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 100 mm NaCl was used instead of phosphate buffer. For purification of GST fusion protein, the bacterial cells were pelleted and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and one tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Applied Science) per 50 ml. Cells were lysed by sonication followed by centrifugation to produce soluble and insoluble fractions. The GST fusion protein in the supernatant was subjected to chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) column, washed with the same buffer without any detergent, and then eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm reduced glutathione. In order to determine the domain that CaM binds, several deletion constructs were prepared. The pGEX-NtMKP1 was digested by NdeI or NcoI and blunted. The fragments were then cut with BamHI, and the resulting fragments were subcloned into a pGEX4T-1 vector digested with BamHI and SmaI, generating the GST fusion constructs designated GST-NtMKP1-(1–276) and GST-NtMKP1-(1–361). The cDNA fragment corresponding to the residues 362–467 residues of NtMKP1 was amplified by PCR with BamHI and SmaI sites attached to the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, and subcloned into the corresponding sites of a pGEX4T-1 vector, resulting in the GST-NtMKP1-(362–467) construct. The GST-NtMKP1-(468–862) construct was produced by subcloning the MscI/NotI-digested fragment of pGEX-NtMKP1 between the SmaI and NotI sites of a pGEX4T-1 vector. Introduction of site-directed mutagenesis into the CaMBD of the GST-NtMKP1-(362–467) construct was performed using a Mutan-Super Express Km kit (Takara) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The sequences of the primers used are as follows (the sites of mutation are underlined): for L433R, 5′-AGATGCGTCGTCCTGCAAGA-3′; for W440R, 5′-AGAATGGAAGGAGTAGATTG-3′; for L443R, 5′-GGAGTAGAAGGAGGCGAAAG-3′. The production and purification of the truncated or mutated GST-NtMKP1 proteins were conducted as described above. CaM-Peptide Mobility Shift Assay—The stoichiometry of binding of CaMs and CaMBD was assessed by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) as described by Erickson-Viitanen and DeGrado (30.Erickson-Viitanen S. DeGrado W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 139: 455-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A peptide containing the putative CaMBD of NtMKP1 (amino acid residues 396–447) was synthesized. Two micrograms of respective CaM and increasing amounts of the peptide were incubated in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and either 1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA at room temperature for 1 h in a volume of 20 μl. A one-fourth volume of 50% glycerol and tracer bromphenol blue was added, and the mixture was applied to a 15% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA. The gel was run at a constant current of 25 mA in an electrode buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl, 192 mm glycine (pH 8.3), and 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA, stained with Coomassie Blue R250. Construction of NtMKP1 Transgene Vector and Tobacco Transformation—For preparation of the plasmid to generate the NtMKP1-overexpressing transgenic plants, the coding region was amplified by PCR with XhoI and BamHI sites attached at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, and verified by DNA sequencing. The fragment was subcloned between XhoI and EcoRI sites of the pEl2Ω-MCS vector (31.Ohtsubo N. Mitsuhara I. Koga M. Seo S. Ohashi Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 808-817Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar) in the sense orientation by blunting BamHI and EcoRI sites. The NtMKP1 expression construct was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 by electroporation (32.Wen-jun S. Forde B.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The pEl2Ω-MCS vector, which has only a marker gene, NPT-II, expressed, was used to produce the control transgenic plants. Transformation of Samsun NN tobacco was performed with the leaf disc cocultivation method (33.Horsch R.B. Fry J.E. Hoffmann N.L. Eichholtz D. Rogers S.G. Fraley R.T. Science. 1985; 227: 1229-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (3717) Google Scholar). Plantlets were transplanted to pots containing vermiculite and grown in an isolated greenhouse maintained at 25 °C under sunlight. Phosphatase Assay—To study the generic phosphatase activity of recombinant NtMKP1 proteins, pyronitrophenyl phosphate or 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate was used as substrate. The assay was conducted as described previously (8.Gupta R. Huang Y. Kieber J. Luan S. Plant J. 1998; 16: 581-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of purified fractions (containing 14.6 and 11.3 μg of protein for His tag and GST fusion, respectively) were added to the reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing 2 mm pyronitrophenyl phosphate or 200 μm 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate. The reaction was run at 30 °C for various time periods. The resulting product, p-nitrophenol or 4-methyl umbelliferone, was quantified by monitoring A405 using a Beckman spectrophotometer (model DU-7400) or fluorescence using a microtiter plate reader (Spectra Max Gemini EM; Molecular Devices) with an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and an emission wavelength of 446 nm. MAPK Activity Assay and Protein Gel Blot Analysis—The activity of defense-related MAPKs, SIPK and WIPK, was analyzed with the myelin basic protein (MBP) kinase assay as described previously (2.Seo S. Okamoto M. Seto H. Ishizuka K. Sano H. Ohashi Y. Science. 1995; 270: 1988-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 3.Seo S. Sano H. Ohashi Y. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Protein gel blot analysis was conducted as described previously (3.Seo S. Sano H. Ohashi Y. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) using anti-SIPK and anti-WIPK antibodies. Cloning of CaM-binding Proteins—Previously, we isolated three types of plant-specific CaMs (NtCaM1, NtCaM3, and NtCaM13), which respond differently to pathogen invasion and wounding (21.Yamakawa H. Mitsuhara I. Ito N. Seo S. Kamada H. Ohashi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3916-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In order to identify the target molecules of the divergent CaMs, soluble protein extracted from tobacco leaf was fractionated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to a ligand-binding assay with AP-conjugated CaMs (AP-CaM1, AP-CaM3, and AP-CaM13) to survey tobacco endogenous CaMBPs. A number of proteins were detected in the presence of Ca2+ but not in the absence of Ca2+ (data not shown), indicating the presence of CaMBPs in the tobacco extract. Protein extract from leaves 6 h after wounding or 36 h after the induction of TMV-dependent HR showed substantially similar CaMBP profiles (data not shown). To isolate the genes encoding CaMBPs, we screened phage expression libraries with AP-labeled CaMs. From 4 × 105 plaque-forming units each of cDNA libraries prepared from wounded leaves and HR-induced leaves, 39 independent clones were isolated. Nucleotide sequencing resulted in 14 distinct genes obtained. A BLASTX search revealed that most are homologous to known CaMBP genes. However, one clone showed significant similarity to a plant-specific MAPK phosphatase that was recently reported to be involved in a genotoxic stress response (11.Ulm R. Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Peck S.C. Zhu T. Wang X. Shinozaki K. Paszkowski J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6483-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends encodes a protein of 862 amino acid residues with 50.2% identity to the Arabidopsis MAPK phosphatase, MKP1, and was designated NtMKP1. Structure of the NtMKP1 Gene—The predicted amino acid sequence of NtMKP1 was compared with sequences of MAPK phosphatases from various organisms. A BLASTX search revealed that NtMKP1 has no significant overall homology to mammalian or Drosophila MAPK phosphatase. The comparison allowed us to identify four domains conserved among plant MAPK phosphatases as shown in Fig. 1. As reported previously (34.Ulm R. Revenkova E. di Sansebastiano G.-P. Bechtold N. Paszkowski J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), a dual specificity phosphatase catalytic domain and gelsolin homology domain, corresponding to residues 168–252 and 290–357 of NtMKP1, respectively, were highly conserved, including Asp170, Cys201, and Ser208, which are essential for catalytic activity. Additionally, the domain from amino acid 396 to 447 of NtMKP1 is also conserved among plant MAPK phosphatases, with basic and hydrophobic residues frequently appearing. Moreover, the domain is followed by a Ser-rich region corresponding to residues 448–607 in the case of NtMKP1. The partial cDNA fragment originally isolated by interaction with CaM contains the stretch downstream of Asp128, and most CaM-binding sequences are known to have a basic hydrophobic nature, leading us to predict that the domain from residue 396 to 447 is the region to which CaMs bind. DNA gel blot analysis with a low stringency wash that allows a 30% mismatch in the nucleotide sequence was performed. Taking account of one and two internal restriction sites for EcoRI and HindIII, respectively, the tobacco genome was found to have two copies of similar genes (Fig. 2). Since tobacco has an amphidiploid genotype originating from N. tomentosiformis and N. sylvestris, we concluded that NtMKP1 is the gene orthologous to Arabidopsis MKP1.

Searching to identify the pathway involved, we observed that (i) the stimulating effect of glutamine was totally mimicked by glucosamine addition, and (ii) its effect but not that of glucosamine was totally blocked by 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON), an inhibitor of amidotransferases, suggesting that the metabolism of glutamine to glucosamine 6-phosphate was required. Moreover, run-on assays revealed that glucosamine was acting at a transcriptional level. Because three functional GC boxes were identified on the ASS gene promoter (Anderson, G. M., and Freytag, S. O. (1991) Mol. Cell Biol. 11, 1935–1943), the potential involvement of Sp1 family members was studied. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using either the Sp1 consensus sequence or an appropriate fragment of the ASS promoter sequence as a probe demonstrated that both glutamine and glucosamine increased Sp1 DNA binding. Immunoprecipitation-Western blot experiments demonstrated that both compounds increased O-glycosylation of Sp1 leading to its translocation into nucleus. Again, the effect of glutamine on Sp1 was inhibited by the addition of DON but not of glucosamine. Taken together, the results clearly demonstrate that the metabolism of glutamine through the hexosamine pathway leads to the cytosolic O-glycosylation of Sp1, which, in turn, translocates into nucleus and stimulates the ASS gene transcription. Collectively, the results constitute the first demonstration of a functional relationship between a regulating signal (glutamine), a transcription factor (Sp1), and the transcription of the ASS gene.

It is now well established that amino acids may regulate the expression of mammalian genes when added or suppressed in the medium of cultured cells (for review, see Refs. 1Kilberg M.S. Hutson R.G.

Among amino acids, glutamine, which is the most abundant circulating amino acid, stimulates or inhibits the expression of various genes. This includes (i) intracellular proteins such as transcription factors (3Rhoads J.M. Argenzio A.R. Chen W. Rippe R.A. Westwick J.K. Cox A.D. Berschneider H.M. Brenner D.A. Am. J.

Sci. 2002; 43: 2791-2798PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the glutamine effect is not totally understood and may depend on the cell type studied. For example, glutamine metabolism was involved in the stimulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene expression in isolated rat hepatocytes (16Lavoinne A. Husson A. Quillard M. Chédeville A. Fairand A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and c-jun gene expression in enterocytes (3Rhoads J.M. Argenzio A.R. Chen W. Rippe R.A. Westwick J.K. Cox A.D. Berschneider H.M. Brenner D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G943-G953PubMed Google Scholar), but amino acid-induced cell swelling was also identified as the inducing pathway on gene expression in hepatocytes (5Theodoropoulos P.A.

Moreover, studying the regulation of the expression of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) 1The abbreviations used are: ASSargininosuccinate synthetaseC/EBPCCAAT/enhancer-binding proteinDON6-diazo-5-oxonorleucineEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayGFATl-glutamine:d-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase. (EC 6.3.4.5.), the key enzyme of arginine synthesis, we observed that the mechanism involved might depend on the cell type studied. Indeed, we previously reported that the glutamine-induced cell swelling was involved in hepatocytes because hypo-osmolarity totally mimicked the glutamine stimulating effect on the mRNA level (10Quillard M. Husson A. Lavoinne A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 56-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); but this was not the case in Caco-2 cells, a human intestinal cell line (17Husson A. Brasse-Lagnel C. Fairand A. Renouf S. Lavoinne A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1887-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The present work was therefore begun to specify the molecular mechanism involved in the stimulating effect of glutamine on ASS gene expression in Caco-2 cells. argininosuccinate synthetase CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine electrophoretic mobility shift assay l-glutamine:d-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase. The results obtained clearly demonstrate that the metabolism of glutamine through the hexosamine pathway is required and leads to the cytosolic O-glycosylation of Sp1, which, in turn, stimulates the transcription of the ASS gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report for the ASS gene of a functional relationship among a regulating signal (glutamine), a transcription factor (Sp1), and the transcription rate of the gene. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, non-essential amino acids, and fetal calf serum were purchased from Eurobio (France); l-glutamine, glucosamine, mannosamine, 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON), antibiotics, protease inhibitor mixture (P8340), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture 1 (P2850) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Hybond-N Nylon membranes, radiolabeled elements [α-32 P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and [α-32 P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), the Megaprime kit, ECL Western blotting detection system, poly[d(I-C)], and Hyperfilm were provided by Amersham Biosciences. Human ASS cDNA (pAS419) was kindly provided by Dr. A. L. Beaudet, Houston, TX (18Su T.S. Bock H.G. O'Brien W.E. Beaudet A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11826-11831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase and Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc; RL2) from Affinity BioReagents. The Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide probe (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGCCAG-3′) and polynucleotide kinase T4 were purchased from Promega. Purification columns and polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratories. Cell Culture—Caco-2/TC7 cells, a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air incubator. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% non-essential amino acids, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin was used. Cells between passages 30 and 60 were seeded at a density of 12 × 103 cells/cm2 onto 100-mm dishes. The cells were grown for 2 days after confluence, and 24 h before the experiments, the medium was changed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. They were then cultured in the absence or presence of glutamine or hexosamine as indicated. ASS Assay—ASS activity was measured at 37 °C according to McLean et al. (19Mc Lean P. Novello F. Gurney M.W. Biochem. J. 1965; 94: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and the results were expressed as units (μmol/h)/mg protein with bovine serum albumin as standard. Northern Blot Analysis—Cells were washed and scraped with phosphate-buffered saline, and isolation of total RNA was performed by a guanidinium thiocyanate procedure (20Chomczymski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA (25 μg) was separated onto a 1.5% agarose/formaldehyde gel, transferred onto nylon membranes, and probed with32P-labeled ASS cDNA. Hybridizations were performed overnight at 42 °C as described previously (21Bourgeois P. Harlin J.C. Renouf S. Goutal I. Fairand A. Husson A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Blots were then washed and exposed to Hyperfilm using intensifying screens at -80 °C for periods varying from 6 to 72 h. The blots were reprobed with a 18 S ribosomal RNA probe for data normalization. Nuclear Run-on Transcription Assays—Preparation of the nuclei and RNA polymerase elongation reaction was performed as described (22Vannice J.L. Taylor J.M. Ringold G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4241-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For transcription, 107 nuclei were incubated for 30 min at 28 °C in 200 μl of reaction mixture containing 15% glycerol, 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 4 mm creatine phosphate, 15 units/ml creatine kinase, 1 mm spermidine, 0.5 mm each ATP, CTP, and GTP, and 500 units/ml RNasin in the presence of 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP. Then, 40 units of DNase I were added, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min before RNA extraction. Denatured plasmids (5 μg) were spotted onto nylon membrane, and each DNA-bearing filter was prehybridized and then hybridized with 5 × 106 cpm of labeled RNA at 42 °C for 3 days. Hybridization was carried out with three plasmids including pAS419, pBR322 as control for nonspecific binding, and an 18 S rRNA probe as internal control. Filters were then washed and exposed to Hyperfilm at -80 °C with intensifying screens. The relative amount of labeled nuclear transcripts hybridized to plasmids was determined by densitometric scanning of autoradiograms. Preparation of Nuclear Fractions—Caco-2 cells were rinsed and scraped from the culture dishes in cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted. The pellet was lysed in buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCL, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25% Nonidet-P40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (P8340), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture 1 (P2850). After a 5-min incubation on ice, the nuclear pellet was isolated by centrifugation (2 min; 12,000 × g). The supernatant was saved as the cytosolic extract. The nuclear pellet was then suspended on ice in nuclear extract buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and P8340 and P2850 and incubated for 15 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was saved as the nuclear extract. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford assay (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 71: 248-254Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Single-stranded complementary oligonucleotides of ASS promoter (38 pb) were prepared and annealed by custom oligonucleotide synthesis (Eurogentec). The probe corresponded to nucleotides -121 to -84, a sequence containing two functional GC boxes (24Anderson G.M. Freytag S.O. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 1935-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotide (200 ng) and Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide probe (3.75 pmol) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase T4. Labeled probes were purified from unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP using a purification column and recovered in Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 7.8. An aliquot of nuclear proteins (15 μg) was prepared in buffer containing 5% glycerol (v/v), 12.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.05 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 1 μg of poly[d(I-C)]. Labeled probe (50,000–100,000 cpm) was then added, and the samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The specificity of Sp1 DNA-binding was determined in competition reactions in which a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled Sp1 oligonucleotide or ASS promoter was added to the binding reaction 10 min prior to the addition of radiolabeled probe. For supershift assays, antibodies (4 μg) against Sp1, Sp2, or Sp3 were added to the reaction mixture 20 min prior to the addition of radiolabeled Sp1 probe. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel using TBE (0.45 m Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) followed by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Sp1 antibodies (1 μg) were incubated with protein G-agarose overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, nuclear or cytosolic proteins (500 μg) from Caco-2 cells were added in binding buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm orthovanadate) for 2 h at 4 °C. The mixture was pelleted, and the pellet was washed twice in the binding buffer and twice in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. Immunoprecipitated Sp1 proteins were suspended in Western sample buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% SDS), boiled, subjected to electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and then electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking for 1 h with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk, the membranes were incubated with O-linked GlcNAc antibody (RL2; dilution 1:1,000) or Sp1 antibody (1:750) in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Then they were washed and incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 1 h. Peroxidase labeling was detected using the ECL Western blotting detection system. Data Analysis and Statistics—Signals on EMSA, Western blot, and Northern blot autoradiographic films were quantitated by scanning the films using a Shimadzu densitometer linked to a computer analysis system (Lecphor). Relative ASS mRNA levels were normalized by the corresponding 18 S bands. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance of differences was calculated by Student's t test for paired data. Glutamine Stimulated ASS Gene Expression through the Hexosamine Pathway in Caco-2 Cells—As shown on fig 1A, culturing the cells with 2 mm glutamine for 24 h induced a 1.6-fold increase in ASS activity, and the stimulatory effect was significantly higher at 10 mm than at 2 mm glutamine. Such a stimulating effect of glutamine on ASS activity was associated with a similar increase in the ASS mRNA level (Fig. 1B; also see Fig 1C for mRNA). A dose-response study confirmed that the effect of glutamine on ASS was dose-dependent and the half-maximum stimulatory effect was obtained at about 1.5 mm (Fig. 1D). To check if glutamine metabolism was involved, we tested the influence of DON, an inhibitor of glutamine amidotransferases (25Sayeski P.P. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15237-15243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Culturing the cells in the presence of 40 μm DON totally inhibited the stimulatory effect of 10 mm glutamine on ASS activity (control: 0.33 ± 0.08 unit/mg = 100%; + Gln: 191 ± 14% (significantly different from control cells); + Gln + DON: 109 ± 31%; n = 3, p < 0.05). This therefore demonstrated that the metabolism of glutamine was required. Among amidotransferases, DON is known to inhibit l-glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) (EC 2.6.1.16) (25Sayeski P.P. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15237-15243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the key enzyme of the hexosamine pathway, which produces glucosamine 6-phosphate. To assess the involvement of this pathway, we tested the influence of glucosamine, a compound entering the hexosamine pathway downstream of GFAT. Culturing the cells with 10 mm glucosamine for 24 h induced an ∼2-fold increase in the ASS activity, which was associated with a similar increase in the ASS mRNA level (Fig. 2A; also see Fig. 2B for mRNA) as observed with glutamine. A time-course study of the effect of 10 mm glucosamine on the mRNA level revealed that the effect appeared as soon as 2 h and increased for up to 6 h, remaining at the maximal value up to 24 h (data not shown). Moreover, the half-maximum effect of glucosamine was obtained at about 2.0 mm on ASS activity (Fig. 2C). Then, we assessed the specificity of the effect of glucosamine. By culturing the cells in the presence of 10 mm mannosamine, we were unable to detect any stimulating effect on either ASS activity or mRNA level (Fig. 2A). This was also true when replacing mannosamine by galactosamine (data not shown). Finally, and as expected, the stimulatory effect of glucosamine persisted in the presence of 40 μm DON (control: 0.33 ± 0.08 unit/mg = 100%; + GlcN: 216 ± 35%*; + GlcN + DON: 272 ± 60% (significantly different from control cells); n = 3, p < 0.05). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrated that the effect of glutamine was a consequence of its metabolism through the hexosamine pathway. To specify the level of action of glutamine on the expression of the ASS gene, we tested the influence of glucosamine on the rate of transcription of the gene by using nuclear run-on assay. As shown in Fig. 2D for a representative experiment, 10 mm glucosamine induced a 2-fold increase in the rate of transcription of the ASS gene. Because glucosamine stimulated gene transcription, mRNA level, and protein activity with a similar order of magnitude (i.e. about 2-fold), this strongly suggested that the stimulation of the transcription of the ASS gene could account for all the effects observed.Fig. 2Influence of hexosamines on ASS activity, mRNA level, and gene transcription. Caco-2 cells were cultured for 20 h (A–C) or 5 h (D) in the absence (control) or presence of 10 mm hexosamine. ASS activity and mRNA level were measured as described in the legend for Fig. 1.

The autoradiogram is representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Then, we intended to identify the transcription factor(s) involved, focusing on the Sp family because (i) only GC (Sp-binding) boxes have been identified as functional sequences on the ASS gene promoter (24Anderson G.M. Freytag S.O. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 1935-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and (ii) glucosamine recently has been reported to activate Sp1 and Sp3 (26Goldberg H.J. Scholey J. Fantus I.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 863-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Glucosamine and Glutamine Increased Sp1 Binding on the ASS Gene Promoter—Caco-2 cells were cultured with or without 10 mm glucosamine for different periods of time, as indicated, and EMSAs were performed. As shown in Fig. 3A by using the consensus sequence of the Sp1-binding site, glucosamine induced a progressive increase in a major band, attaining a 2-fold increase at 6 h (2.17 ± 0.26; n = 3; p < 0.05). Such a band corresponded to the Sp1-binding complex because the band totally disappeared when a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled Sp1 oligonucleotide was added (Fig. 3A, lane 10) and supershifted when anti-Sp1 antibody was added (Fig. 3A, lane 8); the complex was not competed away by an excess of unlabeled nonspecific DNA sequence (lane 11). Besides the major band, the figure also shows that glucosamine induced a slight increase in another minor band. This minor but specific band, which was not supershifted by adding anti-Sp1 antibody, was then identified as Sp3 (see below). To ascertain that Sp1 was also involved in the glutamine effect, we performed EMSA experiments from cells cultured in the presence of 10 mm glutamine. As shown in Fig. 3B, glutamine induced a significant increase in Sp1 binding, persisting up to 20 h and corresponding to a 1.5-fold increase (1.50 ± 0.01; n = 3; p < 0.05). Finally, and to verify that the hexosamine pathway was involved, we tested the influence of DON on the effect of both glutamine and glucosamine. The addition of DON totally inhibited the increasing effect of glutamine on Sp1 binding but was without any effect on the binding induced by glucosamine (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrated that glutamine stimulated the DNA binding activity of Sp1 through the hexosamine pathway. In addition, we were unable to detect any stimulating effect of glutamine on Sp1 DNA binding by culturing the cells in a glucose-deprived medium (data not shown). To specify whether Sp1 was actually involved in the increase in the rate of transcription of the ASS gene, we also performed EMSA experiments by using an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to a fragment of the ASS gene promoter containing two functional GC boxes (24Anderson G.M. Freytag S.O. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 1935-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, glutamine and glucosamine increased the binding of Sp1 (lanes 2–7 and lane 11 for supershift experiments), and also Sp3, because a very slight increase in Sp3 binding could be observed (lanes 12 and 13 for supershift experiments). Finally, the addition of anti-Sp2 antibody was unable to induce any supershift (Fig. 3C, lane 14) demonstrating that, among the Sp family, Sp2 was not involved in the glutamine effect. Thus, Sp1 was responsible for the stimulating effect of glutamine on ASS gene expression, a result that demonstrates the physiological role of the GC boxes previously identified in the promoter fragment (24Anderson G.M. Freytag S.O. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 1935-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because glutamine acts through the hexosamine pathway, we then investigated the possibility that glutamine may activate the DNA binding activity of Sp factors via their glycosylation, focusing on Sp1 as the main factor involved. Glucosamine and Glutamine Increased the Cytosolic O-glycosylation of Sp1—Caco-2 cells were cultured with or without glucosamine or glutamine (10 mm each) as indicated, and the glycosylation status of Sp1 was measured on nuclear extracts by using the RL2 antibody recognizing N-acetylglucosamine attached to Ser or Thr. As shown in Fig. 4A, the addition of glucosamine for 4 h induced an increase in both the glycosylation status and the level of Sp1, corresponding to an ∼2-fold increase (1.86 ± 0.15 and 1.80 ± 0.16, respectively; n = 4; p < 0.05). Similarly, culturing the cells for 20 h with glutamine also induced an increase in both the level and the glycosylation status of Sp1 (Fig. 4A). Because glucosamine and glutamine increased the level of Sp1 and its glycosylation status with a similar order of magnitude, this strongly suggested that both compounds acted by increasing the amount of Sp1 without any change in its glycosylation status into the nucleus. Experiments were therefore conducted to study the glycosylation status of Sp1 measured on cytosolic extracts from Caco-2 cells cultured for 20 h with or without glutamine or glucosamine (10 mm each). As shown in Fig. 4B, the addition of glutamine induced an increase in the glycosylation status of Sp1, and the addition of DON totally inhibited the increase. Moreover, such an increase was also observed in the presence of glucosamine but was not inhibited by the addition of DON. Taken together, these results suggested that glutamine stimulates the cytosolic O-glycosylation of Sp1 leading to its translocation from cytosol to nucleus. To ascertain such a phenomenon, Caco-2 cells were cultured for various periods of time with or without glucosamine, and the glycosylation status of Sp1 was measured on both cytosolic and nuclear extracts from the same batch of cells (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5B, the addition of glucosamine induced a progressive increase in the glycosylation status of Sp1 in the cytosol, which was associated with a parallel decrease in the level of Sp1 (Fig. 5D). Concomitantly, we observed a progressive increase in the level of Sp1 into the nucleus of the same cells in the presence of glucosamine (Fig. 5E) but without any change in its glycosylation status (Fig. 5C). Thus, these results clearly demonstrated that glucosamine induced the O-glycosylation of Sp1 in the cytosol leading to its translocation into the nucleus.Fig. 5Time-course study of the effect of glucosamine on Sp1 protein level and O-linked glycosylation. Cytosolic and nuclear proteins were extracted from the same batch of cells cultured in the absence (○, control) or presence of 10 mm glucosamine (•, GlcN) for different periods of time as indicated.

To our knowledge, this is the first report proposing a complete scheme for the regulation of the expression of a gene by glutamine and also the first demonstration of a link between a transcription factor, namely Sp1, and a signal molecule for the regulation of the expression of the ASS gene. Indeed, concerning the former point, Sp1 was the only factor shown to interact with three proximal promoter sequences (GC boxes) of the ASS gene 12 years ago (24Anderson G.M. Freytag S.O. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 1935-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), but no link between Sp1 and various signal molecules including hormones, cytokines, and amino acids has been reported up to the present. Moreover, in the context of the effect of amino acids on the regulation of gene expression, it should be pointed out that neither amino acid response elements nor nutrient-sensing response elements could be identified on the ASS proximal promoter (17Husson A. Brasse-Lagnel C. Fairand A. Renouf S. Lavoinne A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1887-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) in contrast to CHOP (C/EBP homology protein) and asparagine synthase genes (27Bruhat A. Averous J. Carraro V. Zhong C.

Additionally, a number of transcription factors, namely activator protein-1 (AP-1 (29Li L. Gotta S. Mauviel A. Varga J. Cell Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 361-368PubMed Google Scholar)), hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 (HNF-1 (30Marten N.W. Hsiang C.-H. Yu L. Stollenwerk N.S. Straus D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1447: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)), activating transcription factor-4 (ATF-4) (28Siu F.S. Blain P.J. Leblanc-Chaffin R. Chen H. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 48100-48107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), were also involved in the regulation of the expression of genes by amino acids, but again the responsive elements to these transcription factors were not identified on the ASS gene promoter. Thus, our results focused on the importance of Sp1 to regulate ASS gene expression by amino acids, and we observed that this factor could bind the GC boxes of the ASS promoter under the influence of glutamine. Moreover, we also observed a weak increase in Sp3 binding activity suggesting that, beside Sp1, the ASS gene might be regulated by Sp3 but to a lesser extent than Sp1. Interestingly, studying the expression of the asparagine synthase gene, histidine limitation was recently shown to stimulate Sp1/Sp3 DNA binding (33Leung-Pineda V. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16585-16591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Beside amino acids, Sp1 can be regulated by different stimuli such as growth factors, lipopolysaccharide, cAMP, or hyperglycemia (26Goldberg H.J. Scholey J. Fantus I.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 863-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 35Black A.R. Jensen D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 31863-31870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Most of these regulations were shown to occur through post-translational changes, i.e. phosphorylation and glycosylation (37Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 38Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Concerning O-glycosylation, Sp1 was shown to be a target of the hexosamine pathway (26Goldberg H.J. Scholey J. Fantus I.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 863-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), but the increase in glycosylation could both stimulate or inhibit its transcriptional activity (39Roos M.D. Su K. Baker J.R. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 6472-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 40Du W.L. Edelstein D. Rossetti L. Fantus I.G. Goldberg H. Ziyadeh F. Wu J. Brownlee M. Proc.

Acta. 1999; 1473: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar and 44Wells L. Hart G.W. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Such a post-translational modification is now recognized to play an important role in regulating signal transduction and transcription (43Comer F.I. Hart G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Our results on the ASS gene reinforce the notion that O-glycosylation may activate Sp1 DNA binding and, therefore, gene transcription. However, concerning the role of glycosylation in Sp1 activation, our data demonstrate that O-glycosylation is required for its translocation into the nucleus because the Sp1 nuclear protein level/glycosylation status ratio was unchanged under the influence of both glutamine and glucosamine (see Figs. 4 and 5). Thus, this shows that beside its involvement in the stimulation of transcriptional activity, O-glycosylation of Sp1 may play a key role in its translocation. Interestingly, such a role of O-glycosylation of Sp1 has been reported very recently in a study of the effect of insulin in liver cells (45Majumdar G. Harmon A. Candelaria R. Martinez-Hernandez A. Raghow R. Solomon S.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E584-E591Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Moreover, it also should be underlined that O-glycosylation of Sp1 was reported to prevent its degradation (34Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Concerning the hexosamine pathway, glutamine acts through the reaction catalyzed by GFAT; and it must be remembered that GFAT requires two substrates, namely fructose 6-phosphate and glutamine. Although this pathway was reported to mediate many of the effects of high glucose level via the synthesis of fructose 6-phosphate (26Goldberg H.J. Scholey J. Fantus I.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 863-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 40Du W.L. Edelstein D. Rossetti L. Fantus I.G. Goldberg H. Ziyadeh F. Wu J. Brownlee M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the importance of glutamine has been neglected until now. Indeed, to our knowledge, the involvement of the hexosamine pathway in the effect of glutamine has not been studied on gene expression. Moreover, we observed that glutamine addition in a glucose-deprived medium remained without any effect on either Sp1 binding or ASS gene expression in Caco-2 cells; conversely, it was very recently reported that glucose addition to a glutamine-deprived medium exerted only a slight stimulatory effect on gene expression in cultured adipocytes (47Rumberger J.M. Wu T. Hering M.A. Marshall S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28547-28552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results therefore underline the importance of glutamine in the regulation of gene expression through the hexosamine pathway."

Recently, we reported on a C5a mutant, jun/fos-A8, as a potent antagonist for the human and mouse C5a receptor (CD88).

CD88 belongs to the large group of seven-transmembrane receptors that signal through both G protein-dependent and -independent pathways (11.Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 368-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). CD88 is able to bind two different classes of G proteins: the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gαi and the pertussis toxin-insensitive Gα16 subunits. Many but not all of the proinflammatory properties of C5a are sensitive to pertussis toxin treatment (1.Ember J.A. Jagels M.A. Hugli T.E. Volanakis J.E. Frank M.M. The Human Complement System in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1998: 241-284Crossref Google Scholar). Genetic deletion of CD88 protects mice from development of immune complex diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (12.Ji H. Ohmura K. Mahmood U. Lee D.M. Hofhuis F.M. Boackle S.A. Takahashi K.

Interestingly, CD88 deficiency failed to protect against experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (15.Reiman R. Gerard C. Campbell I.L. Barnum S.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1157-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggesting that in addition to CD88, C5a may signal through other receptors.Recently, a second C5aR was cloned, C5L2, which also belongs to the family of seven-transmembrane receptors (16.Ohno M.

Lynch K.R. O'Dowd B.F. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 86: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast to CD88, C5L2 binds both C5a and C5adesArg74 with high affinity, is uncoupled from G proteins, and lacks receptor internalization (18.Cain S.A. Monk P.N. J. Biol.

The missing G protein coupling of C5L2 suggests that this receptor may signal through G protein-independent pathways (11.Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Trends Pharmacol.

In addition, Arg74 is deleted. Further, parts of the leucine zipper of transcription factor fos are fused N-terminally to A8, forming a heterodimer with parts of the leucine zipper of transcription factor jun, resulting in jun/fos-C5aC27A-(1–66)-FKRSLLR.We assessed the molecular mechanism that renders jun/fos-A8 a C5aRA by site-directed mutagenesis. Our results provide evidence that position 69 is crucial for CD88 antagonism, whereas both the N-terminal jun/fos moieties and the three C-terminal residues 71–73 are not. Further, we demonstrate that jun/fos-A8 and the deletion mutant A8Δ71–73 are potent inhibitors of C5a and C5adesArg74 binding to C5L2, whereas the peptidic CD88 antagonist AcF-(OPdChaWR) is not. In addition, we present data that CD88 and C5L2 are coexpressed on human monocytes and the human mast cell line HMC-1 but that PMN exclusively express CD88.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of C5a Mutants—The C5a mutants depicted in Table I were constructed by PCR using the pJuFo-Δ pIII-A8 mutant as template (25.Heller T. Hennecke M. Baumann U. Gessner J.E. zu Vilsendorf A.M. Baensch M. Boulay F. Kola A. Klos A. Bautsch W. Köhl J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 985-994PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain fos-C5aC27A-(1–66)-FKRSLLR (fos-A8), the jun cassette was deleted by digesting the vector with XhoI and BamHI with 15 units/μg DNA at 37 °C for 1 h. The digested, linearized vector fragment was run on an agarose gel, and a band at the expected size was cut out and purified using glass milk beads. The purified fragment was religated. The 50-μl ligation reaction included 200 ng of digested vector and was incubated overnight at 15 °C with 640 units of T4-DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) to yield the new vector fragment, pFo-ΔpIII-A8.

This vector (pΔJuFo-ΔpIII-A8=pA8B) was then used as a template to construct all other C5a mutants. The primer combinations depicted in Table I were used to generate the different A8 mutants.PCRs were performed in 100-μl volumes containing 10 pg of template DNA pA8B, 200 μm of each dNTP, 20 pmol of each primer, and reaction buffer supplied by the manufacturer (Stratagene). The reaction mixtures were overlaid with mineral oil and kept at 94 °C for 5 min (hot start) in a thermocycler. After adding 5 units of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), the mixtures were cycled 30 times (94 °C for 90 s, 52 °C for 120 s, and 72 °C for 120 s), followed by incubation at 72 °C for 10 min.After phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA fragments were digested with SacI and KpnI (New England Biolabs) using 60 units/μg DNA at 37 °C for 1 h. The ligation mix was heat inactivated at 70 °C for 30 min, purified by phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, followed by resuspension in 5 μl of TE (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA). Two portions of 2.5 μl each were electroporated into Escherichia coli TG1 cells (Stratagene) using a Bio-Rad pulser set at 25 microfarads, 2.5 kV, and 200 Ω. Immediately after the pulse, 1 ml of freshly prepared SOC medium (0.5% yeast extract, 2% Tryptone, 10 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm MgSO4, 20 mm glucose) was added, and the cells were grown for 1 h at 37 °C and plated on TYE plates (15 g/liter Bacto agar, 10 g/liter Tryptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl) supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1% glucose (TYE+amp+gluc) as described (26.Hennecke M. Otto A. Baensch M. Kola A. Bautsch W. Klos A. Köhl J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To score the total number of independent transformants, 100 μl of appropriate dilutions were plated onto TYE+amp+gluc plates.Purification of C5a Mutants by Immune Affinity Chromatography— TG1 bacteria transfected with pA8 were grown in 2× TY+amp medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.1% glucose. At an A600 of 0.9, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to give a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Bacteria were grown overnight with shaking at room temperature. The next day, the periplasmic fraction was prepared by freezing and thawing as described (26.Hennecke M. Otto A. Baensch M. Kola A. Bautsch W. Klos A. Köhl J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was coated with C5a-specific mAb 561 (36.Klos A. Ihrig V. Messner M. Grabbe J. Bitter-Suermann D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 111: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A polyethylene-column (Biognosis) was loaded with 100 μl of gel matrix. The periplasmic fraction (400 μl diluted 1:5 with PBS) prepared from TG1 cells transformed with one of the C5a mutants was applied to the column for 1 h at 4 °C. The column was washed with 2 ml of PBS and subsequently loaded with a pre-elution buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8). Shifting the pH to 2.5 using 100 mm glycin/HCl buffer eluted the bound C5a mutant. Ten 50-μl aliquots were collected and subsequently tested in a dot-blot with mAb 561. Positive fractions were pooled. The concentration of purified C5a mutants was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Purified C5a mutants appeared as a single band after separation on 15% SDS-PAGE and subsequent silver staining (data not shown).Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay to Determine the Concentration of Purified C5a Mutants—The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed as described previously (36.Klos A. Ihrig V. Messner M. Grabbe J. Bitter-Suermann D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 111: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, anti-hC5a-specific mAb 561 was diluted to 10 μg/ml in PBS and was coated overnight at 22 °C to a polystyrene microtiter plate (Greiner). Then the plates were rinsed three times in PBS and saturated with PBS containing 2% non-fat dry milk for 60 min at 37 °C. After washing three times with 50 mm Tris buffer, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.5 (Tris), 50 μl of the purified C5a mutants diluted in Tris supplemented with 10% non-fat dry milk powder (Tris-milk) were added. After incubation for 90 min at 22 °C, the plates were washed four times with Tris and subsequently incubated with 50 μl of biotinylated anti C5a mAb 557 (10 μg/ml) diluted in Tris-milk for 90 min at 22 °C. The plates were washed four times with 50 mm Tris. Subsequently, 50 μl of avidin-alkaline-phosphatase diluted in Tris was added and incubated for 30 min at 22 °C. The plates were developed with p-nitrophenolphosphate (1 mg/ml diluted in diethanolamine, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 9).Competitive Binding Study—Competitive binding studies were performed as described previously (25.Heller T. Hennecke M. Baumann U. Gessner J.E. zu Vilsendorf A.M. Baensch M. Boulay F. Kola A. Klos A. Bautsch W. Köhl J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 985-994PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 μl of a reaction mixture containing a constant amount of 125I-rhC5a as tracer (0.1 nm; ≈17,000 cpm) and increasing concentrations of unlabeled C5a mutants were incubated in a microtiter plate on ice. The binding reaction was started by adding 25 μl of ice-cold CD88-transfected RBL-2H3 (CD88-RBL) cell suspension (37.Bock D. Martin U. Gartner S. Rheinheimer C. Raffetseder U. Arseniev L. Barker M.D. Monk P.N. Bautsch W. Köhl J. Klos A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1522-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After incubation on ice for 30 min, cell-bound and free 125I-rhC5a were separated by filtration of 60 μl through a microtitration membrane plate (Multiscreen™ HV; 0.45 μm, Millipore) using a vacuum manifold (Millipore). The wells were washed out once with 100 μl of HAG-CM buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mm glucose), dried by a heat lamp, and punched out with a membrane punch assembly. The punched out membranes were counted in a γ-counter (Packard). The plot of cell-bound 125I-rhC5a versus the concentration of unlabeled competitor yielded the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50).Cellular Activation and Inhibition Assays—The release of N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase from CD88-transfected RBL cells was determined as described (26.Hennecke M. Otto A. Baensch M. Kola A. Bautsch W. Klos A. Köhl J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The ED50 of rhC5a (Sigma-Aldrich) and C5a mutants was determined as the concentration leading to half-maximal enzyme release. The antagonistic potency of the different C5aRAs was tested as their ability to inhibit the release of N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase from CD88-transfected RBL cells induced by 10–9m C5a. Briefly, 75 μl/well of CD88-transfected RBL cells (2 × 106/ml) were suspended in HAG-CM buffer and equilibrated for 5 min at 37 °C. Meanwhile, 20 μl of serial dilutions of the purified C5a mutants were transferred to a microtiter plate (Greiner) and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. After 5 min of preincubation, cytochalasin B (20 μg/ml) was added to the cells and incubated for 3 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the cells were transferred to the C5aRA and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Then rhC5a was added at a final concentration of 10–9m, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by centrifugation at 1157 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, 75 μl of the supernatant were mixed with 100 μl of substrate (p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide). The reaction was stopped by adding 75 μl of glycine/NaOH, pH 10.4/well. The absorbance (405 nm) was determined in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. The ID50 of the C5a mutants was determined as the concentration leading to inhibition of half-maximal enzyme release induced by 10–9m rhC5a.Fluorescent Labeling of jun/fos-C5aAla27—jun/fos-C5aC27A was labeled with FLUOS (Roche Applied Science) at a molar ratio of 1:10 (ligand to FLUOS) for 1 h at room temperature according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Labeled ligand was separated from free FLUOS on a Sephadex G25 M column. As demonstrated previously, jun/fos-C5aC27A exhibits the same binding properties and functional potency as rhC5a (38.Hennecke M. Kola A. Baensch M. Wrede A. Klos A. Bautsch W. Köhl J.

https://openalex.org/W2054307809,"Drosophila suppressor of zeste 12 (Su(z)12) is a Polycomb group (PcG) transcriptional repressor and is present in E(z)-ESC, a multiprotein complex with methylation activity specific for lysine 9 and 27 of histone H3. Although PcG- and heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing have been considered distinct, mutant flies of Su(z)12 showed not only homeotic transformation but also position effect variegation. We now report that the mammalian SU(Z)12 directly interacts with heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1α) and PcG enhancer of zeste 2 (EZH2), the mammalian counterpart of E(z), in vitro and in vivo. Two distinct domains in SU(Z)12 are involved in these interactions, the region between the zinc finger motif and the VEFS (VRN2-EMF2-FIS2-Su(z)12) box for HP1α (amino acid residues 479–536) and the VEFS box for EZH2 (amino acid residues 600–639), which are not mutually exclusive. Interestingly this region of the VEFS box has been shown to be critical for the phenotype of the Su(z)12 mutant fly. In addition SU(Z)12 represses transcription activity in the presence of HP1α in a reporter assay.

Heterochromatin is the fraction of the genome that remains condensed throughout the cell cycle, replicates in the late S phase, and is generally associated with pericentric and telomeric regions of chromosomes (1.Elgin S.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 2.Henikoff S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1470: O1-O8PubMed Google Scholar). Euchromatic genes placed into proximity of heterochromatin by chromosomal rearrangement or trans-recruitment will be variably silenced, a phenomenon known as position effect variegation (PEV). 1The abbreviations used are: PEV, position effect variegation; EZH2, enhancer of zeste 2; GAL4DBD, Gal4 DNA binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; HP1, heterochromatin protein 1; PcG, Polycomb group; Su(var), suppressor of variegation; SU(Z)12, suppressor of zeste 12; VEFS, VRN2-EMF2-FIS2-Su(z)12; CAF1, chromatin assembly factor 1; SET, Su(var)3-9-E(z)-Trithorax; ESC, extra sex combs; EED, embryonic ectoderm development; TIF, transcriptional intermediatory factor; TAFII130, TATA-binding protein-associated factor, RNA polymerase II, 130 kDa; SUV39H1, suppressor of variegation 3–9 homolog 1. 1The abbreviations used are: PEV, position effect variegation; EZH2, enhancer of zeste 2; GAL4DBD, Gal4 DNA binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; HP1, heterochromatin protein 1; PcG, Polycomb group; Su(var), suppressor of variegation; SU(Z)12, suppressor of zeste 12; VEFS, VRN2-EMF2-FIS2-Su(z)12; CAF1, chromatin assembly factor 1; SET, Su(var)3-9-E(z)-Trithorax; ESC, extra sex combs; EED, embryonic ectoderm development; TIF, transcriptional intermediatory factor; TAFII130, TATA-binding protein-associated factor, RNA polymerase II, 130 kDa; SUV39H1, suppressor of variegation 3–9 homolog 1. Variegation is considered to be caused, in part, by spreading of heterochromatin components over euchromatic regions next to heterochromatin (3.Richards E.J. Elgin S.C. Cell. 2002; 108: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Genetic screens in Drosophila have identified dominant suppressors or enhancers of PEV, and an avenue to elucidate the molecular basis of PEV was attained (4.Reuter G. Wolff I. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 182: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 5.Sinclair D.A. Lloyd V.K. Grigliatti T.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A suppressor of variegation Su(var)2-5 and Su(var)3-9 encode proteins that are associated with heterochromatin. Recent studies revealed that Su(var)3-9 is a histone methyltransferase specific for lysine residue 9 of histone H3 (H3-K9) (6.Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar), thus creating a binding site on the nucleosome for Su(var)2-5, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) (7.Lachner M. O'Carroll D. Rea S. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar, 8.Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2001; 410: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar). Because Su(var)3-9 directly interacts with HP1, it is postulated that the Su(var)3-9-HP1 system plays an important role in initiation and/or maintenance of heterochromatin (3.Richards E.J. Elgin S.C. Cell. 2002; 108: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 9.Yamamoto K. Sonoda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Homeotic genes are spatially regulated during development, and maintenance of the transcriptional state of these genes is required for concerted action of the Polycomb (PcG) and Trithorax group proteins (10.Francis N.J. Kingston R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 11.Simon J.A. Tamkun J.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The PcG-mediated gene silencing has often been compared with the heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing because some conserved domains observed in PcG proteins are shared with HP1 (chromodomain) and Su(var)3-9 (chromodomain and Su(var)3–9, E(z) and Trithorax (SET) domain) and also because PcG proteins, like modifiers of PEV, are dosage-sensitive. However, PcG- and heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing require two distinct sets of protein. Su(var) mutants show no PcG phenotypes, and most PcG mutations do not suppress PEV except for enhancer of zeste (E(z)) and suppressor of zeste 12 (Su(z)12) (12.Laible G. Wolf A. Dorn R. Reuter G.

Rasmuson-Lestander A. Muller J. Development. 2001; 128: 3371-3379PubMed Google Scholar). Extra copies of E(z) or its human homologue EZH2 in transgenic flies enhanced PEV, and E(z) mutation weakly suppressed PEV (12.Laible G. Wolf A. Dorn R. Reuter G. Nislow C. Lebersorger A. Popkin D. Pillus L. Jenuwein T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3219-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). It was reported that the Su(z)12 mutant fly showed not only homeotic transformation but also suppression of PEV (13.Birve A. Sengupta A.K. Beuchle D. Larsson J. Kennison J.A. Rasmuson-Lestander A. Muller J. Development. 2001; 128: 3371-3379PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that molecular mechanisms underlying heterochromatin- and PcG-mediated gene silencing might, in part, be common; however, it has remained unclear whether effects on PEV of these genes are direct. PcG proteins are present in multiple protein complexes (10.Francis N.J. Kingston R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 11.Simon J.A. Tamkun J.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In Drosophila there are at least two characterized PcG complexes, a 2-MDa Polycomb repressive complex 1 and a 600-kDa or 1-MDa ESC-E(z) complex. The ESC-E(z) complex and its human counterpart, the EED-EZH2 complex, have been well characterized, and Su(z)12/SU(Z)12 was found to be a component of the ESC-E(z)/EED-EZH2 complex (14.Czermin B.

The purified ESC-E(z)/EED-EZH2 complex contains histone methyltransferase activity specific for H3-K9 and H3-K27, and this enzymatic activity depends on the SET domain of E(z)/EZH2. Evidence for the presence of Su(z)12 and E(z) in the same complex suggests that both are cooperatively involved in heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing as well as in PcG-mediated gene silencing. In attempts to elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in the dual functions of Su(z)12, we examined interactions between Su(z)12 and HP1 family proteins and found that SU(Z)12 directly interacts with HP1α in vitro and in vivo. SU(Z)12 showed trans-repression activity in the presence of HP1α in a reporter assay. In addition, EZH2 was isolated as a SU(Z)12-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening, and direct interaction was confirmed in vitro. The interaction sites were mapped to different regions in SU(Z)12, the region between the zinc finger and the VEFS (VRN2-EMF2-FIS2-Su(z)12) box and the VEFS box for HP1α and EZH2, respectively. Notably the carboxyl-terminal half of the VEFS box, the region reported to be critical for the phenotype of the Su(z)12 mutant, is essential for the interaction with EZH2. SU(Z)12-HP1α and SU(Z)12-EZH2 interactions are not mutually exclusive. Taken together, our findings suggest a role for SU(Z)12 in the maintenance of heterochromatin- and/or HP1-mediated transcriptional repression of euchromatic genes by recruiting EZH2 or EED-EZH2 complex onto HP1α-bound nucleosomes. Plasmid Constructs—Details on individual plasmid constructs, which were all verified by sequencing, are available upon request. Mouse cDNAs of HP1α/β/γ and EZH2 were cloned by PCR from mouse thymocyte and embryo cDNAs, respectively. Human cDNA of SU(Z)12 was generously provided by Kazusa Research Institute (Kazusa, Saitama, Japan). The 165I/Y168 mutant of mouse HP1α was as described previously (9.Yamamoto K. Sonoda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For in vitro binding assays, the indicated cDNAs were fused to GST in pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences). For in vitro coupled transcription/translation, the indicated cDNAs were fused to HA tag in pGAD-T7 vector (Clontech). Constructs for mammalian transfection were based on pCMV-HA and pCMV-myc (Clontech) to express HA- and Myc-tagged proteins. The cDNA of HP1α was subcloned into pG4MpolyII (19.Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 447-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar) (a gift from R. Losson and P. Chambon, Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Strasbourg, France) for GAL4DBD fusion in a reporter assay. Four repeats of GAL4DBD binding sequence (17m4) were inserted into SacI and BglII sites of pGL3-pro (Promega) to generate a reporter plasmid (pGL3–17m4-pro) for luciferase assay. For yeast two-hybrid screening, the indicated cDNA of SU(Z)12 was fused to GAL4DBD in pGBK-T7 vector (Clontech). In Vitro Binding Assays—Preparation of GST fusion proteins and GST pull-down experiments were done as described previously (9.Yamamoto K. Sonoda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In vitro translated proteins were prepared using the TnT quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. In brief, approximately 10 μg of the indicated GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose was incubated with 10 μlof in vitro translated proteins in 100 μl of GST pull-down buffer (GPB; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with GPB, and the bound proteins were eluted with 2× SDS sample buffer by boiling for 10 min. For the peptide competition assay, various amounts of wild type (KVPVVVLEDILAT) or mutant (KVAVAVAEDILAT) peptides derived from the mouse the p150 subunit of chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF1) (amino acids 220–232) were added to the binding reaction. Proteins were separated by 5–20% gradient SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and Western blots were prepared using an anti-HA tag monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a standard protocol. Transient Transfection and Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of the indicated plasmids using a standard calcium phosphate method. After 60 h, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). MgCl2 and RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science) were added to final concentrations of 5 mm and 100 units/ml, respectively, and cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, the resulting whole cell extracts were transferred into new tubes and incubated with 10 μl of anti-Myc monoclonal antibody-coupled protein G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with cold RIPA buffer, and final pellets were resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates were separated by 5–20% gradient SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and Western blots were prepared using an anti-HA or anti-Myc tag monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a standard protocol. To examine the co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous SU(Z)12 with HP1α, HeLa cells were transfected with 10 μg of pCMV-myc-HP1α or vector alone, and nuclei were prepared in buffer N as described previously (20.Remboutsika E. Lutz Y. Gansmuller A. Vonesch J.L. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1671-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) after 60 h of transfection. Nuclei were treated with RNase-free DNase I at 100 units/ml for 1 h at 4 °C, and then NaCl and glycerol were added to a final concentration of 450 mm and 25%, respectively. Nuclei were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, and nuclear extracts were obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The extracts were incubated with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody-coupled protein G beads, and the following steps were done as described above but using an anti-SU(Z)12 polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) for the Western blots. Immunofluorescent Staining—Twenty-four hours after co-transfection with HA-tagged HP1α and Myc-tagged SU(Z)12, COS-7 cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. After blocking with 1.4% milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% saponin, cells were incubated with anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) or anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% saponin for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rat IgG (highly cross-adsorbed) and Alexa Fluor 546 anti-mouse IgG (highly cross-adsorbed) (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:2000 for 1 h at room temperature. For counterstaining of nucleic acid using propidium iodide (Molecular Probes), cells were incubated with 100 μg/ml DNase-free RNase in 2× SSC (0.3 m NaCl, 0.03 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) followed by incubation with a 500 nm solution of propidium iodide for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were covered with a drop of Gel/Mount (Biomeda) and viewed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Fluoview FV500). Luciferase Assay—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of pGL3–17m4-pro reporter, 1 μg of phRL-CMV as an internal control, and the indicated amounts of pG4M-polyII (expressing GAL4DBD), pG4M-polyII-HP1α (expressing GAL4DBD-HP1α), pCMV-myc, and pCMV-myc-SU(Z)12. All samples contained the same amount of pG4M-polyII- and pCMV-derived plasmids. Cells were harvested 36 h posttransfection, and preparation of cell extracts and luciferase assay were done using the Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system (Promega) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The reporter activities were normalized to internal control (Renilla luciferase activities), and relative luciferase activities were expressed relative to the activity in the presence of unfused GAL4DBD expression vector and pCMV. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast two-hybrid screening was done using MATCHMAKER GAL4 Two-Hybrid System 3 kits and pretransformed MATCHMAKER cDNA Library (Clontech) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. cDNA corresponding to the amino acid residues 403–739 of SU(Z)12 was fused to the GAL4DBD in pGBK vector (TRP1) as bait and introduced into the yeast AH109 strain containing integrated His3 and Ade2 reporters driven by GAL1- and GAL2-UAS, respectively, by the standard lithium acetate method. A mouse embryonic cDNA library fused to GAL4 transactivating domain in pACT2 vector (LEU2) that was pretransformed in the yeast strain Y187 was used for the screening. Approximately 2 × 108 independent transformants were spread on the culture plate with selection medium (adenine-, His-, Leu-, and Trp-) containing 20 μg/ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-galactopyranoside (X-α-gal) for double selection. Positive blue colonies were spread on selection plates, and the plasmids were extracted using YEASTMAKER™ yeast plasmid isolation kits (Clontech). Each plasmid was introduced into Escherichia coli for amplification, purified, and then sequenced to identify the inserted cDNA. Interaction between SU(Z)12 and HP1 Family Proteins in Vitro and in Vivo—HP1 is an abundant component of heterochromatin, and genetic and biochemical analyses demonstrated that this molecule plays a key role in heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing (3.Richards E.J. Elgin S.C. Cell. 2002; 108: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). As HP1 associates with various transcription regulatory proteins, we examined the interactions with SU(Z)12. The mammalian HP1 family is composed of three closely related proteins, HP1α, HP1β, and HP1γ (21.Nielsen A.L. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Ortiz J.A. Remboutsika E. Chambon P. Losson R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We introduced Myc-tagged full-length SU(Z)12 into COS-7 cells by transient transfection together with HA-tagged full-length mouse HP1α, HP1β, or HP1γ, and a co-immunoprecipitation experiment was done. HP1α but not HP1β or HP1γ was coimmunoprecipitated with SU(Z)12 (Fig. 1A). The association was further examined using endogenous materials. When nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa cells that were transfected with Myc-tagged HP1α and immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the presence of endogenous SU(Z)12, it was evident that endogenous SU(Z)12 was co-immunoprecipitated with HP1α (Fig. 1B). Previous immunostaining studies have shown a spatially distinct localization pattern for each of the HP1s (21.Nielsen A.L. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Ortiz J.A. Remboutsika E. Chambon P. Losson R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). While HP1α is found in heterochromatin, HP1β localizes to both heterochromatin and euchromatin, and HP1γ localizes mostly to euchromatin. Consistent with the data from the co-immunoprecipitation experiment, our immunostaining showed that SU(Z)12 is a nuclear protein, and its subnuclear distribution pattern closely matches that of HP1α in transfected cells (Fig. 1C). Thus, an association between SU(Z)12 and HP1α in cells was revealed. To examine direct interactions, SU(Z)12 proteins were produced by in vitro coupled transcription/translation, and GST pull-down experiments were done using GST fusion full-length HP1α, HP1β, and HP1γ (Fig. 2A). Interestingly full-length SU(Z)12 bound to HP1α and HP1γ but not to HP1β in vitro. The amount of pulled down SU(Z)12 by HP1γ was higher than that by HP1α, whereas an almost equal amount of control HP1α was pulled down. Despite a structural similarity, HP1 family proteins showed a selective molecular interaction with some proteins in vitro. Histone H1 and brahma-related gene I (BRGI) preferentially interact with HP1α (21.Nielsen A.L. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Ortiz J.A. Remboutsika E. Chambon P. Losson R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 22.Nielsen A.L. Sanchez C. Ichinose H. Cervino M. Lerouge T. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5797-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), whereas TAFII130 interacts with HP1α and HP1γ but not with HP1β (23.Vassallo M.F. Tanese N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5919-5924Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). SU(Z)12 exhibited the same specificity as TAFII130 in vitro (see below). To search for the interaction site in SU(Z)12, three deletion mutants were generated, and in vitro binding assays were done. Because there are two distinct domains in SU(Z)12, a single C2H2 type of zinc finger and a VEFS box whose functions were unclear (13.Birve A. Sengupta A.K. Beuchle D. Larsson J. Kennison J.A. Rasmuson-Lestander A. Muller J. Development. 2001; 128: 3371-3379PubMed Google Scholar), constructs were designed to determine the domain responsible for the HP1 interaction. As shown in Fig. 2A, two truncated proteins, SU(Z)12-Z (amino acids 403–536) and SU(Z)12-C (amino acids 479–739), definitely bound to HP1α and HP1γ in vitro, indicating that the 58-amino acid stretch between the zinc finger motif and VEFS box (amino acids 479–536) is responsible for this interaction. The interaction of this small region with HP1α was confirmed (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the zinc finger motif and VEFS box may have functional roles other than HP1 interactions. Self-association of HP1α Is Required for Direct Interaction with SU(Z)12—The HP1 family proteins are one class of chromodomain proteins containing an amino-terminal chromodomain and a structurally related carboxyl-terminal chromo shadow domain linked by a poorly conserved hinge region, and several lines of evidence implicate these domains in HP1 functions (24.Eissenberg J.C.

Regarding protein-protein interaction, the chromodomain binds to methylated H3-K9 that is created by histone methyltransferases such as SUV39H1 (7.Lachner M. O'Carroll D. Rea S. Mechtler K.

In contrast to these domains, the chromo shadow domain can complex a variety of proteins including SUV39H1, Su(var)3-7, TIF1-α, TIF1-β, TAFII130, BRG1, CAF1p150, the nuclear autoantigen SP100, and the inner nuclear membrane protein lamin B receptor (9.Yamamoto K.

To identify the domains in HP1α responsible for direct interaction with SU(Z)12, several mutants of HP1α were generated as GST fusions, and GST pull-down experiments were done using in vitro translated SU(Z)12-C (Fig. 2B). Similar to most of the HP1-interacting proteins, SU(Z)12 interacts with the chromo shadow domain of HP1α. In addition, the IY165/168EE mutation in this domain, which abrogates dimerization of HP1α (9.Yamamoto K. Sonoda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 31.Brasher S.V. Smith B.O. Fogh R.H. Nietlispach D. Thiru A. Nielsen P.R. Broadhurst R.W. Ball L.J. Murzina N.V. Laue E.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1587-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), did not interact with SU(Z)12, hence self-interaction of HP1α is required for the interaction. Most proteins interacting with HP1 via this domain are characterized by conservation of a pentapeptide consensus sequence, PXVXL (32.Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), and peptide phage display experiments revealed that peptides of (P/L)(W/R/Y)V(M/I/L)(M/L/V) sequence can bind the chromo shadow domain (33.Smothers J.F. Henikoff S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 27-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In addition, the dimer formation via chromo shadow domains creates a molecular surface to which the pentapeptide motif can bind. Indeed a peptide containing this motif competes for interactions between HP1 and CAF1, TIF-1β, and SUV39H1 (9.Yamamoto K. Sonoda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 31.Brasher S.V. Smith B.O. Fogh R.H. Nietlispach D. Thiru A. Nielsen P.R. Broadhurst R.W. Ball L.J. Murzina N.V. Laue E.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1587-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). To determine whether interaction of SU(Z)12 with HP1α is in the same mode of protein-protein interaction as these proteins, a peptide competition assay for in vitro binding was done (Fig. 3). The direct interaction of SU(Z)12 was competed for by increasing the amount of the wild type CAF1p150-derived 13-mer peptide KVPVVVLEDILAT (consensus sequence is in bold) but not the mutant peptide KVAVAVAEDILAT where Pro, Val, and Val of the consensus are substituted for Ala (underlined). This result indicates that SU(Z)12 shares an interaction site formed by chromo shadow domain-mediated dimerization in HP1α with other HP1α-interacting proteins that contain the pentapeptide consensus. Differing from data obtained in previous studies, the pentapeptide consensus is absent in the HP1α-interacting site in SU(Z)12. We reported that the amino-terminal 39-amino acid stretch of SUV39H1 is sufficient for direct interaction with the chromo shadow domain of HP1α, which is also inhibited by the CAF1p150-derived peptide used in this study (9.Yamamoto K. Sonoda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The pentapeptide consensus is not found in this sequence of SUV39H1 as in the case of SU(Z)12, hence the binding sequence to dimerized HP1 chromo shadow domain is varied. The molecular basis of selective interaction of SU(Z)12 with HP1 family proteins in vitro is not clear. Histone H1 specifically interacts with HP1α via a poorly conserved hinge region (21.Nielsen A.L. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Ortiz J.A. Remboutsika E. Chambon P. Losson R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). BRG1 also exhibits HP1α-specific interaction, and the chromo shadow domain is involved (22.Nielsen A.L. Sanchez C. Ichinose H. Cervino M. Lerouge T. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5797-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, the amino acid residues in the chromo shadow domain critical for this interaction are not conserved among HP1 family, and mutation of these residues does not affect dimer formation. TAFII130 exhibits selective interaction with HP1α and HP1γ as does SU(Z)12 in vitro (23.Vassallo M.F. Tanese N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5919-5924Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). TAFII130 contains a pentapeptide consensus and interacts with the chromo shadow domain of HP1. It might be that amino acid residues located on the dimer surface formed by the chromo shadow domain, which are conserved between HP1α and HP1γ but not HP1β, are critical for interaction with SU(Z)12 and TAFII130. SU(Z)12 Represses Transcriptional Activity in the Presence of HP1α—The PcG and heterochromatin proteins are known to be involved in transcriptional repression. To investigate whether SU(Z)12 represses transcription via interacting with HP1, we measured transcriptional activity of SU(Z)12 in the presence of HP1 by transient transfection and a luciferase assay in COS-7 cells. The coding sequence of HP1α was fused to GAL4DBD, and reporter plasmid containing four GAL4DBD-binding sites upstream of SV40 promoter was constructed (Fig. 4A). We initially examined the effects of GAL4DBD-HP1α on reporter activity and found that HP1α repressed transcription in a dosedependent manner as described before (data not shown) (32.Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Various amounts of SU(Z)12 were co-transfected with GAL4DBD or GAL4DBD-HP1α in a condition where GAL4DBD-HP1α moderately repressed reporter activity (0.2 μg). In the absence of GAL4DBD-HP1α, SU(Z)12 did not show any effects on transcription activity of reporter gene (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–3). The GAL4DBD-HP1α repressed luciferase activity to ∼43% (compare lanes 1 and 4). When SU(Z)12 was expressed together with GAL4DBD-HP1α, it was evident that the levels of repression were enhanced in a dose-dependent manner (compare lane 4 (43%), lane 5 (27%), and lane 6 (15%)). Thus, these results suggest that SU(Z)12 can repress transcription when targeted to a reporter gene by HP1α. We also examined whether SU(Z)12 represses transcription when directly targeted to a reporter by GAL4DBD fusion; however, it did not show any effect (data not shown). It might be possible that the GAL4 fusion masked a portion of SU(Z)12 that is involved in repression function and could not repress the SV40 promoter or that SU(Z)12 cooperates with other factors that are recruited to the promoter by HP1α in the repression of reporter activity. SU(Z)12 Interacts with EZH2 in Vitro and in Vivo—To gain further insight into the interaction between SU(Z)12 and HP1α, proteins that might be recruited to HP1α-bound nucleosomes via interacting with SU(Z)12 were searched for by doing yeast two-hybrid screening. cDNA corresponding to amino acid residues 403–739 of SU(Z)12 was fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain and served as bait (Fig. 5A). This region was selected because it contains two functionally unknown structures, a zinc finger motif and a VEFS box, that could be a module of protein-protein interactions. A mouse embryonic library was screened, and two clones encoding amino acid residues 238–746 of mouse EZH2 were isolated (Fig. 5A). The interaction between SU(Z)12 and EZH2 in mammalian cells was confirmed in co-immunoprecipitation experiments using transiently transfected COS-7 cells with Myc-tagged fulllength SU(Z)12 and HA-tagged full-length mouse EZH2 (Fig. 5B). To identify the interaction site in SU(Z)12 with EZH2, deletion mutants of SU(Z)12 were generated as GST fusion proteins, and in vitro binding assays were done (Fig. 5C). We found that EZH2 interacts with the VEFS box of SU(Z)12 (lanes 4, 5, and 7), the region distinct from the HP1α interaction site. In addition, the region of amino acid residues 600–639 in the VEFS box was found to be critical for this interaction (compare lanes 5 and 6). An isoleucine at position 600 in the VEFS box (Fig. 5C, upper panel, black triangle) is conserved between Drosophila and human, and a previous genetic study reported that the mutant fly showing suppression of PEV has a P-element insertion into this position (13.Birve A. Sengupta A.K. Beuchle D. Larsson J. Kennison J.A. Rasmuson-Lestander A. Muller J. Development. 2001; 128: 3371-3379PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the possible molecular mechanism of the phenotype of this strain would be that the truncated Su(z) protein, which can interact with HP1α or other targets but not with E(z), competes with wild-type Su(z)12 protein for interacting with HP1α or other targets, but it does not function. Because the binding sites in SU(Z)12 for HP1α and EZH2 were mapped to distinct regions, it was expected that SU(Z)12 can link between HP1α and EZH2 by physical interactions. To examine this possibility, full-length HA-HP1α, HA-SU(Z)12, and Myc-EZH2 were co-expressed in COS-7 cells, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were done using an anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 6A, both SU(Z)12 and HP1α were co-immunoprecipitated with EZH2 (lane 5). In contrast, HP1α was not coimmunoprecipitated with EZH2 in the absence of SU(Z)12 (lane 3). Interaction between HP1α and SU(Z)12 was nil in the GST pull-down experiment using full-length GST-HP1α and in vitro translated full-length EZH2 (data not shown). Thus, HP1α-SU(Z)12 and SU(Z)12-EZH2 interactions are not mutually exclusive, and SU(Z)12 may recruit EZH2 to HP1α-bound nucleosomes (Fig. 6B). The results presented here implicate each of SU(Z)12 and EZH2 in heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing. SU(Z)12 may bridge EZH2 histone methyltransferase to the HP1-coated nucleosomes to methylate H3-K9, thus providing a binding site for HP1 as in the SUV39H1-HP1 system. We do not know whether these systems additively or exclusively function in heterochromatin maintenance in cell. According to a study analyzing Suv39h-deficient cells, H3-K9 methylation at pericentric heterochromatin specifically depends on this histone methyltransferase (34.Peters A.H. O'Carroll D. Scherthan H. Mechtler K. Sauer S. Schofer C. Weipoltshammer K. Pagani M. Lachner M. Kohlmaier A. Opravil S. Doyle M. Sibilia M. Jenuwein T. Cell. 2001; 107: 323-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar), hence the HP1-SU(Z)12-EZH2 system may function at a non-pericentric heterochromatin. Alternatively this system may function at a particular stage during cell differentiation because expression of EZH2 is up-regulated in lymphocytes in a proliferation status (35.Raaphorst F.M. Otte A.P. van Kemenade F.J. Blokzijl T. Fieret E. Hamer K.M. Satijn D.P. Meijer C.J. J.

The results presented here also suggest that HP1-SU(Z)12-EZH2 might be involved in the euchromatic gene repression mediated by HP1 (37.Nielsen S.J. Schneider R. Bauer U.M. Bannister A.J. Morrison A.

https://openalex.org/W1996271220,"We assessed the contribution of the cellular prion protein (PrPc) in the control of neuronal apoptosis by examining cell death in both human cells and murine primary cultured neurons. We first confirmed our previous finding that staurosporine-induced caspase activation is increased by PrPc overexpression in HEK293 cells. We show here that this phenotype is fully dependent on p53 and that the control of p53 activity by PrPc occurs at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in human cells. Of most interest, we demonstrate that neuronal endogenous PrPc also controls a p53-dependent pro-apoptotic phenotype. Thus, DNA fragmentation and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling)-positive cells were lower in primary cultured neurons derived from Zrch-1 mice embryos in which PrPc has been abrogated than in wild-type neurons. PrPc knock-out neurons also displayed drastically diminished caspase-3-like activity and immunoreactivity together with reduced p53 expression and transcriptional activity, a phenotype complemented in part by PrPc transfection. Interestingly, p53 expression was also reduced in the brain of adult Prnp-/- mice. Neuronal PrPc likely controls p53 at a post-transcriptional level because the deletion of cellular prion protein is accompanied by a higher Mdm2-like immunoreactivity and reduced phosphorylated p38 MAPK expression. We therefore propose that the physiological function of endogenous cellular prion could be to regulate p53-dependent caspase-3-mediated neuronal cell death. This phenotype likely occurs through up-regulation of p53 promoter transactivation as well as downstream by controlling p53 stability via Mdm2 expression.

This phenotype likely occurs through up-regulation of p53 promoter transactivation as well as downstream by controlling p53 stability via Mdm2 expression. Prion-related pathologies are now better understood as diseases that can be of either sporadic or infectious origin but always have a fatal outcome (1.Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5101) Google Scholar, 2.Aguzzi A. Montrasio F. Kaeser P.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These pathologies are not conventional, first because they appear to be caused mainly by a unique protein that bears the potential of transmissibility in infectious cases of these diseases. It is now widely admitted that transmission occurs independently of any accompanying nucleic acid or viral particles (1.Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5101) Google Scholar, 3.Weissmann C. Enari M. Klöhn P.-C. Rossi D. Flechsig E. Acta Neurobiol. Exp. 2002; 62: 153-166PubMed Google Scholar). Second, and of most interest, was the demonstration that the scrapie (also called PrPres) 1The abbreviations used are: PrP, prion protein; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; HEK293 cells, human embryonic kidney cells; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: PrP, prion protein; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; HEK293 cells, human embryonic kidney cells; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. is the highly protease-resistant conformer of a ubiquitous protein counterpart referred to as cellular prion protein (PrPc) (4.Prusiner S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 482-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 5.Ghetti B. Piccardo P. Frangione B. Bugiani O. Giaccone G. Young K. Prelli F. Farlow M.R. Dlouhy S.R. Tagliavni F. Brain Pathol. 1996; 6: 127-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Another striking aspect is that the host PrPc seems to act as a “substratum” for scrapie as demonstrated by the fact that in animals deficient in endogenous PrPc, highly infectious “scrapie-rich” inoculates fail to transmit the disease (6.Büeler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar, 7.Brandner S. Isenmann S. Raeber A. Fischer M. Sailer A. Kobayashi Y. Marino S. Weissmann C. Aguzzi A. Nature. 1996; 379: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). This observation is not fully understood at a molecular level, and the mechanisms by which PrPc is converted into scrapie remain a matter of speculation. Furthermore, this does not explain most of the sporadic cases that are characterized at late stages by spontaneous deposition of PrPres in the absence of exogenous “pathogenic” species. Some clues to further understand PrP-related pathologies might come from a better knowledge of PrPc physiology and putative dysfunctions responsible for the disease. In this respect, an interesting discussion revolving around cell death is ongoing, opening a new field of investigation. It is clear that apoptosis accompanies the late stages of the disease. Following that idea, several groups have set out to investigate the putative role of PrPc in the control of cell death. From a theoretical point of view, PrP could be antiapoptotic, and the disease could result in the abolition of this function. Alternatively, PrPc-related pathologies could be due to the exacerbation of a proapoptotic physiological phenotype associated with PrPc. Studies carried out on distinct cell types, with various methodologies and approaches, have led to somewhat opposite conclusions (8.Kuwahara C. Takeuchi A.M. Nishimura T. Haraguchi K. Kubosaki A.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that overexpression of PrPc in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) and TSM1 neurons as well as in an inducible cell line (Rov9) leads to increased susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli, reflected mainly by enhanced caspase-3 activity (13.Paitel E. Alves da Costa C. Vilette D. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1208-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14.Paitel E. Fahraeus R. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10061-10066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that in TSM1 neurons, PrPc-induced caspase-3 activation is associated with an up-regulation of p53 expression and transcriptional activity (14.Paitel E. Fahraeus R. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10061-10066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This appears to be due to Mdm2-related post-transcriptional modification of p53 (14.Paitel E. Fahraeus R. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10061-10066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the present study, we first establish that in HEK293, PrPc-related increased cell death is fully dependent on p53 activity. Moreover, we demonstrate that p53 deletion in fibroblasts fully abolishes both PrPc-induced caspase-3 and p53 transcriptional activities. We also show that in addition to our previously described post-transcriptional control of p53 (14.Paitel E. Fahraeus R. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10061-10066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), PrPc also enhances the transactivation of the p53 promoter. Because our TSM1 neurons stably overexpressed PrPc, it was also important to confirm the p53-dependent function of endogenous PrPc. We therefore examined the physiological contribution of cellular PrPc to the control of neuronal cell death by comparing primary cultured neurons derived from mice harboring (Prnp+/+) or devoid (Prnp-/-, Zrch-1 mice (15.Bueler H. Fischer M. Lang Y. Bluethmann H. Lipp H. DeArmond S. Prusiner S.B. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Nature. 1992; 356: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar)) of endogenous PrPc. We show that neurons derived from Zrch-1 mice embryos are less sensitive to staurosporine and display lower DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 and p53 activities and expression, and higher Mdm2-like immunoreactivity. We demonstrate that endogenous PrPc controls neuronal cell death via Mdm2-regulated p53-dependent caspase-3 activation in non-immortalized neurons. Primary Cultured Neurons, 3F4-HEK293 Cells, and p53-deficient Fibroblasts—Primary cultured neurons were prepared from the cerebral hemispheres of 14-day-old PrPc+/+ or PrPc-/-mouse embryos as described (16.Vincent B. Beaudet A. Dauch P. Vincent J.P. Checler F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5049-5059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were mechanically dissociated with a pipette in Ham's F12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.6% glucose. Dissociated cells were then plated at a density of 106 cells in 35-mm dishes pre-coated with 10 μg/ml polylysine (Sigma) and grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Transfection of 3F4-PrPc in primary cultured neurons was performed with Superfect (Qiagen). 3F4-HEK293 cells have been described previously (13.Paitel E. Alves da Costa C. Vilette D. Grassi J.

Western Blot Analyses—Cells were scraped and homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). Equal amounts of protein (50 μg) determined by the Bradford method (19.Bradford M.M. Anal.

Flow Cytometry and TUNEL Analysis—Cells were grown in 6-well plates and incubated for 15 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of staurosporine (0.5 μm, Sigma) and then rinsed with PBS and suspended with 750 μl of buffer (Tris 20 mm, tri-natrium citrate 0.1%, Triton X-100 0.05%) containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. Cells were left overnight at 4 °C, and then the propidium iodide fluorescence of individual nuclei was measured as described previously (14.Paitel E. Fahraeus R. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10061-10066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For DNA nick-end labeling, cells were fixed for 20 min in 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, left overnight in 70% ethanol, and then processed for the dUTP nick-end labeling TUNEL technique according to manufacturer's recommendations (kit from Roche Applied Science). Staining was assessed with a peroxidase-conjugated antibody and revealed with a diaminobenzidine substrate. Caspase-3-like Activity Assay—Cells were cultured in 6-well plates for 15 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of staurosporine (0.5 μm) (in some cases, cells were preincubated for 24 h with Ac-DEVD-al (100 μm)). Cells were then rinsed, gently scraped, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 40 μl of lysis buffer, and analyzed as detailed previously (22.Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). p53 Transcriptional Activity and Its Promoter Transactivation—One μg of PG13-luciferase, a p53 gene reporter construct described previously (23.El-Deiry W. Kern S. Pietenpol J. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar), was co-transfected with 1 μg of a β-galactosidase coding vector (to normalize transfections efficiencies) in 3F4-PrPc HEK293 cells, PrP+/+, or PrP-/- primary cultured neurons. Forty-eight hours after transfection, luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured according to previously described procedures (23.El-Deiry W. Kern S. Pietenpol J. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). Mouse p53 promoter was cloned as described (24.Ginsberg D. Oren M. Yaniv M. Piette J. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1285-1290PubMed Google Scholar) except that the same p53 promoter region was cloned upstream of luciferase instead of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. The same construct lacking the p53 sequence was used as control. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed with Prism software (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA) using the Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test for one-way analysis of variance and the unpaired Student's t test for pairwise comparisons. PrPc-induced Apoptotic Phenotype Is Fully Dependent on p53 in Human Cells and Fibroblasts—We have established previously that PrPc drastically potentiates staurosporine-induced caspase activation in neuronal TSM1 cells (14.Paitel E. Fahraeus R. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10061-10066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This phenotype is antagonized by the depletion of endogenous p53 by using an antisense approach (14.Paitel E. Fahraeus R. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10061-10066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Using a pharmacological approach, we have established here that a very potent and selective p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-α, completely abolishes p53 transcriptional activity in human HEK293 cells (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, pifithrin-α but not its inactive analog (Fig. 1A) fully inhibits the PrPc-dependent increase of staurosporine-induced caspase activation. We previously documented the fact that PrPc increases p38-like immunoreactivity and controls Mdm2-dependent p53 metabolic stability in TSM1 cells (14.Paitel E. Fahraeus R. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10061-10066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Here we show that besides this post-transcriptional effect, PrPc also exerts transcriptional control of p53. Thus, 3F4-HEK293 cells display a significantly higher p53 promoter transactivation than mock-transfected cells as indicated by the luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 2). We have previously established a link between p53 and the PrPc-induced phenotype using fibroblasts in which the p53 gene harbors a loss-of-function mutation. To confirm this finding and preclude the possibility of a refolding/restoration of p53 activity after the chaperoning of mutated p53 (25.Bykov V.J.N. Issaeva N. Shilov A. Hultcrantz M. Pugacheva E. Chumakov P. Wiman K. Selivanova G. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar), we have now switched to a fibroblastic cell line in which p53 has been invalidated and examined the phenotype triggered by overexpression of PrPc. In the absence of p53, there is an important staurosporine-induced caspase-3 activation (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, this p53-independent caspase activity was not enhanced by PrPc (Fig. 3B), whereas the combination of PrPc expression and p53 complementation led to an additional increase of caspase-3 activity (Fig. 3B). Finally, the co-transfection of PrPc with p53 cDNA drastically potentiated the p53 transcriptional activity exhibited by p53 cDNA transfection alone (Fig. 3A). Altogether, these data, combined with those observed after pifithrin-α inhibition, clearly indicate that the PrPc proapoptotic phenotype is completely dependent on p53 and that the latter is controlled by PrPc at both the transcriptional (Fig. 2) and post-transcriptional (14.Paitel E. Fahraeus R. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10061-10066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) levels in human and neuronal cells. PrP-/-Primary Cultured Neurons Display Lower Susceptibility to Staurosporine—Our previous statements above were based on several cell lines overexpressing PrPc. It was therefore important to assess the contribution of endogenous PrPc. We thus measured the staurosporine susceptibility of primary cultured neurons from Zrch-1 mice embryos in which the Prnp gene had been disrupted (15.Bueler H. Fischer M. Lang Y. Bluethmann H. Lipp H. DeArmond S. Prusiner S.B. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Nature. 1992; 356: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). As expected, these neurons do not display any PrPc-like immunoreactivity (Fig. 4A). That PrP-/- neurons exhibit lower staurosporine-induced responses is evidenced by both TUNEL (Fig. 4, B and C) and DNA fragmentation (Table I) analyses. Clearly, the staurosporine-induced increase in the number of apoptotic nuclei observed in PrP+/+ neurons is drastically lowered in neurons devoid of PrPc (Fig. 4, B and C). This lower staurosporine susceptibility exhibited by PrP-/- primary cultured neurons is accompanied by lowered caspase-3-like immunoreactivity (Fig. 5A) and activity (Fig. 5B). It is noteworthy that the effect of staurosporine is dose-dependent in both PrP+/+ and PrP-/- cells, as was another apoptotic effector, ceramide C2 (Fig. 5, C and D). However, the effect triggered by both pharmacological agents always remains lower in PrP-/- neurons than in PrP+/+ neurons.Table IBasal and staurosporine-stimulated propidium iodide incorporation measured in the indicated cell lines by flow cytometry analysisNumber of nucleiaThe number of apoptotic nuclei is estimated as described under “Materials and Methods.”PrP+/+PrP−/−%Basal33.824.3Staurosporine66.732.1a The number of apoptotic nuclei is estimated as described under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab Fig. 5Depletion of endogenous PrPc lowers the responsiveness of primary cultured neurons to staurosporine and ceramide C2. Primary cultured neurons were obtained from 14-day-old mouse embryos from wild-type mice (PrP+/+) or Zrch-1 mice in which the Prnp gene had been deleted (PrP-/-) and cultured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Caspase-3-like immunoreactivity (A) and activity (B) were measured in the indicated cell lines in control (-) and staurosporine (Sts)-stimulated (+) conditions. The bars in B correspond to the Ac-DEVD-al-sensitive Ac-DEVD-7AMC hydrolyzing activity and are the means ± S.E. of four experiments (duplicate determinations). C and D, PrP+/+ and PrP-/- cultured neurons were incubated with increasing concentrations of staurosporine (C) or ceramide C2 (D), and then caspase-3 was measured as described. The bars show the percent of control corresponding to caspase activity recovered in untreated PrP-/- neurons and represent the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PrPc Complementation Partially Restores Staurosporine-induced Caspase-3 Activation in PrP-/-Primary Cultured Neurons—Transient transfection of PrP+/+ neurons with 3F4MoPrPc cDNA led to enhanced PrPc-like immunoreactivity (Fig. 6A, upper panel). The treatment of mock-transfected PrP+/+ neurons with staurosporine increases caspase-3-like immunoreactivity, a phenotype that was drastically enhanced in 3F4MoPrPc-transfected primary cultured neurons (Fig. 6A, lower panel). Accordingly, this was accompanied by a consistent elevation of staurosporine-induced caspase activation upon 3F4MoPrP transfection of PrP+/+ neurons (Fig. 6B). These data indicate that primary cultured neurons were transfectable and that 3F4MoPrPc overexpression in these cells mimics and potentiates the staurosporine-stimulated caspase activation phenotype observed in untransfected primary cultured neurons (see Fig. 5). We took advantage of this feature to examine whether the lowering of caspase activation observed in PrP-/- primary cultured neurons could be rescued even partially by 3F4MoPrPc overexpression. Fig. 7A shows that a PrPc-like immunoreactivity was detectable in 3F4MoPrPc-transfected PrP-/- neurons. This was accompanied by a partial but reproducible recovery of the staurosporine-induced caspase activation responsiveness displayed by PrP+/+ neurons (Fig. 7B). Thus, although mock-transfected PrP-/- display only 54% of the responsiveness of PrP+/+ neurons to staurosporine, three distinct 3F4MoPrP transfections of PrP-/- neurons consistently restored the staurosporine-induced caspase-3 activation to about 81% of the control. (Fig. 7B). This incomplete rescue is in apparent agreement with the relatively low efficiency of 3F4MoPrP cDNA transfection illustrated by the expression of exogenous PrPc in PrP-/- primary cultured neurons and agrees well with all of the data described above. PrP-/-Neurons Display Lower p53 Expression and Activity—We examined the putative modulation of the tumor suppressor oncogene p53 by endogenous PrPc. Primary cultured neurons devoid of their endogenous PrPc content display decreased p53 immunoreactivity (Fig. 8A) and transcriptional activity (Fig. 8B), thereby demonstrating that endogenous PrPc controls p53 expression and activity. Of greatest interest was the observation that p53 expression in the 1-month-old mouse brain was drastically lower in PrP-/- than in wild-type mice (Fig. 8C), indicating that PrPc also controls p53 expression in vivo. PrPc Controls Post-transcriptional Modulators of p53 Activity—We searched for post-transcriptional modulators of p53 activity that would be under the control of endogenous PrP in primary cultured neurons. Mdm2 was recently shown to decrease p53 metabolic stability thereby lowering its activity (20.Yin Y. Luciani M.G. Fahraeus R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 462-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that Mdm2 immunoreactivity is higher in PrP-/- than in wild-type neurons (Fig. 8D), a phenotype completely opposite from that observed for p53 immunoreactivity (see Fig. 5A). As p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) was reported to up-regulate p53 activity via upstream of Mdm2 expression (26.Zhu Y. Mao X.O. Sun Y. Xia Z. Greenberg D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22909-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we also examined the endogenous levels of the active, phosphorylated counterpart of p38 MAPK. Active p38 immunoreactivity was higher in wild-type than in PrP-/- neurons (Fig. 8E), suggesting that PrPc also controls p38 phosphorylation at endogenous levels. Spongiform encephalopathies comprise a group of several transmissible diseases known for a long time to affect animals and are always characterized at their late stages by neurodegenerescence and ultimately death (1.Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5101) Google Scholar, 27.Chesebro B. Neuron. 1999; 24: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 28.Aguzzi A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 289-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 29.Martins V.R. Brentani R.R. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 1223: 1-3Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30.Hur K. Kim J.I. Choi S.-I. Choi E.-K. Carp R.I. Kim Y.-S. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 1637-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These pathologies became of higher interest when it appeared that some of these diseases could also affect human beings, leading to the logical suspicion that the human pathology could be transmitted by animals and, therefore, that mankind was facing a novel public health problem with unforeseeable consequences. The boost of interest in this novel and intriguing type of pathology has been focused mainly on a better knowledge of a 33-35 kDa sialoglycosylated and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored polypeptide called prion, which appears to be the main actor in the disease. Interestingly, it was demonstrated that the pathogenic agent (or at least clearly its main component) was a protein called scrapie, or PrPres, which has the same primary sequence as its ubiquitous counterpart, cellular prion or PrPc (1.Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5101) Google Scholar). However, PrPres displays a β-sheet-enriched structure that renders it highly resistant to proteolysis and prone to aggregation (1.Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5101) Google Scholar). How PrPres acquires its pathological conformation is not yet established but infectious inoculates “mimicking” the disease require endogenous PrPc to propagate, as they are fully innocuous in mice engineered to abrogate their endogenous PrPc protein content (6.Büeler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar). Also yet not fully understood are the molecular determinants that initiate the pathogenic process in sporadic encephalopathies. A better understanding of these sporadic cases would likely come from a better knowledge of the physiological function of PrPc and the putative dysfunction that takes place when these diseases occur. Few things really are known concerning the physiological function of PrPc, but several lines of evidence indicate that PrPc could modulate cell death. PrP mutations could trigger caspase activation (31.Jamieson E. Jeffrey M. Ironside J.W. Fraser J.R. NeuroReport. 2001; 12: 3567-3572Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and murine scrapie appears to be associated with cell death (32.Siso S. Puig B. Varea R. Vidal E. Acin C. Prinz M. Montrasio F. Badiola J. Aguzzi A. Pumarola M. Ferrer I. Acta Neuropathol. 2002; 103: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, prion infection impairs the cellular response to oxidative stress inducers (33.Milhavet O. Lehmann S. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2002; 38: 328-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and triggers apoptosis in a hypothalamic neuronal cell line (34.Schätzl H.M. Laszlo L. Holtzman D.M. Tatzelt J. DeArmond S.J. Weiner R.I. Mobley W.C. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8821-8831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether, these data suggest the ability of PrPc to modulate cell death, but whether this is due to an exacerbation of a proapoptotic function or, alternatively, to the alteration of an antiapoptotic phenotype could both be envisioned. The literature in this field does not really solve the debate, and there are opposing data supporting both possibilities. On one hand, Kuwahara et al. (8.Kuwahara C. Takeuchi A.M. Nishimura T. Haraguchi K. Kubosaki A. Matsumoto Y. Saeki K. matsumoto Y. Yokoyama T. Itohara S. Onodera T. Nature. 1999; 400: 225-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) have shown that serum deprivation-induced cell death is exacerbated in hippocampal neurons prepared from Prnp-/- mice. On the other hand, PrPc also appears to protect human neurons from cell death triggered by overexpression of the proapoptotic oncogene Bax (9.Bounhar Y. Zhang Y. Goodyer C.G. LeBlanc A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39145-39149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Finally, a recent paper indicates that PrPc could be a cellular mediator protecting retinal tissue from anisomycin-induced apoptosis (10.Chiarini L.B. Freitas A.R.O. Zanata S.M. Brentani R.R. Martins V.R. Linden R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3317-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). From the above data one should expect a drastic deleterious effect of PrPc deletion due to the abrogation of this antiapoptotic phenotype. This seems not to be the case, as PrPc-deficient mice are safe, healthy, and apparently develop and behave normally (15.Bueler H. Fischer M. Lang Y. Bluethmann H. Lipp H. DeArmond S. Prusiner S.B. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Nature. 1992; 356: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent article indicates that post-natal deletion of the PrPc alters the excitability of CA1 hippocampal neurons but does not induce neurodegeneration in adulthood (12.Mallucci G.R. Ratté S. Asante E.A. Linehan J. Gowland I. Jefferys J.G.R. Collinge J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). We had previously established that overexpression of PrPc enhances staurosporine-induced cell toxicity and DNA fragmentation and activates caspase-3 in stably transfected HEK293, TSM1 neurons, or inducible Rov9 cell lines (13.Paitel E. Alves da Costa C. Vilette D. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1208-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14.Paitel E. Fahraeus R. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10061-10066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we showed that PrPc-induced caspase-3 activation is mediated by an Mdm2-regulated p53-dependent pathway in TSM1 neurons (14.Paitel E. Fahraeus R. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10061-10066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These data are fully in agreement with a previous work demonstrating that transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type PrPc could exhibit severe neurodegeneration (11.Westaway D. DeArmond S.J. Cayetano-Canlas J. Groth D. Foster D. Yang S.-L. Torchia M. Carlson G.A. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 117-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, it could be argued that the PrPc-related phenotype could be, in both cases, due to overexpression of the protein. In line with such an hypothesis, a recent study nicely established that in N2A murine neuroblastoma cells, neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration could be associated with cytosolic accumulation of PrPc (35.Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). These data fully agreed with our demonstration that the manipulation of cytosolic PrPc concentration could indeed affect cell death. Thus, proteasomal inhibition leads to increased PrPc-like immunoreactivity accompanied by drastic potentiation of caspase activation in HEK293 cells (13.Paitel E. Alves da Costa C. Vilette D. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1208-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Conversely, depletion of cellular PrPc by immunosequestration at the membrane precludes the PrPc-induced proapoptotic phenotype (13.Paitel E. Alves da Costa C. Vilette D. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1208-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The present study first confirms that overexpression of PrPc enhances staurosporine-stimulated caspase-3 activity and demonstrates for the first time that in HEK293 cells, all PrPc-related phenotypes are p53-dependent. These data have been fully reinforced by our observation that PrPc is inactive in p53-deficient fibroblasts. Interestingly, we have established that, besides post-transcriptional modulation of p53, PrPc also enhances p53 promoter transactivation. It was most important to establish that the p53-dependent PrPc-related phenotype was not solely due to an artifactual perturbation of the cell physiology caused by the overexpression of the protein. In this context, we examined the contribution of endogenous PrPc to apoptotic response by monitoring cell death in primary cultured neurons derived from mice embryos in which the Prnp gene had been abrogated (Zrch-1). Our data show that deletion of PrPc led to a phenotype fully opposite of PrP overexpression. Prnp-/- neurons are indeed less sensitive to staurosporine as monitored by TUNEL-positive cells, DNA fragmentation, and caspase activity and immunoreactivity. Furthermore, this phenotype appears linked to a drastic reduction of p53 activity and immunoreactivity. Finally, the p53 activator (p38 MAPK) and inhibitor (Mdm2) immunoreactivities are reduced. This indicates that PrPc likely controls p53, at least in part, at a post-transcriptional level, as we demonstrated in TSM1 neurons by an overexpression approach (13.Paitel E. Alves da Costa C. Vilette D. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1208-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, our current study further demonstrates that PrPc controls caspase activity through a p53-dependent and Mdm2-regulated process and that this proapoptotic phenotype is not caused artifactually by overexpression of the protein. We recently established that in Alzheimer's disease, presenilin-2, a protein that when mutated mainly contributes to Alzheimer's disease-related pathologies, also controls cell death response to staurosporine by an identical p53-dependent mechanism (36.Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Mattson M.P. Amson R. Telerman A. Ancolio K. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4043-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This observation, together with our demonstration that similar proteolytic dysfunctions occur in both Alzheimer's and prion diseases, suggests that several common features could link apparently distinct neurodegenerative diseases (37.Checler F. Vincent B. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 616-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This is also true when one considers Parkinson's disease pathology in which an α-synuclein anti-apoptotic physiological phenotype (22.Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) is associated to p53 down-regulation, which is abolished by 60H-dopamine, a toxin associated with this pathology (38.Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Vincent B. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50980-50984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Altogether, these observations suggest envisioning p53 as a molecular target for therapeutic strategies in various neurodegenerative pathologies. We are most grateful to Pr.

The loop carrying the catalytic general acid Glu285 cannot be resolved in some of the structures but could be visualized in its “open” and “closed” (catalytic) conformations in other structures. The protonated state of Glu285 is presumably stabilized by its proximity to the negative charge of the substrate, representing a new variation of substrate-assisted catalysis mechanism. Hemicellulose and cellulose are the main components of the plant cell wall and the most abundant natural polysaccharides in nature. The natural degradation of these polymers, a key step in the carbon cycle on Earth, is carried out by microorganisms that can be found either free in the environment or in the digestive tract of higher animals. Efficient cellulolytic microorganisms typically secrete a battery of enzymes that can function either alone or as parts of larger enzymatic complexes such as the cellulosome (1.Shoham Y. Lamed R. Bayer E.A. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 275-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 2.Shallom D. Shoham Y. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 3.Schwarz W.H. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 56: 634-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The enzymes that degrade cellulose and hemicellulose are in many cases modular and include catalytic domains of glycoside hydrolases and/or carbohydrate esterases as well as carbohydrate-binding modules that allow the soluble enzymes to adhere to insoluble substrates (4.Bourne Y. Henrissat B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). A most informative and updated classification of these and other carbohydrate active enzymes is available on the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) server (available on the World Wide Web at afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY). The glycosidic bond is one of the most stable bonds in nature, with a half-life of over 5 million years; glycosidases can accelerate the hydrolysis of these bonds by more than 1017-fold (5.Wolfenden R. Lu X. Young G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6814-6815Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The key elements in this catalysis are the position of the catalytic residues and the distortion of the sugar ring so as to allow the stabilization of an oxocarbenium ion-like transition state (6.Zechel D.L. Withers S.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 1999; 33: 11-18Crossref Google Scholar). The enzymatic hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds results in either an overall retention or inversion of the anomeric configuration of the substrate. Retaining glycosidases follow a two-step double-displacement mechanism, usually involving two key active site carboxylic residues, one functioning as the nucleophile catalyst and the other as the acid/base catalyst. Inverting glycosidases use a single-displacement mechanism, in which usually one carboxylic acid functions as general acid and the other functions as a general base. α-Glucuronidases use the inverting mechanism to cleave the α-1,2-glycosidic bond between 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid (MeGlcA) 1The abbreviations used are: MeGlcA, 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid; GH, glycoside hydrolase family; GlcA67A, C. japonicus α-glucuronidase; AguA, G. stearothermophilus T-6 α-glucuronidase; WT, wild type; MeGlcAXyl3, 2-O-(4-O-methyl-α-d-glucuronosyl)-β-d-xylotriose; NSLS, National Synchrotron Light Source. and xylose units, which are part of short β-1,4-xylooligomers, the main products of the enzymatic hydrolysis of xylan by xylanases (7.Biely P.

Acta. 2000; 1474: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The different bacterial and fungal α-glucuronidases are classified as glycoside hydrolase family (GH) 67, and the first crystal structure of an enzyme from this family, the α-glucuronidase from Cellvibrio japonicus (GlcA67A), was recently described (9.Nurizzo D. Nagy T. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Structure. 2002; 10: 547-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The enzyme is folded into three domains, the central of which has a (β/α)8-barrel fold that accommodates the active site. Geobacillus stearothermophilus (formerly Bacillus stearothermophilus) strain T-6 is a thermophilic bacterium that possesses an extensive hemicellulolytic system (2.Shallom D. Shoham Y. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Many of the genes comprising this system are clustered together on the bacterial chromosome, and so far the identified components include intracellular and extracellular GH-10 xylanases; GH- 39, -43, and -52 β-xylosidases; GH-51 α-l-arabinofuranosidases; acetyl-xylan esterases; xylose catabolism genes; and transport systems (10.Gilead S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 43667-43673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The α-glucuronidase T-6 (AguA) is part of a 15.5-kb-long operon involved in the utilization of d-glucuronic acid (15.Shulami S. Gat O. Sonenshein A.L. Shoham Y. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3695-3704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Zaide G. Shallom D. Shulami S. Zolotnitsky G. Golan G. Baasov T. Shoham G. Shoham Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3006-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here we present high resolution (1.5–2.0-Å) crystal structures of AguA in complex with substrates and products. These structures provide direct evidences for several mechanistic features. We suggest that the catalytic mechanism of AguA includes a conformational change of the active-site loop carrying the general acid residue Glu285, a distortion of the substrate into a conformation much closer to the flat conformation required for the oxocarbenium ion-like transition state, and charge repulsion between the acidic substrate and the general acid residue so as to allow its protonated state. The structural data, combined with biochemical analysis of catalytic mutants, suggest that the two carboxylic residues Asp364 and Glu392, serve as general bases, activating together the nucleophilic water molecule. Protein Expression and Purification—The α-glucuronidases from G. stearothermophilus strains T-6 and T-1 (AguA T-6 and AguA T-1; accession numbers AAC98128, and AAL32057, respectively) were cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The purification of the recombinant wild type and mutant enzymes was done as described before (16.Zaide G. Shallom D. Shulami S. Zolotnitsky G. Golan G. Baasov T. Shoham G. Shoham Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3006-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Production of the selenomethionine derivative of AguA was carried out in the methionine auxotrophic Escherichia coli strain B834(DE3), essentially as described previously (17.Mechaly A. Teplitsky A. Belakhov V. Baasov T. Shoham G. Shoham Y. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 78: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and protein purification proceeded as for the wild type enzyme. α-Glucuronidase activity was determined by measuring the release of MeGlcA from aldotetraouronic acid using the Milner and Avigad assay for uronic acids (18.Milner Y. Avigad G. Carbohydr. Res. 1967; 4: 359-361Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar), as described before (16.Zaide G. Shallom D. Shulami S. Zolotnitsky G. Golan G. Baasov T. Shoham G. Shoham Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3006-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Crystallization and X-ray Diffraction Data Collection—All crystals were obtained using the hanging drop crystallization method and grown at 20 °C, with some modifications of the procedures described previously (19.Teplitsky A. Shulami S. Moryles S. Zaide G. Shoham Y. Shoham G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 869-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The best crystals were obtained by mixing 5 μl of the original enzyme solution (10 mg/ml) with an equal volume of reservoir solution (containing 14% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 12% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol, and 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.0–5.5) and equilibrating the drop with 1 ml of the reservoir solution. For x-ray data measurement, crystals were transferred into a cryo-solution (containing 75% reservoir solution and 25% glycerol) for about 30 s before direct flash cooling in a nitrogen gas cold stream (at 90–100 K). The diffraction pattern of all crystals grown and flash-cooled in this procedure indicated that they are isomorphous (unit cell parameters are within ±2% of the mean values) to the previously reported crystals of wild type (WT) AguA (T1 crystal form) (19.Teplitsky A. Shulami S. Moryles S. Zaide G. Shoham Y. Shoham G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 869-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), with a tetragonal space group of P41212, mean unit cell dimensions of a = b = 74.6 Å, c = 330.3 Å, and with one molecule per crystallographic asymmetric unit. Six types of crystals were used for complete data measurement and structural analysis, as follows: 1) crystals of the selenomethionine derivative of AguA; 2) crystals of WT (uncomplexed) AguA; 3) crystals of the E285N mutant of AguA, which were co-crystallized with the substrate aldotetraouronic acid (2-O-(4-O-methyl-α-d-glucuronosyl)-β-d-xylotriose) (in the final model of this structure, only the MeGlcA group was resolved, and the xylotriose group had no apparent electron density); 4) crystals of the E285N mutant, which were soaked for 10 s in a solution containing ∼5 mg/ml of aldotetraouronic acid and then flash-cooled (in the final model of this structure, an intact substrate was found to be bound to the enzyme); 5) crystals of WT AguA, which were soaked for 5 s in a solution containing ∼4 mg/ml of aldotetraouronic acid and then flash-cooled (in the final model of this structure, the two reaction products MeGlcA and xylotriose were observed in the active site); 6) crystals of the E386Q mutant of AguA. Two independent sets of multiple anomalous diffraction data were collected on the selenomethionine crystals, using one single crystal for each multiple anomalous diffraction experiment (20.Hendrickson W.A. Ogata C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 494-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Each of these data sets included complete diffraction data that were collected at three different wavelengths around the selenium K edge (Table I). The two data sets were measured at 100 K, using a MAR-CCD (133-mm) detector (MAR-Research Inc.), on beamline BM14 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). All other data sets were collected (95 K) at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) (Brookhaven National Laboratory). The WT AguA crystals were used for a 1.70-Å data set on NSLS/X8C, using a Quantum-4 CCD detector (ADSC Inc.). The E285N crystals were used for 1.85- and 1.75-Å data sets for the co-crystallized and soaked crystals, respectively, on NSLS/X12B using a Quantum-4 CCD detector. The substrate-soaked WT crystals were used for a 1.50-Å data set on NSLS/X25, using a Brandeis B4 CCD detector (Brandeis University). The E386Q crystals were used for a 2.0-Å data set on DESY/EMBL (Hamburg, Germany) beamline X13, using a MAR-CCD (165-mm) detector. All of the diffraction data sets were processed and reduced with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (21.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 407-426Google Scholar).

Ogata C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 494-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 22.Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1872-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Model building was performed with the program O (23.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar). Due to the relatively high electron density of the selenium atoms and other landmark residues, the exact chain tracing and individual fitting of amino acid side chains was relatively straightforward. The structure of the WT AguA was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMORE (24.Navaza J. Acta Cryst. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar), with the selenomethionine AguA structure as the reference model. Further refinement was performed with the program CNS (25.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16965) Google Scholar). The progress of refinement was monitored by following the overall values of Rfactor and Rfree (26.Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3863) Google Scholar), calculated for 10% randomly selected reflections. All other structures were solved and refined in a similar procedure (Table II). The Overall Structure of AguA—The recombinant α-glucuronidase proteins were obtained from two related strains of G. stearothermophilus, T-1 and T-6 (AguA-T1 and AguA-T6). These two enzymes are essentially identical, differing in only 2 of the 679 amino acids of the proteins. The recombinant enzymes were overexpressed in E. coli, purified in 1-g quantities, and crystallized (16.Zaide G. Shallom D. Shulami S. Zolotnitsky G. Golan G. Baasov T. Shoham G. Shoham Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3006-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19.Teplitsky A. Shulami S. Moryles S. Zaide G. Shoham Y. Shoham G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 869-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of WT, selenomethionine derivative, catalytic mutants, and enzyme-substrate/product complexes of AguA-T1 and AguA-T6 were obtained. All of the present structures were determined at relatively high resolutions (1.5–2.0 Å) and at good final values of Rfactor (13.9–19.3%) and Rfree (17.2–21.8%) (Table I). Based on these values, the average experimental error in the coordinates of these models is around ±0.1 Å according to the Luzzati error estimation (27.Luzzati P.V. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1952; 5: 802-805Crossref Google Scholar), permitting a reliable analysis of interactions and geometries in the structures presented here. Representative sections of the electron density maps of two of the complexed structures obtained are shown in Fig. 2a. Since the structures of the WT AguA-T1 and AguA-T6 were identical within the experimental error margins (except for slight changes around residues 38 and 259, which are different between the two enzymes), we describe here only the 1.7-Å resolution structure of AguA-T1 (Fig. 2b). AguA is an α/β globular protein with overall dimensions of about 91 × 56 × 53 Å for a monomer. The enzyme is built of three distinct domains, which are connected by extended loops. The central domain has a (β/α)8 fold (TIM barrel), and it contains about half of the protein residues (amino acids 143–471). This domain is not organized as a classical TIM barrel; there are an additional two short β-strands between the first β-strand and the first α-helix (β7 and α4); the α-helix between strands β14 and β15 is missing; and two α-helices rather than one are located after both strands β11 and β15 (Fig. 2c). The N-terminal domain (residues 1–142) is made of a six-stranded β-sheet and three α-helices. The C-terminal domain, which includes the last 208 amino acids, is mostly α-helical and lies as an envelope covering almost half of the central domain (Fig. 2b). The final structural models consisted of almost all of the 679 amino acid residues of the protein, lacking only the first 2–4 N-terminal residues. In three of the five structural models, the loop containing residues 283–287 had disordered electron density, suggesting conformational flexibility. Interestingly, this loop is experimentally observed in two different conformations in the two other structures. The functional implications of this conformational change are discussed below. AguA is a homodimer in solution (16.Zaide G. Shallom D. Shulami S. Zolotnitsky G. Golan G. Baasov T. Shoham G. Shoham Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3006-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), yet under the conditions employed it crystallized with one molecule per crystallographic asymmetric unit. Generation of all of the symmetryrelated molecules in the crystallographic unit cell revealed a possible dimeric form, which seems to be the most biologically relevant. The contact region between the two subunits involves the following residues from each monomer: Trp328 and Arg329 from the (β/α)8 domain and Glu536, Arg548, Glu654, Asp657, Arg665, and Lys666, from the C-terminal domain (Fig. 3). The assignment of this dimerization contact is supported by mutagenesis and biochemical studies, showing that these residues are essential for dimer formation. 2D. Shallom, G. Golan, G. Shoham, and Y. Shoham, manuscript in preparation. Comparison with Family 67 and Other Glycosidases—To date, the structure of GlcA67A from C. japonicus is the only other three-dimensional structure of a GH-67 glycosidase (9.Nurizzo D. Nagy T. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Structure. 2002; 10: 547-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28.Nagy T. Nurizzo D. Davies G.J. Biely P. Lakey J.H. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20286-20292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). AguA and GlcA67A share sequence identity of 42% and similarity of 59% of 665 aligned residues. The overall fold of the two enzymes is similar, and structure comparison shows high resemblance with root mean square deviations of 1.13 Å for all C-α atoms (structural homology was performed using the DALI server (29.Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar)). The two structures differ mainly in the C-terminal domain, where GlcA67A has an additional polypeptide chain of 33 residues, which is not present in the AguA sequence. The most striking difference between the two enzymes is in their dimeric structure. Whereas in AguA the contact region between the two monomers is relatively narrow and located at the tip of the C-terminal domain, in GlcA67A the dimer-forming residues are scattered on a much wider surface, which encloses parts from the C terminus as well as the middle of the (β/α)8-barrel (9.Nurizzo D. Nagy T. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Structure. 2002; 10: 547-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The dimeric interfaces of the two enzymes do not overlap. As a result, in GlcA67A the dimeric interface is closer to the active site than in AguA, but in both enzymes the substrate binding sites are exposed to the solvent. The difference in the dimeric forms of AguA and GlcA67A is consistent with the degree of sequence conservation of the two α-glucuronidases (see Supplementary Fig. 1). Although the (β/α)8-barrel is one of the most common folds for enzymes in general and glycosidases in particular, the overall arrangement of the three domains comprising the α-glucuronidases seems to be unique to GH-67 glycosidases. The combination of the N-terminal domain and the central domain of the AguA structure resembles domains I and II of the Streptomyces plicatus β-hexosaminidase (30.Mark B.L. Vocadlo D.J. Knapp S. Triggs-Raine B.L. Withers S.G. James M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10330-10337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and domains II and III of Serratia marcescens chitobiase (31.Tews I. Perrakis A. Oppenheim A. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Superpositions reveal relatively low structural similarities, with average root mean square differences of 1.9 and 2.5 Å, between the AguA domains and the equivalent N-terminal and TIM-barrel domains, respectively. As in these GH-20 glycosidases, the function of the N-terminal domain of AguA is not yet clear. Previously, we have shown that removal of this domain does not significantly affect thermostability, but it does prevent the correct oligomerization of the protein and lowers its catalytic activity to 1% of the wild type activity (16.Zaide G. Shallom D. Shulami S. Zolotnitsky G. Golan G. Baasov T. Shoham G. Shoham Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3006-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interestingly, from the structure it seems that this domain is quite distant from the dimerization area, and its removal probably exposes hydrophobic residues located on the (β/α)8 domain, causing the altered oligomerization observed. Structures of AguA Complexed with Intact and Cleaved Substrates—Based on biochemical and mutational studies of AguA, it was previously suggested that the active site of the enzyme is located at the middle (β/α)8 domain and that the conserved residues Glu285, Asp364, and Glu392 have an important role in catalysis (16.Zaide G. Shallom D. Shulami S. Zolotnitsky G. Golan G. Baasov T. Shoham G. Shoham Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3006-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). From the structure of the WT AguA, it appears that Asp364 and Glu392 are located at the C-terminal side of the β-sheets of the (β/α)8 domain (Fig. 4a). In an attempt to trap the Michaelis complex, we used the catalytic mutant E285N together with the natural substrate aldotetraouronic acid (2-O-(4-O-methyl-α-d-glucuronosyl)-β-d-xylotriose, or MeGlcAX-yl3 for short). Co-crystallization experiments have resulted in the 1.85-Å resolution binary complex of the enzyme with the reaction product MeGlcA, indicating that the residual activity of this mutant during the crystallization and the time elapsed until the data collection (about 2 months) was enough to cleave the substrate (Fig. 4b). When the E285N crystals were briefly soaked in the MeGlcAXyl3 solution followed by flash freezing, the electron density at 1.75-Å resolution unambiguously showed the intact substrate bound to the enzyme (Figs. 2a and 4c). When a similar strategy of brief soaking and flash freezing was employed with the WT enzyme, the 1.5-Å resolution structure revealed that the substrate was cleaved, and the two reaction-products, MeGlcA and xylotriose, are trapped in the active site (Figs. 2a and 4d). In the two structures where the xylotriose moiety is present (E285N-substrate and WT-products), only the first two sugar units of the xylotriose could be resolved in the models, and the reducing end xylose unit is probably exposed to the solvent and too loose to produce clear electron density. All of the observed ligands are found bound at the active site of the enzyme, which has a pocket topology of exo-acting glycosidases (Fig. 4e) (32.Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). In the structure of the WT enzyme, a glycerol molecule (originating from the cryogenic freezing solution) is located in the active site, probably replacing water molecules present in these positions in aqueous solutions (Fig. 4a). Electrostatic potential analysis of the solvent-accessible surface of the protein indicates that the active site cavity is relatively polar, with a distinct positively charged region at the glucuronic acid binding site. In all of the complexed structures, the MeGlcA molecule is bound in a similar manner at the bottom of the active site pocket and held in place by stacking interactions with the conserved Trp150 and an extensive hydrogen-bonding network with the conserved residues Glu158, Arg159, Asn201, Lys281, Arg318, Arg335, Lys359, Asp364, and Glu392 (Fig. 4, b–d). Trp150 is also involved, together with the conserved Val200, in forming the hydrophobic surrounding around the methyl group of the MeGlcA, as was observed in the GlcA67A from C. japonicus (28.Nagy T. Nurizzo D. Davies G.J. Biely P. Lakey J.H. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20286-20292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In both the substrate and the product complexes, the conserved Trp540 forms stacking interactions with the xylose at the +1 subsite. Compared with the MeGlcA moiety, all of the xylose units are more exposed to the solvent and share fewer interactions with the enzyme. In glycosidases in general, the sugar at the -1 subsite (the glycon) is bound by a larger number of interactions as compared with the +1 subsite (the aglycon). This is consistent with the observation that the specificity of glycosidases i"

The presence of this metal-binding aspartic acid appears to be common to most dinuclear, metal-containing, hydrolytic enzymes; particularly those with a β-lactamase fold. In an effort to probe the catalytic and metal-binding role of Asp-120 in L1, three site-directed mutants (D120C, D120N, and D120S) were prepared and characterized using metal analyses, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and presteady-state and steady-state kinetics. The D120C, D120N, and D120S mutants were shown to bind 1.6 ± 0.2, 1.8 ± 0.2, and 1.1 ± 0.2 mol of Zn(II) per monomer, respectively. The mutants exhibited 10- to 1000-fold drops in kcat values as compared with wild-type L1, and a general trend of activity, wild-type > D120N > D120C and D120S, was observed for all substrates tested. Solvent isotope and pH dependence studies indicate one or more protons in flight, with pKa values outside the range of pH 5–10 (except D120N), during a rate-limiting step for all the enzymes. These data demonstrate that Asp-120 is crucial for L1 to bind its full complement of Zn(II) and subsequently for proper substrate binding to the enzyme. This work also confirms that Asp-120 plays a significant role in catalysis, presumably via hydrogen bonding with water, assisting in formation of the bridging hydroxide/water, and a rate-limiting proton transfer in the hydrolysis reaction.

The ability of bacteria to acquire resistance to antibiotics is a serious problem that continues to challenge modern society (1.Neu H.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1064-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar). Excessive use and often misuse of antibiotics in the clinic and for agricultural purposes has resulted in tremendous selective pressure for antibiotic-resistant bacteria (2.Levy S.B. Sci. Am. 1998; 3: 47-53Google Scholar). These bacteria utilize a variety of methods to become resistant, including modification of cell wall components to prevent antibiotic binding, production of efflux pumps that transport the antibiotic out of the cell, and the production of enzymes that hydrolyze and render the antibiotic ineffective (1.Neu H.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1064-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar, 2.Levy S.B. Sci. Am. 1998; 3: 47-53Google Scholar). The most common and least expensive effective antibiotics currently used are the β-lactams, such as carbapenems, cephalosporins, and penicillins (3.Kotra L.P. Mobashery S. Arch. Immunol. Ther. Exp. 1999; 47: 211-216PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Bush K. Mobashery S. Mobashery R.A. Resolving the Antibiotic Paradox. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1998: 71-98Google Scholar). These antibiotics are mechanism-based inhibitors of transpeptidase, a bacterial enzyme required for the production of a strong viable cell wall (5.Eberhardt C. Kuerschner L. Weiss D.S. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3726-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 6.Therrien C. Levesque R.C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 251-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Knox J.R. Moews P.C. Frere J.M. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 937-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In response to their widespread use, an increasing number of bacterial strains have acquired the ability to produce β-lactamases, enzymes that hydrolyze and render β-lactam antibiotics ineffective. There are over 300 distinct β-lactamases known, and Bush has classified these into four distinct groups based on their molecular properties (8.Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar, 9.Bush K. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1998; 27: S48-S53Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). One of the more troubling of these is group 3 (class B), the metallo-β-lactamases, which are Zn(II)-dependent enzymes that hydrolyze nearly all known β-lactams and for which there are no or very few clinically useful inhibitors (10.Siemann S.

Walsh T.R. Res. Signpost. 1999; 3: 105-132Google Scholar). To date, there are no reports of a metallo-β-lactamase being isolated from a major pathogen (18.Bush K. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2001; 32: 1085-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 19.Rice L.B. Bonomo R.A. Drug Resist. Updates. 2000; 3: 178-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); however, these enzymes are produced by a variety of minor pathogens such as Bacteroides fragilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and the continued extensive use of β-lactam antibiotics will inevitably result in the production of a metallo-β-lactamase by a major pathogen. There is significant diversity within the metallo-β-lactamases and Bush, based on their amino acid sequence identity and substrate affinity, has further divided them into three subgroups (9.Bush K. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1998; 27: S48-S53Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A similar grouping scheme based on structural properties has also been offered (20.Galleni M. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Rossolini G.M. Spencer J. Dideberg O. Frere J.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 660-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The diversity of these subgroups is best exemplified by their vastly differing efficacies toward non-clinical inhibitors; these differences lead to the prediction that finding a single inhibitor for all metallo-β-lactamases may not be possible (17.Crowder M.W.

To address this problem, we are currently characterizing a representative enzyme from each of the metallo-β-lactamase subgroups with the goal of identifying common structural and mechanistic similarities that can be targeted for the generation of clinically useful inhibitors. This work describes our efforts to characterize metallo-β-lactamase L1 from S. maltophilia. S. maltophilia is an important pathogen in nosocomial infections of immunocompromised patients suffering from cancer, cystic fibrosis, drug addiction, and AIDS and in patients with organ transplants and on dialysis (30.Khardori N.

Schacher B. Frei R. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1988; 10: 765-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and to β-lactams due to the production of two chromosomally expressed β-lactamases, a group 2e β-lactamase called L2 and a group 3c β-lactamase called L1 (34.Walsh T.R. Payne D.J. Neville T. Tolson D. MacGowan A.P. Bennett P.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1460-1462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Walsh T.R. Hall L. Assinder S.J. Nichols W.W. Cartwright S.J. MacGowan A.P. Bennett P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 199-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). L1 has been cloned, overexpressed, and partially characterized by kinetic and crystallographic studies (36.Crowder M.W. Walsh T.R. Banovic L. Pettit M. Spencer J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 921-926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R. Taylor I.A. Emery D.C. Verma C.S. Gamblin S.J. Spenser J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The enzyme exists as a homotetramer of ∼118 kDa in solution and in the crystalline state, tightly binding two Zn(II) ions per subunit. The Zn1 site has 3 histidine residues and 1 bridging hydroxide as ligands, and the Zn2 site has 2 histidines, 1 aspartic acid, 1 terminally bound water, and the bridging hydroxide as ligands (see Fig. 1). Efforts to solve the crystal structure of one of the metallo-β-lactamases with a bound substrate molecule have failed, most likely due to the high activity of the enzymes, even in the crystalline state, toward all β-lactam-containing antibiotics (37.Ullah J.H.

Therefore, computational studies have been used extensively to study substrate binding, the role of the Zn(II) ions in catalysis, the protonation state of the active site, and inhibitor binding (37.Ullah J.H.

Taylor R.A. Crowder M.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11330-11339Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). With L1, three key assumptions were made: 1) the bridging hydroxide functions as the nucleophile during catalysis, 2) Zn1 coordinates the β-lactam carbonyl, and 3) Zn2 coordinates the amide nitrogen of the β-lactam ring (37.Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R. Taylor I.A. Emery D.C. Verma C.S. Gamblin S.J. Spenser J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). One of the residues identified through computational studies to be catalytically important in L1 is the aspartic acid at position 120 (the standard numbering scheme for class B β-lactamases is utilized herein (20.Galleni M. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Rossolini G.M. Spencer J. Dideberg O. Frere J.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 660-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar)). From the crystal structure, Asp-120 clearly coordinates Zn2, with its unbound oxygen located directly under the bridging group in the active site (37.Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R. Taylor I.A. Emery D.C. Verma C.S. Gamblin S.J. Spenser J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). This is a geometry shared by many dinuclear metal-containing hydrolytic enzymes, including other metallo-β-lactamases and dioxygenases (46.Daiyasu H. Osaka K. Ishino Y. Toh H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Therefore, we believe that the findings of this work are applicable beyond L1 from S. maltophilia. In addition to its role as a metal-binding ligand, it has been hypothesized that Asp-120 electrostatically interacts with the bridging hydroxide, properly orienting it for nucleophilic attack on the substrate (37.Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R. Taylor I.A. Emery D.C. Verma C.S. Gamblin S.J. Spenser J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). This work describes our efforts to test this prediction and further our understanding the role of Asp-120 in both metal binding and substrate turnover. To probe the importance of this residue, three mutant enzymes were generated. Asp-120 was changed to a cysteine, an asparagine, and a serine to create D120C, D120N, and D120S, respectively (Fig. 1). Cysteine was substituted to allow for continued binding of Zn2 but eliminate any interaction of the residue with the bridging hydroxide/water. Asparagine was chosen as a chemically different but structurally similar surrogate for aspartic acid, allowing for continued binding of Zn2 and providing a moiety for interaction with the bridging hydroxide/water. Replacement of aspartic acid with serine was intended to remove both the metal-binding ability of the residue at this position and any ability to interact with the bridging hydroxide/water. Escherichia coli strains DH5α and BL21(DE3) were obtained from Invitrogen and Novagen, respectively. Plasmids pET26b and pUC19 were purchased from Novagen. Primers for sequencing and mutagenesis studies were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), MgSO4, Thermopol buffer, Deep Vent DNA polymerase, and restrictions enzymes were purchased from Promega or New England Biolabs. Polymerase chain reaction was conducted using a Thermolyne Amplitron II unit. DNA was purified using the Qiagen QIAquick gel extraction kit or Plasmid Purification kit with Qiagen-tip 100 (Midi) columns. Wizard Plus Minipreps were acquired from Promega. Luria-Bertani media in powder form was purchased from Invitrogen. Isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside, Biotech grade, was procured from Anatrace. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was purchased from Sigma. Protein solutions were concentrated with an Amicon ultrafiltration cell equipped with YM-10 DIAFLO membranes from Amicon, Inc. Dialysis tubing was prepared using Spectra/Por-regenerated cellulose molecular porous membranes with a molecular weight cut-off of 6–8000 g/mol. Q-Sepharose Fast Flow was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Nitrocefin was purchased from BD Biosciences, and solutions of nitrocefin were filtered through a Fisherbrand 0.45-μm syringe filter. Cefaclor, cefoxitin, and cephalothin were purchased from Sigma; penicillin G and ampicillin were purchased from Fisher. Imipenem, meropenem, and biapenem were generously supplied by Merck, Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, and Lederle (Japan), respectively. All buffers and media were prepared using Barnstead NANOpure ultrapure water. The overexpression plasmid for L1, pUB5832, was digested with NdeI and HindIII, and the resulting ∼900-bp piece was gel-purified and ligated using T4 ligase into pUC19, which was also digested with NdeI and HindIII, to yield the cloning plasmid pL1pUC19. Mutations were introduced into the L1 gene by using the overlap extension method of Ho et al. (47.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar), as described previously (48.Carenbauer, A. L., Garrity, J. A., Periyannan, G., Yates, R. B., and Crowder, M. W.

The oligonucleotides used for the preparation of the mutants are as follows: D120C forward, CACgCACACgCCTgCCATgCCggACCggTg; D120C reverse, CACCggTCCggCATggCAggCgTgTgCgTg; D120N forward, CACgCACACgCCAACCATgCCggACCggTg; D120N reverse, CACCggTCCggCATggTTggCgTgTgCgTg; D120S forward, CACgCACACgCCAgCCATgCCggACCggTg; and D120S reverse, CACCggTCCggCATggCTggCgTgTgCgTg. The ∼900-bp PCR products were digested with NdeI and HindIII and ligated into pUC19. The DNA sequences were analyzed by the Biosynthesis and Sequencing Facility in the Department of Biological Chemistry at Johns Hopkins University. After confirmation of the sequence, the mutated pL1pUC19 plasmid was digested with NdeI and HindIII, and the 900-bp, mutated L1 gene was gel-purified and ligated into pET26b to create the mutant overexpression plasmids. To test for overexpression of the mutant enzymes, E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were transformed with the mutated overexpression plasmids, and small scale growth cultures were used (48.Carenbauer, A.

Large-scale (4 liters) preparations of the L1 mutants were performed as described previously (36.Crowder M.W. Walsh T.R. Banovic L. Pettit M. Spencer J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 921-926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein purity was ascertained by SDS-PAGE. The concentrations of L1 and the mutants were determined by measuring the proteins' absorbances at 280 nm and using the published extinction coefficient of ϵ280 nm = 54,804 m–1·cm–1 (36.Crowder M.W.

Before metal analyses, the “as isolated” protein samples were dialyzed versus 3× 1 liter of metal-free, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, over 96 h at 4 °C. A Varian Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectrometer with atomic emission spectroscopy detection (ICP-AES) 1The abbreviations used are: ICP-AES, inductively coupled plasmaatomic emission spectroscopy; L1, metallo-β-lactamase from S. maltophilia; MTCN, MES-TRIS-CHES-NaCl buffer; CD, circular dichroism; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid. was used to determine the metal content of multiple preparations of wild-type L1 and L1 mutants. Calibration curves were based on four standards and had correlation coefficient limits of at least 0.9950. The final dialysis buffer was used as a blank. The emission line of 213.856 nm is the most intense for zinc and was used to determine the zinc content in the samples. The errors in metal content data reflect the standard deviation (σn–1) of multiple enzyme preparations. A second analysis of metal content was preformed on enzyme samples that were incubated for 1 h, on ice, in buffer containing a final concentration of 100 μm ZnCl2. These “metal-saturated” samples were then dialyzed versus 2× 1-liter metal-free buffer for a total of 4 h, and metal content was analyzed by ICP-AES as described above. Circular dichroism samples were prepared by dialyzing the purified enzyme samples versus 3 × 2 liters of 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, over 6 h. The samples were diluted with final dialysis buffer to ∼75 μg/ml. A JASCO J-810 CD spectropolarimeter operating at 25 °C was used to collect CD spectra. Assays were conducted at 25 °C in 50 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 μm ZnCl2 on an HP 5480A diode array UV-visible spectrophotometer. The changes in molar absorptivities (Δϵ) used to quantitate products were (in m–1 cm–1): nitrocefin, Δϵ485 = 17,420; cephalothin, Δϵ265 = –8,790; cefoxitin, Δϵ265 = –7,000; cefaclor, Δϵ280 = –6,410; imipenem, Δϵ300 = –9,000; meropenem, Δϵ293 = –7,600; biapenem, Δϵ293 = –8,630; ampicillin, Δϵ235 = –809; and penicillin G, Δϵ235 = –936. When possible, substrate concentrations were varied between 0.1 and 10 times the Km value, and changes in absorbance (ΔA) versus time data were measured for a period of 60 s for each substrate concentration. In kinetic studies using substrates with low Km values (cefoxitin, nitrocefin, and cephalothin) or with small Δϵ values (penicillin and ampicillin), substrate concentrations were varied between ∼Km and 10 times Km, and as much of the linear portion of the ΔA versus time data as possible was used to determine the velocity. Steady-state kinetics constants, Km and kcat, were determined by fitting initial velocity versus substrate concentration data directly to the Michaelis equation using Igor Pro (36.Crowder M.W. Walsh T.R. Banovic L. Pettit M. Spencer J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 921-926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reported errors reflect fitting uncertainties. All steady-state kinetic studies were performed in triplicate with recombinant L1 from at least three different enzyme preparations. pH dependence studies were performed as described above but using a buffer system containing 25 mm MES, 50 mm Tris, 25 mm CHES, 10 mm NaCl, and 100 μm ZnCl2 (MTCN). Buffers for each pH tested were made from a common 10× stock of MTCN buffer. The pH of each was then adjusted to the desired value using either 6 m HCl or 10 m NaOH, and the appropriate volume of aqueous ZnCl2 was added to reach a concentration of 100 μm. Km and kcat were determined as described above, and log plots of those values versus pH were generated using Igor Pro. Steady-state kinetic assays were conducted at 25 °C in 50 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 μm ZnCl2 and ranging in D2O concentrations from 0 to 100%, on a HP 5480A diode array UV-visible spectrophotometer. Steady-state kinetics constants, Km and kcat, were determined by fitting initial velocity versus substrate concentration data directly to the Michaelis equation using Igor Pro (36.Crowder M.W. Walsh T.R. Banovic L. Pettit M. Spencer J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 921-926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plots of kcat versus %D2O were generated using Igor Pro. The reported errors reflect fitting uncertainties. Rapid-scanning visible spectra of nitrocefin hydrolysis by L1, and the L1 mutants were collected on a Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer equipped with an Applied Photophysics PD.1 photodiode array detector and a 2-mm path length optical cell. The wild-type L1 experiment consisted of 25 μm enzyme and 5 μm nitrocefin in 50 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 μm ZnCl2, the reaction temperature was thermostated at 25 °C, and the spectra were collected between 300 and 725 nm. Data from at least three experiments were collected and averaged. Absorbance data were converted to concentration data as described previously by McMannus and Crowder (51.McMannus-Munoz S. Crowder M.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1547-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Due to weaker binding and slower turnover of substrate with the L1 mutants, enzyme concentrations of 50 μm were used with 5 μm nitrocefin utilizing the same buffer system and experimental conditions as in the wild-type L1 experiment. Stopped-flow fluorescence studies of nitrocefin hydrolysis by L1 were performed on an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV spectrophotometer, using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and a WG320 nm cut-off filter on the photomultiplier. These experiments were conducted at 10 °C using the same buffer as in the rapid-scanning visible studies. Fluorescence data were fitted to kobs = {(kf [S])/KS + [S])} + kr as described previously (52.Spencer J. Clark A.R. Walsh T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33638-33644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) or to kobs = kf[S] + kr by using CurveFit version 1.0. Wild-type L1, D120C, D120N, and D120S were overexpressed in E. coli and purified as previously described (36.Crowder M.W. Walsh T.R. Banovic L. Pettit M. Spencer J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 921-926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This procedure produced an average of 50–60 mg of >95% pure, active protein per 4 liters of growth culture. Circular dichroism spectra were collected on samples of wild-type, and each of the mutants to ensure the proteins produced using the pET26b overexpression system had the correct secondary structure. The CD spectra (data not shown) of wild-type L1 and the mutants were identical. Metal analyses on multiple preparations of wild-type L1 demonstrated that the enzyme binds 1.9 ± 0.2 Zn(II) ions per monomer (Table I), in agreement with previous results (36.Crowder M.W. Walsh T.R.

Metal analysis on multiple preparations of D120C, D120N, and D120S showed 1.6 ± 0.2, 1.8 ± 0.2, and 1.1 ± 0.2 Zn(II) ions per monomer, respectively.Table IMetal analysis and KS and kH/kD values with nitrocefin of wild-type L1 and L1 mutantsEnzyme Zn(II) contentKS with nitrocefinSolvent isotope kH/kDmol Zn(II)/mol monomerμmWt1.9 ± 0.238 ± 52.08 ± 0.03D120C1.6 ± 0.237 ± 61.47 ± 0.05D120N1.8 ± 0.297 ± 145.36 ± 0.22D120S1.1 ± 0.2Unable to determine1.87 ± 0.06 Open table in a new tab Steady-state kinetic constants Km and kcat were determined for wild-type L1 and each of the mutants with nine substrates. These values are presented in Tables II, III, IV. When using nitrocefin as substrate and 50 mm cacodylate, pH 7.0, as the buffer, wild-type L1 exhibited a kcat value of 38 ± 1s–1 and a Km value of 12 ± 1 μm. The inclusion of 100 μm ZnCl2 in the assay buffer resulted in slightly lower values of Km and higher values for kcat (36.Crowder M.W. Walsh T.R. Banovic L. Pettit M. Spencer J. Antimicrob.

Most substrates of this ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway are constitutively targeted for destruction through recognition of poorly understood structural hallmarks of misfolding. However, the normal yeast ER membrane protein 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (Hmg2p) undergoes ERAD that is physiologically regulated by sterol pathway signals. We have proposed that Hmg2p ERAD occurs by a regulated transition to an ERAD quality control substrate. Consistent with this, we had previously shown that Hmg2p is strongly stabilized by chemical chaperones such as glycerol, which stabilize misfolded proteins. To understand the features of Hmg2p that permit regulated ERAD, we have thoroughly characterized the effects of chemical chaperones on Hmg2p. These agents caused a reversible, immediate, direct change in Hmg2p degradation consistent with an effect on Hmg2p structure. We devised an in vitro limited proteolysis assay of Hmg2p in its native membranes. In vitro, chemical chaperones caused a dramatic, rapid change in Hmg2p structure to a less accessible form. As in the living cell, the in vitro action of chemical chaperones was highly specific for Hmg2p and completely reversible. To evaluate the physiological relevance of this model behavior, we used the limited proteolysis assay to examine the effects of changing in vivo degradation signals on Hmg2p structure. We found that changes similar to those observed with chemical chaperones were brought about by alteration of natural degradation signal. Thus, Hmg2p can undergo significant, reversible structural changes that are relevant to the physiological control of Hmg2p ERAD. These findings support the idea that Hmg2p regulation is brought about by regulated alteration of folding state. Considering the ubiquitous nature of quality control pathways in biology, it may be that this strategy of regulation is widespread.

Considering the ubiquitous nature of quality control pathways in biology, it may be that this strategy of regulation is widespread. Protein degradation has two principal functions in the living cell: regulation and quality control. Regulation generally involves the precise targeting of normal, functional proteins as a means of controlling specific cellular processes. Examples of proteins regulated by degradation include IκB (1.Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar), HIF1a (2.Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar), and numerous proteins required for cell cycle progression (3.Goebl M.G. Yochem J. Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Byers B. Science. 1988; 241: 1331-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 4.Deshaies R.J. Chau V. Kirschner M.

Quality control entails destruction of proteins that are misfolded or that have failed to correctly assemble into multimeric complexes as a means of limiting these potentially hazardous species. In both modes of degradation, targeting is highly specific but the criteria for recognition are nearly orthogonal. In regulation, unique features of a normally folded protein must be recognized by the degradation machinery to guarantee specific control of the appropriate cellular process. In contrast, quality control requires recognition of structural hallmarks that distinguish members of the broad set of abnormal proteins from their correctly folded counterparts in a manner that transcends protein sequence and identity. As a consequence, quality control and regulation are traditionally envisioned as distinct processes. It is possible, however, that the mechanisms that recognize misfolded proteins could be harnessed for regulation via controlled entry of the target protein into a constitutively acting quality control pathway.

Much of eukaryotic protein degradation occurs through the action of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, by which targeted proteins are covalently tagged with multiple copies of the 8 kDa protein ubiquitin, allowing recognition and proteolysis by the 26S proteasome. Specific transfer of ubiquitin to substrate requires an E3, or ubiquitin ligase, of which a large and growing collection has been identified and characterized. E3s are key determinants of specificity in ubiquitination pathways, as they mediate the recognition of target proteins. Most ubiquitin ligases studied to date function in regulatory targeting of specific proteins (6.Sakamoto K.M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 77: 44-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 7.Pickart C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 8.Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). A smaller group are known to participate in protein quality control, promoting the ubiquitination of misfolded proteins (9.Swanson R. Locher M. Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2660-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 10.Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P. Joazeiro C.A. Hampton R.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 11.Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Hishikawa N. Yamamoto M. Doyu M. Murata S. Tanaka K. Taniguchi N. Sobue G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36793-36798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the HRD complex, consisting of Hrd1p and Hrd3p, is an integral membrane E3 that mediates ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of a diverse group of misfolded and unassembled proteins, including luminal proteins such as CPY* and integral membrane proteins (10.Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P. Joazeiro C.A. Hampton R.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 12.Wilhovsky S. Gardner R. Hampton R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 13.Bordallo J. Plemper R.K. Finger A. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Thus, the HRD E3 specifically targets unrelated proteins that share only the still-unidentified hallmarks of misfolding. As predicted from these studies on model ERAD substrates, the yeast HRD complex has a general role in cellular quality control: hrd1Δ-null strains have elevated levels of unfolded proteins in the ER, indicating that the HRD pathway functions in limiting the abundance of spontaneously occurring misfolded proteins (14.Friedlander R. Jarosch E. Urban J. Volkwein C. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Along with this clear role in quality control, the HRD complex also functions in regulation of a normal, essential metabolic enzyme, HMGR. HMGR catalyzes a key step in sterol biosynthesis and is the primary drug target for treatment of high cholesterol. Both mammalian HMGR and the yeast isozyme Hmg2p undergo feedback-regulated, ubiquitin-mediated degradation in response to signals from the sterol pathway, in addition to more conventional regulation at the transcriptional level (15.Hampton R.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 345-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Increases in pathway signals lead to increased degradation and a concomitant reduction in the Hmg2p steady-state level. Conversely, decreased signals lead to decreased degradation and a rise in steady-state levels. This degradation leads to rapid, fine control of Hmg2p levels in response to the physiological requirements of the cell. In our genetic analysis of Hmg2p degradation, we identified the HRD complex as the ubiquitin ligase that mediates Hmg2p-regulated degradation (10.Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P. Joazeiro C.A. Hampton R.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 16.Gardner R.G. Swarbrick G.M. Bays N.W. Cronin S.R. Wilhovsky S. Seelig L. Kim C. Hampton R.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Thus, the controlled destruction of this enzyme is an intersection between regulation and quality control, being an instance in which a constitutively operating quality control pathway participates in the physiologically regulated targeting of a specific normal protein, Hmg2p. It is our goal to understand this mechanism of regulation, both to allow clear understanding of HMGR regulation, and as an exemplar for the harnessing of cellular quality control for regulatory purposes in nature and the clinic. The signal for Hmg2p degradation is the sterol pathway intermediate farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) or a molecule derived from it (17.Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31671-31678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). When FPP levels are high, the Hmg2p degradation rate is high, and when FPP levels are low, the Hmg2p degradation rate is low. In this way, the half-life of Hmg2p can vary from about 10 min to over 4 h. Experiments in which we rapidly manipulate FPP levels with drugs indicate that the extant pool of mature Hmg2p is subject to this stability control and appears to be poised to undergo changes in degradative status that happen rapidly and reversibly in response to the FPP-derived signal. How does FPP specifically regulate Hmg2p entry into the constitutively active HRD quality control pathway? We have previously proposed the most direct model: that Hmg2p acquires structural features of a quality control substrate in response to the FPP-derived signal (15.Hampton R.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 345-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18.Gardner R.G. Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4276-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 19.Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). This regulated structural transition would occur in mature protein and be reversed rapidly when signal decreases. In other words, the Hmg2p status as a quality control substrate could be switched, and during circumstances when the FPP-derived signal is high, for example in strains with high flux through the sterol synthesis pathway, Hmg2p should have properties or behaviors of a misfolded protein. To evaluate this idea, we used studies on the clinically important ΔF508 variant of CFTR as a conceptual guide. CFTR is a multispanning membrane protein that folds in the ER and is then transported to the plasma membrane, where it functions in ion transport. The ΔF508 variant is especially slow in folding to the proper native conformation, with ∼95% of the protein undergoing ERAD, resulting in insufficient CFTR at the cell surface and the consequent clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis (20.Zheng F. Kartner N. Lukacs G.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 21.Qu B.H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This defect of folding can be partially corrected in living mammalian cells by growth in medium containing chemical chaperones, small molecules that promote the folding of proteins both in vivo and in vitro (22.Brown C.R. Hong-Brown L.Q. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Welch W.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 23.Welch W.J. Brown C.R. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Similarly, defective trafficking of a mutant version of the HERG potassium channel is corrected in vivo following treatment with glycerol (24.Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31123-31126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). These and other studies indicate that the effect of chemical chaperones can be used as a criterion for poor folding of a protein under study. Specifically, our model predicts that in conditions that promote degradation, Hmg2p would be stabilized by chemical chaperones in the manner of a misfolded protein. Indeed, we have previously shown that glycerol stabilizes Hmg2p in living yeast cells at concentrations appropriate for chemical chaperone activity, indicating that Hmg2p undergoing regulated degradation has features similar to known quality control substrates (18.Gardner R.G. Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4276-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this work we have thoroughly evaluated this action of chemical chaperones on Hmg2p. We show that the in vivo action of glycerol is rapid, reversible and highly specific for Hmg2p. To directly examine the structural effects of chemical chaperones, we have developed an in vitro limited proteolysis assay for Hmg2p in isolated ER microsomes. In vitro, Hmg2p shows a rapid and reversible structural change in response to chemical chaperones, consistent with the idea that Hmg2p is capable of undergoing relevant structural transitions. Furthermore, we show that a similar structural change in Hmg2p occurs when physiological degradation signals are altered in vivo. Thus it appears that Hmg2p has unique features that allow a regulated transition between states that are more and less susceptible to quality control degradation. By this novel mechanism Hmg2p can be modulated by a cellular housekeeping pathway to serve the regulatory needs of the cell.

RHY2803 and RHY2866 were derived from RHY2723 and RHY2842 by transformation with the hrd1Δ::KanMX deletion cassette excised from pRH1122 (17.Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol.

RHY2853 was made by targeted integration of pRH1581 at the StuI site of the ura3-52 locus in the cod1Δ strain RHY1954. RHY2853 was made by targeted integration of plasmid pRH1581 at the StuI site of the ura3-52 locus in a strain in which the COD1 locus was completely deleted via a KanMX cassette. Flow Cytometry of Yeast Cells—Flow cytometry was carried out as described previously (28.Cronin S.R. Khoury A. Ferry D.K. Hampton R.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to early log phase in minimal medium, then incubated with drugs or chemical chaperones for the times indicated and analyzed for individual cell fluorescence with a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer. All histograms in this paper represent results from 10,000 cells. In Vivo Reversibility of Chemical Chaperone Treatment—Cells were grown overnight in minimal medium containing 10% glycerol, then aliquoted into 2-ml samples for each time point. At each time point, cells were pelleted in a clinical centrifuge, medium was removed by aspiration and cells were resuspended into new medium with or without glycerol, as indicated. Cycloheximide was added to 50 μg/ml, then the cultures were returned to incubation for the indicated times. Hmg2p-GFP levels were evaluated by flow cytometry, as indicated above. Reported Hmg2p-GFP levels were determined based on the mean fluorescence of 10,000 cells per time point. Assays for Protein Degradation—Cycloheximide chase was used to measure protein stability as described previously (25.Gardner R. Cronin S. Leader B. Rine J. Hampton R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2611-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to early log phase then spun down, medium removed by aspiration, and replaced with new medium with cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) and with or without glycerol, as indicated. Cultures were then incubated for the indicated times. Samples were collected, lysed, and evaluated by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels, and immunoblotted for the substrate protein under study. Microsome Preparation—Microsomes for limited proteolysis were prepared as follows: Cells were grown in YPD to an OD600 of 0.5–1.0, and 100 ODs pelleted. The pellet was washed once by resuspension in XL buffer (1.2 m sorbitol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 m KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.5), then resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (0.5 ml XL, 2 ml H2O, 260 nm AEBSF, 100 nm TPCK) per 100 ODs, aliquoted into one 2 ml microfuge tube per 10 ODs, mixed with an equal volume 0.5 mm acid-washed glass beads and chilled 2 min on ice. Cells were lysed by vortexing 6 × 1 min, with 1 min on ice between each vortexing. Debris were pelleted by 5-s pulses at 16,000 × g in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes until no pellet was formed (typically three pulses required). From the resulting clarified supernatant, microsomes were pelleted by 30 min at 21,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet overlaid twice with fresh XL buffer, with a 5-min centrifugation following each wash to ensure pellet cohesion. The resulting microsomal pellet was then resuspended in XL buffer with or without glycerol as described under “Results,” for use in the limited proteolysis assay. Limited Proteolysis Assay—This assay was performed on microsomes as follows: trypsin (porcine IX-S, EC 3.4.21.4) was prepared by resuspension of lyophilized powder in SED buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), followed by a 5-min spin at 16,000 × g to pellet any debris. Supernatant was diluted in additional SED to the desired 20× trypsin stock concentration, then added to the final concentration described. Samples were incubated at 30 °C, with 30-μl aliquots removed at the time points indicated, and the reaction halted by addition of 30 μl of 2× USB (75 mm MOPS, pH 6.8; 4% SDS; 200 mm dithiothreitol; 0.2 mg/ml bromphenol blue; 8 m urea) followed by solubilization for 10 min at 55 °C. Samples were resolved on 14% SDS-PAGE, then transferred with 15% methanol to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted for the Myc epitope as described (27.Hampton R.Y. Rine J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). TAME Chromogenic Protease Activity Assay—35 μl of 15 μg/ml trypsin in SED buffer was added to a cuvette containing a mixture of 865 μl of test buffer (XL buffer with glycerol as indicated) and 100 μl of 10 mmp-toluene sulfonyl-l-arginine methyl ester (TAME), then absorbance at 247 nm measured at the indicated time points. The sensitivity of Hmg2p degradation to chemical chaperones is an important indicator of the mechanism of its regulated degradation. In this work we have characterized this response, both in vivo and in vitro. We have taken advantage of Hmg2p-GFP, a normally regulated version of Hmg2p in which the catalytic domain that is nonessential for regulation has been replaced with GFP. The use of this protein allows precise quantitation of regulation, and obviates concerns about possible interactions of drugs or pathway molecules with the catalytic domain, which might conceivably affect Hmg2p structure in a manner unrelated to regulated degradation, a process we know to be mediated solely by the N-terminal transmembrane region (26.Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5994-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 27.Hampton R.Y. Rine J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) Glycerol stabilizes Hmg2p undergoing normal, physiologically regulated degradation. This effect is most evident in strains with high FPP levels, in which the degradation rate of Hmg2p is high. Rapid degradation is promoted by co-expression of a free, soluble HMGR catalytic domain, providing high HMGR activity and thus a high level of FPP-derived degradation signal. The degraded Hmg2p-GFP is expressed from the constitutive TDH3 promoter so that any effects on its steady-state level are due solely to changes in degradation rate. Hmg2p-GFP stability is thus directly indicated by the steady-state cellular fluorescence as measured by flow cytometry, a technique we routinely employ (10.Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P.

A.). 1997; 94: 12944-12948Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). When the strain expressing rapidly degraded Hmg2p-GFP was treated with glycerol, the steady-state levels of Hmg2p-GFP rose rapidly due to stabilization by the chemical chaperone. Glycerol stabilization of Hmg2p-GFP was dose-dependent, saturable, and occurred at concentrations appropriate for its action as a chemical chaperone (Fig. 1A). The extent of the stabilizing effect was similar to that caused by lowering the FPP-derived signal with lovastatin, and the stabilizing effects of glycerol and lovastatin were not additive, as measured by flow cytometry and biochemically (18.Gardner R.G. Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4276-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Hmg2p-GFP was also stabilized by similar concentrations of other typical chemical chaperones, including sorbitol and mannitol (data not shown). Two others, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and 4-phenylbutyric acid, had untoward effects on the cells that precluded in vivo analysis. We next examined the specificity of this effect for Hmg2p. We have previously shown that HRD-dependent degradation of 6myc-Hmg2p, a severely misfolded version of Hmg2p with a transmembrane span replaced by six tandem Myc epitopes, is unaffected by concentrations of glycerol that stabilize Hmg2p (18.Gardner R.G. Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4276-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the selectivity of this effect we tested glycerol action on several other ERAD substrates, including CPY*, a non-folding mutant of carboxypeptidase Y (30.Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), Ole1p (31.Braun S. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Thoms S. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), a natural multispanning membrane protein that undergoes ERAD that is not dependent on either of two known ER ligases, Hrd1p or Doa10p, and Hrd1p, which undergoes self-ubiquitination and degradation in the absence of Hrd3p (16.Gardner R.G.

In all cases, glycerol had minimal effect on ER degradation of these various test substrate"
https://openalex.org/W2081635407,"In steroid biosynthesis, human dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase (DHEA-ST) in the adrenals has been reported to catalyze the transfer of the sulfonate group from 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). DHEA and its sulfate play roles as steroid precursors; however, the role of the enzyme in the catabolism of androgens is poorly understood. Androsterone sulfate is clinically recognized as one of the major androgen metabolites found in urine. Here it is demonstrated that this enzyme recognizes androsterone (ADT) as a cognate substrate with similar kinetics but a 2-fold specificity and stronger substrate inhibition than DHEA. The structure of human DHEA-ST in complex with ADT has been solved at 2.7 Å resolution, confirming ADT recognition. Structural analysis has revealed the binding mode of ADT differs from that of DHEA, despite the similarity of the overall structure between the ADT and the DHEA binary complexes. Our results identify that this human enzyme is an ADT sulfotransferase as well as a DHEA sulfotransferase, implying an important role in steroid homeostasis for the adrenals and liver.

Our results identify that this human enzyme is an ADT sulfotransferase as well as a DHEA sulfotransferase, implying an important role in steroid homeostasis for the adrenals and liver. Sulfonation is catalyzed by a family of sulfotransferases that conjugate a sulfonate group (SO3) from 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) 1The abbreviations used are: PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone; ADTS, androsterone sulfate; DHEAS, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate; ADT, androsterone; DHEA-ST, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase; PAP, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphate; EST, estrogen sulfotransferase; HSD, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; r.m.s., root mean-squared.1The abbreviations used are: PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone; ADTS, androsterone sulfate; DHEAS, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate; ADT, androsterone; DHEA-ST, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase; PAP, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphate; EST, estrogen sulfotransferase; HSD, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; r.m.s., root mean-squared. to a hydroxyl group of the recipient molecule. With desulfation by sulfatases, sulfonation has been considered as one of the major enzymatic reactions in the metabolism not only of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics, but also of steroid hormones. In most cases, the transfer of the charged sulfonate moiety to an acceptor steroid decreases the biological activity of the steroid. Indeed, steroid sulfates resulting from this reaction are not capable of binding to or activating steroid receptors. In addition, the sulfonation reaction increases water solubility of steroids and thereby enhances their excretion into the urine and/or bile (1.Strott C.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 670-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 2.Falany C.N. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 206-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar).Human dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase (DHEA-ST; SULT2A1; EC 2.8.2.2) was identified mainly from human liver and adrenals, using Northern blot analysis (3.Luu-The V. Dufort I. Paquet N. Reimnitz G. Labrie F. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and RT-PCR analysis (4.Javitt N.B. Lee Y.C. Shimizu C. Fuda H. Strott C.A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2978-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A single isoform of DHEA-ST from human liver and adrenal tissues was confirmed by the expression and purification of the enzyme from these organs (5.Falany C.N. Vazquez M.E. Kalb J.M. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 6.Adams J.B. McDonald D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 567: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), molecular cloning studies (7.Whittemore R.M. Pearce L.B. Roth J.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2477-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and the comparison study of the physical, kinetic, and immunological properties of liver and adrenal forms of the enzyme (8.Comer K.A. Falany C.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 645-651PubMed Google Scholar). Steroid sulfonation has been recognized as an important means for maintaining steroid hormone levels in their metabolism. In humans, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) is the most prodigious steroid precursor and one of the major secretory products of both adult and fetal adrenals. In the fetoplacental-maternal unit (the unique interdependence of fetus, placenta, and mother) shown in Scheme 1, DHEAS plays an important role as the major precursor for placental estrogen biosynthesis, thus maintaining pregnancy. A considerable amount of DHEAS is mainly produced from the fetal zone in the adrenal gland (9.Seron-Ferre M. Lawrence C.C. Siiteri P.K. Jaffe R.B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.. 1978; 47: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Then DHEAS is hydroxylated primarily in the fetal liver and partly in the fetal adrenal itself (10.Perez-Palacios G. Perez A.E. Jaffe R.B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.. 1968; 28: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the placenta, the hydroxylated DHEAS is desulfated and aromatized to form estriol, which increases uteroplacental blood flow, and then is secreted into the maternal circulation (11.Goebelsmann U. Jaffe R.B. Acta Endocrinol. (Copenh). 1971; 66: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Androsterone sulfate (ADTS) is the most abundant circulating 5α-reduced androgen metabolite in serum (12.Zwicker H. Rittmaster R.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 76: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), while DHEAS is the major precursor for the active steroid hormones. A fraction of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is metabolized in liver, resulting in androstenedione and the double bond of the latter compound is reduced by 5α-reductase, giving rise to 5α- and 5β-androstanedione. The reduction of the ketone and conjugation reaction at C3 produces mainly 5α-androsterone (ADT) and etiocholanolone (or 5β-ADT), glucurono- and sulfo-conjugates, among various metabolites. More interestingly, the major portion of testosterone is oxidized to androstenedione in liver, following the same metabolism as described above (13.Milgrom E. Baulieu E-E. Kelly P.A. Steroid Hormones. Chapman and Hall, New York and London1990: 398-402Google Scholar). With other conjugation reaction, ADT sulfonation has been considered as one of the major catabolism processes of androgens in human liver before urinary excretion since a considerable amount of ADTS was identified in urine (14.De la Torre R. de la Torre X. Alia C. Segura J. Baro T. Torres-Rodriguez J.M. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is quite interesting that a steroid sulfotransferase enzyme, other than DHEA-ST, responsible for ADT sulfonation in human liver has not been reported so far. This interested us to do a detailed kinetic study on DHEA-ST for various steroids, among which ADT was found to exert a similar activity and substrate inhibition pattern. The latter resulted in reexamination of specificity and substrate inhibition for ADT and DHEA by this enzyme. The two steroids seem quite similar viewing from the plan of the steroid core. However, when looking in detail, a DHEA molecule is stereospecifically distinct from an ADT molecule in their A rings: DHEA as a 3β-hydroxysteroid and ADT as a 3α-hydroxysteroid (Fig. 1). This stereospecific difference has intrigued us in view of the binding mode of both steroids in the substrate binding site of DHEA-ST.Fig. 1Comparison of two stereospecific substrates, DHEA and ADT. Both steroids are compared in two dimensional (A) and three-dimensional (B) structures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Until now, two crystal structures of the enzyme have been available: SULT2A1 in complex with 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphate (PAP) (the PAP complex) (15.Pedersen L.C. Petrotchenko E.V. Negishi M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and DHEA-ST in complex with DHEA (the DHEA complex) (16.Rehse P. Zhou M. Lin S.X. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).In this study, we report the crystallographic structure of the enzyme in complex with ADT, a 3α-hydroxysteroid, and describe enzyme kinetics addressing substrate specificity and substrate inhibition patterns toward DHEA and ADT.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—DHEA, ADT, and PAPS were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (9,11-3H (N))-ADT (54 Ci/mmol) and (4-14C)-DHEA (53 mCi/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Scintillation mixture solution, glutathione-Sepharose 4B, Q-Sepharose fast flow, and Factor Xa were from Amersham Biosciences.Purification and Sulfotransferase Assay—Preparation of homogeneous DHEA-ST was performed as described previously (17.Chang H.J. Zhou M. Lin S.X. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In brief, human DHEA-ST expressed as a glutathione sulfotransferase fusion form from Escherichia coli was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography, a Factor Xa cleavage step, and Q Sepharose anion exchange column chromatography. Purified protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and stored at –20 °C with 50% glycerol before using. No big change for the sulfating activity was observed during storage.DHEA-ST activity assay was performed as mentioned previously (17.Chang H.J. Zhou M. Lin S.X. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with little modification. DHEA-ST activity was assayed at 37 °C at various time intervals in a final reaction volume of 150 μl containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 50 μm PAPS, 2% ethanol, and various amounts of steroids. The reaction was stopped by adding the equivalent volume of xylene, vortexing, and centrifuging for 10 min at 3000 rpm to divide into the aqueous and the solvent phases. The phases were completely separated with ethanol-dry ice bath. Each phase of 80 μl was used to determine the amount of sulfate-conjugated steroids by liquid scintillation counting in a Beckman LS 3801 (Irvine, CA). One unit of enzyme is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 nmol of each steroid sulfate per min under the conditions mentioned above.Kinetic Studies and Data Processing—All reactions were performed at 37 °C and pH 7.5 using 0.1–6.25 μg of enzyme, a wide range of the steroid concentrations (0.05–40 μm) and a saturating concentration of the cofactor, PAPS, (50 μm) in the reaction mixture. The initial velocities were measured with less than 10% substrate conjugation. For the determination of all the kinetic constants, at least 2–3 independent experiments were performed and then the mean value was taken.Initial velocity data in the range of non-inhibitory substrate concentrations (for DHEA and ADT) were first individually fitted to the Michaelis-Menten Equation 1. Michaelis constant (Km) and Maximal velocity (Vmax) for all the steroids examined were calculated using the corresponding double-reciprocal plots (Equation 2). Data for substrate inhibition were fitted to substrate inhibition in Equation 3 (18.Cornish-Bowden A. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 118-122Google Scholar). The real maximal velocity (Vmax) and the substrate concentration at that velocity were calculated by Equations 4 and 5 that were derived mathematically from Equation 3 (19.Gangloff A. Garneau A. Huang Y.W. Lin S.X. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 269-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). v=V[S]/(Km+[S])(Eq. 1) 1/v=Km[S]V+1/V(Eq. 2) v=V[S]/{Km+[S](1+[S]/Kis)}(Eq. 3) Vmax=V/{1+2√(Km/Kis)}(Eq. 4) s=√(KmKis)(Eq. 5) v is the experimentally determined initial velocity, V is the maximal velocity, [S] is the concentration of the variable substrate, Km is the concentration of substrate at half-maximal velocity, Kis is the substrate inhibition constant, Vmax is the real maximal velocity calculated theoretically, and s is the substrate concentration at which the real maximal velocity is reached. The molecular mass of the monomer used to calculate the kcat value was 34 kDa (5.Falany C.N. Vazquez M.E. Kalb J.M. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 17.Chang H.J. Zhou M. Lin S.X. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Crystallization and Data Collection—DHEA-STs were co-crystallized with ADT using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique at room temperature (20.Zhou M. Rehse P. Chang H.J. Luu-The V. Lin S.X. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1630-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Proteins were concentrated at 15 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (β-OG). Drops were prepared by mixing equal volumes of protein and reservoir solutions consisting of 1.6 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.1 m sodium chloride. Then 0.27 μlof10mm ADT was added to the drop. The crystals appeared after 2–3 days and matured in 7–10 days. Diffraction data were collected from one cryo-cooled crystal at beamline X8C at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory while the crystal was oscillated through 1o steps. The ADT complex crystal belongs to orthorhombic space group P21212 with unit cell dimensions of a = 75.3 Å, b = 129.8 Å, c = 44.3 Å. The data were processed using HKL suite (21.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar).Structure Determination and Model Refinement—Structure solution was determined by molecular replacement using the CNS software package (22.Brünger A.T.

We used the refined 2.5 Å resolution structure of the human DHEA-ST in complex with DHEA (accession code 1J99 in Protein Data Bank) as the starting model. The initial electron density maps were calculated using 2Fo – Fc and Fo – Fc coefficients (where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factors respectively). The model was updated until completion using the CNS software package for refinement (22.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). After the structure was rebuilt and refined by several cycles, the electron density corresponding to ADT and sulfate group was clear enough to put the two molecules in the substrate binding site and the cofactor-binding site respectively. The stereochemistry of the final model was verified with the program PROCHECK (24.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Details of the data collection and refinement statistics for the model are given in Table I.

In the inserts of Fig. 2, the initial velocity increases with substrate concentrations up to 2 μm for ADT and 4–6 μm for DHEA and then decreases with increasing substrate concentrations, identifying a substrate inhibition pattern. At very high substrate concentrations, this velocity reaches a minimum level of 30 units/mg for ADT and 40 units/mg for DHEA, rather than falling to zero. As depicted in Fig. 2, the Lineweaver-Burk plots are by no means linear compared with those of general Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Three regions of the plots can generally be discerned: the region that follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the transition region, and the substrate inhibition region. At low concentrations of DHEA (2 μm and lower) and ADT (1 μm and lower), the double-reciprocal plot gives a linear range that follows the Michaelis-Menten equation. The sulfonation reaction was largely inhibited when higher concentrations of DHEA (20 μm and higher) and ADT (10 μm and higher) were used and 1/v value increased rapidly following the decrease of 1/S value (the increase of substrate concentration) in this range. A transition phase of 1–10 μm for ADT and 2–20 μm for DHEA showed the transfer from the Michaelis-Menten zone to the substrate inhibition area. The kinetic constants were calculated when the whole range of experimental data was analyzed by the substrate inhibition equation v = V × [S]/{Km + [S](1+[S]/Kis)} (Table II). We can see that the enzyme catalyzes the transfer of sulfonate group from PAPS toward ADT with a Km = 2.1 ± 0.5 μm and kcat = 0.13 ± 0.02 s–1 while the kinetic constants for the DHEA molecule are Km = 3.1 ± 0.7 μm and kcat = 0.1 ± 0.015 s–1. The specificity (kcat/Km) of ADT is twice that of DHEA as shown in Table II, indicating that ADT is at least as specific as DHEA for the enzyme. Moreover at a certain high concentration range of ADT (Kis = 3.8 ± 0.9 μm), substrate inhibition is induced as in the case of DHEA (Kis = 10.6 ± 2.4 μm), which is a unique feature in the sulfotransferase family (26.Otterness D.M.

Biochem. 1980; 107: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In comparison to DHEA sulfonation, ADT is now identified as a cognate substrate to which the enzyme shows even somewhat higher specificity and stronger substrate inhibition, as presented in this work. Maximal velocities of 180.3 ± 27.1 units/mg for DHEA and 221.1 ± 36.4 units/mg for ADT, which correspond to the kcat values for the Michaelis-Menten reaction, cannot be reached directly in the experiment owing to substrate inhibition. In reality, experimental maximal velocity for the whole reaction was around 90 units/mg for both steroids before substrate inhibition begins as shown in Fig. 2. These values are very consistent with the theoretical values of 88.4 units/mg for ADT and 90.2 units/mg for DHEA obtained using the Equation 4. The substrate concentration at the real maximum velocity was also determined to be 2.82 μm for ADT and 5.73 μm for DHEA using Equation 5 mentioned under “Experimental Procedures.” These values are in good agreement with the observed substrate concentration at the maximum point for the curve drawn in Fig. 2.Fig. 2Lineweaver-Burk plot for steroid sulfonation with DHEA (A) and ADT (B) as the substrate. Steroid sulfonation was determined using concentrations of both steroids varying from 0.05–40 μm. The concave shape of the curve no longer reflects standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics but shows substrate inhibition at higher concentrations of the steroids (DHEA above 4 μm and ADT 2 μm). The inset shows the v versus s plot for the same reaction. Each point was determined from at least duplicate assay data.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIData collection, structural and refinement statisticsParametersValuesUnit cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)75.29, 129.82, 44.29Space groupP21212Number of reflections36,310 (3571)Unique reflections11,911 (1189)Resolution (Å)20-2.70 (2.80-2.70)Completeness (%)95.2 (96.7)I/σ (1)11.3 (2.1)Rmerge*0.075 (0.424)Multiplicity3.1 (3.0)R-factor23.0R-free27.1Rms deviations from target geometryBond lengths (Å)0.007Bond angles (o)1.3Mean B factors and number of non-hydrogen atomsAll atoms58.14/2188Protein58.05/2137Sulfate71.40/5ADT73.19/21Water50.96/25 Open table in a new tab Overall Structure—The crystal structures of human DHEA-ST have been reported in the presence of DHEA (16.Rehse P. Zhou M. Lin S.X. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and PAP (15.Pedersen L.C. Petrotchenko E.V. Negishi M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here the ADT binary complex structure is determined. The overall structure of the enzyme includes an ADT molecule and a modeled PAP, showing both substrate and expected cofactor binding sites (Fig. 3). The overall structure of the ADT complex is very similar to that of the DHEA complex except for some residues and the flexible loops. The root mean square deviation value between the two structures is 0.935 for the α-carbon of 267 amino acids excluding the two flexible loops formed by residues Asn-226 to Asp-237 and Leu-246 to Val-250. All data between 20 and 2.70 Å were used in the refinement, yielding a crystallographic R-factor of 23.0% and a free R-factor of 27.0%. There is one monomer in the asymmetric unit even though the active protein is a homodimer in solution (5.Falany C.N. Vazquez M.E. Kalb J.M. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 17.Chang H.J. Zhou M. Lin S.X. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The main core of the ADT complex structure is composed of an α/β-fold with a central four-stranded parallel β-sheet surrounded by α-helices on both sides as described in a previous report (15.Pedersen L.C. Petrotchenko E.V. Negishi M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The refined model includes one DHEA-ST monomer, an ADT molecule and a sulfate molecule. In addition, the model includes 25 water molecules. Out of the 284 amino acids contained in the protein, 267 were modeled into the electron density in the present structure while 284 amino acids were built in the DHEA complex structure. The missing amino acids belong to loop regions that could not be built in the ADT complex structure. The Ramachandran plot showed that all residues are in allowed regions with 87.2% in the most favored regions.Fig. 3The overall structure of DHEA-ST. ADT is colored in magenta and modeled PAP in cyan, showing both substrate and expected cofactor binding sites. This image was produced using SETOR (35.Evans S.V. J. Mol. Graphics. 1993; 11: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Substrate Binding Site—The present ADT binary complex structure is compared with both the PAP-DHEA-ST structure (the PAP binary complex structure) and the DHEA binary complex structure. The 2Fo – Fc electron density map contoured at 1 σ level enables the unambiguous localization of an ADT molecule (Fig. 4) and a sulfate group (Fig. 6) bound to DHEA-ST in the substrate binding and the cofactor binding sites respectively. The ADT complex structure has only one substrate orientation in the active site while two distinct orientations, the catalytic and the alternative, have been proposed in the DHEA complex structure (Fig. 5) (16.Rehse P. Zhou M. Lin S.X. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Superimposing the two structures shows that an ADT molecule as a whole is close to the location of the DHEA molecule in the proposed alternative orientation. In the ADT complex structure, no electron density for the proposed catalytic orientation has been found since the Cϵ atom of Met-137 residue is inward the substrate binding site and results in steric hindrance against the proposed catalytic location of the DHEA molecule (Fig. 5). The active site for the sulfonation reaction is identified through the position of O-3 of ADT, which functions as a sulfonate acceptor (Fig. 5). There is little displacement of O-3 atom between the DHEA complex and the ADT complex structures (1.04 Å for the distance between O-3 of ADT and O-3 of DHEA in the alternative orientation, 1.74 Å between O-3 of ADT and O-3 of DHEA in the catalytic orientation). A hydrogen bond (3.0 Å) between O-3 of ADT and Nϵ-2 of His-99 in DHEA-ST is identified similar to that between DHEA and His-99 in the DHEA complex structure (Fig. 5). This histidine is strongly conserved among several sulfotransferase families, including EST, phenol sulfotransferase, and flavonol 3-sulfotransferase, suggesting its catalytic role (15.Pedersen L.C. Petrotchenko E.V. Negishi M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Until now, the ADT complex and the DHEA complex structures are quite similar. If so, what is the main difference between the two structures in the catalytic center of DHEA-ST? As shown in Fig. 6, the main difference between the two structures is the steroid orientation: the ADT molecule is flipped over 180° around its long axis, in comparison to the DHEA molecule of the alternative orientation. Several factors have been involved in the flip-flop of the ADT molecule. Primarily, this takes place in order to favor the making of a hydrogen bond between O-3 of ADT and Nϵ-2 of His-99 of the enzyme. If the ADT molecule is in the same plane as the DHEA molecule considering the orientation of C-18 and C-19 atoms, O-3 of ADT (α-position) would be far away from Nϵ-2 atom with the distance of 4.6 Å due to the stereospecific difference of A ring. Therefore the hydrogen bond between O-3 of ADT and Nϵ-2 of His-99 of DHEA-ST in the ADT complex structure cannot be made. The present crystallographic data indicate that human DHEA-ST does not provide stereospecific discrimination between an O-3 α steroid (ADT) and an O-3 β steroid (DHEA), thereby supporting our kinetic results (Table II). On the contrary, guinea pig DHEA-STs showed stereospecificity, based on the comparative enzymatic study with DHEA and ADT (29.Driscoll W.J. Martin B.M. Chen H.C. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23496-23503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Park B.C. Lee Y.C. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21562-21568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Secondly, O-17 of ADT establishes another hydrogen bond (3.28 Å) with the hydroxyl group of Ser-80 that stabilizes the ADT molecule in this position (Fig. 5). No hydrogen bond for the O-17 atom of DHEA has been found in the DHEA complex structure. Third, several hydrophobic residues are found in the vicinity of the substrate binding site (within 6 Å). Among them, the Phe-133, Trp-134, Phe-18, and Trp-72 residues are involved in van der Waals interactions with the ADT molecule. Fourth, the side chain of Trp-77 is juxtaposed with ADT at a distance of around 4 Å, indicating that this residue provides another important interaction for ADT orientation (Fig. 6).

Cys32 and His105 in the N-terminal domain of CvaB were identified as critical residues for both colicin V secretion and cysteine proteolytic activity. By inhibiting degradation with N-ethylmaleimide and a mixture of protease inhibitors, a stable wild-type N-terminal domain (which showed cysteine protease activity when activated) was purified. Such protease activity was Ca2+- and concentration-dependent and could be inhibited by antipain, N-ethylmaleimide, EDTA, and EGTA. At low concentrations, the Ca2+ analogs Tb3+ and La3+ (but not Fe3+) significantly enhanced proteolytic activity, suggesting that the size of the cations is important for activity. Together with comparisons of the sequences of members of the cysteine protease family, these results indicate that Cys32 and His105 are the critical residues in the CvaB N-terminal domain for the calcium-dependent cysteine protease activity and secretion of colicin V.

These transporters constitute one of the largest protein families found in living organisms. Members of this family transport a wide variety of compounds, including sugars, ions, antibiotics, and peptides (3.Decottignies A. Goffeau A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 4.Holland I.B. Blight M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Some members of this family, such as the multidrug resistance protein, P-glycoprotein (which is involved in pumping out anticancer drugs), and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (which, when defective, leads to this deadly inherited disease), are clinically relevant (5.Bobadilla J.L. Macek Jr., M. Fine J.P. Farrell P.M. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 575-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 6.Greger R. Schreiber R. Mall M. Wissner A. Hopf A. Briel M. Bleich M. Warth R. Kunzelmann K. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 443: S3-S7PubMed Google Scholar). Most ABC transporters consist of two hydrophobic transmembrane domains, which contain 6–12 membrane-spanning α-helices and provide the specificity for the substrates that cross the membrane. They also contain two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains, which bind and hydrolyze ATP to provide the energy for translocating substrates (1.Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar). A highly conserved region among all ABC transporters is found within the nucleotide-binding domain (∼30% identity), which contains Walker A and B motifs separated by ∼90–120 amino acids and a signature C motif located upstream of the Walker B site (7.Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 8.Dean M. Rzhetsky A. Allikmets R.

Well studied examples of ABC transporters in prokaryotes are the histidine permease complex of Salmonella typhimurium HisQMP2 (9.Jones P.M. George A.M. FEMS Microbiol.

Trends Biotechnol. 1994; 12: 450-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The colicin V system consists of a toxin gene (cvaC) that encodes a 103-amino acid precursor protein, the first 15 residues of which are cleaved behind two glycine residues of the leader peptide during secretion (16.James R. Lazdunski F. Pattus F. Bacteriocins, Microcins, and Lantibiotics. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1992Crossref Google Scholar, 19.Havarstein L.S. Diep D.B. Nes I.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). A second gene (cvaB) that encodes the central ABC membrane transporter protein is predicted to have an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain that is conserved among bacteriocin ABC transporters; it has been proposed to possess the protease activity that cleaves the leader peptide (14.Gilson L. Mahanty H.K. Kolter R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3875-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 18.Fath M.J. Kolter R. Microbiol.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1347-1353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal domains of the similar Lactococcus bacteriocin transporters have been proposed to be essential for substrate recognition and processing (19.Havarstein L.S. Diep D.B. Nes I.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that processing ColV-1 in membrane vesicles is dependent on the CvaA-CvaB transporter and TolC proteins and that this activity is sensitive to inhibition by the serine/cysteine protease inhibitor antipain and the cysteine protease inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (21.Zhong X. Kolter R. Tai P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28057-28063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 22.Hwang J. Manuvakhova M. Tai P.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 689-696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because neither CvaA nor ColV-1 contains a cysteine residue (14.Gilson L. Mahanty H.K. Kolter R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3875-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 23.Fath M.J. Zhang L.H. Ruth J. Kolter R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6911-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), CvaB is probably the target of inhibition of NEM and antipain. Sequence similarities indicate that the CvaB N-terminal domain (BntD) belongs to the cysteine protease calpain family. The catalytic residues in this family are believed to be Cys and His (24.Reverter D. Sorimachi H. Bode W. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2001; 11: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25.Glading A. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A.

In this study, we identified the residues of BntD that are critical for colicin V secretion, and we show that wild-type BntD (but not certain Cys or His BntD mutants) possesses calcium-dependent cysteine peptidase activity.

The standard PCR contained 20 ng of linearized plasmid template, 400 ng of each oligonucleotide primer, 200 μm each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and 5 units of ExTaq DNA polymerase (PanVera/TaKaRa, Madison, WI) in 1× buffer provided by the manufacturer in a total volume of 50 μl. The PCR mixture was amplified by 35 cycles of 20 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 50 °C, and 1 min at 70 °C, followed by one cycle of 10 min at 72 °C. Following the reaction, PCR amplification products were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kits (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA), resolved by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel in 40 mm Tris acetate and 1 mm EDTA in the presence of ethidium bromide, and isolated from the gel using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc.). To generate the desired site-directed mutagenesis constructs, a three-round asymmetric PCR strategy was used (30.Tzeng W.-P. Frey T.K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3189-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For example, to generate the H105D mutation, asymmetric PCR using mutagenic primer kw71 containing 29 nucleotides of CvaB sequence and BglII-linearized pHK11 template was performed to synthesize a single-stranded DNA in the first round. This single-stranded DNA, extended from the mutation through the BglII site at nucleotide 3874 of the ColV operon, was used as a template for a second round of asymmetric PCR primed with primer kw61 to amplify a complementary strand to the first round PCR product. In the third round of PCR, 20 ng of BglII-linearized pHK11 template was combined with 2 μl of the second round PCR product and primer kw60 to generate a symmetric double-stranded DNA product. The amplification products were digested with SacI and KpnI, and the 513-nucleotide fragment was used for subcloning into the same sites in vector pTrcHis2B, generating a new plasmid, pKW21. To incorporate the mutation into full-length CvaB, the SacI-PstI fragment containing 471 nucleotides from the new plasmid pKW21 was used to replace the corresponding fragment in wild-type CvaB. To introduce the FLAG epitope into wild-type CvaB, forward primer kw45 and backward primer kw106 containing eight amino acids of the FLAG epitope and the BglII restriction site were used to perform a standard PCR. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing using an ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) and appropriate primers. Sequencing reaction products were purified on Centrisep columns (Princeton Separations, Adelphia, NJ). Sequencing was performed using an ABI 377 or 3100 Sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.) in the Georgia State University Biology Core Facilities. Gel Electrophoresis, Western Blotting, and Peptide Sequencing— Standard SDS-acrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to the method of Laemmli (31.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, electrophoresed proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Applied Biosystems Inc.) and treated by established procedures for Western blotting (32.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) was used as the secondary antibody. For N-terminal peptide sequencing, spots from gels transferred by CAPS transfer buffer (2.213 g of CAPS in 1 liter of deionized water, pH 11) were sequenced in the Georgia State University Peptide Sequencing Facility using an Applied Biosystems Procise Sequencer. Overproduction and Purification of BntD for Eliciting Antibodies— BL21 cells containing the pKW21 plasmid were grown overnight in ampicillin-containing TB medium at 37 °C and diluted to A600 nm ∼ 0.1. At A600 nm ∼ 0.5, the pKW21-containing BL21 cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to overproduce H105D BntD, and the cells were harvested 4 h later by centrifugation at 11,300 × g for 8 min at 4 °C. The purification procedure was based on the manufacturer's specifications (Invitrogen) with minor modifications as follows. For inclusion body purification, the cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mm NH4OAc, 40 mm KOAc, and 5 mm Mg(OAc)2 and then passed twice through a French press (17,000 p.s.i.), followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet containing overproduced 22-kDa BntD in inclusion bodies was washed sequentially with 1 and 2 m urea and then extracted with 6 m urea containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. The supernatant was loaded onto a 2-ml nickel-chelate column (Invitrogen) and mixed with the resin by rocking for 30 min. The breakthrough fraction was collected and reapplied to the column, with rocking for 15 min. The resin was settled in the column, which was then washed with 40 ml of wash buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 6 m urea, and 500 mm NaCl) by resuspending the resin, rocking for 2 min, and then draining the resin by gravity. The column was washed once with wash buffer plus 0.1 m imidazole and eluted with 2 ml of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 m urea, and 0.3 m imidazole); the resin was rocked for 15 min. The eluent was collected by gravity and used for generating antibodies. Pieces containing 22-kDa BntD were excised from gels developed by 15% SDS-PAGE and ground into suspension. The purified protein (1.5 mg) was used for the primary injection with Freund's adjuvant, followed by boosters; serum preparations were prepared by general standard procedures (32.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), and anti-BntD antibodies were further purified using acetone powder (32.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Purification of Soluble BntD for Enzyme Assay—Cells harboring wild-type plasmid pKW24, H105D-expressing plasmid pKW21, or C32S-expressing plasmid pKW26 were grown and induced by IPTG as described above. The induction time was shortened to 1.5 h to reduce formation of inclusion bodies, and no urea was used in the preparations. The cell pellets harvested were resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate and 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.8) plus complete protease inhibitors and 1 mm NEM. The cells were lysed and centrifuged as described above. The supernatant containing induced soluble proteins was applied to the 2-ml nickel-chelate column and then washed twice with binding buffer, followed by binding buffer at pH 6.0. The proteins were eluted sequentially with 1 ml of 50, 200, 350, and 500 mm imidazole elution buffer. The samples eluted with 500 mm imidazole elution buffer containing BntD were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and kept at –70 °C in small aliquots for the protease cleavage assay. Purified wild-type BntD, C32S BntD, and H105D BntD were verified by peptide sequencing and immunodetection. In Vitro Protease Cleavage Assay—The standard assays were as follow. Purified BntD (normally 4.32 μg) was preincubated with 100 μl of cleavage reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C for 10 min (33.Rank K.B. Mildner A.M. Leone J.W. Koeplinger K.A. Chou K.C. Tomasselli A.G. Heinrikson R.L. Sharma S.K. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 22: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 34.Gafni J.

The substrate l-arginine p-nitroanilide (LAPNA; final concentration of 1 mm) was added to cleavage reaction buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. The assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates (path length of 0.7 cm), and the cleavage product (p-nitroaniline) was monitored at 405 nm using a Beckman Biomek 2000 plate reader spectrophotometer. Background readings of hydrolysis of the substrate without BntD were subtracted. For kinetic analysis, initial rates of enzymatic activity were used. The Vmax and Km values were calculated from nonlinear regression, and the inhibition constant (Ki) was determined from IC50 by fitting the data using GraphPAD Prism software. Identification of Critical Residues in Cysteine Peptidase BntD—By comparing the nucleotide sequence of BntD with those of other protease families, it seems likely that BntD belongs to the cysteine protease calpain family (Fig. 1), which contains cysteine and histidine as active sites and presumably asparagine as part of triad residues. A homology search of the cysteine residues in the N-terminal domain involved in proteolysis and colicin V secretion showed that Cys32 may correspond to the active-site nucleophile Cys105 of calpain because it is conserved in the motif GDC(W/G) (Fig. 1). To investigate the role of Cys32, it was replaced with Ser or Ala. As shown in Fig. 2, neither the serine nor alanine mutant had the colicin V secretion activity of the wild type. The other cysteine residues in the domain (Cys36, Cys41, and Cys97) were similarly tested; each had normal colicin V secretion activity (Fig. 2A), suggesting that Cys32 is indeed the critical cysteine residue for colicin V secretion.Fig. 2Identification of critical residues for colicin V secretion system. A, four N-terminal domain cysteine residue and two histidine residue mutations. Wild-type pKW67 and full-length ColV operon-expressing pHK11 showed the same secretion results. pHK11-4 has the CvaB deletion; mutations at Cys32 and His105 lost secretion activity. a, the name of the mutation represents the amino acid change. B, ColV secretion shown as a clear zone. C, stability assay of CvaA and CvaB.

Anti-CvaA and anti-FLAG antibodies were used against CvaA and CvaB, respectively. Lane 1, wild-type BntD; lane 2, C32S mutant; lane 3, H105D mutant; lane 4, pHK11-4 (CvaB deletion).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Moreover, amino acid sequence comparisons showed that His100 and His105 are conserved within the cysteine protease family (Fig. 1). Replacement of His100 with Asp, Ala, Lys, or Ser did not impair normal colicin V secretion activity, but a similar replacement of His105 abolished it (Fig. 2A), indicating that His105 is required for catalytic activity. To verify that Cys32 and His105 mutants are not structurally unstable, we determined CvaB proteins by immunoblotting. The FLAG epitope was introduced into CvaB, which had no effect on the colicin V activity. The results show that CvaB, wild-type CvaA, C32S CvaA, and H105D CvaA were all stable (Fig. 2C). H105D BntD Can Be Stably Induced—We constructed C-terminally His-tagged BntD under the control of the Trc promoter. Cultures containing plasmids encoding wild-type BntD or the H105D mutant were induced. Only the H105D mutant overproduced the product, which was purified by affinity chromatography (Fig. 3); the wild-type domain was not overproduced (data not shown). After the cells were lysed, the inclusion bodies containing H105D mutant proteins were harvested by centrifugation and solubilized by 6 m urea (lane 4). The supernatant was then applied to a His tag affinity column, and the nonspecific binding proteins were removed by washings. The 22-kDa H105D BntD protein was eluted with 0.3 m imidazole and used to elicit antibodies. To detect wild-type BntD and the H105D mutant, samples were collected before and after IPTG induction. As expected, the total cell extracts of the H105D mutant collected after IPTG induction showed a strong immunological reaction, but only weakly before induction, indicating that the H105D mutant was indeed induced (data not shown). On the other hand, wild-type extracts showed little 22-kDa protein even after induction, confirming that it is difficult to detect stable wild-type BntD under the conditions used (data not shown). Stabilization by Treatment with NEM and Purification of Wild-type BntD—We reasoned that because NEM is a cysteine protease inhibitor, it might stabilize wild-type BntD. Adding NEM (1 mm) to the buffer before cell lysis did indeed confer stability. The total cell extracts and inclusion bodies of wild-type BntD contained a 22-kDa protein, which could be detected immunologically. Accordingly, we proceeded to purify wild-type BntD in the presence of NEM. Cells were induced at low temperature for 1.5 h, yielding a soluble supernatant that contained half of the induced proteins, from which we purified wild-type BntD. Its identity (Fig. 3, lane 9) was verified by N-terminal peptide sequencing, confirming the first eight amino acids as -MDPMT-NRN. These preparations were used to test protease activities. BntD Proteolytic Activity Is Time- and Concentration-dependent—Because the sequence homology suggested that BntD is a cysteine protease, a typical substrate (LAPNA) for metallo- and cysteine aminoprotease activities was tested and found to be adequate for enzyme assay of BntD. The cleavage yielded p-nitroanilide, which could be monitored at A405 nm. To characterize proteolytic activity, four concentrations of BntD were tested for various times. At 2.16 μg/100 μl, BntD showed delayed activity, but reached maximal activity at 4.32 μg/100 μl; at 1.08 μg/100 μl, BntD showed low enzymatic activity; and at 0.86 μg/100 μl, BntD showed virtually no activity (Fig. 4). Low enzymatic activities were observed before a 6-h incubation with 2.16 μg of proteins and increased between 12 and 24 h, suggesting that cooperative aggregation or oligomerization of BntD is required for maximal activity. The higher concentration (4 μg) of BntD was used for all subsequent assays. Substrate Specificity—Nα-Benzoyl-dl-arginine p-nitroanilide, a typical serine protease substrate, was compared with LAPNA, a typical substrate for metallo- and cysteine aminoproteases. As expected, Nα-benzoyl-dl-arginine p-nitroanilide was inactive (Fig. 5A), indicating that BntD belongs to the cysteine protease family. The effect of pH on BntD proteolytic activity was also tested, and the results show that BntD proteolysis occurred over a wide pH range, but was optimal at pH 7.5 (Fig. 5B). To further characterize BntD, various concentrations of LAPNA were incubated with BntD in cleavage reaction buffer at 37 °C for 6 h. The activities gradually increased up to 2 mm, reaching saturation at ∼3 mm (Fig. 5C). The rate of hydrolysis of LAPNA was dependent on substrate concentrations, with a Km of 1.15 mm and a Vmax of 91 pmol/min/μg BntD (Fig. 5C). BntD Proteolytic Activity Is Calcium-dependent—As indicated in Fig. 1, the sequence homology suggested that BntD is a cysteine protease calpain-like protein. Calpains, which include the ubiquitously expressed μ- and m-calpains, are a family of Ca2+-dependent intracellular cysteine proteases from mammals, birds, and insects. The product of the sol gene in Drosophila is a calpain (36.Delaney S.J. Hayward D.C. Barleben F. Fischbach K.F. Miklos G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88 (L. G.): 7214-7218GCrossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To test whether BntD indeed requires Ca2+ for activity, different concentrations of CaCl2 were tested. p-Nitroanilide cleavage gradually increased up to 5 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 6A), reaching saturation at 7.5 mm. The data demonstrate that the proteolytic activity of BntD is calcium concentration-dependent. CaCl2 at 5 mm was used in subsequent experiments. It has been reported that the enzymatic activity of a cysteine protease of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobe, is enhanced severalfold by divalent cations such as Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ (37.Kontani M. Ono H. Shibata H. Okamura Y. Tanaka T. Fujiwara T. Kimura S. Hamada S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 756-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested their effect on BntD proteolytic activity. 5 mm CaCl2, MnCl2, and CuCl2 each conferred moderate activity (Fig. 6B). On the other hand, KCl at 50 mm or MgCl2 at 5 mm was less effective, and MgCl2 at 10 mm did not compete with the CaCl2-induced proteolytic activity of BntD (Fig. 6C). ZnSO4 at 5 mm did not enhance any activity. Due to their similar ionic radii, Tb3+ and La3+ have been widely used to compete for calcium binding (38.Horrocks Jr, W.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 226: 495-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We were surprised to find that TbCl3 at 150 μm and LaCl3 at 100 μm were as active as CaCl2 at 5 mm and that LaCl3 at 500 μm was 2-fold more active, but higher concentrations enhanced less activity presumably due to precipitation. At the same concentrations, FeCl3 was inactive. Interestingly, Havarstein et al. (19.Havarstein L.S. Diep D.B. Nes I.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) reported that 250 mm Na2SO4 increases proteolytic cleavage by LagD by 4-fold. We found that it did not enhance the proteolytic activity o"
https://openalex.org/W1992447607,"Cysteine string protein (CSP), a 34-kDa molecular chaperone, is expressed on synaptic vesicles in neurons and on secretory vesicles in endocrine, neuroendocrine, and exocrine cells. CSP can be found in a complex with two other chaperones, the heat shock cognate protein Hsc70, and small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat domain protein (SGT). CSP function is vital in synaptic transmission; however, the precise nature of its role remains controversial. We have previously reported interactions of CSP with both heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) and N-type calcium channels. These associations give rise to a tonic G protein inhibition of the channels. Here we have examined the effects of huntingtin fragments (exon 1) with (huntingtinexon1/exp) and without (huntingtinexon1/nonexp) expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts on the CSP chaperone system. In vitro huntingtinexon1/exp sequestered CSP and blocked the association of CSP with G proteins. In contrast, huntingtinexon1/nonexp did not interact with CSP and did not alter the CSP/G protein association. Similarly, co-expression of huntingtinexon1/exp with CSP and N-type calcium channels eliminated CSP's tonic G protein inhibition of the channels, while coexpression of huntingtinexon1/nonexp did not alter the robust inhibition promoted by CSP. These results indicate that CSP's modulation of G protein inhibition of calcium channel activity is blocked in the presence of a huntingtin fragment with expanded polyglutamine tracts.

Molecular chaperones are best known for assisting nascent polypeptides to fold, for protecting mature proteins from stresses (such as heat shock), and for the transferring of misfolded proteins to the proteasome. They are also important in numerous cellular pathways requiring protein conformation remodeling (e.g. recycling of clathrin-coated pits after endocytosis, Ref. 1Morgan J.R. Prasad K. Jin S. Augustine G.J. Lafer E.M. Neuron. 2001; 32: 289-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). At the synapse, chaperones are important regulators of the dynamic complexes underlying neurotransmitter release and allow for the essential speed and high fidelity of the process. Interference with the normal chaperone function due to altered protein levels or activities would be expected to result in pathological consequences. Recently, chaperones have been implicated in diseases involving both the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins and the degeneration of neurons, such as in Huntington's disease (2Muchowski P.J. Neuron. 2002; 35: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 3Sakahira H. Breuer P. Hayer-Hartl M. Hartl F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16412-16418Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the 350 kDa cytosolic protein huntingtin (4Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group Cell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6954) Google Scholar), which is of unknown but essential function (5Tobin A.J. Signer E.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 531-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The first exon of the huntingtin gene contains a polymorphic expansion of CAG repeats that encodes a polyglutamine tract. The severity of Huntington's disease depends on the length of the glutamine repeats and is invariably terminal. In unaffected individuals the polyglutamine tract typically contains between 6 and 39 repeats compared with 36-250 repeats in patients with Huntington's disease. Huntington's disease is a member of a class of eight human polyglutamine repeat diseases that includes spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 17, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinobulbar muscular atrophy. Huntington's disease manifests in midlife and causes progressive motor, psychiatric, and cognitive dysfunction. Early symptoms of Huntington's include cognitive defects such as memory and information-processing deficits, mood changes, and aggressive behavior. Initially movement impairments involve shaking/dance like movements and at later stages of the disease the muscles become rigid. At autopsy, late stage brains show extensive striatal, pallidal, and cortical atrophy. The initial target of degeneration in Huntington's disease is the striatal medium spiny GABAergic neuron, and by end stages of the disease up to 95% of these neurons are lost (6Vonsattel J.P. Myers R.H. Stevens T.J. Ferrante R.J. Bird E.D. Richardson E.P. J. Neuropathol Exp. Neurol. 1985; 44: 559-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar). Neuronal loss is also observed in the globus pallidus, cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum. Given the ubiquitous distribution of huntingtin, the underlying mechanisms that elicit atrophy in GABAergic neurons and protect against mutant huntingtin-induced atrophy in other cell types is the subject of intense scrutiny.Pathological neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease is directly correlated with the expansion of CAG triplets encoding polyglutamine repeats. Expansion of the polyglutamine tract beyond a critical threshold results in the formation of huntingtin inclusion bodies, one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Huntington's disease. While chaperones have been shown to protect against neurodegeneration by inhibiting the early stages of aggregation (7Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E. Hayer-Hartl M.J. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), the extensive aggregation associated with disease progression is expected to eventually deplete chaperone availability. Exhaustion of molecular chaperones would leave the native targets of chaperones vulnerable to misfolding and result in loss of function.CSP 1The abbreviations used are: CSPcysteine string proteinMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidGSTglutathione S-transferasePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideTEA-Cltetraethylammonium chloride.1The abbreviations used are: CSPcysteine string proteinMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidGSTglutathione S-transferasePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideTEA-Cltetraethylammonium chloride. is a 34-kDa protein present on synaptic vesicles (8Mastrogiacomo A.

Science. 1994; 263: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) demonstrated that CSP plays a significant role in neurotransmitter release. The deletion of CSP in Drosophila was semi-lethal and temperature-dependent. Only 4% of null mutants developed into adulthood at 25 °C, and none survived at 29 °C.We have recently shown that CSP is capable of binding to both the N-type calcium channel and to Gβγ in vitro, and that the interaction between CSP and the N-type calcium channel results in a robust tonic inhibition of channel activity by G protein βγ subunits (18Magga J.M.

Given that proteins with expanded polyglutamine repeats have been proposed to interfere with the chaperone balance of the cell, we have analyzed the effects of huntingtin on CSP modulation of N-type channels. In this study we begin to address the hypothesis that cysteine string protein (CSP) dysfunction might contribute to defects in synaptic transmission or plasticity observed in Huntington's disease. As a first step toward testing this hypothesis, we have examined the chaperone activity of the secretory vesicle chaperone CSP in the presence of huntingtinexon1/exp and huntingtinexon1/nonexp. Our findings demonstrate that mutant huntingtin with an expanded polyglutamine region sequesters CSP and blocks CSP inhibition of N-type channels.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Rat Hippocampal Homogenate—Rat hippocampi were hand homogenized with a teflon coated homogenizer in 0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES KOH (pH 7.0), 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 μm microcystin, 1 μm okadaic acid, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (2 ml/hippocampus). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g, and the supernatant collected and subsequently centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g (4 °C). The pellet, containing the synaptic proteins was resuspended in 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 4.5 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 150 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm PMSF, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 μm microcystin, 1 μm okadaic acid, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Next the homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was discarded. The resulting supernatant is a crude hippocampal homogenate that contains synaptic proteins. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad Protein Assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. All procedures were carried out in strict accordance with a protocol approved by the University of Calgary Animal Care Committee.Preparation of Fusion Proteins—Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of CSP and CSP deletion mutants were prepared as described previously (9Braun J.E. Scheller R.H. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1361-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 12Braun J.E. Wilbanks S.M. Scheller R.H. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar) and was expressed as a GST fusion protein in AB1899 cells. Myc-tagged huntingtin pGEX-HDQ53 and pGEX-HDQ20 fusion protein constructs were prepared as described previously (7Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E. Hayer-Hartl M.J. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) and resulted in the expression of GST followed by the PreScission protease cleavage site (LEVLFQGP), nine vector-derived residues (LGSPEFIMC), a Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) and exon 1 of the human huntingtin gene containing 53 or 20 glutamines, respectively. The sequences of all constructs were verified. pGEX-HD53Q and pGEX-HDQ20 were transformed into SURE cells and expression was induced with 100 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) for 4 h at 28 °C. All other proteins were induced with 100 μm IPTG for 4 h at 37 °C. The bacteria were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4) supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol and lysed by two passages through a French Press (Spectronic Instruments Inc.). The fusion proteins were recovered by binding to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). The fusion protein beads were washed extensively and finally resuspended in 0.2% Triton X-100, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 4.5 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 150 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm PMSF. Recombinant CSP was purified from the agarose beads by cleavage with 0.2 μm thrombin in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2 followed by incubation in 0.3 mm PMSF. Myc-HDQ20 and myc-HD53 proteins were cleaved from the GST fusion protein through incubation with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The concentration of recombinant proteins was estimated by Coomassie Blue or Silver (Bio-Rad) staining of protein bands after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Huntingtin Exon 1 Aggregation in Vitro—GST-huntingtinexon1/exp fusion protein (3 μm) was incubated at 37 °C with Precission protease (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 0.5 μm leupeptin, 0.5 μm pepstatin A for up to 7 h. Full-length CSP1-198 or mutant CSP1-82 were added with the protease cleaved fusion protein. At each time point, aliquots of each protein (500 ng) were diluted into 0.2 ml of 2% SDS, 50 mm dithiothreitol and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were then filtered through cellulose acetate membranes (0.2-μm pore size) using a Slot Blot Manifold (Amersham Biosciences). Huntingtin aggregates were detected with the MW8 anti-huntingtin antibody (21Ko J. Patterson P.H. Brain Res. Bull. 2001; 56: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).Immunoblotting—Proteins were transferred electrophoretically at constant voltage from polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose (0.45 μm or 0.2 μm) in 20 mm Tris, 150 mm glycine, 12% methanol. Transferred proteins were visualized by staining with Ponceau S. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for nonspecific binding using 5% milk, 0.1% Tween 20, PBS solution (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3) and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C or 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed three to four times in the above milk/Tween/PBS solution and incubated for 30 min with goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG-coupled horseradish peroxidase. Antigen was detected using chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactive bands were visualized following exposure of the membranes to Amersham Biosciences Hyperfilm-MP. Bound antisera were quantitated by BioRad Fluor-S MultiImager Max and QuantityOne 4.2.1 software. Differences between mean values from each group were tested using one-way analysis of variance. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05.Transient Transfection of HEK Cells and Electrophysiological Recordings—N-type calcium channel subunits and CSP (18Magga J.M. Jarvis S.E.

Huntingtin-GFP DNA constructs were obtained from (22Kazantsev A. Preisinger E. Dranovsky A. Goldgaber D. Housman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11404-11409Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) and resulted in expression of exon 1 of the huntingtin gene containing either 25, 47, or 72 glutamines followed by GFP. The sequence of all DNA constructs was confirmed. Transfection of tsA-201 cells and electrophysiological recordings were carried out as described in detail previously (Miller et al., Ref. 19Miller L.C. Swayne L.A. Kay J.G. Feng Z.P. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. Braun J.E.A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2967-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).The external recording solution was comprised of 20 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 40 mm tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA-Cl), 10 mm glucose, 65 mm CsCl, (pH 7.2 with TEA-OH), the internal pipette solution contained 108 mm CsMS, 4 mm MgCl2, 9 mm EGTA, 9 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). Series resistance was compensated by 85%, and capacitance was partially compensated. Unless stated otherwise, all error bars are S.E., and numbers in parentheses displayed in the figures reflect numbers of experiments. Statistical analysis was carried out using SigmaStat 2.0 (Jandel Scientific). Differences between mean values from each group were tested using analysis of variance followed by a Tukey post-hoc test for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05.RESULTSExon 1 of Huntingtin with an Expanded Polyglutamine Tract (huntingtinexon1/exp) Blocks the CSP Interaction with G Proteins—In order to investigate the possibility that mutant forms of huntingtin with expanded glutamine repeats alter the association of G protein with CSP, a GST fusion protein consisting of full-length CSP was coupled to glutathione-agarose beads and used in an in vitro binding assay. In each binding assay an equal amount of fusion protein was immobilized on agarose beads and confirmed by Ponceau S staining. Fusion proteins composed of GST and exon 1 of huntingtin with normal (HDQ20) and expanded (HDQ53) polyglutamine repeats were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as soluble proteins. Proteolytic cleavage of HDQ20 by PreScission protease yields soluble Myc-tagged HDQ20. Cleavage of purified GST-HDQ53 led to the formation of soluble Myc-tagged HDQ53, which after a time lag entered an aggregation phase (Fig. 2B). The aggregated HDQ53 (HDQ53*) was SDS-insoluble and did not migrate into the gel (Fig. 2B) as previously described (7Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E. Hayer-Hartl M.J. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Soluble HDQ20, soluble HDQ53 and HDQ53* were incubated with the immobilized CSP prior to the addition of rat hippocampal homogenate. The beads were washed, and the bound proteins eluted. The presence of Gα and Gβ were determined through Western blotting with anti-Gα polyclonal and anti-Gβ monoclonal, respectively. Fig. 1 shows that the association of Gβ and Gα with CSP was decreased in the presence of HDQ53. Further reduction in the G protein:CSP association was observed in the presence of HDQ53*. Neither HDQ20 nor SGT reduced the interaction between CSP and G proteins to the same extent as HDQ53. No reduction in the association of GST (background) with either Gβ or Gα was observed in the presence of HDQ53 (Fig. 1B), demonstrating the specificity of the HDQ53-induced reduction in the G protein:CSP association. These results show that huntingtinexon1/exp specifically prevents the association of CSP with Gβ and Gα.Fig. 1HDQ53 blocks CSP interactions with G proteins.A, immunoblot analysis showing the effect of cleaved HDQ53 on the interaction between CSP and Gα or Gβ. SGT (1.3 μm), HDQ20 (0.1 μm), HDQ53 (0.05 μm), and aggregated HDQ53 were preincubated with immobilized CSP (0.3 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of rat hippocampal homogenate (200 μg). Beads were washed with 200 μl of buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 4.5 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 150 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm PMSF), and bound proteins were eluted in sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis. The nitrocellulose membrane was probed with anti-Gβ monoclonal from Transduction Labs (top) and anti-Gα polyclonal from Calbiochem (bottom). The panels on the right show an experiment with a higher concentration of HDQ53 (0.2 μm). The last lane in each panel represents 30 μg of rat hippocampal homogenate loaded directly onto the gel.

C, HDQ53 (0.04 μm) was preincubated with immobilized GST (0.1 μm) and CSP (0.2 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of rat hippocampal homogenate (150 μg). Beads were washed, and bound proteins eluted in sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis.

Immobilized full-length CSP was incubated with soluble Myc-tagged HDQ20, HDQ53, and HDQ53*. The beads were washed to remove unbound protein and bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer. The presence of the huntingtin proteins was determined through Western blot analysis using anti-c-Myc monoclonal. Fig. 2A shows that HDQ53 directly bound to immobilized CSP. In contrast HDQ20 was not observed to associate with either CSP or GST. Aggregated HDQ53* was detected in pull-down assays with both GST and CSP as shown in the unresolved portion of the gel (Fig. 2A) and likely represents the insolubility of the aggregated protein rather than a specific protein interaction. Fig. 2B demonstrates that huntingtinexon1/exp aggregated in vitro after proteolytic cleavage by Prescission protease and that these aggregates did not resolve by SDS-PAGE. In contrast, Prescission protease cleavage of native huntingtinexon1/nonexp resulted in a soluble protein that is clearly resolved by SDS-PAGE. These results suggest that huntingtinexon1/exp directly and specifically associates with CSP and that this association, in turn, blocks the CSP:G protein interaction.To further evaluate the interactions between CSP, G proteins, and polyglutamine proteins, GST, GST-SGT, GST-HDQ20, and GST-HDQ53 fusion proteins were immobilized on beads and incubated with purified Gβγ proteins (Calbiochem) or rat hippocampal homogenate. In each assay, equal amounts of fusion proteins were immobilized on beads and confirmed by Coomassie (Fig. 3B) and Ponceau S staining. Fig. 3B shows the Coomassie-staining profile of purified immobilized GST-CSP, GST-HDQ20, GST-HDQ53, and GST-SGT. The beads were washed, bound proteins were eluted, and the presence of Gβ was determined through Western blotting with anti-Gβ monoclonal. No association of Gβ with GST-SGT, GST-HDQ20, and GST-HDQ53 was observed above control (GST) (Fig. 3, A and D). Also, no association above control of syntaxin, VAMP, SNAP25, or nSec1 with huntingtinexon1 fusion proteins was observed (Fig. 3, C and D). Overall, these results suggest that huntingtinexon1/exp associates with CSP but not G proteins and that the huntingtinexon1/exp:CSP interaction precludes the association of CSP with G proteins.Fig. 3Gβ does not directly interact with huntingtinexon1.A, immunoblot analysis showing that Gβ does not associate with SGT, HDQ20, or HDQ53. 250 ng of purified Gβγ (Calbiochem) or 200 μg of crude hippocampal homogenate was incubated with GST (0.6 μm), GST-SGT (0.3 μm), GST-HDQ20 (0.3 μm), and GST-HDQ53 (0.2 μm) in a final volume of 300 μl. The beads were washed, and bound proteins were eluted in sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot analysis.

We have previously shown that E. coli Hsp70 (DnaK) and Hsp40 (DnaJ) efficiently suppressed the formation of SDS-insoluble aggregates of HDQ53 (7Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E. Hayer-Hartl M.J. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). In contrast, while the human DnaJ homologue, Hdj-1, alone was unable to suppress HDQ53 aggregation, the Hdj-1:Hsc70 complex efficiently suppressed aggregation in an ATP-dependent manner (7Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E. Hayer-Hartl M.J. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Although CSP and Hsp40 both contain a J domain, outside of the J domain these proteins are unrelated. The effect of CSP on polyglutamine aggregation has not previously been reported. Fig. 4 shows that CSP does not suppress formation of SDS insoluble aggregates of HDQ53 in the filter assays at equimolar or subequimolar ratios.Fig. 4Effect of Csp1-198 and CSP1-82 on HDQ53 aggregation in vitro.

We now demonstrate, employing primary human dermal fibroblasts (CF), that the multipotent cytokine, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), can up-regulate IGF-I mRNA expression and that this regulation occurs via activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription-5b (STAT-5b) pathway. IFN-γ (100 units/ml) treatment of CF cells resulted in a preferential, time-dependent activation of STAT-5b, although both STAT-5a and STAT-5b isoforms are present. The activated STAT-5b translocated to the nucleus within 30 min of treatment and induced an increase in IGF-I mRNA of 6 ± 1.0-fold, 3 h post-treatment, with a further increase to 8 ± 1.7-fold at 5 h. In contrast, IFN-γ treatment of primary human dermal fibroblasts with a nonfunctional STAT-5b (PF cells) resulted in activation of only STAT-5a and an increase of the IGF-I mRNA level of 1.7 ± 0.6-fold, 5 h post-treatment. The IFN-γ-induced regulation of the interferon regulatory factor-1 gene, whose expression is dependent on activated STAT-1, was the same between CF and PF cells. In summary, our results provide evidence of the following in human primary dermal fibroblasts: (a) IFN-γ preferentially activates STAT-5b, but, in the absence of a functional STAT-5b, STAT-5a is activated; (b) IFN-γ time-dependently up-regulates IGF-I mRNA expression; (c) the regulation of IGF-I requires an active STAT-5b, and activated STAT-5a cannot substitute for an inactive STAT-5b; and (d) STAT-5b has an essential role in the transcriptional up-regulation of IGF-I.

Signal transduction is initiated when IFN-γ binds to a heterodimeric complex of IFN-γ receptors consisting of two IFN-γR1 and two IFN-γR2 subunits per complex. Association of JAK1 and JAK2 subsequently phosphorylates Tyr440 (in humans) on the IFN-γR1 subunits, creating docking sites for STAT-1 (4.Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D.

The recruited STAT-1, which binds through its v-src homology-2 domain, is tyrosine-phosphorylated by JAK-2, dimerizes, and translocates to the nucleus, where the activated dimer functions as a transcription factor (6.Leonard W.J.

We recently demonstrated that normal, human, primary dermal fibroblasts responded to growth hormone (GH) as well as IFN-γ (9.Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). GH treatment induced the up-regulation of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), a secreted peptide important for somatic growth (10.Woods K.A. Camacho-Hubner C. Savage M.O. Clark A.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1363-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar), and of IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) mRNA through activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathways (9.Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In particular, STAT-5b was implicated as a critical factor for the transcriptional regulation process, based on analysis of dermal fibroblasts from a patient with severe GH insensitivity resulting from an autosomal recessive mutation in the STAT-5b gene. As a consequence, the GH signaling pathway was disrupted, and IGF-I and IGFBP-3 expression was dysregulated, thereby demonstrating the importance of STAT-5b for GH-induced regulation of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 (9.Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). These results raised the question of whether other cytokines capable of activating STAT-5b can also regulate IGF-I mRNA. Limited data exist on the effects of cytokines on IGF-I expression. In murine macrophages, IFN-γ was shown to transcriptionally down-regulate IGF-I (11.Arkins S. Rebeiz N. Brunke-Reese D.L. Biragyn A. Kelley K.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 350-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) through a STAT-1-dependent mechanism (12.Wynes M.W. Riches D.W.H. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3550-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and IFN-α/β down-regulated IGF-I mRNA expression in rat glioma cells (13.Chacko M.S. Adamo M.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). More recently, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was demonstrated to similarly down-regulate IGF-I mRNA in rat myoblasts (C2C12) (14.Frost R.A. Nystrom G.J. Lang C.H. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1770-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the down-regulation was suggested to be mediated via a Jun N-terminal kinase pathway, but independent of STAT-5 phosphorylation (14.Frost R.A. Nystrom G.J. Lang C.H. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1770-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that, in contrast to the murine cell models, IFN-γ, similar to GH, up-regulates IGF-I mRNA in human dermal fibroblasts and that this up-regulation is STAT-5b-dependent. Antibodies—Antibodies directed against tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT-1 and tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT-5 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against STAT-5a (L-20), STAT-5b (G-2), STAT-1, and interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-STAT-5a/b polyclonal antibody (OPA1-03010) was from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO); and goat serum (for blocking in immunofluorescence), anti-FLAG M2 antibody, and anti-FLAG-M2-agarose gel (for immunoprecipitation) from Sigma. Secondary antibodies (anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. For immunofluorescence, Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), goat anti-mouse IgG, or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein (Molecular Probes) was used. Cell Culture—Primary fibroblast cultures, established from skin biopsies taken from a GH-insensitive patient (PF cells) and a normal 30-year-old female (CF cells), have been previously described (9.Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). PF cells were derived from a patient homozygous for a missense mutation that resulted in a Pro to Ala substitution at amino acid 630 (A630P) in the STAT-5b gene (9.Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Additional normal human dermal fibroblasts from a 31-year-old female were purchased from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD) (NHDF 8560). The fibroblasts were cultured as previously described (9.Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were from ATCC and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). For all experiments, cells were serum-starved 24 h prior to treatment with either IFN-γ (Roche Applied Science) or recombinant human GH (a generous gift from Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Immunofluorescent Analysis—Poly-d-lysine-coated, eight-chamber slides (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA) were seeded with 6000 cells/chamber. After 24 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and serum-starved overnight. Duplicate chambers were treated with IFN-γ (10 ng/ml) or GH (1 μg/ml; 500 ng/ml gave similar results) for the times indicated, and the reactions were terminated by washing with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were fixed with 100% ice-cold methanol (10 min, –20 °C) and processed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Primary antibodies employed were anti-phospho-STAT-1 (anti-pSTAT-1) (1:500 dilution) and anti-pSTAT-5 (1:500 dilution). Secondary antibodies were used at a 1:500 dilution. Hoechst (1:1000 dilution) was used for nonspecific staining of the nucleus. Immunofluorescence was observed as previously described (15.Wilson E.M. Oh Y. Hwa V. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 4504-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Plasmids—The FLAG tag was introduced into the STAT-5b cDNA sequences by PCR-amplifying ∼400 bp of the N-terminal STAT-5b cDNA using 5′-gggatggactacaaggacgacgatgacaaggctgtgtggatacaagctcagcagctccaa-3′ (forward primer; FLAG sequence is underlined) and 5′-gaccagtcgcagctcctcaaac-3′ (reverse primer). The resultant PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (TOPO TA Cloning; Invitrogen), and correct insertion of the FLAG tag was confirmed by sequencing. The 300-bp EcoRI-NcoI fragment containing the FLAG-tagged N-terminal sequence replaced the respective fragment in the nontagged STAT-5b and STAT-5b(A630P) cDNAs (in pBluescriptSK–/+; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Resultant FLAG-tagged STAT-5b (F-STAT-5b) and FLAG-tagged STAT-5b(A630P) (F-STAT-5b(A630P)) cDNAs were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Transfection Experiments—COS-7 cells were grown to ∼50% confluence in 100-mm plates. Cells were transiently transfected with vector, pcDNA3.1, or vector carrying F-STAT-5b or F-STAT-5b(A630P), using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus, Madison, WI). After a 24-h transfection, cells were washed and serum-starved (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for a further 24 h prior to treatment with IFN-γ (100 units/ml). Total RNA and cell lysates were collected 1 h post-treatment. In some cases, total cell lysates (∼320 μg) from the transfected COS-7 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG-M2-agarose gel by standard methods prior to Western immunoblot analysis. Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—RT reactions were performed with 1 μg of total RNA, oligo(dT)16 (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA), and SuperScriptII Rnase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Primers were designed for transcript amplification of IGF-I, IRF-1, and 18 S (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). For IGF-I, primers were designed to amplify a 399-bp sequence from exon 6 (3′-untranslated region) of the major IGF-I mRNA splice variant (E1a): forward, 5′-CCAACCCAGCCCTTATTATTTT-3′; reverse, 5′-CATGCCTGTAATCCCAGCAA-3′. Primers to IRF-1 generated a 550-bp sequence: forward, 5′-GCCGGACAGCACCAGTGATCTG-3′; reverse, 5′-GGCCTGCCAGGCCCTGAGA-3′. The 18 S primers resulted in a 484-bp sequence: forward, 5′-CGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA-3′; reverse, 5′-CCGGCGTCCCTCTTAATC-3′. PCR amplification was performed using Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cycling parameters were 95 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 60 s for 38 cycles (IGF-I), 30 cycles (IRF-1), or 20 cycles (18 S). For confirmation that pcDNA3.1:F-STAT-5b and pcDNA3.1:F-STAT-5b(A630P) transfected into COS-7 with equal efficiency, limiting PCR amplification of the F-STAT-5b cDNA was performed by diluting (as indicated) the RT reactions followed by PCR amplification for 22 cycles. Primers employed were, for the forward, FLAG sequence only, 5′-GGGATGGACTACAAGGACGACGAT-3′, and primer for the reverse sequence was 5′-GCAGACTCGCAGGGAACTGG-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 2070–2053 of the STAT-5b cDNA coding region). PCR products were visualized by standard agarose gel electrophoresis (16.Sambrook J. Frisch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Real Time Quantitative (RTQ)-PCR—RTQ-PCR was performed as previously described (9.Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA samples were extracted from primary fibroblast cell cultures exposed to 100 units/ml IFN-γ for the times indicated. The experiment was performed four independent times in duplicate. RTQ-PCR for each sample was done in triplicate, with 5-μl aliquots of the diluted (1:1) RT reaction. RTQ-PCR was carried out on a Prism 7700 sequence detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (Roche Applied Science). For each reaction, 15 pmol of each IGF-I forward and IGF-I reverse primer with 4 pmol of IGF1-FAM probe and 1.5 pmol of each 18 S forward and 18 S reverse primer with 1 pmol of 18 S-VIC probe were utilized. Cycling conditions were 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. The resultant data were analyzed with Sequence Detection Systems version 1.6 software (PE-ABI) and Excel 98 (Microsoft Corp., Seattle, WA). Primer sequences are as follows: IGF-I forward, 5′-TGCCCGGCTAATTTTTTGG-3′; IGF-I reverse, 5′-CATGCCTGTAATCCCAGCAA; IGF-I-6-carboxy-fluorescein-labeled (FAM), 5′-56-FAM-TTTTACCAATGTTGGCCAGGTTGGACTCA-36 tetramethyl-rhodamine-3′; 18 S forward, 5′-CGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA-3′; 18 S reverse, 5′-GGGCCTCGAAAGAGTCCTGT-3′; 18 S-VIC (Fluorochrome-labeled 18 S, ABI, Foster City, CA), 5′-VIC-CAGCAGGCGCGCAAATTACCCA-tetra-methyl-rhodamine-3′. Western Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Equal quantities of protein (Bio-Rad protein assay) were size-fractionated on reducing 7 or 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Western blots were processed with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies, following the manufacturers' protocols, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In some cases, single-comb preparative wells (Bio-Rad) were employed for protein fractionation by SDS-PAGE. A total of 250 μg of protein lysate was loaded into the single well protein gel and processed as for immunoblot analysis. The resultant membrane was marked prior to cutting of the membrane into strips for immunoblotting with the panel of anti-STAT-5 antibodies. The strips were subsequently reassembled for visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence. IFN-γ Specifically Activates STAT-5b in Normal Dermal Fibroblasts—We recently demonstrated that IFN-γ robustly activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in normal human dermal fibroblasts (CF cells), leading to phosphorylation of not only STAT-1 but also STAT-3 (9.Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The effect of IFN-γ on the STAT-5 signaling pathway in these cells, however, was not known. CF cells were therefore treated with IFN-γ (100 units/ml), and the activation of STAT-5 was examined. The activation of STAT-1 was confirmed, with pSTAT-1 readily detected within 15 min of IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 1A). STAT-5, like STAT-1 (and STAT-3; data not shown), was rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated, and phosphorylation was sustained for at least 120 min (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, compared with growth hormone-treated CF cells (9.Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), the activation of STAT-5 by IFN-γ was considerably more robust (Fig. 1C). Increasing concentrations of GH did not enhance phosphorylation of STAT-5. Although tyrosine phospho-STAT-5 was detected upon IFN-γ treatment, it was unclear initially which isoform (STAT-5a or STAT-5b) was phosphorylated. Both are present in CF cells (9.Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) and have similar molecular mass (STAT-5a, 91 kDa; STAT-5b, 84 kDa). Cell lysates were further analyzed by immunoblotting with a panel of anti-STAT-5 antibodies (Fig. 1D). As shown, STAT-5a and STAT-5b were successfully separated, and the specific isoform of STAT-5 that was phosphorylated could be determined. Under uninduced conditions, neither STAT-5a nor STAT-5b was activated (top panel). Upon IFN-γ treatment (bottom panel), it was apparent that only STAT-5b was phosphorylated (Fig. 1D). IFN-γ-induced Nuclear Localization of pSTAT-5—Activated STATs are known to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Immunofluorescent analysis of treated and untreated CF fibroblasts indicated that within 30 min of IFN-γ treatment, pSTAT-5 accumulated in the nucleus, as did pSTAT-1 (Fig. 2A). Unlike pSTAT-1, which remained nuclear for at least 90 min, depletion of nuclear pSTAT-5 was observed at 90 min. It is noted that for growth hormone-treated cells, the immunofluorescent analysis was not sufficiently sensitive to detect nuclear pSTAT-5 (Fig. 2B). The results correlated with the robust activation of STAT-5b by IFN-γ, compared with that by growth hormone. Altogether, these results suggest that in dermal fibroblasts, of the two STAT-5 isoforms, IFN-γ preferentially activates STAT-5b, which subsequently translocates to the nucleus. IFN-γ Up-regulates IGF-I mRNA Expression—Recently, we demonstrated that the transcriptional regulation of IGF-I by growth hormone in CF cells was STAT-5b-dependent (9.Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that since IFN-γ preferentially activates STAT-5b over STAT-5a, IGF-I may be a target gene for IFN-γ-activated pSTAT-5b. Preliminary analysis by semiquantitative RT-PCR amplification supported this hypothesis, with IGF-I mRNA observed to be up-regulated 3 and 5 h post-IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 3A). IRF-1, a STAT-1-dependent transcription factor known to be up-regulated by IFN-γ (17.Li X. Leung S. Qureshi S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), was up-regulated within 1 h. In contrast, expression of IGFBP-3 mRNA was not altered by IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 3A). RTQ-PCR confirmed that IGF-I mRNA was up-regulated upon IFN-γ treatment. As shown in Fig. 3B, IGF-I mRNA progressively increased in a time-dependent manner, with 6 ± 1.0-fold (S.E.) and 8 ± 1.7-fold induction 3 and 5 h post-treatment, respectively. Similar results were obtained from a second (commercially purchased) normal dermal fibroblast cell line (data not shown), demonstrating that it was not a phenomenon unique to our CF cells. In cells treated with IFN-γ for 24 or 48 h, IGF-I mRNA levels were similar to those of untreated cells (data not shown), suggesting that the up-regulation is transient. The up-regulation of IGF-I mRNA, furthermore, was not dependent on de novo protein synthesis, since the induction was not inhibited by cycloheximide treatment (data not shown). Altogether, the results demonstrate that IGF-I is a target gene of IFN-γ signal transduction and that the increase in IGF-I mRNA is likely to be the result of IFN-γ activation of STAT-5b (see below). IFN-γ Activates STAT-5a in Dermal Fibroblasts Carrying Mutant STAT-5b(A630P)—To elucidate whether IFN-γ-induced phosphorylation of STAT-5b is responsible for regulation of IGF-I mRNA, we compared the response of CF cells with that of a human primary dermal fibroblast cell line carrying a naturally occurring, nonfunctional STAT-5b (9.Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). We recently characterized these novel fibroblasts, designated PF cells, and demonstrated that they carry a homozygous missense mutation in the STAT-5b gene, which results in expression of an aberrant STAT-5b protein (schematically presented, Fig. 4A) (9.Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The mutated protein, designated STAT-5b(A630P), contains an Ala630 → Pro substitution within the v-src homology-2 domain. Unlike wild-type STAT-5b, the STAT-5b(A630P) is poorly detected by immunoblotting techniques employing STAT-5b-specific antibody (Fig. 4B, top panel) and could not be activated by the growth hormone receptor signaling pathway (9.Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The PF cells, however, had concentrations of STAT-5a comparable with that in CF cells (Fig. 4B, bottom panel). In addition, IFN-γ induced a phosphorylation pattern (STAT-1, STAT-3, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2) in PF cells identical to that observed in CF fibroblasts (9.Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The PF cells were, therefore, ideal for determining whether the up-regulation of IGF-I mRNA by IFN-γ, like growth hormone, is STAT-5b-dependent. Treatment of PF cells with IFN-γ unexpectedly resulted in a detectable phospho-STAT-5 time-dependent pattern similar to that observed in CF fibroblasts (Fig. 4C, top panel). This intriguing result suggested that either STAT-5a was now phosphorylated (unlike in CF cells) or that the mutant STAT-5b(A630P) could be activated by select cytokines such as IFN-γ but not GH (Fig. 4C, bottom panel) (9.Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of the phospho-STAT-5 product in PF cells (Fig. 4D) indicated the former hypothesis was correct (i.e. STAT-5a was preferentially phosphorylated in PF cells). Recombinant FLAG-STAT-5b(A630P) Is Not Activated by IFN-γ—To further support the observation that mutant STAT-5b(A630P) cannot be activated by IFN-γ (9.Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), the STAT-5b cDNAs, cloned from CF and PF cells (9.Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), were N-terminally FLAG-tagged for expression in the COS-7 cell system. COS-7 cells have undetectable STAT-5b, and our initial characterization of COS-7 cells indicated that IFN-γ, but not growth hormone, induced the JAK/STAT signaling cascade (9.Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) (data not shown), confirming the presence of sufficient functional endogenous IFN-γ receptors but not growth hormone receptors. COS-7 cells were transfected with vector (pcDNA3.1) or vector carrying either wild-type FLAG-STAT-5b or FLAG-STAT-5b(A630P) and treated with IFN-γ. The efficiency of transfection and mRNA expression was equivalent, as determined by limiting RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5B (lanes 1 and 2), IFN-γ induced phosphorylation of endogenous STAT-5a in nontransfected cells. An equivalent pSTAT-5 pattern was detected in COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 4). Overexpression of wild-type FLAG-STAT-5b resulted in low, basal, constitutive phosphorylation of the recombinant STAT-5b (Fig. 5B, lane 5). Treatment with IFN-γ (1 h) significantly increased detectable phospho-FLAG-STAT-5b (Fig. 5B, lane 6). In contrast, cells transfected with FLAG-STAT-5b(A630P) cDNA generated a phospho-STAT-5 pattern (Fig. 5B, lanes 7 and 8) similar to untransfected and vector-transfected cells. Interestingly, the recombinant human FLAG-STAT-5b proteins (both wild-type and mutant) were readily distinguishable from endogenous STAT-5a, since the recombinant proteins ran at a higher molecular weight on SDS-PAGE than does the endogenous protein. Immunoblotting with anti-STAT-5a indicated that total protein loading was the same and that endogenous STAT-5a was unaffected by the transfection process. Sequential stripping and reprobing of the pSTAT-5 blot with anti-FLAG antibody and anti-STAT-5b-specific antibody (Fig. 5B) indicated that the mutant STAT-5b protein was consistently less well immunodetected than wild-type (an ∼4-fold difference in detection). This difference in detection may account for the inability to detect phospho-FLAG-STAT-5b(A630P). Therefore, increased loading of cell lysate"
https://openalex.org/W2121747833,"Adenosine is an autacoid that regulates renal Na+ transport. Activation of adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) by N6-cyclopentidyladenosine (CPA) inhibits the Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) via phospholipase C/Ca2+/protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway. Mutation of PKC phosphorylation sites on NHE3 does not affected regulation of NHE3 by CPA, but amino acid residues 462 and 552 are essential for A1R-dependent control of NHE3 activity. One binding partner of the NHE family is calcineurin homologous protein (CHP). We tested the role of NHE3-CHP interaction in mediating CPA-induced inhibition of NHE3 in opossum kidney (OK) and Xenopus laevis uroepithelial (A6) cells. Both native and transfected NHE3 and CHP are present in the same immuno-complex by co-immunoprecipitation. CPA (10-6 M) increases CHP-NHE3 interaction by 30 - 60% (native and transfected proteins). Direct CHP-NHE3 interaction is evident by yeast two-hybrid assay (bait, NHE3C terminus; prey, CHP); the minimal interacting region is localized to the juxtamembrane region of NHE3C terminus (amino acids 462-552 of opossum NHE3). The yeast data were confirmed in OK cells where truncated NHE3 (NHE3Δ552) still shows CPA-stimulated CHP interaction. Overexpression of the polypeptide from the CHP binding region (NHE3462-552) interferes with the ability of CPA to inhibit NHE3 activity and to increase CHPNHE3Full-length interaction. Reduction of native CHP expression by small interference RNA abolishes the ability of CPA to inhibit NHE3 activity. We conclude that CHPNHE3 interaction is regulated by A1R activation and this interaction is a necessary and integral part of the signaling pathway between adenosine and NHE3. Adenosine is an autacoid that regulates renal Na+ transport. Activation of adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) by N6-cyclopentidyladenosine (CPA) inhibits the Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) via phospholipase C/Ca2+/protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway. Mutation of PKC phosphorylation sites on NHE3 does not affected regulation of NHE3 by CPA, but amino acid residues 462 and 552 are essential for A1R-dependent control of NHE3 activity. One binding partner of the NHE family is calcineurin homologous protein (CHP). We tested the role of NHE3-CHP interaction in mediating CPA-induced inhibition of NHE3 in opossum kidney (OK) and Xenopus laevis uroepithelial (A6) cells. Both native and transfected NHE3 and CHP are present in the same immuno-complex by co-immunoprecipitation. CPA (10-6 M) increases CHP-NHE3 interaction by 30 - 60% (native and transfected proteins). Direct CHP-NHE3 interaction is evident by yeast two-hybrid assay (bait, NHE3C terminus; prey, CHP); the minimal interacting region is localized to the juxtamembrane region of NHE3C terminus (amino acids 462-552 of opossum NHE3). The yeast data were confirmed in OK cells where truncated NHE3 (NHE3Δ552) still shows CPA-stimulated CHP interaction. Overexpression of the polypeptide from the CHP binding region (NHE3462-552) interferes with the ability of CPA to inhibit NHE3 activity and to increase CHPNHE3Full-length interaction. Reduction of native CHP expression by small interference RNA abolishes the ability of CPA to inhibit NHE3 activity. We conclude that CHPNHE3 interaction is regulated by A1R activation and this interaction is a necessary and integral part of the signaling pathway between adenosine and NHE3. Adenosine is an ubiquitous nucleoside generated from AMP by 5′-nucleotidase or from S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) 1The abbreviations used are: SAH, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; NHE3, Na+/H+ exchanger 3; A1R, adenosine A1 receptor; A2R, adenosine A2 receptor; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; CHP, calcineurin homologous protein; OK, opossum kidney cells; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; aa, amino acid(s); CMV, cytomegalovirus; TMA, tetramethylammonium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interference RNA.1The abbreviations used are: SAH, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; NHE3, Na+/H+ exchanger 3; A1R, adenosine A1 receptor; A2R, adenosine A2 receptor; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; CHP, calcineurin homologous protein; OK, opossum kidney cells; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; aa, amino acid(s); CMV, cytomegalovirus; TMA, tetramethylammonium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interference RNA. by SAH hydrolase (1.Poulsen S.A.

Renal adenosine is derived exogenously from the systemic circulation through mainly neuro-muscular sources or endogenously via the intrarenal AMP and SAH pathways (2.Jackson E.K. Dubey R.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F597-F612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adenosine modulates many functions in mammals via binding to A1, A2A, A2B, and/or A3 adenosine receptors (1.Poulsen S.A. Quinn R.J.

In the kidney, adenosine regulates glomerular filtration rate, renin release, erythropoietin production, cellular proliferation, and tubular water and Na+ transport (2.Jackson E.K. Dubey R.K. Am. J.

Renal adenosine generation is markedly increased in response to hypoxia, ischemia, or inflammation (2.Jackson E.K. Dubey R.K. Am. J.

It is well documented that adenosine can exert its protective effect against acute renal ischemia by containing inflammatory damage inflicted by circulating immune cells (2.Jackson E.K. Dubey R.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F597-F612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Okusa M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F10-F18PubMed Google Scholar). A concomitant protective effect during ischemia can be achieved by reducing oxygen expenditure of the renal tubules through inhibition of Na+ transport, the principal oxygen-consuming process (5.Kiil F.

In the renal proximal tubules, which constitute over 70% of renal cortical mass, adenosine decreases the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 on the apical membrane of the proximal tubule (7.Di Sole F.

The inhibition of apical Na+ entry decreases the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase and oxygen requirement of the highly aerobic proximal tubule (10.Blond D.M. Whittam R. Biochem.

All NHEs have a predicted N-terminal hydrophobic ion-translocating domain and a variable C-terminal hydrophilic domain that harbors regulatory sequences (15.Numata M. Petrecca K. Lake N. Orlowski J.

NHE3 is the isoform in the apical membrane based on antigenic (19.Amemiya M. Loffing J. Lotscher M. Kaissling B. Alpern R.J. Moe O.W.

Vanden Heuvel G. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F467-F473Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), but definitive data are still forthcoming. The current study focuses on NHE3. Using a heterologous system, we found that acute A1R and A2R stimulation inhibits NHE3 via primarily PKC-coupled and PKA-coupled pathways, respectively (7.Di Sole F. Casavola V. Mastroberardino L. Verrey F. Moe O.W. Burckhardt G. Murer H. Helmle-Kolb C. J. Physiol. 1999; 515: 829-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In a recent report (8.Di Sole F. Cerull R. Casavola V. Moe O.W. Burckhardt G. Helmle-Kolb C. J. Physiol. 2002; 541: 529-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we showed that early A2R activation is associated with a change in intrinsic transport activity of NHE3, whereas sustained inhibition of NHE3 was accompanied by a reduction of surface NHE3 protein. In addition, we showed that regulation of NHE3 activity by A2R activation is dependent on phosphorylation of NHE3 at two primary PKA target sites (8.Di Sole F. Cerull R. Casavola V. Moe O.W. Burckhardt G. Helmle-Kolb C. J. Physiol. 2002; 541: 529-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although there are some parallels between PKA- and PKC-dependent control of NHE3 activity, it is not known whether phosphorylation supports the A1R ability to regulate NHE3. Recently, we presented evidence that inactivation of NHE3 activity in response to A1R stimulation depends on elevation of intracellular Ca2+ (9.Di Sole F. Cerull R. Petzke S. Casavola V. Burckhardt G. Helmle-Kolb C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 1720-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Calcineurin homologous protein (CHP) is a recently described widely expressed Ca2+-binding EF-hand protein of ∼22 kDa (25.Barroso M.R. Bernd K.K. DeWitt N.D. Chang A. Mills K. Sztul E.S. J. Biol.

Nakamura N. Kanazawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). CHP attenuates the stimulation of NHE1 by serum and a mutationally activated GTPase in CCL39 cells (26.Lin X. Barber D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12631-12636Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In PS120 fibroblasts, CHP binding to NHE1 does not affect surface NHE1 abundance but was necessary for surface NHE1 to function (28.Pang T. Su X. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17367-17372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The ability of CHP to alter NHE1 transport independent of surface NHE1 protein (28.Pang T. Su X. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17367-17372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) renders it an attractive candidate for supporting adenosine-mediated change in intrinsic transport activity of NHE3. CHP associates with microtubules via an N-myristoylation-dependent mechanism that does not involve conventional microtubule-associated proteins (30.Timm S. Titus B. Bernd K. Barroso M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3473-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and is involved in vesicular transport (25.Barroso M.R. Bernd K.K. DeWitt N.D. Chang A. Mills K. Sztul E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10183-10187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). CHP also interacts with kinesin-related protein KIF1Bβ2, a molecular motor in neurons (31.Nakamura N. Miyake Y. Matsushita M. Tanaka S. Inoue H. Kanazawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These properties of CHP make it a plausible mediator in changes in trafficking between surface and intracellular NHE3 proteins. Although CHP clearly binds NHE3 (28.Pang T. Su X. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17367-17372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the functional effect of CHP-NHE3 interaction has not been studied in the context of hormonal regulation of Na+ and H+ transport. In this manuscript, we described the role of CHP in mediating the regulation of NHE3 by adenosine. Cell Culture and Transfection—Experiments were performed on OK and A6/C1 cells. A subclone of OK cells selected on the basis of expression of parathyroid hormone-sensitive Na+/phosphate co-transport (32.Helmle-Kolb C. Montrose M.H. Stange G. Murer H. Pflugers Arch. 1990; 415: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was cultured in a mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium Ham's F-12 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 IU ml-1 penicillin and 50 μg ml-1 streptomycin in a humidified 95%/5% air/CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C and sub-cultured weekly. Cells generally reached confluence within 3-4 days, and experiments were conducted 1-2 days after confluence. Studies on OK cells were performed between passages 23 and 57. A6/C1 cells are a subclone of A6-2F3 cells, functionally selected on the basis of high transepithelial resistance and responsiveness to aldosterone (33.Verrey F. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 138: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These cells express endogenous basolateral Na+/H+ exchange activity (7.Di Sole F. Casavola V. Mastroberardino L. Verrey F. Moe O.W.

Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 516-523PubMed Google Scholar) and transfected NHE3 is targeted to the apical membrane (7.Di Sole F. Casavola V. Mastroberardino L. Verrey F. Moe O.W. Burckhardt G. Murer H.

Physiol. 2002; 541: 529-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A6/C1 cell lines were grown in 0.8× concentrated Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 25 mm NaHCO3, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 IU ml-1 penicillin and 50 μg ml-1 streptomycin in a humidified 95%/5% air/CO2 atmosphere at 28 °C. For A6 cells transfected with NHE3, medium was supplemented with 450 μg ml-1 hygromycin B. Cells were subcultured weekly by trypsinization (Ca2+/Mg2+-free salt solution containing 0.25% (w/v) trypsin and 2 mm EGTA). Cells generally reached confluence between 7 and 8 days after seeding, and studies were performed between passages 6 and 43. For transient transfection, cells were grown to ∼70% confluence in culture dishes, and 1.3 μg of cDNA was introduced into cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Transfection efficiency was monitored by co-transfection of the pEGFP plasmid (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and was approximately 70%. For stable transfection, A6 cells were grown to 20-25% confluence in 35-mm tissue culture dishes, and cDNA was introduced into cells using FuGENE 6™ (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). The construct of interest (1.5 μg) was co-transfected with the p3′SSΔLacI vector (0.5 μg) to allow selection by hygromycin B resistance (7.Di Sole F. Casavola V. Mastroberardino L. Verrey F. Moe O.W. Burckhardt G. Murer H. Helmle-Kolb C. J. Physiol. 1999; 515: 829-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Clonal populations of transfected cell lines obtained by ring cloning were maintained in hygromycin. Hygromycin-resistant clones were further selected for NHE3 transcripts by reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown) as previously described (8.Di Sole F. Cerull R. Casavola V. Moe O.W. Burckhardt G. Helmle-Kolb C. J. Physiol. 2002; 541: 529-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cells used for experiments were treated for 6-7 days with 1 μm dexamethasone known to accelerate maturation and differentiation (35.Preston A.S. Muller J. Handler J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C661-C666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure true segregation of the apical and basolateral surface, we established that A6/C1 cell lines exhibited reproducible high transepithelial resistances. Untransfected A6/C1 cells transepithelial resistance was comparable with NHE3-transfected ones (data not shown). Plasmid Constructs—Generation of constructs encoding for wild-type and mutated forms of rat-NHE3 (at either a single endogenous serine position or at six endogenous serine positions on the cytoplasmic tail of NHE3) has been previously described (8.Di Sole F. Cerull R. Casavola V. Moe O.W. Burckhardt G. Helmle-Kolb C. J. Physiol. 2002; 541: 529-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 36.Zhao H. Wiederkehr M.R. Fan L. Collazo R.L. Crowder L.A.

Physiol. 1999; 276: C1205-C1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length and truncated forms of NHE3 cDNAs were generated by high fidelity PCR using forward and reverse primers flanked with the appropriate restriction endonuclease sites and sub-cloned into the desired plasmids. All constructs were verified by direct sequencing. Mammalian expression plasmids and inserts included: 1) C-terminal c-Myc and hexahistidine (His6)-tagged rat and opossum NHE3 (NHE3/myc/6H) (pcDNA3.1, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA); 2) C-terminal human influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged mouse-CHP (CHP/HA) (pMH™, Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN); 3) C-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-tagged OK-NHE3 (NHE3/eGFP) (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA); and 4) N-terminal FLAG-tagged OK-NHE3 sequence comprising aa 462-552 (FLAG/NHE3462-552) (pFLAG-CMV™-2; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). For yeast two-hybrid bait construction, the C terminus of mouse NHE3 was cloned from mouse kidney poly-A+ RNA using primers derived from rat NHE3 (forward 5′-gccgaattctttcagggcctgaccattaagcc-3′; reverse 5′-cggttgacatcacatgtgtgtggactcagg-3′) using low stringency PCR. After sequence verification, EcoRI and SalI restriction sites were introduced by PCR into cDNA fragments polymerized from wild-type mouse NHE3 (mNHE3c terminus) as template. Bait constructs (NHE3382-839 (aa 382-839), NHE3382-794 (aa 382-794), NHE3382-557 (aa 382-557), NHE3382-501 (aa 382-501), NHE3766-839 (aa 766-839), and NHE3794-839 (aa 794-839)) were made as in-frame fusion proteins with the LexA DNA binding domain in the vector pBTM116 carrying the TRP1 selection marker (38.Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar) (Clontech). Measurement of Na+/H+ Exchange Activity—NHE activity was measured as the rate of Na+-dependent recovery of cytosolic pH (pHi) following an acid load (NH4Cl prepulse) as described previously (8.Di Sole F. Cerull R. Casavola V. Moe O.W. Burckhardt G. Helmle-Kolb C. J. Physiol. 2002; 541: 529-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Confluent cells on permeable support (collagen-coated coverslip with a 1.5-mm central perforation covered by a Millicell-CM 0.4-μm Teflon filter (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) were dye-loaded (4.2 μm 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and -6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester; 50 μm probenecid) in Na+-containing medium (60 min) and superfused continuously with Na+ medium on the stage of an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 100). After recording baseline pHi, cells were acid-loaded (Na+ medium + 40 mm NH4Cl, followed by Na+-free medium) and subsequent addition of Na+ medium yielded NHE activity as the rate of pHi recovery. In A6 transfectants, addition of Na+ medium to either the apical or basolateral cell surface allowed independent polarized measurement of NHE activity. Media used in pH measurements were nominally bicarbonate-free. For OK cells: isotonic Na+ medium contained (in mm): 130 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgSO4, 1 NaH2PO4, 18 glucose, and 20 HEPES buffered to pH 7.4 with NaOH; isotonic TMA+ medium composed of (in mm): 130 tetramethylammonium chloride (TMACl), 4 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgSO4, 1 TMAH2PO4, 18 glucose, and 20 HEPES, pH 7.4, with TMAOH. For A6 cells: isotonic Na+ medium contained (in mm): 110 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 0.5 MgSO4, 1 KH2PO4, 5 glucose, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.5, with Tris; isotonic TMA+ medium contained (in mm): 110 TMACl, 3 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 0.5 MgSO4, 1 KH2PO4, 5 glucose, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.5, with Tris. The microfluorometry was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 100 inverted microscope with a Zeiss LD “Achroplan” 63×/0.75 objective, coupled to a multiwavelength illumination system (Polychrome II from T.I.L.L. Photonics GmbH, Gräfelfing, Germany). A monochromatizing device with an integral light source (75-watt xenon arc lamp) alternatively selected the excitation wavelengths (495 ± 10 and 440 ± 10 nm) via a galvanometric scanner and directed to the cells via a 515-nm dichroic mirror and a 535 ± 25-nm band-pass collected filter fluorescence emission. Photometric data were acquired using the MetaFlour software (Visitron Systems, Puchheim, Germany). Calibration of the fluorescence signals to pHi cells was performed in the presence of the K+/H+ ionophore nigericin (0.5 μm) in isotonic K+-rich medium as described previously (39.Krayer-Pawlowska D. Helmle-Kolb C. Montrose M.H. Krapf R. Murer H. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 120: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For A6 cells the isotonic K+-rich medium used contained (in mm): 105 KCl, 8 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 0.5 MgSO4, 1 KH2PO4, 5 glucose, and 10 HEPES buffered to various pH values for calibration of intracellular BCECF. Quantification of Surface NHE3 Antigen—The assay was performed as described previously (40.Hu M.C. Fan L. Crowder L.A. Karim-Jimenez Z. Murer H. Moe O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26906-26915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). OK cells were grown to confluence on 100-mm culture dishes, whereas A6 cells stably expressing wild-type OK-NHE3 were grown on 40-cm2 collagen-coated Nucleopore Polycarbonate Track-Etch membranes (Fischer Scientific, Hampton, NH). The latter configuration allowed polarized quantification of NHE3 expression in the apical versus basolateral membranes. After exposure to agonists or vehicle, cells were rinsed in Ca/Mg/PBS (in mm: 150 NaCl, 10 Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, 0.1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2), incubated with the arginineand lysine-reactive NHS-SS-biotin (2 mg ml-1, Pierce, Rockford, IL) in buffer (in mm: 150 NaCl, 10 triethanolamine, pH 7.4, 2 CaCl2) for 1 h. After quenching in Ca/Mg/PBS supplemented with 100 mm glycine, cells were lysed in biotin-RIPA buffer (in mm: 150 NaCl, 50 Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS) and centrifuged (109,000 × g at rmax, 50,000 rpm, 25 min, 4 °C, Beckman TLX ultracentrifuge, TLA 100.3 rotor, Beckman, Fullerton, CA), and the protein content in the supernatant was quantified by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Equal protein amounts of cell lysate were equilibrated with streptavidin-agarose beads at 4 °C, washed sequentially with solution A (in mm: 50 Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 NaCl, 5 EDTA), solution B (in mm: 50 Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 NaCl), and solution C (in mm: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Biotinylated proteins were released by incubation in 100 mm dithiothreitol, reconstituted in Laemmli buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-OK-NHE3 antisera (#5683) (40.Hu M.C.

The integrity of the monolayer was confirmed by measurement of trans-epithelial resistance prior to the experiment and again following surface labeling with NHS-SS-biotin.

For transformation, a YPDA culture from L40 (20 ml) grown to an A600 of ∼1 (18 h) was centrifuged at 1,200 × g for 3 min, washed with 40 ml of distilled H2O, and resuspended in 1 ml of distilled H2O. Aliquots of 50 μl of competent yeast were treated with 240 μl of polyethylene glycol (50% w/v), 36 μl of 1 m LiAc, 25 μl of single-stranded DNA (2.0 mg/ml), 50 μl of distilled H2O, and 1 μg of the plasmid of interest, according to Gietz and Schiestl (43.Gietz R.D.

Protein kinases are important drug targets for oncologic, immunologic, and metabolic disorders. The development of selective protein kinase inhibitors is widely considered a promising approach to drug development.

(January 16, 2001) U. S. Patent 6,174,993Google Scholar) approach presented in this article is based upon deriving short peptides from specific regions in the catalytic domain of the kinase that are implicated in kinase-substrate interactions. The KinAce™ peptides mimic regions of the kinase and therefore compete with the kinase for binding to the substrate (or to other modulators of the kinase), and subsequently abrogate the kinase-dependent signaling. Several other groups have used peptides to disrupt protein-protein interactions and thus modulate kinase signaling. In contrast to our technology, which derives the peptides from the catalytic domain of the kinase, others have derived inhibitory peptides from the substrates (7.Ramdas L. Obeyesekere N.U. Sun G.

This paper summarizes data that point to the pivotal role of the KinAce™ regions of various kinases, in substrate binding. The sequence and structural characteristics of these regions are analyzed utilizing published three-dimensional structures of kinase-substrate complexes and mutational studies, as well as accessibility and variability of residues in these regions. We derive myristoylated peptides based on the KinAce™ regions of selected kinases and show that they selectively inhibit kinase-dependent phosphorylation in cellular or cell-free assays. We further show the inhibitory effects of these peptides on proliferation of cancer cells. We thus demonstrate the applicability of the KinAce™ approach for systematic derivation of selective kinase inhibitors, and the possibility of using the resulting peptides as lead compounds for optimization into potential drugs. Finally, we describe the KinScreen application, which enables identification of novel links between kinases and therapeutical indications. Specifically, we exemplify how a known kinase, Lyn, was identified as a novel target for the treatment of solid tumors. Peptides—Peptides (purity >85%) were synthesized by Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis and purified by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography, by Novetide Ltd. (Haifa, Israel) or Genemed Synthesis Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Identity and purity were confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy. Me2SO based formulations used were the following. Me2SO, the peptide was dissolved in 100% Me2SO at 10 mm concentration. Me2SOt, the peptide was dissolved in 100% Me2SO at 10 mm concentration and heated at 100 °C for 30 min, and for DMSOtbi, 40 μl of 10 mm peptide dissolved in Me2SO were added to 160 μl of 2 m ammonium bicarbonate solution and heated at 100 °C for 40 min until no evaporation was detected. For the cell proliferation assay peptides were further diluted in 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) 1The abbreviations used are: BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Abs, antibodies; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PKB, protein kinase B; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; SCF, stem cell factor; ERK, extracellular regulated kinase; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; PKA, protein kinae A; JNK, N-terminal c-Jun kinase; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; IRK, insulin receptor kinase; ILK, integrin-linked kinase; Alk-1, activin receptor-like kinase 1; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. in PBS, pH 7.4 (BSA-PBS). Cell Culture and Cell Proliferation Assay—All cell lines are of human origin. Hormone refractory prostate cancer cell lines DU-145 and PC-3, mammary gland breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, and epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29 and human NCI-H526 small cell lung carcinoma cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780 was purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures. Cells were grown and treated in RPMI 1640 (standard or Dutch modification) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (all reagents for cell culture were purchased from Biological Industries Bet-Haemek Ltd., Israel). For the cell proliferation assay 3.6–7.2 × 103 cells/well were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates (180 μl/well). The inhibitors were added 3 h later to allow cell adhesion to the plates. The peptides were prepared as stock solutions in Me2SO-based formulations as described above (except for KRX-014H151 that was prepared in AMI159 formulation as detailed below). The stock solution was diluted to 100 μm in PBS containing 0.1% BSA and further 1:1 dilutions were made while retaining a constant vehicle concentration. Aliquots (20 μl) were dispersed in triplicates into the cell-containing wells, either of peptide dilutions, vehicle, or non-treated (BSA-PBS). Plates are incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator for 3–4 days, fixed in 4% buffered formaldehyde solution for 2 h, washed with 0.1 m sodium borate buffer, pH 8.5, and stained with 1% methylene blue dissolved in 0.1 m borate buffer solution for 10 min. Excess dye was washed out and cell-bound dye was eluted with 200 μl/well of 0.1 m HCl. The optical density value was read at 595 nm in the Labsystems Multiscan RC enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. The data was analyzed in Microsoft Excel, using the vehicle control as 100% proliferation. The vehicle had no significant effect on cell proliferation. Immunoblotting—Samples of cell-free kinase assays or aliquots of cell extracts containing equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose filters. Membranes were blocked with blocking solution containing either 5% low fat milk or 3% BSA in TBST (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20), incubated with primary antibodies (Abs) overnight at 4 °C, and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or donkey anti-mouse secondary Abs (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Pierce), and quantified using ImageJ software version 1.26t. Cloning and Expression of GST-Syk—The entire Syk open reading frame was generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR (accession number L28824) and cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion of Syk. The plasmid was verified by sequencing. Expression of GST-Syk in Escherichia coli BL21 Lys was induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at an A600 of 0.6, and allowed to grow at 26 °C for 6 h. Bacterial cells were sonicated in PBS supplemented with 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and bacterial protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) on ice, prior to centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. Soluble GST-Syk was purified with GSTrap™FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using an AKTAdesign (Amersham Biosciences). GST-Syk eluted with 40 mm glutathione yielding 90% pure protein. Protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm. Lyn-Syk Cell-free Kinase Assay—Each reaction contained a peptide of interest dissolved in 1% Me2SO at a concentration indicated in the figure, 98 ng of GST-Syk and 27 ng of active His-tagged recombinant human Lyn (Panvera) in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The mixtures were agitated at 900 rpm for 20 min at 30 °C, and reactions were initiated by the addition of 100 μm ATP, and maintained for 10 min under the same conditions. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer, separated on SDS-PAGE, and probed with antiphosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P), 4G10, Upstate) monoclonal antibodies (mAb) followed by reprobing with anti-Syk polyclonal Abs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cloning and Expression of Lyn—The entire Lyn open reading frame was generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR (accession number M16038), and cloned into pET-21b (Novagen). Kinase-dead Lyn was prepared by the mutation of lysine to leucine at position 275 (designated Lyn-K275L). In vitro mutagenesis was performed using GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). Plasmid constructs were verified by sequencing. Expression of Lyn-K275L in E. coli BL21 Lys was induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.6, and allowed to grow at 26 °C for 4 h. The bacteria were lysed as described for GST-Syk. Lyn-K275L was expressed as inclusion bodies, which were dissolved in 20 mm Tris, pH 10.3, containing 3 m urea for 1 h at room temperature. The denatured soup was centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm and the supernatant was subjected to three dialysis steps at 4 °C: against 20 mm Tris, pH 9.0 and 8.5, each containing 5% glycerol and 100 mm NaCl, and finally against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The refolded protein was centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm yielding 95% pure protein with no further purification steps. Protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm. Lyn Cell-free Transphosphorylation Assay—Each reaction contained a peptide of interest dissolved in 1% Me2SO at the concentration indicated in the figure, 720 ng of Lyn-K275L, 13.5 ng of active His-tagged recombinant human Lyn (Panvera) in reaction buffer. The mixtures were treated as described for the Lyn-Syk assay, but maintained for 15 min following addition of ATP. Western blots were probed with anti-Tyr(P) mAb, followed by reprobing with anti-Lyn Abs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Src Cell-free Transphosphorylation Assay—Each reaction contained peptides dissolved in 1% Me2SO and 220 ng of Src (Biomol Research Laboratories) in reaction buffer. The mixtures were agitated at 800 rpm for 20 min at 30 °C, reactions were initiated by the addition of 100 μm ATP, and agitation was maintained for 10 min. Reactions were terminated by SDS sample buffer and samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-Tyr(P) mAb, followed by reprobing with anti-Src Abs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). PKB-GSK3 Cell-free Kinase Assay—DU-145 cells were serum-starved overnight and lysed at 4 °C in mild lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm NaPPi, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture (Aldrich-Sigma)). Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation of glycogen synthetase kinase 3 (GSK3) by 2 μg/sample anti-GSK3 Ab (Transduction Laboratories) and 15 μl/sample immobilized protein G (Pierce) at 4 °C for 4 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with cold mild lysis buffer and twice with cold reaction buffer II (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Reaction buffer containing 120 ng/sample recombinant active Akt1/PKBα (Upstate Biotechnology) and either peptides at the indicated concentrations or vehicle (0.1% Me2SO and 0.9% ethanol in DDW) were added. Samples were rotated 1400 rpm at 30 °C for 20 min, prior to the addition of ATP to a final concentration of 100 μm for an additional 5-min incubation. Reactions were terminated by SDS sample buffer and samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-phospho-GSK3 Ab (Cell Signaling Technology) followed by anti-GSK3 Ab (Transduction Laboratories). Transphosphorylation of c-Kit and NCI-H526 Cell Proliferation— NCI-H526 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. When grown in serum-free media, 0.1% BSA was added. For analysis of c-Kit transphosphorylation, cells were starved in serum-free medium for 12 h and inhibitory or control peptides at the indicated concentrations, or vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) were added for 1 h. 50 ng/ml human recombinant stem cell factor (SCF, Calbiochem) was added for the last 10 min of incubation. Cells were lysed on ice in lysis buffer B containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture. The lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 rpm, and the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and probed with either polyclonal anti-phospho-c-Kit Ab (Cell Signaling Technology) or anti-actin Ab (Sigma) as a marker for total protein. For NCI-H526 cell proliferation assay, 96-well plates containing eight replicates per assay condition were seeded at a density of 1 × 104 cells in 0.1 ml of serum-free media, and 16 h later the cells were stimulated with SCF (100 ng/ml), and incubation was continued for 72 h. Peptides or vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) were added 30 min before the addition of SCF. Cell growth was measured using the XTT (Biological Industries Bet-Haemek Ltd., Israel) colorimetric dye reduction method. Growth was calculated by subtracting the absorbance at 450 nm of the non-stimulated cells from all systems. The growth of the SCF-stimulated cells was defined as 100% growth, and other systems were expressed relative to it. Cytosolic FKHR Levels and ERK Phosphorylation in Breast Cancer Cells Treated with PKB-derived Peptide—Breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells were serum starved and incubated with vehicle (AMI159 formulation, see below), 20 μm phosphatidylinositol 3′-OH kinase inhibitor LY294002 (Calbiochem), PKB-derived peptide KRX-014H151 in AMI159 formulation, or a control peptide derived from Lyn for 18 h. Cells were subsequently stimulated with 50 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) for 10 min, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in lysis buffer B1 (lysis buffer B containing 1% Triton X-100). Lysates were probed with antibodies against forkhead (Cell Signaling Technology), GSK3 (Transduction Laboratories), phosphorylated-ERK (Sigma), and ERK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For AMI159 formulation, peptide (10 mg) was dissolved in 0.4 ml of 0.2% acetic acid and 5% mannitol in TDW and agitated by vortex. 0.15 ml of PG solution (4% benzyl alcohol, 4% pluronic L44, and 2% benzyl benzoate in propylene glycol) was added and vortexed. The solution was heated at 100 °C for 15 min, and neutralized by gradual addition of 0.15 ml of 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and 0.3 ml of 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The solution was spun in a Polytron at 20,000 rpm for 2 min, heated to 100 °C for 15 min, spun again in a Polytron at 20,000 rpm for 2 min, and heated to 100 °C for 30 min. p27Kip1 Levels in Breast Cancer Cells Treated with PKB-derived Peptide—MDA-MB-231 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum were incubated with vehicle (AK19 formulation, see below), KRX-014H151, or a control peptide at the indicated concentrations for 18 h. Cells were detached using 15 mm EDTA in PBS and resuspended in hypoosmotic buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture. Following centrifugation supernatants were resolved on SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-p27Kip1 mAb (Transduction Laboratories) and polyclonal anti-actin Ab (Sigma). AK19 formulation was 5 mg/ml peptide in 0.2% acetic acid, 1% pluronic L44, and 5% mannitol neutralized with 0.3 m sodium bicarbonate. PKB Phosphorylation in Prostate Cancer Cells Treated with PDK1-derived Peptide—Prostate cancer DU-145 cells were serum-starved for 14 h and exposed to vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) or peptides at the indicated concentrations for the last 4 h of starvation. Cells were stimulated with IGF-1 (50 ng/ml) for 10 min and lysed with lysis buffer B1. Equal amounts of protein were separated on SDS-PAGE, and probed with anti-phospho-PKB(T308), anti-phospho-PKB(S473), both from Cell Signaling, and anti-GSK3 Abs. Aortic Ring Assay—All animal procedures were approved by the animal care and use committee of the Hebrew University. As previously reported (26.Nicosia R.F. Ottinetti A. Lab. Invest. 1990; 63: 115-122PubMed Google Scholar), thoracic aortas were dissected from 8–10-week-old male BALB/c mice. The aortas were immediately transferred to Petri dishes containing BIO-MPM-1 (Biological Industries Ltd., Israel). The adventitia and small vessels around the aorta were carefully removed under a dissecting microscope, and transverse cuts of 0.5 mm were made. The resulting aortic rings were extensively rinsed and incubated overnight in BIO-MPM-1 containing penicillin-streptomycin. Subsequently, the rings were embedded in 600–800 μl of a collagen mixture (7 parts rat tail collagen (27.Strom S.C. Michalopoulos G. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 544-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), 1 part ×10 minimal essential medium (biological industries), and 2 parts 0.15 m sodium bicarbonate) in 24-well plates. Raising the pH to neutral and the temperature to 37 °C achieved solidification of the collagen solution. In each well, 3 aortic rings were embedded. Medium (400 μl of Endo-SFM (Invitrogen) containing penicillin-streptomycin and 30 ng/ml SCF with 10 μm peptide or vehicle were added to the embedded rings, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 10% CO2 atmosphere. Medium containing SCF and either peptides or vehicle was replaced 3 times a week. After 7 days, the rings were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 24 h, followed by staining with crystal violet (0.02%) dissolved in ethanol, and extensive washing to remove excessive stain. The effect of SCF and peptides was examined in 3 wells (9 rings) per peptide. Micrographs of representative rings were taken using a digital camera (Nikon, Japan). Morphometric analysis of sprouting was performed manually using Image-Pro 4.5 software (MediaCybernetics) according to Nissanov et al. (28.Nissanov J. Tuman R.W. Gruver L.M. Fortunato J.M. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 734-739PubMed Google Scholar). KinAce™ Regions: Definition, Patterns, and Analysis of Three-dimensional Structures and Mutational Data—The KinAceTM platform targets well defined regions, consisting of subdomain V (the αD region), the loop between subdomains IX and X (named the HJ loop (24.Goldenberg-Furmanov, M., Stein, I., Pikarsky, E., Rubin, H., Kasem, S., Wygoda, M., Weinstein, I., Reuveni, H., and Ben-Sasson, S. A. (2003) Cancer Res., in pressGoogle Scholar), known also as L13 (19.Nichols A. Camps M. Gillieron C. Chabert C. Brunet A. Wilsbacher J. Cobb M. Pouyssegur J. Shaw J.P. Arkinstall S. J. Biol.

A. (2003) Cancer Res., in pressGoogle Scholar), and the subdomain X (the αG helix) of the catalytic domain of the kinase (Fig. 1a; subdomain definitions follow Hardie and Hanks (29.Hardie G. Hanks S. The Protein Kinase Facts Book. II. Academic Press Inc., New York1995Google Scholar)). The KinAce™ regions are common to all protein kinases and share characteristic structural patterns, detailed below. We analyzed kinase-substrate interactions in all kinase-substrate, kinase-pseudosubstrate, and kinase-autoinhibitory structures solved to date with <2.8-Å resolution. In addition, we searched the literature for mutational data elucidating the role of residues in these regions. The following is a detailed account of each of the KinAceTM regions. The HJ-αG region (subdomains IX-X of the kinase catalytic domain) corresponds to residues 230EMAAGYPPFFADQPI QIYEKIV251 in cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), and is shown as a red ribbon in Fig. 1a. The three-dimensional framework is common to all protein kinase structures solved so far, as illustrated in Fig. 1b. Sequence and structural alignment of residues in this region from various kinases, reveals a characteristic template. The template consists of a short conserved helix (positions 1–3), a variable strand around a conserved glycine at position 6, a conserved hydrophobic PF or PY dip (positions 9–10) buried in the protein structure, a variable shoulder-like region (positions 11–15), followed by a variable helix (positions 16–22), which is anchored to the protein by two conserved hydrophobic residues (positions 18 and 22). The conserved residues are boxed in blue in Fig. 1d. Highly variable patches interspace the typical sequence pattern of conserved residues as shown in Fig. 1d. Interestingly, conserved regions are buried, whereas the variable spacers are exposed to the solvent and thus available for binding (Fig. 1c). Variability may be responsible for specific recognition of the kinase-binding partners. Several crystallographic (22.Akamine P. Madhusudan Wu J. Xuong N.H. Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. J. Mol.

In Streptomyces venezuelae, there are seven genes required for the biosynthesis of this unusual sugar. One of the genes, desIV, codes for a dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, which is referred to as DesIV. The reaction mechanisms for these types of dehydratases are quite complicated with proton abstraction from the sugar 4′-hydroxyl group and hydride transfer to NAD+, proton abstraction at C-5, and elimination of the hydroxyl group at C-6 of the sugar, and finally return of a proton to C-5 and a hydride from NADH to C-6. Here we describe the cloning, overexpression, and purification, and high resolution x-ray crystallographic analysis to 1.44 Å of wild-type DesIV complexed with dTDP. Additionally, for this study, a double site-directed mutant protein (D128N/E129Q) was prepared, crystallized as a complex with NAD+ and the substrate dTDP-glucose and its structure determined to 1.35 Å resolution. In DesIV, the phenolate group of Tyr151 and Oγ of Thr127 lie at 2.7 and 2.6 Å, respectively from the 4′-hydroxyl group of the dTDP-glucose substrate. The side chain of Asp128 is in the correct position to function as a general acid for proton donation to the 6′-hydroxyl group while the side chain of Glu129 is ideally situated to serve as the general base for proton abstraction at C-5.

This investigation provides further detailed information for understanding the exquisite chemistry that occurs in these remarkable enzymes. Macrolide antibiotics belong to a large family of natural products known as polyketides, which are synthesized by bacteria (primarily actinomycetes and myxobacteria) and fungi (1.Xue Y. Zhao L. Liu H.W. Sherman D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12111-12116Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). These drugs constitute an old and well-established class of anti-microbial agents demonstrating excellent clinical activity against Gram-positive bacteria. While the bactericidal properties are still not completely understood, it is clear that these drugs inhibit protein synthesis by interacting with the ribosome or components thereof (2.Weymouth-Wilson A.C. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1997; 14: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Some of the structural variability among the polyketides is due to postsynthetic steps that often include glycosylation by unique deoxy sugars (3.Tang L. McDaniel R. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 547-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The addition of unusual deoxy sugars such as d-desosamine to many polyketides provides or enhances their biological activity. Strikingly, without these appended sugar(s), the pharmacological properties of many of these compounds are either completely lost or dramatically decreased (2.Weymouth-Wilson A.C. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1997; 14: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In the case of desosamine, a 3-(dimethylamino)-3,4,6-trideoxyhexose, the sugar is thought to be involved in ionic interactions of the associated antibiotic with the bacterial ribosome and specifically with the peptidyl transferase center (4.Schlünzen F. Zarivach R. Harms J. Bashan A. Tocilj A. Albrecht R. Yonath A. Franceschi F. Nature. 2001; 415: 814-821Crossref Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 5.Hansen J.L. Ippolito J.A. Ban N. Nissen P. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 117-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Understanding the in vivo formation of these unusual sugar residues may lead to the eventual construction of novel antibiotics by genetic manipulation of existing biochemical pathways via “combinatorial biosynthesis” (6.Khosla C. Zawada R.J. Trends Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 335-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Among microorganisms, approximately three-fourths of all known bioactive compounds are produced by members of the actinomycete family, mostly belonging to the Streptomyces genus (7.Mendez C. Salas J.A. Trends Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 449-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 15439 produces two distinct groups of macrolide antibiotics with either 12- or 14-membered lactone rings (1.Xue Y. Zhao L. Liu H.W. Sherman D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12111-12116Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). All of these contain the deoxy sugar desosamine. As indicated in Scheme 1, seven genes are thought to be responsible for desosamine biosynthesis, namely desI, desII, desIII, desIV, desV, desVI, and desVIII. These genes are located in the pikB locus that is part of the pikromycin biosynthetic gene cluster (1.Xue Y. Zhao L. Liu H.W. Sherman D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12111-12116Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 8.Chen S. Roberts J.B. Xue Y. Sherman D.H. Reynolds K.A. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 263: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Also present in this cluster is the desVII gene that encodes the glycosyltransferase required for the transfer of desosamine to both the 12- and 14-membered lactone rings. The focus of this structural investigation is dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, which is encoded by the desIV gene and hereafter referred to simply as DesIV. 1The abbreviations used are: DesIV, dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid.1The abbreviations used are: DesIV, dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid. This enzyme catalyzes the second step in the desosamine pathway by oxidizing the 4′-hydroxyl group and removing the 6′-hydroxyl group of the dTDP-glucose substrate (Scheme 1). On the basis of amino acid sequence analyses, DesIV is known to be a member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily (SDR), containing the highly conserved Tyr-X-X-X-Lys catalytic couple (9.Kallberg Y. Oppermann U. Jörnvall H. Persson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4409-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Members of this superfamily catalyze a wide range of biochemical reactions with some displaying dehydrogenase activities, while others acting as dehydratases, isomerases, or epimerases, for example (10.Jörnvall H.

The x-ray structures of the dTDP 4,6-dehydratases from Salmonella enterica and Streptococcus suis, alone or in complex with various dTDP sugars, have been determined thus far (13.Allard S.T.M.

In addition, we describe the construction and x-ray structural analysis to 1.35 Å resolution of a double site-directed mutant protein (D128N/E129Q) containing NAD+ and the substrate, dTDP-glucose. Taken together, these two structures provide a molecular framework within which to elaborate more fully the detailed chemistry that occurs during catalysis. Cloning of the DesIV Gene—The sequence of the S. venezuelae desIV gene has been reported (1.Xue Y. Zhao L. Liu H.W. Sherman D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12111-12116Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and allowed for the design of primers for gene amplification from genomic DNA. S. venezuelae ATCC 15439 genomic DNA was obtained as a freeze-dried pellet from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify the desIV gene for cloning into the pET-28a (Novagen) expression vector to produce a C-terminal His6-tagged fusion protein. The forward primer, 5′-CATGCCATGGCACGGCTTCTGGTGACCGGA-3′, contains an NcoI restriction site (in bold). The reverse primer, 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGCGGACACCTCCAC-3′ has an XhoI site (in bold). In order to preserve the NcoI recognition sequence of CCATGG, the codon GCC (encoding alanine) was inserted before the second residue of the gene. The gene was PCR-amplified with Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and standard cycling conditions. The PCR product was purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen Inc.), followed by digestion with both NcoI and XhoI at 37 °C overnight. The gene was separated from digestion byproducts on a 1.0% agarose gel, excised from the gel, and purified with QIAquick Gel purification kit. The purified desIV gene was then ligated into the NcoI/XhoI sites of pET-28a (Novagen) that had previously been cut with the same restriction enzymes. Escherichia coli DH5α cells were transformed with the ligation mixture and subsequently plated onto LB media supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin. Individual colonies were selected, cultured overnight, and plasmid DNA extracted with the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen Inc.). Positive clones were identified by digestion of the plasmid DNA with appropriate restriction enzymes and visualization of the excised insert by staining the agarose gel with ethidium bromide following electrophoresis. The positive clones were sequenced with the ABI Prism™ Big Dye Primer Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) to confirm that no mutations were introduced during PCR amplification. Protein Expression—For protein expression, E. coli Rosetta-(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) cells were transformed with the pET28a-desIV plasmid and plated onto LB media supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin. After ∼16 h of incubation, the plates were scraped, and the cells were suspended in LB media to use for the inoculation of 6 × 2-liter baffled flasks containing 500 ml of Terrific Broth (16.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2001Google Scholar) plus 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The cells were grown at 37 °C with aeration to an OD600 of ∼0.6, at which time they were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were allowed to grow for an additional 4 h before harvesting by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 8 min. The cell paste was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Protein Purification—All protein purification procedures were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. The cell paste was thawed in 100 ml of cold Ni-NTA lysis buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole at pH 8.0. Cells were lysed on ice by six cycles of sonication (30 s) separated by 2 min of cooling. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 25 min at 20,000 × g. The clarified lysate was loaded onto a 10-ml Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen Inc.) column pre-equilibrated with Ni-NTA lysis buffer. After loading, the column was washed with about 60 ml of Ni-NTA wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole at pH 8.0), followed by gradient elution of the protein from 20 to 500 mm imidazole in Ni-NTA lysis buffer. Protein-containing fractions were pooled based on SDS-PAGE analysis and dialyzed against 25 mm Tris (pH 7.6) with 200 mm NaCl. The dialyzed protein was concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml based on an extinction coefficient of ∼0.73 mg/ml as calculated by the program Protean (DNAstar, Inc., Madison, WI). Enzymatic Assay—The assay is based upon that described in Ref. 17.Okazaki R. Okazaki T. Strominger J.L. Michelson A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3014-3026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and follows the formation of a unique, broad UV chromophore centered at 318 nm following incubation of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose in 0.1 m NaOH at 310 K for 20 min. The structure of the species responsible for this chromophore has not yet been determined. In addition, several different values for the extinction coefficient for this species have been utilized. The value employed in this investigation was 6500 m-1 cm-1, as recently re-determined by Gross et al. (18.Gross J.W. Hegeman A.D. Vestling M.M. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13633-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All readings were done in triplicate. Between 10 and 50 μg of DesIV were transferred into a sterile 1-ml Eppendorf tube containing 86 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6 and 2.5 μl of 40mm NAD+. A1-μl sample of 100 mm dTDP-d-glucose was added, and the sample incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Subsequently, 1 ml of 0.1 m NaOH was then added, and the sample incubated for a further 20 min at 37 °C. The spectrophotometer was zeroed against 0.1 m NaOH, and the absorbance of the sample recorded at 318 nm in a quartz cuvette. Negative controls were set up in the same manner as described above but omitting the substrate. Only active DesIV protein samples were employed for crystallization trials. Crystallization of DesIV—Initial trials were conducted by the hanging drop method of vapor diffusion with Hampton Research screens I and II (Hampton Research). The protein concentration was typically 10 mg/ml. Prior to crystallization, the protein was incubated with 2 mm dTDP overnight at 4 °C. Single crystals were observed growing after 4 days at 4 °C in 20% poly(ethylene glycol) 8000, 200 mm magnesium acetate tetrahydrate, and 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5. Refinement of the crystallization conditions led to large single crystals being grown via the batch method at 4 °C with a precipitant solution containing 7% poly(ethylene glycol) 8000, 100 mm magnesium acetate tetrahydrate, and 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.3. Crystals achieved typical dimensions of ∼0.8 mm × 0.8 mm × 0.8 mm in 3 days. The crystals belonged to space group P21212 with unit cell dimensions of a = 75.5 Å, b = 99.8 Å, c = 42.2 Å and one monomer per asymmetric unit. High Resolution X-ray Data Collection—For high resolution x-ray data collection, the crystals were transferred to solutions of a synthetic mother liquor containing increasing concentrations of glycerol (5-30% in 5% increments). Each crystal was subsequently flash-cooled to -150 °C in a stream of nitrogen gas and subsequently stored under liquid nitrogen until synchrotron beamtime became available. X-ray data were collected from a single crystal on a 3 × 3 tiled “SBC3” CCD detector at the Structural Biology Center 19-BM beamline (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL) to a nominal resolution of 1.44 Å. The x-ray data were processed with HKL2000 and scaled with SCALEPACK (19.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar).

Visual inspection of the solution with the graphics program TURBO (21.Roussel A. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Cambillau C.

Alternate cycles of least-squares refinement with the software package TNT (22.Tronrud D.E. Ten Eyck L.F. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Relevant least-squares refinement statistics are summarized in Table II. DesIV contains 337 amino acid residues per subunit. In the model presented here, the final amino acid observed in the electron density map was Lys322. Other than the C-terminal residues, however, the electron density for the rest of the polypeptide chain was unambiguous. There were no significant outliers in the Ramachandran plot.Table IILeast-squares refinement statisticsWild-type enzymeD128N/E129Q mutant proteinResolution limits (Å)30.0-1.4430.0-1.35R-factor (overall)aR-factor=(∑|Fo-Fc|/∑|Fo|)×100 where Fo is the observed structure-factor amplitude and Fc is the calculated structure-factor amplitude. %/no. reflections17.7/57,82817.6/61,664R-factor (working) %/no. reflections17.6/52,09917.4/55,477R-factor (free) %/no. reflections23.1/5,72921.6/6,187No. protein atoms2,4922,511No. hetero-atoms348452Average B values (Å2)Protein atoms25.119.2NAD+17.113.3dTDP18.516.4Solvents37.834.7Weighted root-mean square deviations from idealityBond lengths (Å)0.0130.014Bond angles (deg)2.342.35Trigonal planes (Å)0.0080.007General planes (Å)0.0150.013Torsional anglesbThe torsional angles were not restrained during the refinement.

Open table in a new tab Preparation and Structural Analysis of the D128N/E129Q Site-directed Mutant Protein—The double mutant protein, D128N/E129Q, was created with the original plasmid containing the desIV gene. The mutations were generated by PCR amplification using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Purified primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Plasmids harvested from the mutagenesis reactions were screened and sequenced with the ABI PRISM Big Dye Primer Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Protein expression and purification of the double mutant protein was similar to that described above for the wild-type enzyme. The D128N/E129Q mutant protein demonstrated no activity with the above-described assay. Potential crystallization conditions were examined with Hampton Research screens I and II at 4 °C by the hanging drop method of vapor diffusion. The D128N/E129Q mutant protein, at 10 mg/ml, was incubated with 20 mm dTDP-glucose for 4 h at 4 °C. Crystals were observed growing at 4 °C in 20% poly(ethylene glycol) 8000, 200 mm magnesium acetate tetrahydrate, and 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH. 6.5. Refinement of the crystallization conditions led to large single crystals grown by macroseeding into batch experiments with precipitant concentrations of 5% poly(ethylene glycol) 8000, 50 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm cacodylate (pH 6.5). Crystals achieved typical dimensions of ∼0.6 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm3 in 1-2 weeks and belonged to the orthorhombic space group P21212 with unit cell dimensions of a = 71.7 Å, b = 99.4 Å, and c = 42.2 Å and one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Crystals were harvested from the batch experiments and soaked for several hours in a synthetic mother liquor composed of 15% poly(ethylene glycol) 8000, 50 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10.0 mm dTDP-glucose, and 100 mm cacodylate (pH 6.5). These crystals were then serially transferred to a cryoprotectant solution composed of 25% poly(ethylene glycol) 8000, 50 mm MgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 10.0 mm dTDP-glucose, 15% ethylene glycol, and 100 mm cacodylate (pH 6.5). The crystals were flash-cooled to -150 °C in a stream of nitrogen gas. X-ray data were collected with a HiStar (Bruker AXS) area detector system using CuKα radiation generated from a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode generator operated at 50 kV and 90 mA and equipped with Göbel focusing optics. The x-ray data were processed with XDS (23.Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 67-71Crossref Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 24.Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1681) Google Scholar) and scaled with XSCALIBRE. 3I. Rayment and G. Wesenberg, unpublished results. Relevant x-ray data collection statistics are presented in Table I. The structure of the D128N/E129Q mutant protein was solved via molecular replacement with the wild-type structure as the search model and refined in a similar manner to that described above. Refinement statistics are presented in Table II and a representative portion of the electron density map near the ligands is shown in Fig. 1. Again, there were no significant outliers in the Ramachandran plot. Determination of the Redox State of the Dinucleotide in D128N/E129Q Protein Crystals—All procedures were conducted at 4 °C. Thirty crystals from the same batch experiment employed for x-ray data collection were carefully removed and swiftly washed in 0.1 micron-filtered water (Anatop 10, Whatman). They were then transferred to 100 μl of fresh 0.1-micron filtered water and gently dissolved. Aliquots of this crystal mixture (20 μl) were subsequently added to 80 μl of the following solutions: 8 m urea, 100% ethanol, and 200 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The ethanol solution was mixed and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min to precipitate the protein. The supernatant containing the free dinucleotide was carefully removed for analysis. The 8 m urea solution was used to denature the protein to enable the measurement of free dinucleotide in the presence of denatured enzyme, while the phosphate buffer was utilized to allow observation of the undenatured complex. All solutions were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20 °C until required. Absorption spectra were measured from 220 to 600 nm for all three samples with a Cary 300 Scan UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian). If present, NADH would be detectable at these protein concentrations (1.03 mg/ml as estimated from the phosphate buffer spectrum A280) by its absorbance at 340 nm (ϵ340 = 6.22 mm-1 cm-1). No significant absorbance features, however, were observed at this wavelength. The protein free sample (80% ethanol supernatant) showed a strong 262 nm band (A262 = 0.814) and none at 340 nm, consistent with the assignment of NAD+ to the electron density observed in the crystalline lattice. In summary, these data indicate, within the threshold of detection, that the bound nucleotide is in the oxidized state in the D128N/E129Q mutant protein crystals. Structure of the Wild-type DesIV Complexed with dTDP—A ribbon representation of the DesIV monomer is displayed in Fig. 2a. The molecule has overall dimensions of ∼48 × 60 × 45 Å3 and consists of two domains: the N-terminal motif formed by Met1 to Tyr182 and Thr220 to Gly245 and the C-terminal region delineated by Gly183 to His219 and Leu246 to Lys322. The N-terminal domain, responsible for cradling the NAD+, contains seven strands of parallel β-sheet (Met1 to Val5, Glu32 to Asp37, Arg58 to His61, Ala79 to His82, Arg121 to Thr127, Val173 to Tyr182, and Ile239 to Ile242). These β-strands are connected by seven α-helices (ranging in length from six to twenty amino acids) and nine reverse turns (six Type I, two Type II, and one Type III). The two largest of these α-helices, Ala96 to Ala114 and Pro150 to Tyr169, are involved in subunit:subunit interactions as discussed below. The C-terminal domain, responsible for dTDP positioning, is dominated by a three stranded mixed β-sheet formed by Val214 to His219, Leu246 to Thr249, and Arg280 to Leu283 and a two stranded parallel β-sheet (Leu205 to Leu207 and Val268 to Val271). Additionally, there are five α-helices and six classical reverse turns (three Type I, two Type II, and one Type II′) in the C-terminal domain. The β-phosphoryl group of dTDP lies within ∼6 Å of the nicotinamide ring of the dinucleotide within the cleft formed by the N- and C-terminal domains. DesIV is known to be a dimer. The enzyme crystallized with its local 2-fold rotational axis coincident to a crystallographic dyad, thereby reducing the contents of the asymmetric unit to one monomer. A ribbon representation of the dimer, generated by crystallographic symmetry, is displayed in Fig. 2b. The dimer has overall dimensions of ∼74 × 88 × 45 Å3 and a total buried surface area of ∼2440 Å2 as calculated according the algorithm of Lee and Richards (25.Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5293) Google Scholar). Three regions from the N-terminal domains of each subunit contribute to the dimeric interface: Ile93 to Gln108, Pro144 to Ser149, and Leu160 to Tyr169. This interface is characterized by numerous hydrogen bonds formed between side chain functional groups from one subunit and backbone atoms from another or between side chain groups contributed by each subunit. In addition, there are numerous water molecules located between the two subunits and several hydrophobic side chains project into the dimeric interface including Ile93, Pro144, Leu145, Pro147, Leu160, and Val161 (from each subunit). The major α-helices forming the subunit:subunit boundary run parallel to one another within the individual monomers but anti-parallel between subunits. Active Site Geometry—A close-up view of the DesIV active site with bound NAD+ and dTDP is presented in Fig. 3a.Ascan be seen, the thymine ring of the dTDP ligand is wedged into a fairly hydrophobic pocket composed of Leu191, Leu194, Phe195, Pro206, Leu207, and Tyr208. The aromatic side chain of Tyr208 participates in a parallel stacking interaction with the thymine ring of the ligand. A schematic of the hydrogen bonding pattern around the dTDP is presented in Fig. 3b. The carbonyl oxygens of the thymine ring, at positions 2 and 4, lie within hydrogen bonding distance to the peptidic NH group of Tyr208 and a water molecule, respectively. The ring nitrogen, at position 3, forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Pro206. As expected, the ribose moiety of the dTDP ligand adopts the C2′-endo form. The 3-hydroxyl group of the ribose lies within 3.0 Å of Nδ2 of Asn250 and 2.6 Å of Nϵ2 of His277. One of the α-phosphoryl oxygens forms electrostatic interactions with a water molecule and the backbone peptidic NH group of Leu191 while the second α-phosphoryl oxygen is positioned within hydrogen bonding distance to the side chains of His88 and Arg274 and a water molecule. This particular water molecule also lies within ∼3 Å of the bridging oxygen between the α- and β-phosphorus atoms, and one of the β-phosphoryl oxygens. Two of the β-phosphoryl oxygens form salt bridges with the guanidinium groups of Arg215 and Arg274, respectively. Interestingly, the side chain of Glu129, a residue thought to be important in the reaction mechanism, is located at 2.5 Å from the third β-phosphoryl oxygen thereby suggesting that in this complex the carboxylate group of Glu129 is protonated (Fig. 3b). The NAD+ lies across the C-terminal edge of the seven-stranded parallel β-sheet and is surrounded by ten water molecules within 3.2 Å. Both riboses of the NAD+ adopt the C2′-endo conformation and the nicotinamide ring is in the syn-conformation as would be expected for a B-side specific enzyme. There is an intramolecular hydrogen bond (2.8 Å) between the carboxamide group of the nicotinamide ring and one of its phosphoryl oxygens. Numerous backbone peptidic groups point toward the dinucleotide including those donated by Phe11, Ile12, Ser38, Thr40, Ile64, and Asn181. Five side chains serve to anchor the NAD+ to the protein: Asp37,"

In contrast, phosphorylation of the EGF-R, Shc, and ERK1/2 by EGF and HB-EGF was independent of PKC and metalloprotease activity. The signaling characteristics of HB-EGF closely resembled those of GnRH and EGF in terms of the phosphorylation of EGF-R, Shc, ERK1/2, and RSK-1 as well as the nuclear translocation of RSK-1. However, neither the selective Src kinase inhibitor PP2 nor the overexpression of negative regulatory Src kinase and dominant negative Pyk2 had any effect on HB-EGF-induced responses. In contrast to GT1-7 cells, human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing the GnRH-R did not exhibit metalloprotease induction and EGF-R transactivation during GnRH stimulation. These data indicate that the GnRH-induced transactivation of the EGF-R and the subsequent ERK1/2 phosphorylation result from ectodomain shedding of HBEGF through PKC-dependent activation of metalloprotease(s) in neuronal GT1-7 cells.

Cells utilize a wide variety of signaling pathways in transducing signals from plasma membrane receptors to mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloprotease; CRM, diphtheria toxin mutant; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGF-R, EGF-receptor; GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone; GPCR, G proteincoupled receptor; HA, hemagglutinin A; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293 (cells); HB-EGF, heparin-binding EGF; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; Pyk2, proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RSK-1, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; TGF, transforming growth factor. especially the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). The MAPKs are involved in cell survival, growth, secretion, chemotaxis, and motility (1.Luttrell L.M. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2002; 80: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 2.Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 368-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that MAPK activation by external stimuli, such as G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists, cytokines, growth hormones, steroids and environmental stresses, occurs through transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), in particular the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R). RTK tyrosine phosphorylation leads to recruitment of specific signaling proteins and adaptor molecules, culminating in sequential activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade (3.Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 2002; 3: 639-650Google Scholar, 4.Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of ERK activation by RTKs is well defined, the steps leading from GPCR stimulation to RTK tyrosine phosphorylation and activation are only partially understood (5.Lowes V.L. Ip N.Y. Wong Y.H. Neurosignals. 2002; 11: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A major potential mechanism of the cross-communication between GPCRs and RTKs is the activation of metalloproteases that cause proteolytic cleavage of the transmembrane, proheparin-binding EGF precursor to yield the soluble ligand HBEGF, which binds to and activates the EGF-R (6.Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). The signaling characteristics downstream of EGF-R phosphorylation in response to stimulation by either EGF or HB-EGF are indistinguishable. Thus, GPCRs that cause MAP kinase activation through transactivation of the EGF-R mimic the signaling pathways downstream of the EGF-R (7.Gschwind A. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Leserer M. Ullrich A.

Metalloproteases are a large family of proteolytic enzymes that include the matrix metalloproteases, the ADAMs (adisintegrin and metalloprotease), and the ADAMTS (ADAM with thrombospondin type I motifs). Metalloproteases contribute to both normal and pathological tissue remodeling by regulating the processing of matrix proteins, cytokines, growth factors, and adhesion molecules to generate fragments with enhanced or reduced biological effects (6.Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 12.Armiento J.D. Trends Cardiovasc.

In this context, increasing evidence points to members of the ADAM family of metalloproteases as the key enzymes responsible for the processing of growth factor precursors. For example, the action of ADAM12 on HB-EGF processing in cells stimulated by GPCR agonists, including angiotensin II, endothelin, and phenylephrine, has been shown to cause myoid cell growth and cardiac hypertrophy (14.Asakura M. Kitakaze M. Takashima S. Liao Y. Ishikura F. Yoshinaka T. Ohmoto H. Node K. Yoshino K. Ishiguro H. Asanuma H. Sanada S. Matsumara Y. Takeda H. Beppu S. Tada M. Hori M. Hagashiyama S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Similarly, ADAM10 mediates EGF-R transactivation by stimulation of bombesin receptors transiently expressed in COS cells (15.Yan Y. Shirakabe K. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Although there is substantial evidence that ectodomain shedding through metalloproteases by various GPCRs occurs upstream of RTKs (6.Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C.

Horiguchi Y. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30475-30482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We have recently defined an essential role of EGF-R transactivation in GnRH-induced MAPK signaling in GT1-7 neuronal cells (11.Shah B.H. Soh J.-W. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2866-2875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and our preliminary results suggested metalloprotease involvement in this cascade (18.Shah B.H. Farshori M.P. Jambusaria A. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19118-19126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is well established that metalloprotease activation can cause the release of several ligands and growth factors that can interact with RTKs. These include HB-EGF, transforming growth factor α (TGF-α), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) (19.Seals D.F. Courtneidge S.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 7-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism(s) of metalloprotease-dependent transactivation of the EGF-R and the subsequent MAPK activation by GnRH have not been identified. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), a primary regulatory factor in the neuroendocrine control of reproduction, is released in an episodic manner to stimulate pituitary gonadotropin secretion and also exerts autocrine regulatory actions on hypothalamic GnRH neurons (20.Krsmanovic L.Z. Mores N. Navarro C.E. Arora K.K. Catt K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2969-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). GnRH released from the hypothalamus acts on anterior pituitary gonadotropes to stimulate the synthesis and release of the pituitary gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) (21.Stojilkovic S.S. Catt K.J. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 7: 739-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The GnRH receptor belongs to the class of GPCRs that are coupled to heterotrimeric Gq proteins. GnRH-induced activation of ERK1/2 in immortalized hypothalamic neurons (GT1-7 cells), which closely resemble native hypothalamic neurons in terms of their signaling characteristics and pulsatile neurosecretion (20.Krsmanovic L.Z.

Chem. 2003; 278: 2866-2875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the formation of metalloprotease-dependent release of HB-EGF and its role in agonist-induced MAPK signaling have not been investigated in neuronal cells. Here we show that GnRH-mediated transactivation of the EGF-R and the subsequent phosphorylation of Shc, ERK1/2, and RSK-1 are attenuated by the inhibition of metalloprotease activity and blockade of the effects of HB-EGF. Moreover, HBEGF mimics the effects of EGF as shown by tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF-R and the activation of downstream signaling molecules in GT1-7 cells.

The 1020-base pair mouse GnRH receptor cDNA tagged with an N-terminal HA epitope was subcloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector between the Bgl11 and SmaI sites. The HA-GnRH cDNA cloned into pEGFP-N1 MCS was expressed as a fusion protein bound to the N terminus of pEGFP. The pEGFP-N1 vector encodes a variant of wildtype green fluorescent protein (GFP) with enhanced fluorescence. For stable transfection, HEK293 cells were cultured in 24-well plates and transfected with 500 ng of subcloned HA-GnRH-GFP cDNA in opti-MEM containing 3 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 for 2 h. After 24 h, cells were trypsinized and plated in 100-mm culture dishes at low density (100–500 cells/dish). The next day, incubation was continued in culture medium containing 200 μm G418 for selection. Several colonies were obtained within 2 weeks of selection, and studies were performed on a stably transfected HEK293 cell line. Inositol Phosphate Measurements—Cells were labeled for 24 h in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 μCi/ml [3H]inositol as described previously (5.Lowes V.L. Ip N.Y. Wong Y.H. Neurosignals. 2002; 11: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and then washed twice with inositol-free M199 medium and stimulated at 37 °C in the presence of 10 mm LiCl. The reactions were stopped with perchloric acid, inositol phosphates were extracted, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation γ-spectrometry. Immunoprecipitation—After treatment with inhibitors and drugs, cells were placed on ice, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, lysed in lysis buffer (LB) containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 0.25% sodium-deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and probe-sonicated (Sonifier cell disruptor). Solubilized lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 10 min, precleared with agarose, and then incubated with specific antibodies and protein A- or G-agarose. The immunoprecipitates were collected, washed four times with LB, and dissolved in Laemmli buffer. After heating at 95 °C for 5 min, the samples were centrifuged briefly, and the supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 8–16% gradient gels. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were grown in 6-well plates and, at 60–70% confluence, were serum-starved for 24 h before treatment at 37 °C with selected agents. The media were then aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were briefly sonicated, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged for 5 min. The supernatant was electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE (8–16%) gradient gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies and washed three times with Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBST) before probing with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were then visualized with ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia or Pierce) and quantitated with a scanning laser densitometer. In some cases, blots were stripped and reprobed with other antibodies. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were plated at low density on poly-l-lysine coated glass coverslips for 24 h and then rinsed and incubated in serum-free medium for 12–24 h. Cells were then treated with GnRH or EGF for the time periods indicated. Following stimulation, cells were rinsed in warm PBS and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min. They were then permeabilized by immersing cover slips in 100% methanol for 5 min and incubated at 37 °C in blocking medium (3% bovine serum albumin and 3% normal goat serum) for 60 min. Following incubation in primary antibodies diluted (1:50) in blocking medium, cover slips were washed thrice with PBS and incubated with Texas Red-labeled goat anti-rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit or antimouse antibodies. After washing with PBS and mounting in ProLong medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), images were taken with a Bio-Rad confocal microscope. In GT1-7 neuronal cells, which express endogenous receptors for both GnRH and EGF, activation of ERK1/2 by either of these ligands was abrogated by the selective EGF-R kinase inhibitor AG1478, consistent with the dependence of GnRH-induced ERK1/2 activation upon transactivation of the EGF-R (Fig. 1A). This was confirmed by the ability of GnRH to cause tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF-R as revealed by immunoprecipitation of the EGF-R and immunoblotting with phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) (Fig. 1B). Recent studies have shown that metalloprotease induction by GPCRs or RTKs causes the release of cytokines and growth factors such as TGF-α or -β and HB-EGF. Whether this mechanism is operative in neurons during GnRH action is not known. To evaluate the involvement of metalloproteases in GnRH-induced transactivation of the EGF-R, GT1-7 cells were pretreated with the metalloprotease inhibitor GM6001 and stimulated with GnRH or EGF. As shown in Fig. 2A, GM6001 abolished GnRH-induced phosphorylation of the EGF-R and the subsequent activation of ERK1/2 and its dependent protein, RSK-1. However, GM6001 had no inhibitory effect on EGF-R phosphorylation and ERK1/2 activation induced by EGF stimulation (Fig. 2B). These findings demonstrate the specificity of GM6001 and also indicate the dependence of GnRH signaling on metalloprotease action upstream of the EGF-R. Recent studies have shown that the soluble EGF-like ligand, HB-EGF, is generated by proteolytic processing of the proHBEGF precursor by metalloproteases in response to external stimuli. HB-EGF, in turn, binds to the EGF-R and causes its activation and phosphorylation (6.Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 7.Gschwind A. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Leserer M. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 23.Reynolds C.M. Eguchi S. Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Hypertension. 2002; 39: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To find out if this mechanism is operative in GT1-7 cells, we determined whether GnRH-induced ERK1/2 activation results from the release of TGF-α or HB-EGF through proteolytic processing by metalloproteases. As shown in Fig. 3A, a diphtheria toxin mutant (CRM) that selectively inactivates HB-EGF attenuated the effects of GnRH and HB-EGF. Furthermore, the addition of the anti-HB-EGF antibody (20 μg/ml) diminished the ERK1/2 activation induced by GnRH and HB-EGF (Fig. 3B). In contrast, EGF-induced ERK1/2 activation was not affected by CRM or the antibody against HB-EGF (Fig. 3C). In GT1-7 cells, TGF-α had no effect on ERK1/2 activation, thus excluding its involvement in this cascade (data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that GnRH-induced activation of the ERK1/2 pathway through activation of the EGF-R requires the formation of HB-EGF through GM6001-sensitive metalloprotease(s). EGF-induced activation of EGF-R tyrosine kinase leads to the recruitment of adaptor molecules such as Shc, Grb2, and Sos, which initiate ERK1/2 signaling through the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway (4.Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar, 24.Jorissen R.N. Walker F. Pouliot N. Garrett T.P.J. Ward C.W. Burgess A.W. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 31-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). To determine whether HB-EGF likewise causes ERK activation through phosphorylation of the EGF-R, we examined the signaling pathways activated by HB-EGF in GT1-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, A–C, HB-EGF treatment caused significant but transient phosphorylation of the EGF-R and its adaptor protein, Shc, as well as of ERK1/2 and RSK-1. The stimulatory effects of HB-EGF on phosphorylation of the EGF-R and ERK1/2 were abolished by AG1478, a selective antagonist of EGF-R kinase (Fig. 5), but not by metalloprotease inhibition (Fig. 6). These data clearly indicate that HB-EGF release is responsible for GnRH-induced transactivation of the EGF-R in GT1-7 cells.Fig. 5HB-EGF causes ERK1/2 activation through phosphorylation of the EGF-R. Inhibitory effects of the selective EGF-R kinase antagonist, AG1478, on HB-EGF-induced phosphorylation (P-) of EGF-R (A) and ERK1/2 (B). GT1-7 cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations of AG1478 and stimulated with HB-EGF (10 ng/ml) for 5 min.

Con, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have recently shown that the signaling characteristics of GPCR agonists such as angiotensin II and GnRH, which cause ERK1/2 activation through EGF-R transactivation, resemble those of EGF stimulation. For example, both GnRH and EGF fail to cause nuclear translocation of activated ERK1/2 in GT1-7 cells but act through RSK-1 to induce transcriptional responses in the nucleus (18.Shah B.H. Farshori M.P. Jambusaria A. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19118-19126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To determine whether HB-EGF mimics the effects of EGF stimulation, we examined its actions on the phosphorylation and cellular localization of RSK-1 in GT1-7 cells. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that HBEGF treatment stimulated phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of RSK-1 in GT1-7 cells in a manner similar to that of GnRH and EGF. As expected, phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of RSK-1 was abolished by the selective EGF-R antagonist AG1478, confirming the ability of HB-EGF to transduce signals through activation of the EGF-R in GT1-7 cells (Fig. 7). Although GPCR-mediated transactivation of RTKs is well documented in several cell types, there is no consensus about the nature of the upstream mediators involved in this cascade. In GT1-7 cells, PKC is the predominant second messenger during GnRH-induced ERK1/2 activation (11.Shah B.H. Soh J.-W. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2866-2875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, ERK1/2 activation by the PKC activator, PMA, was attenuated by the metalloprotease inhibitor GM6001 (Fig. 8A), indicating the potential role of PKC in agonist-induced release of HB-EGF in GT1-7 cells. Furthermore, PMA-induced ERK1/2 activation was attenuated by the selective EGF-R kinase antagonist AG1478 (Fig. 8B). Moreover, PKC depletion by prolonged PMA treatment (1 μm for 16 h) abolished ERK1/2 activation by GnRH but not by HB-EGF or EGF (Fig. 8C). These data further provide evidence in support of the intermediary role of PKC in metalloprotease induction in GT1-7 cells. The mechanism of GPCR-mediated metalloprotease activation is not fully understood, and several signaling molecules have been implicated in this process in various cell types (6.Prenzel N. Zwick E.

We observed that the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which acts by increasing intracellular glutathione levels, decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation by GnRH in a concentration-dependent manner but had no effect on EGF-induced responses (Fig. 9). Moreover, overexpression of dominant negative Pyk2 had no effect on HB-EGF-induced ERK1/2 responses (data not shown) in contrast to its inhibition of ERK1/2 by GnRH (11.Shah B.H. Soh J.-W. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2866-2875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These data indicate that intermediary signaling molecules such as ROS, Src, and Pyk2 exert important regulatory actions upstream of agonist-induced HB-EGF generation in GT1-7 cells. As in GT1-7 cells, EGF-Rs are endogenously expressed in renal HEK293 cells, and their stimulation causes marked activation of the ERK1/2 cascade (18.Shah B.H. Farshori M.P. Jambusaria A. Catt K.J. J.

The transcriptional activity of RORα is dependent on the presence of a ubiquitous ligand and can be abolished by interaction with Hairless (Hr), a ligand-oblivious nuclear receptor co-repressor. In this study, we first demonstrate that RORα is a short-lived protein and that treatment with the MG-132 proteasome inhibitor results in the accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated receptor and inhibition of transcription. These data show that RORα transcriptional activity and degradation are intrinsically linked. In addition, the introduction of inactivation mutations in the ligand-binding pocket and co-regulator-binding surface of RORα significantly increases protein stability, indicating that ligand and/or co-regulator binding perpetuates RORα degradation. Strikingly, expression of the co-repressor Hr results in the stabilization of RORα because of an inhibition of proteasome-mediated degradation of the receptor. Stabilization of RORα by Hr requires intact nuclear receptor recognition LXXLL motifs within Hr. Interestingly, the co-repressor nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR) has no effect on RORα protein turnover. This study shows that stabilization of RORα is an essential component of Hr-mediated repression and suggests a molecular mechanism to achieve transcriptional repression by a liganded receptor-co-repressor complex.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is the major system employed by eukaryotes for the selective degradation of cellular proteins that play key roles in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, differentiation, signal transduction, transcription, and chromosomal stabilization (reviewed in Refs. 1Voges D.

The conjugation of Ub, a highly conserved 8.6-kDa protein, to its target protein is mediated by the serial action of three enzymes: E1, the Ub-activating enzyme, activates Ub in an ATP-dependent manner; E2, the Ub-conjugating enzyme, catalyzes the attachment of Ub to the substrate protein; and E3, the Ub-ligases, serves as a scaffold between E2 and the substrate and provides recognition specificity of the substrate. Ubiquitinylation of a substrate is reversible, and Ub moieties can be cleaved from a target protein by deubiquitinating enzymes. These enzymes assure that the cell is not depleted of a Ub pool. A protein tagged with a polyubiquitin chain is recognized and degraded by the 26 S proteasome complex. This complex is composed of a 19 S regulatory subcomplex, consisting of a “lid” subunit and a “base” subunit, the latter containing the six ATPases required for the degradation executed by the 20 S catalytic subcomplex (2Glickman M.H.

A number of nuclear receptors, including the estrogen, progesterone, glucocorticoid, retinoic acid, and thyroid hormone receptors, as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, are degraded in a ligand-dependent fashion (5Lonard D.M.

Corepressors such as NCoR and co-activators such as members of the steroid receptor co-activator (SRC) family and CREB-binding protein are also substrates for proteasome-mediated degradation (5Lonard D.M.

A number of these co-factors have been identified as Ubproteasome or Ub-like pathway enzymes, with a role in both proteasomal degradation and transcriptional activation. The E3 Ub-ligases RSP5/RPF1 and the E6-associated protein and the ATPase subunit of the 26 S proteasome SUG1 (suppressor of Gal4) all participate in nuclear receptor transactivation while simultaneously mediating their degradation (17Nawaz Z.

Recently, p300/CREB-binding protein has been shown to mediate the polyubiquitination of the p53 transcription factor through its intrinsic Ub-ligase activity in addition to its function as a transcriptional co-activator (23Grossman S.R.

This dual action of p300/CREB-binding protein adds strong evidence that the Ub-proteasome pathway plays a direct regulatory role in transcription. Indication that transcriptional activation and protein degradation occur concomitantly is further supported by the loss of nuclear receptor-mediated transcriptional activation observed upon inhibition of the 26 S proteasome function (5Lonard D.M.

This observation suggests that the Ub-proteasomal complex is integral to nuclear receptor-mediated transcription. Down-regulation of an activation complex may be required for the exchange of co-activator complexes leading to disruption of the preinitiation complex, thereby allowing transcriptional elongation to proceed. The cell can then recycle components of the activation complex necessary for the initiation of a second round of transcription. This pathway provides a means of preventing the overstimulation by hormone (25Reid G. Denger S. Kos M. Gannon F. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). RORα (retinoic acid-related orphan receptor α; NR1F1) is a member of the ROR subfamily, which also includes RORβ (NR1F2) and RORγ (NR1F3), each regulating diverse physiological processes (26Jetten A.M. Ueda E. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1167-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Genetic ablation of the rora gene mimics the staggerer phenotype that is caused by massive neurodegeneration of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum (27Hamilton B.A. Frankel W.N. Kerrebrock A.W.

RORα knock-out and staggerer mice also serve as a model for age-related degenerative pathologies because they exhibit greater susceptibility to atherosclerosis, immunodeficiencies linked to an overexpression of inflammatory cytokines, abnormal formation and maintenance of bone, and changes in muscle differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 30Jarvis C.I. Staels B. Brugg B. Lemaigre-Dubreuil Y. Tedgui A. Mariani J. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2002; 186: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). RORα is a potent transcriptional activator even in the absence of exogenously added ligand. However, the recent resolution of the crystal structures of RORα and RORβ ligand-binding domains (LBDs), in combination with mutagenesis assays of the RORα LBD, suggest that members of the ROR family require that their LBD be occupied by a ligand for transcriptional activation to occur (31Stehlin C.

Structure. 2002; 10: 1697-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Regulation of RORα transcriptional activity is also mediated through co-regulator recruitment. RORα has been shown to interact with members of the SRC family and the p300/CREB-binding protein co-integrators (32Moraitis A.N. Giguère V. Thompson C.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6831-6841Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 34Atkins G.B. Hu X. Guenther M.G. Rachez C. Freedman L.P. Lazar M.A. Mol.

Repression of RORα activity can be achieved by displacement from its binding site by the transcriptionally inactive orphan nuclear receptors RevErbAα and RVR (36Retnakaran R. Flock G. Giguère V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1234-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 37Forman B. Chen J. Blumberg B. Kliewer S.A. Henshaw R. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 1860-1867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and possibly by an active mechanism through interaction with the co-repressors NCoR and SMRT, although the effect of NCoR expression on RORα activity is negligible (39Harding H.P. Atkins G.B. Jaffe A.B. Seo W.J. Lazar M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1737-1746PubMed Google Scholar). However, more recently, RORα transcriptional activity was shown to be completely abrogated by the co-repressor Hairless (Hr) (32Moraitis A.N. Giguère V. Thompson C.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6831-6841Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Hr is a nuclear protein that also mediates transrepression by thyroid hormone receptor and vitamin D receptor through the recruitment of histone deacetylases (40Potter G.B. Beaudoin III, G.M.J. DeRenzo C.L. Zarach J.M. Chen S.H. Thompson C.C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2687-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 41Hsieh J.C. Sisk J.M. Jurutka P.W. Haussler C.A. Slater S.A. Haussler M.R. Thompson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38665-38674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In contrast to the ubiquitous expression pattern and promiscuity of NCoR and SMRT, Hr expression is restricted to the skin and brain and is nuclear receptor-selective. We demonstrate in this study that the Ub-proteasome pathway regulates RORα-mediated gene transcription. We observed that the RORα protein expression level increases upon inhibition of the 26 S proteasome complex with the MG-132 peptide aldehyde. RORα degradation occurs following Ub conjugation, likely signaled by recruitment of co-factors to the activated receptor. Strikingly, we show that the Hr co-repressor protects RORα from degradation, a mechanism not shared by the co-repressor NCoR. Proteasomal inhibition is thus unfavorable to RORα transcriptional activity. Taken together, these results show that protection of RORα from the activity of the Ub-proteasome pathway by Hr is an integral component of RORα-regulated transcription. Plasmids—pCMX-hRORα1 wild type and ligand-binding domain mutants L361F, V364G, K357A, and E509K as well as pCMX-FLAG-hRORα1 have been previously described (32Moraitis A.N. Giguère V. Thompson C.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6831-6841Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). N-terminal deletion mutants of hRORα1, RORαΔN12, RORαΔN25, and RORαΔN35 have been described elsewhere (42Giguère V. McBroom L.D.B. Flock G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 2517-2526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pCMV-HA-Ub consists of a octameric Ub construct; each Ub is preceded at its N terminus by an HA tag as described in (43Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar).

Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Cos-1 cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing penicillin (25 units/ml), streptomycin (25 units/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Twenty-four hours prior to transfection, the cells were split and seeded in 12-well plates. The cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science), following the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. A total of 1 μg of DNA/well was transfected including 0.05 μg of pCMX-hRORα1 or mutant derivatives, 0.5 μg of pCMX-hNCoR or pRK5-Myc-rHR, 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid, and 0.25 μg of internal control pCMVβGal. The cells were treated with ethanol (vehicle) or 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 μm MG-132 for 6–24 h, as specified in the figure legends. The cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. The normalized values are expressed in terms of relative luciferase units. The error bars represent the standard deviations between duplicate samples. Each graph is one representative experiment of a total of three independent experiments. Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Assays—Cos-1 cells in 10-cm dishes were transiently transfected as described above with 10 μg of FLAG-RORα and HA-Ub and treated with ethanol (vehicle) or 1 μm MG-132 for 24 h. The cells were lysed in IP buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science). The lysates (containing a total of 250 μg of protein) were incubated with 5 μg of FLAG antibody (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The proteins were collected on protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C with mild rotation and then washed three times with ice-cold low salt buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a hydrophobic polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and immunoblotted with FLAG antibody or HA antibody (HA.11; Berkeley Antibody Company). The proteins were visualized with the POD chemiluminescence kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Immunoblotting for detection of RORα wild type and mutants, Myc-Hr, SRC-1, hNCoR, or actin was similarly done using anti-RORα antibody (C-16; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-c-Myc antibody (Roche Applied Science), anti-SRC-1 antibody (M-341; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-hNCoR antibody (H-303; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-actin antibody (I-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. The lysates were prepared from transiently transfected Cos-1 harvested in modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1mm NaF), resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred, and immunoblotted as described above. In Vitro Degradation Assay—The cell extract was prepared from Cos-1 cells harvested in modified RIPA buffer. 5 μlof in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled RORα, using TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI), was incubated with 50 μg of cell extract, ethanol (vehicle), or 50 μm MG-132, 20 μm lactacystin, 50 μg/ml expressed sequence tag, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in a final volume of 50 μl of degradation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol) for 2 h at 37 °C. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were fixed, treated with the fluorographic reagent Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed. Pulse-Chase Assay—Cos-1 cells in 10-cm dishes were transiently transfected as described above, with 5 μg of pCMX-hRORα1 and pRK5-Myc-rHr or pCMX-hSRC-1 for 24 h as specified in figure legends. The cells were washed carefully with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (-methionine/-cysteine) for 2 h, followed by the addition of [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml) for an additional 1 h. The cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and chased with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for the times indicated in the figure legends. The cells were harvested and lysed in IP buffer. 400 μg of lysate was immunoprecipitated with 5 μl of anti-RORα antibody (C-16; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle rotation, followed by incubation with 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose for an additional 30 min. The beads were then washed with low salt buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), followed by a wash in high salt buffer (500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 3 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were fixed and treated with fluorographic reagent, dried, and exposed. Quantification was performed using the Typhoon 8600 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). RORα, a Target of the Ub-Proteasome Complex—Nuclear receptors are short-lived proteins that are rapidly turned over by the Ub-proteasome complex. Using pulse-chase analysis, we first determined that the half-life of RORα in transiently transfected Cos-1 cells is ∼1.3 h (Fig. 1A). This rapid turnover is reminiscent of liganded nuclear receptors, which have a shorter half-life than their unliganded counterparts. We next investigated whether RORα degradation is mediated by the Ub-proteasome complex using pharmacological inhibitors. Peptide aldehydes (MG-132) or natural products (lactacystin) act as pseudosubstrates that become covalently linked to the 26 S proteasome and inactivate its chymotryptic and tryptic-like activities (45Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, RORα is not expressed endogenously in Cos-1 cells, although RORα expressed through transient transfection is detected by immunoblotting with anti-RORα antibody. Blocking of the 26 S proteosome with MG-132 leads to a substantial increase of RORα protein, suggesting that RORα is a likely substrate of the Ub-proteasome complex (Fig. 1B). We next used Cos-1 extract as a source of Ub-proteasome complex in an in vitro degradation assay to determine whether in vitro translated and labeled RORα is proteolytically degraded. Loss of labeled RORα was observed upon incubation with Cos-1 extracts, a process that was not observed with extracts obtained from Cos-1 cells previously treated with the inhibitor MG-132, indicating that RORα is degraded by the 26 S proteasome in vitro (Fig. 2A). In addition to MG-132, treatment with lactacystin, an irreversible specific inhibitor of the 20 S proteasome, also blocked RORα degradation as demonstrated by a marked increase in protein expression in comparison with the control sample (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the lysosomal-specific cysteine protease inhibitor expressed sequence tag, as well as the nonspecific serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, failed to stabilize RORα protein levels, providing further evidence that RORα is specifically degraded by the 26 S proteasome. Substrates destined for proteasomal degradation are tagged by covalent attachment of a macromolecular Ub chain. Co-immunoprecipitation of RORα and Ub resulted in the appearance of high molecular weight Ub-conjugated RORα complexes in cells treated with MG-132 (Fig. 2C). Given the absence of Ub-RORα complexes in untreated cells, Ub-tagged RORα is likely rapidly degraded by the 26 S proteasome under normal conditions (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2RORα is ubiquitinylated and degraded by the 26 S proteasome.A, in vitro degradation assay of in vitro translated and labeled RORα incubated with Cos-1 cell extracts treated with ethanol (-) or 50 μm MG-132 (+). The input (i) represents labeled RORα not subjected to the 37 °C incubation required for the degradation reaction. B, in vitro degradation assay of in vitro translated and labeled RORα incubated with Cos-1 extract in the presence of vehicle (ethanol), MG-132, lactacystin, expressed sequence tag (EST), or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) inhibitors as specified under “Experimental Procedures.” C, Cos-1 cells transiently transfected with HA-tagged Ub (HAUb) and FLAG-tagged RORα (Flag-RORα) treated with ethanol (-) or 1 μm MG-132 (+) for 16 h. The lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-FLAG antibody and immunoblotted (Blot) with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies as specified under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A Putative PEST Motif Is Not Involved in Degradation— Proteins targeted for degradation by the Ub-proteasome complex often contain a short hydrophilic stretch of at least 12 amino acids termed a PEST motif. A PEST region serves as a proteolytic signal leading to rapid destruction of the protein (46Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1949) Google Scholar, 47Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). We first used a PESTfind program () to identify putative PEST sequences in RORα. This algorithmic program scores the hydrophilicity in a range of -50 to +50, and scores above +5.0 are considered more probable PEST motif candidates. A putative PEST motif with a score of +6.88 was located in the N-terminal region of the protein (Fig. 3A). To determine the involvement of this putative PEST motif in signaling RORα degradation, we tested three N-terminal deletion mutants referred to as RORαΔ12, RORαΔ25, and RORαΔ35 (Fig. 3B). These constructs were transiently transfected in Cos-1 cells, and their transactivation potential was assessed on a RORE-driven reporter. All deletion proteins displayed potent transcriptional activity, which was inhibited by treatment of the cells with the MG-132 (Fig. 3B). Given that protein expression of RORαΔ25 is stabilized upon treatment with MG-132 (Fig. 3C), we have to conclude that deletion of the N-terminal PEST motif does not affect RORα degradation. Proteasomal Degradation Is an Integral Part of RORα Transactivation Potential—Ub-mediated degradation of nuclear receptors and other transcription factors is tightly coupled to their transactivation potential, providing the cell with a mechanism that protects it against possible deleterious prolonged periods of transcription at specific genes. In particular, it has been demonstrated that this pathway is imperative for a functional hormone-mediated transcriptional response"

We have investigated the effects of glucose concentration on the parasite development cycle as reflected by changes of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription. We showed that glucose starvation differentially affects transcriptional control of the rRNA genes by sharply repressing transcription from those loci involved with asexual development of the parasite while up-regulating transcription at those loci involved with sexual development of the parasite. Temperature change also effects regulation of transcription. We found that the effects of temperature and glucose were synergistic. We identified and compared the upstream region of the transcription start sites of each gene. These putative promoter structures are considerably different from one another and contain structures remarkably similar to rRNA control elements in other organisms.

The number of ribosomes present in a cell is directly related to its protein-synthesizing activity and size of the cell. The ribosomes may make up 45% of the dry weight of an actively growing cell; thus, control of the synthesis of the molecules that make up the ribosome (e.g. rRNA) is essential to balance the needs of the cell with its external environment. Control of growth and function of a cell by regulation of ribosome production is somewhat analogous to controlling a vehicle with accelerator and brakes. Speed has to be monitored and regulated in conjunction with driving conditions for the sake of both fuel efficiency and safety. Likewise, the organism must have the means to speed up, slow down, or remain constant developmentally in response to its changing environment. Any one of a variety of metabolic rates may have an adaptive advantage depending on the situation.Although Plasmodium is a eukaryote, its rRNA gene is unlike any other eukaryote. In most eukaryotes, the rRNA gene units are identical in sequence and tandem arrayed in large numbers. Plasmodium species are encoded by a small number of rRNA gene units that are physically separated in the genome and variable in sequence (1.Dame J.B. McCutchan T.F. Mol. Biochem.

Ho M. Adv. Parasitol. 1992; 31: 83-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). One can anticipate that some of the changes in transcriptional patterns will parallel changes in glucose concentrations, even in culture. Some changes will be effected as a direct result of glucose starvation. Other changes involved in developmental transitions may well involve glucose but require additional factors including temperature change (9.Fang J. McCutchan T.F.

The RNA for A1 and A2 primer extension is from blood-stage parasites cultured at 37 °C. The RNA for S1 primer extension is from gametocytes. The RNA for S2 primer extension is from blood-stage parasites cultured at 26 °C for 3 h. Gametocytes were chosen for S1 initiation site determination due to the abundance of S1 type rRNA in gametocyte stage (see “Results”). The blood-stage parasites cultured at 26 °C were chosen for S2 initiation site determination due to high transcription level of S2 at this temperature (9.Fang J. McCutchan T.F.

The primers for real-time PCR of four copies of rRNA are: A1, TTGGTATATGCAAAAATTAATATGTTT and TAATTCTATGAAAAGACATGGAACAC; A2, TTCGCTAATATTGGAAAATTCAG and CATTTGATGTTTTATTAATGTTATTATCTT; S1, CATCAATTGGCGTTGTCGTTT and AACGATTAAACACACTATCAC; and S2, TACGTACAAAGTACACACTTA and ATGAAAAACTCATATTACATATTC.Real-time PCR conditions for each gene was according to the Roche Applied Science protocol, except that the extension temperature was 60 °C (21.Su X.Z. Wu Y. Sifri C.D. Wellems T.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1574-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Specific cDNAs were quantified using a standard curve based on the known concentration of the plasmids that contained the same DNA fragment. The products were cloned into pCRII vector and sequenced. The sequences were as predicted.RESULTSCloning rRNA Gene Precursor and Promoter Regions—It has been shown that both A-type rRNA and S-type rRNA genes in P. falciparum have multiple copies and different loci properties (18.Rogers M.J. McConkey G.A. Li J. McCutchan T.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The sequences preceding two mature A-type rRNA genes (A1 and A2, GenBank™ accession numbers AF503871 and AF503870, respectively), and two mature S-type rRNA genes (S1 and S2, GenBank™ accession numbers, AF503869 and AF503868, respectively) were identified by inverse PCR. A schematic of each precursor is shown in Fig. 1; transcriptional patterns of each rRNA gene (rDNA) are described in “Characterization of Precursors and Promoters of rRNA Genes.” The sequence data obtained here are the same as those in the recently released Plasmodium data base (PlasmoDB www.plasmodb.org).Characterization of Precursors and Promoters of rRNA Genes—RNA from different blood-stage or low temperature-treated parasites was used as a template for mapping the initiation sites of different rRNA genes. The transcriptional start point for each of the four transcripts (Fig. 2A) was revealed by primer extension experiments and confirmed by 5′-RACE technique. Distances from the transcription starting points of each rRNA gene to the 5′-end of mature 18 S rRNA are: A1, 1145 bp; A2, 1042 bp; S1, 1184 bp; and S2, 1318 bp (Fig. 1). The full-length precursors of A1 and A2 rRNA contain a similar 530-nucleotide region preceding the mature 18 S rRNA, although the sequences upstream to this region are diverse. In contrast, the only homologous sequence relating S1 and S2 in the precursor is a 20-bp region immediately 5′ to the mature 18 S RNA sequence that is similar to the corresponding sequence in the A genes.Fig. 2Characterization of promoters of A1, A2, S1, and S2 rRNA genes.A, primer extension of A1, A2, S1, and S2. +1 indicates the initiation site.

No conserved sequences were found upstream to the S1 and S2 initiation sites. Surprisingly, the general structure of these A1 and A2 promoters is very similar to the rRNA gene promoter structure in Escherichia coli (22.Zacharias M. Theissen G. Bradaczek C. Wagner R. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 699-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23.de Boer H.A. Gilbert S.F. Nomura M. Cell. 1979; 17: 201-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Conserved sequences encoding the putative promoter are seen in A1 and A2. Two conserved boxes similar to the -10 and -35 regions of E. coli rRNA gene promoter were identified upstream to the A1 and A2 transcription start sites. The distance between these two boxes is 61 bp in A1 and 64 bp in A2. Two GC-rich regions of 20 bp each, similar to that in the E. coli rRNA gene promoter, were found just preceding the A1 and A2 transcription start site. The distances between the GC-rich regions and the second conserved box are 90 bp and 92 bp, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C). The fact that the P. falciparum genome is more than 80% AT makes these GC-rich boxes notable.Transcriptional Pattern of Different rRNA Genes—Sequence analysis of the rRNA precursors revealed polymorphisms 5′ to the mature 18 S rRNA gene in all copies in “Characterization of Precursors and Promoters of rRNA Genes.” Their existence allowed us to design experiments to specifically detect transcripts from each of the four genes. To establish a baseline, RNA from various stages of parasite development was purified, and different copies of A- and S-type rRNA were quantified by detecting the transient precursor region by real-time PCR (Fig. 3). The results showed, as expected, that genes A1 and A2 were the predominant forms in asexual parasites. Full-length transcripts encoded by S1 are dominant in gametocytes but decrease in relative amounts as the parasite develops through the mosquito stages. S2 transcripts, first seen in overwhelming amounts in oocysts, are the dominant gene product in sporozoites.Fig. 3Relative transcription level of different rRNA genes from various stages of parasite development. Copy number of the highest transcription of rRNA genes in each stage was ranked as 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Glucose Concentration and rRNA Gene Transcription—Transcriptional change as a result of glucose variation was measured at 37 °C. Aliquoted parasites were cultured at five glucose concentrations (2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.11 mg/ml) for 3 h. The normal glucose concentration in human sera ranges from 0.7 mg/ml to 1.3 mg/ml. 1 mg/ml represents the normal glucose concentration in human sera. Glucose concentration in severe malaria with hypoglycemia can be as low as 0.12 mg/ml (24.Das B.S. Satpathy S.K. Mohanty D. Mohanty S. Mishra S.K. Satapathy P.C. Patnaik J.K. Bose T.K. Trans. R. Soc.

We show that culture at the lowest glucose concentration (0.11 mg/ml) for 3 h does not affect parasite viability. Relative amounts of transcription from A1, A2, S1, and S2 genes were determined by real-time PCR (Fig. 4). Each experiment was performed on three independent occasions with different sample sources yielding consistent results. Transcription of A1 at 0.11 mg/ml glucose was decreased relative to the control (1 mg/ml) sample by more than 85% (Fig. 4A); transcription of A2 was decreased by 80% (Fig. 4B). No variation in transcriptional levels was observed for S1 (Fig. 4C). Transcription of S2 was found to increase as glucose level decreased (Fig. 4D).Fig. 4Transcription levels of A1, A2, S1, and S2 rRNA under different glucose concentrations.

Aliquoted parasites were separately cultured in control media containing 1 and 0.11 mg/ml glucose for 1, 2, and 3 h. Transcription of A1 and A2 decreased continually over time, whereas no changes were observed in S1. S2 transcription continued to increase as the starvation time increased (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Time curve of the effect of glucose starvation on transcription levels of A1, A2, S1, and S2 rRNA genes in asexual blood-stage parasites.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The viability of parasites under our starvation conditions was determined by recovery of A-type rRNA transcription. Blood-stage parasites were starved at 0.11 mg/ml for 3 h and then returned to 1 mg/ml glucose for another 3 h. Fig. 6 shows that the A gene transcription level fully recovered.Fig. 6Recovery of transcription of A-type rRNA genes in parasites subjected to glucose deprivation.

We analyzed the influence of glucose concentrations and temperature change alone and in combinations. The results are shown in Fig. 7. Cultured parasites at 26 °C for 3 h down-regulate the transcription level of A-type rRNAs (A1 and A2) close to 50%. Glucose starvation can down-regulate A1 and A2 transcription levels by 85 and 80%, respectively. The glucose starvation in combination with low temperature can further decrease the transcription of A1 to 90% and A2 to 84% (Fig. 7, A and B). The effect of the combination is too small to say anything about a cooperative effect. S1 is regulated differently than the other genes (Fig. 7C). Neither temperature nor glucose starvation have a significant effect the level of transcription.Fig. 7The synergistic effect of glucose starvation and low temperature on the transcription of A1, A2, S1, and S2 rRNA genes.

The glucose starvation alone can up-regulate S2 transcription by 50% whereas low temperature alone can increase S2 transcription 16-fold. Glucose starvation in combination with low temperature has a synergistic effect increasing S2 transcription by 49-fold (Fig. 7D) in what appears to be a collaborative association.DISCUSSIONDevelopmental transitions in eucaryotic microorganisms relating to glucose starvation have been extensively studied in yeast. In parallel with the situation in P. falciparum, when yeast encounters glucose starvation or nitrogen starvation, sexual development is triggered: the mating ratio of yeast increases, and the cells perform conjugation, meiosis, and sporulation (25.Okazaki N. Okazaki K. Watanabe Y. Kato-Hayashi M. Yamamoto M. Okayama H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Transmission of Plasmodium from vertebrate host to mosquito likewise involves development through the sexual cycle and meiosis. Changes in rRNA transcription levels are integral to the yeast transformation. We have investigated Plasmodium for similar responses. The transcription pattern of different copies of rRNA indicates that two copies of A-type rRNA have the same type of transcriptional regulation. S-type rRNA, however, is not one type but two with regard to transcriptional control; one is expressed in gameteocytes and the other in sporozoites. Dramatic sequence differences between the two copies of S-type genes occur in the 5.8 S and 28 S regions. The sequences now can be confirmed by the recently released P. falciparum genomic data base. The synergistic effects of glucose starvation and low temperature on down-regulation of A1 and A2 and up-regulation of S2 are consistent with this stage specific transcription characteristic. The gametocyte, like a bridge connecting asexual stage and sexual stage of parasite life, encounters both environments of vertebrate and insect. As a primarily expressed rRNA in gametocyte, S1 should not respond to the change of environmental factors dramatically.In all organisms, nutrients are primary regulators of signaling pathways that control transcription and translation (26.Biggar S.R. Crabtree G.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3167-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 27.Gorner W. Durchschlag E. Wolf J. Brown E.L. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Schuller C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 28.Forsberg H. Ljungdahl P.O. Curr. Genet. 2001; 40: 91-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Carbon and amino acids are basic nutrient sources for cellular organisms. They supply energy for metabolism. Organisms have distinct sensing and signaling pathways to regulate gene expression in response to the type and quantity of their energy sources. The change in transcriptional patterns of rRNA resulting from the low glucose concentrations indicates that the parasite changes its energy source when it transmitted from vertebrate to mosquito host. Actually, it has been proposed that amino acids are the main energy source of Trypanosoma brucei upon transition to its insect vector, whereas glucose is the main energy source of the blood stage parasite (29.Bayele H.K. Eisenthal R.S. Towner P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14217-14222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).With regard to the molecular mechanism of control over rRNA transcription in many multi-cellular eukaryotes, rRNA transcription is tightly controlled and can be either silenced or opened. The ratio of activating and inactivating rRNA genes is tissue-specific (30.Conconi A. Widmer R.M. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 753-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). It has been shown that silencing of rRNA genes is often methylation-dependent (31.Santoro R. Grummt I. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 719-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We tried to determine if the regulation of rRNA genes in P. falciparum is methylation-dependent by using methytransferase inhibitor, 5-azacytidine, which can inhibit the inactivation of rRNA genes in mouse cell. We were unable to detect a relationship between methylation and transcriptional regulation of rRNA gene in the parasite.There are a number of parallels with the type of control described here for P. falciparum with that initially described for E. coli and is referred to as the “stringent response.” Carbon source starvation or amino acid starvation in E. coli can cause the dramatic inhibition of the synthesis of rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA for ribosomal proteins as well as selective pattern changes in other mRNAs (10.Lamond A.I. Travers A.A. Cell. 1985; 41: 6-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The definition of a stringent response has been broadened to include organisms such as yeast (11.Warner J.R. Gorenstein C. Nature. 1978; 275: 338-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which also selectively reduce the transcription of ribosomal RNA and mRNAs of ribosomal protein in response to external signals such as amino acid starvation. Interestingly, it is now known that the stringent response in prokaryotes is dependent on the GC-rich region just preceding the initiation site of transcription (32.Travers A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 973-976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Zacharias M. Goringer H.U. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3357-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 34.Josaitis C.A. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1117-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The similar GC-rich sequences in the promoters of A-type rRNA genes in P. falciparum suggest that the reciprocal regulation of different types of ribosome RNA genes in P. falciparum under glucose starvation fits into this category. Identifying the specific proteins or enzymes involved would be beneficial to the development of new drug target. The number of ribosomes present in a cell is directly related to its protein-synthesizing activity and size of the cell. The ribosomes may make up 45% of the dry weight of an actively growing cell; thus, control of the synthesis of the molecules that make up the ribosome (e.g. rRNA) is essential to balance the needs of the cell with its external environment. Control of growth and function of a cell by regulation of ribosome production is somewhat analogous to controlling a vehicle with accelerator and brakes. Speed has to be monitored and regulated in conjunction with driving conditions for the sake of both fuel efficiency and safety. Likewise, the organism must have the means to speed up, slow down, or remain constant developmentally in response to its changing environment. Any one of a variety of metabolic rates may have an adaptive advantage depending on the situation. Although Plasmodium is a eukaryote, its rRNA gene is unlike any other eukaryote. In most eukaryotes, the rRNA gene units are identical in sequence and tandem arrayed in large numbers. Plasmodium species are encoded by a small number of rRNA gene units that are physically separated in the genome and variable in sequence (1.Dame J.B. McCutchan T.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1983; 8: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 2.Langsley G. Hyde J.E. Goman M. Scaife J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 8703-8717Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Transcription studies indicate that eventually all of the genes are expressed over the course of the developmental cycle (3.Gunderson J.H. Sogin M.L. Wollett G. Hollingdale M. de la Cruz V.F.

https://openalex.org/W2171107174,"Chorismate synthase (EC 4.2.3.5), the seventh enzyme in the shikimate pathway, catalyzes the transformation of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate (EPSP) to chorismate, which is the last common precursor in the biosynthesis of numerous aromatic compounds in bacteria, fungi, and plants. The chorismate synthase reaction involves a 1,4-trans-elimination of phosphoric acid from EPSP and has an absolute requirement for reduced FMN as a cofactor. We have determined the three-dimensional x-ray structure of the yeast chorismate synthase from selenomethionine-labeled crystals at 2.2-Å resolution. The structure shows a novel βαβα fold consisting of an alternate tight packing of two α-helical and two β-sheet layers, showing no resemblance to any documented protein structure. The molecule is arranged as a tight tetramer with D2 symmetry, in accordance with its quaternary structure in solution. Electron density is missing for 23% of the amino acids, spread over sequence regions that in the three-dimensional structure converge on the surface of the protein. Many totally conserved residues are contained within these regions, and they probably form a structured but mobile domain that closes over a cleft upon substrate binding and catalysis. This hypothesis is supported by previously published spectroscopic measurements implying that the enzyme undergoes considerable structural changes upon binding of both FMN and EPSP."

To further understand the regulation and roles of OKL38 in tumorigenesis we proceeded to clone and characterize the human OKL38 gene and three of its variants with transcripts of 1.9, 2.2, and 2.4 kb. The human OKL38 gene spans ∼18 kb and contains 8 exons and 7 introns with exon size ranging from 92 to 1270 bp. RT-PCR and sequence analysis suggest that different transcripts were arrived through differential promoter usage and alternate splicing. Multiple Tissue Expression array (MTE) and Multiple Tissue Northern blot (MTN) indicated that OKL38 was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues with high expression in liver, kidney, and testis. The cancer profiling array (CPA) of paired normal/tumor cDNA showed that OKL38 mRNA was down-regulated in 70% (14 of 20) of kidney tumors. Western analysis revealed that the OKL38 protein was undetectable in 78% (7 of 9 pairs) of kidney tumor tissues. Immunohistological analysis showed that 64% (14 of 22) of kidney tumors were either lost or underexpressed OKL38 protein compared with the adjacent normal tissue. A transfection study using OKL38-eGFP recombinant construct showed that overexpression of the 52 kDa OKL38 protein in A498 cells resulted in growth inhibition and cell death.

Campbell's Urology. 3. W. B. Saunders Co., New York1998: 2283-2326Google Scholar). The incidence of RCC is increasing, and it is estimated that RCC accounts for 95,000 deaths per year worldwide (2.Vogelzang N.J. Stadler W.M. Lancet. 1998; 352: 1691-1696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Complete surgical resection is considered to be the only effective treatment for patients with clinically localized RCC. However, the disease recurs postoperatively in 20-40% of patients who undergo potentially curative nephrectomy (1.Belldegrun A. deKernion J.B. Campbell's Urology. 3. W. B. Saunders Co., New York1998: 2283-2326Google Scholar). Accurate prediction of long term cancer-free survival immediately after resection of clinically localized diseases, therefore, will be valuable for planning follow-up protocols and for identifying patients with a high risk of recurrence and for patients who would benefit the most from adjuvant therapy. Although conventional prognosis factors such as pathologic tumor stage and grading are useful, other novel prognostic parameters, including clinical, laboratory, and biomolecular factors, will be needed to provide additional predictive value (3.Mejean A. Oudard S. Thiounn N. J. Urol. 2003; 169: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).OKL38 has previously been cloned and partially characterized in our laboratory as a pregnancy-induced growth inhibitory gene (4.Huynh H. Ng C.Y. Ong C.K. Lim K.B. Chan T.W. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3607-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This gene is ubiquitously expressed in all rat tissues with the highest levels detected in the ovary, kidney, and liver. OKL38 expression is increased during pregnancy and lactation in the rat mammary gland; however, low levels of OKL38 transcripts are observed in various human breast cancer cell lines and barely detectable in DMBA-induced rat mammary tumors. Transfection of MCF-7 cells with OKL38 cDNA resulted in growth inhibition in vitro and reduction in tumor formation in vivo, suggesting that OKL38 may play a vital role in the growth regulation and differentiation of breast epithelial cells during pregnancy and probably in tumorigenesis (4.Huynh H. Ng C.Y. Ong C.K. Lim K.B. Chan T.W. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3607-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which OKL38 exerts its role in growth inhibition and differentiation are still unknown.As a first step in understanding function and regulation, herein we report the cloning, sequencing, and genomic organization of the human OKL38 gene. Three novel OKL38 cDNAs were cloned and characterized. Because OKL38 has been implicated in tumorigenesis, we investigated the expression of OKL38 transcripts and protein in normal and tumor kidney. Beside growth and differentiation, the transfection study shows that OKL38 may also play an important role in cell death.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProbe Labeling—All probes used for library screening as well as for Southern and Northern blot analyses were radioactively labeled with [α-32P]deoxy-CTP (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) using the Rediprime II DNA Labeling System (Amersham Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a nucleotide purification kit (Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany).Screening, Subcloning, and Sequencing of the OKL38 Gene—Two cosmid clones containing human OKL38 gene were isolated from the human cosmid library (Clontech) using the previously reported human OKL38 cDNA (4.Huynh H.

Restriction digestion and Southern analysis were used to estimate the insert size and confirm their identity. Shotgun strategy was adopted to subclone the cosmid insert for sequencing. In brief, the cosmid clone was digested with various restriction enzymes, single or double digestion. The digested products were separated on an agarose gel and products of less than 6 kb were cloned into pBluescript®SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) vector with the subcloning map shown in Fig. 1A. Fragments with the expected size of the cosmid vector were excluded. The longer clones were fully sequenced by direct cosmid sequencing and using the Template Generation System™ (Finnzymes) as recommended by the manufacturer. The GenomeWalker™ kit (Clontech) was used to clone the missing 3′-end of the OKL38 gene using the GW-F forward primers (Table II) as described by the manufacturer. All the sequencing was performed using automated sequencing via dideoxy chain termination using the BigDye™ version 3.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All the regions were sequenced at least three times.Table IISequences of oligonucleotides used for RT-PCR primer, cloning, primer, sequencing primer, variant-specific primer, and 5′RACE primerOligonucleotideSequencePext15′-CTGCTGACCCTGACCTTGTTCTAGA-3′Pext3/GSP2R5′-GGTCAGGGGAACACGGATCACAGAGTCC-3′GSP1R/PCR-1R5′-CGTAGAAGGGCATCAAAGAGCAGGG-3′1F5′-AAGCTTGGATCCCCACAGGGTAATGGGTGT-3′1R5′-GAATTCTGGAAGGCGCAGGGCTGCAGGTCT-3′2F5′-AAGCTTGGCAGGGAGGAAAGTCCACGTCT-3′PCR-1R5′-CGTAGAAGGGCATCAAAGAGCAGGG-3′PCR-2F5′-GGGAAGTGGAGACTGAGAGGCTGCTGC-3′477-F5′-CACCATGAGCTCCTCCAGAAAGGACCA-3′477-eGFP-R5′-CTCGCCCTTGCTCACCATGGGTGGCTTCCTGGTCTC-3′eGFP-F5′-ATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG-3′eGFP-R5′-TTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCA-3′Seq1RaSequencing primer.5′-CTGGTCAGGAAGCCGCTCACCTGGAAGA-3′Seq2RaSequencing primer.5′-CAGTCTTCCTTGAAGCACAGCAGCTGGT-3′Seq3RaSequencing primer.5′-GATGGCGTGCTCCTTCCGGTGCTTCC-3′Seq4F/GW-FaSequencing primer.5′-GAGATGACCACATCCCTGCTGGATGC-3′Seq5FaSequencing primer.5′-GTGTTCAACCAGCTGCCCAAGATGC-3′P1F5′-CTGAGGAAGAGGGAGGCAAGAGACAGAG-3′P1R5′-GCTGATATGGGGAACTGTGGGGCGAGAC-3′V-1F5′-AGGCATCACCTCAGGCACAA-3′V-1R5′-CTGACAGGCAGTGGTGCAGGA-3′a Sequencing primer. Open table in a new tab Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) Analysis—To establish the full-length cDNA of human OKL38, 5′-RACE was performed using the SMART™ RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's direction with the following modification: The secondary PCR of the primary RACE products was performed using Advantage® Genomic polymerase (Clontech). The gene-specific primer, GSP1R (Table II) was designed based on the 5′-end sequence of the previously isolated human OKL38 cDNA (4.Huynh H. Ng C.Y. Ong C.K. Lim K.B. Chan T.W. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3607-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), while GSP2R was designed based on the 5′-end sequence of the GSP1R RACE fragment (Fig. 3). The RACE products were identified using Southern blot analysis and subsequently cloned into the pCR®-Blunt-II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced using T7 and SP6 primers. Sequence analysis was carried out using Laser gene sequence analysis software (Dnastar Inc.).Fig. 3Schematic illustration of 5′-RACE and primer extension analysis.A, the 1.6-kb cDNA has previously been cloned, which consists of only exons 6, 7, and 8. Gene-specific primer, GSP1R used in 5′-RACE experiment established exons 3, 4, and 5, while GSP2R established exon 1. Both reverse primers, Pext1 and Pext3 were designed for primer extension analysis. B, primer extension study performed using Li, liver; Ki, kidney; Pr, prostate mRNA as templates and reverse primer Pext3. The nucleotides G and T, indicate a major and a minor transcriptional start site, respectively. Note that Pext1 failed to obtain any extended product.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Primer Extension Study—2 μm32P-labeled primer (Pext1 on exon 1 and Pext3 on exon 3) (Table II) were allowed to hybridized with 200 ng of human liver, kidney, and prostate poly(A)+ mRNA (Clontech). The touchdown method was employed to increase the stringency of hybridization with the following parameter: 85 °C, 15 min; 84 °C, 90 s; -0.1 °C for every subsequent cycle to dock at a final temperature of 50 °C. The hybridization mix was added to the reverse transcription mix to a total volume of 100 μl containing 5× Superscript buffer, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 10 μm dNTP, 250 units of Superscript II enzyme (Invitrogen), Rnasin (Promega, Madison, WI), DEPC-H2O, and followed by extension for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by heating to 70 °C for 15 min, ethanol-precipitated, dried, redissolved in formamide-dye mix, and run on a 6% denaturing gel. The fmol™ cycle sequencing kit (Promega) was used to generate a DNA ladder with subclone P-3.4 and S-5.5 (Fig. 1A) as template, and Pext1 and Pext3 as primers, respectively.Cloning cDNA of HuOKL38-1a, -2a, and -2b cDNAs via PCR—Cloning of the full-length cDNA of the HuOKL38-1a transcript was achieved using two PCR primers, forward primer 1F (nucleotide positions 7-33) designed at the 5′-end and reverse primer 1R (nucleotide positions 1863-1889) (Table II) designed at the 3′-end of the HuOKL38-1a cDNA. To clone the HuOKL38-2a and -2b cDNAs, forward primer 2F (nucleotide positions 52-75 of the -2a transcript) (Table II) was used instead of the 1F primer (Fig. 3A). In all cases, the forward primer carried a HindIII and the reverse primer an EcoRI restriction site for directional cloning. To generate the cDNA template for PCR cloning, 1 μg of human liver mRNA was reversed-transcribed using SuperScript™II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. The template was amplified by PCR under the following conditions: denaturation step at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min and 30 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products of the correct size were cloned into pBluescript®SK (Stratagene) for sequencing.In Vitro Transcription and Translation (TNT) Study—To verify the predicted molecular weight of the putative ORF of OKL38, the TnT®-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) was used to transcribe and translate the HuOKL38-1a, -2a, -2b and the previously cloned 1.6-kb cDNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cloned cDNAs in pBluescript®SK (Stratagene) were digested with EcoRI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and purified twice by phenol/chloroform extraction. The DNA was precipitated with ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in H2O. 1 μg of the digested plasmid was used for the TnT reaction. The synthesized protein was labeled with l-[35S]methionine (ICN), and 5 μl of the reaction were loaded and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE. The synthesized protein was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and exposed to film. To confirm the identity of the in vitro synthesized protein, Western blot analysis was performed on the TnT products using rabbit anti-OKL38 antibody.Multiple Tissues Expression (MTE) Array, Northern Blot Analysis, and Cancer Profiling Array (CPA)—The MTE and CPA were purchased from Clontech and the human Northern blots were from Invitrogen. Both the arrays and blots were hybridized with a 700-bp SmaI human OKL38 probe (936-1685 nt of HuOKL38-1a) that detects all different variants. Ubiquitin (provided by the manufacturer) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were used for normalizing arrays and Northern blots, respectively. Pre-hybridization of the arrays and blots were performed at 50 °C for 1 h in ExpressHyb™ (Clontech) with sheared salmon testis DNA added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The denatured radiolabeled probe was mixed directly into the pre-hybridization solution and hybridized overnight at 50 °C. After hybridization, the arrays were washed three times at 55 °C in solution 1 (2× SSC, 0.5% SDS) for 30 min each time, repeated with solution 2 (0.2× SSC, 0.5% SDS), and a final rinse in 2× SSC at room temperature. Blots were exposed to a phosphorimager overnight. For the Northern blot analysis, washing was performed at 45 °C using solutions 1 and 2. mRNA levels were determined by densitometric scanning of autoradiographs and normalized to the level of GAPDH.Semi-quantitative RT-PCR of OKL38 Variants—1 μg of total mRNA was used as template for One Step RT-PCR (Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany) adopting the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. To study the expression of the HuOKL38-1a transcript, variant-specific forward primer PCR-1F (nucleotide positions 1-28) and a common reverse primer PCR-1R (nucleotide positions 339-443 of HuOKL38-1a) (Table II) were designed for RT-PCR. To determine the expression of HuOKL38-2a, -2b, and -2c transcripts, RT-PCR was performed using the forward primer PCR-2F (nucleotide positions 387-413) and reverse primer PCR-1R (Table II). The specificity of the designed primers and PCR conditions were optimized using the three cloned cDNAs, HuOKL38-1a, -2a, and -2b as templates. A pair of tubulin primers, TubF (5′-AACGTCAAGACGGCCGTGT-3′) and TubR (5′-GACAGAGGCAAACTGAGCAC-3′), which amplify a 400-bp fragment of tubulin cDNA, was used for normalization. The One Step RT-PCR was performed as follows: 50 °C for 30 min; 95 °C for 15 min; followed by 38 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The amplified products were separated on a 2.0% agarose gel.Patients and Tissue Samples—Tissue samples were obtained intra-operatively from tumors and adjacent non-tumor kidney tissues during resection for kidney tumor at the Singapore General Hospital. The samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until analysis. A similar set of samples was fixed in 10% formalin and paraffin-embedded. Prior written informed consent was obtained from all patients, and the study received ethics board approval at the National Cancer Centre of Singapore as well as the Singapore General Hospital.OKL38 Antibody and Western Blot Analysis—Rabbit polyclonal OKL38 antibody was raised against the OKL38-specific peptide: CAVEWGTPDPSSCGAQ (amino acid positions 200-214). Affinity-purified rabbit anti-human OKL38 antibody was diluted in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 20 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.6) containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. Western analysis was performed by incubating the blots with 1:2000 anti-OKL38 antibody or anti-OKL38 antibody preadsorbed with 50× antigen peptide (control for antibody specificity) overnight at 4 °C and washed three times with TBST, 15 min each. Subsequently, the blots were incubated with 1:7500 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 h. After washing three times with TBST, 15 min each, the blots were then visualized with a chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer.Immunohistochemical Analysis—5-μm thick sections were cut, dewaxed in xylene, and then rehydrated as described (5.Huynh H. Chow P.K. Ooi L.L. Soo K.C. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 115-122PubMed Google Scholar). Antigen retrival was performed by boiling the slides in 10 mm citrate buffer pH 6.0 for 20 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min. After two washes of TBS, the sections were preincubated with 5% skim milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 for 15 min to reduce nonspecific background staining. The section were washed twice with TBST for 5 min and incubated overnight at 4 °C, with purified primary antisera against human OKL38 or antisera preadsorbed with 50× antigen peptide to serve as a control for antibody specificity. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the streptavidin-biotin peroxidase complex method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Lab Vision, Fremont, CA) using AEC as the chromogen.Generating OKL38-eGFP-pcDNA3.0 Construct—The HuOKL38-1a cDNA contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 477 amino acids. To fuse this OKL38 protein to the eGFP via PCR, 4 primers namely 477-F, 477-eGFP-R, eGFP-F, and eGFP-R (Table II) were designed. Two separate PCR reactions were performed using the primer 477-F and 477-eGFP-R to amplify the ORF of OKL38 and primers eGFP-F and eGFP-R to amplify the ORF of eGFP. The amplified products from the two PCR reactions were then mixed and reamplified using primers 477-F and eGFP-R. The PCR reaction was performed as follows: 95 °C for 5 min; followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, and final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The recombinant products were cloned into pCR®-Blunt-II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), screened for orientation and subsequently cloned into pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen) mammalian expression vector. The OKL38-eGFP-pcDNA3.0 construct was fully sequenced, and endotoxin-free plasmid for transfection was prepared using the Maxi-prep kit (Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The positive control eGFP-pcDNA3.0 was constructed with the same strategy using only the eGFP-F and eGFP-R primers for PCR cloning.Cell Culture and Transfection—Human kidney cancer A498 cells were maintained as monolayer cultures at 37 °C (5% CO2) in α-modified Eagle's medium (α-MEM) plus phenol red, supplement with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin, and streptomycin (Invitrogen). A498 cells were seeded at 2 × 105 in 100-mm culture dishes containing a coverslip, swabbed with ethanol, and grown to 70% confluence prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with 10 μg of either eGFP-pcDNA3.0 or OKL38-eGFP-pcDNA3.0 plasmid DNA and 12 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Each coverslip was removed at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h post-transfection using a sterile forceps. The coverslip with cells was fixed with 10% formalin, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and mounted onto a slide for observation using a microscope (Olympus) equipped with epifluorescence optics and appropriate filters for fluorescein isothiocyanate.Computational Analysis—Sequence identity and ORF prediction were done using analysis software from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The ClustalW v1.82 program (EMBL) was used to perform the multiple sequence alignment. The predicted amino acid sequences were analyzed using: (i) cPfam CDS-Conserved Domain Search (NCBI) for conserved domain detection and (ii) SignalP (6.Nielsen H. Krogh A. Prediction of Signal Peptides and Signal Anchors by a Hidden Markov Model.in: Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Systemsfor Molecular Biology (ISMB 6)TMpred. AAAI Press, Menlo Park1998Google Scholar) for analyzing the presence of signal peptide. The putative promoter region was analyzed using the MatInspector V2.2 (transfac.gbf.de/cgi-bin/matSearch/matsearch.pl), CpG Island Searcher (www.uscnorris.com/cpgislands/cpg.cgi) and Repeat Masker (ftp.genome.washington.edu/RM/RepeatMasker.html).RESULTSCloning, Sequencing, Genomic Organization, and Sequence Analysis of the Human OKL38 Gene—Two cosmid clones containing the human OKL38 gene were isolated with the longer clone containing an insert of ∼35 kb. Both clones contained the OKL38 gene as determined by Southern blotting and sequencing. Direct cosmid sequencing of the insert ends indicate that ∼100 bp were missing from the 3′-end of OKL38 exon 8. A 2.5-kb fragment containing this missing end was cloned using the GenomeWalker™ kit. The cloning map was shown in Fig. 1A. The sequence information was deposited in GenBank™ with the accession number AF334780.Comparing the sequenced genomic clone with the sequences of the cloned cDNAs, the exon/intron junctions of the OKL38 gene were identified. Each of the 5′-donor and 3′-acceptor splice sites conformed to the consensus sequences with the highly conserved, invariable GT/AG dinucleotides present at the immediate exon/intron boundaries (Table I). The human OKL38 gene spanned a genomic region of ∼18 kb and contains 8 exons with sizes ranging from 92 to 1270 bp (Fig. 1B).Table IExon intron junctions of OKL38 geneExon no.Exon size5′ Splice donorIntron size3′ Splice acceptorbpbp1440CAGACAAGAGgtacgtcggc1599ccctctgtagGTTCCTGCTA2160CAGGACGAGGgtgaggaggg∼2500atccccacagGGTAATGGGT3109TGCCTGTCAGgtgagtgtcc4270cccactccagGTCCGCTGCC499ATCATTGTGGgtgagtgtca1521ctctccccagGTAACGGCCC5137CCTGGACCAGgtgggtcagc1172ccccctccagGACCTGGACT6192AGCCTGGCACgtgagtgggg220ttccctgcagTCCATCGAAG792AGAAGCGAAGgtgaggccgc3990tccccaacagAGGTCTTCGC81270 Open table in a new tab In the process of sequencing, an ∼850 bp CCCT-rich region residing in the subclone Bs/X-1.1 (Fig. 1A), of which 300 bp could not be sequenced even after the SequenceRx enhancer solution F (Invitrogen) had been used, was identified. This region was part of the intron 2, located 1.2-kb upstream of the promoter P1 transcriptional start site (Fig. 2A). Another interesting region spanning ∼500 bp was identified with the Repeat Masker program as simple CA repeats. Careful investigation showed that this region contained 11 alternate repeats of 26 and 28 nucleotides, interrupted by three conserved 26-nucleotide repeats. These repeats could be arranged to form four long repeats with repeats 2 and 3, each 160 bp, aligned perfectly, while 1 and 4 are partly conserved. This region contained ∼70% cytosine and adenine, and was localized 140-bp upstream of exon 2 (Fig. 2A). The functional significance of these unique regions is unknown at the present time.Fig. 2Sequence comparison and analysis of the OKL38 gene.A, detailed map of the first four exons of the human OKL38 gene. The distance between two putative promoters, and the distance between promoter P1 and the CCCT repeats are shown. Arrows pointing down indicate transcriptional start site. P1 and P2 indicate the positions of putative promoter 1 and 2, respectively. Note that the transcription start site is located 22-bp upstream of the exon 3 splice junction. B, our sequenced OKL38 gene showed two different regions when compared with that published by the human genome sequencing project. A longer CCCT repeat region and a deletion of 20 bp of the CA repeats are shown. Primers V-1F and V-1R were designed to verify the presence of longer CCCT repeats in our sequenced OKL38 gene.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)BLAST analysis performed using the present sequence data against the published draft human sequence (Genomic contig: NT_024797.13) (NCBI) revealed that the OKL38 gene was localized to chromosome 16 (16q23.3), which was prone to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in a variety of tumors (7.Latil A.

Cancer. 1999; 80: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Comparing our sequenced OKL38 gene with the published human genome using ClustalW delineated two different regions. A ∼20-bp random deletion in the CA repeats region and a 550-bp longer CCCT-rich region were observed in our sequenced OKL38 gene (Fig. 2B). To verify the presence of this longer CCCT-rich region in our cosmid clone, PCR was performed using a forward primer, V1-F, which resides immediately downstream of exon 2 and reverse primer, V1-R, which resides in exon 3. A PCR product of ∼2.5 kb was synthesized instead of a 1.95-kb fragment, suggesting that the 850 bp CCCT-rich region in our clone is not an artifact of cloning. These differences suggest regions of DNA instability.Sequence Analysis of the Two Putative Promoter Regions—Two putative promoters were identified while comparing the 5′-RACE fragments with the cloned OKL38 genomic sequence (Fig. 2A). Analyzing the proximal 300-bp region upstream of promoter P1 using the MatInspector program identified several potential sites for the Ikaros factor (IK2), homeodomain factor Nkx-2.5/Csx (NKX25), upstream stimulating factors (USF), myeloid zinc finger protein (MZF1), Sp1, and AP-1, -2, and -4. Using the CpG Island Searcher (lower limit values of 200 bp for length, 55% for GC content, and 0.65 for observed CpG/expected CpG ratio), a CpG island of 215 bp located 746-bp upstream of the promoter P1 transcriptional start site was identified. No TATA or CAAT boxes were observed upstream of this initiation site. However, an alternative core promoter motif called the initiator (Inr) (11.Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), which encompasses the initiation site, was identified. Interestingly, the sequence around this start site, TCAGAGC matched the Inr consensus sequences except for the penultimate G, indicating that this core sequence is likely responsible for driving transcription from this site. In support of the presence of the Inr, a putative downstream promoter element (DPE) at positions +27 to + 33 was identified (11.Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell."
https://openalex.org/W2128394438,"The mechanisms by which growth factors trigger signal transduction pathways leading to protection against apoptosis are of great interest. In this study, we investigated the effect of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF/SF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on adriamycin (ADR)-induced apoptosis. Treatment of human epithelial MKN74 cells with ADR, a DNA topoisomerase IIα inhibitor, caused apoptosis. However, cells pretreated with HGF/SF, but not those pretreated with EGF, were resistant to this apoptosis. The protective effect of HGF/SF against the ADR-induced apoptosis was abolished in the presence of either LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3′-OH kinase (PI3-K) or 1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate, an inhibitor of Akt, thus implicating the activation of PI3-K-Akt signaling in the antiapoptotic action of HGF/SF. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that HGF/SF stimulated the sustained phosphorylation of Akt for several hours but that EGF stimulated the phosphorylation only transiently. Furthermore, ADR-induced activation of caspase-9, a downstream molecule of Akt, was inhibited for at least 24 h after HGF/SF stimulation, but it was not affected by EGF stimulation. Cell-surface biotin-labeling analysis showed that the HGF/SF receptor remained on the cell surface until at least 30 min after HGF/SF addition but that the EGF receptor level on the cell surface was attenuated at an earlier time after EGF addition. These results indicate that HGF/SF, but not EGF, transmitted protective signals against ADR-induced apoptosis by causing sustained activation of the PI3-K-Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, the difference in antiapoptotic capacity between HGF/SF and EGF is explained, at least in part, by the delayed down-regulation of the HGF/SF receptor.

Chemotherapy for the treatment of cancer was introduced into the clinic more than 50 years ago. Recently, apoptosis has been shown to represent the cytotoxic endpoint for many chemotherapeutic drugs. The intracellular machinery responsible for apoptosis depends on a family of cysteine aspases (caspases), and the two main apoptotic pathways, the death receptor and mitochondrial pathways, are activated by caspase-8 and caspase-9, respectively. Apoptotic triggers such as chemotherapeutic drugs activate the latter pathway, which requires disruption of the mitochondrial membrane and the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Cytochrome c functions with Apf-1 to induce activation of caspase-9, thereby activating a set of caspases (1.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X.

Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar).

In this study, we found that doxorubicin (Adriamycin; ADR)-induced apoptosis of MKN74 cells was significantly inhibited by HGF/SF but was not changed by EGF. HGF/SF induced sustained activation of survival signals of PI3-K and Akt in MKN74 cells. It also inhibited ADR-induced caspase-9 activation in an Akt-dependent manner. Because caspase-9 is intimately associated with the initiation of apoptosis, HGF/SF seems to exert protective action against ADR-induced apoptosis by stimulating caspase-9 activity via the PI3-K-Akt survival signaling pathway. On the other hand, EGF also activated survival signals of PI3-K and Akt, but its effects on PI3-K and Akt were transient. Furthermore, EGF had no effect on ADR-induced caspase-9 activation. These results suggest that the long-lasting activation of PI3-K and Akt is critical for the protective action of growth factors against ADR. Because the resistance to apoptosis is a major cause of failure of treatment for malignancies, the PI3-K/Akt survival signaling pathway is a promising target for drug design in the treatment of several types of human cancer.

Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate was purchased from Matreya Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA). Cell Cultures—Human gastric adenocarcinoma MKN74 cells were cultured to subconfluence in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS and used for all of the experiments. Treatment of Cells with ADR—For most experiments, subconfluent cultures in 60- or 100-mm dishes were preincubated with or without 100 ng/ml of HGF/SF or EGF for 48 h and then treated with 20 μm ADR for 2 h. After exposure to the ADR, the cultures were washed twice to remove the drug and then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FCS. Cells were then harvested for assays of DNA fragmentation or for immunoblotting. DNA Fragmentation Assays—The DNA fragmentation assay was performed as described previously (53.Herrmann M. Lorenz H.M. Voll R. Grunke M. Woith W. Kalden J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5506-5507Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the indicated times of treatment with ADR, adherent cells and floating cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. DNA was extracted and purified from the pellet by use of IsoQuick (ORCA Research Inc., Bothell WA), and it was dissolved in gel loading buffer and then analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. For visualization of “DNA ladders,” the electrophoresed gel was soaked in Tris-borate/EDTA solution containing 0.1 mg/ml ethidium bromide. Preparation of Cellular Lysates and Immunoblotting—Cells were seeded at a density of 1.6 × 105 cells/35-mm dish and cultured for 2 days. The cells were washed with buffer A (25 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 135 mm NaCl) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml p-toluenesulfonyl-l-arginine methyl ester). Subsequently, the cells were lysed with Laemmli SDS sample buffer (54.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Total cellular lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membranes were sequentially incubated, first with primary antibody for 2 h and then with HRP-conjugated species-specific Ig for 1 h; the samples were subsequently developed with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to autoradiography film (X-Omat Blue XB-1; PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). Immunoprecipitation—MKN74 cells were seeded at 9.6 × 105 cells/100-mm dish and incubated in RPMI 1640 medium/5% FCS for 3 days. The cultures were treated with either HGF/SF or EGF for defined times at 37 °C and washed with buffer A containing a mixture of protease inhibitors. Subsequently, the cells were lysed in buffer B (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml p-toluenesulfonyl-l-arginine methyl ester, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 30 mm Na4P2O7). The lysates were then incubated on ice for 30 min and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fractions were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20), anti-Gab1 antibody, or anti-c-Cbl antibody. Immune complexes were collected on ProteinG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Bound proteins were washed five times with buffer B and eluted in Laemmli SDS sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol. Eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described above. PI3-K Activity Assay—PI3-K activity was examined according to the method of Tanimura et al. (39.Tanimura S. Chatani Y. Hoshino R. Sato M. Watanabe S. Kataoka T. Nakamura T. Kohno M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, MKN74 cells were seeded at a density of 9.6 × 105 cells/100-mm dish and incubated in RPMI 1640 medium/5% FCS for 3 days. The cultures were then pretreated or not with 10 μm LY294002 (LY) for 90 min and stimulated with HGF/SF for various times at 37 °C. Immunoprecipitates prepared from cell lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) were incubated in an assay mixture containing 40 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (Sigma), 0.2 mm phosphatidylserine (Avanti Polar-Lipids, Inc.), 50 μm ATP, 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences) and resolved by thin layer chromatography in CHCl3/methanol/acetone/acetic acid/H2O (7:5:2:2:2). Akt Activity Assay—Akt activity was examined according to the instruction manual of the Akt kinase assay kit used (New England Biolabs. Inc.). Briefly, MKN74 cells were pretreated or not with Akt inhibitor for 3 h, stimulated with HGF/SF for 5, 15, and 30 min, and washed with buffer A containing a mixture of protease inhibitors. Subsequently, the cells were lysed in buffer C (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fractions were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with a slurry of immobilized anti-Akt antibody. The immune complexes were washed twice with buffer C and equilibrated with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm MgCl2,); then, a kinase reaction mixture containing 200 μm ATP and 1 μg of GSK-3 fusion protein was added to the equilibrated immune complexes. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of Laemmli SDS sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-GSK-3α/β antibody. Surface Labeling—Cells were seeded at a density of 9.6 × 105 cells/100-mm dish and cultured for 2 days. They were then washed with buffer A containing a mixture of protease inhibitors and next washed with buffer D (100 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl). Subsequently, the cells were shaken gently with sulfo-NHS-biotin (0.2 mg/ml) in buffer D for 90 min at 4 °C. After the cells had been washed three times with RPMI 1640 medium and lysed in buffer B, the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HGF/SF receptor antibody or anti-EGF receptor antibody as described above. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membranes were subsequently incubated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, and the samples were then developed with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to autoradiography film (X-Omat Blue XB-1; PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). Initially, we evaluated the abilities of HGF/SF and EGF to rescue MKN74 cells from apoptosis induced by the DNA-damaging agent ADR. Pretreatment of the cells with 100 ng/ml HGF/SF for 48 h markedly suppressed the cell death induced by ADR, whereas 100 ng/ml EGF pretreatment had no effect on the cell death (Fig. 1A). Next, to evaluate whether this ADR-induced cell death resulted from apoptosis, we looked for DNA fragmentation after exposing the cells to 20 μm ADR for different times. As illustrated in Fig. 1B, ADR induced DNA fragmentation, and this fragmentation became apparent at an early time (3 h) after the addition of the drug. Pretreatment with HGF/SF, but not EGF, markedly protected the cells against DNA fragmentation induced by ADR treatment for 3, 6, 12, or 24 h. This protective action of HGF/SF against ADR was dose- and time-dependent, and maximal protection required pretreatment with 100 ng/ml of HGF/SF for 48 h (data not shown). Therefore, cells were pretreated in this fashion in subsequent experiments. The requirement of prolonged pretreatment with HGF/SF for protection against apoptosis suggests that maximal protection may require new protein synthesis. Several recent studies indicate that certain growth factors can suppress apoptosis through modulating the process of apoptosis (55.Resnicoff M. Abraham D. Yutanawiboonchai W. Rotman H.L. Kajstura J. Rubin R. Zoltick P. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2463-2469PubMed Google Scholar, 56.Friedlander R.M. Gagliardini V. Rotello R.J. Yuan J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Thus, we determined the effect of HGF/SF and EGF on the levels of key anti-apoptotic proteins (i.e. Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL). As shown in Fig. 2, ADR increased the expression of the Bcl-2 protein, and pretreatment with HGF/SF or EGF had no effect on the ADR-induced Bcl-2 expression. As for the Bcl-XL protein, another antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, ADR did not change its level irrespective of the presence or absence of HGF/SF or EGF. HGF/SF binding to its cognate receptor results in receptor activation and autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues, which then leads to activation of the PI3-K-dependent signaling pathway and the Ras-MAP kinase cascade. To determine a causal link between the activation of PI3-K and the antiapoptotic action of HGF/SF, we tested the effect of LY294002 (LY), a selective PI3-K enzyme inhibitor, on the protective action of HGF/SF. Cells were preincubated with 10 μm LY for 90 min before HGF/SF treatment, which was followed by exposure to ADR and postincubation as usual. LY had no significant effect on cell viability in control or ADR-treated cells, but it reduced the degree of HGF/SF-mediated protection against ADR (Fig. 3A). In contrast to LY, the MAP kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 did not significantly alter the ability of HGF/SF to protect against the ADR effect. This conclusion was confirmed by the findings that the protective action of HGF/SF against ADR-induced DNA fragmentation was inhibited by LY but not by PD98059 (Fig. 3B). We next determined whether LY actually blocked PI3-K activity in a specific manner. As shown in Fig. 3C, when the cells were stimulated with HGF/SF for 3 or 10 min, increased incorporation of 32P into the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate was observed. However, the PI3-K activation was not detectable in LY-pretreated cells. On the other hand, LY did not significantly alter HGF/SF-stimulated phosphorylation of MAP kinase (Fig. 3D). These findings indicate that HGF/SF-induced protection is caused, at least in part, by activation of PI3-K. To address the mechanism by which HGF/SF, but not EGF, increased cell survival against ADR-induced apoptosis of MKN74 cells, we analyzed PI3-K activity and signaling pathways downstream of PI3-K in HGF/SF- and EGF-treated cells. Cells were treated with either HGF/SF or EGF, and cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and then used for immunoblot analysis of the regulatory subunit of PI3-K. As shown in Fig. 4, HGF/SF stimulated intensively tyrosine phosphorylation of the subunit, which level was sustained for at least 60 min. In contrast, EGF induced transient tyrosine phosphorylation of PI3-K, and its level was lower. We next examined the activation of Akt by these growth factors. Akt is a protein kinase downstream of PI3-K that has been implicated in growth factor signaling related to cell survival (57.Kennedy S.G. Kandel E.S. Cross T.K. Hay N. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 5800-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 58.Kennedy S.G. Wagner A.J. Conzen S.D. Jordan J. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P.N. Hay N.

Cells were incubated in the presence of HGF/SF or EGF for several periods of time, and cell lysates were prepared from these cells to determine the phosphorylation of Akt by immunoblotting (Fig. 5A). Increased phosphorylation of Akt on serine 473 and threonine 308 became evident 15 min after HGF/SF addition, and sustained phosphorylation of both residues was observed up to about 6 h. In EGF-treated cells, the phosphorylation level on both residues in Akt reached maximum earlier (2 min) and then rapidly declined to the unstimulated level. Fig. 5B shows that the HGF/SF-induced phosphorylation of Akt was inh"

However, this study has shown that factor Xa-induced mitogenesis of rat aortic smooth muscle cell is independent of platelet-derived growth factor. We also could not observe any platelet-derived growth factor isoforms in the cultured medium of factor Xa-stimulated cells. Our finding that the cultured medium of factor Xa-stimulated cells strongly induces rat aortic smooth muscle cell mitogenesis in the absence of factor Xa activity led us to explore the existence of a novel autocrine pathway. The autocrine growth factor was purified from the cultured medium and was identified to be epiregulin. Recombinant epiregulin was also able to induce the mitogenesis. The secretion of epiregulin from factor Xa-stimulated rat aortic smooth muscle cell required mRNA expression and protein synthesis of the growth factor. The mitogenic effect of factor Xa on rat aortic smooth muscle cell was significantly reduced by anti-epiregulin antibody or by antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to epiregulin. Several lines of experimental evidence clearly indicate that the autocrine production of epiregulin, an epidermal growth factor-related ligand, is induced in the factor Xa-stimulated mitogenic process of rat aortic smooth muscle cell. Factor Xa has been reported to elicit smooth muscle cell proliferation via autocrine release of platelet-derived growth factor. However, this study has shown that factor Xa-induced mitogenesis of rat aortic smooth muscle cell is independent of platelet-derived growth factor.

Our finding that the cultured medium of factor Xa-stimulated cells strongly induces rat aortic smooth muscle cell mitogenesis in the absence of factor Xa activity led us to explore the existence of a novel autocrine pathway. The autocrine growth factor was purified from the cultured medium and was identified to be epiregulin. Recombinant epiregulin was also able to induce the mitogenesis. The secretion of epiregulin from factor Xa-stimulated rat aortic smooth muscle cell required mRNA expression and protein synthesis of the growth factor. The mitogenic effect of factor Xa on rat aortic smooth muscle cell was significantly reduced by anti-epiregulin antibody or by antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to epiregulin. Several lines of experimental evidence clearly indicate that the autocrine production of epiregulin, an epidermal growth factor-related ligand, is induced in the factor Xa-stimulated mitogenic process of rat aortic smooth muscle cell. Vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC)1 migration and proliferation are necessary events that contribute to the formation of neointimal hyperplasia in atherosclerosis, restenosis, and venous bypass graft disease (1Luscher T.F.

Although some aspects of the effect of factor Xa on aortic SMCs through PDGF have been investigated (25Ko F.N. Yang Y.C. Huang S.C. Ou J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1493-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26Herbert J. Bono F. Herault J. Avril C. Dol F. Mares A. Schaeffer P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the PDGF isoform that mediates factor Xa-induced SMC mitogenesis has not been identified yet. Moreover, no information is available about any particular autocrine production that is associated with factor Xa-induced SMC mitogenesis. In this work we have demonstrated that factor Xa-induced mitogenesis of rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) is independent of PDGF. More importantly, we have identified epiregulin as the major element responsible for factor Xa-induced RASMC mitogenesis. It was also revealed that autocrine production of epiregulin is essential in the mitogenesis. Epiregulin is the newest member of the family of EGF-like ligands, and it was first identified from the cultured medium of mouse fibroblast-derived tumor cell line NIH3T3/clone T7 (29Toyoda H.

It was subsequently shown that epiregulin acts as a mitogen for various cell types, including fibroblasts, aortic SMCs, hepatocytes (29Toyoda H. Komurasaki T. Uchida D. Takayama Y. Isobe T.

Epiregulin was also purified from the cultured medium of angiotensin II-stimulated RASMCs and was identified to be a major mitogenic constituent (32Taylor D.S. Cheng X. Pawlowski J.E. Wallace A.R.

PCR primers and phosphorothiolated oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) were synthesized from Genotech, Inc. (Korea). All other reagents were of the highest commercial purity. Cell Culture—RASMCs were isolated by a modification of the method of Chamley-Campbell et al. (33Chamley-Campbell J.H. Campbell G.R. Ross R. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 1-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). The thoracic aortas from 6–8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were removed and transferred onto ice in serum-free DMEM containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The aorta was incubated in 5 ml of the enzyme mixture containing DMEM with 1 mg/ml collagenase type 1 and 0.5 mg/ml elastase for 30 min at 37 °C. Then the aorta was transferred into DMEM with 2% FBS, and the adventitia were stripped off under a binocular microscope. The aorta was then transferred into a plastic tube containing 5 ml of the enzyme dissociation mixture and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The suspension was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in DMEM with 10% FBS. RASMCs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 international units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2. RASMCs were used with passages 4–9. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation—To evaluate DNA synthesis in cells, the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was determined. RASMCs (2.5 × 104) were seeded into a 24-well plate and incubated for 24 h in DMEM containing 10% FBS. After the cells were further incubated in DMEM containing 0.2% FBS for 48 h, they were treated with inhibitors or antibodies before stimulation. After an additional 24-h incubation, the cells were then pulsed with 2 μCi of [3H]thymidine for 16 h at 37 °C and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were fixed in methanol at 4 °C for 5 min and washed twice with 5% trichloroacetic acid. The acid-insoluble material was dissolved in 0.3 n NaOH at room temperature followed by radioactivity measurement with liquid scintillation counter. Cell Proliferation Assay—RASMCs (1 × 104) were plated onto 24-well culture plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After the cells were rendered quiescent in DMEM containing 0.2% FBS for 48 h, they were treated for 30 min with inhibitors or antibodies. The cells were stimulated with factor Xa for 48 h. The medium was removed, and the cell number/well was counted using a hemocytometer. Immunoblotting—For the ERK-1/2 activation experiment, RASMCs were allowed to grow to confluence in 6-well plates and made quiescent in DMEM containing 0.2% FBS for 48 h. After stimulation with agonists for 5 min in the presence or absence of antagonists, the cells were rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and treated with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice. Cell lysates were collected into microcentrifuge tubes, sonicated, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min. Protein concentration was measured in the supernatants using DC protein assay reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions and equalized for all samples. For PDGF and epiregulin immunoblotting, RASMCs were allowed to grow to confluence and made quiescent for 48 h. After stimulation with factor Xa, the cultured supernatants (5 ml) were concentrated using a Vivaspin concentrator with a 3-kDa cut-off molecular size (Vivascience). Reduced samples were resolved on NuPAGE™ 4–12% Bis-Tris gel and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. ECL detection method was employed for color development. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—RASMCs were allowed to grow to confluence in 24-well plates and made quiescent for 48 h. After washing and replacing with fresh medium, the cells were incubated with 100 nm factor Xa. After incubation, the cultured medium was collected and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min to remove debris. The concentrations of PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB in the medium were determined using Quantikine® immunoassay kits. Purification of Epiregulin from the Cultured Medium of Factor Xa-stimulated RASMCs—Epiregulin was purified from the RASMC-cultured medium that was treated with 50 nm factor Xa in serum-free DMEM for 6 h. The cultured medium (2 liters) was concentrated and subjected to diafiltration against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) (buffer A) with Amicon high output stirred cells using an ultrafiltration disc with a 3-kDa cut-off molecular size (Millipore). The medium was applied to a benzamidine-Sepharose column (1.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with buffer A, and then proteins were eluted with the same buffer. Mitogenic activity in each fraction was assayed by determining [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA in RASMCs. Active fractions were pooled and loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose column (1.5 × 4 cm) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.15 m NaCl. The adsorbed proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.15 ∼ 2 m NaCl in buffer A. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and separated in a Superose 12 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.15 m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Fractions containing mitogenic activity were concentrated and applied to SYMMETRY C8 HPLC column (Waters, 3.9 × 150 mm) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Bound proteins were eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 5–50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. SDS-PAGE was subsequently performed on NuPAGE™ 4–12% Bis-Tris gel for each active fraction. The gel was visualized by silver staining. The highly purified protein was used for N-terminal amino acid sequencing after alkylation with iodoacetamide. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—The expression level of epiregulin mRNA was analyzed using the reverse transcription-PCR method. For the RNA preparation, RASMCs were incubated for 48 h in DMEM containing 0.2% FBS and then treated with factor Xa for the times indicated. Total RNA was prepared by Ultraspect-II RNA system, and single-stranded cDNA was then synthesized from the isolated total RNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. A 20-μl reverse transcription reaction mixture containing 1 μg of total RNA, 1× reverse transcription buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), 1 mm deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 0.5 unit of RNase inhibitor, 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)15, and 15 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase was incubated at 42 °C for 15 min. After denaturation at 99 °C for 5 min, the cDNA was subjected to PCRs. PCRs were performed for 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 61 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min with each 3′ and 5′ primers based on the sequence of the rat epiregulin gene (5′-GTGTTGATTACAAAGTGTAGCTCTG-3′ and 5′-AGAAAGAAGTGTTCACACCGCAGACC-3′). The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as the internal standard (primer sequences, 5′-GACAACTTTGGCATCGTGGA-3′ and 5′-ACAACCTGGTCCTCAGTGTA-3′). The amplified PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector, and its nucleotide sequence was analyzed using the ALF automatic sequencing system (Amersham Biosciences). Expression Construct for Rat Epiregulin—The rat epiregulin cDNA was modified by PCR for pGEX-2T vector. The N-terminal primer (5′-GGATCCGTGTTGATTACAAAGTGTAGCTCTG-3′) contains a BamHI site. The C-terminal primer (5′-GAATTCTCACAGAAAGAAGTGTTCACACCGCAGACC-3′) contains a stop codon and an EcoRI restriction site. The thermal cycling reaction was performed with 30 cycles of steps (denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 61 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min). The modified PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector, and its nucleotide sequence were analyzed. For the expression construct for rat epiregulin, the pGEM-T-rat epiregulin vector was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and cloned into the expression pGEX-2T vector, which forms a fusion of glutathione S-transferase to the mature form of rat epiregulin. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Rat Epiregulin—The expression vector was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21. The transformants were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin to an absorbance of 0.5 at A600 nm, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubated for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. The expressed inclusion bodies of glutathione S-transferase-rat epiregulin were refolded. Briefly, the inclusion bodies were solubilized in 8 m urea solution (8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH8.5, 50 mm dithiothreitol). The unfolded fusion protein was refolded with rapid dilution against a refolding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH8.5, 10 mm cysteine, 1 mm cystine) at 4 °C for 48 h. The refolded fusion protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose and then incubated with thrombin for 12 h at room temperature while rocking. The eluted recombinant epiregulin was concentrated and applied to a SYMMETRY C8 column (Waters, 3.9 × 150 mm) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Bound proteins were eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 5–50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotide to Epiregulin—Sense (S-) (5′ to 3′) and antisense (AS-) (3′ to 5′) ODNs with phosphorothiolate linkages were designed to symmetrically cover the translation initiation sites of rat epiregulin. For rat epiregulin, the AS-ODN sequence was 5′-AAGTCTCCATCCTTCTC-3′, and S-ODN was 5′-GAGAAGGATGGAGACTT-3′. The specificity of the ODN for rat epiregulin was tested by Western blot analysis. Statistical Analysis—Data represented the mean ± S.E. of n experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired t test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Mitogenesis of Factor Xa-stimulated RASMCs—Factor Xa-induced mitogenesis of RASMCs was determined by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation and the cell number in RASMCs stimulated by the protease. As expected, factor Xa markedly increased [3H]thymidine incorporation into the cell and increased the cell number compared with unstimulated RASMCs. A similar mitogenic effect was also observed with thrombin-stimulated RASMCs (Fig. 1). To determine whether the mitogenic effect of factor Xa on RASMCs is dependent on its proteolytic activity, a competitive factor Xa inhibitor, rTAP, was employed. As shown in Fig. 1, rTAP significantly reduced the mitogenesis of RASMCs that was induced by factor Xa, indicating that the induction of RASMC mitogenesis is closely associated with the proteolytic enzyme activity of factor Xa. rTAP on its own did not influence the [3H]thymidine incorporation and proliferation of unstimulated cells (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that the mitogenic function of factor Xa may be caused by the local production of thrombin, the factor Xa-induced mitogenesis was examined in the presence of Pefabloc®TH, a specific thrombin inhibitor. Experimental results clearly indicate that Pefabloc®TH did not affect factor Xa-induced mitogenesis, whereas the thrombin-stimulated mitogenic effect was markedly suppressed by the inhibitor (Fig. 1). Pefabloc®TH did not influence the [3H]thymidine incorporation and proliferation of unstimulated RASMCs (data not shown). PDGF Independence of Factor Xa-induced [3H]Thymidine Incorporation and ERK-1/2 Activation—To determine whether the factor Xa-induced mitogenesis is associated with the secretion of PDGF, RASMCs were stimulated with factor Xa in the presence of anti-PDGF-AB polyclonal antibody, which neutralizes all three isoforms of PDGF, i.e. PDGF-AA, -AB, and -BB. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, the antibody failed to affect the increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation and ERK-1/2 phosphorylation in factor Xa-stimulated cells. To further investigate the requirement of autocrine PDGF for this particular mitogenic pathway, RASMCs were stimulated by factor Xa in the presence of Tyrphostin AG 1296, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of PDGF receptors (34Kovalenko M. Gazit A. Bohmer A. Rorsman C. Ronnstrand L. Heldin C.H. Waltenberger J. Bohmer F.D. Levitzki A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6106-6114PubMed Google Scholar). Experimental results indicate that neither the factor Xa-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation nor ERK-1/2 activation was influenced by the reagent (Fig. 2). In control experiments, it was demonstrated that the neutralizing antibody or tyrphostin AG 1296 completely suppressed the mitogenic effects induced by PDGF-BB (Fig. 2). The influence of the antibody or the inhibitor itself in the unstimulated cells was negligible on such mitogenic effects (data not shown). Analysis of Autocrine PDGF in the Cultured Medium—To assess whether factor Xa stimulates the secretion of PDGF from RASMCs, Western blot analysis was carried out. For this investigation, the cultured supernatant from untreated or factor Xa-treated RASMCs was concentrated and analyzed by Western blot using anti-PDGF-A or -B antibody. The obtained results indicate that the immunoreactive band recognized by the PDGF-A or -B antibody was not detected in the supernatants (data not shown). To further confirm the presence of PDGF-AB and -BB in the cultured medium, the concentrations of these growth factors were measured using Quantikine® immunoassay kits. The stimulation of RASMCs with factor Xa for up to 48 h did not result in any detectable secretion of PDGF-AB and -BB in the cultured medium (data not shown). The detection limits of all enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay systems used in the experiments were below 15 pg/ml. Autocrine-dependent DNA Synthesis and Cell Proliferation—To determine whether the factor Xa-induced mitogenesis is autocrine-dependent, the cultured supernatant was harvested from the factor Xa-stimulated RASMCs at various time intervals up to 6 h and then added to the serum-starved RASMCs after rTAP treatment to prevent the direct effect of factor Xa. The cells were then assayed for [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell proliferation. Experimental results demonstrate that the factor Xa-treated conditioned medium was successful in significantly increasing DNA synthesis and cell number in RASMCs (Fig. 3), whereas the medium of unstimulated cells failed to exert such mitogenic effects (data not shown). Anti-PDGF-AB antibody or tyrphostin AG 1296 did not affect the [3H]thymidine incorporation induced by the cultured medium containing rTAP, indicating that there is no requirement for autocrine PDGF in the particular mitogenesis induced by factor Xa (Fig. 3A). The mitogenic activity appeared 1 h after factor Xa stimulation and reached its plateau in 4 h (Fig. 3). Purification and Identification of the Autocrine Factor—Autocrine factor, which is responsible for the factor Xa-stimulated mitogenesis of RASMCs, was purified to homogeneity from two liters of the conditioned medium in four steps. After diafiltration against buffer A, the cultured medium was fractionated by affinity chromatography on a column of benzamidine-Sepharose. Mitogenic activity was recovered in the washing step of the column with buffer A, whereas factor Xa was retained in the column. When the pooled active fractions were applied to a heparin-Sepharose column, the mitogenic activity was recovered by washing the column with buffer A containing 0.15 m NaCl. The active fractions were then concentrated and fractionated in a gel filtration column (Fig. 4A). Finally, the mitogenic activity was further purified to homogeneity in a C8 reversed phase HPLC column (Fig. 4B). The protein eluted in a gradient of 28 ∼ 29% acetonitrile migrated as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 5 kDa under the reducing condition of SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4C). When the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified 5-kDa protein was determined through Edman degradation, it was revealed to be VLITKC-SSDM, which is identical to that of epiregulin. Expression of Epiregulin mRNA in Factor Xa-stimulated RASMCs—Reverse transcription-PCR was used to analyze the mRNA level of epiregulin in factor Xa-stimulated RASMCs. PCR primers were designed on the basis of the complete sequence of the rat epiregulin gene. After stimulation of the quiescent RASMCs with factor Xa, it was interesting to observe a rapid and transient induction of epiregulin mRNA. Expression of the mRNA reached its maximal level at 1 h and returned to the basal level in 6 h (Fig. 5). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Rat Epiregulin—The rat epiregulin cDNA was cloned and expressed in E. coli as a form of inclusion body. The expressed fusion protein containing glutathione S-transferase was refolded, adsorbed to the glutathione-Sepharose column, and then enzymatically cleaved at a specific site to remove the fusion partner. Recombinant epiregulin was further purified to homogeneity using C8 reversed phase HPLC column. The finally purified recombinant epiregulin migrated as a single band, which corresponded to native epiregulin, on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4C). The molecular identity of the recombinant epiregulin with the native protein was confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis and by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Then we examined the recombinant epiregulin for its functional ability to stimulate RASMC mitogenesis under serum-free conditions. As expected, the recombinant epiregulin was able to successfully stimulate the RASMC mitogenesis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6).

PLC-γ1 is implicated in a variety of cellular signalings and processes including mitogenesis and calcium entry. However, numerous studies demonstrate that the lipase activity is not required for PLC-γ1 to mediate these events. Here, we report that the phospholipase activity of PLC-γ1 plays an essential role in nerve growth factor (NGF)-triggered Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway activation in PC12 cells. Employing PC12 cells stably transfected with an inducible form of wild-type PLC-γ1 or lipase inactive PLC-γ1 with histidine 335 mutated into glutamine in the catalytic domain, we show that NGF provokes robust activation of MAP kinase in wild-type but not in lipase inactive cells. Both Ras/C-Raf/MEK1 and Rap1/B-Raf/MEK1 pathways are intact in the wild-type cells. By contrast, these signaling cascades are diminished in the mutant cells. Pretreatment with cell permeable DAG analog 1-oleyl-2-acetylglycerol rescues the MAP kinase pathway activation in the mutant cells. These observations indicate that the lipase activity of PLC-γ1 mediates NGF-regulated MAPK signaling upstream of Ras/Rap1 activation probably through second messenger DAG-activated Ras and Rap-GEFs.

When activated, PLC-γ1 provokes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-P2 to produce two second messenger molecules: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and DAG, which regulate the intracellular Ca2+ and activation of protein kinase C, respectively. PLC-γ1 plays a critical role in cell proliferation and differentiation. In mouse, PLC-γ1 is essential for embryonic development, as disrupted plcg1 alleles produce embryonic lethality at approximately day 9.0 (1Ji Q.S. Winnier G.E. Niswender K.D. Horstman D. Wisdom R. Magnuson M.A. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Furthermore, disruption of the plcg1 gene in Drosophila is not lethal but leads to abnormal eye development (2Thackeray J.R. Gaines P.C. Ebert P. Carlson J.R. Development. 1998; 125: 5033-5042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Micro-injection of PLC-γ1 induces DNA synthesis in quiescent NIH 3T3 cells, and antibodies to PLC-γ1 can inhibit serum- and Ras-stimulated DNA synthesis in NIH 3T3 cells (3Smith M.R. Ryu S.H.

Science. 1990; 247: 1074-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, multiple studies demonstrate that the mitogenic activity of PLC-γ1 is not dependent on its phospholipase activity, but requires its SH3 domain (5Smith M.R. Liu Y.L. Matthews N.T. Rhee S.G.

Recently, we have shown that PLC-γ1, through its SH3 domain, is a physiologic guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for PIKE (PI 3-kinase enhancer), a nuclear GTPase that activates nuclear phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity and mediates the physiologic activation by NGF for nuclear phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity (8Ye K.

Presumably, such mitogenic activity is associated with the activation by PIKE of nuclear phosphoinositide 3-kinase. In addition, the lipase activity is not needed for other major effects either, for example, the SH3 domain but not the lipase activity of PLC-γ1 has been shown to mediate agonist-induced Ca2+ entry in PC12 cells (10Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B.

York R.D. Stork P.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 544-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Upon activation, the ERK/MAPKs translocate to the nucleus to phosphorylate several transcription factors including Elk-1, NF-IL6/C/EBP/NF-M, and Tal-1 (12Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar, 13Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). NGF treatment induces differentiation of PC12 cells into a sympathetic neuron-like phenotype, and this effect is regulated by the sustained activation of ERKs. In PC12 cells, NGF triggers both transient and sustained MAP kinase signalings, which are regulated through two distinct small GTPases Ras and Rap1. The activated Ras and Rap1 stimulate sequential activation of Raf serine/threonine kinases C-Raf and B-Raf, respectively, which in turn activate MEK1/ERKs. The transient activation of Ras is regulated through its association with an adaptor complex consisting of Shc/Grb2/Sos. While the prolonged activation of ERK signaling depends on a distinct pathway initiated through NGF receptor TrkA binding to fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2, whose tyrosine residues are phosphorylated and provide docking sites for adaptor protein Crk, which in turn binds and activates the C3G GEF. The activated C3G subsequently provokes Rap-1/B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling (15Kao S. Jaiswal R.K. Kolch W. Landreth G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18169-18177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar).Numerous studies indicate that there is cross-talk between the MAPK pathway and PLC-γ1 signaling cascade. For instance, elimination of the Shc binding site in NGF receptor TrkA reduces NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells. However, total abrogation of differentiation is observed when both Shc and PLC-γ1 binding sites are eliminated (16Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Therefore, both Shc-mediated Ras-dependent and PLC-γ1-dependent pathways are essential for NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells. In addition, it has been shown before that PLC-γ1 mediates fibroblast growth factor-initiated C-Raf/MAPK activation through protein kinase C (18Huang J. Mohammadi M. Rodrigues G.A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5065-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Studies have also shown that it binds the Ras GEF Sos and enhances Ras activity (19Kim M.J.

Immunol. 2000; 30: 2378-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In addition, the SH3 domain of PLC-γ1 has been revealed to bind the proline-rich domain of SLP-76, and this interaction is required for T cell receptor-mediated activation of ERK, and nuclear factor of activated T cells (22Yablonski D. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4208-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, none of these studies explicitly defines the role of phospholipase activity of PLC-γ1 in MAPK signaling. Utilizing stable-inducible wild-type and lipase inactive PLC-γ1-(H335Q) PC12 cells, we demonstrate that the phospholipase activity of PLC-γ1 is required for NGF-triggered activation of the Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway. Our results indicate that the lipase activity of PLC-γ1 plays a critical role for some aspects of cellular signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Reagents—PC12 cells were maintained in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, and 100 units penicillin-streptomycin) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 atmosphere in a humidified incubator. The FLAG-tagged PLC-γ1 stably transfected PC12 cells (Tet-off cell line) were cultured in medium B (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml G418, 100 μg/ml hygromycin B, 2 μg/ml tetracycline, and 100 units of penicillin-streptomycin). PLC-γ1 was induced in medium without tetracycline for 24 h. Mouse monoclonal anti-HA, anti-Myc, anti-Ras antibodies, Protein A/G-conjugated agarose beads, U73122, and U73343 were from Calbiochem. Anti-PLC-γ1, anti-Rap1, anti-B-Raf, anti-c-Raf, and anti-ERK1/2 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-ERK was from New England Biolabs. Anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-FLAG and anti-Myc horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were from Sigma. myo-[2-3H]Inositol and [3H]phosphoinositide 4,5-P2 were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All chemicals not included above were from Sigma.Assay for PLC Activity—NGF-treated PC12 cells were lysed in an extraction buffer composed of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. After normalizing the protein concentration, 2 μg of anti-PLC-γ1 antibody and 40 μl of 50% slurry Protein A/G-agarose (Calbiochem) were added to the supernatant and incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 3 h. The agarose pellet was washed three times with buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.75 mm KCl, 0.416 mm CaCl2, 0.4 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm NaN3. The assay was performed as described previously using liposomes containing 30 μm cholesterol, 50 μm phosphatidylcholine, 30 μm phosphatidylethanolamine, 5 μm phosphoinositide 4,5-P2, 25,000 dpm of labeled [3H]phosphoinositide 4,5-P2, and 10 μm profiling (23Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Kim J.W. Machesky L.M. Rhee S.G. Pollard T.D. Science. 1991; 251: 1231-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). For the in vivo PLC-γ1 activity assay, induced and uninduced PC12 cells were labeled with myo-[2-3H]inositol (2 μCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in inositol-free medium for 24 h. The labeled cells were pre-treated with 20 mm LiCl for 15 min in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cells were then stimulated by NGF for the indicated times. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.6 ml of ice-cold 5% HClO4. After 30 min on ice, the extract was eluted through a Bio-Rad Dowex AG 1-X8 anion exchange column. Total inositol phosphate was eluted with a solution containing 1 m ammonium formate and 0.1 m formic acid, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting.Ras Binding Domain Affinity Binding Assay—PC12 cells were lysed in the Ras/Rap1 binding domain (RBD) assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and leupeptin. The lysates (3 mg of protein) were incubated with 30 μg of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-C-Raf-RBD at 4 °C for 45 min. The affinity precipitates were washed 3 times with lysis buffer and eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting analysis was performed with anti-Ras antibody.Raf Kinase Assay—Full details of the procedure were previously described (24Muslin A.J. MacNicol A.M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4197-4202Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, rabbit polyclonal anti-Raf-1 antibodies or preimmune serum were incubated with cell lysates for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were bound to Protein A/G-agarose beads for an additional 1 h. The beads were washed with 0.5 m LiCl solution, resuspended in 38 μl of buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 μm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate), 1 μl of 4 mm Syntide II peptide, and 0.1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was spotted onto Whatman P81 paper and air-dried. The paper was washed extensively with 0.85% phosphoric acid and counted in scintillation liquid.Preparation of RalGDS(RBD) Fusion Protein—The pGEX-RalGDS(RBD) plasmid encoding a GST fusion protein containing the 97-amino acid RBD of the RalGDS protein and its purification have been described previously (25Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar).Rap1 Activation Assay—Bacterial lysate (20 μl per sample) containing the GST-RalGDS(RBD) fusion protein was mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 1–2 h in the cold. After washing the beads twice with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, cell lysates were added and mixed with the beads for 1 h. The beads were then washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and bound proteins were resolved with SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed with 1 μg/ml anti-Rap1 antibody by Western blotting.RESULTSH335Q Mutation in the Catalytic Domain of PLC-γ1 Diminishes NGF-mediated Phospholipase Activity—To explore the effect of phospholipase activity of PLC-γ1 in NGF signaling, we employed tet-off PC12 cells stably transfected with the inducible form of FLAG-tagged PLC-γ1-WT and PLC-γ1-(H335Q), designated as PLC-γ1-LIM. A point mutation in the X-catalytic domain of PLC-γ1 (His335 → Gln) is catalytically inactive when expressed in mammalian cells (7Huang P.S. Davis L. Huber H. Goodhart P.J. Wegrzyn R.E. Oliff A. Heimbrook D.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To examine whether the inducible PLC-γ1-LIM could inhibit NGF-triggered phospholipase activity, we performed an in vitro lipase activity assay utilizing [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-P2 as a substrate, and normalized the enzymatic activity against empty vector-uninduced cells. When induced in the absence of tetracycline, cells transfected with wild-type PLC-γ1 display almost 1-fold augmentation of lipase activity even in the absence of NGF treatment compared with empty vector-transfected control cells. NGF treatment for 5 min for these cells leads to a further enhancement of PLC-γ1 activation, and the activity decreases somewhat at 30 min. By contrast, the lipase inactive mutant displays only 50% activity compared with control cells even without NGF stimulation, consistent with earlier findings (26Sultzman L. Ellis C. Lin L.L. Pawson T. Knopf J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2018-2025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with the control and PLC-γ1-WT cells, the lipase activity in the PLC-γ1-LIM cells is markedly inhibited in response to NGF stimulation (Fig. 1A). However, we observed essentially similar lipase activity in the uninduced PC12 cells (Fig. 1B). Expression of induced FLAG-tagged PLC-γ1 was verified (Fig. 1C). Tyrosine phosphorylation plays a critical role for the activation of PLC-γ1 (27Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). To determine whether cells transfected with PLC-γ1-LIM possess distinct tyrosine phosphorylation, we monitored tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1D). We observed a similar tyrosine phosphorylation effect upon NGF treatment in both PLC-γ1-WT and -LIM cells, indicating that the upstream signaling from NGF receptor TrkA to PLC-γ1 is intact in the lipase inactive mutant-transfected cells. To further evaluate the phospholipase activity in intact cells, we cultured both induced and uninduced cells in inositol-free medium supplemented with myo-[2-3H]inositol, and stimulated with NGF for various time points. PLC-γ1 activity analysis reveals similar results as in the in vitro assay (Fig. 1, E and F). The expression of PLC-γ1 in both induced and uninduced cells is shown (Fig. 1, G and H). We have observed similar effects in different clones of cells (data not shown). These data indicate that the exogenously expressed PLC-γ1 mutant acts in a dominant-negative manner despite expression of endogenous PLC-γ1.MEK1/MAP Kinase Signaling Is Abrogated in PC12 Cells Transfected with PLC-γ1-LIM—To evaluate the effect of phospholipase activity of PLC-γ1 on the NGF-mediated MAP kinase cascade, we monitored the activation of MAP kinase using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody. Cells transfected with PLC-γ1-WT display higher MAP kinase activity compared with control cells even in the absence of NGF, and NGF treatment elicits further stimulation. In contrast, MAP kinase activity is diminished in cells transfected with PLC-γ1-LIM (Fig. 2A). Consistent with this observation, pretreatment with 10 μm PLC inhibitor U73122 but not its inactive analog U73433 also inhibits NGF-stimulated MAP kinase activation (data not shown). However, other MAP kinase family members including JNK1 and p38 are not activated in any of these cells. Moreover, phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling is intact in these cells, as demonstrated by the phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 2B). Equal amounts of FLAG-tagged PLC-γ1 constructs are expressed (Fig. 2C). Different stable clones display similar effect upon NGF treatment (Fig. 2D). This observation, combined with diminished phospholipase activity in PLC-γ1-LIM cells, suggests that the overexpressed PLC-γ1-LIM-(H335Q) mutant is acting in a dominant-negative manner. Moreover, the PLC-γ1 metabolic products diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate might somehow contribute to NGF-elicited MAP kinase activation through mediating the upstream machinery. For example, NGF activates a DAG-regulated protein kinase, protein kinase C-δ, which appears to act between Raf and MAPK/ERK and is required for activation of MAPK cascade (28Corbit K.C. Foster D.A. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4209-4218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 2MEK1/MAP kinase signaling is abrogated in PC12 cells transfected with PLC-γ1-LIM.A, PLC-γ1-LIM reduces NGF-mediated MAP kinase activation. Cells transfected with empty vector, PLC-γ1-WT, or PLC-γ1-LIM were cultured in the absence of tetracycline for 24 h, before 100 ng/ml NGF was added. MAP kinase activation was analyzed with phospho-ERK antibody. Overexpression of PLC-γ1-WT slightly enhances MAP kinase activation compared with control cells. By contrast, PLC-γ1-LIM markedly diminishes it. B, verification of the expression of FLAG-tagged PLC-γ1-WT and PLC-γ1-LIM by Western blotting analysis. C, MAP kinase family members JNK1 or p38 are not activated by NGF in any of these cells. NGF-stimulated Akt phosphorylation is not influenced by PLC-γ1 in these cells. D, different stable clones display similar MAPK activation effects upon NGF stimulation. E, EGF-mediated MAP kinase activation is not affected by PLC-γ1-LIM. Cells transfected with PLC-γ1-WT or PLC-γ1-LIM were cultured in the absence of tetracycline for 24 h, before 50 ng/ml EGF was added. MAP kinase activation was analyzed with phospho-ERK antibody. F, MEK1 activation is abrogated in PLC-γ1-LIM cells. Cells transfected with empty vector, PLC-γ1-WT, or PLC-γ1-LIM were cultured in the absence of tetracycline for 24 h, before 100 ng/ml NGF was added. MEK1/2 kinase activation was analyzed with phospho-MEK1/2 antibody (top panel). An equal amount of MEK1/2 was employed in this analysis (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)NGF induces rapid and sustained MAPK signaling, whereas EGF stimulates transient MAP kinase activation in PC12 cells. To determine whether phospholipase activity of PLC-γ1 plays any role in EGF-provoked MAPK pathway, we examined the activation of MAP kinase using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody. Cells expressing PLC-γ1-WT and PLC-γ1-LIM reveal the same MAP kinase activity (Fig. 2E, upper panel). Similar amounts of MAP kinases are employed in Western blotting analysis (Fig. 2E, bottom panel). These data indicate that PLC-γ1 is specifically implicated in NGF but not EGF-stimulated ERK1/2/MAP kinase activation.p44/42 MAPK (ERK1 and ERK2) are activated by MEK1/2 through phosphorylation of Thr-202 and Tyr-203. To determine whether the diminished MAPK activation results from the abrogated upstream MEK1/2 kinase, we examined the phosphorylation status of MEK1/2 in these cells. Induction of PLC-γ1-WT substantially enhances the activation of MEK1/2 compared with the control cells. By contrast, the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 is completely inhibited in cells transfected with PLC-γ1-LIM, although equal levels of MEK1/2 are expressed in these cells (Fig. 2F), suggesting that upstream Raf signaling of MEK1/2 is affected by the phospholipase activity of PLC-γ1.NGF-stimulated Raf Kinase Activation Is Blocked in PLC-γ1-LIM Cells—PC12 cells express two members of the Raf family, B-Raf and C-Raf, both of which have been shown to be activated by NGF treatment as a consequence of their membrane translocation (29Oshima M. Sithanandam G. Rapp U.R. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23753-23760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Stephens R.M. Sithanandam G. Copeland T.D. Kaplan D.R. Rapp U.R. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To explore the effect of phospholipase activity of PLC-γ1 on Raf kinases, we examined the activity of both B-Raf and C-Raf kinases utilizing Syntide II peptide as a substrate. NGF-triggered Raf kinase activity is markedly blocked in PLC-γ1-LIM cells compared with empty vector or PLC-γ1-WT expressed PC12 cells (Fig. 3A). Both B-Raf and C-Raf kinases are substantially inhibited in cells expressing PLC-γ1-LIM even in the absence of NGF treatment, indicating that phospholipase activity of PLC-γ1 determines the basal, physiologic activity of Raf kinases as well as being responsible for its response to growth factor stimulation. B-Raf kinase displays higher activity than C-Raf in both cells, consistent with previous findings that NGF-stimulated MAP kinase activation is predominantly contributed by B-Raf (31Jaiswal R.K. Weissinger E. Kolch W. Landreth G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23626-23629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, we observed similar Raf kinase activity in uninduced PC12 cells with higher B-Raf activity than C-Raf (data not shown). These observations suggest that signaling upstream of the Raf kinase is influenced by phospholipase activity of PLC-γ1.Fig. 3NGF-stimulated Raf kinase activation is blocked in PLC-γ1-LIM cells.

To investigate whether small GTPases Ras and Rap1 are interfered by the phospholipase activity of PLC-γ1, we performed in vitro Ras and Rap1 activation assays employing RBDs of C-Raf and B-Raf to bind the activated, GTP-bound forms of Ras and Rap1. We observed robust association between Ras/Rap1 and GST-CRaf-RBD/GST-RalGDS in cells expressing PLC-γ1-WT even without NGF stimulation. NGF treatment further augments the interaction, and binding activity decreases after 30 min stimulation. However, we observed very faint Ras/Rap1 activity in cells expressing PLC-γ1-LIM compared with cells transfected with control vector or PLC-γ1-WT whether or not the cells were stimulated with NGF (Fig. 4). Metabolic labeling of PC12 cells with [32P]orthophosphate reveals similar results, NGF stimulation incurs more GTP bound Ras/Rap1 in cells expressing PLC-γ1-WT than PLC-γ1-LIM (data not shown). These observations demonstrate that phospholipase activity of PLC-γ1 mediates NGF-stimulated GTPase Ras and Rap1 activation in PC12 cells.Fig. 4Phospholipase activity of PLC-γ1 mediates NGF-stimulated GTPase Ras and Rap1 activation.

https://openalex.org/W2021091939,"RNase PH is a phosphate-dependent exoribonuclease that catalyzes the removal of nucleotides at the 3′ end of the tRNA precursor, leading to the release of nucleoside diphosphate, and generates the CCA end during the maturation process. The 1.9-Å crystal structures of the apo and the phosphate-bound forms of RNase PH from Pseudomonas aeruginosa reveal a monomeric RNase PH with an α/β-fold tightly associated into a hexameric ring structure in the form of a trimer of dimers. A five ion pair network, Glu-63-Arg-74-Asp-116-Arg-77-Asp-118 and an ion-pair Glu-26-Arg-69 that are positioned symmetrically in the trimerization interface play critical roles in the formation of a hexameric ring. Single or double mutations of Arg-69, Arg-74, or Arg-77 in these ion pairs leads to the dissociation of the RNase PH hexamer into dimers without perturbing the overall monomeric structure. The dissociated RNase PH dimer completely lost its binding affinity and catalytic activity against a precursor tRNA. Our structural and mutational analyses of RNase PH demonstrate that the hexameric ring formation is a critical feature for the function of members of the RNase PH family.

The maturation process of the longer precursor of RNA into a functional form is essential for cell growth and viability (1.Deutcher M.P. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1993: 377-406Google Scholar). Multiple endoribonuclease and exonucleases (exoRNases) 1The abbreviations used are: exoRNase, exoribonuclease; PNPase, polynucleotide phosphorylase; Sa, S. antibioticus; Ec, E. coli; Aa, A. aeolicus; Pa, P. aeruginosa; DTT, dithiothreitol; CHES, 2-[N-cyclohexylamino]ethanesulfonic acid; r.m.s., root mean square. are involved in this process to remove additional ribonucleotides from both ends of the RNA precursor (2.Bikoff E.K.

For tRNA, a series of processing reactions produces the double-stranded terminus at the 5′ end and the CCA terminus at the 3′ end for aminoacylation and protein synthesis (3.Mori M. Marchfelder A. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 4.Schurer H. Schiffer S. Marchfelder A. Morl M. Biol.

In bacterial tRNA-processing reactions, the removal of the 5′ extension sequence is a single step involving RNase P, a conserved endoribonuclease in all organisms (6.Frank D.N. Pace N.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). However, the trimming of the 3′ end requires several endo- and exoRNases; initially endoribonucleolytic cleavage occurs downstream of the CCA sequence (3.Mori M. Marchfelder A. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 7.Sekiya T. Contreras R. Takeya T. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5802-5816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and then a series of exoRNases, including RNase II, BN, T, D, and PH, removes the remaining ribonucleotides (8.Cudny H. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1518-1523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of all exoRNases, RNase PH and RNase T are known to be the most effective (9.Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). RNase PH is unique among all the exoRNases that participate in the tRNA maturation process in that it catalyzes the degradation of the 3′ end in a phosphate-dependent manner (10.Deutscher M.P. Marshall G.T. Cudny H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4710-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11.Kelly K.O. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17153-17158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It also shows synthetic activity; that is, the addition of ribonucleotides to the 3′ end of RNA with nucleoside diphosphate and inorganic phosphate (12.Ost K.A. Deutscher M.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition to the tRNA precursor, RNase PH can also cleave off the 3′ end of other small RNAs, including M1, 6 S, and 4.5 S RNA (13.Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although the sequences of these RNAs are significantly different, their structures are homologous to that of tRNA, and thus, it is likely that RNase PH recognizes and digests the substrate in a structure-specific manner rather than a sequence-specific manner (13.Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Another known phosphorolytic exoRNase, polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), can also cleave the 3′ end of a precursor tRNA (10.Deutscher M.P. Marshall G.T. Cudny H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4710-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, unlike RNase PH, PNPase shows an almost 100-fold lower relative activity on precursor tRNA compared with the nuclease activity on poly(A) (10.Deutscher M.P. Marshall G.T. Cudny H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4710-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), implying that the primary role of PNPase is in mRNA degradation (14.Donovan W.P. Kushner S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of Streptomyces antibioticus PNPase (Sa PNPase) has been determined (15.Symmons M.F. Jones G.H. Luisi B.F. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1215-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It shows that the PNPase forms a trimeric ring structure, where the central core of each monomer contains two repeats of a domain that we will term the “RNase PH-like domain,” since each repeated domain shares about 20% of its sequence identity with RNase PH from Escherichia coli (Ec RNase PH) (Fig. 1a; Refs. 15.Symmons M.F.

In PNPase, the putative active site is located in the second RNase PH-like domain, where the side chains of residues His, Thr, and Ser are liganded to the tungstate ion (15.Symmons M.F. Jones G.H.

A. 1988; 85: 4710-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), little is known about (i) whether the hexameric (or trimeric) ring structure formation is a conserved feature in the phosphorolytic exoRNase family, (ii) the functional significance of the ring structure in members of this family, and (iii) the binding mode and the catalytic mechanism of RNase PH against the substrate RNAs. During the preparation of this manuscript, the structure of RNase PH from hyperthermophilic Archea Aquifex aeolicus (Aa RNase PH) has been reported (18.Ishii R Nureki O Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32397-32404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although this study properly addresses several features of Aa RNase PH, including a phosphate-binding site, it is unclear from this study if the formation of the hexameric ring structure is significant for the exoRNase function of RNase PH. It has been reported that Ec RNase PH exists in several different oligomeric forms including a dimer (11.Kelly K.O. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17153-17158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thus, it is unknown whether the hexameric ring formation is required for binding to tRNA or for exoRNase activity. In this study, we determined the crystal structures of RNase PH from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa RNase PH) in apo form and in phosphate-bound form at 1.9- and 2.0-Å resolution, respectively. The crystal structures revealed a conserved ion-pair network and an ion-pair at the interface that appear to be critical for the formation of a hexamer. Based on this information, we carried out mutagenesis analyses on the arginine residues forming these ion-pairs and demonstrated that the hexameric ring formation is essential for the catalytic activity on the 3′ end of tRNA as well as the binding with precursor tRNA. Expression and Purification—DNA encoding Pa RNase PH was amplified by PCR, inserted into a pQE-30 vector using BamH1 and HindIII sites, and expressed in E. coli SG13009. The N-terminal His-tagged proteins were purified as suggested (Qiagen). Briefly, cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and the protein was purified by a nickel column. The imidazole gradient with solutions containing 20-250 mm imidazole in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol was applied to the column. The eluted proteins were further purified using Mono Q by NaCl gradient (0-500 mm). Finally, the gel filtration column was equilibrated with a buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm DTT. The proteins were finally concentrated to 20 mg/ml by ultrafiltration and stored at -70 °C until use. For the selenomethionine-substituted Pa RNase PH, B834(DE3) was used as a methionine auxotroph strain. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in selenomethionine minimal media. The protein was purified by the same method of native protein purification. For gel filtration analyses, wild-type and mutant proteins at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in a buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT) were loaded into a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Crystallization and Data Collection—The Pa RNase PH crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Briefly, the protein (20 mg/ml) in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 150 mm NaCl and 5 mm DTT was mixed with reservoir solution (1.2 m ammonium sulfate and 0.1 m NaCl in 0.2 m CHES buffer, pH 9.5) at an equal ratio. Four microliters of this mixture was equilibrated with 500 μl of reservoir solution at 18 °C. Selenomethionine-substituted crystals were grown under the same conditions. The rhombohedral crystals (up to 0.3 × 0.4 × 0.5 mm) appeared within 4-10 days. The crystals belong to the space group R32 with a = b = 111.1 Å, c = 115.8 Å. X-ray diffraction data were collected at -170 °C from a crystal flash-frozen in crystallization buffer containing 30% sucrose using the B6 beamline in the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory. The crystals were also grown by mixing an equal volume of protein in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 150 mm NaCl and 5 mm DTT and reservoir solution containing 100 mm citrate, pH 5.5, 1.0 m ammonium phosphate, and 200 mm NaCl. Four microliters of this mixture was equilibrated with 500 μl of reservoir solution at 18 °C. The resulting crystals also belong to the space group R32 with identical cell dimensions to those grown from ammonium sulfate. Data were processed with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (19.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38592) Google Scholar).

A selenomethionine derivative was used for multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing. The SOLVE program (20.Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar) identified six selenium positions and provided the initial phasing with three wavelengths (λ1 = 0.9792 Å, λ2 = 0.9793 Å, and λ3 = 0.9716 Å) for selenium multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data at 1.9-Å resolution.

The model was refined against a 1.9-Å selenomethionine derivative data set collected at a 0.9792-Å wavelength. During the refinement, the Rfree value was monitored using 5% of the data. The final model has 94% of the protein main chain (ϕ/ψ) angles in the most favored region and none in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot, calculated using PROCHECK (23.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.A. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The structure of a phosphate-bound Pa RNase PH was solved using the difference Fourier method and refined using CNS (22.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

In both structures most of the regions are clearly defined except residues 54-56. Structural Changes and Stability Measurement of Mutants—Structural changes of mutant proteins (10 μm) compared with wild type were monitored by a circular dichroism (CD) spectrometer (Jasco J-715) at various wavelengths (200-250 nm). Conformational changes for each mutant were also monitored at various temperatures by scanning with the CD spectrometer. The temperature was raised from 25 to 90 °C over 65-min periods, and detection was set on 222 nm. All the samples used here were prepared in the same buffer used in size exclusion analysis. Phosphorolysis Assay—For the substrate of Pa RNase PH, the Pa tRNAVal was cloned from genomic DNA from P. aeruginosa in a 3′-extended form, Pa tRNAVal- CCAATCTCAAGCT (tRNA-CCA-N10). Precursor tRNAVal was made by T7-RNA polymerase-directed in vitro transcription with a 3′-extended tRNAVal gene. For the phosphorolysis reaction, Pa RNase PH (740 nm) was added into a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, and 300 nm of precursor tRNA and incubated for 30 min at two different temperatures (30 and 50 °C). After extraction with phenol/chloroform, the products were resolved by a denaturing gel containing 12% polyacrylamide and 6 m urea and visualized using ethidium bromide. Substrate Binding Assay—For the substrate binding assay of Pa RNase PH, a Pa tRNAVal with two additional nucleotides in the 3′ end was prepared (tRNAVal-CCA-N2). The binding assay was performed in two different concentrations of Pa RNase PH (74 and 296 μm) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 300 nm of tRNAVal-CCA-N2. After incubation for 15 min at 18 °C, the samples were resolved by 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. Overall Structure of Pa RNase PH—The monomer of Pa RNase PH folds into a single domain α/β-fold comprised of nine β strands and six α helices (Fig. 1b). Two central helices, H2 and H4, are sandwiched between two β sheets, composed of S1 to S5 and S6 to S9. One long helix, H6, is packed against a second sheet (S6 to S9) and exposed to the surface, forming a βαβα structure (Fig. 1b). Fig. 1c shows the hexameric ring structure of Pa RNase PH, where each monomer is associated into a trimer of dimers by crystallographic symmetry operations. The gel filtration studies show that wild-type Pa RNase PH forms a hexamer in solution, consistent with the findings of our crystallographic analysis (see Fig. 5a). In the center of the hexameric ring a small channel with a diameter of 6 Å is formed by the H1 and the L5 loop (Fig. 1c). The inner surface of the ring is formed by the first sheet (S1 to S5) and the H2 helix. In the outer surface, four strands from the second sheet (S6 to S9) are connected to those from the adjacent monomer to form an eight-stranded β sheet, and the C-terminal helix H6 is packed with another H6 in an anti-parallel manner. In the phosphate-bound form of the crystal, a phosphate ion is located in the cleft formed by portions of the helices H2, H4, and H5, strands S6, S8, and S9, an L4 loop from the monomer, and the H2, S4, and L3 loop from an adjacent monomer, indicating that a phosphorolytic reaction might occur at this region of Pa RNase PH (Fig. 1, b and c). Fig. 1c illustrates a hexameric ring of Pa RNase PH that is viewed along the crystallographic 3-fold axis. In the hexameric ring a monomer is rotated by the crystallographic 2-fold axis that is perpendicular to the 3-fold axis to generate a Pa RNase PH dimer. This orients a phosphate-binding site in the monomer to face one direction and directs another phosphate-binding site in the next monomer to face the opposite direction. Consequently, each face of the hexameric ring contains three phosphate-binding sites. For convenience we will term the interfaces created upon formation of a dimer and a trimer as the “dimerization interface” and “trimerization interface,” respectively, throughout the text. The dimerization interface consists of the helices H2 and H6, and a strand S9 from each monomer (Fig. 1, c and d) and the trimerization interface is formed from the L4 loop and the β sheet consisting of S2 to S5 in the adjacent monomer (Fig. 1, c and d). Phosphate-binding Site—The overall structure of the apoPa RNase PH is essentially identical to that of the phosphate-bound form of Pa RNase PH, with a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of 0.2 Å for 239 Cα atoms. In the crystal structure of the phosphate-bound form of Pa RNase PH, a strong density over 7 σ was observed in the deep cleft formed in the dimerization interface, and we have modeled a phosphate ion into this density. In an apo form of the structure, a sulfate ion is located in this position. The cleft in Pa RNase PH is narrow, with a diameter of 8 Å, and a large part of this cleft is formed from the three helices (H2, H4, and H5), three strands (S6, S8, and S9), and a loop (L4) from one monomer together with a helix (H2), a strand (S4), and a loop (L3) from an adjacent monomer (Fig. 1c and Fig. 2). In addition, residues from a strand (S3) and a loop (L3) of another dimer are on the top of the cleft, participating in the formation of this cleft (Fig. 1c and Fig. 2). Within this deep and narrow cleft a phosphate ion resides on one side of the monomer and is liganded to four residues from the monomer and two water molecules; the side chains of Arg-87 and Arg-127 form ion pairs with the oxygen atoms of the phosphate ion (Fig. 3). The hydroxyl group of Thr-126, a conserved residue in both RNase PH and PNPase, makes an H-bond to the phosphate ion. The main-chain amide group of Gly-125 also makes an H-bond to the oxygen atom of the phosphate ion. Two water molecules form H-bonds with the oxygen atom of the phosphate ion. The structure of the phosphate-binding site of the apoPa RNase PH is virtually identical to that of the phosphate-liganded form of the Pa RNase PH; a phosphate ion has shifted by 0.2 Å compared with the position of the sulfate ion in the apoPa RNase PH, and a root mean square deviation between the residues surrounding the phosphate ion in two structures is less than 0.2 Å. Oligomerization Interface—The dimerization interface forms through the packing of portions of H6, the backbone of the S9, and an L8 loop from one monomer and the equivalent regions from another monomer (Fig. 1c). Interactions between residues from the helix H2 in one monomer and from the H2 in the adjacent monomer also contribute to this interface, which has a buried surface area of 2418 Å2 (Fig. 1d). Among the buried groups, 20% are polar groups, 23% are charged groups, and 57% are non-polar groups. The interactions between two monomers are mediated by a compact hydrophobic core of about 10 side chains in the N-terminal half of two H6 helices from each monomer; Val-190, Met-192, Phe-198, Val-201, and Leu-219 from one monomer and Pro-209, Phe-210, and Leu-215 from another monomer are clustered together to form this hydrophobic core. In addition to van der Waals contacts, the interface contains the networks of five backbone to backbone H-bonds between one S9 and another S9 strand. Five additional side-chain to side-chain H-bonds are observed in this interface. The trimerization interface is formed by the interaction between parts of H1, several loops including L1, L2, L4, and L6 and a β sheet (S2 to S5) from one monomer, and the equivalent regions in an adjacent monomer (Fig. 1c). Upon trimerization, 2938 Å2 of surface area becomes buried (Fig. 1d), and among the buried residues, 58% are non-polar groups. In contrast to the dimerization interface, where no ion pair was observed, a few symmetrically positioned ion pairs (networks) are formed in the trimerization interface; three conserved arginine residues in the L4 loop connecting S4 and H1 (Arg-69, Arg-74, and Arg-77) interact with the acidic residues from the strands S2 and S5 in the next monomer (Fig. 4, a and b). The guanidinium group of Arg-69 makes an ion pair with the carboxyl group of Glu-26. Two residues, Arg-74 and Arg-77, are involved in the five ion-pair network; Glu-63-Arg-74-Asp-116-Arg-77-Asp 118. More than 80% of the surface area of the residues in this ion pair network becomes buried upon trimerization. The importance of these ion pairs in the trimerization of dimers is indicated by the high conservation of the residues that are involved in these interactions in RNase PH family members (Fig. 2). In addition to the ion-pair formation, several van der Waals interactions and H-bonds contribute to the formation of the trimeric interface. Five backbone to side-chain H-bonds are formed in this interface, including the side chain of Arg-69 and the backbone carbonyl of His-24. The side chains of Leu-30, Ile-39, and Ile-120 from one monomer and the side chains of Leu-67, Pro-68, and Ile-120 from another monomer form a hydrophobic cluster. Comparison with PNPase Core Domain—As mentioned above, the Sa PNPase core domain that forms a trimeric ring contains two pseudosymmetrically related domains that share about 20% sequence identity with Pa RNase PH. Each domain of this central core in PNPase is very similar to the RNase PH monomer (15.Symmons M.F. Jones G.H. Luisi B.F. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1215-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The second repeat of PNPase (residues 350-567) shows more similarity to Pa RNase PH, with a r.m.s. deviation of 1.4 Å for 200 Cα atoms, whereas the first repeat of the PNPase core is more distantly related, with a r.m.s. deviation of 4.3 Å for 190 Cα atoms. Despite the high similarity in the overall structures between the two proteins, several major differences are observed in the two structures that may contribute to the discrepancies in substrate specificity. First, each strand that corresponds to the S6 to S7 in Pa RNase PH is longer by six residues in Sa PNPase. Second, the L3 loop between S3 and S4 is significantly longer in PNPase compared with the equivalent region in Pa RNase PH. In addition, this loop in PNPase is bent toward the cleft region containing residues 68-83 of another repeat in the core domain (an equivalent region to the phosphate-binding site in another monomer in RNase PH). Accordingly, the cleft region in the other RNase PH-like repeat adjusts its conformation properly to interact with this loop. Functionally, this conformational difference appears to be significant as this bent loop blocks the entrance of the cleft formed in the first RNase PH-like repeat in Sa PNPase. Consequently, as will be described later, this bent loop blocks the entrance, preventing a substrate from threading into this cleft. Consistent with this conformational difference, in PNPase a tungstate ion mimicking the phosphate ion binds to only the second RNase PH-like domain of the central core (15.Symmons M.F. Jones G.H. Luisi B.F. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1215-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and in contrast to Pa RNase PH, the trimeric ring of Sa PNPase has three putative active sites in only one face. Third, the helix H1 in RNase PH is shifted more closely (at least 5 Å) toward the phosphate ion compared with the equivalent region (residues 418-423) in PNPase. This leads the cleft in RNase PH to a more closed form compared with that in PNPase. Several significant differences are also observed between the phosphate-binding sites of these two proteins. First, only Thr-126 (Pa RNase PH), which has been proposed to function as a catalytic residue (15.Symmons M.F. Jones G.H. Luisi B.F. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1215-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 17.Jarrige A.C. Baey D.B. Mathy N. Duche O. Portier C. J. Mol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 32397-32404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), is a conserved residue that coordinates the phosphate ion in the two proteins. Second, instead of Ser-461 in Sa PNPase, the backbone amide of Gly-125 forms an H-bond to the oxygen atom of a phosphate ion. Third, Arg-423 in Sa PNPase is equivalent to Arg-87 in Pa RNase PH. However, the side chain of Arg-423 is directed away from the tungstate. Instead, an imidazole group of His-427 (Ile-91 in Pa RNase PH) is liganded to the tungstate ion (15.Symmons M.F. Jones G.H. Luisi B.F. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1215-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (225) Google Scholar). And fourth, Ser-423 in Sa PNPase is at the positio"

Antigenic cross-reactivity has also been reported between the antigens from KLH and Schistosoma mansoni, indicating a strong carbohydrate similarity (21.Markl J. Nour el Din M. Winter-Simanowski S.

J. 2002; 366: 217-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact location of the carbohydrates on the surface of native KLH is not known. Indeed, the arrangement of the subunits and their 160 FUs within the decamers is still under discussion, although a 15-Å resolution three-dimensional reconstruction of KLH1 didecamer has been obtained from low temperature transmission electron microscopy (11.Orlova E.V. Dube P. Harris J.R. Beckman E. Zemlin F. Markl J. van Heel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 417-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Sample Preparation—KLH1 was kindly provided by Dr. J. Markl (University of Mainz). After purification according to the procedure described by Harris et al. (12.Harris J.R. Gebauer W. Söhngen S.M. Markl J. Micron. 1995; 26: 201-212Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we verified the didecameric state of the molecules by transmission electron microscopy. The deoxygenation of the KLH1 samples was performed with nitrogen gas in a glove box. Because of the high oxygen affinity of KLH1, the partial oxygen pressure had to be kept below 1 torr to reach complete deoxygenation within 45 min. We judged the deoxygenation to be complete when the oxygen-dependent absorbance at 340 nm disappeared. During this procedure, the protein concentration increased by evaporation of some water. To work with the same concentration for the oxygenated sample, an aliquot of the deoxygenated protein solution was reoxygenated in a small test tube within minutes. The protein concentration was measured by light absorption at 278 nm. Using the extinction coefficient of 0.62 cm-1 mg-1 ml for KLH1, the protein concentration was determined to be 6.3 mg/ml for both the oxygenated and deoxygenated samples. Scattering Experiments and Data Treatment—The small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) data were measured at the beamline B1 of the HASYLAB synchrotron facility at the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY) at distances of 3.6 and 1.8 m. A wavelength λ of 1.38 Å was used, calibrated with the CuKα edge. Scattering intensities I(q) were obtained in the range of 0.008 Å-1 < q < 0.27 Å-1 with q = 4πλ-1sin(θ). The protein solutions and the buffer were measured in a flow-capillary at a temperature stabilized to 20 °C. Intensities were recorded on a multi-wire proportional counter with a size of 20 × 20 cm2 and with 256 × 256 pixels of electronic resolution. The actual resolution function of the detector and the conversion factor from pixel to length units was measured by placing a metallic plate with 30 × 30 pinholes in front of the detector and irradiating it with an isotropic scattering sample. The sensitivity of the detector was determined by fluorescent scattering of a Cu sample. The data were normalized to the intensity of the primary beam and to transmission and corrected for noise, detector response, and the buffer contribution. Details of the experimental technique and the evaluation procedure are described elsewhere (23.Haubold H.G. Gruenhagen K. Wagener M. Jungbluth H. Heer H. Pfeil A. Rongen H. Brandenburg G. Moeller R.

Biol. 1994; 240: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) using the measured geometric resolution function. This simultaneously gives the radial distribution function P(r). The radii of gyration (Rg) were calculated from the second moments of the radial distribution functions (24.Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982Google Scholar, 25.Svergun D.I. Koch M.H. Pedersen J.S. Serdyuk I.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26.Feigin, L. A., and Svergun, D. I. (1987) Structure Analysis by Small-angle X-Ray and Neutron Scattering (Taylor, G. W., ed), Plenum Publishing Corp., New YorkGoogle Scholar). The integrity of the protein after the experiment was checked by comparing different time frames of the measured intensities and by transmission electron microscopy. Neither aggregation nor dissociation of the KLH1 molecules was found in the samples used for the SAXS measurements. Monte Carlo annealing algorithm-based Three-dimensional Reconstruction of Small-angle Scattering Curves (MCSAS)—In this section, we give a short description of the MCSAS algorithm as it was applied to the reconstruction of the KLH1 structure. In more detail, the procedure is described elsewhere (27.Hartmann, H., and Decker, H. (2004) in Methods Enzymol, in pressGoogle Scholar). Applying the algorithm to simulated scattering curves, we were able to reconstruct excellent low resolution models (27.Hartmann, H., and Decker, H. (2004) in Methods Enzymol, in pressGoogle Scholar). At first, a cylinder was created obeying D5 symmetry and with dimensions that certainly include the KLH1 molecule with dimensions as obtained by electron microscopy. An asymmetric unit was filled with an electron density in the form of point charges (scattering points) randomly distributed. The whole cylinder was created by applying D5 symmetry operations. As it was shown previously (28.Henderson S.J. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1618-1627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the small-angle scattering intensity of a molecule can be calculated effectively from a random sample of the excess density. In contrast to a regular grid of densely packed scattering spheres (29.Chacon P. Moran F. Diaz J.F. Pantos E. Andreu J.M. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2760-2775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 30.Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar), the random arrangement of scattering points allows any symmetry restriction. No systematic holes or overlaps are generated at the interfaces among the asymmetric units. To minimize statistical density fluctuations on a length scale above the resolution limit, the mean distance between neighboring points was adjusted to one-third of the resolution of the data defined as dmin = 2π/qmax. By chance, a relative scattering amplitude or scattering length f of 0 or 1 was assigned to each point. Only points with a scattering amplitude f = 1 contribute to the small-angle scattering and to the shape of the molecule. From the points with f = 1, the radial distribution function P(r) was calculated and the scattering intensity of the model, Imod(q) was calculated with a sine transformation of P(r) as shown in Equation 1. Imod(q)=4π∫P(r)sin(qr)qrdr(Eq. 1) After scaling the modeled intensities to the experimental intensities (Iexp), the discrepancy factor χ2 was computed as shown in Equation 2, χ2=1n-1∑i=1nImod(qi)-Iexp(qi)σ(qi)2(Eq. 2) where n is the number of experimental intensities with standard deviation σ. Currently, in a cyclic Monte Carlo procedure, new configurations were created, gradually improving the correspondence between the calculated and measured intensities. A point was selected by chance, its scattering amplitude was inverted (if f = 1 then f = 0 and vice versa), and Δχ2, the change of χ2, was calculated. To allow the algorithm to search in the total configuration space, consistent with the experimental data, and not to become stuck in local minima, a criterion similar to the one used by Metropolis et al. (31.Metropolis N. Rosenbluth A.W. Rosenbluth N. Teller A.H. Teller E. J. Chem. Phys. 1953; 21: 1087-1092Crossref Scopus (27457) Google Scholar) was applied to the new configuration. A new configuration with Δχ2 ≤ 0 was accepted with probability p = 1. For Δχ2 > 0, the probability for accepting the configuration is then given by P = exp(-Δχ2/a). The parameter a formally corresponds to an annealing temperature. It was gradually decreased from ∼0.3 to 0.03 during one run. After equilibration typically reached with a total of 50,000 iterations, χ2 did not further decrease in the mean but was still fluctuating. Five configurations of the molecular model were saved, each after an additional 100,000 iterations. The whole procedure was repeated 20 times/data set with different seeds of the random number generator, giving a total of 100 models for oxygenated and deoxygenated KLH1. The speed of searching in the total configuration space was increased by randomizing the distribution of points and their scattering amplitudes from time to time. Prominent features of the KLH1 molecule were present in all of the individual models, but at a smaller scale artificial density, fluctuations showed up. To reduce the statistical fluctuations, all of the individual models were superim-posed and averaged density distributions were calculated for oxygenated and deoxygenated KLH1 molecules. Because small-angle data contain no information regarding the handedness of the molecule, each model was also tested with inverted coordinates and two enantimorphous classes were created and averaged individually. To compare the two different structures for oxygenated and deoxygenated KLH1, correlation coefficients were calculated for the two different combinations of the enantimorphous class averages. Based on these values, the more similar enantiomers were selected for comparison of oxygenated and deoxygenated KLH1 in Fig. 2. This procedure compares only the relative handedness of the two different enantimorphic classes. The absolute handedness was selected in such a way that the models, at least the model for deoxygenated KLH1 (compare “Results” and “Discussion”), are more similar to the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reconstruction (11.Orlova E.V.

The mean standard deviations σ for the averaged density distributions and the difference density were derived in the following manner. First, for each grid point, a standard deviation σi was calculated from the deviations of the individual densities ρi,m of the M models from the mean density ρ¯i as shown in Equation 3a. σi=1M-1∑m=1M(ρ¯i-ρi,m)2(Eq. 3) For the mean standard deviation σ, we used a root-mean-square average over all of the N grid points with density ρ¯i>0 as shown in Equation 3b. σ=1N∑i=1Nσi2(Eq. 4) The mean ± S.D of the difference density (Fig. 2e) was calculated by error propagation from the σ values for oxygenated and deoxygenated KLH1, σdiff=sqrt(σoxy2+σdeoxy2). We would like to mention that the above definitions of error levels are conservative choices. Using Equation 3b, all of the grid points contributing to the original model volume and not only grid points with density greater zero would lower the σ value. Furthermore, an average of σi would give a lower value for σ than the root of the mean of variances (Equation 3b). In addition, we would like to point out that a different definition for σ is used in crystallographic papers where the error level is not calculated from different models but is estimated from the variation within one density distribution or difference density distribution, respectively. We investigated a solution of KLH1 by SAXS in the absence and presence of molecular oxygen. The minima and maxima in the scattering curves are less developed for the oxygenated form, and they are shifted to higher q values by 1-2% (Fig. 1a). In the case of cylindrically shaped molecules, deeper minima correspond to a hollower cylinder, whereas shallow minima indicate a more filled cylinder. Thus, a comparison of the experimental intensities of deoxy-KLH1 and oxy-KLH1 revealed changes in the quaternary structure upon oxygenation, indicating that oxy-KLH1 is more compact. The difference between the scattering curves of the oxy- and deoxy-KLH1 is shown in Fig. 1b. The differences are well out of the range of experimental error. As a thorough test, the differences in the scattering curves were diminished by a least squares fit of one scattering curve (oxy) to the other (deoxy) with a variable contribution of scattering from protein, buffer, empty cuvette, and background as fit parameters. The differences in the scattering curves of the oxygenated and deoxygenated protein decreased only slightly by this fit, thus they can be regarded as highly significant. The demonstrated existence of different conformational states of KLH was expected from the fact that KLH with its 160 oxygen binding centers binds dioxygen, cooperatively serving as an oxygen carrier in vivo (14.Swerdlow R.D. Ebert R.F. Lee P. Bonaventura C. Miller K.I. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 113: 537-548Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The radii of gyration were determined from the SAXS data to be 163.8 ± 0.3 and 164.7 ± 0.3 Å for oxygenated and deoxygenated KLH1, respectively. These values are in good agreement with the values recently determined by small-angle neutron scattering, 163.7 ± 0.5 Å for oxygenated and 165.0 ± 0.6 Å for deoxygenated KLH1 (32.Hartmann H. Bongers A. Decker H. Eur. Biophys. J. 2001; 30: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Again, KLH1 seems to be slightly more compact in the oxygenated than in the deoxygenated state. Indirect Fourier transformation of the intensities gave distance distribution functions with a maximum size of dmax for KLH1 of ∼430 ±10 Å for both oxygenation states. To be able to compare direct experimental results from SAXS with the three-dimensional model obtained by TEM of stained KLH1 samples (11.Orlova E.V. Dube P. Harris J.R. Beckman E. Zemlin F. Markl J. van Heel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 417-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), we used the electron density distribution of the TEM model (kindly provided by Orlova et al. (11.Orlova E.V. Dube P. Harris J.R. Beckman E. Zemlin F. Markl J. van Heel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 417-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar)) to calculate the radius of gyration, distance distribution function, and small-angle scattering intensity for the TEM model. Standard procedures were applied for these calculations (24.Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982Google Scholar, 26.Feigin, L. A., and Svergun, D. I. (1987) Structure Analysis by Small-angle X-Ray and Neutron Scattering (Taylor, G. W., ed), Plenum Publishing Corp., New YorkGoogle Scholar). The scattering curve was calculated with the Debye equation. The distance distribution function from the spherically averaged auto-correlation function of the density distribution and the radius of gyration was calculated with Equation 4a (see below) in which the scattering amplitudes have to be replaced with density values in this case. A comparison of the simulated scattering curve (data not shown) with the SAXS intensities showed that the minima and maxima of the scattering curve calculated from the TEM model are shifted to lower q values by a factor of 0.88, which is equivalent to an increase in real space dimensions of ∼13%. This is reflected by the maximum distance taken from the distance distribution function. We determined a maximum distance of 490 Å for the TEM model, ∼14% larger than those obtained with SAXS. For the radius of gyration of the TEM model, we calculated a value of approximately 185 Å, which is 12% larger than the values obtained with small-angle scattering. This comparison reveals that the KLH1 molecule is smaller in solution than in the stained form when studied by TEM. Modeling of Oxygenated and Deoxygenated KLH1—Based on the SAXS data, we constructed models of KLH1 applying a new developed MCSAS. The well established D5 symmetry of molluscan hemocyanins (11.Orlova E.V. Dube P. Harris J.R. Beckman E. Zemlin F. Markl J. van Heel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 417-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) was applied to all of the models. Fig. 2 shows three-dimensional surface representations of KLH1 in the oxygenated and deoxygenated state. Surprisingly, the shapes of the surface are rather different for the oxy and deoxy forms. In contrast to oxygenated KLH1, the deoxygenated molecule shows a pronounced chirality. Five bulges extending over the whole length of the molecule are twisted around the cylindrical axis. This finding is in agreement with the first electron microscopical pictures of a snail hemocyanin 30 ago (33.van Driel R. Brunori M. Antonini E. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 89: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). No mass was detected at the center of the cylinder (Fig. 2d) as discussed previously (34.Mellema J.E. Klug A. Nature. 1972; 239: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, in both oxygenation states masses are concentrated at the two ends of the cylindrical molecules, forming the internal “collars.” To reveal differences between the modeled structures with respect to the length and the radius of the cylindrical KLH1 molecules, the radius of gyration as shown in Equation 4a, Rg=sqrt∑i=1Nfiri2∑i=1Nfi(Eq. 5) was split in a component Rz along the axes of the cylinder as shown in Equation 4b, Rz=sqrt∑i=1Nfizi2∑i=1Nfi(Eq. 6) and a radial component Rxy as shown in Equation 4c. Rxy=sqrt∑i=1Nfi(xi2+yi2)∑i=1Nfi(Eq. 7) Here ri denotes the center of mass distances of the N scattering points, xi, yi, and zi are the components of the distance vectors, and fi is the scattering amplitude. It should be mentioned that for a model consisting of scattering points, Equation 4a is equivalent to the commonly used calculation of Rg from the second moment of the electron density distribution (24.Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982Google Scholar) where the scattering amplitudes in Equation 4a are replaced by electron densities at grid points. By averaging the values of all of the individual models, we calculated the mean values and standard deviations for the model Rg and its components. For the deoxygenated molecule, we determined the values to Rz = 105.8 ± 1.5 Å and Rxy = 126.7 ± 1.1 Å and for the oxygenated molecule to Rz = 108.6 ± 1.3 Å and Rxy = 122.9 ± 1.0 Å. Thus, the mass-weighted length of the modeled oxy-KLH1 molecule is greater than that for the deoxygenated form, whereas the mean diameter is smaller. Qualitatively, this change of the overall structure is also reflected in difference density maps (Fig. 2e). While in the wall region of the cylindrical molecule, the deoxy model dominates the difference density (Fig. 2e, side view) and the density of oxygenated KLH1 is higher at the ends of the cylinder (top view). For the total radius of gyration averaged over the individual MC models, we calculated values of Rg = 165.1 ± 0.4 Å for deoxygenated and Rg = 164.0 ± 0.3 Å for oxygenated KLH1, which are in good agreement with the experimental values. The reconstructed models of KLH1 (Fig. 2) provide important information regarding the flexible in-solution structure. Although the changes of the overall dimensions of KLH1 are only ∼3%, a large translocation of masses occurs at the surface of the molecule during the conformational switch. The transition can be explained in the following way. In the deoxygenated molecule, the rod-shaped parts of the subunits forming the wall of the cylinder are inclined relative to the axes of the cylinder, producing the helical surface pattern (Fig. 2a). In oxygenated KLH1, the two decameric non-covalently and isologously associated half-molecules (11.Orlova E.V. Dube P. Harris J.R. Beckman E. Zemlin F. Markl J. van Heel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 417-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) are twisted against each other along the 5-fold symmetry axis, reducing the inclination angle of the subunits. Because of the more parallel arrangement of the subunits with respect to the axes of the cylinder, the length of the cylinder is increased accompanied by a reduction of the diameter. In this way, the helical surface pattern changes to a shape with a striped pattern (Fig. 2b). Our study provides the first real evidence as to how a molluscan hemocyanin changes during an allosteric transition. Thus, one can really look at allosteric transitions of these large proteins, which were inaccessible or not interpretable by other techniques. The surface of the 15-Å three-dimensional reconstruction of KLH1 based on TEM (11.Orlova E.V. Dube P. Harris J.R. Beckman E. Zemlin F. Markl J. van Heel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 417-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) shows a similar helical pattern as we deduced for the deoxy form from the SAXS data. This is surprising because for the TEM measurement KLH1 was stained in presence of atmospheric oxygen. It seems that exposure of specimen to high vacuum in the TEM experiments results in a rapid release of the reversibly bound oxygen within milliseconds as reported for the molluscan hemocyanin HtH1 (35.Meissner U. Dube P. Harris J.R. Stark H. Markl J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, KLH1 molecules contributing to the three-dimensional reconstruction by TEM are most probably in the deoxy state. This seems to be the case for all of the molluscan hemocyanins investigated by electron microscopy (11.Orlova E.V. Dube P. Harris J.R. Beckman E. Zemlin F. Markl J. van Heel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 417-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 34.Mellema J.E. Klug A. Nature. 1972; 239: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, SAXS may be considered as a very useful complementary method to TEM. As a consequence of these conformational transitions of KLH1 molecules, a strong influence on surface located epitopes is thought to be involved, which may result in differences in the immunological properties of this molecule extensively used in biology and therapeutic medicine. A strong influence of small changes on the surface of proteins such as conformational switches on the effectiveness of epitopes is indeed well documented for other proteins such as myoglobins (36.Berzofsky J.A. Berkower I.J. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1984: 595-644Google Scholar, 37.Crumpton M.J. Sela M. The Antigens. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1974: 1-79Crossref Google Scholar). However, this was never investigated or even considered for KLH, which is commonly used in biochemistry, physiology, immunology, and medicine. Based on our SAXS experiments, we postulate a similar effect for KLH1. It is easy to imagine that the structure and the accessibility of any epitopes on the surface may be different in the oxy and deoxy form of the KLH1 molecules when such massive changes in the surface structure are observed. Thus, our study strongly indicates that more information regarding the epitopes and their changes due to conformational transitions are needed to understand the immunological interaction of KLH1 at the molecular level. We thank Drs. G. Görigk (HASYLAB, Hamburg, Germany) and T. Nawroth (University of Mainz) for their help in performing the SAXS experiments. We also thank Dr. J. R. Harris (University of Mainz) for helpful criticism."
https://openalex.org/W1968417721,"Two novel mRNA transcripts have been identified that result from species- and tissue-specific, alternative polyadenylation and splicing of the pre-mRNA encoding the apolipoprotein B (apoB) editing catalytic subunit 1 (APOBEC-1) complementation factor (ACF) family of related proteins. The alternatively processed mRNAs encode 43- and 45-kDa proteins that are components of the previously identified p44 cluster of apoB RNA binding, editosomal proteins. Recombinant ACF45 displaced ACF64 and ACF43 in mooring sequence RNA binding but did not demonstrate strong binding to APOBEC-1. In contrast, ACF43 bound strongly to APOBEC-1 but demonstrated weak binding to mooring sequence RNA. Consequently ACF45/43 complemented APOBEC-1 in apoB mRNA editing with less efficiency than full-length ACF64. These data, together with the finding that all ACF variants were co-expressed in rat liver nuclei (the site of apoB mRNA editing), suggested that ACF variants might compete with one another for APOBEC-1 and apoB mRNA binding and thereby contribute to the regulation of apoB mRNA editing. In support for this hypothesis, the ratio of nuclear ACF65/64 to ACF45/43 decreased when hepatic editing was inhibited by fasting and increased when editing was re-stimulated by refeeding. These findings suggested a new model for the regulation of apoB mRNA editing in which the catalytic potential of editosomes is modulated at the level of their assembly by alterations in the relative abundance of multiple related RNA-binding auxiliary proteins and the expression level of APOBEC-1.

Alternative mRNA polyadenylation, splicing, and mRNA editing are mechanisms of post-transcriptional RNA processing that introduce diversity in mammalian mRNAs, thereby regulating the number of structurally and functionally different proteins encoded by a single gene (reviewed in Refs. 1.Lopez A.J.

Adenosine to inosine editing of mRNAs, such as that occurring on mRNAs encoding the glutamate-gated calcium channel and serotonin 2C receptor subunits, is mediated by a family of adenosine deaminases active on RNAs that function independently of cofactors to deaminate their cognate target within double-stranded RNA (reviewed in Ref. 5.Bass B.L.

The proteins, henceforth designated as ACF43 and ACF45, contain the NH2-terminal portion of ACF64 including all three RRMs and bind to both APOBEC-1 and apoB mRNA. The role these proteins may have in regulating hepatic apoB mRNA editing has been addressed in a metabolic model system. In fasted rats, a marked reduction in apoB mRNA editing activity was accompanied by an alteration in the relative abundance of ACF65/64 to ACF45/43 in the nucleus that was reversible upon restimulation of editing activity by refeeding. Based on their in vitro functional characteristics, it is proposed that the relative abundance of nuclear ACF65/64, ACF45, and ACF43, together with changes in APOBEC-1 abundance, modulate editosome assembly and activity. cDNA Isolation, RACE, and DNA Manipulations—Plaque hybridization screening of a λgt11-based rat liver 5′ stretch cDNA library (Stratagene) with radioactively labeled probes (RTS Rad-Prime system; Invitrogen) and 3′-RACE on Marathon ready rat liver cDNAs (Clontech) were performed according to the recommendations from the manufacturer. Rat genomic DNA (Clontech) was amplified using Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Subcloned λ inserts, 3′-RACE, and genomic DNA PCR products were sequenced using Big-Dye version 3.0 Terminator Cycle sequencing and the products analyzed in the Core Nucleic Acid Laboratory of the University of Rochester Medical Center. For Southern blot analysis, 10 μg of restriction enzyme-digested rat genomic DNA (Clontech) was resolved through 1% agarose and transferred to nylon membrane (Stratagene). Blots were hybridized to a 32P-labeled PCR-amplified exon 11A-specific probe in ExpressHyb (Clontech) at 60 °C, washed, and autoradiographed. Reverse transcript (RT)-PCR was performed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) to synthesize first-strand cDNA from oligo(dT)-primed total cellular RNA prior to amplification of specific transcripts with Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). Antibody Generation and Immunoprecipitations—Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against peptides corresponding to amino acids 4–18 (NH2-terminal) (28.Sowden M.P. Ballatori N. de Mesy Jensen K.L. Hamilton Reed L. Smith H.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 508–522 (COOH-terminal) of ACF64 and affinity-purified (Bethyl Laboratories). Rat liver nuclear extracts were UV cross-linked to apoB RNA (38.Smith H.C. Methods. 1998; 15: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and the complexes immunoprecipitated with NH2- or COOH-terminal specific antibody at 4 °C overnight. The complexes were bound to Protein A-agarose (Oncogene) for 2 h, washed extensively by vortexing in phosphate buffer containing 1 m NaCl and eluted with 3 m sodium thiocyanate, acetone-precipitated, resolved by 10.5% SDS-PAGE, and identified by autoradiography. Rat Fasting/Refeeding Regime—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g; Taconic Farms) were housed in metabolic cages and control rats fed regular chow. Experimental rats were fasted for 48 h but allowed access to drinking water or fasted for 48 h and then fed on high sucrose diet (Low EFA Purified diet; Purina) for 48 h prior to sacrifice. Cytoplasmic and Nuclear S100 Extract Preparation—Cytoplasm and purified nuclei were isolated from perfused rat livers as described previously (28.Sowden M.P. Ballatori N. de Mesy Jensen K.L. Hamilton Reed L. Smith H.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Van Mater D. Sowden M.P. Cianci J. Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Ballatori N. Smith H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—Cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained as recommended. Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and total cellular RNA or protein was isolated as previously described (40.Sowden M.P. Smith H.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). APOBEC-1, ACF43, ACF45, and ACF64 proteins were expressed with HA and/or V5 epitope tags at their amino and carboxyl termini, respectively, from a modified pcDNAIII (Invitrogen). Drosophila S2 cells (Invitrogen) were maintained in Schneider's modified media (Invitrogen) as recommended. 3 × 106 cells were transfected with a total of 2 μg of DNA in six-well cluster plates using FuGENE 6 and harvested 48 h after DNA addition. PCR-amplified acf cDNA variants, apobec-1, and apoB DNA (nucleotides 6413–6802) were subcloned into pAc 5.1-V5-His (Invitrogen). RNA Editing Assays—apoB RNA editing efficiency was determined upon RT-PCR-amplified transfected human apoB reporter RNA transcripts by poisoned primer extension analysis (40.Sowden M.P. Smith H.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and quantified by PhosphorImager densitometry. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—cDNAs for acf43, acf45, acf64, and apobec-1 were subcloned into pAS2–1 and pACT2 (Matchmaker System; Clontech) and two-hybrid analyses conducted in yeast strain Y190. All yeast manipulations, β-galactosidase filter assays, and histidine prototrophy screens were performed according to the recommendations from the manufacturer. Protein Expression and Purification—cDNAs for acf43, acf45, and acf64 were subcloned into a modified pET28a Escherichia coli expression vector (Novagen) encoding epitope tags and hexahistidine motifs such that proteins could be expressed under isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction and purified by nickel affinity chromatography (Qiagen) (41.Galloway C.A. Sowden M.P. Smith H.C. BioTechniques. 2003; 34 (528:530): 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). RNA Binding Assay—Ultraviolet cross-linking assays were performed as previously described using 498-nucleotide in vitro transcripts of apoB RNA (38.Smith H.C. Methods. 1998; 15: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), NF-1 RNA (42.Skuse G.R. Cappione A.J. Sowden M. Metheny L.J. Smith H.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), or WT-1 (a control RNA lacking mooring sequence motifs) (17.Yang Y. Kovalski K. Smith H.C. J. Biol.

For protein excess competition, purified recombinant ACF64, ACF45, and/or ACF43 were combined in editing buffer prior to the addition of radiolabeled apoB RNA and UV cross-linking. Oligonucleotides Used in RT-PCR Analyses—Oligonucleotides used were 64 (5′-CAGTTACGTTAGGTACACCC), 65 (5′-TATATGCCAAATACCCAC), 43 (5′-AAGCCAGTGGACAAGGAC), and 45 (5′-ACATGGATGTGGTGCACACC). Identification and Molecular Cloning of Rat acf45 and acf43 cDNAs—Screening of a rat liver cDNA library with a full-length human acf cDNA together with 3′-RACE techniques identified two clones of 1394 and 1916 bp. Both were 100% identical to the 5′ 1240 bp of full-length rat acf64 (28.Sowden M.P. Ballatori N. de Mesy Jensen K.L. Hamilton Reed L. Smith H.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but diverged at the 3′ end, where both sequences were polyadenylated. The cDNAs encoded 405- and 383-amino acid proteins, respectively, for which the theoretical molecular masses were 45 and 43 kDa and which were therefore referred to as ACF45 and ACF43. The possibility that acf45 and acf43 mRNAs resulted from alternative splicing of rat acf pre-mRNA was suggested by the recent finding of multiple alternatively spliced variants of human acf pre-mRNA (23.Dance G.S.C.

Davidson N.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1522: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To investigate this, the genomic region encompassing exons 11 and 12 (by comparison to the human acf gene structure) was PCR-amplified, subcloned, and sequenced. BLAST analyses of the resultant 2277-bp fragment with the two cDNAs indicated the exon structure shown in Fig. 1 with the corresponding COOH-terminal amino acid sequences of the translation products indicated below. The exons are numbered with respect to the human acf gene, although it remains to be determined whether the two genes share identical exon structure 5′ of this region. acf45 cDNA appeared to be encoded by splicing of exon 11 to exon 11A and utilization of a polyadenylation signal in intron 11A; the stop codon for the resulting translation product being located in the 3′ end of exon 11A (Fig. 1, Table I). acf43 cDNA appeared to be derived by inclusion of intron 11 and exon 11A and the utilization of the same polyadenylation sequence as acf45. Although acf43 mRNA is longer than acf45 mRNA, the inclusion of the intron introduced a stop codon within the 5′ end of intron 11, thereby giving rise to the shorter translation product (Fig. 1, Table I). Rat acf65 and acf64 cDNAs appeared to result from exon 11A skipping and alternative splicing of exon 11 to include or exclude, respectively, the 5′-most 24 nucleotides of exon 12 in a manner analogous to human acf pre-mRNA (Fig. 1, Table I, and Ref. 23.Dance G.S.C.

Each of the splice sites and the polyadenylation signal conformed to their respective consensus motifs (Table I) (43.Hastings M.L. Krainer A.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 44.Zhao J. Hyman L. Moore C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

To investigate this possibility, rat genomic DNA was analyzed by Southern blotting (Fig. 2) using diagnostic restriction sites located within exons 11 and 11A and their flanking intronic sequences. An exon 11A-specific probe hybridized only to the predicted single EcoRI, StyI, and 0.56-kb BamHI fragments. Importantly, the probe hybridized only to the predicted 1.0- and 0.77-kb fragments in the RsaI digest. The lack of probe hybridization to other restriction fragments indicated that there was only one gene that encodes acf65, acf64, acf45, and acf43. acf65, acf64, acf45, and acf43 mRNAs Are Co-expressed in a Species- and Tissue-specific Manner—If ACF45 and ACF43 are translation products of alternatively spliced acf transcripts, then mRNAs encoding the identified cDNAs should exist. RNA species shorter than those encoding ACF64/65, however, were not detected in normal rat liver poly(A)+ RNA by Northern blot analysis (25.Mehta A. Kinter M.T. Sherman N.E. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1846-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 28.Sowden M.P. Ballatori N. de Mesy Jensen K.L. Hamilton Reed L. Smith H.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, acf43/45-specific RNAs were below the detection limits of ribonuclease protection assays. Therefore, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of total cellular RNA from rat liver was performed using primers to co-amplify acf65 and acf64 (primers 64 and 65 in Fig. 1) or acf45 and acf43 (primers 43 and 45 in Fig. 1). Products of the predicted size for both acf45 and acf43 were observed (Fig. 3A, Liver + lane). A transcript that includes intron 11 and is therefore represented by the larger PCR product encodes ACF43. ACF45 is encoded by splicing of intron 11, so the smaller PCR product had to have arisen from RNA and not genomic DNA. Therefore, acf45 and acf43 transcripts were expressed in rat liver, and they were expressed simultaneously with acf64/65 as alternative spliced mRNA variants. The acf gene in both human and rats encodes the alternative 5′ end of exon 12 that is included in the alternative splicing of acf65 mRNA (23.Dance G.S.C. Sowden M.P. Cartegni L. Cooper E. Krainer A.R. Smith H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12703-12709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26.Henderson J.O. Blanc V. Davidson N.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1522: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, exon 11A of the rat gene had no similar DNA sequence or amino acid coding potential within the equivalently sized intron 11 of the human gene (23.Dance G.S.C. Sowden M.P. Cartegni L. Cooper E. Krainer A.R. Smith H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12703-12709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability to carry out acf43/45 alternative polyadenylation and splicing was species-specific. Total cellular RNA isolated from several rat tissues was evaluated for the alternative processing of acf64/65 and acf43/45 mRNAs using the discriminating primer pairs. All RNA variants were amplified from the same cDNA synthesis reaction; therefore, the identification of acf64/65 amplicons serves as the positive control for the cDNA synthesis reactions in which acf43/45 mRNAs were not detected. Consistent with previous findings (23.Dance G.S.C. Sowden M.P. Cartegni L. Cooper E. Krainer A.R. Smith H.C. J. Biol.

However, acf43/45 mRNAs were only detected in liver and small intestine (Fig. 3A). These data demonstrate tissue-specific expression of acf43/45 mRNA in the two tissues that support apoB mRNA editing and, together with ACF43/45 protein binding to apoB mRNA (see Figs. 4 and 6; Refs. 16.Harris S.G.

Here we show that although the UmuD′2C complex remains intact through multiple chromatographic steps, excess UmuD, the precursor to UmuD′, displaces UmuD′ from UmuD′2C by forming a UmuDD′ heterodimer, while UmuC concomitantly aggregates as an insoluble precipitate. Although soluble UmuD′2C is readily detected when the two genes are co-transcribed and translated in vitro, soluble UmuD2C or UmuDD′C are not detected. The subunit exchange between UmuD′2C and UmuD offers a biological means to inactivate error-prone polymerase V following translesion synthesis, thus preventing mutations from occurring on undamaged DNA.

The Escherichia coli SOS response was first described in the mid-1970s (1Radman M. Hanawalt P. Setlow R.B. Molecular Mechanisms for the Repair of DNA, Part A.

Based upon the inherent error-prone nature of TLS, it is perhaps not too surprising that the activity of the Umu proteins is regulated at transcriptional and post-translational levels (10Goodman M.F. Woodgate R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2000; 65: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The umu genes are arranged in an operon and are negatively regulated at the transcriptional level by the SOS repressor LexA (7Bagg A. Kenyon C.J. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5749-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the umu operon is one of the tightest regulated in the LexA regulon (11Fernandez de Henestrosa A.R. Ogi T. Aoyagi S. Chafin D. Hayes J.J. Ohmori H. Woodgate R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1560-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), transcriptional regulation is incomplete, and the cellular levels of UmuD and UmuC are additionally kept to a minimum through their rapid Lon-mediated proteolytic degradation (12Frank E.G.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3889-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). After cellular DNA damage, RecA nucleates on regions of singlestranded DNA and mediates the post-translational self-cleavage of LexA leading to its inactivation and derepression of genes in the LexA regulon, including umuD and umuC (4Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 407-522Google Scholar). UmuD undergoes a mechanistically similar cleavage reaction (14Shinagawa H. Iwasaki T.

A. 1988; 85: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In the case of UmuD, cleavage of its N-terminal 24 amino acids converts it to UmuD′ and activates it for its role in SOS mutagenesis (16Nohmi T. Battista J.R. Dodson L.A. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1816-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). UmuD and UmuD′ both form homodimers but when mixed together associate preferentially as a UmuDD′ heterodimer (17Battista J.R. Ohta T. Nohmi T. Sun W. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5251-5258Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Degradation of the mutagenically active UmuD′ subunit helps return cells to a resting state once cellular DNA damage has been repaired and the need for pol V has abated. In vitro replication assays reveal that regulation of the catalytic activity of pol V is also complex and is modulated through multiple protein-protein interactions. For example, pol V does not catalyze TLS alone but is, instead, an essential component of a multiprotein “mutasome” complex composed of RecA protein, β sliding-clamp, and single-strand binding protein (19Echols H. Goodman M.F. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 70: 17-50Crossref Scopus (619) Google Scholar). When taken in conjunction with the observation that pol V is, for all intents and purposes, catalytically inactive in the absence of UmuD′ or RecA (21Tang M. Shen X. Frank E.G. O'Donnell M.

Although a soluble UmuD′2C complex can be purified over multiple chromatographic steps, UmuD′ is readily displaced from UmuC by UmuD, concomitantly causing UmuC to aggregate as an inactive insoluble precipitate. Subunit exchange between UmuD′2C and UmuD provides a biologically plausible way to curtail the activity of error-prone pol V following TLS and thus reduces the chance that mutations will occur on undamaged DNA during SOS. Materials—Ultrapure deoxyribonucleotides were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. ATPγS was purchased from Roche Applied Science. RecA protein was purified as described previously (25Cox M.M.

Wild type UmuD, UmuD1 (P27S) mutant, and UmuD′ were purified following protocols described previously (8Woodgate R. Rajagopalan M. Lu C. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The in vitro transcription/translation kit (E. coli T7 S30 extract system for circular DNA) was purchased from Promega. Interaction between pol V and in Vitro35S-Labeled UmuD Protein— Purified UmuD protein was labeled in vitro following a protocol modified from previous studies (29Browder L.W. Wilkes J. Rodenhiser D.I. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 30Kalinich J.F. McClain D.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the labeling reaction, UmuD (5 mg/ml) and Trans35S label mix from ICN Biomedicals (0.5 mCi/ml) were incubated in 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.5) and 10 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 20 h. The mixture was loaded first to a Bio-spin P-6 column from Bio-Rad and then to a 20-ml Sephadex G-75 column to isolate the 35S-labeled proteins. Fractions containing labeled UmuD2 homodimer were collected. Unlabeled pol V (UmuD′2C complex) was mixed with 35S-labeled UmuD2 homodimer in a 1:3 ratio (0.7 μm and 2.1 μm, respectively) in R buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol) with 300 mm NaCl and incubated at 37 °C for different lengths of time. Samples were chilled on ice before centrifugation at 14,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 10 min. The soluble supernatant was then separated on a 20-ml Superdex G-75 column at 4 °C. The radioactivity from each gel filtration fraction was measured on a liquid scintillation counter, and SDS-PAGE was used to determine the distribution of35S-labeled UmuD and unlabeled pol V subunits. A control experiment was carried out with35S-labeled UmuD2 homodimer incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Polymerase V Catalyzed Primer Extension and Translesion Synthesis Assay—A synthetic 30-nucleotide primer (5′-ACT GAC CCC GTT AAA ACT TAT TAC CAG TAA-3′) was 5′-labeled with32P and annealed to a 39-nucleotide template (5′-TAC AGG XGT TTA CTG GTA ATA AGT TTT AAC GGG GTC AGT-3′) containing an abasic site (X), generating a 9-nucleotide overhang downstream of the primer 3′-end. The abasic site (X) on the template was 3 nucleotides from the primer 3′-end. The reaction buffer contained 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH7.5), 8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 25 mm sodium glutamate, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and 4% (v/v) glycerol. Polymerase V (400 nm) was either pre-incubated at 37 °C alone for 3 min or with purified UmuD, UmuD1, or UmuD′ proteins before being added to a mixture of DNA (10 nm), RecA (250 nm), ATPγS (1 mm), and 4 × dNTPs (200 μm each) to initiate the reaction. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and quenched by adding an equal volume of 95% formamide, 40 mm EDTA. The products were heat-denatured and separated on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Radioactive gel bands were analyzed on a PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Cross-linking Study of Interaction between pol V and UmuD—The method used for cross-linking experiments was adapted from Ref. 31Sutton M.D. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar. Polymerase V, UmuD, UmuD′, and bovine serum albumin were incubated in different combinations at 37 °C for 10 min in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm MgCl2, and1mm dithiothreitol before formaldehyde was added to 1% to initiate cross-linking. The mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature following the addition of formaldehyde and quenched by SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples were heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min and resolved on a 14% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was conducted with antibodies that react with UmuDD′ and UmuC to identify UmuD-, UmuD′-, and UmuC-containing species. In a set of control experiments, pol V was first incubated with formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature to allow cross-linking between UmuC and UmuD′ subunits before UmuD protein was added and further co-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. In Vitro Transcription/Translation of UmuC, UmuD′, and UmuD— Plasmids pUmuC (pEC47), pUmuD′ (pEC48), and pUmuD (pJM103) are pET11 derivatives that overproduce UmuC, UmuD′, and UmuD, respectively, from a T7 promoter (27Frank E.G. Hauser J. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8169-8173Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 28McDonald J.P. Maury E.E. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These plasmids were used as templates for in vitro expression of the various proteins. The in vitro transcription/translation reactions were carried out using the E. coli T7 S30 Extract System for Circular DNA (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. l-[35S]Methionine (ICN Biomedicals) was used in the reactions to radiolabel the synthesized protein products. The radiolabeled products were confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Formation of potential complexes among UmuC, UmuD′, and UmuD were analyzed by separating the products through a 4-ml Superdex G-200 gel filtration column as follows. Immediately following the in vitro transcription/translation reactions, the reaction mix was briefly treated with DNase and RNase; 40 μl of each sample was applied, without centrifugation, to a Superdex G-200 column and separated at 4 °C in the presence of R buffer containing 300 mm NaCl. 100-μl fractions were collected and separated on SDS-PAGE, and the radioactivity in each band was determined by phosphorimaging. Subunit Swapping of pol V with35S-Labeled UmuD Protein—We have purified pol V as a native heterotrimeric complex (UmuD′2C) that remains intact and stable in aqueous solution (9Bruck I. Woodgate R. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10767-10774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast, UmuC containing the polymerase active site (21Tang M. Shen X. Frank E.G. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8919-8924Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 24Reuven N.B. Arad G. Maor-Shoshani A.

Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7301-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 9Bruck I. Woodgate R. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

Maor-Shoshani A. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31763-31766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Aside from the observation that pol V can be purified as a UmuD′2C heterotrimer (9Bruck I. Woodgate R. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10767-10774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), little is known about the physical properties of the heterotrimeric complex. An important aspect regarding the regulation of pol V is to determine the ability of pol V to exchange the UmuD′ subunits bound to UmuC. Using35S-labeled UmuD, we measured the exchange of the UmuD′ subunit in pol V by the mutagenically inactive UmuD subunit (Fig. 1). Purified pol V and [35S]UmuD (present primarily in the form of a dimer, i.e. [35S]UmuD2) were incubated for 1, 10, and 60 min, and the products were resolved by gel filtration with Superdex G75. Both peaks containing35S are present in the G75-included volume (Fig. 1a). There is a decreasing amount of35S label co-eluting with the UmuD2 or UmuDD′ dimer peak with increasing incubation time (Fig. 1a, fractions c and d) and an increasing amount of35S label with the UmuD monomer peak (Fig. 1a, fraction g), demonstrating the loss of input [35S]UmuD2 homodimer caused by the replacement of [35S]UmuD with UmuD′ to form [35S]UmuDD′ heterodimers. The presence of increasing levels of [35S]UmuD at 10 min and 1 h imply that the concentration of released monomeric [35S]UmuD is too dilute to re-form a [35S]UmuD2 homodimer. The identity of the product in each peak was determined using Coomassie Blue-stained gels (Fig. 1b). The “heavy” peaks (Fig. 1b, fractions c and d) corresponding to a 10-min incubation contain both UmuD and UmuD′. The heavy peaks elute with a molecular mass consistent with a UmuDD′ heterodimer complex (Fig. 1a). The “light” peak (Fig. 1b, fraction g) is composed primarily of UmuD and contains a trace amount of UmuD′ (Fig. 1b); this peak elutes with molecular mass markers corresponding to monomer species (Fig. 1b). As a control, [35S]UmuD was incubated in the absence of pol V for 60 min and remained intact as a dimer (Fig. 1a, inset). Absent from any of the gel elution fractions, including the void volume, were UmuD2C or UmuDD′C, whereas “free” UmuC was detected as an insoluble aggregate contained in the centrifuged pellet of the UmuD′2C/[35S]UmuD2 exchange reaction by Western blotting against the protein resolubilized in 8 m urea (data not shown). Polymerase V Is Stabilized by UmuD′ and Destabilized by UmuD—The gel filtration data demonstrate the important point that the UmuD′ subunits of the pol V heterotrimer in solution are exchangeable with free UmuD or UmuD2, resulting in the formation of UmuDD′ while releasing UmuC as an insoluble precipitate. The corollary to this observation is that incubation of UmuD with pol V should inactivate the polymerase, because the catalytic activity is present only in UmuC (21Tang M. Shen X. Frank E.G. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8919-8924Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 24Reuven N.B. Arad G. Maor-Shoshani A. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31763-31766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The ability of pol V to copy undamaged DNA and to catalyze TLS is reduced in the presence of UmuD, the inhibition being much stronger at higher concentrations of UmuD (Fig. 2). A similar result occurred when pol V was incubated with UmuD1, a noncleavable UmuD mutant that cannot be converted to UmuD′ in the presence of activated RecA (32Koch W.H. Ennis D.G. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 233: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). In contrast, a small but significant (2-fold) stimulation of pol V activity occurs in the presence of excess UmuD′ (Fig. 2). Thus, although the UmuD′2C complex is relatively stable and is able to maintain its integrity through multiple purification stages (9Bruck I. Woodgate R. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10767-10774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21Tang M. Shen X. Frank E.G. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8919-8924Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), the exchange of free UmuD or UmuD′ proteins with a UmuD′ monomeric component of pol V (UmuD′2C), nevertheless, takes place. Stimulation of pol V could occur if the inactive UmuD′C is converted to active UmuD′2C in the presence of excess UmuD′. Our data, therefore, imply the existence of an equilibrium between UmuD′2C and UmuD′C that strongly favors UmuD′2C. Identification of pol V Subunit Exchange Products by Formaldehyde Cross-linking Analysis—Combined formaldehyde cross-linking and Western blot analyses were performed to identify the complexed and free forms of the Umu proteins following the addition of excess UmuD or UmuD′ to pol V (Fig. 3). Incubation of UmuD alone followed by cross-linking with formaldehyde resulted in the formation of a UmuD2 complex and free UmuD (Fig. 3, lane 4), and a similar experiment using UmuD′ resulted in formation of UmuD′2 and free UmuD′ (Fig. 3, lane 5). Co-incubation of UmuD and UmuD′ followed by cross-linking of the products resulted in the appearance of one additional complex of UmuDD′ (Fig. 3, lane 6). In a parallel experiment using formaldehyde cross-linking, when increasing amounts of UmuD were incubated with a fixed amount of pol V, the exchange product was UmuDD′ (Fig. 3, lanes 8-10). An equally important observation concerns the putative exchange products that are not observed in solution; neither UmuD2C nor UmuDD′C complexes were detected (Fig. 3, lanes 8-10). That is, essentially all of the UmuD′2C (Fig. 3, lane 7) was converted to a UmuDD′ plus UmuC, and no soluble formaldehyde cross-linked UmuD2C or UmuDD′C complexes were observed. The absence of detectable free UmuC by Western analysis (Fig. 3, lanes 8-10) is attributable to its insolubility in aqueous solution (8Woodgate R. Rajagopalan M. Lu C. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7301-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 9Bruck I. Woodgate R. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23824-23829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) causing it to aggregate and form a visible precipitate. However, a clear UmuC signal was observed on a Western blot of pol V incubated in the absence of UmuD (Fig. 3, lane 7). The addition of increasing amounts of UmuD′ to pol V resulted in the recovery of only pol V (where both UmuC and UmuD′ are detected) + free UmuD′ (Fig. 3, lanes 11-13). There was a roughly 1.5-2.0-fold increase in the intensity of the UmuD′2C band incubated in the presence of excess UmuD′ (Fig. 3, lanes 11-13) compared with no incubation with UmuD′ (Fig. 3, lane 7). These data are consistent with those showing that an excess UmuD′ stimulates pol V activity by a similar 1.5-2-fold increase (Fig. 2). There was no UmuDD′ exchange observed when proteins were cross-linked with formaldehyde prior to the protein co-incubation reactions (Fig. 3, lanes 17-19). Once again, our data imply that there is ongoing subunit exchange within pol V and that formaldehyde cross-linking helps minimize the exchange and the aggregation of insoluble UmuC. Transcription/Translation in Vitro Synthesis of pol V to Identify Putative Umu Complexes—Although it is tempting to suggest that soluble complexes composed of UmuD2C do not occur based on the inability to detect them by swapping UmuD and UmuC subunits using highly purified proteins (Figs. 1 and 3), it is nevertheless possible that such complexes can still form in vivo. Perhaps the best chance of mimicking “life-like” conditions in vitro is to use a transcription/translation system to co-express35S-labeled UmuC and UmuD proteins (Fig. 4). Each of the overexpressed 35S-labeled protein products, UmuC, UmuD, and UmuD′, were readily detected by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4a) or by SDS-PAGE following gel filtration on Superdex G200 (Fig. 4, b-f). UmuD′ and UmuC gave products of the expected mass. In vitro transcription/translation of UmuD gave two products, one that corresponds to full-length UmuD and one that migrates slightly faster than UmuD′. The expression of this smaller protein was variable and was even evident in a noncleavable mutant of UmuD, suggesting that its expression was driven from the UmuD plasmid itself and not from posttranslational modification of UmuD during the in vitro transcription/translation reactions. When UmuC is expressed alone and chromatographed on G200, it is detected only as a high molecular weight aggregate in the excluded volume (Fig. 4b). Expression of either UmuD′ (Fig. 4c) or UmuD (Fig. 4d) results primarily in the formation of homodimers of each protein. The key results are that when UmuC and UmuD′ are co-expressed, fractions corresponding to pol V are detected (Fig. 4e, fractions designated as “UmuD′2C”). In contrast, when UmuC and UmuD are co-expressed, no soluble complex appears to form between the two proteins (Fig. 4f). These data are consistent with the formaldehyde crosslinking data in which no soluble UmuD2C complex was observed (Fig. 3). Although UmuD alone migrates as a soluble dimer (Fig. 4d), when mixed with UmuC, a fraction of the UmuD elutes in the void volume along with insoluble UmuC. The data indicate that UmuD and UmuC are able to interact physically and that the interaction causes both UmuD and UmuC proteins to aggregate as insoluble precipitates. A likely explanation for the absence of UmuC in the gel filtration void volume for the subunit exchange reaction (Fig. 1) is that the insoluble protein aggregates and is removed by centrifugation prior to loading the sample on the column. A key difference in the two gel filtration experiments is that UmuC is present in μg amounts when carrying out subunit exchange using purified proteins (Fig. 1) but only in ng amounts using the transcription/translation system (Fig. 4). We also carried out similar in vitro co-expression experiments with noncleavable UmuD1 in place of wild type UmuD, and the results obtained were similar to that seen with wild type UmuD (data not shown). In an experiment where UmuC, UmuD1, and UmuD′ were all co-expressed together, most of the UmuD1 and UmuD′ migrated as a soluble heterodimer, whereas UmuC and a small fraction of UmuD1D′ eluted in the void volume as insoluble aggregates. Biological Relevance of pol V Subunit Exchange—Based upon the known biochemical properties of the Umu proteins, it has been hypothesized that they form a variety of protein complexes. UmuD and UmuD′ can exist as homodimers but prefer to heterodimerize whenever possible. UmuC may exist as a monomer as well as in a complex with UmuD2, UmuDD′, and UmuD′2. Although the UmuD and UmuD′ proteins have been successfully isolated in both homodimeric (8Woodgate R. Rajagopalan M. Lu C. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7301-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 15Burckhardt S.E. Woodgate R. Scheuremann R.H. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1989; 86: 7301-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), UmuC has only been isolated in significant quantities as a soluble UmuD′2C complex (9Bruck I. Woodgate R. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10767-10774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21Tang M. Shen X. Frank E.G. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

A. 1998; 95: 9755-9760Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), thereby raising the question of whether UmuC, UmuD2C, or UmuDD′C are present in vivo. And, if present in vivo, they may still be largely insoluble in the cell. To date, monomeric UmuC has only been isolated as a recombinant maltose-binding protein fusion (24Reuven N.B. Arad G. Maor-Shoshani A. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31763-31766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) or as a native untagged form but only after denaturation and renaturation of the overexpressed protein (8Woodgate R. Rajagopalan M. Lu C. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7301-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 33Petit M.-A. Bedale W. Osipiuk J. Lu C. Rajagopalan M. McInerney P. Goodman M.F. Echols H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23824-23829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A key step in the purification of denatured/renatured UmuC included affinity chromatography utilizing UmuDD′ proteins as the ligand. UmuC bound avidly to this column and could only be eluted under denaturing conditions (8Woodgate R. Rajagopalan M. Lu C. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7301-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These observations were originally interpreted as indicating tight complex formation between UmuDD′ and UmuC. However, given our inability to detect any such complexes in solution, we now believe it much more likely that UmuDD′ caused UmuC to aggregate and precipitate on the column. In vivo, co-expression of UmuDD′ and UmuC also led to a dramatic increase in the half-life of UmuC (34Frank E.G. Gonzalez M. Ennis D.G. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3550-3556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation was also taken as an indication that UmuDD′ interacts with UmuC so as to protect it from Lon-mediated degradation. Perhaps a more likely alternative hypothesis, based on our current data, is that the apparent increase in the stability of UmuC resulted from interactions between UmuDD′ and UmuC that caused UmuC to aggregate within the cell, thereby making it inaccessible to Lon-proteolysis. The in vivo and in vitro data taken together offer convincing evidence that any interaction between UmuC and UmuD2 or UmuDD′ appears quantitatively and qualitatively different from that involving UmuD′2C. The latter is stable and resistant to cellular proteolysis and is readily purified as a complex (9Bruck I. Woodgate R. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10767-10774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21Tang M. Shen X. Frank E.G. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1998; 95: 9755-9760Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Even so, the pol V complex is susceptible to subunit exchange. We propose that subunit exchange provides an internal “selfdestruct” mechanism to curtail the activity of error-prone pol V following TLS, and this reduces the chance that mutations will occur on undamaged DNA during SOS. Our data show that subunit exchange between the UmuD′2C complex and intact UmuD has two dramatic effects. First, it most likely leads to the inactivation of the catalytic function of UmuC as the protein aggregates as an insoluble precipitate (Fig. 5). Second, it results in the formation of a soluble UmuDD′ complex in which UmuD′ is susceptible to rapid proteolysis by ClpXP (Fig. 5). It is possible that monomeric UmuC and UmuD2C exist in a cell, but the physical properties of such Umu complexes appear to be entirely different from that of the soluble and catalytically active UmuD′2C (pol V). Thus, based on current biochemical data, we invoke Occam's razor to suggest that the sole soluble complex involving UmuC in the cell is a heterotrimer composed of UmuD′2C, which is very likely the biologically relevant form of pol V (20Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 70: 17-50Crossref Scopus (619) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W1972874474,"The yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase (RNAP) is composed of the core RNAP, Rpo41, and the mitochondrial transcription factor, Mtf1. Both are required for mitochondrial transcription, but how the two proteins interact to create a functional, promoter-selective holoenzyme is still unknown. Rpo41 is similar to the single polypeptide bacteriophage T7RNAP, which does not require additional factors for promoter-selective initiation but whose activity is modulated during infection by association with T7 lysozyme. In this study we used the co-crystal structure of T7RNAP and T7 lysozyme as a model to define a potential Mtf1 interaction surface on Rpo41, making site-directed mutations in Rpo41 at positions predicted to reside at the same location as the T7RNAP/T7 lysozyme interface. We identified Rpo41 mutant E1224A as having reduced interactions with Mtf1 in a two-hybrid assay and a temperature-sensitive petite phenotype in vivo. Although the E1224A mutant has full activity in a non-selective in vitro transcription assay, it is temperature-sensitive for selective transcription from linear DNA templates containing the 14S rRNA, COX2, and tRNAcys mitochondrial promoters. The tRNAcys promoter defect can be rescued by template supercoiling but not by addition of a dinucleotide primer. The fact that mutation of Rpo41 results in selective transcription defects indicates that the core RNAP, like T7RNAP, plays an important role in promoter utilization."
https://openalex.org/W2019540703,"The p50 subunit of NF-κB is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of a variety of genes. Previously, we showed that the expression of Ku antigen, a DNA repair protein, is mediated by NF-κB in gastric cancer AGS cells (Lim, J. W., Kim, H., and Kim, K. H. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 46093–46100). In this study, we report that the inhibition of Ku activity reduced both p50 expression and nuclear NF-κB activity in AGS cells. A co-immunoprecipitation experiment demonstrated that Ku antigen interacted with recombination signal-binding protein Jκ (RBP-Jκ), a DNA-binding protein. Ku antigen, RBP-Jκ, and p50 were found to bind to the DNA region containing the κB element in the p50 promoter. Supershift and competition experiments demonstrated that Ku antigen and RBP-Jκ bound sequence-specifically to downstream elements of κB at GCTTC and TGGGGG. mRNA expression and de novo synthesis of p50 were inhibited in cells transfected with the mutant gene expression constructs for IκBα, Ku80, and RBP-Jκ. A reporter assay demonstrated that p50 transcription was positively mediated by NF-κB, Ku antigen, and RBP-Jκ and that the binding elements for these proteins were required for optimal p50 expression. The interaction of Ku antigen with RBP-Jκ and NF-κB p50 may act as a positive regulator of p50 expression in gastric cancer AGS cells."
https://openalex.org/W2094502865,"FLI-1 is a transcriptional regulator of the ETS family of proteins. Insertional activation at the FLI-1 locus is an early event in F-murine leukemia virus-induced erythroleukemia. Consistent with its essential role in erythroid transformation, enforced expression of FLI-1 in primary erythroblasts strongly impairs the response of these cells to erythropoietin (Epo), a cytokine essential to erythropoiesis. We show here that point mutations in the ETS domain that abolished FLI-1 binding to specific DNA elements (ETS-binding sites) suppressed the ability of FLI-1 to transform erythroblasts. The exchange of the entire ETS domain (DNA binding domain) of FLI-1 for that of PU.1 changed the DNA binding specificity of FLI-1 for that of PU.1 and impaired FLI-1 transforming properties. In contrast, ETS domain swapping mutants that maintained the DNA binding specificity of FLI-1 did not affect the ability of FLI-1 to transform erythroblasts. Deletion and swapping mutants that failed to inhibit the DNA binding activity of FLI-1 but impaired its transcriptional activation properties were also transformation-defective. Taken together, these results show that both the ability of FLI-1 to inhibit Epo-induced differentiation of erythroblasts and to confer enhanced cell survival in the absence of Epo critically depend upon FLI-1 ETS-binding site-dependent transcriptional activation properties.

FLI-1 is a member of the ETS family of transcriptional regulators, which plays an essential role in development and oncogenesis (for review see Ref. 1.Truong A.H. Ben-David Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6482-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). FLI-1 shares with other ETS proteins a conserved ETS domain that is responsible for its targeting to the nucleus and specific binding to 10-bp-long DNA sequences centered over a GGA core (ETS-binding sites (EBSs) 1The abbreviations used are: EBSs, ETS-binding sites; Epo, erythropoietin; wt, wild type; HA, hemagglutinin; NLS, nuclear localization signal; tk, thymidine kinase; NTAD, N-terminal transactivation domain; CTAD, C-terminal transactivation domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; RT, reverse transcriptase; hEpo, human Epo.1The abbreviations used are: EBSs, ETS-binding sites; Epo, erythropoietin; wt, wild type; HA, hemagglutinin; NLS, nuclear localization signal; tk, thymidine kinase; NTAD, N-terminal transactivation domain; CTAD, C-terminal transactivation domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; RT, reverse transcriptase; hEpo, human Epo.) (2.Mao X. Miesfeldt S. Yang H. Leiden J. Thompson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18216-18222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When bound to specific EBSs in the context of cellular, viral, or model promoters/enhancers, FLI-1 most often activates transcription, a property that relies on two activation domains localized on the C-terminal and N-terminal sides of the ETS domain (3.Gegonne A.

However, in the context of specific promoters, FLI-1 binding results in transcriptional repression through ill defined mechanisms (6.Czuwara-Ladykowska J. Shirasaki F. Jackers P. Watson D.K.

In addition to its transcriptional regulatory properties resulting from its tethering to DNA, FLI-1 has been shown to modulate in trans the activity of other unrelated transcriptional regulators through protein-protein interactions (8.Darby T.G.

The human FLI-1 and the highly related ERG genes are rearranged as the result of specific chromosomal translocations in >95% of the cases of Ewing sarcoma, a pediatric tumor of neuroectodermal origin (10.Delattre O. Zucman J. Plougastel B. Desmaze C. Melot T. Peter M. Kovar H. Joubert I. de Jong P. Rouleau G. Aurias A. Thomas G. Nature. 1992; 359: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar, 11.Zucman J.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4481-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). In this disease, the 3′-part of FLI-1 or ERG is translocated to the 5′-half of EWS, a member of the TET gene family of RNA-binding proteins (12.Bertolotti A. Lutz Y. Heard D.J. Chambon P. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The resulting fusion gene encodes an EWS-FLI-1 or EWS-ERG fusion protein in which the N-terminal activation domain of FLI-1/ERG is replaced by the potent N-terminal activation domain of EWS, thereby generating an altered regulator of EBS-driven transcription (13.Bailly R.

The molecular events involved in EWS-FLI-1 transforming properties remain to be characterized but appear to rely on both DNA binding-dependent and DNA binding-independent properties (18.Jaishankar S.

FLI-1 was originally identified as a common proviral integration site in erythroleukemia induced in the newborn mouse by the F-murine leukemia virus component of the Friend virus complex (for review see Refs. 1.Truong A.H. Ben-David Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6482-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar and 20.Ben-David Y. Giddens E.B. Letwin K. Bernstein A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 908-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The other component of the Friend virus complex, SFFV, induces erythroleukemia in adult mouse. In this case, the hallmark of the disease is the proviral insertional activation of Spi-1/PU.1, another member of the ETS gene family (21.Moreau-Gachelin F. Tavitian A. Tambourin P. Nature. 1988; 331: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The early phase of F-murine leukemia virus-induced erythroleukemia is characterized by the expansion of erythroblasts in the spleen of infected animals and by severe anemia. The emergence of proliferating erythroblasts is concomitant with the rearrangement of the FLI-1 locus and the activation of FLI-1 expression (20.Ben-David Y. Giddens E.B. Letwin K. Bernstein A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 908-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 22.Howard J. Yousefi S. Cheong G. Bernstein A. Ben-David Y. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2721-2729PubMed Google Scholar). At that stage, proliferating cells are not immortalized, and additional genetic events are required, including the loss of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, to bypass senescence and induce immortalization (22.Howard J. Yousefi S. Cheong G. Bernstein A. Ben-David Y. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2721-2729PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Howard J. Berger L. Bani M. Hawley R. Ben-David Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1405-1415PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with its central role in F-murine leukemia virus-induced erythroleukemia, enforced expression of FLI-1 in a mouse erythroleukemic cell line (7.Tamir A. Howard J. Higgins R. Li Y. Berger L. Zacksenhaus E. Reis M. Ben-David Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4452-4464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and primary avian erythroblasts (24.Pereira R. Tran Quang C. Lesault I. Dolznig H. Beug H. Ghysdael J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1597-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) has been shown to strongly interfere with the normal response of these cells to erythropoietin (Epo), a cytokine essential to erythropoiesis (25.Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 83: 59-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 26.Lin C.S. Lim S.K. D'Agati V. Costantini F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying the transforming properties of FLI-1 in erythroblasts are mostly not understood. They have been proposed to involve FLI-1 interference with molecular events important for erythroid differentiation (7.Tamir A. Howard J. Higgins R. Li Y. Berger L. Zacksenhaus E. Reis M. Ben-David Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4452-4464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Darby T.G. Meissner J.D. Ruhlmann A. Mueller W.H. Scheibe R.J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 3067-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and FLI-1-directed activation of novel genes not normally expressed in erythroblasts (27.Lesault I. Quang C.T. Frampton J. Ghysdael J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 694-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We report here the analysis of the DNA binding activity, transcriptional regulatory properties, and erythroblast transforming ability of a series of FLI-1 mutants. Our results show that the transforming properties of FLI-1 in primary erythroblasts are critically dependent upon its binding activity to specific EBSs. In addition, both the survival-inducing and differentiation-inhibiting properties of FLI-1 require a transcriptionally active protein, indicating that they involve the transcriptional activation of specific genes. DNA Constructs and Generation of Recombinant Retroviruses—The pRCAS-A (no insert), pRCAS-mEpoR, pSFCV (no insert), and pSFCV-FLI-1, encoding a HA-tagged version of wild type (wt) FLI-1, have been described previously (24.Pereira R. Tran Quang C. Lesault I. Dolznig H. Beug H. Ghysdael J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1597-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28.Tran Quang C. Wessely O. Pironin M. Beug H. Ghysdael J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5639-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To generate pBS-wtFLI-1, the XhoI + SacI insert obtained following XhoI + SacI digestion of ΔEB-HA-FLI-1 (24.Pereira R. Tran Quang C. Lesault I. Dolznig H. Beug H. Ghysdael J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1597-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was cloned into XhoI + SacI-restricted pBluescript (pBS). To generate pBS-FLI-[R337,340L], the EcoRI(partial) + HindIII 658-bp fragment obtained from ΔEB-EWS-FLI[R337,340L] (13.Bailly R. Bosselut R. Zucman J. Cormier F. Delattre O. Roussel M. Thomas G. Ghysdael J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3230-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) was inserted into EcoRI + HindIII-restricted pBS-wtFLI-1. The insert encoding FLI-1[R337,340L] was released by XhoI + HindIII digestion and subcloned into the XhoI + HindIII-restricted pUC19NLSII, a plasmid that encodes the HA epitope linked in-frame to two copies of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptide of SV40 large T antigen. This results in in-frame fusion of HA and NLS sequences at the N-terminal end of FLI[R337,340L]. After release by EcoRI(partial) + HindIII digestion, the fragment encoding HA-(NLS)2-FLI-1[R337,340L] was cloned into the EcoRI + HindIII-restricted pBS and the SV40 early promoter-based ΔEB expression plasmid (13.Bailly R. Bosselut R. Zucman J. Cormier F. Delattre O. Roussel M. Thomas G. Ghysdael J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3230-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Mutants FLI-1[D344V], FLI-1[Y341V], and FLI-1[I347E] were generated by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange kit, Stratagene) using the pBS-wtFLI-1 as matrix and the following of mutagenic primers: 5′-CCTCCGTTATTACTATGTTAAAAACATTATGACC-3′/5′-GGTCATAATGTTTTTAACATAGTAATAACGGAGG-3′; 5′-GCCGGGCCCTCCGTGTTTACTATGATAAAAAC-3′/5′-GTTTTTATCATAGTAAACACGGAGGGCCCGGC-3′; and 5′-CGTTATTACTATGATAAAAACGAAATGACCAAAGTGCACGGC-3′/5′-GCCGTGCACTTTGGTCATTTCGTTTTTATCATAGTAATAACG-3′, respectively. To generate the ETS domain swapping mutants, the 658-bp EcoRI/HindIII FLI-1 fragment was subcloned into EcoRI + HindIII-restricted replication form of M13mp18. The corresponding single-stranded phage DNA was used as matrix to introduce a BamHI restriction site at position 840 of the wtFLI-1 cDNA (coordinated as in Ref. 10.Delattre O. Zucman J. Plougastel B. Desmaze C. Melot T. Peter M. Kovar H. Joubert I. de Jong P. Rouleau G. Aurias A. Thomas G. Nature. 1992; 359: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar) and AatII restriction sites at either position 938 or 1082 or 1037 + 1082 using the site-directed mutagenesis kit from Amersham Biosciences. The following mutagenic primers were used: 5′-CACAGCTGGATCCGCCCGCTTCC-3′ (BamHI 840); 5′-GCCACCTCATCGACGTCCGTCATT-3′ (AatII 938); 5′-GCACTTTGGTCATGACGTCTTTATCATAGTAATAAC-3′ (AatII 1037); and 5′-CAATGCCGTGGACGTCAAATTTGTAAGC-3′ (AatII 1082). The three mutagenized fragments were subcloned into EcoRI + HindIII-restricted pBS to generate the cloning intermediates pBS-FLI-1mut1, pBS-FLI-1mut2, and pBS-FLI-1mut3, respectively. To construct pBS-FLI-1[EEE] and pBS-FLI-1[PPP], the regions encoding the ETS domain of ETS-1 (amino acid residues 335-414) and PU.1 (amino acid residues 170-252), respectively, were PCR-amplified using 5′-CGGGATCCAGCTATGGCAGTTTCTTCTGG-3′ as 5′-primer and 5′-CGGACGTCAAAGCGGTACACGTAGCG-3′ as 3′-primer (ETS-1); 5′-CGGGATCCGCCTGTACCAGTTCC-3′ as 5′-primer, and 5′-CGGACGTCGAACTGGTAGGTGAGTTTC-3′ as 3′-primer (PU.1). This resulted in the bordering of each PCR-amplified fragment by BamHI and AattII restriction sites at their 5′ and 3′ extremity, respectively. The respective BamHI + AatII-digested PCR fragments were inserted in the BamHI + AatII-pBs-FLI-1mut2. The mutagenized inserts were released by EcoRI + HindIII digestion and subcloned in the EcoRI + HindIII-restricted pBS-wtFLI-1. These plasmids encode FLI-1 proteins in which the ETS domain of FLI-1 is changed for that of ETS-1 in FLI-1[EEE] or that of PU.1 in FLI-1[PPP]. Of note, these proteins contain two mutations at both sides of the ETS domain, namely Q280R and F362V (wtFLI-1 coordinates). These mutations were found to have no effect on the transforming properties of wtFLI-1 in erythroblasts. 2S. Ano, R. Pereira, M. Pironin, I. Lesault, C. Milley, I. Lebigot, C. T. Quang, and J. Ghysdael, unpublished observations. To construct pBS-FLI-1[PFF], the cDNA fragment encoding amino acid residues 170-204 of the PU.1 ETS domain was PCR-amplified, using 5′-CGGGATCCGCCTGTACCAGTTCC-3′ as 5′-primer and 5′-CGGACGTCTTGGACGAGAACTGGAAGG-3′ as 3′-primer. The resulting fragment was digested with BamHI + AatII and subcloned into BamHI + AatII-restricted pBS-FLI-1mut1. To construct pBS-FLI-1[FFP], the cDNA fragment encoding amino acid residues 241-252 of the PU.1 ETS domain, obtained by annealing the in vitro synthesized complementary oligonucleotides 5′-CGTCAAGAAGGTGAAGAAGAAGCTCACCTACCAGTTCGACGT-3′ and 5′-CGAACTGGTAGGTGAGCTTCTTCTTCACCTTCTTGACGACG-3′, was subcloned into AatII-restricted pBS-FLI-1mut3. In both FLI-1[PFF] and FLI-1[FFP], all AatII restriction enzyme sites were back-mutated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) to recover the wild type FLI-1 sequence at these positions, using the following primers: 5′-CCAGTTCTCGTCCAAGGACCCCGATGAGGTGGCCAGG-3′/5′-CCTGGCCACCTCATCGGGGTCCTTGGACGAGAACTGG-3′ (position 938 in FLI-1[PFF]); 5′-CCGTTATTACTATGATAAAAACATTGTCAAGAAGGTGAAGAAG-3′/5′-CTTCTTCACCTTCTTGACAATGTTTTTATCATAGTAATAACGG-3′ (position 1037 in FLI-1[FFP]); and 5′-GCTCACCTACCAGTTCGACTTCCACGGCATTGCCCAGGC-3′/5′-GCCTGGGCAATGCCGTGGAAGTCGAACTGGTAGGTGAGC-3′ (position 1085 in FLI-1[FFP]). The respective inserts were retrieved by EcoRI + HindIII digestion and subcloned into the EcoRI + HindIII-restricted pBS-wtFLI-1. Both FLI-1[PFF] and FLI-1[FFP] contain the Q280R mutation. To generate the corresponding ΔEB expression vector derivatives, mutagenized FLI-1 inserts were retrieved by XhoI + HindIII digestion and subcloned into XhoI + HindIII-restricted ΔEB-HA (29.Rabault B. Ghysdael J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28143-28151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This results in the N-terminal tagging of FLI-1 mutants with the HA epitope. To generate pSFCV derivatives, the EcoRI + HindIII cDNA inserts of ΔEB-HA derivatives were subcloned into EcoRI + HindIII-restricted pCla12 to border them with ClaI restriction enzyme sites. The respective inserts were retrieved by ClaI digestion and inserted into ClaI-restricted pSFCV. The expression plasmids ΔEB-FLI-1[225-452], ΔEB-FLI-1[276 - 373], SFCV-FLI-1[225-452], and SFCV-FLI-1[276-373] have been described previously (27.Lesault I. Quang C.T. Frampton J. Ghysdael J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 694-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To generate pBS-FLI-1[225-452], the BglII-digested insert obtained from Cla12-FLI-1[225-452] (27.Lesault I. Quang C.T. Frampton J. Ghysdael J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 694-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was subcloned into BamHI-restricted pBS. To generate pBS-FLI-1[276-373], the insert obtained from EcoRI + HindIII digestion of ΔEB-FLI-1[276-373] was subcloned into the EcoRI + HindIII-restricted pBS. To generate ΔEB-FLI-1[1-373] and SFCV-FLI-1[1-373], the corresponding region of the FLI-1 cDNA was PCR-amplified, using pBS-wtFLI-1 as matrix and 5′-GCCTCGAGGGACGGGACTATTAAGGAGG-3′ as 5′-primer and 5′-CCAAGCTTCTACGGATGTGGCTGCAGAGCC-3′ as 3′-primer. The XhoI + HindIII-digested PCR fragment encoding FLI-1[1-373] was subcloned into similarly digested pCla12 and ΔEB-HA. To generate pBS-FLI-1[1-373] and pSFCV-FLI-1[1-373], pCla12-FLI-1[1-373] was digested with ClaI and the insert subcloned into ClaI-restricted pBS and pSFCV, respectively. To generate the ΔEB-VP16/FLI-1[276-373] expression plasmid, the cDNA fragment encoding the transcriptional activation domain of VP16 was PCR-amplified using pcDNA3-FLI-1-VP16 (pAS1005) as matrix, as described previously (30.Dalgleish P. Sharrocks A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 560-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and 5′-CCCTCGAGCGATGTCAGCCTGGGGGACGAGCTCC-3′ as 5′-primer and 5′-GGCCTCGAGCGCCCACCGTACTCGTCAATTCC-3′ as 3′-primer. The XhoI-digested PCR fragment was cloned into XhoI-restricted ΔEB-FLI1 (276-373). This results in the in-frame fusion of the HA-tagged VP16 transactivation domain to FLI-1[276-373]. To generate pSFCV-VP16/FLI-1[276-373], the EcoRI + HindIII insert was subcloned into EcoRI + HindIII-restricted pCla12 to border it with ClaI restriction enzyme sites. The insert was retrieved by ClaI digestion and inserted into ClaI-restricted pSFCV. The inserts of all FLI-1 mutants were resequenced completely to verify for the presence of the expected mutations and the absence of unwanted mutations.

Cell Culture, Retroviral-mediated Gene Transfer, and Differentiation Assays—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 1 mm glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Chicken embryo fibroblasts were grown in the same medium supplemented with 2% chicken serum (Sigma). Infectious avian retroviruses were generated by co-transfection of primary chicken embryo fibroblasts with the replication-competent pRCAS-mEpoR and the different pSFCV retroviral vector derivatives and infected cells selected by their resistance to G418 (Invitrogen). To generate primary erythroblasts, chicken bone marrow cells were doubly infected with the S13 virus, encoding the temperature-sensitive ts-v-Sea protein kinase (34.Knight J. Zenke M. Disela C. Kowenz E. Vogt P. Engel J. Hayman M. Beug H. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) together with the different SFCV/R-CAS-EpoR viral stocks as described previously (28.Tran Quang C. Wessely O. Pironin M. Beug H. Ghysdael J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5639-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Infected bone marrow cells were seeded in CFU-E-methocel supplemented with 100 ng/ml recombinant chicken SCF, 1.4 nm insulin (Novo-Nordik), and 2.7 mg/ml G418. Under these conditions, only G418-resistant and transduced erythroblasts form colonies within 5-6 days at 37 °C. Erythroblast colonies were picked and expanded in CFU-E medium containing SCF and insulin. Differentiation analyses were performed as described previously (28.Tran Quang C. Wessely O. Pironin M. Beug H. Ghysdael J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5639-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To check for expression of the expected exogenous proteins, Western blots were performed using anti-EpoR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-697), anti-FLI-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-356), anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-805), anti-ERK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-154), and an anti-pan-ETS monoclonal antibody (kindly provided by N. K. Bhat, Frederick, MD). Transient Tranfections, Luciferase Assays, and Immunofluorescence Analyses—For transactivation experiments, 2.5 × 105 HeLa cells were plated in 6-well plates and transfected 24 h later with the indicated amount of plasmid DNA using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) in the absence of serum, as recommended by the manufacturer. The DNA mixture included the indicated amounts of reporter gene constructs and expression plasmids. The total amount of expression plasmid was kept constant by the addition of empty ΔEB vector, and the total amount of DNA was kept constant to 1 μg by the addition of carrier plasmid DNA. Cell lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity by using the luciferase assay system kit (Promega). The results shown are the mean of at least four independent transfections experiments. Immunofluorescence analyses were performed using HeLa cells transfected with 5 μg of the indicated expression plasmids. Two days after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized by incubation in 0.3% Triton X-100 10 min. After incubation for 1 h with a 1:200 dilution in PBS, 10% fetal calf serum of anti-HA antibody, cells were washed in PBS and incubated with a 1:100 dilution in PBS, 10% fetal calf serum of a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Amersham Biosciences) and nuclei were stained by Hoechst. After several PBS washes and dehydration, coverslips were mounted in Mowiol. Fluorescence was visualized with an epifluorescence microscope. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (13.Bailly R. Bosselut R. Zucman J. Cormier F. Delattre O. Roussel M. Thomas G. Ghysdael J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3230-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), using in vitro transcribed/translated wtFLI-1 and derived mutant proteins produced in reticulocyte lysate (TnT T7/T3 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System, Promega). The sequence of the EBSs double-stranded oligonucleotide used as probes and competitors (plus strand) are as follows: oligonucleotide A, 5′-TCGGGTCGACATAACCGGAAGTGGGC-3′; oligonucleotide T, 5′-TCGGGTCGACATAACCGGATGTGGGC-3′; Pu box, 5′-TCGGGTCGACTGAAAGAGGAACTTGGTC-3′; ERR1, 5′-TCGGGTCGACTCGACCTCCGGGAAGCCACCAAGAACCACCCATTTCCTCCCCATGTTTC-3′. The mutant Am oligonucleotide is identical to oligonucleotide A except for a GG to CC transversion in its core: 5′-TCGGTCACATAACCCCAAGTGGGC-3′. Core sequences are underlined. RT-PCR Analyses—Total RNA was prepared from erythroblasts maintained for 24 h at 42 °C using the guanidinium isothiocyanate lysis method and phenol extraction (35.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62899) Google Scholar). Total RNA samples were analyzed for the expression of specific genes by RT-PCR. cDNAs were synthesized using the First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences) using the manufacturer's NotI-(dT)18 primers. The generated cDNA products were amplified using Taq polymerase and the following primers: ckBCL-2, 5′-AGGCTCAGGATGGTCTTC-3′ and 5′-TGGACAACATTGCCACCTGG-3′; ckSLAP, 5′-TTCCTTGTCAGTACGGCACA-3′ and 5′-TCTAAGTGCTCAACTTCCATT-3′; and ckINPP5P, 5′-GCCTTCTTTTTCAATGAC-3′ and 5′-TCCACCTCAGAGATGTTCAA-3′. After 10 min at 94 °C, 30 amplification cycles (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 58 °C for BCL2, at 60 °C for SLAP, at 55 °C for INPP5P, 1 min at 72 °C) were performed, followed by a 10-min elongation step at 72 °C. PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. FLI-1 can regulate transcription either following its binding to specific DNA elements present in the enhancer/promoter regions of responsive genes or independently of DNA binding, through interactions in trans with other transcriptional regulators. To investigate the relative importance of these mechanisms to the transforming properties of FLI-1, a series of FLI-1 mutants were generated and characterized for their DNA binding, transcriptional regulatory properties, and transforming properties in erythroblasts. NMR studies have shown that the DNA binding domain (ETS domain) of FLI-1 is composed of three α-helices (α1-α3) and a four-stranded β-sheet (strands β1-β4) (36.Liang H. Mao X. Olejniczak E.T. Nettesheim D.G. Yu L. Meadows R.P. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); see Fig. 1). Helices α2 and α3 together with intervening residues form a helix-turn-helix motif that lies over the surface formed by the four-stranded β-sheet. Crystallographic studies have shown that residues from both the helix-turn-helix and β3-β4 motifs make direct contact with DNA and determine to a major extent the DNA binding specificity of ETS proteins (37.Kodandapani R. Pio F. Ni C. Picciali G. Klemsz M. McKercher S. Maki R. Ely K. Nature. 1996; 380: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 38.Mo Y. Vaessen B. Johnston K. Marmorstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 201-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Three point mutants in the ETS domain were constructed (see Fig. 1 for a schematic description of the mutants). In FLI-1[R337,340L], the arginine residues in helix α3 that make direct base contacts with the guanine residues of the EBS GGA core were mutated to leucine. This mutation has been shown previously to abolish the specific DNA binding activity of the isolated ETS domain of FLI-1 (36.Liang H. Mao X. Olejniczak E.T. Nettesheim D.G. Yu L. Meadows R.P. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and of EWS-FLI-1 (13.Bailly R. Bosselut R. Zucman J. Cormier F. Delattre O. Roussel M. Thomas G. Ghysdael J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3230-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In FLI-1[I347E], an isoleucine residu"
