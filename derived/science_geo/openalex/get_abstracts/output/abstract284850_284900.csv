https://openalex.org/W2090942757,"Carbon and oxygen isotope analysis through a 30-year (1944 to 1974) growth of Montastrea annularis from Hen and Chickens Reef (Florida Keys) shows a strong yearly variation in the abundances of both carbon-13 and oxygen-18 and a broad inverse relationship between the two isotopes. Normal annual dense bands are formed during the summer and are characterized by heavy carbon and light oxygen. ""Stress bands"" are formed during particularly severe winters and are characterized by heavy carbon and heavy oxygen. The isotopic effect of Zooxanthellae metabolism dominates the temperature effect on the oxygen-18/oxygen-16 ratio. The isotopic results on the deep-sea solitary coral Bathypsammia tintinnabulum, where Zooxanthellae are nonexistent, indicates that the abundance of the heavy isotopes carbon-13 and oxygen-18 is inversely related to the growth rate, with both carbon and oxygen approaching equilibrium values with increasing skeletal age."

Steep tributaries flowing within the zones of bedrock weakness move large debris to the Colorado, forming the rapids. Accelerated flow through the rapids scours the deep pools that are located below them."
https://openalex.org/W2061032316,"The behavioral function of a pheromone released by males of the army-worm moth Pseudaletia unipuncta was investigated both in laboratory wind-tunnel experiments and in experiments with moth-baited traps in the field. Such male moth scents have been thought to act at close range as sexual stimulants for females of the same species. However, the only obvious effect of the P. unipuncta male pheromone was upon other males, decreasing their tendency to approach sexually receptive, pheromone-releasing females and to exhibit copulatory behavior when near those females. The adaptive significance of the male pheromone may be related to the increased reproductive efficiency that results if multiple males are prevented from competing for a single female."
https://openalex.org/W1992706624,A strain of Amoeba proteus has lost its ability to survive at temperatures above 26Â°C as a result of becoming dependent on endosymbiotic bacteria that are psychrophile-like. The observed temperature sensitivity develops in fewer than 200 host cell generations (18 months of culture) after the host cells are experimentally infected with the symbionts.
https://openalex.org/W2082948193,"The ""solar neutrino puzzle"" has been a challenge for almost 20 years, posing broad and fundamental questions about astrophysics and neutrino properties. This article sketches some of the ideas that have been put forward to solve the problem. These ideas can be grouped into two main classes: those involving changes in the standard solar model or in the basic nuclear reaction data, and those that attribute the puzzle to as yet unobserved properties of the neutrinos."
https://openalex.org/W1968436087,"This article discusses the new experiments, under way or proposed, that will measure the flux of solar neutrinos and so probe the ""solar neutrino puzzle."" Both radiochemical and electronic detector experiments are analyzed in terms of possible findings relevant to astrophysics and neutrino properties. Important elements are sensitivity to the principal components of the solar neutrino spectrum, directionality of the detector response, and an energy-measuring capability that might provide a unique identifying signal. Experiments beyond those currently under way will probably be needed, and development of real-time detectors is particularly important."

The simultaneous development of a regional monitoring network and legal instruments to protect the Mediterranean from pollution is an important achievement, which provides a firm basis for continuing cooperative efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2085731955,"Using high-resolution multibeam interference techniques in the transmission electron microscope, images have been obtained that make possible a real-space structure analysis of a beryllium-silicon-nitrogen compound. The results illustrate the usefulness of lattice imaging in the analysis of local crystal structure in these technologically promising ceramic materials."
https://openalex.org/W2059915490,"A proposed technological approach to meeting recognized nuclear power needs is a symbiotic combination of breeders and advanced converter reactors. Breeders, situated in secured areas, would be fueled with and self-sufficient in plutonium. The excess fuel produced in the breeder would be uranium-233, sufficient in quantity to supply several advanced converters located near load centers. This approach is suggested as a balanced way to meet important criteria applicable to the continued development of nuclear power."

https://openalex.org/W2059180602,"The current state and future directions of the U.S. space-science program are assessed in the wake of the Challenger accident, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget reduction act, and the report of the National Commission on Space. A renewed emphasis on moderate-scale, quick-response missions will be of special importance for scientific progress and will compensate in part for the postponement of most major space missions. Satellites and manned space stations in Earth orbit, along with unmanned planetary missions, will continue to be the dominant elements in the space program. Future progress and the continuation of U.S. leadership depend on the vitality of U.S. space research."
