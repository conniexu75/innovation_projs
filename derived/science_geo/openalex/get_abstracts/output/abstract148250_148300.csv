https://openalex.org/W2090194040,"Metastatic progression of most common epithelial tumors involves a heterogeneous, transient loss of expression of the homotypic cell adhesion protein, E-cadherin, rather than the uniform loss of a functional protein resulting from coding region mutation. Indeed, whereas E-cadherin loss may promote invasion, reexpression may facilitate cell survival within metastatic deposits. The mechanisms underlying such plasticity are unclear. We now show that the heterogeneous loss of E-cadherin expression in primary human breast cancers reflects a heterogeneous pattern of promoter region methylation, which begins early prior to invasion. In cultured human tumor cells, such heterogeneous methylation is dynamic, varying from allele to allele and shifting in relation to the tumor microenvironment. Following invasion in vitro, which favors diminished E-cadherin expression, the density of promoter methylation markedly increased. When these cells were cultured as spheroids, which requires homotypic cell adhesion, promoter methylation decreased dramatically, and E-cadherin was reexpressed. These data show that the methylation associated with E-cadherin loss in human breast cancer is heterogeneous and unstable and suggest that such epigenetic plasticity may contribute to the dynamic, phenotypic heterogeneity that drives metastatic progression."

(1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 15181–15185). In the present study, the involvement of Mrp3 in the transport of endogenous bile salts was investigated using membrane vesicles from LLC-PK1 cells transfected with rat Mrp3 cDNA. The ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]taurocholate (TC), [14C]glycocholate (GC), [3H]taurochenodeoxycholate-3-sulfate (TCDC-S), and [3H]taurolithocholate-3-sulfate (TLC-S) was markedly stimulated by Mrp3 transfection in LLC-PK1 cells. The extent of Mrp3-mediated transport of bile salts was in the order, TLC-S > TCDC-S > TC > GC. The K m andV max values for the uptake of TC and TLC-S wereK m = 15.9 ± 4.9 μm andV max = 50.1 ± 9.3 pmol/min/mg of protein and K m = 3.06 ± 0.57 μm andV max = 161.9 ± 21.7 pmol/min/mg of protein, respectively. At 55 nm[3H]E217βG and 1.2 μm[3H]TC, the apparent K m values for ATP were 1.36 and 0.66 mm, respectively. TC, GC, and TCDC-S inhibited the transport of [3H]E217βG and [3H]TC to the same extent with an apparent IC50 of ∼10 μm. TLC-S inhibited the uptake of [3H]E217βG and [3H]TC most potently (IC50 of ∼1 μm) among the bile salts examined, whereas cholate weakly inhibited the uptake (IC50 ∼75 μm). Although TC and GC are transported by bile salt export pump/sister of P-glycoprotein, but not by MRP2, and TCDC-S and TLC-S are transported by MRP2, but not by bile salt export pump/sister of P-glycoprotein, it was found that Mrp3 accepts all these bile salts as substrates. This information, together with the finding that MRP3 is extensively expressed on the basolateral membrane of human cholangiocytes, suggests that MRP3/Mrp3 plays a significant role in the cholehepatic circulation of bile salts.

Among MRP family proteins, the functions of MRP1 and MRP2, the latter being also referred to as canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (cMOAT), have been well characterized (3.Ishikawa T.

Using MRP1-transfected or MRP1-overexpressing cells, substrates for MRP1 have been shown to include glutathione conjugates (e.g. 2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione and leukotriene C4), glucuronide conjugates (e.g. 17β-estradiol 17-β-d-glucuronide (E217βG)), and sulfate conjugates of certain bile salts (e.g. taurolithocholate-3-sulfate) (3.Ishikawa T.

Studies with mutant rats whose cMOAT/Mrp2 activity is hereditarily defective (e.g. transport-deficient rats and Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rats (EHBR)) have shown that the substrate specificity of Mrp2 is very similar to that of MRP1 (6.Oude Elferink R.P.

Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1062-1067PubMed Google Scholar).Rat Mrp3, initially referred to as MRP-like protein 2, has been cloned from the liver of cMOAT/MRP2-deficient rats (EHBR) as an inducible protein under cholestatic conditions (15.Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Ito K. Ogawa K. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1068-1075PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Königet al. (16.König J. Rost D. Cui Y. Keppler D. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) showed that MRP3 is located on the basolateral membrane of human hepatocytes with exceptionally high expression in the livers of patients whose cMOAT/MRP2 function is deficient (Dubin-Johnson syndrome) and from a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis. In addition, Kool et al. (17.Kool M. van der Linden M. de Haas M. Scheffer G.L. de Vree J.M. Smith A.J. Jansen G. Peters G.J. Ponne N. Scheper R.J. Oude Elferink R.P. Baas F. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It may be plausible that MRP3/Mrp3 compensates for the impaired function of cMOAT/MRP2 in the liver. In addition, because Northern blot analysis indicated the extensive expression of MRP3/Mrp3 in intestinal tissues of humans and rats, it is possible that MRP3/Mrp3 is also responsible for the intestinal transport of organic anions (2.Kool M. de Haas M. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. van Eijk M.J. Juijn J.A. Baas F. Borst P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3537-3547PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Ito K. Ogawa K. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y.

Hirohashi T. Tyson C.A. Sugiyama Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Our recent findings are consistent with this hypothesis. Recently, we demonstrated that rat Mrp3 mediates the transport of some organic anions, including glucuronides (e.g. E217βG) and methotrexate (19.Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15181-15185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Moreover, the substrate specificity of Mrp3 was shown to differ markedly from that of MRP1 and cMOAT/MRP2 in that glutathione conjugates (e.g. 2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione and leukotriene C4) are poor substrates for Mrp3 (19.Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15181-15185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar).In the present study, we examined whether bile salts, another class of organic anions, are transported via Mrp3 to identify further physiological substrates for Mrp3. At present, at least two different pathways for the biliary excretion of bile salts have been reported (6.Oude Elferink R.P. Meijer D.K.F. Kuipers F. Jansen P.L.M. Groen A.K. Groothuis G.M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 215-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar); non-sulfated bile salts such as taurocholate (TC), cholate (CA), and glycocholate (GC) are transported via bile salt export pump/sister of P-glycoprotein (BSEP/spgp) (20.Gerloff T. Stieger B. Hagenbuch B. Madon J. Landmann L. Roth J. Hofmann A.F. Meier P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10046-10050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar), whereas in vivo studies suggest that the biliary excretion of sulfated bile salts such as taurochenodeoxycholate-3-sulfate (TCDC-S) and taurolithocholate-3-sulfate (TLC-S) is mediated by cMOAT/Mrp2 (21.Kuipers F. Enserink M. Havinga R. van der Steen A.B. Hardonk M.J. Fevery J. Vonk R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The transport studies using membrane vesicles prepared from rat Mrp3-transfected LLC-PK1 cells have enabled us to show that both non-sulfated and sulfated bile salts are physiological substrates for Mrp3.DISCUSSIONWe have previously shown that rat Mrp3 is a primary active transporter for several organic anions (19.Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15181-15185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Although Mrp3 recognizes glucuronide conjugates as good substrates, the substrate specificity of Mrp3 is in marked contrast to that of MRP1 and cMOAT/MRP2 in that glutathione conjugates are poor substrates for Mrp3 (19.Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15181-15185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the transport of bile salts via rat Mrp3 to investigate the physiological substrates for this transporter by using membrane vesicles prepared from LLC-PK1 transfected with cloned rat Mrp3 cDNA.Cumulative evidence indicated that MRP1 and cMOAT/MRP2 mediate the transport of glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of bile salts but not monovalent bile salts (5.Keppler D. König J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 6.Oude Elferink R.P. Meijer D.K.F. Kuipers F. Jansen P.L.M. Groen A.K. Groothuis G.M.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Leier I. Buchholz U. Barnouin K. Kurz G. Keppler D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 988-994PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, several in vivo results suggest that glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of bile salts are extruded into the bile with the aid of Mrp2; the biliary excretion of intravenously administered 3α-sulfates of taurochenodeoxycholate, taurolithocholate and glycolithocholate (21.Kuipers F.

Invest. 1988; 81: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and 3-O-glucuronides of cholate and lithocholate (30.Kuipers F. Radominska A. Zimniak P. Little J.M. Havinga R. Vonk R.J. Lester R. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1835-1845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was impaired in GY/transport-deficient rats compared with control rats. A similar phenomenon has been also reported in EHBR (31.Takikawa H. Sano N. Narita T. Uchida Y. Yamanaka M. Horie T. Mikami T. Tagaya O. Hepatology. 1991; 14: 352-360PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we have provided direct evidence that both TLC-S and TCDC-S are substrates for cMOAT/Mrp2; the ATP-dependent transport of these sulfated bile salts was observed in isolated bile canalicular membrane vesicles (CMVs) from SD rats, but not from EHBR (40.Akita H. Sato N. Kinoshita S. Suzuki H. Takikawa H. Goto J. Iida T. Sugiyama Y. Hepatology. 1999; 30, (suppl.): 1480Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been demonstrated that the transport of monovalent bile salts across the bile canalicular membrane is mediated by BSEP/spgp (28.Müller M. Ishikawa T. Berger U. Klunemann C. Lucka L. Schreyer A. Kannicht C. Reutter W. Kurz G. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18920-18926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Stieger B. O'Neill B. Meier P.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This conclusion is based on the finding that the transport activity of monovalent bile salts is comparable between normal and Mrp2-deficient rats (21.Kuipers F. Enserink M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10046-10050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar) demonstrated that spgp, which shows higher homology with MDR1 rather than the MRP family, is endowed with the BSEP function. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, Mrp3 exhibits a unique ability to transport bile salts; the ATP-dependent uptake of both monovalent (TC and GC) and sulfated (TLC-S and TCDC-S) bile salts was markedly stimulated by Mrp3 transfection in LLC-PK1 cells. Kinetic analysis revealed that the K m value of TLC-S for Mrp3 was 3.1 μm in Mrp3-transfected LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 4), indicating that Mrp3 has also similar high affinity for TLC-S as observed for cMOAT/MRP2 in CMVs (0.9 μm) (40.Akita H. Sato N. Kinoshita S. Suzuki H. Takikawa H. Goto J. Iida T. Sugiyama Y. Hepatology. 1999; 30, (suppl.): 1480Google Scholar). The ATP-dependent transport of TC was also saturable (K m = 15.9 μm) (Fig. 4) withK m values severalfold higher than those determined in CMVs (2.1 μm) (32.Stieger B. O'Neill B. Meier P.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and membrane vesicles from Sf9 cells expressing BSEP/spgp (5.5 μm) (20.Gerloff T. Stieger B. Hagenbuch B. Madon J. Landmann L. Roth J. Hofmann A.F. Meier P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10046-10050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). TheK m value for ATP determined by measuring the Mrp3-mediated transport of [3H]E217βG (1.36 mm) (Fig. 5) was in a similar range with that of human MRP1 (0.39 mm) (33.Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9683-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), rat cMOAT/Mrp2 (0.26 mm) (34.Kobayashi K. Sogame Y. Hara H. Hayashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7737-7741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and rabbit cMOAT/Mrp2 (0.62 mm) (14.van Aubel R.A. van Kuijck M.A. Koenderink J.B. Deen P.M. van Os C.H. Russel F.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1062-1067PubMed Google Scholar).We also determined the mutual inhibitory effect between bile salts and E217βG in membrane vesicles expressing Mrp3 (Table I). The inhibitory effect of E217βG on the ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]TC was minimal even at 75 μm (Table I), consistent with the previous result that Mrp3 has a low affinity (K m = 110 μm) for E217βG in cDNA-transfected LLC-PK1 cells (19.Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15181-15185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Although all the monovalent bile salts (TC, CA, and GC) examined in the present study inhibited the transport of [3H]E217βG and [3H]TC, the inhibitory effect of CA (IC50 ∼ 20–75 μm) was less marked than that of TC and GC (IC50 ∼ 10 μm). The fact that the ATP-dependent transport of CA was not significantly stimulated by Mrp3 transfection (data not shown) may be accounted for by the less efficient transport of CA due to the low affinity. The same phenomena have been observed for the BSEP/spgp-mediated transport of CA (20.Gerloff T. Stieger B. Hagenbuch B. Madon J. Landmann L. Roth J. Hofmann A.F. Meier P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10046-10050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The efficiency of the transport of CA is much less than that of TC in CMVs due to the low affinity (K m = 84 μm), 2N. Sato, H. Suzuki, H. Takikawa, J. Goto, T. Iida, and Y. Sugiyama, unpublished observation. and in addition, no significant effect of spgp transfection was observed in membrane vesicles from Sf9 cells (20.Gerloff T. Stieger B. Hagenbuch B. Madon J. Landmann L. Roth J. Hofmann A.F. Meier P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10046-10050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). TLC-S potently inhibited the transport of [3H]E217βG and [3H]TC at lower concentrations (Table I), consistent with its high affinity to Mrp3, as discussed in the previous paragraph. The less inhibition potency of TCDC-S compared with that of TLC-S also agreed with our recent findings for cMOAT/Mrp2; in CMVs, theK m value for TCDC-S (8.8 μm) was significantly higher than that for TLC-S (0.9 μm) (40.Akita H. Sato N. Kinoshita S. Suzuki H. Takikawa H. Goto J. Iida T. Sugiyama Y. Hepatology. 1999; 30, (suppl.): 1480Google Scholar).We previously found that Mrp3 is expressed in the liver of EHBR, whose cMOAT/Mrp2 function is hereditarily defective, but not in the liver of normal SD rats (15.Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Ito K. Ogawa K. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1068-1075PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of Mrp3 is induced in SD rat liver by phenobarbital treatment and by treatment, which increases the plasma bilirubin concentration and/or its glucuronide (e.g.cholestasis induced by common bile duct ligation and by α-naphthylisothiocyanate treatment) (41.Ogawa, K., Suzuki, H., Hirohashi, T., Ishikawa, T., Meier, P. J., Hirose, K., Akizawa, T., Yoshioka, M. and Sugiyama, Y. (2000) Am. J. Physiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). These results are in accordance with immunohistochemical studies showing high expression of MRP3 in human liver specimens from patients whose cMOAT/MRP2 function is deficient (Dubin-Johnson syndrome) and from a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis compared with normal liver samples (16.König J. Rost D. Cui Y. Keppler D. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Considering that MRP3 is located on the basolateral membrane of human hepatocytes (16.König J.

A. 1999; 96: 6914-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), it is possible that MRP3/Mrp3 may play an important role in protecting hepatocytes from endogenous bile salts by extruding them from hepatocytes into the blood. In bile-duct ligated rat liver, down-regulation of Na+/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, a transporter responsible for the Na+-dependent uptake of bile salts into hepatocytes, has been reported (35.Gartung C. Ananthanarayanan M. Rahman M.A. Schuele S. Nundy S. Soroka C.J. Stolz A. Suchy F.J. Boyer J.L. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 199-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The down-regulation of Na+/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide and up-regulation of Mrp3 may be regarded as a regulatory mechanism to reduce the intrahepatic concentration of bile salts. In addition, because the expression of MRP3 on the (baso)lateral membrane of cholangiocytes has been postulated 3K. Oda, J. Shoda, T. Hirohashi, H. Suzuki, and Y. Sugiyama, unpublished observation. (17.Kool M. van der Linden M. de Haas M. Scheffer G.L. de Vree J.M. Smith A.J. Jansen G. Peters G.J. Ponne N. Scheper R.J. Oude Elferink R.P. Baas F. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6914-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), it is possible that MRP3, together with apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter expressed in these intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells (36.Lazaridis K.N. Pham L. Tietz P. Marinelli R.A. deGroen P.C. Levine S. Dawson P.A. LaRusso N.F. J. Clin.

Hirohashi T. Tyson C.A. Sugiyama Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). By using antiserum against human MRP3, we could detect MRP3 on the basolateral membrane of small intestinal epithelial cells in humans.3Although the localization of Mrp3 in rat small intestine still remains to be clarified, it is possible that Mrp3 is also expressed on the basolateral membrane of these epithelial cells in rats. Although numerous studies have suggested that several kinds of transporters on the brush border membrane mediate the intestinal uptake of bile salts (reviewed in Ref. 38.Love M.W. Dawson P.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), little is known about the basolateral secretion of bile salts. There is only a report by Weinberg et al.(39.Weinberg S.L. Burckhardt G. Wilson F.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which indicated the presence of sodium-independent organic anion exchange protein using basolateral membrane vesicles. It may be that Mrp3 plays a role in the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts by transporting them from enterocytes into circulating blood. Further studies on the role of Mrp3 in intestinal tissues will provide us with new insights into the mechanism of enterohepatic circulation of bile salts.In conclusion, we demonstrated that not only sulfated bile salts (TCDC-S and TLC-S) but also monovalent bile salts (TC and GC) are good substrates for rat Mrp3. The substrate specificity of Mrp3 is in marked contrast to that of MRP1 and cMOAT/MRP2, in that monovalent bile salts are not significantly transported by MRP1 and cMOAT/MRP2. It is possible that Mrp3 acts as an inducible transporter to compensate for the reduced function of cMOAT/MRP2 and/or BSEP/spgp and extrudes bile salts into the blood. In addition, Mrp3 may be involved in the cholehepatic and enterohepatic circulation by extruding bile salts from cholangiocytes and enterocytes, respectively, into the blood. Since the initial cloning of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1)1 as a transporter that confers multidrug resistance by providing cells with the ability to extrude anticancer drugs was reported in 1992 (1.Cole S.P. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M. Deeley R.G.

Among MRP family proteins, the functions of MRP1 and MRP2, the latter being also referred to as canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (cMOAT), have been well characterized (3.Ishikawa T.

Using MRP1-transfected or MRP1-overexpressing cells, substrates for MRP1 have been shown to include glutathione conjugates (e.g. 2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione and leukotriene C4), glucuronide conjugates (e.g. 17β-estradiol 17-β-d-glucuronide (E217βG)), and sulfate conjugates of certain bile salts (e.g. taurolithocholate-3-sulfate) (3.Ishikawa T.

Studies with mutant rats whose cMOAT/Mrp2 activity is hereditarily defective (e.g. transport-deficient rats and Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rats (EHBR)) have shown that the substrate specificity of Mrp2 is very similar to that of MRP1 (6.Oude Elferink R.P.

In contrast, α-secretase cleaves APP within the Aβ sequence and precludes amyloidogenesis. Regulated and unregulated α-secretase activities have been reported, and the fraction of cellular α-secretase activity regulated by protein kinase C (PKC) has been attributed to the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family members TACE and ADAM-10. Although unregulated α-secretase cleavage of APP has been shown to occur at the cell surface, we sought to identify the intracellular site of PKC-regulated α-secretase APP cleavage. To accomplish this, we measured levels of secreted ectodomains and C-terminal fragments of APP generated by α-secretase (sAPPα) (C83) versus β-secretase (sAPPβ) (C99) and secreted Aβ in cultured cells treated with PKC and inhibitors of TACE/ADAM-10. We found that PKC stimulation increased sAPPα but decreased sAPPβ levels by altering the competition between α- versus β-secretase for APP within the same organelle rather than by perturbing APP trafficking. Moreover, data implicating the trans-Golgi network (TGN) as a major site for β-secretase activity prompted us to hypothesize that PKC-regulated α-secretase(s) also reside in this organelle. To test this hypothesis, we performed studies demonstrating proteolytically mature TACE intracellularly, and we also showed that regulated α-secretase APP cleavage occurs in the TGN using an APP mutant construct targeted specifically to the TGN.

The amyloidogenic amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) fragment is generated through an initial APP cleavage by β-secretase(s) to define the NH2 terminus of Aβ. This cleavage generates sAPPβ, a secreted ectodomain of APP, and C99, the 99-amino acid C-terminal fragment that contains the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of APP. C99 is further cleaved by γ-secretase(s), releasing the Aβ peptide, which is either 40 or 42 amino acids long (i.e. Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42; reviewed in Ref. 1.Selkoe D.J. Rosenberg R.N. Prusiner S.B. DiMauro S. Barchi R.L. The Molecular and Genetic Basis of Neurological Disease. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston1997: 601-612Google Scholar). Because the majority of secreted Aβ appears to be generated in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), this is likely to be a major locus for β- and γ-secretase activities (2.Xu H. Sweeney D. Wang R. Thinakaran G. Lo A.C. Sisodia S.S. Greengard P. Gandy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3748-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In contrast to secreted Aβ, intracellular Aβ1–42 is generated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/intermediate compartment (IC) (3.Cook D.G. Forman M.S. Sung J.C. Leight S. Kolson D.L. Iwatsubo T.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This suggests that both β-secretase and an Aβ1–42generating γ-secretase are also active in the ER/IC. In addition to the TGN and ER/IC amyloidogenic processing pathways, APP can be processed by α-secretase, which cleaves APP at position 16 within the Aβ domain to generate sAPPα (the ectodomain of APP ending at the α-secretase cleavage site) and C83 (the 83-amino acid COOH-tail of APP). γ-Secretase cleavage of C83 does not produce Aβ but generates a 3-kDa fragment composed of residues 17–40 or 17–42 of the Aβ peptide (p3). This pathway is thought to be nonamyloidogenic and may not contribute substantially to AD pathology (1.Selkoe D.J. Rosenberg R.N. Prusiner S.B. DiMauro S. Barchi R.L. The Molecular and Genetic Basis of Neurological Disease. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston1997: 601-612Google Scholar). Cell surface radioiodination experiments have shown that α-secretase cleavage of APP can occur at the plasma membrane (7.Sisodia S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6075-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Because the proportion of APP processed by β-secretaseversus α-secretase may affect the amount of Aβ produced, the regulation of these two pathways may be critically important to the pathogenesis of AD. Indeed, mutations in APP found in a Swedish familial AD pedigree map to the β-secretase cleavage site in APP and favor β-secretase cleavage of APP (8.Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L.

Med. 1996; 2: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). Thus, cells expressing these mutations secrete increased amounts of Aβ and decreased amounts of p3 as compared with cells expressing wild-type APP. In contrast to the Swedish mutation, which increases β-secretase cleavage, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) has been shown to favor α-secretase cleavage at the expense of β-secretase cleavage. For example, treatment of cells with the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) increases secretion of sAPPα and decreases secretion of Aβ (10.Caporaso G.L. Gandy S.E. Buxbaum J.D.

Transgenic mice engineered to produce high levels of human Aβ also have decreased levels of brain Aβ following PMA treatment, suggesting that stimulation of α-secretase cleavage may be a useful intervention in AD (12.Savage M.J.

TACE has been shown to cut APP at the α-secretase cleavage site in vitro, and inhibitors of TACE, such as tumor necrosis factor-α protease inhibitor (TAPI ((N-R-(2-hydroxyaminocarbonyl)methyl)-4-methylpentanoyl-l-naphthylalanyl-l-alanine 2-aminoethyl amide)) and IC-3, block PMA-stimulated secretion of sAPPα from cells. Furthermore, fibroblasts derived from TACE knockout mice generate lower levels of sAPPα, and fail to show any regulated sAPPα secretion (13.Buxbaum J.D. Liu K.N. Luo Y. Slack J.L. Stocking K.L.

The fact that TACE knockout cells and cells treated with TACE inhibitors still secrete some sAPPα (in the presence or absence of PKC activators) suggests that there may be multiple α-secretases involved in the cleavage of APP. Indeed, another closely related disintegrin metalloprotease, ADAM-10, can also cleave APP at the α-secretase site and may contribute to the cleavage of APP following phorbol ester stimulation (16.Lammich S.

Whereas these ADAM family members may account for the majority of PKC-regulated APP α-secretase cleavage (αreg), there is an additional constitutively active α-secretase activity that is PKC-independent and is not inhibited by disintegrin metalloprotease inhibitors (αunreg). Here, we examined the subcellular localizations of these two α-secretase cleavages and determined how activation of TACE/ADAM-10 further affects processing of APP by β- and γ-secretases.

To calibrate the sensitivity of the ELISA for detecting Aβ, synthetic Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 peptides (Bachem Bioscience Inc., King of Prussia, PA) were used to generate standard curves. The BAN50, BA-27, and BC-05 mAbs were prepared and characterized as described previously (20.Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D. Odaka A. Otvos L.J. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G.

CHO Pro 5 cells were lysed as described above. Proteins were resolved on 7.5% Tris-glycine gels and probed with a mAb raised against the catalytic domain of TACE or C-15 (goat polyclonal antiserum raised against the C-terminal domain of TACE; Santa Cruz). Anti-mouse or anti-goat HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were used followed by visualization with ECL. Cells were treated with and without PMA for 15 min. Cells were then treated with trypsin (10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline without calcium or magnesium) or with trypsin and 0.1% Triton X-100 on ice. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and lysed for Western blotting or immunoprecipitation as before. The effects of PMA and the ADAM protease inhibitor TAPI on sAPPα secretion were examined in CHO cells stably transfected with APP695 (CHO695). CHO695 cells express high levels of APP and constitutively secrete easily measurable amounts of sAPPα. As early as 15 min following PMA treatment, secretion of sAPPα was increased by approximately 3–5-fold (data not shown). The effects of PMA on sAPPα secretion were cumulative for approximately 1 h, but over longer time periods (3–5 h), this effect waned, and sAPPα secretion returned to baseline levels (data not shown). Therefore, we examined APP secretion during the first hour following PMA treatment by metabolically labeling CHO695 cells with [35S]methionine for 1 h followed by a chase in the presence or absence of PMA (Fig. 1,A and C). sAPPα was quantitatively immunoprecipitated and visualized on Tris-glycine gels. Addition of PMA induced sAPPα secretion by approximately 3-fold. However, the protease inhibitor TAPI abolished the PMA effect and even reduced sAPPα levels to below control levels, suggesting that TACE/ADAM-10-mediated cleavage of APP accounts not only for the PKC-regulated α-secretase activity (αreg) induced by PMA, but for much of the constitutive α-secretase activity as well. Because TAPI did not fully inhibit sAPPα release, another TAPI insensitive α-secretase may also cleave APP in both stimulated and unstimulated cells. To eliminate the possibility that the sAPPα recovered during the 1-h chase was produced prior to the addition of TAPI, TAPI was added as early as 1 h prior to PMA treatment. The effects of TAPI on APP secretion were maximal when TAPI was added 30 min prior to chase. No decrease in TAPI insensitive secretion was noted with longer pretreatments or higher concentrations of TAPI. If β-secretase activity were limited by the availability of APP, then increased cleavage of APP by other secretases (such as αreg) could decrease β-secretase cleavage of APP and hence Aβ production. To determine whether or not increased αreg led to reduced β-secretase activity, we examined the effects of PMA induced ADAM activity on β-secretion of APP, using an antibody that specifically recognizes sAPPβ for immunoprecipitation (18.Chyung A.C. Greenberg B.D. Cook D.G. Doms R.W. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Fig. 1, B and D, shows that PMA reduced secretion of sAPPβ by 23%. To determine whether activation of TACE/ADAM-10 was involved in the decreased secretion of sAPPβ, we tested the effects of TAPI on sAPPβ. As shown in Fig.1 B, TAPI pretreatment restored sAPPβ secretion to baseline levels. Increased αreg activity also reduced production of Aβ. CHO695 cells were treated with PMA and/or TAPI and levels of secreted Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 were quantitated by sandwich ELISA. Fig. 2shows that PMA decreased secretion of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 by 51 and 31%, respectively. In contrast, pretreatment with TAPI restored secretion of both Aβ isoforms to control levels. Taken together, these data suggest APP is a limiting substrate for which both αreg and the β-secretase activities compete. Furthermore, because enhanced αregcleavage of APP reduces both β- and γ-cleavage of APP, αreg-cleavage of APP must occur prior to or concomitant with β-secretase cleavage. The ability of TAPI and PMA to modulate the production of sAPPα, sAPPβ, and Aβ suggested that the αreg and β-secretases compete for limiting amounts of APP. If true, then PMA and TAPI should also affect the production of intracellular C-terminal fragments of APP produced by α- and β-secretases. CHO695 cells were labeled for 90 min followed by 45 min of chase in the presence or absence of PMA or TAPI. APP C-terminal fragments were immunoprecipitated with an antibody specific for the last 40 amino acids of APP (2493). As shown in Fig.3, lane 1, the products of α- and β-secretase cleavage (C83 and C99, respectively) were recovered at similar levels. In addition, a band corresponding to the last 89 amino acids of APP (C89) was recovered (as determined by radiosequence analysis), suggesting efficient cleavage of APP at residue 11 of Aβ in CHO cells. Following PMA treatment, levels of C99 and C89 decreased by 40%, whereas C83 levels increased 1.6-fold. Thus, changes in levels of intracellular C-terminal fragments of APP mirrored changes seen in sAPPα and sAPPβ levels, confirming that activation of PKC resulted in increased α-secretase cleavage of APP at the expense of β-secretase cleavage. Similar to secreted sAPPα, C83 levels were decreased by 46 ± 6% by TAPI. As before, TAPI pretreatment completely blocked the effects of PMA, decreasing C83 recovery by 53 ± 7% (Fig. 3, lane 4), eliminating the possibility that a non-metalloprotease-mediated event (such as a general effect of PMA on APP trafficking) is responsible for this effect. To test whether the C83 generated by αreg and constitutively generated C83 are both substrates for γ-secretase, we treated cells with MG132, which has been shown to inhibit the intracellular γ-secretase activity that produces Aβ1–40. As expected, MG132 treatment resulted in significantly increased recovery of C99, C89, and C83 (Fig. 3,lanes 5–8), indicating that all of these species can be turned over by a MG132-sensitive pathway, such as the Aβ1–40 producing γ-secretase. However, because MG132 is known to have other effects, such as proteasome inhibition, we cannot eliminate the possibility that these fragments are also turned over by other degradative processes. Interestingly, MG132 had similar effects on C83 levels in both unstimulated and PKC-stimulated cells, suggesting that C83 produced by αreg and αunreg are both turned over by a MG132-sensitive γ-secretase. Finally, TAPI pretreatment rescued C99 recovery to baseline levels in the presence of PMA, further supporting the hypothesis that that αreg competes with β-secretase for cleavage of APP. Because αreg-cleavage decreased β-secretase cleavage of APP, we hypothesized that αreg and β-secretase cleavage should either occur contemporaneously or sequentially, with αreg cleavage preceding β-secretase cleavage. Because steady-state labeling experiments cannot address the temporal sequence of α- and β-secretase cleavage of APP, we used a pulse-chase paradigm to test this hypothesis. To do this, CHOΔNLcells were pulse-labeled for 10 min in the presence or absence of PMA, and C-terminal APP intracellular fragments were immunoprecipitated at various time points during the chase period. Due to the low levels of C99 produced under these conditions, we used CHO cells that express the APPΔNL mutant, which is cleaved more efficiently than APPWT by β-secretase. As shown in Fig.4, C99 and C83 were made contemporaneously in the absence of PMA. PMA treatment shifted APP processing away from β-secretase cleavage and toward α-secretase cleavage (as evidenced by C83 accumulation at the expense of C99), although without altering the total level of C-terminal fragment generation. This argues against a PMA induced global alteration in APP processing (such as would be expected from alterations in APP trafficking) and supports direct competition between these secretases. Importantly, even with favored β-secretase cleavage of APP in CHOΔNL cells, C99 was not produced prior to C83, arguing against the possibility that PMA stimulation results in C99 turnover to C83. Because we established that αregcompetes with β-secretase to cleave APP and because β-secretase activities have been detected in the ER and the TGN, we sought to identify the site of αreg cleavage. To do this, we utilized two organelle-specific APP targeting constructs: APPΔKK and APPTGN. APPΔKK is an APP construct that has been modified to contain the dilysine ER retention motif; expression of APPΔKK in cells restricts APP to the ER/IC. APPTGN is an APP/furin hybrid that contains the extracellular and transmembrane domains of APP, fused to the cytoplasmic domain of rat furin. 2Chyung, A. C., Lee, V. M.-Y., and Doms, R. W., manuscript in preparation. The cytoplasmic domain of furin is sufficient for targeting furin to the TGN (22.Voorhees P. Deignan E., van, D.E. Humphrey J. Marks M.S. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4961-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and serves to target APPTGN to the TGN as well. CHO cells infected with SFV-APPWT, SFV-APPTGN, or SFV-APPΔKK were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h, pretreated with TAPI for 30 min, and chased with or without PMA for an additional 45 min. sAPPα was immunoprecipitated with 6E10, resolved on Tris-glycine gels, and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Fig.5 A). In order to standardize results for varying levels of SFV infection, sAPPα levels were normalized to levels of full-length APP (Fig. 5, B andC). As shown in Fig. 5 A, infection of cells with SFV-APPΔKK completely abrogated both constitutive and PMA-stimulated sAPPα secretion, suggesting a post-ER/IC locus for both α-secretases. In contrast, infection of cells with SFV-APPTGN resulted in a 49% decrease in sAPPα secretion as compared with cells infected with SFV-APPWT. This decrease could be due to increased β-secretase cleavage in the TGN because this is the major site that produced secreted Aβ. Alternatively, the decrease in sAPPα secretion could be explained if the constitutively active α-secretase were located in a post-TGN compartment. Indeed, following TAPI treatment, sAPPα secretion was reduced by 85% in APPTGN-expressing cells, indicating that αreg accounted for the bulk of α-secretase activity in the TGN and that most of the non-TACE/ADAM-10-mediated α-secretase activity is confined to a post-TGN locus. Following PMA stimulation, sAPPα secretion was increased to similar extents in APPTGN- and APPWT-expressing cells. Because APPTGN is predominantly retained in the TGN, this suggests that αreg cleavage of APP occurs in the TGN. In contrast, in the absence of PMA treatment, α-secretase cleavage of APP occurs both in the TGN, where TACE/ADAM-10 is required for cleavage, and post-TGN, where cleavage of APP is TACE/ADAM-10-independent. In order to confirm that the TGN is the site in which αreg competes with β-secretase for cleavage of APP, we quantitated production of intracellular and secreted Aβ species in CHO cells expressing APPWT, APPTGN, and APPΔKK (Fig. 6). PMA attenuated Aβ1–40 secretion by a TAPI-sensitive mechanism in both APPWT- and APPTGN-expressing cells. This further confirms that αreg and β-secretase both can cleave APP in the TGN. Interestingly, PMA treatment also decreased levels of intracellular Aβ1–40 but not intracellular Aβ1–42. This may reflect the different sites of production for intracellular Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42, because Aβ1–40 is largely produced in the TGN, whereas intracellular Aβ1–42 is produced in the ER/IC (3.Cook D.G.

Indeed production of intracellular Aβ1–42 by ER retained APPΔKK was unaffected by PMA or TAPI. Because experiments with CHO695 cells suggested that αreg, like β-secretase, cleaves APP inside the cell, we asked whether the subcellular localization of TACE and ADAM-10 are consistent with intracellular sites of activity. Indeed, mature ADAM-10 is found both on the cell surface and intracellularly. Although mature TACE has also been labeled at the cell surface, we asked whether or not mature TACE is also found inside the cell. To this end, CHO cells"

Omi protein consists of 458 amino acids and has homology to bacterial HtrA endoprotease, which acts as a chaperone at low temperatures and as a proteolytic enzyme that removes denatured or damaged substrates at elevated temperatures. The carboxyl terminus of Omi has extensive homology to a mammalian protein called L56 (human HtrA), but unlike L56, which is secreted, Omi is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Omi has several novel putative protein-protein interaction motifs, as well as a PDZ domain and a Src homology 3-binding domain. Omi mRNA is expressed ubiquitously, and the gene is localized on human chromosome 2p12. Omi interacts with Mxi2, an alternatively spliced form of the p38 stress-activated kinase.

Some of these stress conditions can result in the accumulation of damaged and/or denatured proteins within cells. Spontaneous mutations can also cause misfolding of a particular polypeptide. To monitor and assist the proper folding of proteins, cells have numerous specialized proteins, including chaperones and proteases. Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 leads to the activation of the unfolded protein response (1.Sidrauski C. Chapman R. Walter P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 245-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), an intracellular pathway present in all eukaryotic cells that originates in the ER. When activated, the unfolded protein response controls the transcription of genes involved in protein folding (2.Chapman R. Sidrauski C. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 459-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This results in the proper folding or removal of damaged proteins in the ER, which is necessary for the recovery and ultimate survival of cells following environmental stress. In bacteria exposed to elevated temperature or oxidative stress, damaged and denatured proteins are removed by the action of the HtrA (high temperature requirement A) endoprotease (reviewed in Ref.3.Pallen M.J. Wren B.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). HtrA is localized in the periplasmic space of bacteria, and its presence is necessary for bacterial thermotolerance. HtrA is an active serine protease and has two PDZ domains known to be involved in protein-protein interactions (4.Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1385-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 5.Harrison S.C. Cell. 1996; 86: 341-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 6.Saras J. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It has recently been found that bacterial HtrA has a dual role acting as chaperone at normal temperatures and an active protease at elevated temperatures (7.Spiess C. Beil A. Ehrmann M. Cell. 1999; 97: 339-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Here we report the isolation and characterization of a mammalian homologue of HtrA, which we call Omi. Omi is a novel serine protease that has extensive homology to the bacterial HtrA heat shock protease. Omi also has homology with L56, a cDNA isolated in a differential screen for mRNAs repressed by SV40 transformation of human fibroblasts (8.Zumbrunn J. Trueb B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The L56 cDNA (human HtrA) was also independently isolated as a differentially expressed protein in human osteoathritic cartilage (9.Hu S.-I. Carozza M. Klein M. Nantermet P. Luk D. Crowl R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34406-34412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The homology among Omi, L56, and HtrA is restricted to the carboxyl terminus of the polypeptides; the amino terminus for each protein is unique. Furthermore, Omi is immunolocalized exclusively in the ER, whereas L56 is secreted. Omi has numerous protein-protein interaction motifs, including a SH3-binding domain, a novel motif that is repeated three times in Omi, a PDZ domain, and a putative transmembrane region. Via its PDZ domain, Omi can specifically bind the carboxyl terminus of Mxi2, an alternatively spliced form of p38 stress-activated kinase (10.Zervos A.S. Faccio L. Gatto J. Kyriakis J.M. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10531-10534Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Baculovirus-expressed Omi shows proteolytic activity in an assay that uses β-casein as a generic substrate. We used a mouse model system of kidney ischemia/reperfusion to investigate whether the proteolytic activity of Omi is regulated by stress. The same model system has been extensively used to study regulation of stress-activated kinases (11.De Silva H. Cioffi C. Yin T. Sandhu G. Webb R.L. Whelan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 12.Safirstein R. Adv. Renal Replace.

Renal Failure. 1994; 16: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this model, the proteolytic activity of Omi was substantially increased following kidney ischemia/reperfusion. This suggests activation of Omi may play a role in the biochemical changes that follow kidney ischemia and may serve as a cellular protective response. A HeLa cDNA library was screened using a modified yeast two-hybrid system (14.Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 15.Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). We used the full-length Mxi2 fused to LexA1–220 as a bait. EGY48 (MATαtrp1ura3his 3leu2::p3LexAop-Leu2) yeast strain was used, which has an integrated LEU reporter gene and upstream LexA operators as well as a pSH18–34 (LexAop-lacZ) 2 μ plasmid that directs the synthesis of β-galactosidase (14.Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Of the 1 million primary yeast colonies screened, 88 colonies were initially isolated by their ability to grow on Gal-Ura-His-Trp-Leu-selective plates. When these were tested on Ura-His-Trp-X-gal glucose and Ura-His-Trp-X-gal galactose plates, several colonies had a galactose-dependent phenotype. The cDNA library plasmids were isolated from these colonies and introduced into KC8Escherichia coli by electroporation. One of the Mxi2-specific interactors was further characterized by PCR analysis and partial restriction digest. The complete sequence of the cDNA was determined by sequencing both strands with a commercially available kit (United States Biochemicals). Sure-RACE PCR (Origene) was used to obtain the complete 5′ sequence of Omi cDNA. Sequence searches were performed using the BLAST program on the NCBI network server. The sequence data of the human Omi cDNA is accessible under GenBankTM accession number AF020760. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Sigma). All transient transfections were done on 100-mm dishes using the calcium phosphate method (16.Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). Briefly, the transfection mixture was prepared by resuspending 10 μg of DNA in 500 μl of 250 mm CaCl2 and incubating for 30 min at room temperature; the CaCl2 mixture was then added to 500 μl of Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, while bubbling air through it. The mixture was left at room temperature for 20 min and then added to the cells. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed using 400 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 25% glycerol, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40. Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm. Preclearing was done by adding 350 μl of TS buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl) and 100 μl of protein G-agarose to a 200-μl aliquot of the cell lysate and incubating with rocking for 4 h at 4 °C. The protein G-agarose was then removed, and the precleared lysates were incubated with 5 μl of Omi polyclonal antibody for 1 h on ice. After this time, 20 μl of protein G-agarose beads was added, and the lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with TS buffer and resuspended in 30 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electro-transferred onto PVDF membranes (NEN Life Science Products) using a Trans-Blot (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding was blocked by saturating the membrane in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS. The membrane was exposed to 1:1000 diluted monoclonal antibody against the HA tag (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 5% nonfat dry milk. The following constructs expressing LexA-Mxi2 or LexA-p38 fusion proteins in yeast were used: LexA-Mxi2 aa 1–297 (full-length), LexA-Δ2Mxi2 aa 1–295, LexA-Δ4Mxi2 aa 1–293, and LexA-Δ6Mxi2 aa 1–291. Furthermore, a LexA-Mxi2+PSD was made that had the 80-amino acid-long unique carboxyl-terminal domain (PSD) of p38, corresponding to amino acids 281–360, fused to its carboxyl terminus. LexA-p38 aa 1–360 (full-length p38) fusion and a LexA-p38+MSD that had the unique 17 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of Mxi2 (MSD) fused to its end. All these constructs were made using PCR and specific primers that introduced an early terminator codon. The LexA-p38+MSD was made using the primers shown below in a PCR. The 3′ end primer was used to introduce the specific carboxyl terminus Mxi2 sequence (MSD) encoding 17 amino acids onto p38. Primers were as follows: sense primer p38, 5′-CCG CAA TTG CCA TGT CTC AGG AGA GGC CC-3′; antisense primer p38+MSD, 5′-CGC GGA TCC TCA TAT CAT AAC CAA TTC AAT ATC CAT GAG GTG AGG ATA TAT GGT CAA CTT ACC GGA CTC CAT CTC TTC TTG-3′. To make the Mxi2+PSD construct, two PCRs were used. The resulting products were then used as templates in a final PCR. The first two primers used to amplify the 5′ portion of the chimeric protein were as follows: sense primer Mxi2, 5′-CCG CAA TTG CCA TGT CTC AGG AGA GGC CC-3′; antisense primer Mxi2+PSD, 5′-AAG GGC TTG GGC CGC TGT TAT CAT AAC CAA TTC AAT-3′. The 3′ end portion of the construct was made using the following primers: sense primer Mxi2+PSD, 5′-ATT GAA TTG GTT ATG ATA ACA GCG GCC CAA GCC CTT-3′; antisense primer p38, 5′-CGC GGA TCC TCA GGA CTC CAT CTC TTC TTG GTC-3′. The final PCR was performed using the sense primer Mxi2 5′ and the antisense primer p38. The final PCR product encoding Mxi+PSD was digested with MfeI/BamHI and cloned intoEcoRI/BamHI sites of pL202 vector. DNA sequence was verified by sequencing both DNA strands using a commercially available kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The following pair of primers was used to PCR amplify a DNA fragment encoding the PDZ domain of Omi corresponding to amino acids 381–458: OMI-PDZ 5′ end, 5′-GAT GTG CCA GAT TAT GCC TCT CCC GAA TTC GAA CCA AGC TTT CCC GAT GTT-3′; 3′ end, 5′-CTC TGG CGA AGA AGT CCA AAG CTT CTC GAG ATT CTG TGA CCT CAG GGG TCA-3′. The following primers were used to subject to PCR a DNA fragment encoding the PDZ domain of L56/Hum.HtrA, corresponding to amino acids 402–480: L56 PDZ 5′ end, 5′-GAT GTG CCA GAT TAT GCC TCT CCC GAA TTC CAC CGG GAC TTC CCA GAC GTG-3′; L56 PDZ 3′ end, 5′-CTC TGG CGA AGA AGT CCA AAG CTT CTC GAG CTA TGG GTC AAT TTC TTC GGG-3′. The PCR products were cloned into the yeast vector pJG4–5 vector (14.Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar) by homologous recombination as described in Ref. 17.Fusco C. Guidotti E. Zervos A.S. Yeast. 1999; 15: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar. Expression of the fusion proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis of yeast extracts using anti-HA antibody. Interaction of these fusion proteins with Mxi2 in yeast was detected using standard procedures (15.Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Human mRNA tissue and cancer blot (CLONTECH) were hybridized at 42 °C with a radiolabeled probe corresponding to full-length Omi cDNA, as described previously (18.Bao J. Zervos A.S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2171-2176PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were washed at 65 °C with 2% SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min followed by 0.1% SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min. The blots were then subjected to autoradiography. Anti-Omi antibodies were prepared by immunizing rabbits with the carboxyl-terminal region of Omi protein (residues 217–458) fused to the maltose-binding protein (New England Biolabs). The fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and purified using maltose-amylose resin (New England Biolabs). Affinity purified maltose-binding protein-Omi was resolved on polyacrylamide gels. Acrylamide gel pieces containing the maltose-binding protein-Omi fusion protein were excised and used to inject rabbits (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc). Anti-Omi antibodies were affinity purified on a column of maltose-binding protein-Omi covalently linked to Sepharose. Immunoblotting was performed using the anti-Omi antiserum at 1:1000 dilution. The secondary antibody used was a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad). Visualization of antibody binding was carried out using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cDNA coding for the full-length Omi was subcloned into the pAcGHTL (Pharmingen) vector, downstream of the coding sequence of glutathioneS-transferase (GST). In order to make the OmiS306A mutant, a four primer, two-reaction protocol was used. Briefly, two overlapping PCR fragments were generated incorporating the codon change for the new amino acid. The primers used for the first set of reactions were as follows: sense primer A, 5′-CCG CAA TTG ATG GCT GCG CCG AGG GCG-3′; antisense primer B, 5′-GGG ACC TCC GGC GTT TCC-3′. The primers used for the second set of reactions were as follows: sense primer C, 5′-TTT GGA AAC GCC GGA GGT C-3′; antisense primer D, 5′-GGG GTA CCT CAT TCT GTG ACC TCA GG-3′. The final PCR was performed using sense primer A and antisense primer D and the PCR products from the previous reactions as template. The final 1.370-kb DNA fragment encoding the mutant OmiS306A was digested withMfeI/KpnI and cloned into theEcoRI/KpnI sites of the pAcGHTL expression vector. The fidelity of both cDNA clones encoding for wild type and mutant Omi was confirmed by DNA sequencing of both strands (United States Biochemicals). SF9 insect cells were co-transfected with the recombinant transfer vector and linearized BaculoGold baculovirus DNA (Pharmingen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. A high titer solution of recombinant baculovirus was used to infect SF9 cells. After 3 days of incubation at 27 °C, the insect cells were removed from the culture plates and recovered by low speed centrifugation. The cell pellets were stored at −80 °C until further processing. Infected SF9 cells were resuspended into cell lysis buffer (Pharmingen) without protease inhibitors, using 1 ml of buffer for 2 × 107 cells. Cell lysis was performed on ice for 45 min and completed by Dounce homogenization. The cell lysate was clarified by low speed centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was then added to glutathione-conjugated Sepharose beads (Sigma), and the slurry was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C on a rotating platform. The beads were recovered by low speed centrifugation and washed twice with a large excess of cold washing buffer solution (8 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) followed by three washes with a large excess of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. The bound fusion protein was then eluted twice (20 min at room temperature) with 5 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, using a volume of reduced glutathione equal to the initial volume of packed beads. The presence of GST-Omi fusion protein was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using anti-Omi antiserum. The purified protein was used for proteolytic assays at a concentration of approximately 1 mg/ml. The proteolytic activity of Omi was measured using a commercially available assay system (Athena Environmental Sciences, Inc.). The assay employs a universal substrate of a dye-protein conjugate cross linked to a matrix. Protease activity is determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance of the dye released from the matrix to the supernatant. The anti-Omi polyclonal antibody was prebound to protein G-agarose beads. Tissue lysate (500 μg) prepared as from mouse kidneys as described below was added to 50 μl of 50% suspension of beads and gently shaken for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with 1× STN buffer. The beads were then added as a suspension of 500 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to the reaction vials containing the matrix-substrate and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. The activity of Omi was measured at different incubation times, and reactions were terminated by adding 500 μl of 0.2n NaOH to each vial. The absorbance of the supernatant in each reaction vial was measured at 450 nm. The proteolytic activity of baculovirus made GST-Omi fusion was monitored using 10 μl (approximately 10 μg) of purified protein incubated with 5 μg of β-casein (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for 30 min, 1 h or 2 h at 37 °C. The proteolytic activity of GST-OmiS306A was monitored using 20 μg of purified protein incubated with 5 μg of β-casein (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for 3 h. The reaction products were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and proteins visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. COS-7 cells were plated at 80% confluency on fibronectin (100 ng/μl)-coated coverslips. Cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde containing 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. Incubation with primary and secondary antibodies was performed at room temperature for 1 h, followed by three 15-min washes in PBS. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal against Omi at a concentration of 0.8 μg/ml and mouse monoclonal antibody against BiP (StressGen) used as an ER-specific marker at a dilution of 1:500. The secondary antibodies were fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (SantaCruz), used at a concentration of 15 μg/ml, and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Cappel), used at a dilution of 1:100. The left kidney of Balb/c mice was removed through a flank incision as described previously (19.Ouellette A.J. Malt R.A. Sukhatme V.P. Bonventre J.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Twenty-four h later, ischemia of the right kidney was induced for 30 min followed by reperfusion (19.Ouellette A.J. Malt R.A. Sukhatme V.P. Bonventre J.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Kidneys were harvested 1 or 24 h after reperfusion. The mouse kidneys were homogenized in 5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× Trasylol, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate) and sonicated on ice. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm at 4 °C, and the collected supernatants were further centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The kidney supernatant was kept in a final concentration of 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm Na3VO4. 150 μg of total protein extracts was separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the amount of Omi protein was detected by Western blot analysis using the Omi polyclonal antibody (1:1000). In order to isolate Mxi2-interacting proteins, we used a modified yeast two-hybrid system to screen a HeLa cDNA library (14.Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 15.Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Of the 106 primary yeast transformants screened, 88 colonies appeared to contain a potential interactor. Of these, only two had an unambiguous phenotype. The two plasmids were rescued and shown to represent the same cDNA, although one had a longer 3′ untranslated sequence (results not shown). The partial cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 312 amino acids fused in-frame to the B42 activation domain of the pJG-4.5 vector. Sure-RACE PCR (Origene) was used to obtain the complete 5′ Omi DNA sequence. The full-length Omi cDNA encodes for a protein of 458 amino acids with an estimatedM r of 50,000. Based on homology with other known polypeptides, we arbitrarily assigned two domains to the protein: an amino-terminal regulatory domain and a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain (Fig.1 B). The regulatory domain had a putative transmembrane region localized between amino acids 105–125 and a potential phosphorylation site (SPRS) for stress-activated kinases at position 142. Overlapping the phosphorylation site there was a SH3-binding domain (PPPASPR) (20.Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 21.Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Upstream of this site there was a sequence motif PRAXXTXXTP (whereX can be any amino acid) that was present three times in the regulatory domain (Fig. 1 B). This was the first report on the identification of this motif. No function associated with this structure has been reported thus far. The catalytic domain of Omi showed extensive homology to E. coli heat shock protease HtrA as well as with a mammalian protein called L56/hHtrA (8.Zumbrunn J. Trueb B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 9.Hu S.-I. Carozza M. Klein M. Nantermet P. Luk D. Crowl R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34406-34412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The catalytic domain of Omi had 51% identity and 68% similarity with the corresponding domain of L56/hHtrA and 36% identity and 58% similarity with bacterial HtrA. Like L56/hHtrA, Omi also has a single PDZ domain whereas the bacterial HtrA has two PDZ domains. These PDZ domains are involved in binding directly to the carboxyl termini of target proteins (6.Saras J. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To study the interaction of Mxi2 or p38 and Omi in vivo, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using HEK293 cells transiently transfected with plasmids expressing Mxi2-HA or p38-HA. We used a polyclonal antibody raised against Omi to precipitate the endogenous protein. After resolving the precipitated complex on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, the presence of HA-Mxi2 or HA-p38 in the complex was detected using anti-HA antibody. These experiments showed that Omi can bind Mxi2 in vivo, and that the affinity of the interaction is strong enough to allow the proteins to co-immunoprecipitate. Omi was able to interact with Mxi2 when the transfected cells were treated with anisomycin (an activator of p38 stress-activated kinases) or SB205380 (a known inhibitor of p38 kinase). In the same experiment, no interaction was detected between HA-p38 and Omi (Fig. 3 A). To define the amino acid sequence of Mxi2 responsible for binding to Omi, LexA-fusions corresponding to the full-length Mxi2 (aa 1–297) and three deletion mutants of Mxi2 (Δ2Mxi2 aa 1–295, Δ4Mxi2 aa 1–293, and Δ6Mxi2 aa 1–291) were made. Also, full-length LexA-p38 (aa 1–360) and two chimeric fusion proteins, one containing the p38-specific carboxyl-terminal domain (PSD) fused to LexA-Mxi2 (LexA Mxi2+PSD) and another containing the Mxi2-specific carboxyl-terminal domain (MSD) fused to p38 (LexA p38+MSD), were used (Fig. 3 B). In these experiments, Mxi2 but not p38 was able to bind to Omi and the carboxyl-terminal sequence of Mxi2 was required for interaction. Deletion of the last amino acid of Mxi2 abolished most of the binding with Omi (Fig. 3 B). When the carboxyl terminus of Mxi2 was blocked by fusing the p38-specific, 80-amino acid sequence, the interaction with Omi was abolished. This indicated that the recognition sequence has to be at the end of the carboxyl terminus of the protein. To further explore the properties of the unique sequence of the carboxyl terminus of Mxi2, the 17-amino acid long Mxi2-specific carboxyl terminus was fused to the end of p38. This p38+MSD fusion protein was now able to bind Omi in yeast. Fig. 3 C shows that the interaction between Mxi2 and the PDZ domain of Omi is highly specific. Mxi2 was not able to interact with the PDZ domain of L56, a homologue of Omi that has a PDZ domain with high similarity to the PDZ domain of Omi (see Fig. 2). To investigate the expression of Omi, we performed Northern blot analysis using mRNA from different human tissues as well as from a number of tumor cell lines. As shown in Fig. 4, Omi is represented by two distinct mRNA species that are expressed ubiquitously, a major one of approximately 2.1 kb and a minor one of 4.5 kb. The highest level of Omi expression is found in placenta and pancreas (Fig. 4 A). In tumor cell lines, high expression of Omi was found in promyelocytic leukemia HL-60, chronic myelogenus leukemia K-562, Burkitt lymphoma Raji, and human colorectal carcinoma SW480 cell lines (Fig. 4 B). The Omi gene is localized on human chromosome 2, region p12 (Fig.5). Translocations and deletions of this region are found in acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemias, as well as nonlymphocytic leukemia and Hodgkin disease (22.Shapiro D.N. Valentine V. Eagle L. Yin X. Morris S.W. Prochownik E.V. Genomics. 1994; 23: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Figure 5Chromosomal localization of Omi.

The fluorescence distribution, a fine reticular network all over the cytoplasm and around the nuclear envelope, was suggestive of an ER staining pattern. To confirm that the endogenous Omi protein is localized in the ER, we compared the fluorescence staining pattern of cells stained with Omi antibodies and BiP staining. BiP is a well characterized marker localized in the ER-lumen. The two staining patterns were almost identical, indicating that Omi is localized predominantly in the ER. The Omi cDNA representing the entire coding sequence was cloned into pAcGHTL baculovirus vector (Pharmingen) that expresses the Omi protein as a fusion to the GST. Expression of the fusion protein was detected by immunoblot analysis using anti-Omi antiserum and the protein was purified on a GST column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fig.7 A shows the proteolytic activity of the purified GST-Omi protein. The GST-Omi protein was concentrated and incubated for varying lengths of time with β-casein at 37 °C. Proteolytic activity was detected as early as 30 min (Fig.7 A, lane c), and the substrate used in the assay was completely degraded after 2 h (lane e). The baculovirus GST-Omi (S306A) mutant, which changes serine 306 to an alanine (S306A), showed no detectable protease activity after 3 h incubation (Fig.7 B). Using Omi-specific antibodies, the protein was precipitated from kidney extracts of mice that underwent ischemia and"

These observations suggest that epithelial tissues possess the capacity to express lumican under certain conditions.Several studies have demonstrated that SLRP proteins can modulate cellular behaviors, i.e. cell migration and proliferation during embryonic development, tissue repair, and tumor growth, in addition to their extracellular matrix functions as regulators of tissue hydration and collagen fibrillogenesis (20.Fullwood N.J.

For example, decorin is one of the SLRP proteins with well characterized functions for modulating cellular behaviors. Decorin protein alters the cell cycle process in neoplastic cells both by modulating the activities of growth factors and by direct interaction with a cell-surface receptor (23.Iozzo R.V.

Cultured vascular endothelial cells start to express decorin after the formation of tube-like structures and also up-regulate biglycan expression during repair after a damage (25.Jarvelainen H.T.

Under some pathological conditions, the corneal epithelium shows an increase in decorin immunoreactivity compared with normal corneal epithelium (27.Funderburgh J.L. Hevelone N.D. Roth M.R.

Macrophages, on the other hand, express the cell-surface receptor for lumican. These cells bind the low-sulfated glycoprotein form of lumican, but not lumican modified with keratan sulfate chains, suggesting that non- or low-sulfated lumican might provide a scaffold for macrophages invading injured corneal stroma (28.Funderburgh J.L. Mitschler R.R. Funderburgh M.L. Roth M.R. Chapes S.K. Conrad G.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1997; 38: 1159-1167PubMed Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to hypothesize that lumican, like decorin, may have biological functions for modulating corneal cell behavior such as adhesion, migration, or proliferation during tissue morphogenesis or wound healing.In this study, employing in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry, we first showed that migrating corneal epithelial cells ectopically and transiently express lumican during wound healing. To examine the hypothesis that lumican actively modulates epithelial wound healing, we then examined the effects of an anti-lumican antibody on closure of a corneal epithelial defect and the healing of corneal epithelial defects in lumican-null mice. Our results suggest that lumican may play a role in epithelial cell migration or adhesion, thus contributing to corneal epithelial wound healing.DISCUSSIONThe evidence available suggests that SLRP proteins are key regulatory molecules of collagen fibrillogenesis (36.Iozzo R. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Null mutants of SLRP family proteins, i.e. decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, and lumican, are manifested by malfunctions of connective tissues associated with abnormal extracellular matrix, i.e. fragile skin, cloudy cornea, and thick collagen fibrils (15.Chakravarti S.

Our lumican-null mice have phenotypes that closely resemble those described by Chakravarti et al. (15.Chakravarti S. Magnuson T. Lass J.H. Jepsen K.J. LaMantia C. Carroll H. J.

It is of interest that the results of the present study imply that lumican, in addition to serving as a regulator of collagen fibrillogenesis, may modulate epithelial cell migration during corneal wound healing. We observed an ectopic and transient expression of lumican mRNA in healing mouse corneal epithelium as early as 8 h after an epithelial débridement (Fig. 4). An obvious accumulation of lumican protein occurred in the basal epithelial cells and the basement membrane of injured epithelia after 2–3 days of healing (Fig. 5). The observation is consistent with the notion that lumican is secreted by the epithelial cells. The up-regulated lumican synthesis can account for the intracellular immunoreactivity observed in the healing epithelium. The addition of anti-lumican antibodies to the culture medium retarded closure of an epithelial defect in healing wounds in vitro (Table I), andLum −/− mice lacking lumican showed delayed re-epithelialization of corneal epithelial defects in vivo(Fig. 6 and Table II). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that lumican expressed in injured corneal epithelium modulates corneal epithelial wound healing. Interestingly, keratocan, another member of SLRP family closely related to lumican, was not expressed by injured corneal epithelium, but only by stromal keratocytes. This finding indicates that these two KSPG proteins are transcriptionally regulated differently, albeit both are major KSPG constituents of the corneal stroma extracellular matrix.Several other studies have presented results consistent with epithelial expression of lumican. In chick, KSPG precursor protein synthesis by organ culture of corneal epithelia amounts to 7.2% of the protein synthesis of organ-cultured whole corneas (40.Schrecengost P.K. Blochberger T.C. Hassell J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, the basal and suprabasal cells of the hyperproliferative corneal epithelium of a Corn1 mouse (41.Smith R.S. Hawes N.L. Kuhlmann S.D. Heckenlively J.R. Chang B. Roderick T.H. Sundberg J.P.

Rat corneal epithelium was previously shown to transiently up-regulate glycoprotein synthesis as a result of wounding (43.Gipson I.K. Kiorpes T.C. Dev.

This glycoprotein may represent the lumican induction described in the present study. Our data do not directly elucidate the mechanism by which lumican may modulate epithelial cell adhesion or migration. Recently, a novel bone KSPG core protein of the SLRP family, osteoadherin, was found to be distributed in bovine fetal rib growth plate and in newly deposited bone in vivo (45.Wendel M. Sommarin Y. Heinegard D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that osteoadherin can mediate cell attachment via binding by αvβ3integrin in vitro (45.Wendel M. Sommarin Y. Heinegard D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A divalent cation-dependent lumican cell-surface receptor has been identified in macrophages, implying possible binding of integrin to lumican. Binding of cells to lumican, however, is strongly inhibited by the presence of keratan sulfate chains on lumican (28.Funderburgh J.L. Mitschler R.R. Funderburgh M.L. Roth M.R. Chapes S.K. Conrad G.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1997; 38: 1159-1167PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that lumican transiently expressed by injured epithelium might interact with integrin receptors of epithelial cells; thus, it may facilitate healing of epithelial defects. However, the presence of such cell-surface receptor(s) of lumican in corneal epithelial cells is to be proven in future studies. Our unpublished observations 3S. Saika, C.-Y. Lin, and W. W.-Y. Kao, unpublished observations. by transmission electron microscopy revealed that there is no apparent difference in the ultrastructure of the basement membrane and hemidesmosomes of unwounded corneas and of those of 1 or 2 months after an epithelial débridement in Lum +/− andLum −/− mice. These observations are consistent with the notion that impaired epithelial wound healing was not caused by structural abnormalities of the denuded corneal surface due to the absence of lumican in Lum −/− mice.Our finding that lumican may have a role in modulating corneal wound healing of epithelial defects is consistent with an emerging body of data showing that SLRP proteins not only serve as regulators of collagenous extracellular matrix assembly, but also have biological roles involving direct interactions with cells. These include mediation of cell migration and proliferation (20.Fullwood N.J. Davies Y. Nieduszynski I.A. Marcyniuk B. Ridgway A.E. Quantock A.J. Invest. Ophthalmol.

Laser surgery to correct refractive errors is a widely practiced procedure, after which rapid re-epithelialization is required to avoid complications such as infection or induction of scar tissue. The findings reported here suggest the possible therapeutic use of lumican protein in topical administration after such surgery or in the treatment of corneal or skin wounds. Rapid re-epithelialization is essential for restoration of homeostasis in injured tissues; impaired healing of injured epithelium increases the risks of infection and further damage underlying tissues (1.Brown D.L.

The cornea provides an ideal model to evaluate interactions of migrating epithelial cells and the extracellular matrix of the underlying basement membrane during wound healing because epithelial injuries of the avascular corneal tissue heal in a bloodless wound field.

Lumican belongs to the family of small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs)1 that includes keratocan, mimecan, decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, epiphycan, and osteoadherin. In the cornea, lumican, keratocan, and mimecan are modified with keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains comprising the keratan sulfate proteoglycans (KSPG) of the stromal extracellular matrix (8.Corpuz L.M.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30306-30313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Lumican KSPG is a key regulator of collagen fibrillogenesis, a process critical to corneal transparency. Mice lacking lumican show an age-dependent corneal opacity and a high proportion of abnormally thick collagen fibers in the corneal stroma (15.Chakravarti S. Magnuson T. Lass J.H. Jepsen K.J. LaMantia C. Carroll H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Lumican is also widely present as a non- or low-sulfated glycoprotein in connective tissues of many other organ systems, e.g.skeleton, heart, kidney, and lung (14.Ying S. Shiraishi A. Kao C.W.-C.

During mouse embryonic ocular development, lumican is synthesized by keratocytes; detected as a glycoprotein, not as a KSPG (19.Cornuet P.K. Blochberger T.C. Hassell J.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1994; 35: 870-877PubMed Google Scholar); and also transiently expressed by the corneal epithelium, neural retina, and epidermis (14.Ying S. Shiraishi A. Kao C.W.-C. Converse R.L.

These observations suggest that epithelial tissues possess the capacity to express lumican under certain conditions. Several studies have demonstrated that SLRP proteins can modulate cellular behaviors, i.e. cell migration and proliferation during embryonic development, tissue repair, and tumor growth, in addition to their extracellular matrix functions as regulators of tissue hydration and collagen fibrillogenesis (20.Fullwood N.J. Davies Y. Nieduszynski I.A. Marcyniuk B. Ridgway A.E. Quantock A.J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1996; 37: 1256-1270PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

For example, decorin is one of the SLRP proteins with well characterized functions for modulating cellular behaviors. Decorin protein alters the cell cycle process in neoplastic cells both by modulating the activities of growth factors and by direct interaction with a cell-surface receptor (23.Iozzo R.V. Moscatello D.K. McQuillan D.J. Eichstetter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4489-4492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 24.Moscatello D.K. Santra M. Mann D.M. McQuillan D.J. Wong A.J. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Cultured vascular endothelial cells start to express decorin after the formation of tube-like structures and also up-regulate biglycan expression during repair after a damage (25.Jarvelainen H.T. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Kinsella M.G. Sandell L.J. Sage E.H. Wight T.N. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 203: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26.Jarvelainen H.T. Kinsella M.G. Wight T.N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23274-23281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under some pathological conditions, the corneal epithelium shows an increase in decorin immunoreactivity compared with normal corneal epithelium (27.Funderburgh J.L. Hevelone N.D. Roth M.R. Funderburgh M.L. Rodrigues M.R. Nirankari V.S. Conrad G.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1998; 39: 1957-1964PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages, on the other hand, express the cell-surface receptor for lumican. These cells bind the low-sulfated glycoprotein form of lumican, but not lumican modified with keratan sulfate chains, suggesting that non- or low-sulfated lumican might provide a scaffold for macrophages invading injured corneal stroma (28.Funderburgh J.L. Mitschler R.R. Funderburgh M.L. Roth M.R. Chapes S.K. Conrad G.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1997; 38: 1159-1167PubMed Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to hypothesize that lumican, like decorin, may have biological functions for modulating corneal cell behavior such as adhesion, migration, or proliferation during tissue morphogenesis or wound healing. In this study, employing in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry, we first showed that migrating corneal epithelial cells ectopically and transiently express lumican during wound healing. To examine the hypothesis that lumican actively modulates epithelial wound healing, we then examined the effects of an anti-lumican antibody on closure of a corneal epithelial defect and the healing of corneal epithelial defects in lumican-null mice. Our results suggest that lumican may play a role in epithelial cell migration or adhesion, thus contributing to corneal epithelial wound healing. DISCUSSIONThe evidence available suggests that SLRP proteins are key regulatory molecules of collagen fibrillogenesis (36.Iozzo R. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Null mutants of SLRP family proteins, i.e. decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, and lumican, are manifested by malfunctions of connective tissues associated with abnormal extracellular matrix, i.e. fragile skin, cloudy cornea, and thick collagen fibrils (15.Chakravarti S.

Our lumican-null mice have phenotypes that closely resemble those described by Chakravarti et al. (15.Chakravarti S. Magnuson T. Lass J.H. Jepsen K.J. LaMantia C. Carroll H. J.

The up-regulated lumican synthesis can account for the intracellular immunoreactivity observed in the healing epithelium. The addition of anti-lumican antibodies to the culture medium retarded closure of an epithelial defect in healing wounds in vitro (Table I), andLum −/− mice lacking lumican showed delayed re-epithelialization of corneal epithelial defects in vivo(Fig. 6 and Table II). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that lumican expressed in injured corneal epithelium modulates corneal epithelial wound healing. Interestingly, keratocan, another member of SLRP family closely related to lumican, was not expressed by injured corneal epithelium, but only by stromal keratocytes. This finding indicates that these two KSPG proteins are transcriptionally regulated differently, albeit both are major KSPG constituents of the corneal stroma extracellular matrix. Several other studies have presented results consistent with epithelial expression of lumican. In chick, KSPG precursor protein synthesis by organ culture of corneal epithelia amounts to 7.2% of the protein synthesis of organ-cultured whole corneas (40.Schrecengost P.K. Blochberger T.C. Hassell J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, the basal and suprabasal cells of the hyperproliferative corneal epithelium of a Corn1 mouse (41.Smith R.S. Hawes N.L. Kuhlmann S.D. Heckenlively J.R. Chang B. Roderick T.H. Sundberg J.P. Invest. Ophthalmol.

Wong, S. Saika, C.-Y. Liu, C. W.-C. Kao, R. S. Smith, P. M. Nishina, J. P. Sundberg, and W. W.-Y. Kao, unpublished observations. In the adult cornea, lumican exists as KSPG; however, in non-corneal tissues as well as in embryonic and wounded corneas, lumican is found as a low- or non-sulfated glycoprotein (14.Ying S. Shiraishi A. Kao C.W.-C. Converse R.L. Funderburgh J.L. Swiergiel J. Roth M.R. Conrad G.W. Kao W.W.-Y. J. Biol.

Rat corneal epithelium was previously shown to transiently up-regulate glycoprotein synthesis as a result of wounding (43.Gipson I.K. Kiorpes T.C. Dev. Biol. 1982; 92: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 44.Gipson I.K. Kiorpes T.C. Brennan S.J. Dev. Biol. 1984; 101: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This glycoprotein may represent the lumican induction described in the present study. Our data do not directly elucidate the mechanism by which lumican may modulate epithelial cell adhesion or migration. Recently, a novel bone KSPG core protein of the SLRP family, osteoadherin, was found to be distributed in bovine fetal rib growth plate and in newly deposited bone in vivo (45.Wendel M. Sommarin Y. Heinegard D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that osteoadherin can mediate cell attachment via binding by αvβ3integrin in vitro (45.Wendel M. Sommarin Y. Heinegard D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A divalent cation-dependent lumican cell-surface receptor has been identified in macrophages, implying possible binding of integrin to lumican. Binding of cells to lumican, however, is strongly inhibited by the presence of keratan sulfate chains on lumican (28.Funderburgh J.L. Mitschler R.R. Funderburgh M.L. Roth M.R. Chapes S.K. Conrad G.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1997; 38: 1159-1167PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that lumican transiently expressed by injured epithelium might interact with integrin receptors of epithelial cells; thus, it may facilitate healing of epithelial defects. However, the presence of such cell-surface receptor(s) of lumican in corneal epithelial cells is to be proven in future studies. Our unpublished observations 3S. Saika, C.-Y. Lin, and W. W.-Y. Kao, unpublished observations. by transmission electron microscopy revealed that there is no apparent difference in the ultrastructure of the basement membrane and hemidesmosomes of unwounded corneas and of those of 1 or 2 months after an epithelial débridement in Lum +/− andLum −/− mice. These observations are consistent with the notion that impaired epithelial wound healing was not caused by structural abnormalities of the denuded corneal surface due to the absence of lumican in Lum −/− mice. Our finding that lumican may have a role in modulating corneal wound healing of epithelial defects is consistent with an emerging body of data showing that SLRP proteins not only serve as regulators of collagenous extracellular matrix assembly, but also have biological roles involving direct interactions with cells. These include mediation of cell migration and proliferation (20.Fullwood N.J. Davies Y. Nieduszynski I.A. Marcyniuk B. Ridgway A.E. Quantock A.J. Invest. Ophthalmol.

Laser surgery to correct refractive errors is a widely practiced procedure, after which rapid re-epithelialization is required to avoid complications such as infection or induction of scar tissue. The findings reported here suggest the possible therapeutic use of lumican protein in topical administration after such surgery or in the treatment of corneal or skin wounds."

In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of three mouse isoforms of HS6ST, a mouse homologue to the original human HS6ST (HS6ST-1) and two novel HS6STs (HS6ST-2 and HS6ST-3). The cDNAs have been obtained from mouse brain cDNA library by cross-hybridization with human HS6ST cDNA. The three cDNAs contained single open reading frames that predicted type II transmembrane proteins composed of 401, 506, and 470 amino acid residues, respectively. Amino acid sequence of HS6ST-1 was 51 and 57% identical to those of HS6ST-2 and HS6ST-3, respectively. HS6ST-2 and HS6ST-3 had the 50% identity. Overexpression of each isoform in COS-7 cells resulted in about 10-fold increase of HS6ST activity. The three isoforms purified with anti-FLAG antibody affinity column transferred sulfate to heparan sulfate and heparin but not to other glycosaminoglycans. Each isoform showed different specificity toward the isomeric hexuronic acid adjacent to the targetedN-sulfoglucosamine; HS6ST-1 appeared to prefer the iduronosyl N-sulfoglucosamine while HS6ST-2 had a different preference, depending upon the substrate concentrations, and HS6ST-3 acted on either substrate. Northern analysis showed that the expression of each message in various tissues was characteristic to the respective isoform. HS6ST-1 was expressed strongly in liver, and HS6ST-2 was expressed mainly in brain and spleen. In contrast, HS6ST-3 was expressed rather ubiquitously. These results suggest that the expression of these isoforms may be regulated in tissue-specific manners and that each isoform may be involved in the synthesis of heparan sulfates with tissue-specific structures and functions.

Recently, genetic screens and analyses are suggesting not only inDrosophila but also in mammals that these interactions also play pivotal roles in embryonic development. For example, thesugarless mutant (10.Binari R.C. Staveley B.E. Johnson W.A. Godavarti R. Sasisekharan R. Manoukian A.S. Development. 1997; 124: 2623-2632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Haerry T.E.

Nakato H. Sugiura M. Jannuzi A. Oakes R. Kaluza V. Golden C. Selleck S.B. Development. 1997; 124: 4113-4120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that pipe mutation affected the formation of embryonic dorsal-ventral polarity and the pipe gene encodes an enzyme similar to heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase inDrosophila (15.Sen J. Goltz J.S. Stevens L. Stein D. Cell. 1998; 95: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Also, targeted destruction of a mouse gene encoding heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase (HS2ST) caused severe developmental malfunction and resulted in lethal mutation (16.Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S. Wilson V.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1894-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In addition, three different genes (EXT-1, -2, and -3) were identified for hereditary multiple exostoses, characterized by multiple cartilaginous tumors, at least two of which (EXT-1 and -2) were found to encode proteins with heparan sulfate glycosyltransferase activity (26.Stickens D.

It is noteworthy that sulfations at various residues of the monosaccharides, especially O-sulfation, are essential to generate those specific regional structures. The ability of cells to produce heparan sulfate with the specific sulfated monosaccharide sequences described above depends on the specific mechanisms of heparan sulfate biosynthesis (20.Rosenberg R.D.

These isoforms play important roles in generating the specific and diverse structures of heparan sulfate. Three isoforms ofN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferases are present; these isoforms are distinguished from each other with respect to the extent of N-sulfation and the expression pattern in various tissues (57.Ishihara M.

Heparan sulfate glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase was also found to exist as four isoforms with different spectra of the acceptor substrate specificity (60.Shworak N.W. Liu J. Petros L.M. Zhang L.

Although the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate proceeds as a template free mechanism, the regulated expression of these isoforms and thus attained appropriate balance of the activities of these enzymes with different substrate specificities may allow the production of heparan sulfate with the highly specific structures. We previously purified to homogeneity heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (HS6ST) (47.Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4172-4179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and HS2ST (48.Kobayashi M. Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Saito M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7645-7653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) from the medium and cell layer of Chinese hamster ovary cell culture, respectively. Subsequently, we have performed the molecular cloning of HS6ST (56.Habuchi H. Kobayashi M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9208-9213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and HS2ST (53.Kobayashi M. Habuchi H. Yoneda M. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol.

It was curious that the recombinant human HS6ST preferred as acceptor the IdoUA-GlcNSO3 unit to the GlcUA-GlcNSO3 unit, while the ratios of the GlcUA-GlcNSO3 unit to the IdoUA-GlcNSO3 unit varied among heparan sulfate preparations obtained from different tissues and different developmental stages (62.Maccarana M.

We therefore hypothesize that an efficient sulfation of the GlcUA-GlcNSO3 unit might be catalyzed by other HS6STs with substrate specificities different from that of human HS6ST. In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of three HS6ST isoforms with different substrate specificities. We also describe the expression patterns in various tissues of the three isoforms. The following commercial materials were used: [35S]H2SO4 was purchased from NEN Life Science Products; Hybond N+ was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Tokyo); mouse brain cDNA library and mouse multiple tissue Northern blots were from CLONTECH(Palo Alto, CA); unlabeled PAPS was from Sigma; Hiload Superdex 30 HR 16/60 and fast desalting column HR 10/10 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; Partisil 10 SAX column was from Whatman (Clifton, NJ), PAMN column was from YMC (Kyoto, Japan). Heparitinase I (EC 4.2.2.8), II, and III (EC 4.2.2.7), chondroitin sulfate A, keratan sulfate from bovine cornea, completely desulfated N-resulfated heparin (CDSNS-heparin), completely desulfated N-acetylated heparin (CDSNAc-heparin), heparan sulfate from pig aorta, heparan sulfate from bovine liver, and unsaturated glycosaminoglycan disaccharide kit were obtained from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa was purchased from Sigma. Heparan sulfate from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor was a gift from Dr. T. Harada (Seikagku Corp.). Deacetylated N-sulfated heparosan (NS-heparosan) was prepared by chemically deacetylation and N-sulfation fromN-acetyl heparosan, which was prepared fromEscherichia coli K5 by Dr. Terumi Saito (Kanagawa University). [35S]PAPS was prepared as described previously (66.Delfert D.M. Conrad H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 148: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Chondroitin (squid skin) was prepared as described previously (67.Habuchi O. Miyata K. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 616: 208-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 × 106 plaques from the mouse brain cDNA library were screened using the human HS6ST cDNA as a probe. Hybond N+ nylon membrane replicas of the plaques from the λgt11 cDNA library were fixed by the alkali fixation method recommended by the manufacturer and prehybridized in a solution containing 37.5% (w/v) formamide, 5× SSPE (sodium chloride/sodium phosphate/EDTA buffer), 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and 0.05 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA for 3 h at 42 °C. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C in the same buffer containing32P-labeled probe for 16 h. Nineteen positive clones were detected by autoradiography, and the inserted cDNA was cleaved with EcoRI digestion and subcloned into pBluescript. The subcloned cDNAs were sequenced on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method usingTaq polymerase (dye terminator cycle sequencing; Perkin-Elmer) with DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems PRISM 310). The DNA sequences thus obtained were compiled and analyzed using GENETYX-MAX computer programs (Software Development Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were compared with other sequences in the nucleic acid and protein data bases of GenBankTM, DDBJ, dSTS, and dbEST. For the construction of the expression vectors, pFLAG-CMV2-mHS6ST-1, -2, and -3, the polymerase chain reaction products containing the open reading frame of 1203 base pairs from positions 280–1482 for mouse HS6ST-1 (mHS6ST-1), 1518 base pairs from positions 2–1519 for mHS6ST-2, and 1410 base pairs from positions 114–1523 for mHS6ST-3 were ligated into the EcoRI/ClaI site, theEcoRI/ClaI sites, and theClaI/KpnI sites of the pFLAG-CMV2 expression vector (Eastman Kodak Co.), respectively. The inserted sequences were confirmed on a single strand as described above. COS-7 cells (5.5 × 105) precultured for 48 h in a 60-mm culture dish were transfected with 5 μg of pFLAG-CMV2-mHS6ST-1, -2, and -3, respectively, or pFLAG-CMV2 alone. The transfection was performed using lipofectamine method according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol (TransFact, Promega). After incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and antibiotics for 72 h, the cell layers were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium alone, scraped, and homogenized in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, 10 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2. The homogenates were subjected to stirring for 1 h and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. FLAG fusion proteins in the supernatant (cell extract) were isolated by anti-FLAG M2 (Kodak) affinity chromatography according to the method described by the manufacturer, and the activities of HS6STs in the supernatants and FLAG-bound fractions were measured as described below. Mouse multiple tissue Northern blot filters (on which 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNAs from various adult mouse tissues were blotted) were prehybridized in ExpressHyb Hybridization SolutionTM (CLONTECH) at 68 °C for 30 min and then were hybridized in the same solution containing 32P-labeled probes (1 × 106cpm/ml) at 68 °C for 1 h. The probes used were a 1203-base fragment at positions 280–1482 of mHS6ST-1 cDNA, a 1501-base fragment at positions 1–1501 of mHS6ST-2 cDNA, and a 1173-base fragment at positions 1–1173 of mHS6ST-3 cDNA, respectively, and mouse β-actin cDNA, which were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random oligonucleotide priming (Ready-to-Go DNA labeling kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were washed several times with 2× SSC and 0.05% SDS at room temperature and subsequently with 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50 °C two times. The membranes were exposed to x-ray film with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. Sulfotransferase activities were determined as described previously. Briefly, the standard reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 2.5 μmol of imidazole-HCl, pH 6.8, 3.75 μg of protamine chloride, 25 nmol (as hexosamine) (500 μm) of acceptor glycosaminoglycans, 50 pmol of [35S]PAPS (about 5 × 105 cpm, 1 μm), and enzyme. After incubation for 20 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by heating at 100 °C at 1 min. Carrier chondroitin sulfate A (0.1 μmol as glucuronic acid) was added to the reaction mixture, and the35S-labeled polysaccharides were isolated by precipitation with ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate and 0.5 mmEDTA, followed by gel chromatography on a Fast desalting column to remove [35S]PAPS and its degradation products. The amounts of enzymes added to the reaction mixture were chosen in order to obtain the linear incorporation of [35S]sulfate. We measured 35S incorporation activities into various glycosaminoglycans by each purified recombinant enzyme under those conditions. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount required to transfer 1 pmol of sulfate/min to CDSNS-heparin. Effects of various concentrations of acceptor glycosaminoglycans or donor substrate PAPS on sulfotransferase activities were also determined under the above standard reaction conditions. The apparentK m values for acceptor or donor substrates were calculated by double-reciprocal plotting of the incorporation activities and the substrate concentrations (Lineweaver-Burk plot). Analysis of the reaction products by expressed enzymes was performed by HPLC as described previously (31.Habuchi H. Suzuki S. Saito T. Tamura T. Harada T. Yoshida K. Kimata K. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly,35S-labeled products were digested with a mixture of 10 milliunits of heparitinase I, 1 milliunit of heparitinase II, and 10 milliunits of heparitinase III in 40 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm CaCl2, 4 μg of bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 2 h. The digests were subjected to gel chromatography of Superdex 30 pg equilibrated with 0.2m NH4HCO3. The35S-labeled disaccharide fractions were injected into a PAMN column together with standard unsaturated disaccharides of the kit. Fractions of 0.6 ml were collected, and their radioactivities were measured. The 35S-labeled products were degraded with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 (68.Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), and then anomalous deamination products were cleaved by the additional treatment of mild acid hydrolysis (25 mm H2SO4 at 80 °C for 30 min) (69.Kusche M. Oscarsson L.G. Reynertson R. Roden L. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7400-7409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final products were applied onto a column of Superdex 30 pg, and the disacccharides fractions were collected and analyzed by HPLC on a Partisil-10 SAX column together with unsaturated disaccharides as internal markers. A mouse brain cDNA library was screened using human HS6ST cDNA as a probe. Nineteen positive clones were obtained from 2 × 106 plaques. Seventeen independent clones were isolated and subcloned into pBluescripts II KS. The nucleotide sequences of inserted cDNAs were classified into three groups, and their open reading frames encoded three different proteins, which we named HS6ST-1, HS6ST-2, and HS6ST-3. The amino acid sequences of HS6ST-1, HS6ST-2, and HS6ST-3 were 96, 63, and 55% identical to the sequence of human HS6ST, respectively. These data sugges"

We show here that ectopic expression of BRCA1 using an adenovirus vector (Ad-BRCA1) leads to dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein accompanied by a decrease in cyclin-dependent kinase activity. Flow cytometric analysis on Ad-BRCA1-infected cells revealed a G1 or G2 phase accumulation. High density cDNA array screening of colon, lung, and breast cancer cells identified several genes affected by BRCA1 expression in a p53-independent manner, including DNA damage response genes and genes involved in cell cycle control. Notable changes included induction of the GADD45 and GADD153 genes and a reduction in cyclin B1 expression. Therefore, BRCA1 has the potential to modulate the expression of genes and function of proteins involved in cell cycle control and DNA damage response pathways.

At least half of familial breast cancer cases can be linked to mutations within theBrca1 gene (2.Futreal P.A. Liu Q. Shattuck-Eidens D. Cochran C. Harshman K. Tavtigian S. Bennett L.M. Haugen-Strano A. Swensen J. Miki Y. Eddington K. McClure M. Frye C. Weaver-Feldhaus J. Ding W. Gholami Z. Soederkvist P. Terry L. Jhanwar S. Berchuck A. Iglehart J.D. Marks J. Ballinger D.G. Barrett J.C. Skolnick M.H. Kamb A. Wiseman R. Science. 1994; 266: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). The Brca1 locus follows a classic loss-of-heterozygosity pattern in these breast cancers, with only the mutated Brca1 allele remaining (3.Smith S.A. Easton D.F. Evans D.G. Ponder B.A. Nat. Genet. 1994; 2: 128-131Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 4.Neuhausen S.L. Marshall C.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6069-6072PubMed Google Scholar). BRCA1 does not share any significant structural or sequence homology to any known proteins. There are, however, two notable domains that give clues to its overall function. A RING-finger motif is located at the extreme N-terminus, and a highly acidic domain is present for the last 100 amino acids of the protein (also known as the BRCT domain), suggesting a possible role in protein-protein interaction and transcriptional regulation, respectively (1.Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D. Futreal A.P. Harshman K. Tavtigian S. Liu Q. Cochran C. Bennett M.L. Ding W. Bell R. Rosenthal J. Hussey C. Tran T. McClure M. Frye C. Hattier T. Phelps R.

Indeed, several studies have recently supported a role for BRCA1 in gene transcription. First, fusion proteins consisting of BRCA1 linked to a GAL4-DNA binding domain are able to activate transcription of reporters containing GAL4 DNA-binding sites (5.Chapman M.S. Verma I.M. Nature. 1996; 382: 678-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Furthermore, tumor-derived mutations within the C terminus of BRCA1 are defective in the activation of reporters in the above described assay, raising the possibility that one function that is targeted in these tumors is the loss of BRCA1 transcriptional activity (6.Monteiro A.N. August A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13595-13599Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Second, BRCA1 is found as a component of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme, linked to the complex by RNA helicase A (7.Scully R. Anderson S.F. Chao D.M. Wei W. Ye L. Young R.A. Livingston D.M. Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5605-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 8.Anderson S.F. Schlegel B.P. Nakajima T. Wolpin E.S. Parvin J.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Third, BRCA1 is able to bind transcription factors and coactivate or corepress transcription, as is the case with p53 and c-Myc, respectively (9.Zhang H. Somasundaram K. Peng Y. Tian H. Zhang H. Bi D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 10.Ouchi T. Monteiro A.N. August A. Aaronson S.A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 11.Wang Q. Zhang H. Kajino K. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1939-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). It is also able to activate the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter both in cells that express wild-type and those that contain mutant p53 (12.Somasundaram K. Zhang H. Zeng Y.X. Houvras Y. Peng Y. Zhang H. Wu G.S. Licht J.D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Additionally, BRCA1 binds the CtIP transcriptional repressor that inhibits BRCA1-mediated activation of the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter (13.Li S. Chen P.L. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Tomlinson G. Osborne C.K. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11334-11338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These data imply that BRCA1 is involved in transcriptional activation with a well characterized mammalian transcription factor, perhaps acting as a coactivator. Because it is also able to induce a known p53 transcriptional target in the absence of p53, the data also imply that BRCA1 can activate transcription with other yet to be identified factors. Cell cycle regulation of the BRCA1 protein has been suggested to possibly control the function of the protein in S phase (14.Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). During late G1 and early S phases, BRCA1 protein increases and becomes phosphorylated (14.Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 15.Ruffner H. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7138-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Upon exit from mitosis, the protein becomes progressively dephosphorylated and decreases in expression. Expression of BRCA1 in SW480 and HCT116 cells results in a reduced ability to incorporate BrdU, signifying a role in S phase entry (12.Somasundaram K. Zhang H. Zeng Y.X. Houvras Y. Peng Y. Zhang H. Wu G.S. Licht J.D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). BRCA1 has also been proposed to be tightly linked to the DNA damage response. Both BRCA1 and another gene product that segregates with breast cancer, BRCA2, are found in complexes with the human RAD51 protein (16.Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D. Feunteun J. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar, 17.Marmorstein L.Y. Ouchi T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13869-13874Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae rad51 mutants are susceptible to DNA-damaging agents. BRCA1 colocalizes with RAD51 and PCNA1 (16.Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D. Feunteun J. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar) to nuclear dot structures after the onset of DNA damage. During this process, immunoblotting has also detected a shift in the mobility of the BRCA1 protein, indicating hyperphosphorylation (14.Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Recent evidence further implicating a role for BRCA1 in DNA repair processes has come from studies showing colocalization with MRE11/Rad50/p95 complexes (18.Zhong Q. Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Wang C.C. Xiao J. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Science. 1999; 285: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). In addition, Brca1-null embryonic stem cells are defective in their ability to repair thymine glycols after H2O2 treatment (19.Gowen L.C. Avrutskaya A.V. Latour A.M. Koller B.H. Leadon S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). This oxidative DNA damage is most quickly alleviated by transcription-coupled repair mechanisms that appear to involve BRCA1. Finally, a targeted deletion ofBrca1 exon 11 results in genetic instability, hypothesized to be due to unrepaired DNA damage (20.Xu X. Weaver Z. Linke S.P. Li C. Gotay J. Wang X.W. Harris C.C. Ried T. Deng C.-X. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). To examine the cellular responses to ectopic BRCA1 expression, we have used an adenovirus expressing the full-length BRCA1 transcript to deliver a high level of expression of the BRCA1 gene to >90% of cells examined. As BRCA1 protein levels have been shown to be increased at times during the cell cycle (5.Chapman M.S. Verma I.M. Nature. 1996; 382: 678-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), we rationalized that overexpression of the protein may amplify and give insight to possible functions and effects. We report that the BRCA1 protein is capable of affecting the status, activity, and expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins and also affects the transcription of genes that are known to be modulated upon the onset of DNA damage. The culture conditions of SW480, HCT116, HCT116 p21−/−, H460, H460-Neo, H460-E6, MCF7, HeLa-GRE, HeLa-S21, and HCC1937 cells have been described previously (21.Wu G.S. El-Deiry W.S. Clin.

Production of BRCA1 protein from pCEP4-BRCA1 was confirmed by transfection into SW480 cells and subsequent immunohistochemistry against BRCA1. pMV60-Bax was constructed first by amplification of Bax cDNA by PCR using the primers 5′-cgggaagatctccaccatggacgggtccggggagc-3′ and 5′-ccggaagatcttcagcccatcttcttccag-3′.

Total RNA isolation and Northern blotting were carried out as previously (24.El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

A BamHI fragment of 1.2 kilobases in size from the plasmid pCEP4 carrying the GADD45 coding sequence was used as probe for gadd45 northerns (26.Zhan Q.M. El-Deiry W.S. Bae I. Alamo I. Kastan M.B.

A 1.3-kilobaseHindIII fragment from the plasmid pMV60 carrying the Bax coding sequence was used as probe for Bax northerns. For the GADD153 Northern blotting, a PCR amplified fragment of 500 base pairs corresponding to the 3′ coding sequence of GADD153 was used. The primers used were 5′-ATGGCAGCTGAGTCATTG-3′ and 5′-CATGCTTGGTGCAGATTC-3′. The GADD153 PCR amplified fragment was sequenced to verify the insert. Cyclin B1 and Pin1 cDNAs were obtained as ESTs from Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO) (GenBankTM accession numbers AI142325 and AI138849, respectively) and cut with NotI and EcoRI to release the fragments. The CLONTECH(Mountainveiw, CA) Atlas human cancer array was hybridized with32P-labeled cDNA probes derived from total RNA from SW480, H460, HCT116, and HCC1937 cells infected with 50, 10, 20, and 20 MOI of Ad-LacZ or Ad-BRCA1, respectively, as per the manufacturer's instructions. Infection of these cell lines at the indicated MOIs has been justified by infection with Ad-LacZ at the same MOIs and finding >90% of cells staining for β-galactosidase activity. Quantitation of hybridization intensity of each dot doublet on the array was performed using Imagequant software (Molecular Dynamics). Adenovirus infections were performed at the appropriate MOIs (defined in text) in 1% fetal bovine serum/phosphate-buffered saline. Preparation of cells for fluorescence-activated cell sorting was performed essentially as described (27.van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Cell sorting was performed on a Coulter Epics Elite counter. DNA content analysis was performed using MacCycle software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA) SW480 cells were transfected using Lipofectin with 0.5 μg of reporter, 2 μg of test plasmid, and 0.1 μg of pCMVβ (internal transfection efficiency control). Luciferase assays were performed as described (28.Zeng Y.X. Somasundaram K. El-Deiry W.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Assessment of transfection efficiency was determined by β-galactosidase activity. 20 μl of lysate was incubated in 353 μl of ONPG solution (45 μmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm sodium phosphate, 0.6 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside) at 37° C for 20 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of 500 ml of 1 M Na2CO3. Amount of activity was determined by measurement of absorbance at 420 nm. A total of 200 μg of H460 and MCF7 protein lysate was precleared with protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and subsequently incubated with cyclin B1 monoclonal antibody. Antibody was precipitated with 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads. Precipitated beads were washed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 0.1% Triton, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, chymostatin, leupeptin and antipain protease inhibitors) and then in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmmagnesium acetate) and incubated with 20 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm ATP, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 1 μg of substrate (purified histone H1 protein (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) at 30 °C for 20 min. 30 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer was added to stop the reaction, and 30 μl of the reaction was separated on a denaturing a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The H460 lung cancer cell line, MCF7 breast cancer cell line and SW480 colon cancer cell line, lines that express wild-type, wild-type, and mutant p53, respectively, were infected with an adenovirus expressing the full open reading frame of BRCA1 or the LacZ gene as control. The use of H460, MCF7, and SW480 cells infected at 10, 10, and 50 MOI, respectively, with an adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase (LacZ) results in >90% of cells staining blue (data not shown). Infection at these MOIs yielded full-length BRCA1 protein as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 1). In the H460 cell line, this was also accompanied by an accumulation of p53 and p21WAF1/Cip1 protein as previously reported (9.Zhang H. Somasundaram K. Peng Y. Tian H. Zhang H. Bi D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar).2 Infection with Ad-BRCA1 also resulted in a hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, regardless of the status of p53 protein in these cells. pRb is known to be phosphorylated by a number of kinases, one of which is cdk2 (29.Akiyama T. Ohuchi T. Sumida S. Matsumoto K. Toyoshima K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7900-7904Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). BRCA1 is capable of inducing the p21WAF1/Cip1protein, a potent inhibitor of cdk2 (12.Somasundaram K. Zhang H. Zeng Y.X. Houvras Y. Peng Y. Zhang H. Wu G.S. Licht J.D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). We performed experiments to determine whether BRCA1 may be causing the dephosphorylation of pRb through inhibition of cdk2. Lysates from H460 and SW480 cells infected with Ad-LacZ, p53, or BRCA1 or mock-infected cells were immunoprecipitated using an anti-cdk2 antibody. A kinase assay using histone H1 as a substrate revealed a reduction of cdk2 activity in cells infected with Ad-p53 or Ad-BRCA1 (Fig.2). Cdk2 protein levels were similar in all cases (Fig. 2). Therefore, BRCA1 overexpression may, directly or indirectly, modify cell cycle proteins that control the G1to S phase transition. BRCA1 has been shown to be regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner (14.Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 15.Ruffner H. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7138-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Additionally, cell cycle phase changes are known to occur upon cellular stresses such as DNA damage, the response to which has been proposed to involve BRCA1 (14.Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 19.Gowen L.C. Avrutskaya A.V. Latour A.M. Koller B.H. Leadon S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether ectopic expression of BRCA1 affects cell cycle control, we infected various cell lines with LacZ, p53, or BRCA1-expressing adenoviruses and subsequently investigated cellular DNA content by FACS analysis. H460 cells underwent a G1 and a minor G2 phase arrest when infected with Ad-p53 or Ad-BRCA1 (Fig.3 A). The wild-type p53-expressing cell line MCF7 also arrested in both G1 and G2 phases with a significant decrease in cells within S phase (Fig. 3 B). HCT116, a colon carcinoma cell line expressing wild-type p53 protein, arrested mainly in the G1phase when infected with Ad-p53. As BRCA1 has been shown to coactivate the endogenous wild-type p53 in these cells (9.Zhang H. Somasundaram K. Peng Y. Tian H. Zhang H. Bi D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), Ad-BRCA1-infected cells were hypothesized to possess a cell cycle profile like that of Ad-p53-infected cells, which appears to be the case in H460 and MCF7 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast to other cell lines, the cell cycle profile of Ad-BRCA1-infected HCT116 cells displayed a large increase in G2 phase as compared with mock-infected cells, with a small fraction of cells blocked in G1 phase (Fig. 3 C). As p21WAF1/Cip1has been proposed to be essential for blockage of HCT116 cells into S phase by BRCA1 (12.Somasundaram K. Zhang H. Zeng Y.X. Houvras Y. Peng Y. Zhang H. Wu G.S. Licht J.D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), we compared the cell cycle profiles of parental HCT116 and HCT116 p21−/− cells after Ad-BRCA1 infection. HCT116 p21−/− cells arrested upon infection with Ad-BRCA1 but appeared to accumulate entirely in G2, as opposed to a mixture of G1 and G2 in the parental HCT116 cells (Fig.3 D). This suggests a p21WAF1/Cip1 dependence on BRCA1-mediated responses, as the G1 population of HCT116 p21−/− cells is almost completely lost. In accordance with previous results (12.Somasundaram K. Zhang H. Zeng Y.X. Houvras Y. Peng Y. Zhang H. Wu G.S. Licht J.D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), more cells are able to pass through S phase after BRCA1 overexpression in the absence of p21WAF1Cip1 (Fig.3 D). Whereas a decrease in the S phase population of cells was observed in wild-type p53-expressing cells, a different pattern was observed in cells not expressing wild-type p53. Mutant p53-expressing cells SW480, DLD1 and DLD1 p21−/− and the H460 cell line expressing human papilloma virus E6 protein, which degrades endogenous wild-type p53, did not appear to have a reduced S phase content upon Ad-BRCA1 infection (Fig. 3, E–H). SW480 cells also shifted to an increased number of cells in G2/M phase. Additionally, whereas p53 was able to cause a rapid apoptosis in lines depicted in Fig. 3, E–H, Ad-BRCA1 infection did not result in a significant apoptotic response within 24 h of infection. The effect of BRCA1 on cell cycle phase changes also was time-dependent (as an example, HCT116 cells are shown in Fig. 3 I). The appearance of G2 phase accumulation was coincident in HCT116 cells with the typical timing of exogenous gene expression. Infection with Ad-LacZ had no effect over 18 h on the cell cycle distribution of this cell type, indicating that the changes seen in cell cycle phase are likely due not to exposure to adenovirus but by the protein, BRCA1, being expressed. Previously published data suggest that BRCA1 may be involved in cellular gene transcription, which may in part contribute to the cellular changes described above (5.Chapman M.S. Verma I.M.

A list of 45 major targets out of a total of 588 genes represented on the array, the expression of which was either induced or repressed are described in TableI. Of note are effects on cell cycle controlling genes (p21WAF1/Cip1, cyclin B1, PIN1, PCNA, etc.), apoptosis regulators (BAX, BAK, etc.), and DNA damage response genes (GADD45, GADD153, Ku60, Ku70, etc.), whereas housekeeping genes, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and β-actin, were minimally changed. Additional array screens were carried out utilizing Ad-LacZ and Ad-BRCA1 infection into the BRCA1-deficient and p53-mutant cell line, HCC1937 (22.Tomlinson G.E. Chen T.T. Stastny V.A. Virmani A.K.

The inhibition of mitochondrial translation by chloramphenicol led to a potent block of myoblast differentiation. Carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone and oligomycin, which affect the organelle at different levels, exerted a similar influence. In addition, we provided evidence that this phenomenon was not the result of an alteration in cell viability. Conversely, overexpression of the mitochondrial T3 receptor (p43) stimulated organelle activity and strongly potentiated myoblast differentiation. The involvement of mitochondrial activity in an actual regulation of myogenesis is further supported by results demonstrating that the muscle regulatory gene myogenin, in contrast toCMD1 (chicken MyoD) and myf5, is a specific transcriptional target of mitochondrial activity. Whereas myogenin mRNA and protein levels were down-regulated by chloramphenicol treatment, they were up-regulated by p43 overexpression, in a positive relationship with the expression level of the transgene. We also found that myogenin or CMD1 overexpression in chloramphenicol-treated myoblasts did not restore differentiation, thus indicating that an alteration in mitochondrial activity interferes with the ability of myogenic factors to induce terminal differentiation.

In particular, mitochondrial events are involved in the preliminary steps of apoptosis (1.Orrenius S. Burgess D.H. Hampton M.B. Zhivotovsky B. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 427-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and inhibition of mitochondrial activity, either by deleting mtDNA (rho° cells) or by blocking translation in the organelle, has been shown to stop or decrease the proliferation of different cell lines (2.Morais R.

Furthermore, the general activity of the organelle, not restricted to energy production, is implicated in such regulation (5.Grégoire M. Morais R. Quilliam M.A. Gravel D. Eur. J.

In addition, mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibition is associated with the impairment of differentiation of different cell lines, such as mouse erythroleukemia (7.Kaneko T. Watanabe T. Oishi M.

In agreement with these data, several pathologies are associated with mitochondrial disorders, even if the links between mitochondrial genome rearrangements or activity and pathological symptoms are not always clearly established. Despite these reports, little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in these regulations. First, the exclusive use of inhibitors of mitochondrial function in previous reports was not fully adapted to demonstrating the occurrence of an actual regulatory pathway involving mitochondrial activity in the regulation of cell differentiation. Second, the nature of the molecular signals underlying the reciprocal cross-talk between mitochondria and the nucleus remains poorly known, even if cytosolic calcium levels have been shown to take part in this mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling (13.Luo Y. Bond J.D. Ingram V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9705-9710Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 14.Biswas G. Adebanjo O.A. Freedman B.D. Anandatheerthavarada H.K.A.

Skeletal muscle constitutes a valuable model for studying mechanisms involved in the control of cell growth and differentiation. Myoblasts cultured in vitro undergo a myogenic development program, including active proliferation, withdrawal from the cell cycle, synthesis of muscle-specific proteins, and fusion into multinucleated myotubes. Experiments with cultured myoblast lines have led to the identification of multiple genetic and environmental factors that influence the establishment and proper differentiation of the myogenic lineage. In particular, the myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs)1 (Myf5, MyoD, Myogenin, and MRF4) form a family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors playing key regulatory roles in this process (for review, see Refs. 15.Molkentin J.D.

Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In particular, high mitochondrial activity appears to be associated with the preliminary steps of myogenic differentiation, and its rise just before the onset of terminal differentiation could characterize the irreversible engagement of myoblasts in terminal differentiation. These data led us to characterize the influence of experimental changes in mitochondrial activity upon in vitro myogenic differentiation. Chloramphenicol, which inhibits mitochondrial translation, and therefore the proper assembly of 4 out of 5 respiratory chain complexes, was used to inhibit the activity of the organelle. Conversely, mitochondrial activity was stimulated by overexpression of the mitochondrial T3 receptor (p43) (18.Wrutniak C. Cassar-Malek I. Marchal S. Rascle A. Heusser S. Keller J.M. Flechon J. Dauça M. Samarut J. Ghysdael J. Cabello G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16347-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This overexpression stimulates mitochondrial genome transcription (19.Casas F. Rochard P. Rodier A. Cassar-Malek I. Marchal-Victorion S. Cabello G. Wrutniak C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7913-7924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and consequently the activity of the enzymes partly encoded by the mitochondrial genome (respiratory chain). In this study, we took advantage of these two effectors leading to reciprocal changes in mitochondrial activity to define more accurately the relationships occurring between the organelle and myoblast differentiation, in the search for molecular mechanisms involved in the cross-talk between mitochondria and the nucleus. Quail myoblasts of the QM7 cell line (20.Antin P.B. Ordhal C.P. Dev. Biol. 1991; 143: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) were seeded at a plating density of 7000 cells/cm2 in 60- or 100-mm coated dishes. They were grown in Earle 199 medium, supplemented with l-glutamin (4 mm), tryptose phosphate broth (0.2%), gentamycin (100 IU/ml), glucose (final concentration, 4500 μg/liter), and fetal calf serum (10%). Terminal differentiation was induced after 96 h of culture at cell confluence by lowering the medium serum concentration (0.5%). Chloramphenicol (100 μg/ml) was added when indicated to inhibit mitochondrial protein synthesis. FCCP (2.5 mm) or oligomycin (1 μg/ml) was added when indicated to inhibit mitochondrial membrane potential or complex V of respiratory chain activity. Cell viability was assessed during proliferation and differentiation by observation of trypan blue exclusion after incubation of the cells with 0.04% of dye (Sigma) for 45 min. QM7 myoblasts constitutively expressing p43 were obtained by stable transfection of pIRV Δ1 expression vector, constructed by inserting the p43 coding sequence (21.Bigler J. Hokanson W. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2406-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) into the EcoRI site of the pIRV vector. Control myoblasts were obtained by simultaneous stable transfection of pIRV “empty” vector. Transient overexpression of CMD1 and myogenin was obtained by transfection of pRSV-CMD1 and pRSV-MgN expression vectors. Control myoblasts were transfected with pRSV-(A)nempty vector. 10 μg (stable transfection) of each plasmid also carrying G418 resistance or 2 μg (transient transfection) was transfected using the calcium phosphate procedure 24 h after plating. The medium was changed 24 h later after three phosphate-buffered saline washes, and amplification was performed after about 10 days of G418 selection for stable transfection. Cells plated in coated dishes (7000 cells/cm2) were harvested in 1.5 ml of TNE (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, pH 8.0), and then centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 ×g. For enzymatic activity determination, the pellet was resuspended in 50–150 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.8) and lysed by three cycles of freezing/defreezing. Total proteins were measured on an aliquot using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Citrate synthase activity was measured according to Bergmeyer et al. (22.Bergmeyer H.U. Gawehen K Grassl M. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 1. Academic Press, New York1963: 443-444Google Scholar). Cytochrome oxidase was measured as described by Warthon and Tzagaloff (23.Wharton D.C. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 245-250Crossref Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activities were measured as specific activities, and expressed relative to control levels, recorded in “normal” and pIRV-transfected myoblasts for chloramphenicol-treated and p43-overexpressing myoblasts, respectively. ATP levels were measured using the ATP HS II bioluminescence assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lactate levels were measured on an aliquot of culture medium using the l-Lactic acid determination kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). These two parameters were normalized in relation to the amount of total cellular proteins; they were expressed relative to their respective control at the same stage of the culture for chloramphenicol-treated or p43-overexpressing myoblasts. At appropriate times, myoblasts were fixed using 100% methanol and stained with Giemsa. Myoblast differentiation was assessed by morphological changes and accumulation of connectin, a muscle-specific marker. After methanol fixation and appropriate washings, cells were stained with an antibody raised against connectin and a fluorescein-conjugated antibody raised against mouse immunoglobulins. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (1 μg/ml). The fusion index (percentage of nuclei incorporated into myotubes relative to the total number) was used to quantify terminal differentiation. RNA levels were monitored by Northern blots. Total RNAs were isolated after 48 (proliferation), 96 (cell confluence) and 168 (terminal differentiation) h of culture, as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (24.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63189) Google Scholar), and 15 μg was loaded in each lane. Membranes were hybridized with cDNA probes labeled using the Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantitation was performed using a STORM phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics) and normalized in relation to S26 levels. QM7 myoblasts were pretreated with chloramphenicol at the medium change inducing terminal differentiation. 36 h later, actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) was added to the medium. Total RNAs were isolated at the indicated times. Protein levels were monitored by Western blot performed on nuclear extracts. Nuclei were collected as described by Schreiber et al. (25.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar); 50 μg of nuclear proteins were run on 10% SDS-PAGE mini-gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were probed with anti-MyoD (C20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, diluted at 1:200) or anti-myogenin (M-225, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, diluted at 1:100) antibodies. These antibodies were further detected by ECF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantitation was performed using a STORM phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics). Statistical analysis was performed using the paired T test (26.Snedecor G.W. Statistical Methods. Iowa State University Press, Ames, IA1961Google Scholar). To validate our experimental approach, we first characterized the influence of chloramphenicol treatment or p43 overexpression on mitochondrial activity. As expected, myoblasts cultured in the presence of chloramphenicol showed an impressive decrease in cytochrome oxidase activity, an enzyme partly encoded by the mitochondrial genome (p < 0.001; Fig.1 A). On the other hand, mitochondrial T3 receptor (p43) overexpression led to a significant stimulation of cytochrome oxidase activity (p < 0.001; Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, neither chloramphenicol nor p43 overexpression affected the activity of citrate synthase or of the complex II of the respiratory chain, encoded only by nuclear genes (Fig. 1 B). We then addressed the question of whether QM7 myoblasts could respond to the inhibition of aerobic metabolism induced by chloramphenicol by activating anaerobic pathways. Lactate accumulation in the culture medium between the third and fourth day of culture, normalized to the amount of total cellular proteins, was found to be strongly increased in chloramphenicol-treated cells relative to control myoblasts. However, it remained unaffected in p43-overexpressing cells (Fig.1 C). We next studied whether these changes in metabolic activity could induce changes in intracellular ATP levels. Chloramphenicol-treated myoblasts showed a strong reduction in ATP levels at the onset of the culture, but the difference between control and treated myoblasts progressively decreased and ceased to be significant after 72 h of culture and during terminal differentiation (Fig. 1 D). No major changes in intracellular ATP levels were induced by p43 overexpression (Fig. 1 D). We also studied the influence of chloramphenicol exposure on QM7 myoblast viability in long term culture. Cell growth was maintained, although at a slower rate, for at least 3 months in the presence of the drug. Lastly, macro arrays experiments showed that chloramphenicol treatment did not affect general nuclear gene expression (data not shown). This set of data therefore indicates that chloramphenicol inhibited mitochondrial activity without affecting cell viability. Inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis did not induce a permanent alteration in intracellular ATP levels, as they were restored just before and during terminal differentiation. Conversely, as expected (19.Casas F. Rochard P. Rodier A. Cassar-Malek I. Marchal-Victorion S. Cabello G. Wrutniak C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7913-7924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the activity of the organelle was stimulated by overexpression of the mitochondrial T3 receptor, without influencing ATP levels. Previous studies have suggested that mitochondrial activity could be involved in the regulation of muscle differentiation (10.Herzberg N.H. Zwart R. Wolterman R.A. Ruiter J.P. Wanders R.J. Bolhuis P.A. Van Den Bogert C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 11.Korohoda W. Pietrzkowski Z. Reiss K. Folia Histochem.

Physiol. 1990; 142: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that important changes in mitochondrial activity occur just before the onset of differentiation, and are not observed in differentiation-deficient myoblasts (17.Rochard P. Cassar-Malek I. Marchal S. Wrutniak C. Cabello G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of the v-erb A oncogene induces significant changes in this activity (17.Rochard P. Cassar-Malek I. Marchal S. Wrutniak C. Cabello G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) before stimulating myoblast differentiation (29.Cassar-Malek I. Marchal S. Altabef M. Wrutniak C. Samarut J. Cabello G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2197-2206PubMed Google Scholar). To clarify further the relationships observed between mitochondrial activity and muscle differentiation, we investigated the influence of chloramphenicol or p43 overexpression on QM7 myoblast proliferation and differentiation. The drug exerted a marked negative influence on myoblast proliferation. Cell numbers, assessed by counting nuclei in control or chloramphenicol-treated myoblasts, increased exponentially in all cultures until the medium change; proliferation was still maintained, at a lower rate, in control cells after serum removal (Fig.2). 72 h after plating, chloramphenicol significantly decreased cell proliferation and hence myoblast numbers (47 and 39% of the control value at cell confluence and after 72 h in the differentiating medium, respectively;p < 0.001; Fig. 2). This influence was not the result of a decrease in cell viability, as assessed by culture observation, FACS, or trypan blue exclusion experiments, in either proliferative or differentiating medium (data not shown). These observations are in agreement with previous results of King and Attardi (30.King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar), who reported that mtDNA-less (rho°) cells were still able to proliferate, at a slower rate than the wild type parental line, when the medium was complemented with uridine (a component of tryptose phosphate broth used for QM7 culture) and pyruvate (present in Earle 199 medium). Addition of chloramphenicol at cell confluence slightly decreased the proliferation rate observed in the differentiating medium. Conversely, removal of the drug at this stage increased proliferation of myoblasts previously treated with chloramphenicol (Fig. 2). Myogenic differentiation was assessed in cytoimmunofluorescence experiments, enabling the study of morphological (myotube formation) and biochemical (synthesis of connectin, an early marker of differentiation) criteria. Quantitative data were obtained by measuring the fusion index. In control cultures, myoblasts began to fuse into multinucleated myotubes 24 h after the induction of terminal differentiation, and they accumulated muscle-specific proteins. Maximal differentiation was observed 72 h after the medium change. In agreement with previous studies on avian, human, or mouse myoblasts (10.Herzberg N.H. Zwart R. Wolterman R.A. Ruiter J.P. Wanders R.J. Bolhuis P.A. Van Den Bogert C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 11.Korohoda W. Pietrzkowski Z. Reiss K. Folia Histochem. Cytobiol. 1993; 31: 9-13PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Hamai N. Nakamura M. Asano A. Cell Struct. Funct. 1997; 22: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), our data demonstrated that impairment of mitochondrial protein synthesis throughout the culture inhibited QM7 myoblast differentiation: myotube formation was almost fully abrogated (fusion index, 0.5% versus 23% in control myoblasts;p < 0.001), and connectin accumulation was at the brink of detection (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, acetylcholine receptor α subunit (AchRα) mRNA levels were shown to be down-regulated, although less drastically, under exposure to chloramphenicol (29 and 50% of control values at cell confluence and during terminal differentiation, respectively;p < 0.01; Fig. 3 B). Such a difference in the influence of mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibition on two different aspects of terminal differentiation has already been recorded by Korohoda et al. (11.Korohoda W. Pietrzkowski Z. Reiss K. Folia Histochem. Cytobiol. 1993; 31: 9-13PubMed Google Scholar), who found that the increase in creatine kinase activity was moderately inhibited when fusion was almost completely blocked under exposure to chloramphenicol. Moreover, such partial disjunction of morphological and biochemical differentiation has been reported elsewhere (31.Hirayama E. Hase H. Nakano Y. Kim J. Cell Struct. Funct. 1995; 20: 377-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As previously demonstrated (11.Korohoda W. Pietrzkowski Z. Reiss K. Folia Histochem. Cytobiol. 1993; 31: 9-13PubMed Google Scholar), we also observed that inhibition of differentiation by chloramphenicol appeared fully reversible: myotube formation, connectin accumulation, and AchRα levels were restored upon removal of the drug at the induction of terminal differentiation (fusion index, 20 versus 23% in control myoblasts; not significant; Fig. 3, A and C). This reversibility was also observed with myoblasts passaged for 3 months in the presence of the drug (data not shown), demonstrating that exposure to chloramphenicol did not alter the myogenic commitment of QM7 cells. Moreover, addition of chloramphenicol to the culture medium only at the onset of terminal differentiation led to an inhibition of myogenesis similar to that recorded with a treatment performed throughout culture (fusion index, 5%; p < 0.01; Fig. 3, A andC). These last results suggest that the chloramphenicol-induced block in the differentiation program is probably not the result of a reduction in cell numbers in treated dishes. To confirm this hypothesis, we increased plating density of myoblasts exposed to the drug during the proliferation phase. In these conditions, cell numbers did not differ in control or treated cultures at cell confluence, and as previously observed (Fig. 3), chloramphenicol reversibly abrogated QM7 myoblast differentiation (Fig.4). All of these data establish that the influence of inhibition of mitochondrial activity upon myogenesis is not the result of a “nonspecific” alteration in cell viability or proliferation but clearly involves a block in the differentiation program. Conversely, myogenic differentiation of p43-overexpressing myoblasts was stimulated, even in proliferative conditions (10% serum), where these cells, in contrast to (pIRV empty vector stably transfected) control myoblasts, had already undergone fusion and connectin synthesis (fusion index, 15 versus 2.6% for control myoblasts;p < 0.001; Fig.5 A). In the same way, AchRα mRNA levels were up-regulated at cell confluence in QM7 myoblasts overexpressing p43 (5-fold increase; p < 0.01; Fig.5 B). These data clearly demonstrate that mitochondrial activity is involved in the regulation of myoblast differentiation. As terminal differentiation is the result of important changes in the expression of a set of nuclear genes, our results also suggest that mitochondrial activity is able to influence, directly or indirectly, regulation of myogenesis regulatory genes. In an attempt to determine how mitochondrial activity could affect myogenic differentiation, we performed Northern and Western blot experiments with cDNA probes and antibodies directed against MRFs. We found that at every stage of culture studied, neither CMD1 (the avian homologue of MyoD) nor myf5 mRNA levels were influenced by chloramphenicol treatment (Fig.6 A). Similarly, they did not differ in control myoblasts and in p43-overexpressing cells, either at cell confluence (Fig. 6 B) or at any stage of the culture (data not shown). However, Western blot experiments indicated that CMD1 is posttranscriptionally regulated in QM7 myoblasts. Whereas its mRNA level did not significantly change throughout culture, the CMD1 protein levels rose during terminal differentiation (Fig. 6,A and C). Moreover, chloramphenicol treatment seems to interfere with this regulation, as it decreased the CMD1 protein levels at cell confluence (19% of control value;p < 0.001). However, this regulation is not a major explanation of the differentiation block induced by chloramphenicol, as further restoration of the CMD1 protein level after the medium change did not restore differentiation. In addition, despite this decrease, chloramphenicol removal at cell confluence rapidly induced terminal differentiation. We also observed in cytoimmunofluorescence studies that nuclear localization of CMD1 was not influenced by chloramphenicol treatment (data not shown). As expected (32.Marchal S. Cassar-Malek I. Magaud J.P. Rouault J.P. Wrutniak C. Cabello G. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), myogenin mRNA and protein levels were at the brink of detection in proliferative myoblasts and were strongly up-regulated during terminal differentiation. However, chloramphenicol exposure drastically reduced myogenin levels at cell confluence and during terminal differentiation (to 26 and 4.8% (mRNA) and 21 and 9.6% (protein) of control values, respectively; p < 0.001; Fig. 6, A and C). Furthermore, chloramphenicol removal led to the restoration of myogenin expression (Fig. 7). Interestingly, we also found that these levels were up-regulated in p43-overexpressing myoblasts (Fig. 6, B and D). Moreover, using different clones overexpressing different amounts of the mitochondrial T3 receptor, we observed a positive relationship between p43 expression and myogenin mRNA and protein levels (6.4- and 2.1- (mRNA) and 9.5 and 4.0-fold increase relative to control values (protein), respectively, for clones expressing high and moderate levels of p43;p < 0.01; Fig. 6, B and D). These data strongly support the hypothesis of a regulation of myogenin expression by mitochondrial activity. To assess more accurately the relationships between modifications of myogenin mRNA levels and mitochondrial activity, we used two other treatments known to inhibit other aspects of this activity. Treatment of myoblasts either with FCCP (a protonophore that integrates in the inner membrane of the organelle and dissipates mitochondrial membrane potential) or with oligomycin (an inhibitor of the complex V of the respiratory chain) led to a differentiation block (data not shown). Moreover, whereas CMD1 and myf5 mRNA levels were not affected, myogenin mRNA induction was abolished by these treatments; AchRα mRNA levels were also depressed to a similar extent (Fig. 8). This set of data clearly indicates that myogenin is a specific target of mitochondrial activity: its mRNA levels are indeed affected in relation to mitochondrial activity in myoblasts cultured in the presence of various drugs that inhibit the activity of the organelle or in p43-overexpressing myoblasts. To determine the level of this regulation by mitochondrial activity, we studied the half-life of myogenin mRNA after abrogation of nuclear transcription by actinomycin D. Interestingly, chloramphenicol did not significantly affect this mRNA"
https://openalex.org/W1964474152,"Measurements of CO2permeability in oocytes and liposomes containing water channel aquaporin-1 (AQP1) have suggested that AQP1 is able to transport both water and CO2. We studied the physiological consequences of CO2 transport by AQP1 by comparing CO2permeabilities in erythrocytes and intact lung of wild-type and AQP1 null mice. Erythrocytes from wild-type mice strongly expressed AQP1 protein and had 7-fold greater osmotic water permeability than did erythrocytes from null mice. CO2 permeability was measured from the rate of intracellular acidification in response to addition of CO2/HCO3− in a stopped-flow fluorometer using 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and -6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) as a cytoplasmic pH indicator. In erythrocytes from wild-type mice, acidification was rapid (t 12, 7.3 ± 0.4 ms, S.E., n = 11 mice) and blocked by acetazolamide and increasing external pH (to decrease CO2/HCO3− ratio). Apparent CO2permeability (PCO2) was not different in erythrocytes from wild-type (0.012 ± 0.0008 cm/s)versus null (0.011 ± 0.001 cm/s) mice. Lung CO2 transport was measured in anesthetized, ventilated mice subjected to a decrease in inspired CO2 content from 5% to 0%, producing an average decrease in arterial bloodpCO2 from 77 ± 4 to 39 ± 3 mm Hg (14 mice) with a t 12 of 1.4 min. ThepCO2 values and kinetics of decreasing pCO2 were not different in wild-type versusnull mice. Because AQP1 deletion did not affect CO2transport in erythrocytes and lung, we re-examined CO2permeability in AQP1-reconstituted liposomes containing carbonic anhydrase (CA) and a fluorescent pH indicator. Whereas osmotic water permeability in AQP1-reconstituted liposomes was >100-fold greater than that in control liposomes, apparent PCO2(∼10−3 cm/s) did not differ. Measurements using different CA concentrations and HgCl2 indicated that liposome PCO2 is unstirred layer-limited and that HgCl2 slows acidification because of inhibition of CA rather than AQP1. These results provide direct evidence against physiologically significant AQP1-mediated CO2 transport and establish an upper limit to the CO2 permeability through single AQP1 water channels.

Proteoliposomes reconstituted with AQP1 are highly water-permeable compared with control liposomes but do not have increased permeability to protons, urea, and other small molecules (14.van Hoek A.N.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7436-7440Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The single channel AQP1 water permeability of 6 × 10−14 cm3/s predicts an effective pore radius of ∼1.8 Å assuming a smooth right cylindrical continuously open pore (16.Zhang R. Skach W. Hasegawa H. van Hoek A.N. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although simple pore models are probably inadequate to describe a protein water channel, it is notable that the predicted pore size is consistent with the ability of AQP1 to admit water but not larger solutes. Expression of AQP1 inXenopus oocytes confers increased water permeability without detectable increases in ion conductance and solute permeabilities (16.Zhang R. Skach W. Hasegawa H. van Hoek A.N.

It was reported that cAMP stimulation in AQP1-expressing oocytes resulted in increased AQP1 water permeability and the appearance of an ion conductance (18.Yool A.J. Stamer W.D. Regan J.W.

Although steric hindrance has been proposed to explain the water selectivity of AQP1, it is likely that additional factors such as electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding are responsible for the absence of proton and ion conductances.Nakhoul et al. (25.Nakhoul N.L. Davis B.A. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C543-C548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that oocytes expressing AQP1 had 30–40% increased CO2 permeability compared with that of control oocytes. Using pH-sensitive microelectrodes, they found an increased rate of acidification in AQP1-expressing oocytes in response to external addition of CO2. It was necessary to microinject oocytes with carbonic anhydrase in order to convert the increase in oocyte CO2 content to a measurable change in pH. They concluded that either AQP1 transported CO2 or that AQP1 expression indirectly altered oocyte membrane CO2permeability. Follow-up work from the same group (26.Cooper G.J. Boron W.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1481-CC186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed HgCl2 inhibition of CO2 transport by AQP1 in oocytes but to a lesser extent in oocytes expressing an AQP1 mutant that lacks the cysteine known to be involved in water transport inhibition. Another recent report demonstrated that AQP1 reconstitution into proteoliposomes conferred a small increase in liposome CO2 permeability, which was inhibited by HgCl2(27.Prasad G.V.R. Coury L.A. Finn F. Zeidel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33123-33126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The transport of CO2 by AQP1 suggested by these studies is a potentially important observation because of its physiological implications. The strong expression of AQP1 in erythrocyte plasma membranes and alveolar capillary endothelia (28.Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Christensen E.I. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7275-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 29.Folkesson H.G. Matthay M.A. Hasegawa H. Kheradmand F. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4970-4974Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) suggests a role for AQP1 in lung CO2 gas exchange.The original purpose of this study was to determine whether CO2 transport by AQP1 plays a physiological role in erythrocyte CO2 transport and in vivoCO2 gas exchange in the lung. Compared with oocytes, the erythrocyte is an advantageous system to study AQP1-mediated CO2 permeability because of its native high level carbonic anhydrase expression and its small size, which minimizes unstirred layer effects. In addition, erythrocytes from wild-type mice express AQP1 protein very strongly, whereas erythrocytes from knockout mice appear identical except that AQP1 protein is absent. Lung CO2 gas exchange in living wild-type versus AQP1 null mice was measured because it is probably the most sensitive and relevant test of whether CO2 transport is physiologically important. Contrary to expectations from previous work, we found that AQP1 deletion was not associated with altered CO2 transport in erythrocyte or lung. Because of these results, we re-examined the transport of CO2 by AQP1 in reconstituted proteoliposomes, using several lipid compositions, different carbonic anhydrase concentrations, and HgCl2. No AQP1-associated CO2 transport could be detected under the conditions of the reconstitution assay despite a very large increase in water permeability. We found remarkable unstirred layer effects in the liposome measurements, as well as HgCl2 inhibition of carbonic anhydrase, suggesting that the conclusions of the published reconstitution study are not valid. Together, our data provide direct evidence against physiologically important CO2 transport by AQP1 and establish an upper limit to the CO2 permeability of single AQP1 molecules.DISCUSSIONThe experiments reported here were done to test whether CO2 movement through AQP1 is of physiological significance. We compared CO2 transport rates in tissues from wild-type mice and transgenic AQP1 null mice. The null mice are grossly normal in appearance, except for mildly retarded growth, but they demonstrated distinctly abnormal phenotypes in studies of renal, lung, and gastrointestinal function. Erythrocyte and lung CO2permeabilities were measured by sensitive methods that can detect <20% differences in transport rates. Despite the large differences in osmotic water permeability in erythrocytes and lung of wild-typeversus AQP1 knockout mice, no differences in CO2permeability were found. These results provide direct evidence against a physiologically important role for AQP1 in CO2 transport. In addition to blood and lung, another possible site of physiologically significant CO2 movement through AQP1 is the kidney, where AQP1 is expressed in the proximal tubule, thin descending limb of Henle, and vasa recta. However, studies of urinary acidification were not informative with respect to the CO2/AQP1 issue because the AQP1 null mice appear to manifest an NH4+ transport/production defect that results in increased urinary acidity (data not shown). Other epithelia in which CO2 movement by AQP1 might have physiological consequences include choroid plexus and ciliary body. Analysis of the rate and composition of fluid produced by these tissues in mice will be a challenging endeavor requiring the development of suitable surgical approaches.The stopped-flow measurements in erythrocytes from wild-typeversus AQP1 null mice indicated no significant differences in the permeabilities to CO2 and the small gas molecule NH3. These data can be used to establish an upper limit to the CO2 permeability of single AQP1 molecules. The AQP1-mediated P f in erythrocytes from wild-type mice was 0.016 cm/s, giving a density of ∼2700 AQP1 monomers per square micrometer. From the statistical analysis of the CO2permeability data, the maximum PCO2 conferred by AQP1 was 0.001 cm/s, giving an upper limit to the single channel CO2 permeability of 4 × 10−15cm3/s. As described above, similar analysis for the reconstituted proteoliposomes gives an upper limit to the single channel CO2 permeability of 3 × 10−16cm3/s. Our results thus suggest little CO2transport by AQP1.In vivo experiments were done to test whether CO2 gas exchange is impaired in AQP1 null mice. Blood-to-airspace osmotic water permeability was reduced ∼10-fold in AQP1 null mice compared with wild-type mice. The experiments here were carried out in ventilated, anesthetized mice in which minute ventilation and inspired gas CO2 content were precisely controlled. The time course of arterial bloodpCO2 decrease following forced hypercapnea was measured as a quantitative measure of CO2 transport between the blood and airspace compartments. In wild-type mice AQP1 is strongly expressed at two key barriers in the CO2 permeation process, the erythrocyte plasma membrane and the alveolar capillary endothelium. At constant minute ventilation rate, no significant differences between the wild-type and null mice were found in the kinetics of decreasing arterial pCO2 following a sudden decrease in inspired gas CO2 content. We believe that measurement of lung CO2 transport is the most stringent test of physiologically important movement of CO2through AQP1, so that a negative result is highly significant and is likely to apply to other organ systems that have substantially lower rates of CO2 transport.The data from our study for the CO2 permeabilities of AQP1-containing erythrocytes and proteoliposomes can be compared with the results reported by Nakhoul et al. (25.Nakhoul N.L. Davis B.A. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C543-C548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) obtained in AQP1-expressing oocytes. Nakhoul et al. reported an increase in CO2 permeability of ∼0.002 cm/s in oocytes. AlthoughP f in the AQP1-expressing oocytes was not measured, reports from several groups predict an oocyte P f of 0.01–0.02 cm/s under similar experimental conditions (16.Zhang R. Skach W. Hasegawa H. van Hoek A.N. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17.Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). The computed single channel CO2 permeability is thus 1–2 × 10−14 cm3/s, which should have been detectable in our measurements. Prasad et al. (27.Prasad G.V.R. Coury L.A. Finn F. Zeidel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33123-33126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) reported an incremental PCO2of 0.0014 cm/s and P f of 0.016 cm/s in AQP1 proteoliposomes, giving a single channel CO2 permeability of 5 × 10−15 cm3/s. Our upper limit to the single channel CO2 permeability (3 × 10−16 cm3/s) is substantially lower than that deduced from the data of Prasad et al. In any case, the results in Fig. 6 showing that liposome CO2 permeability is unstirred layer-limited and that HgCl2 inhibits carbonic anhydrase activity suggest that Prasad et al. did not measure authentic CO2 permeability.The PCO2 value measured in erythrocytes was ∼10-fold greater than that in liposomes, consistent with the conclusion that CO2 transport into liposomes is unstirred layer-limited under the experimental conditions. However, our results do not prove that CO2 transport in erythrocytes is not unstirred layer-limited. It has been debated whether CO2 movement across erythrocytes is unstirred layer-limited, but more recent studies suggest that the membrane constitutes the rate-limiting barrier (34.Foster R.E. Gros G. Lin L. Ono Y. Wunder M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15815-15820Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We note that the conclusions of our study regarding the physiological role of AQP1 in erythrocyte CO2 permeability do not depend upon identification of the rate-limiting barrier for CO2transport across erythrocyte membranes.In summary, the measurements comparing CO2 transport and physiology in wild-type versus AQP1 null mice provide evidence against physiologically significant permeation of CO2 through AQP1. In addition, AQP1-mediated CO2 transport could not be detected in reconstituted proteoliposomes despite their very high water permeability. The permeability results were expressed as an upper limit to the CO2 permeability of a single AQP1 molecule. We cannot rule out the transport of small amounts of CO2 through AQP1 that are below the detection sensitivity of the methods used here. It would be interesting to determine whether the non-water selective aquaporins (AQP3, AQP7, AQP9) have significant CO2 permeability. From steric considerations, it follows that the non-water selective aquaporins might have substantially increased CO2permeability compared with AQP1 and thus provide a sensitive experimental test of whether aquaporins can conduct CO2. Finally, one can consider the possibility that various non-aquaporin transmembrane proteins associated with significant water transport (GLUT1, SGLT1, UT3) might be able to transport CO2; however, the intrinsic CO2 permeability of a CO2 transporter would need to be exceptionally high to significantly increase the already very high CO2permeability of biological membranes. A family of related water-transporting proteins (aquaporins, AQP)1 has been identified in which individual members are expressed in many fluid-transporting epithelia and endothelia. Many of the mammalian aquaporins appear to transport only water, whereas others (AQP3 and AQP7) transport small polar solutes such as glycerol and urea, and even larger solutes including monosaccharides (AQP9) (1.Ishibashi K.

Electron crystallography revealed that each AQP1 monomer contains six membrane-spanning, tilted helical domains (7.Walz T. Hirai T. Murata K. Heymann J.B. Mitsuoka K. Fujiyoshi Y. Smith B.L. Agre P.

Another recent report demonstrated that AQP1 reconstitution into proteoliposomes conferred a small increase in liposome CO2 permeability, which was inhibited by HgCl2(27.Prasad G.V.R. Coury L.A.

The transport of CO2 by AQP1 suggested by these studies is a potentially important observation because of its physiological implications.

The original purpose of this study was to determine whether CO2 transport by AQP1 plays a physiological role in erythrocyte CO2 transport and in vivoCO2 gas exchange in the lung. Compared with oocytes, the erythrocyte is an advantageous system to study AQP1-mediated CO2 permeability because of its native high level carbonic anhydrase expression and its small size, which minimizes unstirred layer effects. In addition, erythrocytes from wild-type mice express AQP1 protein very strongly, whereas erythrocytes from knockout mice appear identical except that AQP1 protein is absent.

Because of these results, we re-examined the transport of CO2 by AQP1 in reconstituted proteoliposomes, using several lipid compositions, different carbonic anhydrase concentrations, and HgCl2. No AQP1-associated CO2 transport could be detected under the conditions of the reconstitution assay despite a very large increase in water permeability. We found remarkable unstirred layer effects in the liposome measurements, as well as HgCl2 inhibition of carbonic anhydrase, suggesting that the conclusions of the published reconstitution study are not valid. Together, our data provide direct evidence against physiologically important CO2 transport by AQP1 and establish an upper limit to the CO2 permeability of single AQP1 molecules. DISCUSSIONThe experiments reported here were done to test whether CO2 movement through AQP1 is of physiological significance. We compared CO2 transport rates in tissues from wild-type mice and transgenic AQP1 null mice. The null mice are grossly normal in appearance, except for mildly retarded growth, but they demonstrated distinctly abnormal phenotypes in studies of renal, lung, and gastrointestinal function. Erythrocyte and lung CO2permeabilities were measured by sensitive methods that can detect <20% differences in transport rates. Despite the large differences in osmotic water permeability in erythrocytes and lung of wild-typeversus AQP1 knockout mice, no differences in CO2permeability were found. These results provide direct evidence against a physiologically important role for AQP1 in CO2 transport. In addition to blood and lung, another possible site of physiologically significant CO2 movement through AQP1 is the kidney, where AQP1 is expressed in the proximal tubule, thin descending limb of Henle, and vasa recta. However, studies of urinary acidification were not informative with respect to the CO2/AQP1 issue because the AQP1 null mice appear to manifest an NH4+ transport/production defect that results in increased urinary acidity (data not shown). Other epithelia in which CO2 movement by AQP1 might have physiological consequences include choroid plexus and ciliary body. Analysis of the rate and composition of fluid produced by these tissues in mice will be a challenging endeavor requiring the development of suitable surgical approaches.The stopped-flow measurements in erythrocytes from wild-typeversus AQP1 null mice indicated no significant differences in the permeabilities to CO2 and the small gas molecule NH3. These data can be used to establish an upper limit to the CO2 permeability of single AQP1 molecules. The AQP1-mediated P f in erythrocytes from wild-type mice was 0.016 cm/s, giving a density of ∼2700 AQP1 monomers per square micrometer. From the statistical analysis of the CO2permeability data, the maximum PCO2 conferred by AQP1 was 0.001 cm/s, giving an upper limit to the single channel CO2 permeability of 4 × 10−15cm3/s. As described above, similar analysis for the reconstituted proteoliposomes gives an upper limit to the single channel CO2 permeability of 3 × 10−16cm3/s. Our results thus suggest little CO2transport by AQP1.In vivo experiments were done to test whether CO2 gas exchange is impaired in AQP1 null mice. Blood-to-airspace osmotic water permeability was reduced ∼10-fold in AQP1 null mice compared with wild-type mice. The experiments here were carried out in ventilated, anesthetized mice in which minute ventilation and inspired gas CO2 content were precisely controlled. The time course of arterial bloodpCO2 decrease following forced hypercapnea was measured as a quantitative measure of CO2 transport between the blood and airspace compartments. In wild-type mice AQP1 is strongly expressed at two key barriers in the CO2 permeation process, the erythrocyte plasma membrane and the alveolar capillary endothelium. At constant minute ventilation rate, no significant differences between the wild-type and null mice were found in the kinetics of decreasing arterial pCO2 following a sudden decrease in inspired gas CO2 content. We believe that measurement of lung CO2 transport is the most stringent test of physiologically important movement of CO2through AQP1, so that a negative result is highly significant and is likely to apply to other organ systems that have substantially lower rates of CO2 transport.The data from our study for the CO2 permeabilities of AQP1-containing erythrocytes and proteoliposomes can be compared with the results reported by Nakhoul et al. (25.Nakhoul N.L. Davis B.A. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C543-C548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) obtained in AQP1-expressing oocytes. Nakhoul et al. reported an increase in CO2 permeability of ∼0.002 cm/s in oocytes. AlthoughP f in the AQP1-expressing oocytes was not measured, reports from several groups predict an oocyte P f of 0.01–0.02 cm/s under similar experimental conditions (16.Zhang R. Skach W. Hasegawa H. van Hoek A.N. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17.Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). The computed single channel CO2 permeability is thus 1–2 × 10−14 cm3/s, which should have been detectable in our measurements. Prasad et al. (27.Prasad G.V.R. Coury L.A. Finn F. Zeidel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33123-33126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) reported an incremental PCO2of 0.0014 cm/s and P f of 0.016 cm/s in AQP1 proteoliposomes, giving a single channel CO2 permeability of 5 × 10−15 cm3/s. Our upper limit to the single channel CO2 permeability (3 × 10−16 cm3/s) is substantially lower than that deduced from the data of Prasad et al. In any case, the results in Fig. 6 showing that liposome CO2 permeability is unstirred layer-limited and that HgCl2 inhibits carbonic anhydrase activity suggest that Prasad et al. did not measure authentic CO2 permeability.The PCO2 value measured in erythrocytes was ∼10-fold greater than that in liposomes, consistent with the conclusion that CO2 transport into liposomes is unstirred layer-limited under the experimental conditions. However, our results do not prove that CO2 transport in erythrocytes is not unstirred layer-limited. It has been debated whether CO2 movement across erythrocytes is unstirred layer-limited, but more recent studies suggest that the membrane constitutes the rate-limiting barrier (34.Foster R.E. Gros G. Lin L. Ono Y. Wunder M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15815-15820Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We note that the conclusions of our study regarding the physiological role of AQP1 in erythrocyte CO2 permeability do not depend upon identification of the rate-limiting barrier for CO2transport across erythrocyte membranes.In summary, the measurements comparing CO2 transport and physiology in wild-type versus AQP1 null mice provide evidence against physiologically significant permeation of CO2 through AQP1. In addition, AQP1-mediated CO2 transport could not be detected in reconstituted proteoliposomes despite their very high water permeability. The permeability results were expressed as an upper limit to the CO2 permeability of a single AQP1 molecule. We cannot rule out the transport of small amounts of CO2 through AQP1 that are below the detection sensitivity of the methods used here. It would be interesting to determine whether the non-water selective aquaporins (AQP3, AQP7, AQP9) have significant CO2 permeability. From steric considerations, it follows that the non-water selective aquaporins might have substantially increased CO2permeability compared with AQP1 and thus provide a sensitive experimental test of whether aquaporins can conduct CO2. Finally, one can consider the possibility that various non-aquaporin transmembrane proteins associated with significant water transport (GLUT1, SGLT1, UT3) might be able to transport CO2; however, the intrinsic CO2 permeability of a CO2 transporter would need to be exceptionally high to significantly increase the already very high CO2permeability of biological membranes. The experiments reported here were done to test whether CO2 movement through AQP1 is of physiological significance. We compared CO2 transport rates in tissues from wild-type mice and transgenic AQP1 null mice. The null mice are grossly normal in appearance, except for mildly retarded growth, but they demonstrated distinctly abnormal phenotypes in studies of renal, lung, and gastrointestinal function. Erythrocyte and lung CO2permeabilities were measured by sensitive methods that can detect <20% differences in transport rates. Despite the large differences in osmotic water permeability in erythrocytes and lung of wild-typeversus AQP1 knockout mice, no differences in CO2permeability were found. These results provide direct evidence against a physiologically important role for AQP1 in CO2 transport. In addition to blood and lung, another possible site of physiologically significant CO2 movement through AQP1 is the kidney, where AQP1 is expressed in the proximal tubule, thin descending limb of Henle, and vasa recta. However, studies of urinary acidification were not informative with respect to the CO2/AQP1 issue because the AQP1 null mice appear to manifest an NH4+ transport/production defect that results in increased urinary acidity (data not shown). Other epithelia in which CO2 movement by AQP1 might have physiological consequences include choroid plexus and ciliary body. Analysis of the rate and composition of fluid produced by these tissues in mice will be a challenging endeavor requiring the development of suitable surgical approaches. The stopped-flow measurements in erythrocytes from wild-typeversus AQP1 null mice indicated no significant differences in the permeabilities to CO2 and the small gas molecule NH3. These data can be used to establish an upper limit to the CO2 permeability of single AQP1 molecules. The AQP1-mediated P f in erythrocytes from wild-type mice was 0.016 cm/s, giving a density of ∼2700 AQP1 monomers per square micrometer. From the statistical analysis of the CO2permeability data, the maximum PCO2 conferred by AQP1 was 0.001 cm/s, giving an upper limit to the single channel CO2 permeability of 4 × 10−15cm3/s. As described above, similar analysis for the reconstituted proteoliposomes gives an upper limit to the single channel CO2 permeability of 3 × 10−16cm3/s. Our results thus suggest little CO2transport by AQP1. In vivo experiments were done to test whether CO2 gas exchange is impaired in AQP1 null mice. Blood-to-airspace osmotic water permeability was reduced ∼10-fold in AQP1 null mice compared with wild-type mice. The experiments here were carried out in ventilated, anesthetized mice in which minute ventilation and inspired gas CO2 content were precisely controlled. The time course of arterial bloodpCO2 decrease following forced hypercapnea was measured as a quantitative measure of CO2 transport between the blood and airspace compartments. In wild-type mice AQP1 is strongly expressed at two key barriers in the CO2 permeation process, the erythrocyte plasma membrane and the alveolar capillary endothelium. At constant minute ventilation rate, no significant differences between the wild-type and null mice were found in the kinetics of decreasing arterial pCO2 following a sudden decrease in inspired gas CO2 content. We believe that measurement of lung CO2 transport is the most stringent test of physiologically important movement of CO2through AQP1, so that a negative result is highly significant and is likely to apply to other organ systems that have substantially lower rates of CO2 transport. The data from our study for the CO2 permeabilities of AQP1-containing erythrocytes and proteoliposomes can be compared with the results reported by Nakhoul et al. (25.Nakhoul N.L. Davis B.A. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C543-C548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) obtained in AQP1-expressing oocytes.

The two proteins are tetramers and dimers, respectively, in high salt buffers, and only 2C5dH requires phospholipids to reconstitute fully the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Amino acid residues derived from P450 2C3dH between residues 201 and 210 were substituted for the corresponding residues in P450 2C5 to identify those that would diminish the membrane interaction, the phospholipid dependence of catalysis, and aggregation of 2C5dH. Each of four substitutions, N202H, I207L, S209G, and S210T, diminished the aggregation of P450 2C5dH and produced a monomeric enzyme. The N202H and I207L mutations also diminished the stimulation of catalytic activity by phospholipid and reduced the binding of P450 2C5dH to phospholipid vesicles. The modified enzymes exhibit rates of progesterone 21-hydroxylation that are similar to that of P450 2C5dH. These conditionally membrane-bound P450s with improved solubility in high salt buffers are suitable for crystallization and structural determination by x-ray diffraction studies.

P450s1 2C3 and 2C5 hydroxylate progesterone with distinctly different regiospecificities. P450 2C5 catalyzes the hydroxylation of the C-21 methyl group, whereas P450 2C3 catalyzes 16α-hydroxylation of the steroid nucleus. A closely related variant of 2C3 that differs at 5 of 489 amino acids, 2C3v, catalyzes both the 6β-hydroxylation and 16α-hydroxylation of progesterone with a higher catalytic efficiency than 2C3. Both 2C3 and 2C5 have been expressed in Escherichia coli as modified proteins in which residues 3–21 that constitute a transmembrane anchor were deleted. When expressed in E. coli, the resulting proteins, 2C3d and 2C5d, exhibit a salt-dependent association with the inner membrane suggesting that removal of the membrane anchor domain converted these intrinsic membrane proteins to peripheral membrane proteins (1.von Wachenfeldt C. Richardson T.H. Cosme J. Johnson E.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The truncated P450s were also modified to include a histidine tag at the C terminus, 2C3dH and 2C5dH, allowing extensive purification of the enzymes from high salt lysates of E. coli without the use of detergents (1.von Wachenfeldt C. Richardson T.H. Cosme J. Johnson E.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The modified enzymes exhibit their native catalytic activity and regiospecificity for progesterone hydroxylation. However, P450 2C3dH no longer depends on DLPC to achieve optimal progesterone hydroxylase activity when reconstituted with purified human P450 reductase. The deletion of the membrane anchor sequence also reduced the aggregation of the purified proteins and resulted in predominantly dimers and tetramers for P450s 2C3dH and 2C5dH, respectively, compared with the octamers or larger aggregates that are seen for the full-length proteins. The presence of a hydrophobic, monotonic membrane-binding site that leads to the salt-dependent association of the truncated proteins with membranes could contribute to the aggregation exhibited by the purified enzymes and to the DLPC requirement seen for reconstitution of the catalytic activity of P450 2C5dH. We reasoned that characterization of chimeric proteins derived from P450s 2C3dH and 2C5dH could identify regions that contribute to the observed differences between these two proteins in aggregation and the DLPC stimulation of catalytic activity. Peterson and colleagues (2.Graham-Lorence S.E. Peterson J.A. Jefcoate C. Physiological Functions of Cytochrome P450 in Relation to Structure and Regulation. Jai Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1995: 57-79Google Scholar) have suggested that the region between helices F and G, the F-G loop, could contribute to membrane binding, which would orient the substrate access channel toward the membrane surface. This is concordant with available information on the topology of microsomal P450s that has recently been reviewed (3.Von Wachenfeldt C. Johnson E.F. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 183-244Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, an anti-peptide antibody produced to this region, residues 211–223 of P450 2B1, does not bind to the enzyme when it resides in the microsomal membrane but does bind to the solubilized enzyme. Thus, membrane interactions or the close proximity of this region to the membrane surface may mask residues 211–223 from the antibody (4.De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Frey A.B. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although reasonable models of 2C3 and 2C5 could be made using the structure of the soluble, bacterial P450 BM3 as a template, the fit and quality of the model in the region of helices F and G are significantly poorer than for other regions of the protein. The region of P450s 2C3dH and 2C5dH that aligns with the sequence of helix F to helix G of P450 BM3 includes a significant insertion of additional, predominantly hydrophobic amino acids (Fig. 1). This suggests that the structure of the P450 BM3 template may not be appropriate for modeling this region. This possibility is bolstered by secondary structure predictions that the F and G helices in 2C5dH are shorter and that the F-G loop is longer than those found in P450 BM3 or in the structures of other soluble P450s. P450s 2C5dH and 2C3dH exhibit extensive differences in their amino acid sequences between the end of helix F predicted by the secondary structure prediction algorithm SPOMA (5.Geourjon C. Deleage G. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and the end of helix F predicted from alignment of the sequences with that of P450 BM3 (Fig.1). In addition, a consensus for the alignment of this region of mammalian family 2 P450s with that of P450 BM3 is not evident when published homology models (6.Szklarz G.D. He Y.A. Halpert J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14312-14322Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 7.Chang Y.T. Stiffelman O.B. Vakser I.A. Loew G.H. Bridges A. Waskell L.

Toxicol. 1996; 9: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) are compared. The F helix also forms a side of the substrate binding cavities in experimentally determined structures of soluble microbial P450s. Mutations in the corresponding region of mammalian P450s 2A (10.Lindberg R.L.P. Negishi M. Nature. 1989; 339: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and 2B (11.Luo Z. He Y. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) can alter both the regiospecificity of steroid hydroxylation as well as the substrate specificities of these enzymes suggesting that this region may be similarly placed. Molecular modeling using the approaches described under “Experimental Procedures” suggested that differences in this region could contribute to the distinct binding orientations of progesterone in homology models of 2C3 and 2C5. As will be discussed later, these modeled substrate-binding orientations correspond to the distinct regiospecificities for progesterone hydroxylation exhibited by the enzymes. In order to determine whether amino acid differences between the two proteins in the region of helix F and the F-G loop contribute to the differences in catalytic properties and aggregation exhibited by the two truncated proteins, chimeras were constructed from P450s 2C5dH and 2C3dH. The results of this study were expected to provide insight regarding the topology of residues in this region as some of the properties examined reflect surface characteristics of the enzyme, whereas others reflect interactions with the substrate in the interior of the proteins. We anticipated that the selection of alignments for modeling would be aided by this information and that identification of the mutations that decreased the aggregation and phospholipid interactions of the enzymes would render the proteins more amenable to crystallization and structure determinations. Two natural restriction endonuclease sites, HindIII and NcoI, in the cDNA for P450 2C5, were used for the construction of reciprocal chimeras in pCW2C5dH (1.von Wachenfeldt C. Richardson T.H. Cosme J. Johnson E.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Two silent restriction sites, PacI and KpnI, were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the cDNA for P450 2C3 to construct the corresponding reciprocal chimeras in pCW2C3dH. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the appropriately altered codons and compatible single strand overhangs were used to replace the native sequences in the two expression plasmids. The expression and purification of the P450s from high salt lysates without the use of detergents followed the procedures previously described by von Wachenfeldt et al. (1.von Wachenfeldt C. Richardson T.H. Cosme J. Johnson E.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The average specific contents of the preparations of P450s 2C3dH, 2C5dH, 2C5/3LVdH, and 2C5/3LVNdH used in these experiments were 16.0, 16.5, 15.4, and 15.0 nmol/mg, respectively. The preparations of single substitution mutants of P450 2C5dH exhibited specific contents of P450 that ranged from 10 to 15 nmol/mg protein. The lower specific activities of the latter reflected the omission of the CM-Sepharose chromatography step for these preparations as well as differences in their levels of expression in E. coli. Human P450 reductase was isolated following its expression in E. coli. Membrane fractions containing the reductase were prepared as described for the P450s (1.von Wachenfeldt C. Richardson T.H. Cosme J. Johnson E.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The reductase was solubilized by disruption of the membranes with 0.3% Nonidet P-40 and purified by sequential column chromatography using DEAE-agarose and ADP-Sepharose as described previously for the isolation of the reductase from microsomes (12.Yasukochi Y. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5337-5344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Johnson E.F. Schwab G.E. Muller-Eberhard U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1979; 15: 708-717PubMed Google Scholar). As the reductase was subject to limited proteolysis during these purification steps, it was further purified by gel filtration chromatography in order to separate the full-length enzyme from the soluble catalytic domain generated by proteolysis. Concentrations of P450 were estimated spectrophotometrically from difference spectra determined for the formation of the carbon monoxide complex with the protein after reduction with sodium dithionite (14.Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2379-2385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of the purified reductase preparation was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the rate of NADPH-dependent reduction of cytochrome c at 550 nm. One unit of activity is defined as the reduction of 1 μmol of cytochrome c per min. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Phospholipid concentrations were determined colorimetrically as described (15.Yoshida Y. Furuya E. Tagawa K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 88: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). NADH oxidase activity, which was used as a marker for E. coli inner membranes, was determined for 20–100-μl aliquots of subcellular fractions prepared from E. coli lysates in a final volume of 1 ml of 50 mm KPi, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mmEDTA. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 100 μm NADH, and the rate of NADH depletion was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm using an extinction coefficient of 6,250 cm−1m−1. Each P450 (10 pmol) was reconstituted with 0.3 units of reductase in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA in the presence or absence of 30 μg of DLPC in a total reaction volume of 1 ml at 37 °C for 3 min. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 mm NADPH. The method used for the separation of [14C]progesterone and its metabolites by thin layer chromatography has been previously reported (16.Richardson T.H. Hsu M.-H. Kronbach T. Barnes H.J. Chan G. Waterman M.R. Kemper B. Johnson E.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 510-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The amount of product formation was determined using a PhosphorImager SI following exposure of the screens to the thin layer chromatography plates. The apparent molecular weight of each enzyme was estimated by size exclusion chromatography employing a Superdex 200HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 25 °C. The mobile phase was 100 mm KPi, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.1 mm EDTA. The apparent size of each P450 construct was estimated from a standard curve determined for the following protein standards: bovine thyroglobulin, 669 kDa; sweet potato β-amylase, 200 kDa; yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, 150 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 66 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 27 kDa; and RNase A, 14 kDa. The elution of the P450s was monitored at 417 nm and that of the protein standards at 280 nm. Cultures of E. coli were grown and harvested as described previously for the isolation of heterologously expressed P450s (1.von Wachenfeldt C. Richardson T.H. Cosme J. Johnson E.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Spheroplasts were prepared by suspending cells in 10% of the original culture volume in a 20 mm KPibuffer, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The cell suspension was incubated with lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C. An equal volume of cold water was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. Spheroplasts were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min. The spheroplasts were suspended in 10 mm KPi, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol and 1 mm PMSF. Incompletely disrupted spheroplasts were removed by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min, and membrane fractions were separated from the resulting supernatant by centrifugation at 123,000 × g for 90 min. The amount of P450 present in each fraction was determined spectrophotometrically as described earlier. In additional experiments, 1.5-ml aliquots of E. coli lysate prepared in either 10 or 500 mm KPi, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, and 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, were fractionated using a discontinuous sucrose gradient. The gradient was formed from 1 ml of 70% sucrose, 4 ml of 30% sucrose, and 3.5 ml of 15% sucrose prepared in either 50 or 500 mm KPi, pH 7.4, containing 1 mmPMSF and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Following centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW41 rotor, fractions were collected and analyzed for the distribution of P450, NADH oxidase activity, and phospholipid. Lyophilized DLPC or egg yolk lecithin was suspended in 50 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT at a concentration of 16 mm. The DLPC suspension was sonicated with a Branson sonifier (Bransonic 220) at 25 °C for 2 h, and the clarified suspension was then extruded through a 0.1 μm Whatman filter that had been extensively washed as described by Huang (17.Huang C. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). The filtrate was directly used for the binding assay. DLPC liposomes (0–13 mm phospholipid) were incubated with 2 nmol of purified P450 in 50 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT in a final volume of 0.6 ml at 37 °C for 10 min followed by an incubation at 4 °C for 12 h. The mixture was centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a TLA 100.3 rotor using a model TL100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). In the presence of the P450, a pellet containing vesicles and P450 was obtained that was resuspended in 500 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT. The resuspended pellet and supernatant fractions were assayed for P450 and phospholipid content. The binding of purified P450 preparations to DLPC vesicles was also analyzed on a glycerol gradient. For these experiments, 3 nmol of P450 were incubated with 5 mm DLPC liposomes in 50 mm KPi buffer containing 10% glycerol as described earlier. After incubation, the samples were diluted with an equal volume of buffer without glycerol in order to adjust the glycerol to 5%, and a 1-ml sample was applied to a glycerol gradient formed by 2 ml of 20% glycerol, 3 ml of 15% glycerol, and 3 ml of 10% glycerol prepared in 50 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT. After centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 150 min in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 4 °C, 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Each fraction and the resuspended pellet were analyzed for P450 and phospholipid content. Models of P450s 2C3 and 2C5 were generated by the automated molecular modeling software, Modeller 3 (18.Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar), using the structure of a P450 BM3 substrate complex (Protein Data Base code,1FAG) as a template (19.Li H.Y. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The alignment used is shown in Fig.2. The standard execution file was altered to generate 10 models employing different initial conditions, to repeat the fit procedure three times for each model and to employ the most extensive refinement schedule. A patch was employed to alter the axial cysteine side chain to reflect its interaction with the iron of the heme. Additional restraints were employed to constrain the interactions of amino acid side chains with the heme. Details of the restraints and the patch were kindly provided by S. Modi who had employed them previously to model P450 2D6 (8.Modi S. Paine M.J. Sutcliffe M.J. Lian L.Y. Primrose W.U. Wolf C.R. Roberts G.C.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4540-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition, the heme residue in the topology library was modified to reflect bond angles and bond distances commensurate with those seen in known P450 structures. S. Graham-Lorence, University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, kindly provided the topology file for the heme. Energetically favorable positions for the binding of the substrate progesterone in the active sites of each model were evaluated using the automated docking program AutoDock 2.5 (20.Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Huey R. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1996; 10: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). AutoDock uses computed grids as a means of rapidly calculating the interaction between the ligand and the protein. The program samples translations and rotations around the center of mass of the substrate as well as internal rotations that permit the orientation of the 17β-side chain to change. However, the program does not sample allowable, alternative conformations of protein side chains that form the periphery of the substrate-binding site. These changes may be necessary to accommodate a large substrate like progesterone in a docking orientation that is appropriate for catalysis. For this reason, we examined 10 models produced by Modeller 3 for each alignment as different fits can result in alternative orientations of active site residues. For each model, 100 runs were performed where the substrate was initially seeded at random within the grid prior to the simulated annealing. The results were ranked according to the interaction energy determined for the final position and orientation of the substrate. Structures were assigned to a cluster if they exhibited a root mean square average difference of less than 0.5 Å in their atomic coordinates, and the clusters were ranked according to the lowest energy obtained for a member of the cluster. Each of the clusters that exhibited significant negative interaction energies was examined to determine whether the binding orientation would place a potential site for hydroxylation within 6 Å of the heme iron (21.Szklarz G.D. Ornstein R.L. Halpert J.R. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1994; 12: 61-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Initially, two chimeras were constructed between P450s 2C3dH and 2C5dH. The segment exchanged between the two proteins, residues 201 to 210, 2The numbering of amino acid residues corresponds to that of the full-length native enzymes. Mutations are designated by the one-letter code for the original amino acid followed by the residue number in the full-length sequence of the enzyme followed by the one letter code for the new amino acid. is depicted in Fig. 1. Expression, purification, and reconstitution of the two chimeric proteins indicated that P450 2C3/5dH exhibited the regiospecificity and catalytic activity of P450 2C3dH. In contrast, P450 2C5/3dH did not exhibit appreciable progesterone hydroxylase activity (Fig.3). Examination of homology models in which progesterone had been docked suggested that the loss of activity displayed by the 2C5/3dH chimera might reflect changes to the active site that interfered with the productive binding of progesterone. As shown in Fig.4, when progesterone is docked in the model of P450 2C5dH using AutoDock 2.5 (20.Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Huey R. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1996; 10: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar), its long axis is positioned perpendicular to the plane of the heme. This orientation places the C-21 group close to the site of oxygen activation and is consistent with the selective 21-hydroxylation exhibited by P450 2C5. In contrast, progesterone is placed in the model of P450 2C3 by the same algorithm with the plane of the steroid ring system almost parallel to the plane of the heme. This places the 16α-carbon hydrogen bond close to the site of oxygen activation and is consistent with the 16α-hydroxylation of progesterone catalyzed by P450 2C3. These differences between the two models reflect the identities and orientations of the amino acid side chains that form the active site boundary, as the trace of the polypeptide backbones of the two models are almost identical in regions that form the active site. The relatively large and constrained aromatic residues found in the F helix of P450 2C3 prevent the binding of progesterone to the model of P450 2C3dH in the same orientation that is seen for the model of P450 2C5dH (Fig. 4). With this in mind, two of the substituted residues, Phe-201 and Phe-205, present in the P450 2C5/3dH chimera, were converted back to the native Leu-201 and Val-205 residues found in P450 2C5dH to produce the chimera P450 2C5/3LVdH. As shown in Fig. 3, this chimera displayed a rate of 21-hydroxylase activity in the absence of DLPC that was roughly one-third of that exhibited by the wild-type P450 2C5dH. Examination of the model indicated that a third substitution, N202H, might also interfere with a progesterone binding orientation suitable for 21 hydroxylation (Fig. 4) and contribute to the lower turnover number exhibited by 2C5/3LVdH. When residues Phe-201, His-202, and Phe-205 derived from P450 2C3dH were restored to the native residues Leu, Asn, and Val found in P450 2C5dH, the resulting chimera, P450 2C5/3LVNdH, exhibited the activity seen for wild-type P450 2C5dH when either is reconstituted with P450 reductase in the absence of DLPC. Examination of the dependence of the catalytic rate on progesterone concentration in the absence of DLPC indicates that P450s 2C5dH, 2C5/3LVdH, and 2C5/3LVNdH exhibit K m values of 4.0, 2.8, and 4.6 μm and k cat values of 16.5, 5.2, and 20.2 nmol/min/nmol P450, respectively. These differences in the k cat of the three enzymes could reflect the effects of the substitutions on reconstitution with the reductase. In contrast to P450 2C5dH, the catalytic activities of reconstituted P450 2C5/3LVdH and 2C5/3LVNdH were not significantly stimulated by the addition of DLPC. This suggests that residues derived from 2C3, other than 201, 202, and 205, confer independence from the DLPC stimulation of the reconstituted activity of these 2C5 chimeras. Taken together, these results indicate that residues within the segment exchanged between the two parental enzymes contribute to differences in the catalytic activity and in the DLPC dependence of the two enzymes. In order to examine the role of the individual amino acids in the segment that was exchanged between the chimeras on the catalytic activity of P450 2C5dH, individual mutants were constructed, expressed in E. coli, and purified. Following reconstitution with P450 reductase in the presence or absence of DLPC, turnover numbers for the 21-hydroxylation of progesterone were determined for each mutant (Fig. 5). In general, the single mutants exhibited rates that were similar to or greater than that of P450 2C5dH and also displayed a similar dependence on DLPC with three notable exceptions. The V205F mutant did not exhibit significant catalytic activity. This suggests that the V205F mutation could account for most of the loss of activity seen for the P450 2C5/3dH chimera and underlie the restoration of activity that occurred when the F201L and F205V reverse mutations were made to generate the P450 2C5/3LVdH chimera. This is consistent with observations that residues at this alignment position are key determinants of substrate specificity and the regiospecificity of catalysis by P450 2A, residue 209 (10.Lindberg R.L.P. Negishi M. Nature. 1989; 339: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), and by P450 2B, residue 206 (11.Luo Z. He Y. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, two single mutants, N202H and I207L, did not exhibit the stimulation of catalysis by DLPC that is seen for P450 2C5dH or the other mutants. The N202H and I207L mutations are likely to underlie the reduction of DLPC stimulation seen for the P450 2C5/3LVdH, and the I207L mutation confers this characteristic to 2C5/3LVNdH (Fig. 3). Size exclusion chromatography revealed that the aggregation of the purified P450 2C5/3LVdH chimera was reduced in a high salt buffer as evidenced by a longer retention time, 30.1 min, than that of either of the parental enzymes. As shown in Fig.6, P450s 2C5dH and 2C3dH exhibit retention times of 24.6 and 28.3 min, respectively. When compared with a standard curve, these values indicate that P450s 2C5dH and 2C3dH are predominantly tetramers and dimers, respectively. In contrast, preparations of P450 2C5/3LVdH appear to contain predominantly monomers under these conditions. Preparations of P450s 2C5/3dH and 2C5/3LVNdH also appeared to be predominantly monomers, whereas the distribution of aggregates in purified preparations of P450 2C3/5dH did not differ significantly from that of P450 2C3dH (Fig.7). Thus, the exchange of amino acids 201–210 affected the aggregation of P450 2C5/3dH compared with P450 2C5dH but not that of P450 2C3/5dH compared with P450 2C3dH. This effect on P450 2C5/3dH was not altered by the “LV” or “LVN” back mutations that restored catalytic activity. This indicates that other residues in the segment derived from 2C3 affect aggregation as well as DLPC dependence.Figure 7Distribution of tetramers (black), dimers (white), and monomers (gray) in preparations of P450s 2C5dH and 2C3dH, chimeras, and single amino acid mutants.

https://openalex.org/W1991734376,"Recently a cDNA clone, vanilloid receptor subtype-1 (VR1), was isolated and found to encode an ion channel that is activated by both capsaicin, the pain producing compound in chili peppers, and by noxious thermal stimuli. Subsequently, two related cDNAs have been isolated, a stretch inactivating channel with mechanosensitive properties and a vanilloid receptor-like protein that is responsive to high temperatures (52-53 degrees C). Here, we report the isolation of a vanilloid receptor 5'-splice variant (VR.5'sv) which differs from VR1 by elimination of the majority of the intracellular N-terminal domain and ankyrin repeat elements. Both VR.5'sv and VR1 mRNA were shown to be expressed in tissues reportedly responsive to capsaicin including dorsal root ganglion, brain, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Functional expression of VR.5'sv in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells showed no sensitivity to capsaicin, the potent vanilloid resiniferatoxin, hydrogen ions (pH 6.2), or noxious thermal stimuli (50 degrees C). Since VR.5'sv is otherwise identical to VR1 throughout its transmembrane spanning domains and C-terminal region, these results support the hypothesis that the N-terminal intracellular domain is essential for the formation of functional receptors activated by vanilloid compounds and noxious thermal stimuli."

Studies examining the activation, catalytic activity, and interactions with TIMPs of pro-MMP-9 and MMP-9 have focused mainly on the monomeric form of the enzyme.

A sample (7600 pmol) of purified pro-MMP-9 diluted in buffer C was layered onto four polyallomer tubes containing a preformed 20–35% glycerol gradient prepared in buffer C. The tubes were then centrifuged (63 h, 4 °C) in a SW41 rotor at 37,000 rpm, after which nine fractions (∼200 μl each) were collected and assayed for the presence of monomeric or dimeric forms by gelatin-zymography. Fractions containing homogeneous monomeric (pro-MMP-9M) or dimeric (pro-MMP-9D) forms were pooled, and their protein concentrations were determined from the molar extinction coefficients: for pro-MMP-9M, 103,645 m−1cm−1; and for pro-MMP-9D, 198,609m−1 cm−1 (31.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were iodinated with carrier free Na125I (100 mCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using IODOGEN (Pierce) as described previously (30.Olson M.W. Gervasi D.C. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29975-29983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The specific activities of 125I-TIMP-1 and125I-TIMP-2 were calculated to be 0.035 and 0.045 μCi/pmol, respectively. Ten pmol of purified pro-MMP-9M or pro-MMP-9D were each incubated (1 h, 22 °C) with either 125I-TIMP-1 or125I-TIMP-2 (20 pmol with pro-MMP-9M and 30 pmol with pro-MMP-9D) in a final volume of 0.25 ml. The mixtures were then subjected to gel filtration using a Superose-12 column pre-equilibrated with buffer C. As control,125I-TIMP-1 or 125I-TIMP-2 (30 pmol) were chromatographed alone under the same conditions. Fractions (350 μl) were collected and analyzed for radioactivity in a γ counter (Packard model 5650). The amount (picomoles) of 125I TIMP-1 or125I-TIMP-2 bound to the pro-MMP-9 forms was determined from the specific activity. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (32.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized by staining overnight with a 0.25% solution of Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 45% methanol and 10% acetic acid, and destained in a solution of 20% methanol and 10% acetic acid. Gelatin zymography was performed as described (33.Brown P.D. Levy A.T. Margulies I.M. Liotta L.A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6184-6191PubMed Google Scholar). A fresh tissue biopsy (∼50 mg) (kindly provided by Dr. D. Visscher, Department of Pathology, Harper Hospital, Detroit, MI) of a breast carcinoma was minced into small pieces and resuspended in 500 μl of cold lysis buffer. The pieces were homogenized on ice with a pestle (Kontes, Vineland, NJ) in a microcentrifuge tube, followed by a centrifugation (14,000 rpm) of the homogenate for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). The protein concentration was adjusted to 1 μg/μl of 1× sample buffer, and the sample was then subjected to gelatin zymography as described above and to immunoblot analysis, as described (21.Toth M. Gervasi D.C. Fridman R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3159-3167PubMed Google Scholar), using an anti-MMP-9 rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb 109) raised against a synthetic peptide (APRQRQSTLVLTPGDLRT) from the prodomain of human pro-MMP-9 (a generous gift from Dr. Stetler-Stevenson, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Monkey kidney BS-C-1 cells (80% confluent) in 60-mm dishes were co-infected with 3 plaque-forming units/cell of vTF7–3 vaccinia virus encoding for T7 RNA polymerase and with 3 plaque-forming units/cell of a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the full-length cDNA of human pro-MMP-9 (vT7-GELB) as described (28.Fridman R. Fuerst T.R. Bird R.E. Hoyhtya M. Oelkuct M. Kraus S. Komarek D. Liotta L.A. Berman M.L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15398-15405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Four hours after infection, the medium was aspirated and the cell monolayer was gently washed with warm PBS. The cells were incubated (30 min) with 1.5 ml/dish starving medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine supplemented with 25 mm Hepes and 0.5% fetal bovine serum). The cells were then pulsed with 500 μCi/ml [35S]methionine in starvation medium (1.5 ml/dish) for 15 min at 37 °C. After the pulse, the dishes were placed on ice, the medium was aspirated and the cells were washed twice with PBS before the addition of 1 ml/dish chase medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 4.8 mm methionine). At the end of the chase periods (0–240 min at 37 °C), the medium was collected; the cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed with 1 ml/dish lysis buffer. The lysates were clarified by a brief centrifugation and were pre-absorbed on protein G-Sepharose beads. The lysates and the media were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either a mAb to pro-MMP-9 (CA-209) or mouse IgG and protein G-Sepharose beads, as described (21.Toth M. Gervasi D.C. Fridman R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3159-3167PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer, with or without β-mercaptoethanol, and resolved by 8–16% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. To obtain the active monomer and dimer, purified pro-MMP-9M (100 pmol) or pro-MMP-9D(60 pmol) in buffer C were incubated (2 h at 37 °C) with 25 pmol of heat-activated recombinant human stromelysin 1 (MMP-3, a generous gift from Dr. Paul Cannon, Center for Bone and Joint Research, Palo Alto, CA). The activated monomer (MMP-9M) and dimer (MMP-9D) were then subjected to gelatin-agarose chromatography to remove stromelysin 1, as described (30.Olson M.W. Gervasi D.C. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29975-29983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Fractions containing MMP-9M or MMP-9D were detected by gelatin zymography and pooled. Enzyme concentrations were determined by titration with TIMP-1 and from their native molar extinction coefficients of 99,817 and 191,349 m−1cm−1, respectively, as determined by the method of Gill and von Hippel (31.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). The activities of the purified MMP-9Mand MMP-9D were assayed using the fluorescence quenched substrate MOCAcPLGLA2pr(Dnp)-AR-NH2 (Peptide Institute, Inc. Japan), as described (30.Olson M.W. Gervasi D.C. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29975-29983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 34.Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Each assay was carried out at 25 °C in 2 ml (final volume) of buffer R containing enzyme and and/or inhibitor at the indicated concentrations. The substrate concentration was varied from 0.05 to 8.0 μm. The enzyme concentrations were 0.2 and 0.1 nm for MMP-9Mand MMP-9D, respectively. Substrate hydrolysis was monitored using a Photon Technology International (PTI) fluorescence spectrophotometer with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 328 and 393 nm, respectively, controlled by a Pentium™ computer using the RatioMaster™ hardware and FeliX™ software provided by PTI. The excitation and emission band passes were 1 and 3 nm, respectively. Fluorescent measurements were taken with a 4-s integration time. Three initial rate determinations were made for each substrate concentration. The K m and V max values were determined by non-linear regression analyses using GraphPad Prism™ and examined by double-reciprocal analysis by linear regression using LINEST (Microsoft Excel™ version 5.0). Increasing concentrations (0.07–0.3 nm) of active site-titrated (with TIMP-1) MMP-9M and MMP-9D were incubated with 1 μm fluorescein-labeled DQ™ gelatin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in buffer D, in a total volume of 2 ml. Substrate hydrolysis was monitored over a 1-h period at 25 °C using a PTI spectrofluorometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 495 and 515 nm, respectively. Excitation and emission band passes were 1 and 3 nm, respectively. Background fluorescence due to DQ™ gelatin was measured with substrate in the absence of enzymes and was subtracted from each trace. A fluorescein (Molecular Probes) standard curve was used to correlate the fluorescence increase with the amount of released fluorescein. Human recombinant pro-stromelysin 1 was heat activated at 55 °C for 1 h. The amount of catalytically competent stromelysin 1 was determined by active-site titration with human recombinant TIMP-1. Stromelysin 1 activity was measured with 5 μm fluorogenic peptide substrate MOCAcRPKPVE-Nva-WRK(Dnp)-NH2 (35.Nagase H. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20952-20957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Peptides International, Louisville, KY) in buffer R, at excitation and emission wavelengths of 325 and 393 nm, respectively. Activation of pro-MMP-9M or pro-MMP-9D was monitored in reaction mixtures containing 2–120 nm of either substrate and 0.5 nm stromelysin 1 in 70 μl of buffer D at 37 °C. At varying times, aliquots (20 μl) of the reaction mixture were added to acrylic cuvettes containing 2 ml of 7 μmMOCAcPLGLA2pr(Dnp)-AR-NH2 in buffer R at 25 °C. Less than 10% of hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate was monitored, as described by Knight (36.Knight C.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 18-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of this peptide by stromelysin 1 at the concentrations used (0.5–9 nm) was insignificant when compared with the hydrolysis by MMP-9. The MMP-9 (monomer or dimer) concentrations were calculated using the Michaelis-Menten equation and the k cat andK m values for the reaction of the enzyme (monomer and dimer) with the fluorogenic substrate, as described above. Initial velocities of pro-MMP-9M or pro-MMP-9Dactivation were determined from the linear increase in MMP-9 concentration as a function of time. The kinetic parametersk cat and K m were obtained by non-linear least squares fitting of the initial rate dependence on the total pro-MMP-9 concentration to the Michaelis-Menten equation using SCIENTIST (MicroMath Scientific Software, Salt Lake City, UT). The values for t 1/2 were calculated from the following general relationship for first-order reactions:k cat × t 1/2 = 0.693. Interactions of latent and active monomer and dimer pro-MMP-9/MMP-9 with TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were studied using a Fison Iasys™ instrument. TIMP-1 (69 pmol) and TIMP-2 (42 pmol) were immobilized onto activated CM5 sensor cells (Fison), as described (30.Olson M.W. Gervasi D.C. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29975-29983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, 320–380 arc s of TIMP-2 and 310–360 arc s of TIMP-1 were covalently coupled. Binding reactions were carried out essentially as described previously (30.Olson M.W. Gervasi D.C. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29975-29983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The equilibrium constants (K d) were calculated from the rate constants for association (ka) and dissociation (kd) from the equation K d =kd /ka . For biphasic binding K d =k d(2)/k a(1) andk d(1)/k a(2) for the low and high affinity binding sites, respectively. The binding constants for each analyte protein were determined in duplicate using at least six different concentrations of analyte (2–400 nm), in a final volume of 200 μl, where the response increased as a function of analyte concentration. For TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, pro-MMP-9Mand active MMP-9M were titrated from 10 to 125 nm and proMMP-9D and active MMP-9Dwere titrated from 5 to 75 nm. Furthermore, each analyte protein (100 nm) was subjected to analysis using a derivatized sensor cell to determine the amount of nonspecific binding to the carboxymethyl dextran matrix. No binding of the analyte protein to the underivatized matrix was observed. The binding curves were analyzed using the nonlinear data-fitting program Iasys Fastfit™, using both monophasic and biphasic models to obtain the rate constants. Analysis of the data fit the biphasic model, as we have previously described in detail (30.Olson M.W. Gervasi D.C. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29975-29983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To determine the inhibition constant (K i) of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 for the active monomer and dimer, the rate constants (k on andk off) were determined under the following conditions, and from these the K i was calculated (i.e. k off/k on). The fluorogenic peptide substrate concentration for each assay was 7 μm, a concentration ∼5-fold greater than the experimentally determined K m for the reaction of the substrate with MMP-9M and MMP-9D. TIMP-1 (0–30 nm) or TIMP-2 (0–60 nm) were added to the fluorogenic substrate solution, and the assay was initiated by addition of enzyme to give a final concentration of 1 nm for MMP-9M and 0.5 nm for MMP-9D. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 6 min, and the rate of substrate cleavage was measured in triplicate for each inhibitor concentration examined. The first-order rate constant, k, was determined from the intersection point of the tangent to the curve atI = x to the curve at I = 0 where k = 1/t, as described (37.Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar), where the data points gave equal increments of product formation as a function of time in the absence of inhibitor. The first-order rate constant,k, for each TIMP concentration was plotted as a function of TIMP concentration. The slope and error of the slope of this line gives the on-rate, k on , as determined by linear regression using LINEST (Microsoft Excel™ version 5.0). The dissociation rate constants (k off) were determined in triplicate as follows. MMP-9M or MMP-9D (300 nm) and inhibitors (330 nm) were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. These reaction mixtures were added to a cuvette containing 2 ml of a 12 μm peptide substrate solution. The final enzyme concentration was 0.5 nm. The recovery of enzyme activity was followed for up to 40 min, and the data were analyzed as described (38.Glick B.R. Brubacher L.J. Leggett D.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1978; 56: 1055-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The error of the slope of this line was determined by linear regression using LINEST (Microsoft Excel™ version 5.0). The inhibition constants (K i) were calculated fromK i =k off/k on. The primary sequence of pro-MMP-9 was obtained from the Swiss-Prot data bank (code COG9_HUMAN, total 707 amino acids). A complete model of pro-MMP-9 was constructed as described below. The signal peptide was removed from the complete sequence, and the remaining sequence was divided into prodomain, catalytic, gelatin-binding, and hemopexin-like domains. Homology models were constructed using the COMPOSER module in Sybyl version 6.4; the modeling of the three-dimensional structure of the catalytic domain of MMP-9 has been published previously (13.Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). The hemopexin-like domain of pro-MMP-9 was modeled using the structures of the hemopexin-like domains of pro-MMP-2 (Protein Data Bank codes 1gen and 1rtg), fibroblast collagenase (code 1fbl), and collagenase-3 (code 1pex), following similar procedures that were used for the modeling of the catalytic domain (13.Massova I.

Potts J.R. Bright J.R. Phan I. Campbell I.D. Structure. 1997; 5: 359-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).

The demands on stability have kept a selection pressure on immunoglobulin domains to retain disulfide bonds in all germline genes. The disulfide bonds form during the process of secretion in the endoplasmic reticulum. Over the last decade, a wide variety of recombinant antibody formats has been engineered, such as e.g. the single-chain Fv (scFv)1 fragment (1.Bird R.E. Hardman K.D. Jacobson J.W. Johnson S.

These different antibody fragments can be produced in a series of different hosts, ranging from bacteria to mammalian cells, usually by still exploiting disulfide formation in the host secretion pathway. However, it is also possible to express scFv or Fab fragments within eukaryotic and bacterial cells in functional form, at least to some level (3.Carlson J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2638-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4.Biocca S. Cattaneo A. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 248-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 5.Marasco W.A.

A sufficient functional expression, i.e.correct folding, of such intracellular antibodies (intrabodies), would enable them to bind to their target protein and evoke specific biological effects. Assuming that this problem can be solved, intrabodies have been discussed as having great potential in functional genomics as the “protein equivalent” of antisense RNA. In the long term, intrabodies may even find broad therapeutic applications, possibly in a gene therapy setting (5.Marasco W.A. Immunotechnol. 1995; 1: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For example, by first transferring the cDNA encoding a specific intrabody fragment, directed against a viral regulatory protein, into a cell population by an ex vivo gene transfer, and second, reimplanting these cells into the patient, these cells would be made “immune” against infection or propagation of the particular virus. In principle, intrabodies can be directed to all intracellular compartments by encoding the corresponding signal sequence attached to the antibody fragment (4.Biocca S. Cattaneo A. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 248-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 5.Marasco W.A. Immunotechnol. 1995; 1: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Among these different intracellular locations, expression in the cytoplasm is the most difficult task, because of its reducing environment (7.Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1990; 63: 69-172PubMed Google Scholar). This reducing potential prevents the formation of disulfide bonds, including the conserved intradomain disulfides in antibody domains (see Refs. 8.Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar and 9.Proba K. Honegger A. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar and references therein). Indeed, it was found that scFv fragments expressed cytoplasmically in COS cells do not form the disulfide bonds (10.Biocca S. Ruberti F. Tafani M. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. Cattaneo A. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 1110-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The intradomain disulfide contributes about 4–5 kcal/mol to the stability of antibody domains (11.Goto Y. Hamaguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 86: 1433-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 12.Frisch C. Kolmar H. Schmidt A. Kleemann G. Reinhardt A. Pohl E. Usón I. Schneider T.R. Fritz H.-J. Fold. Des. 1996; 1: 431-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, antibody fragments expressed in a reducing environment are strongly destabilized, compared with the same molecules containing disulfides, and a smaller fraction of these fragments is likely to fold to the correct native structure. This fact is believed to be responsible for the frequently observed reduced functional expression level of cytoplasmically expressed antibody fragments, as well as for their high tendency to form aggregates (10.Biocca S. Ruberti F. Tafani M. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. Cattaneo A. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 1110-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar,13.Cattaneo A. Biocca S. Trends Biotech. 1999; 17: 115-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a number of cytoplasmically expressed antibody fragments were reported to show specific biological effects (see Refs. 14.Duan L. Bagasra O. Laughlin M.A. Oakes J.W. Pomerantz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5075-5079Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 15.Mhashilkar A.M. Bagley J. Chen S.Y. Szilvay A.M. Helland D.G. Marasco W.A.

Virol. 1997; 78: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar for representative examples). However, for many applications the observed effects are insufficient, and such intrabodies would require further optimization by protein engineering. Moreover, if this technology is to be applied in a high-throughput fashion in functional genomics, a reliable access to these molecules is needed, and an investigation of the limiting factor is therefore required. A class of proteins which constitute suitable targets for cytoplasmically expressed antibody fragments are transcriptional activators. Their functional inhibition by a specific intrabody can result in reduced transcription of the target gene products, controlled by this specific transcriptional activator. The scFv fragment derived from an anti-p21 ras antibody expressed in Xenopus laevis, for example, colocalized with the endogenous p21 ras protein and inhibited p21 ras -dependent H1-kinase activity induced by insulin (17.Biocca S. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. Campioni N. Cattaneo A. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In another experiment, expression of the DO-1 scFv, directed against an N-terminal epitope of p53, reduced the activity of a p53-dependent reporter gene by about 50% (18.Cohen P. Mani J.C. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2445-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The present study uses endogenous Gcn4p of the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae as a target protein for cytoplasmically expressed scFv fragments. Gcn4p belongs to the family of transcriptional activators with a leucine zipper motif (19.Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2513) Google Scholar) and binds as a homodimer to the sequence ATGA(C/G)TCAT (20.Hope I.A. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2781-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Its expression is controlled at the translational level and increases under conditions of amino acid starvation (21.Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In wild-type yeast, Gcn4p activates the transcription of many genes which encode enzymes involved in amino acid synthesis (22.Albrecht G. Mösch H.-U. Hoffmann B. Reusser U. Braus G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12696-12702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To monitor Gcn4p activity, a lacZ reporter gene was placed under the control of GCN4. This system was used to investigate the correlation between in vitrostability (measured by denaturant-induced equilibrium unfolding of the purified scFv fragment), antigen affinity, and in vivoinhibition of Gcn4p by the cytoplasmically expressed anti-GCN4 scFv fragments. The anti-GCN4 wild-type scFv has originally been obtained by ribosome display from a library constructed from an immunized mouse (23.Hanes J. Jermutus L. Weber-Bornhauser S. Bosshard H.R. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14130-14135Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The antigen was a double proline mutant of the Gcn4p leucine zipper, called 7P14P (indicating that positions 7 and 14 of the zipper domain are mutated to Pro residues), which forms a random coil in solution (24.Leder L. Berger C. Bornhauser S. Wendt H. Ackermann F. Jelesarov I. Bosshard H.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16509-16518Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The scFv fragment prevents dimerization of the wild-type Gcn4p coiled coil peptide in vitro (25.Berger C. Weber-Bornhauser S. Eggenberger J. Hanes J. Plückthun A. Bosshard H.R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), as it also binds the wild-type peptide as a monomer in a random coil conformation. The anti-GCN4 scFv fragment referred to as “wild-type” in the present study has been measured to have a dissociation constant of 4·10−11m from the leucine zipper peptide (23.Hanes J. Jermutus L. Weber-Bornhauser S. Bosshard H.R. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14130-14135Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In the present study, several different mutants of this scFv were investigated. Besides the anti-GCN4 wild-type, a destabilized variant of the anti-GCN4 wild-type, which carries the heavy chain mutation Arg(H66) to Lys (termed anti-GCN4(H-R66K)), served as an example for a Gcn4p binding scFv fragment with essentially identical antigen binding properties, but with slightly decreased in vitro stability (see below). The Arg residue at position H66 (numbering according to Kabat et al. (26.Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest,.in: NIH Publication 91-3242. National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA1991Google Scholar)) is far away from the antigen binding pocket and usually forms a double hydrogen bond to Asp(H86). Arg at position H66 was shown previously to result in higher protein stability than a Lys in the levan binding A48 scFv fragment (27.Proba K. Wörn A. Honegger A. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 28.Wörn A. Plückthun A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13120-13127Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Moreover, a Val-Ala variant of the anti-GCN4 scFv fragment (termed anti-GCN4(SS−−, with the subscripts indicating the absence of both disulfides)] was tested, where both intradomain disulfides were replaced by Val-Ala pairs (L-C23V, L-C88A, H-C22V, H-C92A). These mutations had been previously shown to act slightly stabilizing compared with the reduced dithiol form of the p185HER2-binding 4D5 scFv fragment, and it had been speculated that they might improve the performance of intrabodies (29.Wörn A. Plückthun A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 237: 357-361Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Two additional variants were engineered by grafting (30.Jones P.T. Dear P.H. Foote J. Neuberger M.S. Winter G. Nature. 1986; 321: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar) the anti-GCN4 wild-type CDR (complementarity determining region) loops to another framework. As the acceptor framework we chose the so-called “hybrid” scFv (31.Wörn A. Plückthun A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8739-8750Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This acceptor framework is composed of the VL domain of the 4D5 scFv fragment and the VHdomain of the A48++(H2) scFv fragment, with the superscript indicating the presence of both disulfide bonds. It had been rationally designed from a series of stabilized domains and stands out for its extraordinary stability, as demonstrated by denaturant induced equilibrium unfolding, and a high expression yield (31.Wörn A. Plückthun A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8739-8750Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Two CDR-grafted variants with the anti-GCN4 scFv CDRs and the hybrid scFv framework were prepared by total gene synthesis. As the anti-GCN4 wild-type loop donor carried a λ light chain, while the acceptor hybrid framework carried a κ light chain, the loop grafting was not straightforward. Therefore, two different variants were designed, one more “κ-like” (termed κ-graft), the other more “λ-like” (termed λ-graft) (see Fig. 1). These two variants differ only in seven residues in the VH-VL interface region (Fig. 1 d), potentially influencing the orientation of the two domains to each other. The design of the two graft variants is described in more detail in the following section and discussed later. The ampicillin-binding scFv fragment AL5 2A. Krebber, J. Burmester, and A. Plükthun, unpublished data. served as a negative control for a scFv fragment not binding Gcn4p. The structures of the anti-GCN4 antibody and the 4D5-A48 hybrid scFv were predicted by homology modeling using the Homology, Biopolymer, and Discover modules of the program InsightII version 95 (Biosym/MSI, San Diego, CA). The anti-GCN4 VL model was based on the structure of antibody B1–8 (PDB entry 1a6v, 1.8-Å resolution, 96% sequence identity, 98% similarity). The VH domain was modeled after the structure of antibody nmc-4 (PDB entry 1oak, 2.2-Å resolution, 86% identity, 90% similarity). The hybrid VL domain is almost identical to the 4D5 version 8, PDB entry 1fvc, 2.2-Å resolution, 98% identity, 99% similarity) and the hybrid VH domain model was based on the structure of antibody J539 (PDB entry 2fbj, 1.95-Å resolution, 85% identity, 87% similarity). Additional templates were used to model the CDR3 loops of the heavy chains. The VL and VHdomains of the loop donor anti-GCN4 were superimposed on the corresponding domains of the framework donor (the 4D5-A48 hybrid), using a least squares fit of the Cα-coordinates of residues L3–L7, L20–L24, L33–L39, L43–L49, L62–L66, L71–L75, L84–L90, and L97–L103 (VL) and residues H3–H7, H20–H24, H35a–H40, H44–H50, H67–H71, H78–H82, H88–H94, and H102–H108 (VH), which represent the structurally least variable positions of the Ig variable domains. The sequences of the loop donor and the framework donor are very dissimilar: 43% identity (49% similarity) in the case of the VL (one a λ and the other a κ chain) and 47% identity (69% similarity) in the case of VH. The sequence of the two grafts (Fig. 1 d) was determined by detailed analysis of the potential structural effects of any residue substitution. All scFv fragments were in a VL-VHorientation with a 20-mer linker (GGGGSGGGGSGGGGSSGGGS) and a C-terminal His5-tag. The scFv fragments expressed in yeast were cloned into the pESBA-Act expression vector, which carries a 2μ origin with a TRP1 selection marker and a constitutive actin-1 promoter 3A. Barberis, unpublished data. (detailed information available upon request). All scFv fragments were cloned viaBsp120I and StuI restriction sites and carried a C-terminal His5-tag. Two amino acids (Gly-Pro) encoding theBsp120I site had to be included at the N terminus, after the initiating Met residue. In vitro stability measurements of the different scFv fragments were performed with purified protein, expressed in bacteria. The anti-GCN4 wild-type was cloned into the expression vector pAK400 (32.Krebber A. Bornhauser S. Burmester J. Honegger A. Willuda J. Bosshard H.R. Plückthun A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 201: 35-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and periplasmically expressed in E. coli JM83 (λ−, ara, Δ(lac, proAB),rpsL, thi, Φ80, dlacZΔM15) at 25 °C (33.Knappik A. Krebber C. Plückthun A. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The H-R66K mutant, the two different graft variants as well as the hybrid framework, which were also periplasmically expressed under the same conditions, were cloned into the expression vector pIG6 (34.Ge L. Knappik A. Pack P. Freund C. Plückthun A. Borrebaeck C.A.K. Antibody Engineering. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 229-266Google Scholar). The Val-Ala variant of anti-GCN4 was cloned into the expression vector pTFT74 (34.Ge L. Knappik A. Pack P. Freund C. Plückthun A. Borrebaeck C.A.K. Antibody Engineering. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 229-266Google Scholar, 35.Freund C. Ross A. Guth B. Plückthun A. Holak T.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and cytoplasmically expressed as insoluble inclusion body protein in E. coli BL21DE3 (F−,ompT −, rB−mB− (λimm21,lacI, lacUV5, T7 pol, int)) (36.Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar). Periplasmically expressed scFv fragments were purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (making use of the C-terminal His5-tag) and further purified by affinity chromatography on GCN4–7P14P as described (23.Hanes J. Jermutus L. Weber-Bornhauser S. Bosshard H.R. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14130-14135Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Refolding of the cytoplasmically expressed anti-GCN4(SS−−) was attempted at three different pH values (pH 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0) as described for the disulfide-free A48 variants (27.Proba K. Wörn A. Honegger A. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and the 2-fold diluted refolding mixture was directly purified by affinity chromatography. Buffer exchange for all purified proteins was performed via PD-10 gel filtration columns from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech after concentrating the peak fractions eluting from the affinity column in Centriprep concentrators from Millipore. GdnHCl-induced denaturation was followed by recording the intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra of the proteins. Excitation was at 280 nm. Measurements were performed and analyzed as described before (27.Proba K. Wörn A. Honegger A. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were 5 μg/ml in all cases and all measurements were performed in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl at 20 °C, using a Shimadzu RF-5000 spectrofluorimeter. Denaturation curves were normalized as described (31.Wörn A. Plückthun A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8739-8750Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In principle, an estimate of the free energy of folding can be obtained from equilibrium denaturation curves (37.Pace C.N. Trends Biotechnol. 1990; 8: 93-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). However, the free energy calculation was not performed for the proteins under investigation, as this calculation requires the proteins to follow a two-state transition or at least two clearly separable transitions, which was clearly not the case for all scFv fragments. In a series of multiple transitions the scFv loses its functionality with the first transition. Thus, the estimated onset of denaturation in the transition curves (arbitrary defined as the GdnHCl concentration, where the normalized emission maximum was 0.05, see Fig.2) was used as a semiquantitative estimate of in vitro stability. This procedure clearly does not provide an exact quantitative estimate of thermodynamic stabilities, but it does allow a qualitative ranking of in vitro stabilities for all different scFv variants. Antigen binding affinities of anti-GCN4, anti-GCN4(H-R66K), and the λ variant of the graft were determined in solution by the inhibition BIAcore method as described previously (23.Hanes J. Jermutus L. Weber-Bornhauser S. Bosshard H.R. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14130-14135Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), with K D and the active scFv concentration as variables to be fitted. Measurements were performed in duplicate in HBST buffer at pH 7.2, and averaged values are given. Preliminary enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measurements (data not shown) had indicated that the κ-graft variant was of much lower affinity than the other scFvs. Therefore, the affinity determination by the inhibition BIAcore method would have required prohibitive amounts of sample. Instead, the affinity of this mutant was determined directly from kinetic analysis with scFv concentrations between 1 and 400 nm. Even though all scFvs were analyzed by SMART gel chromatography and found to be monomeric at 100 μg/ml (data not shown), the kinetic analysis of the κ-graft variant suggests scFv dimerization occurring for this variant on the immobilized antigen in the flow cell, using the same chip as for the inhibition BIAcore (23.Hanes J. Jermutus L. Weber-Bornhauser S. Bosshard H.R. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14130-14135Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The kinetics were evaluated with a dimerizing analyte model, in which both monomer and dimer are allowed to bind, using a global fit with the program CLAMP (38.Morton T.A. Myszka D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 295: 268-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 39.Myszka D.G. Morton T.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 149-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). While the global fit demands the dissociation constant of the monomer to be in the low micromolar range (consistent with the ELISA data; data not shown), there is some uncertainty about the exact value due to the complexity of the kinetics. The integrating reporter plasmid pAB183 was derived from pJP161 (40.Barberis A. Pearlberg J. Simkovich N. Farrell S. Reinagel P. Bamdad C. Sigal G. Ptashne M. Cell. 1995; 81: 359-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) by cloning two Gcn4p-binding sites at position 150 upstream of the TATA box of the GAL1 promoter. The Gcn4p-binding sites were generated by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides having a 5′SphI and 3′ SalI compatible overhang sequence. The oligonucleotides are as follows: 5′-CCTATGACTCATCCAGTTATGACTCATCG-3′; 5′-TCGACGATGAGTCATAACTGGATGAGTCATAGGCATG-3′. This reporter plasmid was linearized at the ApaI site and integrated into the yeast genomic URA3 locus of strain JPY5 (40.Barberis A. Pearlberg J. Simkovich N. Farrell S. Reinagel P. Bamdad C. Sigal G. Ptashne M. Cell. 1995; 81: 359-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), resulting in YAdM2xGCN4 −150. Four independent yeast transformants were tested in a functional assay, and all showed the sameGCN4-dependent reporter gene activity. One of the clones (YAdM2xGCN4 −150) was chosen for all subsequent experiments and is called yeast wild-type (to be distinguished from thegcn4 knock-out strain). Disruption of the endogenous GCN4 gene was performed by replacing the GCN4 open reading frame with the kanMX4 module, according to the PCR-based gene deletion strategy described by Wach et al. (41.Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). The kanMX4 module was amplified by PCR using primers homologous to either upstream sequences of theGCN4 open reading frame (GCN4 uptag primer: 5′-GTTTCGGCTCGCTGTCTTACCTTTTAAAATCTTCTACTTCTTGACCGTACGCTGCAGGTCGAC-3′) or downstream (GCN4 downtag primer: 5′-CAGAACATACGGCAGATTATAAATGCGTGGTGTAAAATTCTACTTATCGATGAATTCGAGCTCG-3′). YAdM2xGCN4 −150 was transformed with the PCR product using the lithium acetate method, following standard protocols, to generate YAdM2xGCN4 −150, gcn4::KAN. Transformants were grown on YPD plates for 24 h and subsequently replica plated on YPD plates containing 200 μg/ml geneticin (G418). Deletion of the GCN4 open reading frame was confirmed for eight G418-resistant clones by analytical PCR of genomic DNA with primers annealing in the kanMX4 cassette and the flanking genomic regions on both sides of the integration site. The open reading frame of GCN4 flanked by 1.25-kilobase upstream regulatory and 300-base pair downstream sequences was initially amplified by PCR using Pfu Polymerase (Stratagene) and yeast genomic DNA as template. The primers contain aSphI site convenient for cloning into YEplac 181 (42.Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar), resulting in pAdM012gcn4-2μ. The complete GCN4 protein coding sequence was then amplified by PCR (Pfu Polymerase, Stratagene) from yeast genomic DNA with primers containing a HindIII site and cloned into pGAD424 (CLONTECH), resulting in pAdM008. Substitution of Asp-255 and Ser-262 into prolines (corresponding to positions 7 and 14 of the leucine zipper domain, named 7P14P (24.Leder L. Berger C. Bornhauser S. Wendt H. Ackermann F. Jelesarov I. Bosshard H.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16509-16518Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)) was performed by site-directed mutagenesis using pAdM008 as template for the PCR reaction. This mutant GCN4 was subsequently cloned into pGAD424 (CLONTECH) resulting in pAdM010. In order to express the GCN4 mutant under its own promoter, pAdM012gcn4-2μ and pAdM010 were digested withBamHI-SphI, and the appropriateSphI-BamHI DNA fragments of about 1.4 kilobases from pAdM010 and 1.3 kilobases from pAdM012GCN4-2μ were subcloned into Yeplac181 (42.Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar) linearized with SphI. The β-galactosidase assay in solution was performed using permeabilized cells as described (43.Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 169-173Google Scholar). Activity was normalized to the number of cells assayed. All measurements were performed in triplicate, and averaged values are given. The β-galactosidase reporter assay was performed with the different scFv fragments expressed in the wild-type yeast strain as well as in agcn4 deletion strain. Experiments in the knock-out strain were done in the absence of any GCN4, in the presence ofGCN4 episomally expressed on the pAsM012GCN4 −2μ plasmid, or in the presence of the mutant form 7P14P ofGCN4 (24.Leder L. Berger C. Bornhauser S. Wendt H. Ackermann F. Jelesarov I. Bosshard H.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16509-16518Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), unable to dimerize, expressed in the same vector. The reporter activity in the absence of any scFv was about 2-fold higher in the wild-type strain than in the knock-out strain harboring pAdM012GCN4-2μ plasmid and expressing GCN4in-trans (data not shown). Thus, normalized β-galactosidase activity driven by either endogenous GCN4 or episomal GCN4expressed from pAdM012GCN4 −2μ was arbitrarily set to 100% to compare the relative effects of coexpressed scFv variants in the wild-type and gcn4 knock-out yeast strain. The solubility of the different anti-GCN4 scFv fragments was analyzed by Western blot. Five-"

Herein we reveal that deletion mutants of βTrCP1 and βTrCP2 lacking the F-box domain suppressed ubiquitination and destruction of pIκBα as well as transcriptional activation of NF-κB. The ectopically expressed βTrCP1 and βTrCP2 formed both homodimer and heterodimer complexes without displaying the trimer complex. Dimerization of βTrCP1 and/or βTrCP2 takes place at their conserved NH2-terminal regions, termed a “D-domain” (for dimerization domain), located upstream of the F-box domain. The D-domain was necessary and sufficient for the dimer formation. Intriguingly, the βTrCP homodimer, but not the heterodimer, was selectively recruited to pIκBα induced by TNF-α. These results indicate that not only βTrCP1 but also βTrCP2 participates in the ubiquitination-dependent destruction of IκBα by forming SCFβTrCP1-βTrCP1 and SCFβTrCP2-βTrCP2 ubiquitin-ligase complexes.

Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). The prototypical inducible NF-κB, consisting of two distinct subunits, p50 and p65, normally exists as an inactive form because of association with its protein inhibitor, termed IκB in the cytoplasmic compartment of many types of cells (2.Ghosh S. May M. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). IκB prevents the transportation of NF-κB into the nucleus by masking the nuclear localization signal of NF-κB (3.Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). Therefore, major processes in regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway occur in the cytoplasm of cells in order to release negative control by IκB. The tremendous progress in delineating the molecular mechanisms of NF-κB activation has revealed that two important steps are responsible for the immediate removal of IκB associated with NF-κB: phosphorylation and subsequent proteolytic destruction of IκB. Phosphorylation of two serine residues (Ser-32 and Ser-36) near the NH2 terminus of IκBα, one of the best characterized members of the structurally and functionally related IκB protein family, is essential for targeting IκBα for signal-promoted destruction (4.Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 5.Chen Z.J. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). This specific phosphorylation of IκBα is catalyzed by an unusually large, multiprotein kinase complex, termed IκB kinase, with an apparent molecular mass of 700–900 kDa (6.Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 7.DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of IκBα by an IκB kinase complex is necessary for its polyubiquitination at residues Lys-21 and Lys-22 (9.Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Chen Z. Maniatis T. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 1996; 271: 376-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin (Ub)1-proteasome system then plays the next indispensable role for down-regulating IκBα at the physiological level (6.Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 11.Traenckner E.B.-M. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Ub is a landmark molecule in a post-translational protein modification system which plays a central role in intracellular protein breakdown (13.Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar, 14.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar, 15.Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Protein ubiquitination is initiated by the formation of a high energy thioester bond between Ub and an E1 (Ub-activating enzyme) in a reaction that requires ATP hydrolysis. The activated Ub is then transferred to an E2 (Ub-conjugating enzyme). In some cases, E2 directly transfers Ub to target proteins, but the reaction often requires the participation of an E3 (Ub-ligating enzyme). Finally, a poly-Ub chain is formed by linking the COOH terminus of one Ub to a Lys residue within another Ub. The resultant poly-Ub chain acts as a degradation signal for proteolytic attack by the 26 S proteasome, a eukaryotic ATP-dependent 2-MDa protease complex (16.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar, 17.Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). In this Ub-proteasome pathway, E3, the protein-Ub ligase, presumably plays the most important role in the selection of target proteins for degradation, because each distinct E3 binds the protein substrate with a degree of selectivity (14.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence has revealed that activation of NF-κB is induced by signal-dependent degradation of IκB through the Ub pathway (14.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar, 15.Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar, 18.Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). An IκBα-Ub ligase (equivalent to IκBα-E3) is thought to be the key enzyme to control the level of IκB. However, the long sought IκBα-E3 was identified only recently. The breakthrough for its discovery was a frequent report for Slimb, an F-box/WD40-repeat protein, which negatively regulates the Wingless pathway and Hedgehog pathway (19.Jiang J. Struhl G. Nature. 1998; 391: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Based on its structural feature, Slimb was postulated to be a component of the SCF (Skp1-Cdc53 orCullins-F-box protein complex)-like Ub ligase complex which would participate in the degradation of IκBα as well as β-catenin (18.Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). To date, SCF is known to be a large multisubunit Ub-ligase that has been identified as a ubiquitination factor acting on a number of regulatory proteins such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors Sic1 (20.Feldman R.M.

Intriguingly, the same IκBα-E3 has been found to catalyze the ubiquitination of β-catenin (30.Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Davis M. Lavon I. Amit S. Manning A.M. Anderson J.S. Mann M. Mercurio F.

Recently we reported that the putative IκBα-E3 present in HeLa cell cytosol is recruited to be specifically associated with in vivo phosphorylated IκBα produced by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) stimulation and recombinant IκBα previously phosphorylated in vitro by IκB kinase, causing polyubiquitination of IκBα (38.Suzuki H. Chiba T. Kobayashi M. Takeuchi M. Suzuki T. Ichiyama A. Ikenoue T. Omata M. Furuichi K. Tanaka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We also found that the SCF complex acting as an IκBα-E3 contains not only βTrCP1 but also the structurally related βTrCP2, both of which augment ubiquitination of IκBα when they are overexpressed in the HeLa cells (39.Suzuki H. Chiba T. Kobayashi M. Takeuchi M. Suzuki T. Ichiyama A. Ikenoue T. Omata M. Furuichi K. Tanaka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that two homologous F-box/WD40-repeat proteins, βTrCP1 and βTrCP2, are assembled with Skp1 and Cul-1 to form SCF complexes for ubiquitination of IκBα, which would lead to signal-dependent activation of NF-κB. In addition, ectopically expressed βTrCP1 or βTrCP2 resulted in homo- and heterodimer complexes through their NH2-terminal regions, and each homodimer, but not heterodimer, was found to be recruited to phosphorylated IκBα (pIκBα) in response to external signals. The possible roles of distinct SCF complexes, composed of two structurally related βTrCP proteins during the signal-dependent ubiquitination of IκBα, are discussed. The sources of materials are as follows: MG132 (carbobenzoxy-leucyl-leucyl-leucinal) (Peptide Institute, Inc., Osaka, Japan); okadaic acid (Wako, Tokyo, Japan); human TNF-α (Genzyme); mouse TNF-α (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); rabbit anti-IκBα antibody (c-21), rabbit anti-influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antibody (Y-11), rabbit anti-S-peptide antibody (K-14), mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (F-7), mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (9E10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2) antibody, M2-conjugated beads, and FLAG peptide (Sigma). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Cul-1 and anti-Skp1 antibodies were described previously (39.Suzuki H. Chiba T. Kobayashi M. Takeuchi M. Suzuki T. Ichiyama A. Ikenoue T. Omata M. Furuichi K. Tanaka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To construct various plasmids for the expression of proteins as NH2-terminally Myc, HA, T7 and S-tagged proteins, the following oligonucleotide pairs were ligated into KpnI/BamHI-cut pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen): for Myc-tagged (pcDNA3.1-Myc), 5′-CACCATGGAGCAGAAACTCATCTCTGAAGAGGATCTGGG-3′ and 5′-GATCCCCAGATCCTCTTCAGAGATGAGTTTCTGCTCCATGGTGGTAC-3′; for HA-tagged (pcDNA3.1-HA), 5′-CACCATGGCTTACCCATACGATGTT-CCAGATTACGCTGG-3′ and 5′-GATCCCAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAAGCCATGGTGGTAC-3′; for T7-tagged (pcDNA3.1-T7), 5′-CACCATGGCTAGCATGACTGGTGGACAGCAAATGGGTGG-3′ and 5′-GATCCCACCCATTTGCTGTCCACCAGTCATGCTAGCCATGGTGGTAC-3′; for S-tagged (pcDNA3.1-S), 5′-CACCATGAAAGAAACCGCTGCTGCTAAATTCGAACGCCAGCACATGGACAGCGG-3′ and 5′-GATCCCGCTGTCCATGTGCTGGCGTTCGAATTTAGCAGCAGCGGTTTCTTTCATGGTGGTAC-3′. The cDNAs of wild-type or deletion mutants of Hs-βTrCP1 and Hs-βTrCP2 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with appropriate primers and ligated intoBamHI/NotI-cut expression vectors. The coding residues of the Hs-βTrCP1 and Hs-βTrCP2 deletion mutants were as follows: βTrCP1ΔD (deleted 106–148), βTrCP1ΔF (deleted 148–192), βTrCP1ΔN (141–569), βTrCP1ΔNF (190–569), βTrCP1ΔW1–7 (1–259), βTrCP2ΔD (deleted 81–123), βTrCP2ΔF (deleted 122–167), βTrCP2ΔN (116–542), and βTrCP2ΔNF (162–542). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). For coimmunoprecipitation experiments with βTrCP proteins and pIκBα, HEK293 cells were pretreated with 50 μm MG132 for 45 min followed by 0.25 μmokadaic acid for 15 min; human TNF-α was added for 15 min at a final concentration of 1 ng/ml. Cells were lysed in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4) lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 nm okadaic acid, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (39.Suzuki H. Chiba T. Kobayashi M. Takeuchi M. Suzuki T. Ichiyama A. Ikenoue T. Omata M. Furuichi K. Tanaka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Mouse L929 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. In the experiment, 2 × 105 cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method with a total of 2.5 μg of plasmid DNA containing 0.5 μg of H2-Luc reporter plasmid and various amounts of effector plasmid (pBOS-βTrCP1, pBOS-βTrCP2, pBOS-βTrCP1ΔF, pBOS-βTrCP2ΔF) with an empty vector to adjust to 2 μg. Cells were split into two wells at 24 h post-transfection and then stimulated with or without mouse TNF-α (1 ng/ml) for 1 h after an additional 24 h. Cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured with luciferase assay reagent (Promega) using a luminometer (Berthold). The relative fold activation of luciferase activities upon TNF-α treatment was calculated to normalize transfection efficiency. Recently we reported that overexpression of βTrCP1 or βTrCP2 caused marked augmentation for ubiquitination of pIκBα in response to TNF-α stimulation (39.Suzuki H. Chiba T. Kobayashi M. Takeuchi M. Suzuki T. Ichiyama A. Ikenoue T. Omata M. Furuichi K. Tanaka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To extend these observations, we examined the effect of deletions of the F-box domain of both βTrCP1 and βTrCP2 (abbreviated βTrCP1ΔF and βTrCP2ΔF, respectively; for these mutant structures, see Fig.1, upper panel) for IκBα ubiquitination. As shown in Fig. 1 (lower panel), treatment of TNF-α caused rapid loss of IκBα detected by Western blotting as a function of time after TNF-α stimulation in HEK293 cells. In contrast, pretreatment of proteasome inhibitor MG132 (equivalent to Suc-LLL-CHO) prior to TNF-α stimulation caused a marked increase in phosphorylated pIκBα, in turn, accompanied by a decrease in its unphosphorylated form. This compound also resulted in abnormal accumulation of multiple polyubiquitinated bands of endogenous IκBα within 5 min, and its sustained effect was observed up to 20 min (Fig.1, lower panel). In contrast, in the absence of MG132, the degradation of pIκBα seemed to be so rapid that the ubiquitinated forms could not be detected to any visual extent. However, ectopic expressions of βTrCP1ΔF or βTrCP2ΔF strongly suppressed the accumulation of ubiquitinated forms of pIκBα in a dose-dependent manner. These dominant-negative effects of βTrCP1ΔF or βTrCP2ΔF strongly indicate that both βTrCP1 and βTrCP2 direct the ubiquitination of pIκBα in vivo. We examined next whether βTrCP1 and βTrCP2 are involved in regulating instability, that is, the destruction of pIκBα in vivo using these F-box deletion mutants. As shown in Fig.2, the level of IκBα decreased rapidly within 20 min after TNF-α stimulation (see mock transfection). However, the immediate loss of IκBα caused by the treatment of TNF-α was markedly prevented, depending on the βTrCP1ΔF and βTrCP2ΔF added (top panel), even if MG132 had not been pretreated (compared with Fig. 1). Importantly, ectopic expressions of βTrCP1ΔF and βTrCP2ΔF also caused considerable accumulation of pIκBα (top panel). The transfections of βTrCP1ΔF and βTrCP2ΔF resulted in the accumulation of these cellular levels in proportion to the amounts of transfected plasmids (middle panel), whereas the level of Skp1 as an internal control was unchanged. To extend further that βTrCP1 and βTrCP2 are involved in IκBα degradation, the release of NF-κB was measured by NF-κB-dependent transcription using a reporter plasmid that harbors NF-κB binding sites upstream of the luciferase gene. As shown in Fig. 3, ectopic expression of βTrCP1ΔF and βTrCP2ΔF significantly inhibited TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner, in agreement with stabilized IκBα (Fig. 2). Full-length βTrCP1 and βTrCP2 restored the transcriptional activity inhibited by βTrCP1ΔF or βTrCP2ΔF, although they did not significantly elevate the level of NF-κB activations beyond that of cells transfected by an empty vector. Paradoxically, overproduction of βTrCP resulted in rather partial inhibition of NF-κB activation, probably because of the nature of the F-box/WD40-repeat proteins that dimerize each other with a different partner before they incorporate into the SCF complex (data not shown; see “Discussion”). Taken together, it was clearly concluded that not only βTrCP1, which had been reported by many groups (31.Winston J.T. Strack P. Beer-Romero P. Chu C.Y. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W.

Chiba T. Kobayashi M. Takeuchi M. Suzuki T. Ichiyama A. Ikenoue T. Omata M. Furuichi K. Tanaka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), are involved in the signal-dependent proteolysis of IκBα. It is interesting to determine how the two homologous βTrCP1 and βTrCP2 interact with pIκBα as an SCF complex. To test this, two different epitopes (FLAG and T7 epitopes) were tagged to the COOH terminus or NH2 terminus of βTrCP1 and βTrCP2; then their interaction in transfected HEK293 cells was assessed when treated with or without TNF-α. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged βTrCP1 or βTrCP2 resulted in specific coimmunoprecipitation of phosphorylated IκBα only when the cells were stimulated by TNF-α, indicating that these FLAG-tagged proteins function in cells (Fig. 4,right). As shown in Fig. 4, T7-tagged βTrCP1 and βTrCP2 were evident in immunoprecipitates from both TNF-α treated and untreated cells, indicating that βTrCP1 and βTrCP2 form not only homocomplexes but also heterocomplexes, irrespective of TNF-α stimulation (Fig. 4). Skp1 and Cul-1, common partners of SCF complexes, were also evident in βTrCP immunoprecipitates from TNF-α-untreated cells, indicating that neither complex formation nor SCF complex assembly is regulated by TNF-α stimulation or substrate binding. Each homocomplex and heterocomplex seems to form a functional SCF complex because SCF components in cell lysates are efficiently coimmunoprecipitated (left panel). During analysis of the SCF assembly, we noticed that the anti-Cul-1 antibody exhibits two distinct bands in the immunoprecipitates of βTrCP1 or βTrCP2 in the TNF-α-treated cell extracts but exhibits a single form in those from unstimulated cells (Fig. 4,bottom panel). The molecular size of Cul-1 deduced from the nucleotide sequence is approximately 90 kDa, which apparently corresponds to the smaller band of the two Cul-1 bands detected, indicating that Cul-1 may be modified in response to TNF-α stimulation or binding to pIκBα. Previously, it was reported that Cdc53, a yeast homolog of Cul-1, is modified by the Ub-like protein, Rub1 (40.Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition, we recently found that human NEDD8 (yeast Rub1 homolog) was covalently ligated to Cul-4A by a novel Ub-related conjugation pathway consisting of an E1-like APP-BP1-Uba3 heterodimer and E2-like Ubc12 (41.Osaka F. Kawasaki H. Aida N. Saeki M. Chiba T. Kawashima S. Tanaka K. Kato S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2263-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Very recently, we also found that NEDD8 was conjugated to six Cul-family proteins in vitro (42.Hori T. Osaka F. Chiba T. Miyamoto C. Okabayashi K. Shimbara N. Kato S. Tanaka K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6829-6834Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assume that the larger form of Cul-1 is the result of modification by NEDD8. Next we examined whether βTrCP1 forms a dimer or multimer complex. When three FLAG-, HA-, or Myc-tagged βTrCP1 were coexpressed in HEK293 cells, immunoprecipitates prepared by anti-FLAG antibody contained all FLAG-, HA-, and Myc-tagged βTrCP1 (Fig. 5,far left lane). Similar results were observed by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA or anti-Myc antibody (data not shown). Subsequently, immunoprecipitates prepared by anti-FLAG antibody were treated with FLAG peptide. The eluates were split and subjected to a second immunoprecipitation with anti-HA or anti-Myc antibodies. The resulting immunoprecipitates were used for Western analysis using anti-FLAG, -HA, or -Myc antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5 (right two lanes), the anti-HA antibody coimmunoprecipitated FLAG- and HA-βTrCP1 but not Myc-βTrCP1. Similarly, the anti-Myc antibody coimmunoprecipitated FLAG- and Myc-βTrCP1, but not HA-βTrCP1. Thus it was clear that expression of three independent tagged βTrCP1 resulted in two-tagged βTrCP1 interaction, but not a three-tagged βTrCP1 complex, strongly indicating that βTrCP1 did not form a trimer or multimer complex. Thus it was concluded that βTrCP1 is assembled into the dimeric complex. We next examined how both βTrCP1 and βTrCP2 interact with each other to form homo- and heterocomplexes using various deletion mutants of βTrCP1 and βTrCP2. In this experiment, the S-protein purification method was used. As shown in Fig. 6 A, S-tagged βTrCP1 and βTrCP2 copurified wild-type FLAG-βTrCP1 or deletion mutants lacking F-box or all WD40 repeats (named ΔF or ΔW1–7, respectively; see Fig. 1, upper panel), but not the NH2-terminal deletion mutant named FLAG-βTrCP1ΔNF, indicating that the F-box alone is dispensable, whereas the NH2-terminal domain together with the F-box is required for dimer formation. To verify further that the F-box is not required and that the NH2-terminal region is sufficient for dimer formation, S-tagged βTrCP1ΔF and βTrCP2ΔF were used to test their interactions with FLAG-tagged βTrCP constructs. As shown in Fig.6 B, either S-βTrCP1ΔF or S-βTrCP2ΔF was complexed with FLAG-tagged wild-type or deletion mutants lacking the F-box, but not with FLAG-tagged βTrCP1ΔNF, confirming again that the F-box is not required for dimer formation, but the NH2-terminal region beyond the the F-box domain is sufficient for efficient dimer formation. To analyze further whether the NH2-terminal region is required for dimer formation irrespective of the F-box, two additional deletion mutants, βTrCPΔN and βTrCPΔD, which lack the NH2-terminal entire region beyond the F-box or just the conserved region flanking the F-box, respectively, were constructed (see Fig. 1, upper panel). As shown in Fig.7 A, none of the constructs that lack the NH2-terminal region beyond the F-box (βTrCP1ΔN, βTrCP2ΔN, βTrCP2ΔD, and βTrCP2ΔD) was complexed with S-tagged wild-type βTrCP1 or βTrCP2. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged constructs also revealed that the S-tagged βTrCP1 or βTrCP2 cannot bind βTrCPΔN and ΔD constructs, indicating that the NH2-terminal region is the site for dimer formation (Fig. 7 B). To ascertain that the F-box or the F-box-binding protein Skp1 does not play a role in dimer formation, we investigated Skp1 interaction with these FLAG-tagged βTrCP mutants. As shown in Fig. 7 B, wild-type βTrCPs and mutants lacking the NH2-terminal region but not the F-box (βTrCPsΔN and βTrCPsΔD) bind to Skp1. On the other hand, βTrCPsΔNF and βTrCPsΔF that lack the F-box failed to bind Skp1. The facts that the deletion of the F-box does not affect the dimerization property and that dimerization-defective mutants could still bind to Skp1 strongly indicate that Skp1 binding is not necessary and sufficient for dimer formation. Furthermore, it was indicated that the dimer formation of βTrCPs is not a prerequisite of Skp1 binding. Thus, we concluded that the NH2-terminal region is necessary and sufficient for dimer formation and provisionally named these specific regions needed for dimerization the D-domain. Although the dimer formation of βTrCPs can occur independently of TNF stimulation or substrate binding, substrates may help the dimerization of βTrCPs. Indeed, S-βTrCP2ΔF could interact with FLAG-βTrCP2ΔNF, although the extent was not very strong (Fig. 6 B, right panel). They may have indirectly interacted with each other through the WD40 repeat domain probably via the substrate. Further study is required for the clarification of this point. As shown in Fig. 4, FLAG-tagged βTrCP1 coimmunoprecipitated not only T7-βTrCP1 and T7-βTrCP2 but also pIκBα under the stimulation of TNF-α. This result indicates that βTrCP1 and βTrCP2 form a heterocomplex but does not mean that this heterodimer complex is associated with pIκBα because there is a pos"
https://openalex.org/W2116821504,"Hypoxic injury provokes inflammation of many tissues including the ocular surface. In rabbit corneal epithelial cells, both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-inducible cytochrome P450 4B1 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNAs were increased by hypoxia. PPAR α and β but not γ mRNAs were detected in these cells. The PPAR activator, WY-14,643 increased COX-2 expression. Similarly, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with the ability to activate PPARs induced COX-2 independently of prostaglandin synthesis inhibition. COX-2 protein overexpression by hypoxia and PPAR activation was not associated with a parallel increase in prostaglandin E2 accumulation. However, the enzyme regained full catalytic activity when: 1) hypoxic cells were re-exposed to normoxic conditions in the presence of heme and arachidonic acid, and 2) WY-14,643-treated cells were depleted of intracellular GSH. Consistent with previous observations showing that the corneal production of cytochrome P450-derived inflammatory eicosanoids is elevated by hypoxia and inflammation, the current data suggest that hypoxic injury is a model of inflammation in which molecules other than COX-derived arachidonic acid metabolites play a major proinflammatory role. This study also suggests that increased cellular GSH may be the mechanism responsible for the characteristic dissociation of PPAR-induced COX-2 expression and activity. Moreover, we provide new insights into the commonly observed lack of efficacy of classical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of hypoxia-related ocular surface inflammation. Hypoxic injury provokes inflammation of many tissues including the ocular surface. In rabbit corneal epithelial cells, both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-inducible cytochrome P450 4B1 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNAs were increased by hypoxia. PPAR α and β but not γ mRNAs were detected in these cells. The PPAR activator, WY-14,643 increased COX-2 expression. Similarly, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with the ability to activate PPARs induced COX-2 independently of prostaglandin synthesis inhibition. COX-2 protein overexpression by hypoxia and PPAR activation was not associated with a parallel increase in prostaglandin E2 accumulation. However, the enzyme regained full catalytic activity when: 1) hypoxic cells were re-exposed to normoxic conditions in the presence of heme and arachidonic acid, and 2) WY-14,643-treated cells were depleted of intracellular GSH. Consistent with previous observations showing that the corneal production of cytochrome P450-derived inflammatory eicosanoids is elevated by hypoxia and inflammation, the current data suggest that hypoxic injury is a model of inflammation in which molecules other than COX-derived arachidonic acid metabolites play a major proinflammatory role. This study also suggests that increased cellular GSH may be the mechanism responsible for the characteristic dissociation of PPAR-induced COX-2 expression and activity. Moreover, we provide new insights into the commonly observed lack of efficacy of classical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of hypoxia-related ocular surface inflammation. cyclooxygenase prostaglandin peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors cytochrome P450 rabbit corneal epithelium heme oxygenase hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid leukotriene non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction l-buthionine-[S,R]sulfoximine maleic acid diethylester Eye closure during sleep as well as contact lens wear creates an environment that has been described as a state of subclinical inflammation characterized by corneal swelling, conjunctival vasodilation, and significant levels of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the tear film. These changes are attributed to reduced oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange, leading to corneal hypoxia and subsequent acidosis (1.Sack R.A. Tan K.O. Tan A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1992; 33: 626-640PubMed Google Scholar). There exist a host of mediators that have been implicated in the development and progression of corneal inflammation (2.Bruce A.S. Brennan N.A. Surv. Ophthalmol. 1990; 35: 25-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 3.Smolin G. Eye. 1989; 3: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The source of these mediators may be the injured tissue or infiltrating inflammatory cells. Although the progression of an inflammatory response is generally dependent on the inflammatory infiltrate, its initiation is usually the result of inflammatory mediators released from the damaged tissue. Among the endogenous corneal inflammatory mediators released from the epithelium are the arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids, which have been implicated in the initiation, development, and progression of an inflammatory response (4.Williams K.I. Higgs G.A. J. Pathol. 1988; 156: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 5.Williams R.N. Delamere N.A. Paterson C.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1985; 41: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The relative contribution of each eicosanoid to this reaction is unclear. These eicosanoids are produced by the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX)1 (primarily PGE2), lipoxygenase (12(S)-HETE and leukotrienes, e.g. LTB4) and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (12(R)-HETE and 12(R)-HETrE) (6.Laniado Schwartzman M. Green K. Edelhauser H.F. Hackett R.B. Hull D.S. Potter D.E. Tripathi R.C. Advances in Ocular Toxicology. Plenum Press, New York1997: 3-20Crossref Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that 12(R)-HETE and 12(R)-HETrE possess potent inflammatory properties with 12(R)-HETrE being a powerful angiogenic factor and that both metabolites assume the role of inflammatory mediators in hypoxia- and alkali-induced injury in the cornea, in vivo (7.Conners M.S.

Dunn M.W. Laniado Schwartzman M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 1963-1971PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies using in vitro models of corneal epithelial injury further support a relationship between injury, hypoxia, and the production of the CYP-derived eicosanoids (9.Vafeas C. Mieyal P.A. Urbano F. Falck J.R. Chauhan K. Berman M. Laniado Schwartzman M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 903-910PubMed Google Scholar). Studies to identify the CYP isoform responsible for the production of 12(R)-HETE and 12(R)-HETrE revealed that a CYP4B1 isoform is readily induced in response to hypoxia in vitroand in vivo and that antibodies against this isoform inhibited the synthesis of these eicosanoids (10.Mastyugin V. Aversa E. Vafeas C. Mieyal P. Laniado Schwartzman M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 1611-1619PubMed Google Scholar). Hypoxia and cellular injury provoke the induction of COX-2 in many cell types (11.Schmedtje Jr., J.F. Ji Y.-S. Liu W.-L. DuBois R.N. Runge M.S. J Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 601-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 12.Chida M. Voelkel N.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L872-L878PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, induction of COX-2 mRNA and protein together with increasing levels of prostanoids, mainly PGE2, is the hallmark of inflammation in many tissues (13.DuBois R.N. Abramson S.B. Crofford L. Gupta R.A. Simon L.S. Van De Putte L.B. Lipsky P.E. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar,14.Vane J.R. Bakhle Y.S. Botting R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar). Among the factors associated with the transcriptional activation of COX-2 are the PPARs. These are nuclear hormone receptors that regulate gene transcription in response to peroxisome proliferators and fatty acids, including certain PGs, HETEs, as well as some of the commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (15.Willson T.M. Wahli W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 16.Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar). PPAR ligands activate transcription of COX-2 as well as the transcription of several CYP4 genes, including CYP4B1 (17.Meade E.A. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8328-8334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 18.Claire A.E. Simpson M. Gen.

Hence, we carried out studies to determine the involvement of COX-2 in hypoxia-induced injury of the corneal epithelium and to examine its relation to PPAR activation and CYP4B1 expression. The RCE cell line was obtained from Dr. Kaoru Arakai-Sasake (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) (20.Araki K. Ohashi Y. Kinoshita S. Hayashi K. Yang X.Z. Hosaka Y. Aizawa S. Handa H. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 2665-2671PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence in Petri dishes (60 mm) using medium containing a mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (Fungizone, Life Technologies, Inc.); 48 h before the experiment, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 0.4% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were then washed twice with 2 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 2 ml of serum-free medium containing antibiotics with and without PPAR ligands or COX inhibitors under normoxia (5% CO2, 95% air (∼20% O2)) or in a modular tissue culture chamber (Billups-Rothenburg, Del Mar, CA) supplied continuously with 5% CO2, 0% O2, 95% N2 (hypoxia) and bubbled through deionized H2O into the chamber within a 37 °C incubator for an additional 2–24 h. In some experiments, cells were incubated withl-buthionine-[S,R]sulfoximine (BSO, 1 mm) and maleic acid diethylester (DEM, 1 mm) for 18 h to deplete intracellular GSH. Protein content was determined using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Cell lysates (30 μg of protein) were mixed with Laemmli reagent (final concentration 1%, w/v, sodium dodecyl sulfate; 10%, v/v, glycerol; 0.5%, w/v, bromphenol blue) under reducing conditions (4%, v/v, β-mercaptoethanol) and heated for 5 min at 85 °C. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using 10% (w/v) and 3% (w/v) acrylamide for separating gel and stacking gel, respectively. Protein transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed at 16 V for 1 h. Membranes were saturated in blocking buffer containing 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the following polyclonal antibody preparations: rabbit anti-murine COX-2, goat anti-human COX-1, rabbit anti-human HO-1, or rabbit anti-human HO-2. After washing with buffer (Tris/HCl, 0.42%, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Tween 20), membranes were further incubated with an anti-rabbit or anti-goat IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at dilution 1:4,000 for 45 min at room temperature. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using chemiluminescence substrates according to the manufacturer's instructions and were visualized after exposure to HyperfilmTM ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantitation was performed by scanning the blot into Photoshop and performing densitometry with NIH Image. At the end of the incubation period, the medium was collected and stored at −80 °C. Solid phase enzyme immunoassay (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) was performed as suggested by the manufacturer. PGE2 levels were determined using a standard curve and a linear log-logit transformation. Cells were incubated under normoxia or hypoxia or treated with WY-14,643 (100 μm) for 12 and 24 h in a serum-free medium. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and further incubated with arachidonic acid (10 μm) in the presence or absence of heme (2 μm), NS398 (1 μm), indomethacin (5 μm), or GSH (10–50 mm) for 1 h in an oxygenated incubator. PGE2 levels in the medium were measured by enzyme immunoassay as described above. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and quantified spectrophotometerically. RT reaction was performed with 5 μg of total RNA and an oligo(dT) primer using the First-Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For amplification of 28 S rRNA and PPARs (α, β, γ), a specific backward primer was used in the single reaction. The reaction mixture was then subjected to brief incubation at 65 °C in order to inactivate the enzyme. PCR reactions were carried out in a final volume of 100 μl consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 2 mm MgSO4, 200 μm amounts of each deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, 4 μl of the RT first-strand cDNA product, 0.2 μm of each forward and reverse primer, and 2.5 units of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The reactions were heated to 97 °C for 1 min and then immediately cycled 30 or 35 times through a 1-min denaturing step, 1.5-min annealing step at 50 or 55 °C, and a 2-min extension step at 72 °C. After the cycling procedure, a final 10-min elongation step at 72 °C was performed. The following primers were used: CYP4B1 primers, 4B1-F (5′-TCTCTGGGTTGGACAGTTCATTG) and 4B1-R (5′-TGTCTCCTTTGCCAAACGTACAC); COX-2 primers, COX-2F (5′-GCCCTTCCTCCTGTGGCTGAT) and COX-2R (5′-TTGAGCACATCGCACACTCT); 28 S rRNA primers, 28 S rRNA-F (5′-AAACTCTGGTGGAGGTCCGT) and 28 S rRNA-R (5′-CTTACCAAAAGTGGCCCACTA). Primers for the different PPARs were designed as described previously (21.Guan Y. Zhang Y. Davis L. Breyer M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F1013-F1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA (10 μg) was separated on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and transferred overnight to Hybond N plus membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) through capillary blotting. The membranes were probed with 32P-labeled cDNA probes in Rapid-Hyb hybridization buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The rabbit COX-2 cDNA probe was obtained from Dr. M. Breyer, Vanderbilt University (22.Chang M.S. Tsai J.C. Yang R. DuBois R.N. Breyer M.D. O'Day D.M. Curr. Eye Res. 1997; 16: 1147-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The rabbit 28 S rRNA probe was generated by PCR as described above. The resulting blots were subjected to autoradiography with NEF reflection autoradiography films (NEN Life Science Products). Densitometry analysis was done as described for the Western blot. Analysis of variance and Student'st test for unpaired data were used to evaluate differences among control and treated samples. A p value less than or equal to 0.05 was considered significant. Unless stated otherwise, results are presented as means ± S.E. COX-2 is induced in many cell types in response to injury, growth factors and cytokines. In this respect, RCE cells exhibit a similar response; COX-2 protein levels are markedly increased by 2–3-fold in response to these stimuli (data not shown). Hypoxic injury is considered an inflammatory stimulus in many tissues. In RCE cells, hypoxia, caused a 3-fold increase in COX-2 protein levels within 24 h (Fig. 1 A). The effect of hypoxia on COX-2 protein was time-dependent and correlated with the increasing levels of COX-2 mRNA (Fig.1 B). CYP4B1, a cytochrome P450 protein whose expression has been correlated with the synthesis of the inflammatory eicosanoids 12(R)-HETE and 12(R)-HETrE by the corneal epithelium (10.Mastyugin V. Aversa E. Vafeas C. Mieyal P. Laniado Schwartzman M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 1611-1619PubMed Google Scholar), showed a similar time course of expression in response to hypoxia (data not shown). The transcriptional activation of COX-2 and CYP4B1 following hypoxia may share a common mechanism; both have been shown to be activated by PPAR ligands. As seen in Fig.2 A, RT-PCR of RCE cell mRNA revealed the presence of PPARα and PPARβ transcripts but no transcript for PPARγ. Control experiments indicated that the expression of PPARs α, β, and γ was readily detected in rabbit liver RNA (Fig. 2 B). The specificity of these PCR products (corneal epithelial PPAR α and β) was further demonstrated by restriction analysis based on the published sequences of the rabbit PPARs (21.Guan Y. Zhang Y. Davis L. Breyer M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F1013-F1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We further examined the effect of common peroxisome proliferators as well as NSAIDs that have been shown to act as PPAR ligands (23.Lehmann J.M. Lenhard J.M. Oliver B.B. Ringold G.M. Kliewer S.A. J Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3406-3410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar) on COX protein levels. As seen in Fig.3 A, the commonly used PPAR ligand, WY-14,643, greatly increased COX-2 protein levels. WY-14,643 was more potent than clofibrate; its addition to the medium caused a 2-fold increase in COX-2 protein (Fig. 3 A), while clofibrate increased COX-2 protein by about 30% (data not shown). Under hypoxic conditions, addition of WY-14,643 did not produce an additional significant increase in COX-2 levels (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that hypoxia and the PPAR ligand may share a common mechanism for induction of COX-2. Indomethacin as well as flurbiprofen significantly increased COX-2 protein levels by about 2-fold. Aspirin at a concentration of 100 μm also increased COX-2 protein levels (data not shown). Similar to WY-14,643, addition of these NSAIDs to hypoxia-treated cells did not cause a further increase in COX-2 protein levels (data not shown). Neither hypoxia nor WY-14,643 or NSAIDs changed the level of the constitutively expressed COX-1 protein (Fig. 3 A). Actinomycin D inhibited COX-2 expression when used in combination with hypoxia, indomethacin, and WY-14,643 (Fig.3 B), further indicating that COX-2 is transcriptionally activated under these conditions. Indeed, Northern analysis demonstrated that addition of WY-14,643 resulted in a 2-fold increase in COX-2 mRNA (Fig. 4). Indomethacin at 30 μm, while increasing COX-2 protein levels (Fig.3 A) and COX-2 mRNA (data not shown), inhibited PGE2 levels by 60% and 80% in cells grown under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, respectively. The effect of indomethacin on COX-2 protein levels was not reversed by addition of exogenous PGE2. In fact, addition of exogenous PGE2 to normoxia- and indomethacin-treated cells had little or no effect on COX-2 protein levels (Fig. 5), suggesting a dissociation between COX-2 expression and PGE2 levels. Similar results were obtained in hypoxia/indomethacin-treated cells (data not shown).Figure 4Effect of WY-14,643 on COX-2 mRNA in RCE cells. Quiescent cells were incubated under normoxic conditions in the presence or absence of WY-14,643 for 8, 12, and 24 h. Northern blot analysis of total RNA was performed using the rabbit COX-2 cDNA and 28 S rRNA probes.

Quiescent cells were incubated under normoxia in the presence and absence of PGE2 (1 μm) and indomethacin (30 μm) for 12 h. At the end of the incubation period, cells were harvested and COX-2 protein levels determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are the mean ± S.E., n= 3, *p < 0.05 from control normoxia.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The increase in COX-2 protein levels in response to hypoxia or WY-14,643 was not associated with a comparable increase in PGE2 levels (Fig.6 A). In fact, marked 65% and 64% decreases in PGE2 levels were observed in cells grown under hypoxic conditions for 12 and 24 h, respectively. In WY-14,643-treated cells for 12 h PGE2 levels were similar to the control levels; however, at 24 h the levels were significantly reduced by 25% as compared with control cells (Fig.6 A). Cells grown under hypoxic conditions and treated with WY-14,643 showed a similar decrease in PGE2 levels to that in hypoxia, namely 701 ± 53, 448 ± 63, and 438 ± 61 pg PGE2/ml in normoxia, hypoxia, and hypoxia+WY-14,643, respectively. These results are similar to that obtained for the protein where no additive effect for hypoxia and WY-14,643 was observed (Fig. 3 A). There are several possibilities that could account for the decreased PGE2 levels. One is a lack of substrate, arachidonic acid, which has been long considered as the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin synthesis. Addition of 10 μm arachidonic acid to hypoxia or WY-14,643-treated cells during the culture period restored the levels of PGE2accumulation to that seen in cells incubated under normoxic conditions (Fig. 6 B). However, the increase in PGE2 levels in cells supplemented with arachidonic acid did not reflect the 2–4-fold increase in COX-2 protein seen in cells incubated under the same conditions (Figs. 1 and 3). Another possibility is that the induced COX-2 protein is defective or is inactive due to a lack of cofactors such as heme. In many cells, the level of heme is regulated by the activity of heme oxygenase (HO), specifically the inducible isoform, HO-1. Western blot analysis revealed that only hypoxic conditions caused a marked increase in HO-1 protein levels (Fig. 7). WY-14,643 and indomethacin, while increasing COX-2 protein, had no effect on HO-1 protein level. In all experimental conditions, the protein levels of the constitutively expressed isoform, HO-2, remained unchanged (Fig.7). These results suggest that, at least in hypoxia, a shortage of cellular heme may contribute to the decrease in PGE2levels. The reduced PGE2 levels in hypoxia-treated cells may also stem from lack of oxygen. However, neither heme nor oxygen can account for the relatively depressed PGE2 in WY-14,643-treated cells. It is well documented that the catalytic activity of COX isoforms requires the presence of hydroperoxides (24.Kulmacz R.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). On the other hand, conditions of oxidative stress such as those associated with hypoxia and inflammatory processes are associated with increased expression of GSH-dependent peroxidase (25.Mates J.M. Sanchez-Jimenez F. Frontiers Biosci. 1999; 4: D339-D345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glutathione peroxidase as well as GSH itself have been shown to inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 catalytic activity (26.Capdevila J.H. Morrow J.D. Belosludtsev Y.Y. Beauchamp D.R. DuBois R.N. Falck J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3325-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether changes in GSH levels underlie the decrease in PGE2 levels, cells were incubated with BSO and DEM to deplete endogenous GSH under hypoxia and with the addition of WY-14,643. As seen in Fig. 8, depletion of GSH increased PGE2 levels by 8-, 2- and 14-fold in normoxia-, hypoxia-, and WY-14,643-treated cells, respectively. Moreover, PGE2 accumulation in WY-14,643-treated cells was well correlated with the increased COX-2 protein expression. In contrast, measurement of COX activity as the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGE2 in 1 h in the presence of exogenous GSH demonstrated a concentration-dependent inhibition of COX activity (30% and 40% inhibition at 10 and 50 mm GSH, respectively). We further examined COX activity in cells grown for 12 or 24 h in hypoxia or normoxia and in cells treated with WY-14,643 and subsequently incubated under normoxia with 10 μmarachidonic acid and 2 μm heme for 1 h. As seen in Fig. 9, in 12- and 24-h hypoxia-treated cells COX activity was 2 and 5 times higher than that of the control cells, respectively, further indicating that the increased immunoreactive COX-2 protein is an active enzyme and that oxygen is a major limiting factor. However, COX activity in cells treated with WY-14,643 remained low and was about 50% of the activity measured in control cells (Fig. 9). Finally, addition of the selective COX-2 inhibitor, NS398, to the incubation medium revealed that about 50% of the COX activity in cells incubated under normoxic condition is driven by COX-2, while in hypoxia-treated cells or cells treated with WY-14,643, this activity accounts for almost 100% (Fig.10) suggesting that, although COX-1 protein level remains unchanged, its activity was diminished following hypoxia and WY-14643 treatment.Figure 10Effect of NS-398 and indomethacin on COX activity. RCE cells were grown for 24 h under normoxic or hypoxic conditions or treated with WY-14,643 (100 μm), washed twice, and incubated under normoxia with arachidonic acid (10 μm) and heme (2 μm) in the presence and absence of indomethacin (5 μm) or NS-398 (1 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples of the medium were collected and PGE2 levels measured. Results are the mean ± S.E., n = 4; *, p < 0.05 from normoxia indomethacin-treated cells; †,p < 0.05 from normoxia NS-398-treated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Early prostaglandin research strove to establish a link between their synthesis and ocular inflammation. It is well documented that corneal surface injury increases production of cyclooxygenase-derived eicosanoids (PGI2, PGF2α, PGE2, PGD2, and thromboxane A2) by the corneal epithelium (27.Bazan H.E.P. Birkle D.L. Beuerman R.W. Bazan N.G. Curr. Eye Res. 1985; 4: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). There are, however, several observations that challenge the significance of their role in the inflammatory response. The increase in the production of these eicosanoids correlates poorly to the inflammatory sequelae (28.Gluud B.S. Jensen O.L. Krogh E. Birgens H.S. Acta Ophthalmol. 1985; 63: 375-379Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Moreover, while topical applications of micromolar concentrations of these eicosanoids are required to elicit inflammatory effects, much lower concentrations are usually recovered at the site of surface injury (29.Napoli S.A. Helm C. Insler M.S. Ensley H.E. Pretus H.A. Feigen L.P. Ann. Ophthalmol. 1990; 22: 30-34PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Srinivasan B.D. Kulkarni P.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1980; 19: 1087-1093PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the use of metabolic inhibitors against the cyclooxygenase pathway is not as efficacious as corticosteroids in the treatment of ocular surface inflammation (31.Srinivasan B.D. Kulkarni P.S. Bito L.Z. Stjernschantz J. The Ocular Effect of Prostaglandins and Other Eicosanoids. Alan R. Liss, New York1989: 229-249Google Scholar, 32.Haynes W.L. Proia A.D. Klintworth G.K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1989; 30: 1588-1593PubMed Google Scholar). These inhibitors tend to have partial efficacy at best, indicating that other corticosteroid-sensitive mediators may participate in the corneal inflammatory response. Studies in our laboratory identified the formation of the CYP-derived arachidonic acid metabolites 12(R)-HETE, a Na,K-ATPase inhibitor with chemotactic activity, and 12(R)-HETrE, a powerful proinflammatory mediator that has been shown to stimulate vasodilation, increase anterior chamber proteins, chemoattract polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and elicit angiogenesis (see Ref. 6.Laniado Schwartzman M. Green K. Edelhauser H.F. Hackett R.B. Hull D.S. Potter D.E. Tripathi R.C. Advances in Ocular Toxicology. Plenum Press, New York1997: 3-20Crossref Google Scholar and references therein). The endogenous conversion of arachidonate to these metabolites is increased following hypoxia in vitro andin vivo and after chemical injury in vivo. Their production rate correlates with the inflammatory response in vivo and inhibition of their formation attenuates the inflammation (reviewed in Ref. 6.Laniado Schwartzman M. Green K. Edelhauser H.F. Hackett R.B. Hull D.S. Potter D.E. Tripathi R.C. Advances in Ocular Toxicology. Plenum Press, New York1997: 3-20Crossref Google Scholar). In all, these studies clearly place the CYP-derived 12-hydroxyeicosanoids as corneal epithelial-derived mediators of ocular surface inflammation. However, the discovery of COX-2 as the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase that is differently affected by common NSAIDs brought back the question of the involvement of prostaglandins in the ocular inflammatory process. The contemporary view is that prostaglandins are mediators of numerous biological processes including inflammation (33.Bazan N.G. Allan G. Surv. Ophthalmol. 1997; 41 Suppl. 2: S23-S34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we examined the presence and inducibility of COX-2 in corneal epithelial cells following hypoxia-induced injury; such injury has been associated with a severe inflammatory response in vivo and with increased production of 12-HETE and 12-HETrEin vivo and in vitro (7.Conners M.S.

We found that COX-2, but not COX-1, mRNA and protein levels are markedly increased in RCE cells following hypoxia. Hypoxia has been shown to stimulate the expression of COX-2 in the lung and endothelial cells (11.Schmedtje Jr., J.F. Ji Y.-S. Liu W.-L. DuBois R.N. Runge M.S. J Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 601-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 12.Chida M. Voelkel N.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L872-L878PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Ji Y.S. Xu Q. Schmedtje Jr., J.F. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). While acute exposure (2 h) to hypoxia increased COX activity in endothelial cells (35.Michiels C. Arnould T. Knott I. Dieu M. Remacle J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C866-C874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), chronic exposure (24 h) in these cells and in alveolar macrophages resulted in decreased COX-2 protein and PGE2 synthesis (36.Farber H.W. Barnett H.F. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 1446-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 37.Hempel S.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In our study, 12–24 h of hypoxia markedly decreased PGE2 accumulation while increasing COX-2 expression. The use of the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 further suggested that COX activity in hypoxic cells is essentially that of COX-2, whereas in control (normoxia) cells, both COX-1 and COX-2 contributed equally to the production of PGE2. Recent studies demonstrated that a CYP4B1 isoform is induced in the corneal epithelium in response to hypoxia and is involved in the production of 12-HETE and 12-HETrE (10.Mastyugin V. Aversa E. Vafeas C. Mieyal P. Laniado Schwartzman M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 1611-1619PubMed Google Scholar). A similar pattern of induction was observed in RCE cells. The increased CYP4B1 and COX-2 mRNA levels suggest a common mechanisms for regulation. Indeed, the rabbit lung CYP4B1 has been shown to be activated by clofibrate, a PPAR activator (15.Willson T.M. Wahli W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Likewise, COX-2 expression has been shown to be induced by numerous PPAR ligands (17.Meade E.A. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8328-8334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Moreover, clofibrate increased conversion of arachidonic acid to 12-HETE and 12-HETrE in the corneal epithelium (10.Mastyugin V. Aversa E. Vafeas C. Mieyal P. Laniado Schwartzman M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 1611-1619PubMed Google Scholar). These findings indicate the possibility that PPAR activation may underlie the increased expression of COX-2 and CYP4B1 in hypoxia-treated cells. RT-PCR analysis clearly detected signals for PPARα and PPARβ, but not PPARγ, in hypoxia-treated cells. Treatment of cells with WY-14,643, a selective PPARα and β activator, markedly increased COX-2 expression. Furthermore, NSAIDs known to act as peroxisome proliferators such as indomethacin, flurbiprofen, and aspirin (23.Lehmann J.M. Lenhard J.M. Oliver B.B. Ringold G.M. Kliewer S.A. J Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3406-3410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar) also increased COX-2 protein and mRNA. Interestingly, several NSAIDs have been shown to inhibit NFκB activation (38.Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar); the latter may be an important transcriptional activator of COX-2 expression in response to hypoxia (11.Schmedtje Jr., J.F. Ji Y.-S. Liu W.-L. DuBois R.N. Runge M.S. J Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 601-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The observation that these NSAIDs did not decrease COX-2 expression under hypoxic conditions argues against a dependence on NFκB in the hypoxia-induced expression of COX-2. In all, these findings suggest the possibility that PPAR activation, at least in part, contributes to the hypoxia-induced expression of COX-2 and CYP4B1. To this end, addition of PPAR ligands to hypoxia-treated cells did not yield a further increase in either COX-2 protein, mRNA, or PGE2accumulation, suggesting that hypoxia and PPAR ligands may share a similar mechanism, e.g. PPAR activation, by which they transcriptionally activate COX-2 expression. Noteworthy is the fact that the increased expression of COX-2 after addition of a PPAR ligand was, as in hypoxia, associated with a decrease in PGE2 accumulation. However, while COX enzymatic activity in hypoxic cells could be fully expressed, when oxygen is replenished, to reflect the 3–4-fold increase in protein levels, it was just about 50% of control in cells treated with WY-14,643. Ledwithet al. (39.Ledwith B.J. Pauley C.J. Wagner L.K. Rokos C.L. Alberts D.W. Manam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3707-3714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) have shown that PPAR ligands, including WY-14643, cause little or no increase in PGE2 levels in mouse liver cells, while markedly increasing COX-2 expression. These authors demonstrated that PPAR ligands do not inhibit COX enzymatic activity and suggested that these agents exhibit an indirect inhibitory effect on COX activity. Our findings concur with this report; however, they also offer a potential mechanism for WY-14,643. As indicated before, GSH peroxidase exerts a regulatory control on COX activity (26.Capdevila J.H. Morrow J.D. Belosludtsev Y.Y. Beauchamp D.R. DuBois R.N. Falck J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3325-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Depletion of GSH in cells treated with WY-14,643 restored COX activity and increased it to levels that better reflected the increase in protein expression induced by WY-14,643. It is possible that the indirect inhibitory activity of WY-14,643 referred to in the study of Ledwith et al. (39.Ledwith B.J. Pauley C.J. Wagner L.K. Rokos C.L. Alberts D.W. Manam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3707-3714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) is an effect on GSH metabolism leading to increased GSH levels that have been shown in our study as well as others to inhibit COX activity. Indeed, there are numerous reports demonstrating the effect of peroxisome proliferators including WY-14,643 on GSH metabolism (40.Cai Y. Appelkvist E.L. DePierre J.W. J. Biochem. Toxicol. 1995; 10: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The dissociation between COX-2 expression and PGE2 levels in cells that were subjected to hypoxia could be the result of several factors operating under these conditions. One such factor is the availability of the substrate, arachidonic acid. However, experiments in which cells were prelabeled with arachidonic acid indicate that the levels of free arachidonic acid are, in fact, increased during hypoxia (data not shown). This is in accordance with reports which demonstrated that in many tissues ischemia/hypoxia leads to increased fatty acid release, including arachidonic acid, subsequent to activation of phospholipase A2 (41.Mukherjee A.B. Miele L. Pattabiraman N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). One may argue that, when COX is inhibited, such increases may be shifted to other metabolic enzymes such as lipoxygenases and CYP monooxygenase. However, these cells do not express significant levels of either lipoxygenase or cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activity in culture under normoxia or hypoxia (data not shown). The small increase in PGE2 accumulation may be due to the fact that the addition of exogenous arachidonic acid resulted in increased hydroperoxide levels, an essential requirement for COX catalytic activity (42.Marshall P.J. Kulmacz R.J. Lands W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3510-3517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are several reports indicating the presence of hydroperoxides with various preparations of arachidonic acid (43.Allen K.G. Huang C.J. Morin C.L. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that PGE2 levels in hypoxia-treated cells were essentially the same when either arachidonic acid was added or GSH was depleted. This suggests that the increased hydroperoxide level rather than substrate is the major factor contributing to the increased PGE2 levels. With regard to hypoxia, factors such as lack of oxygen and increasing heme degradation due to rapid induction of HO-1 (44.Lee P.J. Jiang B.-H. Chin B.Y. Iyer N.V. Alam J. Semenza G.L. Choi A.M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5375-5381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) are likely to be the major factors in limiting COX activity. Indeed, reoxygenation in the presence of heme restored COX activity in hypoxia-treated cells. On the other hand, the WY-14,643 inhibitory effect on COX activity was not removed by reoxygenation and heme. The apparent disparity between expression of COX-2 and endogenous levels of PGE2 in the injured cells may have important pathophysiological and therapeutic implications. It is well documented that prolonged exposure of the corneal epithelium to hypoxia in the form of eye closure or contact lens wear leads to a pronounced inflammatory response (7.Conners M.S. Stoltz R.A. Webb S.C. Rosenberg J. Dunn M.W. Abraham N.G. Schwartzman M.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 828-840PubMed Google Scholar). It is also known that NSAIDs are only partially effective in treating ocular surface inflammation. Inasmuch as COX-2 is defined as an inflammatory gene, in the context of this type of injury and this tissue, it seems likely that its rapid induction does not lead to increased levels of PGE2,i.e. an increase in its expression does not yield a parallel increase in PGE2, further indicating that the inflammatory response in the corneal epithelium is not prostanoid-mediated under these conditions. Moreover, under these conditions, NSAIDs may intensify the inflammatory response by activating PPARs and subsequently amplifying the response via induction of CYP4B1 and production of the proinflammatory eicosanoids, 12-HETE and 12-HETrE. The increased production of the latter in the presence of NSAIDs may also result from shunting arachidonic acid to this pathway. To this end, preliminary studies have demonstrated induction of PPARs α and β, COX-2, and CYP4B1 expression in corneal epithelium from rabbit eyes that were subjected to hypoxia via eye closure and contact lens wear; in this model the inflammatory response including edema, vasodilation, and neovascularization correlates with the duration of contact lens wear and is associated with increased synthesis of 12-HETE and 12-HETrE. The events demonstrated in the cultured corneal epithelial cells may also occur in vivo not only in the cornea but also in other tissues where hypoxia produces an inflammatory response such as in vascular occlusion diseases. Moreover, the results of this study suggest that the therapeutic action of peroxisome proliferators such as fibrates may involve an increase in GSH levels and a decrease in the level of peroxidation. Similarly, NSAIDs may act in such a way by activating PPARs and thus indirectly promoting antioxidant mechanisms.

The molecular mechanism by which selenium exerts its action on the cellular events, however, remains unclear. In our present study, we observed that selenite suppresses both the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in 293T cells. In contrast, selenite had little effect on the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. Furthermore, selenite directly inhibited JNK/SAPK activity in vitro but not the p38 activity. The in vitro inhibition of JNK/SAPK by selenite was reversed by the addition of reducing agents such as dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol. Replacement of cysteine 116 in JNK1 by serine abolished the inhibitory effect of selenite on JNK1 activity both in vitro and in vivo. Selenite also suppressed a c-Jun-dependent luciferase reporter activity stimulated through the JNK signaling pathway. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that selenite differentially modulates the mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and that it can repress the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway by inhibiting JNK/SAPK through a thiol redox mechanism.

For instance, selenite and other selenium compounds have been shown to inhibit the functions of Na-K-ATPase, rat brain prostaglandin D synthase, a glucocorticoid receptor, nuclear factor κB, and the transcription factor AP-1 by reacting with critical sulfhydryl groups of the proteins (8.Handel M.L.

Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Such proteins include glutathione peroxidases, formate dehydrogenases, glycine reductases, and the 5′-deiodinases (16.Stadman T.C. Annu. Rev.

Nonetheless, the modulatory functions of selenite and other selenium compounds on intracellular signaling pathways are not fully understood. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 pathway is one of the most widely studied signaling pathways involved in the transduction of intracellular signals initiated by extracellular stimuli to the nucleus. MAPKs are serine/threonine protein kinases that play pivotal roles in a variety of cell activities, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, developments, and survival, in many cell types (18.Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3175) Google Scholar). The MAPKs have been subdivided into three subfamilies: ERK, JNK/SAPK, and p38 MAPK (19.Davis R.J. Trends Biochem.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3175) Google Scholar, 25.Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4213) Google Scholar). The ERK pathway consists of ERK, upstream kinases that include mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase, and Raf-1 (18.Seger R. Krebs E.G.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible effects of selenite on mammalian MAPK pathways. We found that selenite exerts distinct effects on the ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Selenite inhibits the JNK and p38 signaling pathways but not the ERK signaling pathway. Moreover, this study suggests that selenite suppresses JNK activity by a thiol redox mechanism. Differential regulation of the MAPK pathways by selenite may be important to understand the mechanism by which selenite can modulate the intracellular signaling cascades and, thus, exert its effects on various cellular events. 293T human embryonic kidney cells were routinely maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For DNA transfections, cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at a density of 2 × 106 cells/plate, grown overnight, and then tranfected with appropriate expression vectors using calcium phosphate (38.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). After 48 h of transfection, the cells were treated with indicated agents and harvested for further experiments. When indicated, cells in culture were irradiated with 80 J/m2 ultraviolet light for 1 h at 37 °C. Confluent cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer A containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 mmglycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. Cell lysates were then subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. A soluble fraction was incubated with appropriate antibodies against the indicated protein kinases for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were then coupled to protein G-agarose during incubation for an additional 1 h at 4 °C, after which they were pelleted by centrifugation. The immunopellets were rinsed three times with buffer A and then twice with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Immunocomplex kinase assays were performed by incubating the immunopellets for 30 min at 30 °C with 2 μg of substrate proteins in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of 5× Laemmli's sample buffer and heating at 80 °C for 3 min. Phosphorylated substrates were then visualized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified using a Fuji BAS 2500 phosphorimager. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins used as substrates were expressed in Escherichia coli using pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified on glutathione-Sepharose as described previously (39.Shim J. Lee H. Park J. Kim H. Choi E.-J. Nature. 1996; 381: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The antibodies used in the JNK1, p38, ERK2, and MEKK1 assays were as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-JNK1 (PharMingen), rabbit polyclonal anti-p38 (PharMingen), rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and rabbit polyclonal anti-MEKK1 (PharMingen) antibodies, respectively. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). 293T cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector, pEBG, producing GST-SEK1 (27.Sánchez I Hughes R.T.

Transfected cells were harvested and homogenized in phosphate-buffered solution containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 7 μg/ml aprotinin. Cell lysates were clarified by microcentrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min and solubilized with 1% Triton X-100. The soluble fraction was then applied to glutathione-Sepharose resin. GST fusion proteins eluted from the resin were assayed for SEK1 activity by incubation with 2 μg of recombinant GST-SAPKβ in 20 μl of the reaction buffer, as described above for the immunocomplex kinase assay. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following mutagenic primers were used: C79S, 5′-CAGAGAGCTAGTTCTTATGAAATcTGTTAATCACAAAAAT-3′; C116S, 5′-GGATGCAAATCTTTcCCAAGTGATTCAGATGG-3′; and C137S, 5′-CTATCAGATGCTGTcTGGAATCAAGCACC-3′. Mismatches with the wild-type JNK1 template are indicated by lowercase letters. The mutation was verified by automatic DNA sequencing. Transcriptional activity of c-Jun was determined using the PathDetect luciferase reporter kit (Stratagene). 293T cells were transiently transfected with pFR-Luc, pFA2-c-jun, pFC-MEKK, and pcDNA3-βgal by the calcium phosphate method. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were harvested, lysed, and subjected to microcentrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min. The soluble fraction was assayed for luciferase activity using a luciferase assay kit (Promega). The expression levels of the luciferase reporter protein in the transfected cells were normalized in reference to β-galactosidase activities in the same cells. To investigate a possible role of selenite in the regulation of intracellular signaling cascades, we examined whether selenite could modulate MAPK activation processes. In this study, we observed that exposure of 293T cells to 100 nm selenite resulted in suppression of the UV-stimulated activities of either JNK1 or p38 MAPK (Fig. 1), whereas it did not affect ERK2 activity. We then examined the effect of selenite on JNK1 and p38 MAPK after treating 293T cells with various concentrations of selenite. Selenite inhibited both the UV-stimulated JNK1 and p38 activities in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). The inhibitory effect of selenite on either JNK1 or p38 MAPK activity was also time-dependent (Fig. 2 B). Our findings thus suggest that selenite inhibits the two stress-regulated MAPK signals, the JNK and the p38 pathway, but not the ERK pathway. In the following experiments we investigated a possible mechanism of selenite suppression of the JNK signaling pathway.Figure 2Concentration and time dependence of the selenite effects on JNK1 and p38 activities in 293T cells. A, 293T cells were exposed to the indicated concentrations of sodium selenite for 48 h and then irradiated with UV light (80 J/m2) at 37 °C. B, 293T cells were exposed to 100 nm sodium selenite for the indicated time periods and then irradiated with UV light (80 J/m2) at 37 °C.A and B, after UV irradiation, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-JNK1 or anti-p38 antibody, respectively. Enzymatic activities of the immunoprecipitated JNK1 or p38 were then analyzed as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The JNK signaling cascade is composed of JNK and upstream kinases that include SEK1/JNK kinase 1/MKK4 and MEKK1 (23.Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). To delineate a mechanism for the inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway by selenite, we examined whether selenite could inhibit the enzymatic activities of SEK1 or MEKK1 in cells (Fig. 3). To test a possible effect of selenite on SEK1 activity, we transiently transfected 293T cells with an expression vector encoding GST-SEK1. Enzymatic activity of the ectopically expressed GST-SEK1 in transfected cells was stimulated by co-transfected ΔMEKK1, an active form of MEKK1. Exposure of the transfected cells to selenite even at 100 μm had little effect, if at all, on the ΔMEKK1-stimulated GST-SEK1 activity (Fig. 3 A). Selenite at 100 μm also had no effect on the UV-stimulated endogenous MEKK1 activity in cells (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were also observed when cells were exposed to 100 nm selenite for 48 h (data not shown). These findings, therefore, imply that selenite may repress the JNK pathway through direct action on JNK not through the upstream kinases such as MEKK1 or SEK1. To test whether selenite could directly act on and thus repress JNK1 activity, we examined the effect of selenite on JNK1 in vitro. Treatment of JNK1 immunocomplex with 100 nm selenite resulted in a complete suppression of the JNK1 activity (Fig.4 A). Our data indicated that nanomolar concentrations of selenite were sufficient to inhibit JNK activity in vitro (Fig. 4 B). In comparison, selenite at 100 μm did not affect the catalytic activity of either MEKK1 or SEK1 in vitro. Thus, JNK1 appears to be a primary target protein of selenite in the MEKK-SEK-JNK signaling cascade. Interestingly, selenite at 100 μm did not change enzymatic activity of p38 MAPK in vitro (Fig.4 A). These data suggest that selenite suppresses the JNK and p38 pathways by different mechanisms. There are many lines of evidence that selenite and other selenium compounds can modulate functions of target proteins by a redox mechanism (8.Handel M.L. Watts C.K.W. DeFazio A. Day R.O.

Biophys. 1991; 289: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism for the JNK1 inhibition by selenite could be oxidation of reactive sulfhydryl groups present on JNK1. We tested this hypothesis by using reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT) and β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) (Fig.5). In vitro inhibition of JNK1 by selenite was completely reversed by either 10 mmDTT or 10 mm β-ME (Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, JNK1 from selenite-treated cells was reactivated by DTT and β-ME (Fig.5 B). These findings suggest that selenite might suppress the JNK1 activity through a thiol redox mechanism and that the catalytic activity of JNK1 may require the reduced form of a critical sulfhydryl group(s) present in the enzyme. The importance of the sulfhydryl residue(s) in JNK activity is confirmed by the observation that JNK1 activity can be abolished by pretreatment with thiol-oxidizing agents such as N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), azodicarboxylic acid bis-dimethylamide (diamide), or o-iodosobenzoate (Fig.5 C). NEM is a modifier of thiols, and both diamide ando-iodosobenzoate can oxidize vicinal dithiols (41.Phelps D.C. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 42.Duhe R.J. Nielsen M.D. Dittman A.H. Villacres E.C. Choi E.-J. Storm D.R. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These thiol-modifying agents did not affect the p38 activity in vitro (data not shown). To further characterize the thiol redox regulation by selenite, we constructed the single mutants C79S, C116S, and C137S of JNK1, and examined the sensitivity of these JNK1 mutants to selenite. Cys79, Cys116, and Cys137 in JNK1 are the cysteine residues conserved among the JNK isoforms but not in ERKs or p38. We transiently transfected 293T cells with HA-tagged wild-type JNK1 or one of the single mutants and then examined the effect of selenite on enzymatic activities of the ectopically expressed JNK1 mutants (Fig. 6 A). Enzymatic activities of all of the three single mutants (C79S, C116S, and C137S) were stimulated in response of transfected cells to UV irradiation. Selenite inhibited the UV-stimulated enzymatic activity of wild-type JNK1, JNK1(C79S), or JNK1(C137S). Interestingly, JNK1(C116S) was resistant to both in vitro and in vivoinhibition by selenite (Fig. 6 A). The C116S mutant was also resistant to the inhibition by the thiol-oxidizing agents, NEM and diamide (Fig. 6 B). In comparison, the C79S and C137S mutants were sensitive to the inhibition by NEM and diamide. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that Cys116 is a critical cysteine residue of JNK1 for the thiol redox regulation. c-Jun is one of the major substrates of JNK, and the c-Jun phosphorylation by JNK results in stimulation of the transcriptional activity of c-Jun (19.Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined whether selenite could suppress the transcription-stimulating activity of c-Jun when this function of c-Jun was stimulated through the JNK pathway (Fig. 7). The transactivating activity of c-Jun was determined by measuring luciferase reporter gene expression. Whereas ΔMEKK1 induced the stimulation of c-Jun-mediated luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 7), exposure of cells to 100 nmselenite resulted in the inhibition of the ΔMEKK1-stimulated luciferase activity. In the present study, we demonstrate that selenite can inhibit the JNK and the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. A major mechanism by which selenite suppresses the JNK pathway appears to be the direct action of selenite on JNK itself, although the possibility that selenite could also act on any site(s) upstream of JNK can not be ruled out. Interestingly, in vitro inhibition of JNK by selenite can be reversed by reducing agents such as DTT or β-ME. These findings strongly suggest that a thiol redox mechanism may be involved in the inhibitory effect of selenite on JNK. Selenite and other selenium compounds have been shown previously to oxidize sulfhydryl groups present in proteins, resulting in the formation of selenotrisulfide (44.Gather H.E. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 45.Gather H.E. Corcoran C. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2557-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, selenite could possibly inhibit JNK activity through interacting with redox active cysteine residue(s) on the enzyme. The importance of reactive sulfhydryl residue(s) for JNK activity was confirmed by our data demonstrating that thiol-oxidizing agents such as NEM, diamide, or o-iodosobenzoate abolished the JNK1 activity in vitro. Furthermore, the site-directed cysteine mutant data in this study indicate that Cys116 is a critical cysteine residue of JNK1 for the inhibition by selenite and other thiol-oxidizing agents. JNK1 and p38 MAPK respond similarly to a variety of cellular stresses (23.Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, selenite did inhibit JNK1 activity, whereas it did not inhibit p38 activity in vitro. Furthermore, the thiol-oxidizing agents, which inhibited JNK1 activity, did not affect p38 activity (data not shown). At present, a mechanism by which selenite down-regulates the p38 signaling pathway has not yet been proposed. There could be some site(s) upsteam of p38 that could be potential target(s) for selenium. In this context, our in vitro kinase assay data suggest that neither MEKK1 nor SEK1/JNK kinase 1/MKK4 are targets for selenite. c-Jun is a component of the AP-1 complex, an important transcription factor involved in a variety of cellular events including cellular transformation (46.Holbrook N.J. Fornace A.J.J. New Biol. 1991; 3: 825-833PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Morgan J.I. Curran T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 421-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (2454) Google Scholar). It has been well documented that c-Jun is one of the major substrates for JNK, and c-Jun phosphorylation by JNK has been shown to result in higher transcription activation by c-Jun and to induce cellular transformation (20.Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar, 24.Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Interestingly, selenium compounds have been reported to inhibit AP-1 activity (8.Handel M.L. Watts C.K.W. DeFazio A. Day R.O. Sutherland R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4497-4501Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and cellular transformation (5.Borek C. Ong A. Mason H. Donahue L. Biaglow J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1490-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Our findings in this study, therefore, suggest that the inhibition of JNK by selenite may be one possible mechanism by which selenium inhibits cellular transformation as well as AP-1 activity. It has been also suggested that selenium inhibits AP-1 activity through interacting with vicinal thiols present within c-Jun (8.Handel M.L. Watts C.K.W. DeFazio A. Day R.O. Sutherland R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4497-4501Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 9.Spyrou G. Björnstedt M. Kumar S. Holmgren A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, selenium compounds seem to repress the transcription-stimulating activity of c-Jun in at least two different ways. Selenite and other selenium compounds modulate a variety of cellular processes such as cell proliferation, survival, and transformation (1.Greeder G.A. Milner J.A. Science. 1980; 209: 825-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 2.Milner J.A. Hsu C.Y. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 1652-1656PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Medina D. Lane H.W. Tracey C.M.

The mechanisms underlying the functions of selenite are not yet fully understood, however. In the present study, we demonstrate that selenite exerts its modulatory function on the stress-activated MAPK signaling pathways. The inhibitory effects of selenite on the JNK and the p38 kinase signaling pathway may be important components of a mechanism by which selenite modulates intracellular signaling cascades that mediate various cellular functions.

In addition to the negative regulatory roles of the SH2 and SH3 domains, they are also able to target Src kinases to their substrates (Fig. 1). In this model, binding of substrates by the SH2 and/or SH3 domains would target Hck to potential substrates and concomitantly activate the catalytic domain. Evidence that supports this model has been obtained for Src. Src associates with its substrates p130Cas and AFAP-110 via direct binding of the SH2 and SH3 domains of Src to ligand binding motifs in the substrates (20.Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y.

Biochem. 1997; 175: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These interactions appear to enhance the catalytic activity of Src; a peptide containing the SH2 and SH3 ligand motifs of Sin, a p130Cas-related Src substrate, activates c-Src (22.Alexandropoulos K. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1341-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). For Src, the sequences of the intramolecular ligands for the SH2 domain and SH3 domain do not conform to the highest affinity sequences as determined for the isolated domains (11.Nguyen J.T. Lim W.A.

The K d values for the pYEEI-containing peptide and the pYQPG-containing peptide are 0.2 μm and 29 μm, respectively (24.Bradshaw J.M. Grucza R.A. Ladbury J.E. Waksman G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9083-9090Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, the SH2 domain of Src displays a 150-fold higher affinity for the high affinity sequence, pYEEI, than for the tail sequence, pYQPG. Our premise is that the intramolecular SH2-binding site is lower in affinity so that exogenous ligands containing higher affinity sequences can compete for binding to the SH2 domain (11.Nguyen J.T. Lim W.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We mutated the C-terminal tail of Hck from YQQQ to YEEI to determine the effect of introducing a high affinity intramolecular ligand on enzyme regulation and substrate targeting. A recent crystal structure of YEEI-Hck in complex with the inhibitor PP1 is relevant to our mutant studies (Fig.2 A) (7.Schindler T. Sicheri F. Pico A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The relative orientation of SH3, SH2, and catalytic domains is unchanged from WT Hck (Fig. 2 A). Importantly, this is the first Hck structure to model the activation loop (residues 404–432) (7.Schindler T. Sicheri F. Pico A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The activation loop containing unphosphorylated Tyr416 is positioned such that access of peptide substrates to the catalytic machinery is blocked (Fig. 2 B) (7.Schindler T. Sicheri F. Pico A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously for Lck that the activation loop, when phosphorylated, is not in the active site (Fig.2 B) (25.Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). These data, together with the fact that autophosphorylation on Tyr416 in the activation loop is required for maximum activity (15.Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 26.Ferracini R. Brugge J. Oncogene Res. 1990; 5: 205-219PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Weijland A. Neubauer G.

In this model, autophosphorylation increases the catalytic activity of the enzyme by causing the activation loop to move out of the substrate-binding site, thereby allowing access to substrates. We mutated Tyr416 to alanine to investigate the relationship between autophosphorylation and kinase activity for Hck. We also used this mutant to investigate the relationship between autophosphorylation and down-regulation by intramolecular binding of SH2 and SH3 domains. The crystal structure of down-regulated Hck (7.Schindler T. Sicheri F. Pico A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) also suggests that the orientation of helix αC in the catalytic domain is a critical determinant of enzymatic activity. Before Hck is autophosphorylated, Glu310 on helix αC is pointed out of the active site. In crystal structures of active protein kinases such as Lck, helix αC is rotated relative to its position in Hck, and Glu310projects inward toward the ATP-binding site (7.Schindler T. Sicheri F. Pico A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 11.Nguyen J.T. Lim W.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). When Hck is activated by autophosphorylation, Glu310 forms an ion pair with Lys295 and positions this residue to coordinate the α and β phosphates of ATP (11.Nguyen J.T. Lim W.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To test the importance of this ion pair in Hck catalysis, we mutated Glu310 to alanine and measured the catalytic activity of the enzyme. C-terminally phosphorylated WT Hck and mutant forms of the enzyme were produced inSpodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells (5.Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 7.Schindler T. Sicheri F. Pico A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). His-tagged WT Hck, E310A Hck, and YEEI Hck were purified as described (7.Schindler T. Sicheri F. Pico A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), except that the final purification step for WT Hck was a γ-phosphate-linked ATP-Sepharose column (31.LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Pico A. Porter M. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32129-32134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). After the final column the protein was visualized as a single band by SDS-PAGE. The purification method for Y416A Hck was similar, but several minor modifications were made. Cells expressing His-tagged Y416A Hck were lysed in a French pressure cell in 50 ml of HiLoad Q buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 10% glycerol, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) containing protease inhibitors (5 mg/liter aprotinin, 5 mg/liter leupeptin, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), 0.1 mm vanadate, and 1 mm EDTA. Cell lysate was diluted to 200 ml, centrifuged, and filtered. The first step of purification was two 5-ml HiTrap SP columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in series with a HiLoad 26/10 Q-Sepharose High Performance (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The HiTrap SP columns were removed, and protein was eluted from the HiLoad Q column with a linear NaCl gradient. Fractions containing Hck were pooled, and NaCl and imidazole were added to match the column-loading buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 5% glycerol, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 m NaCl and 20 mmimidazole) for the 20 ml nickel nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (Qiagen). Hck was loaded onto the column, washed in buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 5% glycerol, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol), and eluted with a linear imidazole gradient. After pooling Hck-containing fractions, the His-tag was cleaved overnight on ice using a final concentration of 0.02 mg/ml His-tagged Tev protease. Complete cleavage of His tag was determined by SDS-PAGE. Buffer was exchanged with Mono Q buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) to remove imidazole. 2 ml of nickel nitrilotriacetic acid resin was added to 20 ml of sample and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rocking to remove His-tagged Tev protease. The unbound fraction and one wash (5 ml) were collected and loaded onto a Mono Q HR 5/5 column. Protein was eluted from the Mono Q column with a linear NaCl gradient. Fractions containing Hck were pooled and concentrated to 0.5 ml on an Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter unit (Millipore) and loaded on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 3 mm dithiothreitol. After the final column the protein was visualized as a single band by SDS-PAGE. The concentration of Y416A was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). For WT and each of the mutants, we confirmed that Tyr527was phosphorylated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analysis (5.Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). Treatment of the sample with Yersinia protein tyrosine phosphatase caused a loss of 80 molecular mass units from the tryptic fragment containing Tyr527, confirming its phosphorylation state. HIV-1 NL4–3 Nef protein was expressed as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coliNB42 cells. Cells were lysed in a French pressure cell in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (5 mg/liter aprotinin, 5 mg/liter leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysate was centrifuged and added to glutathione-agarose at 4 °C (Molecular Probes). The pellet was extracted with 1.5% N-lauroyl sarcosine, 25 mm triethanolamine, 100 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (5 mg/liter aprotinin, 5 mg/liter leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 30 min (32.Xu B. Bird V.G. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29825-29830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The sample was centrifuged, and the detergent-extracted supernatant was added to the glutathione beads. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed. Glutathione-agarose with immobilized GST-Nef was used directly in ligand binding experiments or treated with 20 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris, pH 8 to elute GST-Nef. The concentration of GST-Nef was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Peptides were prepared by solid phase synthesis on an Applied Biosystems automated 431A peptide synthesizer. The peptides were purified by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography and characterized by MALDI-TOF. The sequences of the peptides used are: substrate peptide for phosphocellulose assay, Arg-Arg-Leu-Ile-Glu-Asp-Ala-His-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Arg-Gly (31.LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Pico A. Porter M. Kuriyan J.

Stowell K.R. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15325-15328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); the control peptide for the pYEEI-containing substrate has the same sequence except Tyr(P) is substituted by Phe (34.Pellicena P. Stowell K.R. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15325-15328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Kinase assays were performed by two methods: (i) the phosphocellulose paper assay (35.Casnellie J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 36.Garcia P. Shoelson S.E. George S.T. Hinds D.A. Goldberg A.R. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25146-25151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (ii) a coupled spectrophotometric assay (29.Barker S.C. Kassel D.B. Weigl D. Huang X. Luther M.A. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14843-14851Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out at 30 °C. The phosphocellulose assay buffer contained 30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.84 mm peptide substrate, 0.5 mm ATP, and 100–500 cpm/pmol [γ-32P]ATP. The phosphocellulose assay reactions were terminated by the addition of 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged, and aliquots were spotted onto p81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman). The phosphocellulose paper was washed and counted in a scintillation counter to measure incorporation of 32P into peptide. E310A mutant and a WT control were assayed in duplicate both with and without preincubation (1 h, 4 °C, 1 μm enzyme, 200 μm ATP) in a final concentration of 80 nm enzyme. WT, YEEI mutant, and Y416A Hck were assayed by the spectrophotometric assay (29.Barker S.C. Kassel D.B. Weigl D. Huang X. Luther M.A. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14843-14851Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this assay, the production of ADP was coupled to the oxidation of NADH measured as a reduction in absorbance at 340 nm. Reactions were performed in 500 μl of buffer containing 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.28 mm NADH, 89 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 124 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase. When autophosphorylated Hck was required, 1–10 μm Hck was preincubated with 0.5 mm ATP for 30 min at room temperature (31.LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Pico A. Porter M. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32129-32134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Initial rates were measured, and kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the rates.K m was determined by fitting data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. K m values for ATP were determined using a range of ATP concentrations (20–500 μm) and 600 μm peptide substrate.K m values for peptide were determined using a range of peptide concentrations (75–2000 μm) and 250 μm ATP. The activation constant,K act, was determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the rates as a function of ligand concentration (Nef or pYEEI peptide) using the equation, va=Vact[L]/(Kact+[L])Equation 1 where v a = velocity measured in the presence of ligand minus the velocity measured in its absence,V act = the maximal activated velocity minus the velocity measured in the absence of ligand, and [L] is the concentration of either Nef or pYEEI peptide (38.Thomas J.W. Ellis B. Boerner R.J. Knight W.B. White G.C., II Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 577-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). TheK act values for WT and YEEI-Hck were determined using preincubated enzyme and varying concentrations of pYEEI (8–500 μm) or Nef (3–75 μm). AllK act determinations were performed in substrate concentrations of 500 μm ATP and 600 μmpeptide. To measure the time course of autophosphorylation, assays were done in 250 μm ATP and 600 μm peptide substrate, with no preincubation of enzyme with ATP. Mutagenesis was performed using the Stratagene QuikChange kit according to the manufacturer's directions. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Increasing amounts of WT Hck or YEEI Hck were added to GST-Nef immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mmNaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmsodium vanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in a final volume of 140 μl. After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed in same buffer. Hck bound to Nef was eluted in 50 μl of 5× Laemmli buffer and resolved using SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and detected with anti-c-Src rabbit polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and an enhanced chemiluminescent detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The association between the SH2 domain and the C-terminal tail has an inhibitory effect on the catalytic activity of WT Hck (15.Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). YEEI-Hck was designed to have a higher affinity association between the C-terminal tail and the SH2 domain. We first studied the kinetic properties of YEEI-Hck. YEEI-Hck is activated by autophosphorylation with similar kinetics to WT (TableI). Using autophosphorylated enzyme, we also determined that the ATP K m andV max were similar for WT and YEEI-Hck (Table I). Although dephosphorylation of Tyr527 in WT Hck is known to promote autophosphorylation (15.Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), engineering a stronger intramolecular SH2 interaction does not affect the kinetic properties of the catalytic domain.Table IKinetic parameters for WT Hck and YEEI-HckATPK mV maxpYEEI peptideK actNef K actLag time for autophosphorylationμmμmol min −1 mg −1μmμmminWT Hck97 ± 831 ± 331 ± 618 ± 317YEEI Hck106 ± 1131 ± 1>5009 ± 115Kinetic parameters were determined using the spectrophotometric assay. Enzymes were preincubated with ATP to allow autophosphorylation on Tyr416 prior to kinetic analysis except in the case of lag time measurements. Determinations of V max,K act, and K m were carried out at 10 nm enzyme. For determination of K mfor ATP, the peptide concentration was held constant at 600 μm. Lag time for autophosphorylation was determined at 50 nm enzyme. Open table in a new tab Kinetic parameters were determined using the spectrophotometric assay. Enzymes were preincubated with ATP to allow autophosphorylation on Tyr416 prior to kinetic analysis except in the case of lag time measurements. Determinations of V max,K act, and K m were carried out at 10 nm enzyme. For determination of K mfor ATP, the peptide concentration was held constant at 600 μm. Lag time for autophosphorylation was determined at 50 nm enzyme. We measured the accessibility of the SH2 domain of YEEI-Hck to exogenous ligands in two ways. First, we measuredK act, the concentration of ligand required to half-maximally activate the enzyme, for a synthetic phosphopeptide containing the high affinity SH2 binding sequence pYEEI. Autophosphorylated WT is activated by this peptide approximately 2-fold with a K act of 31 μm (Fig.3 A and Table I). In contrast, the YEEI mutant form of Hck is not activated by pYEEI peptide at concentrations up to 500 μm. Therefore, theK act for YEEI-Hck is more than an order of magnitude higher than WT (Fig. 3 A). The second method we used to show that the SH2 domain of YEEI-Hck was not available for binding exogenous ligands involved the use of a substrate containing a pYEEI motif. Previous experiments from this laboratory showed that WT Hck phosphorylated substrates containing pYEEI sequences at an enhanced rate compared with control substrates with an FEEI sequence (34.Pellicena P. Stowell K.R. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15325-15328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This SH2 domain-pYEEI interaction presumably promotes phosphorylation of other tyrosines within the substrates by raising the effective local concentration of potential phosphorylation sites near the active site. This substrate is not phosphorylated at a higher rate by YEEI-Hck (Fig.3 B). These results suggest that exogenous pYEEI peptide cannot compete with an intramolecular pYEEI motif. The extent to which the intramolecular binding of the SH2 domain affects the ability of SH3 domain ligands to activate Hck is not fully understood. We determined whether a strengthened SH2 domain interaction affects the SH3 domain interaction by measuringK act for Nef, a potent ligand for the SH3 domain of Hck (15.Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 39.Lee C.-H. Leung B. Lemmon M.A. Zheng J. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Saksela K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5006-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). If the intramolecular SH3 domain interaction depended on the affinity of SH2 domain interaction, YEEI-Hck would be expected to have a higher Nef K act. However, YEEI-Hck has a slightly lower K act for Nef than WT (Table I), indicating that the higher affinity SH2 domain interaction does not increase the affinity of the intramolecular SH3 interaction. We also analyzed the binding of Nef by SH3 domains of YEEI-Hck and WT directly. Consistent with the fact that Nef activates WT and YEEI-Hck with a similar K act, Nef binds to WT and YEEI-Hck to a similar extent (Fig. 4). To examine the importance of Glu310, we mutated Glu310 to alanine. We analyzed this mutant using the phosphocellulose paper assay. Preincubated E310A mutant and a WT control were assayed in duplicate in a final concentration of 80 nm enzyme. For E310A, 200 counts/min above background were incorporated into peptide after a 10-min reaction. For WT, 89,800 counts/min above background were incorporated into peptide. Therefore, we estimate that mutation of this one residue decreases kinase activity under these conditions by >400-fold. Phosphorylation of Tyr416 leads to activation of Hck (15.Moarefi I.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14843-14851Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In the absence of SH2 or SH3 ligands, autophosphorylation is a relatively slow, intermolecular process (15.Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Displacement of the regulatory apparatus dramatically increases the rate of autophosphorylation (15.Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The proposed connection between phosphorylation and activation is that phosphorylation of Tyr416 causes a conformational change in the activation loop that causes it to move out of the catalytic site (Fig.2 B). Before Hck has undergone autophosphorylation, the activation loop containing Tyr416 blocks the active site such that peptide substrate cannot bind (7.Schindler T. Sicheri F. Pico A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). This blockage of the active site likely increases substrate K m and lowers the rate of substrate turnover. However, we are unable to accurately measure the kinetics of nonautophosphorylated Hck because addition of ATP to Hck immediately results in the formation of some amount of autophosphorylated Hck, producing a mixture of autophosphorylated and nonautophosphorylated Hck. In the first 5 min after the addition of ATP, autophosphorylated Hck phosphorylates 12-fold more substrate than Hck that has not been preincubated with Hck (Fig.5, inset). Since autophosphorylation significantly increases the activity of Hck, the generation of even a small amount of autophosphorylated Hck prevents us from obtaining accurate kinetic measurements for nonautophosphorylated Hck. To further investigate the role of autophosphorylation, we generated a mutant in which Tyr416 is mutated to alanine. We reasoned that alanine rather than phenylalanine would be the best substitute for Tyr416. In the structure of down-regulated Hck, a network of hydrogen-bonding interactions involving the side chain of Tyr416 helps to stabilize the activation loop. Neither phenylalanine nor alanine would be able to participate in these hydrogen bonds, so neither change is a good mimic of the unphosphorylated state. A potential problem with any amino acid substitution at Tyr416 is that the conformation of the activation loop could be destabilized and become exposed to solvent. Therefore, we selected alanine to avoid the interaction of the bulky hydrophobic side chain of tyrosine with solvent. The mutant Y416A enzyme has the expected linear relationship between enzyme concentration and activity (data not shown). Since Y416A cannot be activated by autophosphorylation at Tyr416 its activity (V max) is lower than autophosphorylated WT (Table II). However, the Y416A mutant is activated relative to down-regulated Hck (Fig. 5 and Fig. 5 inset). This may be due to the fact that tyrosine is better able than alanine to participate in the contacts in the active site that stabilize the inhibitory conformation of the activation loop. Fig.5 shows that Y416A cannot be activated by autophosphorylation. Nonautophosphorylated WT Hck shows the increase in activity with time that is characteristic of autophosphorylation, whereas Y416A activity is linear with time similar to autophosphorylated Hck.Table IIKinetic parameters for WT Hck and Y416A mutantATPK mPeptideK mV maxpYEEI peptideK actNef K actμmμmμmol min −1 mg −1μmμmWT Hck97 ± 8302 ± 3531 ± 331 ± 618 ± 3Y416A71 ± 3647 ± 9212 ± 187 ± 1627 ± 8Kinetic parameters were determined using the spectrophotometric assay.

Wild-type Hck was preincubated with ATP to allow autophosphorylation on Tyr416 prior to kinetic analysis. Determinations ofV max, K act, andK m were carried out at 10 nm enzyme. For determination of ATP K m, the peptide concentration was held constant at 600 μm. For determination of peptideK m, the ATP concentration was held constant at 500 μm. Consistent with the fact that autophosphorylation improves peptide binding by moving the activation loop containing Tyr416 out of the active site, the K m value for peptide substrate is 2-fold higher for Y416A than for WT (Table II). TheK m for ATP was not changed by the mutation, indicating that autophosphorylation does not effect the ATP-binding site of Hck (Table II). The K act values for both pYEEI and Nef are increased for Y416A (Table II). This suggests a correlation between activation by autophosphorylation and increased availability of the SH2 and SH3 domains for substrate binding. In this paper, we describe experiments aimed at understanding the opposing roles of Tyr527 and Tyr416 in regulation of Src family kinases. Our model, based on structural analysis (7.Schindler T. Sicheri F. Pico A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and kinetic data (Table II), is that the Y416A mutant is intermediate between unphosphorylated and autophosphorylated WT, both in terms of its predicted structure and its enzymatic activity. Y416A is not a perfect mimic of the unphosphorylated state because alanine cannot participate in the contacts in the active site that stabilize the inhibitory conformation of the activation loop. However, kinetic data from Y416A sheds light on the properties of unphosphorylated WT Hck. Our observation that Y416A has a lower V maxthan WT (Table II) supports the structural work showing that autophosphorylation stabilizes the activation loop in an active conformation (7.Schindler T. Sicheri F. Pico A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The K m for peptide substrate is higher for Y416A than WT (Table II), consistent with the hypothesis that the activation loop blocks the peptide-binding site when Tyr416 is unphosphorylated. The K m for ATP is unchanged (Table II), indicating that phosphorylation and subsequent rearrangement of the active site does not appear to affect the ATP-binding site.

Biol. 1997; 4: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) is necessary for activity. Glu310 on helix αC forms an ion-pair with Lys295 that stabilizes the inward conformation. Our results on the E310A mutant provide evidence that Glu310 is indispensable for kinase activity and strongly suggest that the active conformation of Src family kinases absolutely requires the ion pair between Glu310 and Lys295 for activity. Our data also support the idea of cross-talk between the active site and the intramolecular binding of SH2 and SH3 domains. TheK act values for both pYEEI and Nef are increased for Y416A relative to WT (Table II). This suggests that Hck has a higher tendency to bind exogenous ligands once it is autophosphorylated. Consistent with this, theK act of an SH3 ligand is 10-fold higher for nonautophosphorylated Hck than for autophosphorylated Hck. 2M. Porter, W. T. Miller, J. Nguyen, and W. Lim, unpublished observations. Although there appears to be a synergistic effect between ligand binding and autophosphorylation, it is not known whether ligand binding precedes autophosphorylation or is a result of autophosphorylation for Hckin vivo. It has previously been shown that binding of exogenous ligands promotes autophosphorylation (31.LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Pico A. Porter M. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32129-32134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This work shows that the converse may also be true: autophosphorylation promotes exogenous ligand binding. The temporal order of autophosphorylation and ligand binding may vary for Src family kinases in vivo depending on the cell type and signaling stimulus. However, the interdependence of autophosphorylation and ligand binding suggests the following scenario: binding of an initial ligand activates Hck and triggers autophosphorylation. Once autophosphorylated, Hck has an enhanced ability to bind other downstream binding partners and substrates. We also engineered a mutant form of Hck with a high affinity intramolecular SH2 ligand in the C-terminal tail. Although binding of the SH2 domain to intramolecular ligand is known to be involved in down-regulating the enzyme, the YEEI-Hck mutant had similar values ofV max and K m(ATP) to WT (TableI). The main effect of increasing the affinity of the intramolecular SH2 ligand was that YEEI-Hck could not be activated by exogenous pYEEI-containing ligands (Fig. 2 A and Table I). Furthermore, because the SH2 domain could not bind exogenous ligands, YEEI-Hck did not preferentially phosphorylate substrates containing SH2 domain ligands (Fig. 2 B). Although YEEI-Hck was unable to bind exogenous SH2 ligand-containing peptides, its ability to bind and be activated by an SH3 domain ligand was comparable to WT (Fig. 4 and Table I). This indicates that the SH3 domain binds ligand in a way that is independent of the intramolecular binding of the SH2 domain. Disruption of the SH3 interaction with ligand can override a strengthened SH2-tail interaction. These observations suggest that SH3 domains have a major role in directing Src kinase-signaling pathways. The Src SH3 domain ligand interaction has been demonstrated to be required for targeting to Sin (18.Cartwright C.A. Eckhart W. Simon S. Kaplan P.L.

Our results for YEEI-Hck provide evidence for the model depicted in Fig. 1. The naturally occurring intramolecular ligand for the SH2 domain of Hck, pYQQQ, has low affinity; this permits exogenous high affinity ligands (such as pYEEI) to displace the C-terminal tail and activate the enzyme. The intramolecular interactions in Src family kinases have been fine-tuned to be strong enough to help maintain the catalytic domain in its down-regulated conformation but weak enough to respond to a variety of cellular stimuli. We thank P. Pellicena for helpful discussions and for initial experiments on substrates containing pYEEI motifs."

The agonist-promoted active state initiates signaling and, presumably, is then phosphorylated and internalized to terminate the signal. In this study, we examined the phosphorylation and internalization of wild type and constitutively active mutants (N111A and N111G) of the type 1 (AT1A) angiotensin II receptor. Cells expressing these receptors were stimulated with angiotensin II (AngII) and [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII, an analog that only activates signaling through the constitutive receptors. Wild type AT1A receptors displayed a basal level of phosphorylation, which was stimulated by AngII. Unexpectedly, the constitutively active AT1A receptors did not exhibit an increase in basal phosphorylation nor was phosphorylation enhanced by AngII stimulation. Phosphorylation of the constitutively active receptors was unaffected by pretreatment with the non-peptide AT1 receptor inverse agonist, EXP3174, and was not stimulated by the selective ligand, [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII. Paradoxically, [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII produced a robust (∼85% of AngII), dose-dependent phosphorylation of the wild type AT1A receptor at sites in the carboxyl terminus similar to those phosphorylated by AngII. Moreover, internalization of both wild type and constitutive receptors was induced by AngII, but not [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII, providing a differentiation between the phosphorylated and internalized states. These data suggest that the AT1A receptor can attain a conformation for phosphorylation without going through the conformation required for inositol phosphate signaling and provide evidence for a transition of the receptor through multiple states, each associated with separate stages of receptor activation and regulation.

The active R* conformation is selected (or induced) by agonist binding and couples to and activates G proteins, which initiate signaling. This two-state model has been revised to include two active states, R* and R**, in the so-called three-state model (5.Leff P. Scaramellini C. Law C. McKechnie K. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 355-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 6.Scaramellini C. Leff P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 861: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which accommodates experimental evidence that one receptor can couple to different G protein effector pathways with distinct agonist potency profiles. In either model, the active states are then targeted for phosphorylation by specific GPCR kinases (GRKs), which only recognize the active conformation, and by second messenger-activated kinases (e.g. protein kinase C). Proteins termed arrestins bind to phosphorylated receptors and sterically hinder further association of the receptor with G protein and thereby terminate signaling (7.Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). For some GPCRs, arrestins also act as adaptors to target the receptors for clathrin-mediated internalization (7.Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar) and to promote coupling to tyrosine kinase signaling pathways (8.Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y.

Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar).Experimental evidence for R and R*/R** has come from the observation that overexpression of many GPCRs leads to some degree of constitutive (or agonist-independent) activity, ostensibly by increasing the overall amount (not the proportion) of R*/R** available to interact with G proteins (1.Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 4.Leurs R. Smit M.J. Alewijnse A.E. Timmerman H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Moreover, constitutively active GPCRs can arise from naturally occurring and engineered mutations (9.Pauwels P.J. Wurch T. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 17: 109-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), presumably as a result of transforming the receptor to an active state. Generally, these constitutively active GPCRs have proven to be constitutively phosphorylated and desensitized (4.Leurs R. Smit M.J. Alewijnse A.E. Timmerman H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), providing support for the model that the active state is also the conformation targeted for phosphorylation, internalization and desensitization.Type 1 angiotensin receptors (AT1) are GPCRs that mediate the actions of angiotensin II (AngII), an octapeptide hormone (Asp1-Arg2-Val3-Tyr4-Ile5-His6-Pro7-Phe8) which regulates blood pressure and water and salt balance. Stimulation of AT1 receptors (two subtypes, AT1A and AT1B, exist in rodents) leads to Gαq/11-mediated activation of phospholipase C-β1, which generates diacylglycerol and inositol (1,4,5)trisphosphate. No naturally occurring, constitutively active AT1 receptor mutants have been reported, but engineered mutation of Asn111 to glycine (N111G) or alanine (N111A), in the third transmembrane helix of the AT1A receptor, leads to partial activation (10.Noda K. Feng Y.H. Liu X.P. Saad Y. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16435-16442Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 11.Groblewski T. Maigret B. Larguier R. Lombard C. Bonnafous J.C.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15791-15798Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, in the absence of AngII binding, the N111G mutant displays ∼50%, and the N111A mutant ∼20% (10.Noda K. Feng Y.H. Liu X.P. Saad Y. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16435-16442Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), of the maximal agonist-induced production of inositol phosphates. In the wild type AT1A receptor, interaction of Tyr4 of AngII with Asn111 in the receptor appears to act as the trigger to convert R to R* and allow receptor activation. Small side-chain substitutions (glycine/alanine) of Asn111 in AT1A presumably release this conformational switch, allowing constitutive activity and removing the requirement of Tyr4 in AngII for maximal receptor activation.In this study, we examined the phosphorylation and internalization of the N111A and N111G constitutively active mutants of the AT1A receptor. We anticipated that these mutants would display an elevated basal phosphorylation to parallel their enhanced G protein-phospholipase C-β1 coupling. Instead, we observed that the phosphorylation of the constitutively active AT1Areceptors is not increased basally or following stimulation by AngII. The constitutively active receptors retained the ability to internalize in response to AngII. Rather surprisingly, the non-signaling AngII analog, [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII, induced robust phosphorylation of the wild type AT1A receptor, but this analog did not stimulate internalization of either wild type or constitutively active mutant AT1A receptors. Thus, we provide evidence for the existence of multiple AT1Areceptor states capable of selectively mediating various aspects of receptor function.DISCUSSIONIn this study, the phosphorylation and internalization of wild type and mutant AT1A receptors following stimulation by AngII and an analog, [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII, was examined. We observed that the constitutively active AT1Areceptors (N111A and N111G) are poor substrates for phosphorylation and that this cannot be modulated by AngII or [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII stimulation or by prior conversion of the constitutive receptors to the basal state by pretreatment with the inverse agonist, EXP3174. Unexpectedly, the wild type receptor was efficiently phosphorylated by the supposedly inactive analog, [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII, indicating that the molecular switches required for phosphorylation are distinct from those necessary for G protein-mediated signaling. The fact that AngII, but not [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII, stimulated the internalization of both wild type and constitutively active AT1A receptors suggests that the processes of internalization and phosphorylation can also be clearly differentiated. Thus, the AT1A receptor appears to exist in multiple conformational states, each relating to a distinct transitional stage of receptor activation (i.e. basal, intermediate, signaling, phosphorylation, and internalization). In Fig.8, we provide a model, which summarizes the proposed transition and interconversion of the AT1Areceptor during the process of receptor activation and regulation.Based on the frequently applied two-state model for receptor activation (3.Leff P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), constitutively active GPCRs are thought to attain a conformation that mimics the active (R*) state and should therefore be recognized and phosphorylated by GRKs. Indeed, a number of constitutively active GPCRs, such as the α2A-adrenergic receptor (20.Ren Q. Kurose H. Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16483-16487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the β2-adrenergic receptor (21.Pei G. Samama P. Lohse M. Wang M. Codina J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2699-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT2C) receptor (22.Westphal R.S. Backstrom J.R. Sanders-Bush E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 200-205PubMed Google Scholar), rhodopsin (23.Rim J. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11938-11945Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and the bradykinin B2 receptor (24.Quitterer U. AbdAlla S. Jarnagin K. Muller-Esterl W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13368-13377Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), have been reported to display enhanced agonist-independent phosphorylation. In support of the idea that the receptor state that propagates signals to G protein is also the one targeted for phosphorylation, January et al. (25.January B. Seibold A. Whaley B. Hipkin R.W. Lin D. Schonbrunn A. Barber R. Clark R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23871-23879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) demonstrated that, for a series of β2-adrenergic receptor agonists of varying coupling efficiencies, the degree of agonist strength on the wild type β2-adrenergic receptor correlated well with the capacity to mediate phosphorylation, internalization, and desensitization. In contrast to these studies, we observed that the constitutively active AT1A receptors displayed a basal level of phosphorylation, which was similar to the unstimulated wild type receptor, and that this basal phosphorylation was not increased by stimulation with AngII or the substituted analog, [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII. The fact that AngII and [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII can cause maximal inositol phosphate signaling through the constitutively active receptors (10.Noda K. Feng Y.H. Liu X.P. Saad Y. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16435-16442Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) argues against the assumption that the active, signaling state of GPCRs is the form recognized by GRKs and targeted for phosphorylation.A distinction between signaling and phosphorylation is also sustained by our discovery that the AngII analog, [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII, causes robust phosphorylation of the wild type AT1A receptor. Remarkably, this occurs despite an inability of this analog to promote Gαq-mediated inositol phosphate signaling through the AT1A receptor (10.Noda K. Feng Y.H. Liu X.P. Saad Y. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16435-16442Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Maximal [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII-mediated phosphorylation was about 85% of that produced by AngII, and relative to its affinity for the wild type receptor, was as efficacious as AngII at inducing phosphorylation. Moreover, [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII seemingly mediates phosphorylation at the same sites as AngII in the receptor carboxyl terminus, based on a similar degree of inhibition of phosphorylation for wild type and carboxyl-terminally mutated receptors. Thus, to our knowledge, this represents the first example of an apparently “silent” analog, with respect to signaling, being able to generate almost complete “agonist-like” phosphorylation. Given the robust nature of [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII-induced phosphorylation as well as the apparent similarity of sites phosphorylated in the AT1A carboxyl terminus by AngII and [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII, this strongly suggests that this analog is stabilizing a conformation in the AT1A receptor that is an excellent substrate for GRK-mediated phosphorylation.Our observation that the optimal conformation for GRK-mediated phosphorylation is different from that which couples the receptor to G protein signaling, corroborates, and can be most directly compared, to a very recent study (26.Mhaouty-Kodja S. Barak L.S. Scheer A. Abuin L. Diviani D. Caron M.G. Cotecchia S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) of constitutively active α1B-adrenergic receptors. In their study, Mhaouty-Kodjaet al. (26.Mhaouty-Kodja S. Barak L.S. Scheer A. Abuin L. Diviani D. Caron M.G. Cotecchia S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) investigated the phosphorylation and internalization of α1B-adrenergic receptors made constitutively active through mutation at two separate sites in the receptor molecule: Asp142 in the DRY motif at the end of the third transmembrane-spanning domain and Ala293 in the carboxyl-terminal region of the third intracellular loop. Mutations at Ala293 (A293I and A293E) caused constitutive signaling (inositol phosphate production), which correlated well with an enhanced basal (agonist-independent) receptor phosphorylation. In direct contrast, mutations at Asp142 (D142A and D142T), despite yielding greater levels of constitutive activation compared with the Ala293 mutants, showed no increase in basal phosphorylation as well as a lack of epinephrine-induced phosphorylation. This result, which is very similar to our data on the phosphorylation of the AT1A Asn111 mutants, suggests that multiple conformations exist for receptor activation, only some of which serve as targets for phosphorylation. That both Asp142 in the α1B-adrenergic receptor and Asn111 of the AT1A receptor are located in the third transmembrane-spanning region, albeit at different levels of the helix, may be relevant to these similar observations and points to a shared mechanism of constitutive activity.Phosphorylation of the AT1A receptor carboxyl terminus has been implicated in the mechanism of receptor internalization. Progressive truncation of the AT1A carboxyl terminus (13.Thomas W.G. Motel T.J. Kule C.E. Karoor V. Baker K.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1513-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar,14.Smith R.D. Hunyady L. Olivares-Reyes J.A. Mihalik B. Jayadev S. Catt K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), or specific mutation of serine and threonine residues in the central region of the receptor tail (Thr332–Ser338) to alanine (13.Thomas W.G. Motel T.J. Kule C.E. Karoor V. Baker K.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1513-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), produces a concomitant decrease in both receptor phosphorylation and internalization. It was therefore somewhat surprising in the present study to observe that, despite the lack of AngII-mediated phosphorylation of N111A and N111G, the internalization kinetics for125I-AngII of N111A was unaffected and only slightly reduced in the case of N111G. This would suggest that AngII-induced phosphorylation of the AT1A receptor is not mandatory for internalization. Moreover, given the strong phosphorylation of the wild type receptor by [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII, in the absence of appreciable internalization, it would appear that phosphorylation is incapable of driving the internalization process. Taken together, these observations support the concept of separate receptor states for receptor phosphorylation and for targeting receptors for endocytosis.Similarly, clear distinctions can also be drawn between the signaling and internalizing forms of the AT1A receptor. Specifically, [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII can produce maximal inositol phosphate signaling through the constitutively active AT1A receptors (10.Noda K. Feng Y.H. Liu X.P. Saad Y. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16435-16442Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), suggesting it can promote a conformation in the receptor that approximates the active R*. However, we observed no internalization of constitutive or wild type receptors in response to saturating concentrations (30 μm) of this analog. Additionally, we (27.Thomas W.G. Thekkumkara T.J. Baker K.M. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. Suppl. 1996; 3: S74-S80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and others (28.Conchon S. Monnot C. Teutsch B. Corvol P. Clauser E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) have previously reported that another AngII analog, [Sar1,Ile8]AngII, which signals very poorly through the wild type receptor (10.Noda K. Feng Y.H. Liu X.P. Saad Y. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16435-16442Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), is capable of causing a degree of AT1A receptor internalization that approximates that of AngII. This separation of signaling and internalization is corroborated by earlier reports, which showed that some G protein uncoupled AT1A receptors mutants (e.g. D74E, Y302A), with severely compromised signaling to AngII (29.Bihoreau C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16602-16609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that truncation of the AT1A carboxyl terminus produces a receptor mutant that couples well to G protein and signals in response to AngII stimulation, but exhibits vastly reduced internalization (16.Thomas W.G. Thekkumkara T.J. Motel T.J. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 207-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The literature contains many such examples of GPCR mutants that are uncoupled from signaling but retain a capacity for robust internalization or fully signaling receptors that are compromised with respect to endocytosis. Hence, it appears likely that GPCRs in general are able to attain a conformation(s) that allows specific interaction with components of the internalization machinery while preventing productive coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins.Important clues as to the role of individual amino acid residues in the octapeptide, AngII, in promoting various receptor states can be gleaned from a comparison of the receptor functions evoked by the AngII analogs, [Sar1,Ile8]AngII and [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII. For example, both analogs poorly activate inositol phosphate production (10.Noda K. Feng Y.H. Liu X.P. Saad Y. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16435-16442Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), indicating the crucial role for Tyr4 and Phe8 of AngII in specifying agonism, in particular Phe8 (for full discussion, see Ref. 31.Miura S. Feng Y.H. Husain A. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7103-7110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Moreover, both analogs cause robust phosphorylation of the wild type receptor (Ref. 13.Thomas W.G. Motel T.J. Kule C.E. Karoor V. Baker K.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1513-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholarand this study), indicating that docking of Tyr4 and Phe8 of AngII onto their respective partners in the AT1A receptor (i.e. Asn111 in transmembrane helix 3 and His256 in transmembrane domain 6), is dispensable for promoting a conformation required for phosphorylation. These analogs do differ in that [Sar1,Ile8]AngII (27.Thomas W.G. Thekkumkara T.J. Baker K.M. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. Suppl. 1996; 3: S74-S80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Conchon S. Monnot C. Teutsch B. Corvol P. Clauser E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), but not [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII (this study), causes robust internalization, identifying Tyr4 in AngII as a crucial determinant of AT1A receptor endocytosis. Despite the unequivocal importance of the aromatic-amide bond between Tyr4 in AngII and Asn111 in AT1A for receptor activation (31.Miura S. Feng Y.H. Husain A. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7103-7110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), it is interesting that the constitutively active Asn111 mutants (N111A and N111G) retain a capacity for AngII-induced internalization. Perhaps other points of contact made between Tyr4 and the receptor (e.g. Phe77, Val108, Leu112, and Tyr292), suggested by our molecular modeling studies, may be more important for dictating internalization. In regard to inducing phosphorylation, positions other than Tyr4 and Phe8 of AngII must be involved, and it will therefore be important to examine the capacity for phosphorylation of AngII analogs substituted at other positions.In conclusion, data from the present study, as well as accumulating evidence from other GPCRs (32.Negishi M. Hasegawa H. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 33.Perez D.M. Hwa J. Gaivin R. Mathur M. Brown F. Graham R.M. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2240-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), strongly support the notion of multiple receptor conformational states and the transition of receptors through these states in the process of receptor activation and deactivation. Using constitutively active AT1A receptor mutants and novel analogs of AngII, which select different transitional phases of receptor activation, has provided a unique insight into the physical separation of these putative conformational states. Activation selective analogs, such as [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII, represent powerful tools to further dissect the molecular mechanisms that underlie the generation of GPCR signals and their subsequent termination by phosphorylation, internalization, and desensitization. Seven transmembrane-spanning receptors that couple to heterotrimeric guanyl nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins)1 are activated by an array of sensory and hormonal stimuli. Current theories (1.Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 2.Kenakin T. Trends Pharmacol.

The active R* conformation is selected (or induced) by agonist binding and couples to and activates G proteins, which initiate signaling. This two-state model has been revised to include two active states, R* and R**, in the so-called three-state model (5.Leff P. Scaramellini C. Law C. McKechnie K. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 355-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 6.Scaramellini C. Leff P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 861: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which accommodates experimental evidence that one receptor can couple to different G protein effector pathways with distinct agonist potency profiles. In either model, the active states are then targeted for phosphorylation by specific GPCR kinases (GRKs), which only recognize the active conformation, and by second messenger-activated kinases (e.g. protein kinase C). Proteins termed arrestins bind to phosphorylated receptors and sterically hinder further association of the receptor with G protein and thereby terminate signaling (7.Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). For some GPCRs, arrestins also act as adaptors to target the receptors for clathrin-mediated internalization (7.Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar) and to promote coupling to tyrosine kinase signaling pathways (8.Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y.

Although Stat4 is activated by interleukin (IL)-12 in both human and murine T cells, Stat4 is activated by interferon (IFN)-α only in human, but not murine, CD4+ T cells. This species-specific difference in cytokine activation of Stat4 underlies critical differences in Th1 development in response to cytokines and is important to the interpretation of murine models of immunopathogenesis. Here, we sought to determine the mechanism of Stat4 recruitment and activation by the human IFN-α receptor. Analysis of phosphopeptide binding analysis suggests that Stat4 does not interact directly with tyrosine-phosphorylated amino acid residues within the cytoplasmic domains of either of the subunits of the IFN-α receptor complex. Expression of murine Stat4 in the Stat1-deficient U3A and the Stat2-deficient U6A cell lines shows that IFN-α-induced Stat4 phosphorylation requires the presence of activated Stat2 but not Stat1.

Manetti R. Simonelli C. Sampognaro S. Piccinni M.-P. Macchia D. Maggi E. Del Prete G. Romangnani S. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2977-2983PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Brinkmann V. Geiger T. Alkan S.

In murine CD4+ T cells, IL-12 is unique among the known cytokines in activating Stat4 in directing Th1 development. In contrast, in human CD4+ T cells, both IL-12 and IFN-α can activate Stat4 and induce IFN-γ production characteristic of Th1 cells (9.Cho S. Bacon C.M. Sudarshan C. Rees R.C. Finbloom D. Pine R.

Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). In addition, the human IFN-α receptor was recently shown to recruit and activate Stat4 (10.Rogge L. D'Ambrosio D. Biffi M. Penna G. Minetti L.J. Presky D.H. Adorini L. Sinigaglia F. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6567-6574PubMed Google Scholar). Although the role for Stat4 in human Th1 development has not been formally demonstrated, Stat4 plays a critical role in murine Th1 development (4.Kaplan M.H. Sun Y.-L. Hoey T. Grusby M.J. Nature. 1996; 382: 174-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 5.Thierfelder W.E. van Deursen J.M. Yamamoto K. Tripp R.A. Sarawar S.R. Carson R.T. Sangster M.Y. Vignali D.A. Doherty P.C.

It therefore seems likely that the ability of IFN-α to activate Stat4 in human but not mouse cells explains its ability to induce Th1 development in human but not mouse T cells. In the present study, we wished to define the mechanism of Stat4 recruitment in human IFN-α signaling as a starting point to understand the basis of the species-specific difference in Th1 development. In this report, we demonstrate an important difference between Stat4 activation by the IL-12 and IFN-α signaling pathways. In IL-12 signaling, Stat4 is recruited directly to the receptor complex by the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-12R β2 subunit (18.Naeger L.K. McKinney J. Salvekar A. Hoey T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1875-1878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, in IFN-α signaling, Stat4 is not recruited directly to the receptor but appears to be indirectly recruited through an intermediate involving activated Stat2.

The peptide sequences for the cytoplasmic domains of the IFN-α/β receptors are as follows: IFNAR1 subunit: Tyr466, RCINYVFFY(PO4)SLKPSS; Tyr481, SIDEY(PO4)FSEQPLKNLL; Tyr527, DEDHKKY(PO4)SSQTSQDSGN; and Tyr538, DSGNY(PO4)SNEDESESKSEEL; IFNAR2 subunit: Tyr269, KWIGY(PO4)ICLRNSLPKVL; Tyr306, MVEVIY(PO4)INRKKKVWD; Tyr316/318, KVWDY(PO4)NY(PO4)DDESDSDT; Tyr337, SGGGY(PO4)TMHGLTVRPL; Tyr411, PEEDY(PO4)SSTEGSGGRIT; and Tyr512, TSESDVDLGDGY(PO4)IMR.

The control peptide from the IL-12R β2 cytoplasmic tail was DLPTHDGY(PO4)LPSNIDD. All peptides were purified by reverse phase C18-HPLC, and their purity and molecular weights were determined by mass spectrometry. Synthetic peptides used in this study were determined to be >85% pure and of the correct molecular weight for each species. The DO11.10 Th1 clone, 3F6, was maintained by weekly stimulation with irradiated BALB/c spleen cells pulsed with the ovalbumin peptide as described previously (22.Hsieh C.-S. Heimberger A.B.

Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were purified by Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma) and stimulated for 3 days in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 5 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin antigen (PHA, Sigma) and 40 units/ml IL-2. The PHA-blasts were split on day 3 in complete RPMI containing 40 units/ml IL-2 and rested to day 7. The parental 2fTGH, the Stat2-deficient U6A, and the Stat1-deficient U3A cell lines were maintained in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described previously (24.McKendry R. John J.

The 2fTGH, U3A, and U6A cell lines were infected by overnight culture in retroviral culture supernatant containing 4 μg/ml polybrene (1,5-dimethyl-1,5-diazaundecamethylene polymethobromide, Sigma). Transduced cells were purified by FACS sorting for GFP expression. Sorted cells were expanded in culture for 1 week and were then determined to be >90% pure and to stably express the retroviral marker protein by post-sort analysis. Analysis of phosphotyrosine-containing Stat proteins was performed as described previously (2.Jacobson N.G. Szabo S.J. Weber-Nordt R.M. Zhong Z. Schreiber R.D. Darnell J.E. Murphy K.M. J. Exp.

Whole-cell lysates were prepared, and STAT molecules were precipitated with specific polyclonal antibodies and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitates were resolved by denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were transferred to nitrocellulose. Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were detected by blotting with the peroxidase-conjugated RC20 antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were then stripped and re-probed with anti-Stat polyclonal antibodies followed by detection with peroxidase-conjugated Gt-anti-Rb Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA).

Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Supershifting polyclonal antibodies were added to some samples (2 μg) and incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature. DNA-binding complexes were resolved by nondenaturing 4.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for 2 h at 150 V followed by autoradiography. The DNA probes used in this study were as follows: M67 SIE, GTCGACATTTCCCGTAAATCGTCGA; FcγRI, TCGACGCATGTTTCAAGGATTTGAGATGTATTTCCCAGAAAAGGCTCGA; Eα-Y Box, TCGACATTTTTCTGATTGGTTAAAAGTC. For peptide competition studies, nuclear extracts were first denatured with the addition of 200 mm guanidinium HCl for 2 min at room temperature prior to their addition to the DNA binding reaction mixtures as described previously (27.Yan H. Krishnan K. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S. Lim J.T.E. Schreiber R.D. Schindler C.W. Krolewski J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These binding reactions included purified phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated peptides, as indicated in the text, at concentrations ranging from 20 to 100 μm. First, to confirm the reported differences in Stat4 activation by IFN-α between mouse and human, we compared the murine Th1 clone 3F6 and human Th1 cells derived by PHA activationin vitro as described under “Materials and Methods.” For IL-12 signaling, murine or human Th1 cells were treated with recombinant murine or human IL-12, respectively. For IFN-α signaling, murine and human Th1 cells were treated with hIFN-A/D, which activates both murine and human IFN-α receptors. IL-12 induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat4 in both murine and human T cells (Fig.1 A, lanes 2 and5). IL-12 also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 in both species, although more strongly in human compared with murine cells (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, IFN-α induced tyrosine phosphorylation Stat4 and Stat3 only in human T cells but not in murine T cells (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 6). In addition, IFN-α induced Stat4 DNA binding activity in human (Fig.1 B, lower panel, lanes 6 and9), but not mouse, Th1 cells (Fig. 1 B, upper panel, lanes 6–9). The lack of Stat4 activation by IFN-α in murine T cells was not due to inactivity of the hIFN-α (A/D) at murine hIFN-α receptors, because hIFN-α (A/D) strongly induced Stat1 DNA binding in murine Th1 cells (Fig. 1 B, upper panel, lanes 6–9). Furthermore, DNA-binding complexes induced by mIFN-α (A) were similar to hIFN-α (A/D) (not shown). These results confirm the report of Rogge et al. (10.Rogge L. D'Ambrosio D. Biffi M. Penna G. Minetti L.J. Presky D.H. Adorini L. Sinigaglia F. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6567-6574PubMed Google Scholar) that IFN-α signaling activates Stat4 in human and not murine T cells. However, that recent report did not address the mechanism underlying this difference. Differential Stat4 activation could be caused by sequence variations in the IFN-α receptor subunits, particularly phosphotyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domains that may act as binding sites for Stat4. Indeed, amino acid sequences of the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 subunits are not well conserved between mouse and human (28.Kim S.H. Cohen B. Novick D. Rubinstein M. Gene. 1997; 196: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 29.Owczarek C.M. Hwang S.Y. Holland K.A. Gulluyam L.M. Tavaria M. Weaver B. Reich N.C. Kola I. Hertzog P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23865-23870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the ability of specific phosphotyrosine-containing peptides from the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 subunits to interact with STAT complexes by EMSA (Fig. 2). Tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domains of the IFNAR1 (Tyr466, Tyr481, Tyr527, and Tyr538) and IFNAR2 (Tyr269, Tyr306, Tyr316, Tyr318, Tyr337, Tyr411, and Tyr512) receptor subunits could serve as recruitment sites for Stat4. Phosphopeptides corresponding to amino acids surrounding each of the potential tyrosines were tested for their abilities to disrupt Stat4 DNA binding activity as a measure of sequence-specific binding (27.Yan H. Krishnan K. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S. Lim J.T.E. Schreiber R.D. Schindler C.W. Krolewski J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). As controls, we used phosphotyrosine- and a nonphosphotyrosine-containing peptide consisting of the Stat4 recruitment site from the cytoplasmic domain of the human IL-12R β2 subunit (18.Naeger L.K. McKinney J. Salvekar A. Hoey T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1875-1878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (IL-12Rβ2-T-P-800) as a positive control for Stat4 DNA binding activity and a peptide from the Stat1 recruitment site of the IFN-γ receptor, IFNγR-Y-440 (positive control for Stat1 DNA binding activity) (30.Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 7: 1591-1600Crossref Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from hIFN-α (A/D)-treated human Kit225 cells as a source of Stat1 and Stat4 DNA-binding complexes. First, the specificity of these complexes was confirmed by using anti-Stat1 and anti-Stat4 antibodies in supershift assays (Fig. 2, first and second panels). Next, we demonstrated that the hStat4 SH2-dependent phosphopeptide hStat4-Y-P-694 and the IFN-γ receptor phosphopeptide IFNγR-Y-P-440 potently inhibited Stat4 and Stat1 complexes, respectively, in EMSA (Fig. 2, first and second panels). These data are consistent with the ability of these phosphopeptide sequences to interact with the SH2 domains of Stat4 and Stat1. This inhibition was specific, because the nonphosphorylated versions of these peptides did not block STAT binding in the EMSA. Next, we asked whether phosphotyrosine peptides from either the IFNAR1 or the IFNAR2 could inhibit Stat1 or Stat4 binding activity by EMSA (Fig. 2, third and fourth panels). All of the phosphopeptides from the IFNAR1 (Tyr466, Tyr481, Tyr527, and Tyr538) and IFNAR2 (Tyr269, Tyr306, Tyr316, Tyr318, Tyr337, Tyr411, and Tyr512) were tested in this EMSA binding assay. Fig. 2shows two representative experiments from the analysis of phosphopeptides from the IFNAR1 (third panel) and the IFNAR2 (fourth panel). Surprisingly, none of the phosphotyrosine-containing peptides from either the IFNAR1 (Tyr466, Tyr481, Tyr538 (Fig. 2,third panel), and Tyr527 (data not shown)) or IFNAR2 (Tyr306, Tyr316 (Fig. 2, fourth panel) and Tyr269, Tyr318, Tyr337, Tyr411, and Tyr512 (data not shown)) subunits inhibited Stat4 complex formation. Interestingly, a phospohopeptide containing tyrosine 306 of IFNRA2 (IFN-αR2-Y-P306) potently inhibited Stat1 binding (Fig. 2, fourth panel). This inhibition was specific, because IFN-αR2-Y-P306 did not inhibit Stat4 binding. In summary, whereas phosphotyrosine peptide sequences expected to interact with Stat1 did selectively inhibit Stat1 binding in EMSA, none of the phosphotyrosine-containing peptide sequences from either the IFNAR1 or IFNAR2 receptor chain subunits showed significant interaction with Stat4. These results indicate that Stat4 either does not interact with, or interacts only very weakly with, any of the phosphotyrosine-containing regions in the cytoplasmic domain of IFNRA1 and IFNAR2. This finding suggests that, potentially, Stat4 may not be recruited by direct receptor interactions but rather indirectly via an intermediate adapter molecule. Previous studies showed that Stat2 acts as a docking site for the recruitment of Stat1 in IFN-α receptor signaling (31.Leung S. Qureshi S.A. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1312-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During IFN-α signaling, Stat2 is first recruited to specific residues from the cytoplasmic domain of the IFNAR1 receptor subunit (27.Yan H. Krishnan K. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S. Lim J.T.E. Schreiber R.D. Schindler C.W. Krolewski J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 32.Li X. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2048-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Stat2 next becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine 690 (33.Improta T. Schindler C. Horvath C.M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4776-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and the surrounding region (YLKHR) serves as a docking site for the SH2-dependent recruitment of Stat1 (31.Leung S. Qureshi S.A. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1312-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Qureshi S.A. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Stat1 docking presumably allows for its subsequent phosphorylation by receptor-associated kinases. Based on these observations, we wondered whether Stat4 might be recruited to the receptor complex by a similar STAT-dependent mechanism. To determine whether Stat4 activation proceeds by a similar Stat2-dependent mechanism, we used cells deficient in specific components of IFN-α signaling to determine which component may be responsible for Stat4 recruitment. The U6A cell line, derived from the parental line 2fTGH, has an uncharacterized mutation of Stat2 causing a defect in Stat2 protein expression (24.McKendry R. John J. Flavell R.A. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11455-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 31.Leung S. Qureshi S.A. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1312-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Qureshi S.A. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The U6A mutation prevents IFN-α-induced phosphorylation of Stat2 and also prevents IFN-α-induced phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3 (Fig.3). The U6R cell line is derived from U6A by stable transfection with a Stat2 expression plasmid. Direct use of U6A for analysis of Stat4 activation is not possible because these cells do not express Stat4 (Fig. 3, bottom panel). To analyze Stat4 phosphorylation in these cells, we stably expressed Stat4 in 2fTGH, U6A, and U6R cells by retrovirus (Fig.4). In parental line 2fTGH, IFN-α induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 with or without introduction of murine Stat4 (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2 and4). Also, IFN-α induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat4 in Stat4-expressing 2fTGH cells (Fig. 4 A, lane 4) but not in non-Stat4-expressing cells (lane 2). This result demonstrates that murine Stat4 can be recruited and activated by the human IFN-α signaling complex, similar to human Stat4. In the U6A cells, which lack Stat2, IFN-α failed to induce Stat1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5 and 6). Introduction of murine Stat4 did not affect IFN-α activation of Stat1 nor did Stat4 become phosphorylated in response to IFN-α in the absence of Stat2 (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, in the Stat2-reconstituted U6R cell line, IFN-α did induce Stat1 and Stat4 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A, lane 10). This result suggests that Stat2 participates in the recruitment of both Stat1 and Stat4 to the IFN-α signaling complex. Moreover, Stat2-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat4 was correlated with activation and phosphorylation of Stat2 in response to IFN-α (Fig.4 B). Because Stat1 recruitment to the IFN-α receptor is dependent on Stat2 activation, we wondered whether Stat1, in addition to Stat2, was required for Stat4 activation by hIFN-α. As shown in Fig.4 B, IFN-α induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat4 in both the 2fTGH control and in the Stat1-deficient U3A cell line (Fig.4 B, lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 was seen only in the parental line as expected (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). Thus, these data demonstrate that the activation of Stat4 by the hIFN-α receptor requires the activation of Stat2 but not Stat1. Several possible mechanisms could account for the differential species-specific activation of Stat4 by type I interferons. First, we examined the possibility that Stat4 was activated by direct receptor recruitment to specific phosphorylated tyrosine residue within the cytoplasmic domains of either the IFNAR1 or IFNAR2 subunits. Stat4 was recently shown to bind to a phosphorylated tyrosine-containing sequence, YLPSNID, at Tyr800 in the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-12R β2 (18.Naeger L.K. McKinney J. Salvekar A. Hoey T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1875-1878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This sequence is conserved between the murine and human IL-12R β2 (35.Presky D.H. Yang H. Minetti L.J. Chua A.O. Nabavi N. Wu C.-Y. Gately M.K. Gubler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14002-14007Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). However, there is no conservation of any similar sequence within the cytoplasmic domains of either the IFNAR1 or IFNAR2. Further, peptide competition analysis presented here showed that Stat4 does not significantly interact with any of the tyrosine-phosphorylated sequences derived from either the IFNAR1 or IFNAR2 subunit (Fig. 2). Thus, although the cytoplasmic domains of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 are not well conserved between human and mouse, these differences do not explain the difference in Stat4 activation by the IFN-α receptor. In looking further, we found that Stat4 was activated by IFN-α in a Stat2-dependent manner, similar to the Stat2-dependent activation of Stat1. Thus differences between human and mouse Stat2 could provide a basis for differential Stat4 recruitment between human and mouse. This hypothesis predicts that any receptor that activates Stat2 would also recruit and activate Stat4. However, until recently, Stat2 was known to be activated only by the IFN-α/β pathway, restricting a general test of this hypothesis. A recent report has shown that the urokinase receptor, expressed by human vascular smooth muscle cells, also activates Stat2, and that indeed Stat4 is also activated in response to urokinase signaling (36.Dumler I. Kopmann A. Wagner K. Mayboroda O.A. Jerke U. Dietz R. Haller H. Gulba D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24059-24065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This observation supports the idea that human Stat2 is involved in Stat4 recruitment and activation. Although the human Stat2 sequence has been known for some time (37.Yan R. Qureshi S. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), murine Stat2 was only recently cloned and sequenced (38.Paulson M. Pisharody S. Pan L. Guadagno S. Mui A. Levy D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25343-25349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the overall amino acid sequence identity of murine and human Stat2 was only 69%, with the greatest divergence at the carboxyl terminus, which showed only 29% sequence identity. By comparison, Stats1, 3, 4, 5α, and 6 all share >85% overall sequence identity when aligning the murine sequence to their human counterparts. Although the precise domain within Stat2 that may interact with Stat4 has not been identified, the sequence divergence between murine and human Stat2 suggests a potential explanation for the functional difference in Stat4 activation.

Overexpression of cGMP-dependent protein kinase-1α caused phosphorylation of p38 in these cells and potentiated the effectiveness of cGMP. Overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant form of this enzyme (T516A) blocked the ability of both nitric oxide and 8-bromo-cGMP to activate p38 as measured by both p38 phosphorylation and ATF-2 driven gene expression.

Increases in either cAMP or cGMP are capable of activating both protein kinase A (PKA)1 and protein kinase G (PKG), but the former is responsive to lower levels of cAMP and the latter is more sensitive to cGMP.

The MAP-kinases including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 represent a family of proteins that are activated by phosphorylation by upstream MAPK kinases (MEKs), which are activated in response to growth factors, cytokines, or various forms of cellular stress (21.Paul A.

Several studies have addressed the mechanism of NO-mediated activation of the ERK pathway. In Jurkat and murine neuronal cells activation of ERK is cGMP-independent, and there is evidence for nitrosylation of p21 ras, which can then activate the c-Raf/MEK1,2 pathway (20.Lander H.M.

A. 1998; 95: 5773-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). More recently it has been shown that activation of ERK in endothelial cells by NO required cGMP formation (28.Hood J. Granger H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23504-23508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Furthermore, using KT5823, these authors demonstrated a role for cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) in a process involving phosphorylation and activation of c-Raf. Of interest, the PKG mediated phosphorylation of c-Raf has also been shown to prevent its coupling to Ras and therefore inhibits growth factor-induced ERK activation in baby hamster kidney cells (29.Suhasini M. Li H. Lohmann S.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6983-6994Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus it is likely that NO can activate the ERK pathway using a combination of both events. Despite several reports of the phenomenon in different cell types, the events underlying the activation of JNK or p38 MAP-kinase by NO stimulation remain unclear (14.Callsen D. Brune B.

Recently we reported that NO could specifically activate MEK3 and p38 MAPK in human neutrophils (15.Browning D.D. Windes N.D. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 537-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The importance of PKG in this system has been suggested by the ability of increased cGMP levels to mimic the effect of NO and that KT5823 was able to block p38 MAPK activation by lipopolysaccharide. This study investigated the mechanism of NO induced activation of p38 MAPK. We report that exogenous NO leads to phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in 293T fibroblasts and that this results in ATF-2-dependent gene expression. In addition, it was found that cGMP can mimic this response, and using a catalytic mutant of PKG we demonstrate that this enzyme is essential for both of these functions. BPDEtide, H-89 and, 8-Br-cGMP were obtained from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Protease inhibitor mixture, sodium nitroprusside (SNP-1), and Nonidet P-40 were from Calbiochem. p81 phosphocellulose was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The PKG constructs were cloned as detailed below. Antibodies raised against PKG and PKA-R were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The murine FLAG epitope-tagged VASP protein was a gift from Dr. Michael Uhler (University of Michigan). Wild-type ASK-1 was a gift from Dr. Tatyana Voyno-Yasenetskaya (University of Illinois, Chicago). The dominant negative regulatory subunit for murine PKA (δR1α) was a gift from Dr. Stanley McKnight (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). The cGMP accumulation in response to treatment of 293T cells with nitric oxide was determined using an competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based kit (BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA). For these assays the cells from 10-cm dishes (approximately 2 × 106) were treated with SNP-1, and at various times the cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and divided into two fractions for duplicate measurements. The cell extracts were prepared with 0.1 m HCl, and the cGMP was acylated and quantitated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The human embryonic kidney fibroblast cell line 293T was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific). The cells were grown on 10-cm tissue culture plates and split by repeated pipetting to remove them from the dish. Cells were transfected to express exogenous proteins and reporter constructs using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. In all cases the DNA concentration was kept to 10 μg in 1 ml of precipitate using empty pRK7 vector. DNA precipitate (1 ml for a 10-cm dish or 0.15 ml for a well of a six-well plate, respectively) was added to the cells and incubated for 4 h. After changing the medium cells were incubated for an additional 20–24 h before experimentation. The expression of δR1α driven by the MT-1 promotor was induced by changing the incubation of the transfected cells for an additional 16 h in RPMI 1640 containing 2.5% fetal bovine serum and 100 μmZnCl2. In some studies, including the luciferase reporter experiments, cells were serum starved for 12–16 h before use. Two fragments of PKG1α were cloned by PCR using the PCR-Script vector according to manufacturer instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The template cDNA was prepared by reverse transcriptase using human lung RNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The two fragments were joined using a unique PstI restriction site, and the full-length construct was subcloned into BamHI andEcoRI sites of the pCDNA3.1 expression vector. The PKG1α mutant T516A was made with the 3′ cDNA fragment containing the catalytic region by PCR, and the mutant fragment was joined via thePstI site into PCR-Script vector as mentioned above. Verification of both wild-type and mutant forms of PKG1α was assessed by sequencing, which indicated no mutations from published sequence except for the T516A replacement. Expression of the PKG1α constructs in pCDNA3.1 was assessed by transfecting the 293T cells followed by Western blotting with a commercially available COOH-terminal specific polyclonal anti-bovine PKG antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The kinase activity of the expressed enzymes was measured in cell homogenates using BPDEtide as substrate as detailed previously (31.Collins S.P. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8391-8404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) except that 0.5 μm of the PKA inhibitor H89 was incorporated in the reaction mixture instead of inhibitory peptide. A truncated version of type 1 PKG corresponding to the PKA-C1α catalytic subunit gene was generated by PCR using the full-length coding sequence described above and the fragment subcloned into the pCDNA3.1 expression vector. Assessment of the phosphorylation state of p38 MAPK in 293T cells was accomplished by Western blotting using a polyclonal anti-phospho-p38 MAPK antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Briefly, the medium was removed from cells grown on 10-cm dishes and replaced by serum-free RPMI 1640. After treatment in this medium the plates were immediately placed on ice and the RPMI replaced by 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were removed from the plates by repeated pipetting and harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g at 4 °C. For some experiments cell extracts were made by resuspending the cells in denaturing sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting directly. In these experiments the protein loading in each lane (approximately 20 μg) was assessed by reprobing the blots with antibodies against unphosphorylated p38. In other experiments involving transfection of FLAG epitope-tagged p38 (a generous gift from Dr. J. Han, Scripps Research Institute), the cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 5 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 × protease inhibitor mixture) and agitated at 4 °C for 20 min. Following clarification by centrifugation, the exogenously expressed p38 was immunoprecipitated from the extracts using anti-FLAG M2 coupled to agarose (Eastman Kodak Co.). The p38 in the washed precipitates was then eluted from the beads by incubating 10 min on ice in 400 μg/ml FLAG peptide, and after removing the beads, fractions of the supernatant were analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-phospho-p38 antibody. Reprobing with monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 did standardization of the p38 loading on the blots. In some instances quantitation of p38 MAPK phosphorylation was accomplished by scanning autoradiograms followed by densitometric analysis with ImageQuant software (V3.3, Molecular Dynamics). The intensity of the phosphorylated p38 was standardized with the intensity of the total p38 MAPK and expressed as a ratio of the basal level. Transcriptional activity stimulated by p38 activation was measured using the Path-Detect ATF-2-dependent luciferase reporter assay (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In these experiments the 293T cells were cultured in six-well dishes and transfected with 150 μl of DNA precipitate containing 75 ng of luciferase reporter and 0.4 ng of ATF-2 fusion vector as detailed above. After approximately 36 h the transfected cells were stimulated for 6 additional hours. Luciferase activity in cell lysates was determined using luminol substrate according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The MAPKs are activated by phosphorylation of specific tyrosine and threonine residues by dual specificity MEKs. Thus the phosphorylation state of any MAPK is a good measure of the activation of the enzyme. The ability of the nitric oxide-releasing compound sodium nitroprusside (SNP-1) to activate p38 MAPK in 293T cells was assessed by Western blotting with a polyclonal antiserum specific for the phosphorylated version of p38 MAPK. There was some background phospho-p38 in unstimulated cells, but as early as 5 min after challenge with 100 μm SNP-1, this level increased and was maximal after 15 min (Fig.1 A). A major effector function of NO is guanylyl cyclase, which leads to an increase in cellular cGMP levels. Treatment of 293T cells with 100 μm SNP-1 resulted in a rapid increase in cellular cGMP and was maximal 15–20 min following stimulation (Fig. 1 B). The kinetics of cGMP formation paralleled that of p38 MAPK phosphorylation in response to SNP-1 treatment. Because NO is capable of influencing cell physiology by several means, it was of interest to determine whether cGMP was able to cause p38 MAPK phosphorylation in these cells. To test this hypothesis the membrane-permeable cGMP analogue 8-bromo-cGMP was added to cells and found to induce a rapid increase in the amount of phospho-p38. In these experiments the activity was detectable within 30 s and peaked within 5 min following addition of the 8-Br-cGMP (Fig. 1 C). The stimulation of p38 MAPK phosphorylation by cGMP and SNP-1 were not additive, suggesting that they are part of the same pathway (data not shown). These observations are consistent with the notion that an increase in cellular cGMP levels resulting from activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase was central to NO mediated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in the 293T cells. These data are very similar to those reported in neutrophils indicating that this phenomenon is not restricted to leukocytes. Indeed, we examined the ability of 8-Br-cGMP to stimulate phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in several myeloid lines (THP-1, HL-60, U937) and fibroblast lines (COS-7, HEK-293) and found that this nucleotide was effective although to varying degrees in all cells tested (data not shown). To address in more detail the mechanism underlying the cGMP-stimulated p38 activation, we transiently transfected 293T cells with FLAG epitope-tagged p38 MAPK followed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (Fig. 2 A). Of potential importance was the observation that the increase in phospho-p38 induced by SNP-1 or 8-Br-cGMP was much lower (approximately 2-fold basal levels) than that found in cells stimulated with tumor necrosis factor. The physiological significance of the relatively low levels of p38 phosphorylation by NO and cGMP was tested in terms of the ability of these agents to initiate ATF-2 dependent gene expression. ATF-2 is a well characterized transcription factor that is activated in response to phosphorylation by p38 MAPK. Transfection of ATF-2/luciferase reporter constructs into 293T cells resulted in some basal luciferase activity in the unstimulated cells. Cotransfection of the cells with ASK-1, a MEK kinase known to activate MEK3, resulted in increases in luciferase activity of up to 10-fold (data not shown). Stimulation of 293 cells transfected with the ATF-2/luciferase reporter constructs with 400 ng/ml TNFα for 6 h resulted in a 4-fold increase in the basal luciferase activity (Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, treatment of the cells with SB203580, a potent and specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, was able to block the increase in luciferase activity in the stimulated cells confirming that the increases observed were due to activation of p38 MAPK (data not shown). Stimulation of the cells with either 100 μm SNP-1 or 250 μm 8-Br-cGMP for 6 h produced similar increases in ATF-2-dependent luciferase activity to that of TNFα (Fig.2 B) Although there are several cGMP-binding proteins present in cells, PKG is believed to function in a signaling capacity and has been demonstrated to be downstream of NO (12.Hobbs A.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 484-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Because of the ability of cyclic nucleotides to cross-activate both PKA and PKG, it was important to determine whether the exogenously added 8-Br-cGMP was able to activate PKA. To test this, a cyclic nucleotide unresponsive regulatory subunit for PKA (δR1α), which behaves in a dominant negative fashion, was transfected into 293T cells. To measure the activation of PKA and PKG we took advantage of the fact that VASP is a substrate for both kinases and expressed a FLAG epitope-tagged version, which could be immunoprecipitated from the cells and its phosphorylation measured as a mobility shift on Western blots (31.Collins S.P. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8391-8404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It was found that 250 μm 8-Br-cAMP or cGMP could phosphorylate VASP, but the cAMP was twice as effective (Fig.3 A). The greater efficacy of cAMP likely reflects differences in expression levels of the two kinases as PKG isoforms are generally less abundant. Expression of δR1α effectively blocked the ability of the cAMP to phosphorylate VASP, reducing the amount of phospho-VASP to close to basal levels. Overexpression of δR1α did not significantly reduce the phosphorylation of VASP by cGMP. Taken together these data demonstrate the effectiveness of the δR1α to shut down the PKA system and suggest that at 250 μm 8-Br-cAMP or cGMP there is no cross-activation of PKA and PKG in these cells. The importance of PKG downstream of cGMP in that activation of p38 MAPK was further supported by the ability of this nucleotide to cause p38 MAPK phosphorylation in cells transfected to express δR1α with almost identical kinetics to cells with a functional PKA system (Fig. 3 B). The type 1 isoforms of PKG are more widely distributed than type 2 and are the enzymes found in immune cells (32.Lohmann S.M. Vaandrager A.B. Smolenski A. Walter U. De Jonge H.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 307-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To test the importance of PKG in the activation of p38 MAPK by NO, PKG1α was cloned, and a catalytically inactive mutant construct of this enzyme was generated for use in the 293T cell transfection system. The T516A mutation has been previously characterized and shown to prevent the phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue located in the catalytic region of the enzyme, a process thought to be essential for the catalytic function of this enzyme (33.Feil R. Kellermann J. Hofmann F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13152-13158Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Low levels of PKG activity were measured in untransfected or mock-transfected 293T cells using a peptide substrate based assay (Fig. 4). Transfection of the cells with either wild-type or the T516A mutant construct resulted in overexpression of the protein which was detected as an intense band migrating at 80-kDa on Western blots probed with a polyclonal anti-PKG antibody (Fig. 4, inset). PKG activity in cell homogenates was not significantly altered by transfection of the T516A mutant confirming the absence of catalytic function. In homogenates transfected with the wild-type PKG1α, the activity was approximately 10-fold higher than in mock-transfected cells and the ratio of basal to cGMP stimulated activity was identical. The importance of PKG in cGMP-mediated stimulation of phospho-p38 was assessed by cotransfecting the wild-type and T516A mutant isoforms of PKG1α with the FLAG epitope-tagged p38 MAPK followed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. In these experiments overexpression of the catalytic mutant blocked the ability of 8-Br-cGMP to increase p38 phosphorylation (Fig.5). Furthermore, the increased levels of phospho-p38 that were found in 8-Br-cGMP-stimulated cells was further elevated in cells transfected to overexpress PKG1α. The ability of the wild-type PKG construct to enhance cGMP-stimulated p38 MAPK activation was variable and probably depends on the abundance of endogenous PKG, which was also appeared to vary with culture age (not shown). Other than the cyclic nucleotide specificity, a major difference between PKA and PKG is that distinct PKA genes encode the regulatory and catalytic subunits whereas they are present as separate domains in a single polypeptide in PKG. Expression of the catalytic region of type 1 PKG produces a constitutive activity that is insensitive to cGMP (31.Collins S.P. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8391-8404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, the truncated PKG was able to stimulate p38 MAPK phosphorylation in the absence of cGMP stimulation (Fig. 6). Of interest, the constitutive PKG produced lower levels of p38 MAPK phosphorylation than overexpressed ASK-1, which is known to directly activate MEK3 in the p38 pathway.Figure 5Involvement of PKG in cGMP-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. The effect of transfecting 293T fibroblasts to express wild-type or mutant PKG1α (T516A) on cGMP stimulated p38 phosphorylation was determined. Cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of FLAG-p38, and either 0.1 or 1 μg of PKG construct and 24 h later were stimulated with 250 μm8-Br-cGMP for 5 min. The cell homogenates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 and the precipitates analyzed for phospho-p38 content by Western blotting (top panel). The level of phospho-p38 found in unstimulated cells is shown as “Basal.” Equal loading of the lanes is shown by probing the immunoprecipitates with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (middle panel). The expression of PKG1α in the transfected cells was determined by measuring PKG protein in the cell homogenates by Western blotting with anti-PKG serum (lower panel) (A). The phosphorylation of p38 MAPK detected by Western blot analysis was quantitated by densitometry and standardized with the intensity of FLAG-p38 in the precipitates (B). The data shown were reproduced in at least two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Activation of p38 MAPK by constitutively active PKG. The ability of PKG kinase activity to cause p38 MAPK activation was examined by overexpressing a truncated version of PKG containing the catalytic region (δPKGc). After 24 h cells were harvested and the phospho-38 levels measured by Western blotting. The effectiveness of the δPKGc to activate p38 MAPK was compared with cells transfected to express ASK1 (as indicated). The expression of the truncated PKG was determined by Western blot analysis of cell extracts using an anti-COOH terminus PKG antibody (lower panel). The result shown is representative of at least two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because of its pleiotropic effects, there exists a possibility that NO might activate p38 MAPK by more than one means. To address this issue the effect of overexpression of PKG1α(T516A) on p38 MAPK activation by NO treatment was measured by both Western blotting and by ATF-2-dependent luciferase activity. The 293T cells stimulated with 100 μm SNP-1 for 30 min showed a high phospho-p38 level. Cotransfecting the cells with increasing amounts of the catalytically inactive PKG (T516A) dose-dependently inhibited NO stimulated p38 phosphorylation (Fig.7 A). At 1 μg of DNA/plate the amount of phospho-p38 in the SNP-1-stimulated cells was reduced to basal levels. Similarly, the activation of ATF-2-dependent luciferase activity stimulated by SNP-1 was completely inhibited by expression of the catalytic mutant of PKG1α (Fig. 7 B). Nitric oxide synthesis is induced by stimulation with a variety of different ligands although the function of this in most systems is poorly defined. Synthesis of nitric oxide contributes to vascular-endothelial growth factor stimulation of cell proliferation by activating the ERK pathway (17.Parenti A. Morbidelli L. Cui X.L. Douglas J.G. Hood J.D. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4220-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 28.Hood J. Granger H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23504-23508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we demonstrated a role for NO in LPS stimulated p38 MAPK phosphorylation, a process that requires cGMP accumulation (15.Browning D.D. Windes N.D. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 537-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Results shown here demonstrate that NO can activate p38 MAPK in 293T fibroblasts, suggesting that NO induced p38 MAPK activation is not confined to certain differentiated cell types but is a widespread phenomenon. The induction of ATF-2-dependent gene expression by either NO or 8-Br-cGMP lends further support to the physiological significance of this pathway. As a first step toward understanding the mechanism underlying cGMP-induced activation of p38 MAPK, the current study evaluated the role of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). Whereas much attention has focused upon PKA as a cyclic nucleotide responsive protein kinase, the function of PKG and how this protein might mediate the effects of NO on cell behavior have not been fully elucidated. Results shown here reveal that blockade of the PKA system does not affect activation of p38 MAPK by cGMP and that the levels of cGMP causing phosphorylation of p38 MAPK do not lead to PKA activation. Together these data indicate that as in other systems, PKG is the likely downstream effector of NO in the pathway leading to activation of p38 MAPK. PKG has three isoforms: PKG1α, PKG1β (products of alternative splicing), and PKG2. These enzymes differ predominantly in the amino-terminal regulatory region and in the intracellular and tissue distribution patterns (2.Pfeifer A. Klatt P. Massberg S. Ny L. Sausbier M. Hirneiss C. Wang G.X. Korth M. Aszodi A. Andersson K.E. Krombach F. Mayerhofer A. Ruth P. Fassler R. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 34.Lincoln T.M. Komalavilas P. Boerth N.J. MacMillan-Crow L.A. Cornwell T.L. Adv. Pharmacol. 1995; 34: 305-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Overexpression of wild-type PKG1α potentiated the activation of p38 MAPK by cGMP, and expression of the constitutive catalytic domain of PKG1 conferred increased levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK in the absence of exogenous cGMP. These data demonstrate that PKG is capable of activating p38 MAPK in these cells. Exogenous expression of catalytically inactive mutants of many kinases has been very useful in establishing specific functions for these proteins as the mutants often behave in a dominant negative fashion. The T516A mutant of PKG has been reported previously to be catalytically inactive in vitro when purified from baculovirus infected SF9 insect cells (33.Feil R. Kellermann J. Hofmann F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13152-13158Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here we show that transfection of this mutant into 293T cells does not confer kinase activity confirming indeed that this mutant has lost kinase activity. Furthermore, our results provide direct evidence for a dominant negative function of this mutant PKG, as it possesses the ability to block cGMP and NO stimulated activation of p38 MAPK. In cells stimulated with exogenous NO, blockade of both p38 phosphorylation and ATF-2 dependent gene expression with the T516A mutant suggests that PKG activation is essential to this pathway and that other mechanisms such as protein nitrosylation are less important. Thus, this mutant PKG will complement the use of the inhibitor KT5823 in studies of PKG where inhibition of its function is required. The mechanism for the dominant negative action of this mutant PKG is currently not known, nor is its effect on other PKG isotypes. Many protein kinases localize to specific regions of the cell by interacting with specific anchoring proteins, and this interaction is essential for enzyme function (35.Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Because such proteins exist for PKG (36.Vo N.K. Gettemy J.M. Coghlan V.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), it is possible that at higher levels of expression the mutant PKG might displace the endogenous enzyme from its anchoring proteins. Further characterization of its mode of action may provide useful information for future application of this dominant negative kinase. It is well established that p38 MAPK can be activated by a large number of environmental factors, and all of them do not activate the same signaling mechanism. Although significant compared with the basal level, the degree of p38 MAPK activation by exogenous NO or cGMP-elevating agents was weaker than that stimulated by TNFα. Similar results were obtained by overexpressing ASK-1 (downstream of TNFα), when compared with p38 MAPK phosphorylation in cells expressing constitutive PKG. The reason for the difference in potency of PKG-mediated versus TNFα induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation was not determined in these experiments. However, this point suggests that the underlying mechanism used by TNFα/ASK-1 to activate the p38 MAPK pathway is likely to be different from that initiated by cGMP/PKG. The finding that NO and 8-Br-cGMP were able to induce ATF-2 reporter activity to the same extent as TNFα demonstrates that the amount of MAPK activity induced by these agents is likely to be physiologically significant and that a certain minimal level of p38 MAPK activation is sufficient for this process. Activation of p38 MAPK leads to its translocation to the nucleus and activation of multiple transcription factors, including ATF-2 and MEF2C (37.Han J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The activation of both p38 MAPK and JNK are central to immediate early gene expression during the inflammatory response (24.Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 25.Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). The activation of p38 MAPK by PKG as demonstrated here indicates a possible role for this enzyme in transcriptional regulation. This notion is supported by the finding that NO synthesis in several systems can cause cGMP-dependent alterations in transcription, including activation of immediate early gene expression (3.Wang X. Robinson P.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 19.Sciorati C. Nistico G. Meldolesi J. Clementi E. Br. J.

There are widespread reports that demonstrate transcriptional up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase by cytokines, a process in which p38 MAPK activation is essential (39.Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Lee J.C. Hogan E.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Bhat A.N. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 41.Chan E.D. Winston B.W. Uh S.T. Wynes M.W. Rose D.M. Riches D.W. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15294-15300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The activation of p38 MAPK by PKG as demonstrated here would tend to amplify the cytokine response, perhaps by sustaining MAPK activation in an autoregulatory manner. The cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases have also been shown directly to mediate some gene expression, although emphasis has been on the ability to activate the transcription factor CREB by direct phosphorylation. These studies have lead to some debate as to how the cytosolically located PKG can activate the predominantly nuclear CREB as a substrate (31.Collins S.P. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8391-8404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 43.Gudi T. Huvar I. Meinecke M. Lohmann S.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5244-5254Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The activation of MAPKs by PKG can therefore provide an alternative mechanism by which PKG can regulate transcription without nuclear translocation. Although the underlying mechanism used by NO to activate the p38 MAPK pathway are not known, this study demonstrates that cGMP mediated activation of PKG is essential for this process. The biochemical sequence of events leading to activation of ERK can be initiated by diverse extracellular signals, but the pathway converges upon activation of few upstream components (e.g. RAS, Raf). The upstream components leading to activation of p38 MAPK are less defined and in contrast to the role of c-Raf in the ERK pathway, a convergence is not apparent as there are many MEK kinases capable of activating MEK3. The type 1 isoforms of PKG are widely expressed; however, the specific substrates for this enzyme remain poorly defined. Elucidation of the mechanism underlying p38 MAPK activation will require more study, but such efforts might concentrate upon the immediate substrates of this enzyme. We are grateful to Drs. Stanley McKnight, Michael Uhler, Jiahuai Han, and Tatyana. Voyno-Yasenetskaya for their generosity in providing the cDNA constructs used in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2000763279,"Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) homologous factors-1, -2, -3, and -4 (FHFs 1–4; also referred to as FGFs 11–14) comprise a separate branch of the FGF family and have been implicated in the development of the nervous system and limbs. We report here the characterization of multiple isoforms of FHF-1, -2, -3, and -4 which are generated through the use of alternative start sites of transcription and splicing of one or more of a series of alternative 5′-exons. Several isoforms show different subcellular distributions when expressed in transfected tissue culture cells, and the corresponding differentially spliced transcripts show distinct expression patterns in developing and adult mouse tissues. Together with the evolutionary conservation of the FHF isoforms among human, mouse, and chicken, these data indicate that alternative promoter use and differential splicing are important regulatory processes in controlling the activities of this subfamily of FGFs. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) homologous factors-1, -2, -3, and -4 (FHFs 1–4; also referred to as FGFs 11–14) comprise a separate branch of the FGF family and have been implicated in the development of the nervous system and limbs. We report here the characterization of multiple isoforms of FHF-1, -2, -3, and -4 which are generated through the use of alternative start sites of transcription and splicing of one or more of a series of alternative 5′-exons. Several isoforms show different subcellular distributions when expressed in transfected tissue culture cells, and the corresponding differentially spliced transcripts show distinct expression patterns in developing and adult mouse tissues.

Each FHF transcript or protein is indicated by a species designation consisting of a lower case letter preceding FHF (c, chicken human mouse) and a 5′-splice isoform designation consisting of “1” followed by a letter in parentheses after FHF. For example, mFHF-2 (1Y+1V) refers either to the mouse FHF-2 transcript carrying exons 1Y and 1V at its 5′-end or to the protein encoded by that transcript Members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF)1 family of signaling proteins play diverse roles in numerous developmental processes (for reviews, see Refs. 1.Gosporadowicz D. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1990; 24: 57-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 2.Martin G.R. Development. 1998; 12: 1571-1586Google Scholar, 3.Szebenyi G. Fallon J.F. Int. Rev. Cyt. 1999; 185: 36-45Google Scholar). Previously we described the identification of four novel FGFs, referred to as fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHF-1, -2, -3, and -4; now equivalently called FGF-12, -13, -11, and -14, respectively) which are prominently expressed in the nervous system in mice and chickens (4.Smallwood P.M. Munoz-Sanjuan I. Tong P. Macke J.P. Hendry S.H.C. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The FHFs form a distinct branch of the FGF family and show 30–50% amino acid sequence identity with other FGFs. Within the FHF subfamily, different members share 60–70% identity. We and others have reported the identification of several alternatively spliced FHF transcripts in mice and chickens which code for FHF proteins with distinct amino termini (5.Munoz-Sanjuan I. Simandl B.K. Fallon J.F. Nathans J. Development. 1999; 126: 409-421PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Hartung H. Feldman B. Lovec H. Coulier F. Birnbaum D. Goldfarb M. Mech.

Acta. 1998; 1398: 38-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In chicken embryos the two previously identified FHF-2 transcripts have distinct and nonoverlapping spatial distributions, suggesting that the encoded proteins may have distinct roles during development (5.Munoz-Sanjuan I. Simandl B.K. Fallon J.F. Nathans J. Development. 1999; 126: 409-421PubMed Google Scholar). To explore the extent to which the diversity and expression of the FHFs are regulated by differential promoter use and/or splicing of 5′-exons, we searched for novel FHF transcripts that differ at their 5′-ends. This paper reports the identification and characterization of a large variety of FHF isoforms that are conserved among human, mouse, and chicken. These isoforms (three in the FHF-1 gene, nine in the FHF-2 gene, and two each in the FHF-3 and FHF-4 genes) code for proteins with highly divergent amino termini. When expressed in cultured cells, several of the isoforms have different subcellular distributions. Analysis of the expression of the differentially spliced coding exons of each of the FHFs by RNase protection and in situhybridization in the developing and adult mouse shows that many isoforms have distinctive patterns of expression. Taken together, these observations imply that alternative promoter use and alternative splicing of 5′-exons are important for the regulation of FHF gene expression and for the generation of FHF proteins with distinct biochemical properties. Double-stranded e15 mouse embryo cDNA (CLONTECH) was used as template for 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE; 8). Two sequential PCRs were performed with two pairs of nested adaptor primers and gene-specific primers located in exon 2, and the resulting PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, cloned into pBS-KS or λgt10, and sequenced. An e10 chicken brain cDNA library (a gift of Dr. M. Tessier-Lavigne) was screened with probes derived from: (a) the alternatively spliced isoforms obtained in the mFHF-2 5′-RACE PCR; (b) exon 1S of hFHF-2; and (c) exons 2–5 of mFHF-4. A chicken e6 retina cDNA library (a gift of Dr. L. Gan) and a chicken stage 21–22 limb cDNA library (a gift of Dr. J. F. Fallon) were screened with probes derived from exons 2–5 of mFHF-1. These screens yielded cDNAs encoding the complete coding regions of cFHF-1(1B), cFHF-2(1Q+1Y′), cFHF-2(1Q+1Y′+1V), and cFHF-4(1B), and a cDNA encoding cFHF-4(1A) lacking the first 10 codons. Filters were hybridized in 30–40% formamide, 5 × SSC at 42 °C, and washed in 2 × SSC at 50 °C-55 °C. The chicken FHF-2(1U) isoform was amplified by degenerate PCR using chicken genomic DNA as template and the following primers (containingBamHI and EcoRI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends): 5′-GCTCATGGATCCAGTA(C/T)G(A/G)GCTTGATGTTTCTGGCC-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-GCTCATGAATTCCTGAATA(C/T)GACTTCCTTAACAAAGCC-3′ (antisense primer). PCR conditions were as follows: (1×) 94 °C, 7 min; (10×) 94 °C, 30 s; 95 °C, 15 s; 45 °C, 2 min; 72 °C, 30 s; (20×) 94 °C, 1 min; 55 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min; (1×) 72 °C, 10 min. The PCR product was digested and subcloned into pBS-KS (Stratagene) and sequenced. Rabbit polyclonal anti-FHF-2 antibodies were raised against a bacterial fusion protein consisting of the entire FHF-2 open reading frame fused to the T7 gene 10 protein (9.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 185: 60-89Crossref Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). Anti-FHF-2 antibodies were affinity purified using the fusion protein immobilized onto nitrocellulose; those antibodies directed against the fusion partner were removed by absorption to immobilized T7 gene 10 protein. By Western blotting and by staining of transfected cells, the antibodies purified in this fashion did not cross-react with FHF-1 or FHF-4 proteins. Anti-FHF-1 antibodies are described in Ref. 4.Smallwood P.M. Munoz-Sanjuan I. Tong P. Macke J.P. Hendry S.H.C. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9850-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar. cDNA segments encoding FHF-2(1S), FHF-2(1U), FHF-2(1V), FHF-2(1Y), and FHF-2(1Y+1V) were subcloned into the pCIS vector (10.Gorman C.M. Gies D.R. McCray G. DNA Prot. Eng. Tech. 1990; 2: 3-10Google Scholar) for eukaryotic expression. To increase the efficiency of translation, the region immediately upstream of the putative initiator methionine was converted to an optimal ribosome binding site (CCACCATG) by PCR mutagenesis. The transfected cDNAs encode FHF-2 isoforms from the following species: FHF-2(1Y+1V), chicken; FHF-2(1Y), mouse; FHF-2(1V), mouse; FHF-2(1S), human; FHF-2(1U), human. Exons 2–5 of human and mouse FHF-2 encode protein sequences that differ by a single amino acid substitution; the corresponding human and chicken sequences differ by five amino acid substitutions. Expression in transiently transfected 293 cells was assessed by Western blotting with anti-hFHF-2 polyclonal antibodies. Transient transfection and immunostaining were performed as described in Ref. 4.Smallwood P.M. Munoz-Sanjuan I. Tong P. Macke J.P. Hendry S.H.C. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9850-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar. The two isoforms of FHF-4, FHF-4(1A) and FHF-4(1B), were subcloned into pCIS, with an optimal ribosome binding site at the initiator codon, and tagged at the COOH terminus with a myc tag (11.Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). The FHF-4(1A) isoform was from mouse, and the 1B isoform was from chicken. Exons 2–5 of mouse and chicken FHF-4 differ by 11 amino acid substitutions. These proteins were produced in transiently transfected COS and 293 cells, and their expression levels assayed with anti-myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (11.Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). 20-μm frozen sections were cut from e12.5 embryos, e18.5 embryos, and adult mouse brains and hybridized with probes derived from exons 2–5 of mFHF-1, mFHF-2, mFHF-3, and mFHF-4. The sections were also hybridized with probes derived from the following alternate mouse exons: mFHF-1, exon 1A; mFHF-2, exons 1S, 1Y, 1V, and 1U; mFHF-3, exons 1A and 1B; mFHF-4, exons 1A and 1B. 33P-Labeled probes were prepared byin vitro transcription of PCR-amplified templates containing the T3 promoter in the antisense primer. In situhybridization was performed essentially as described in Ref. 4.Smallwood P.M. Munoz-Sanjuan I. Tong P. Macke J.P. Hendry S.H.C. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9850-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, with the addition of 10 mm Na-EDTA to all buffers. Autoradiographic images and cresyl violet-stained tissue sections were scanned, and the images were merged and manipulated using Photoshop 5.0 software for the Macintosh. RNase protection experiments were carried out using an Ambion RPA II kit following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, individual mFHF exons were subcloned into pBS-KS and transcribed in vitro using T3 or T7 polymerases with an Ambion Maxiscript kit. 4 × 105 cpm of32P-labeled probes was used per reaction with 10 μg of total RNA isolated from the following adult mouse tissues: brain, eye, heart, liver, lung, kidney, spleen, and testis. 10 μg of yeast tRNA was used as a control. We and others (5.Munoz-Sanjuan I. Simandl B.K. Fallon J.F. Nathans J. Development. 1999; 126: 409-421PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Hartung H. Feldman B. Lovec H. Coulier F. Birnbaum D. Goldfarb M. Mech.

Acta. 1998; 1398: 38-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have reported the identification of several isoforms of FHF-1, FHF-2, and FHF-4 in which distinct amino termini are generated by differential splicing. Our initial characterization of transcripts encoding the cFHF-2(1Y+1V) and cFHF-2(1S) isoforms in chicken embryos showed that they are expressed differentially in the developing neural tube (5.Munoz-Sanjuan I. Simandl B.K. Fallon J.F. Nathans J. Development. 1999; 126: 409-421PubMed Google Scholar). Differential expression of two mFHF-4 splice isoforms was reported in the adult rat brain (7.Yamamoto S. Mikami T. Ohbayashi N. Ohta M. Itoh N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 38-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These observations, together with the high degree of conservation of the two alternate FHF-2 exons between humans and chickens, suggested that alternative splicing of the FHFs may be a general and conserved mechanism for regulating FHF gene expression. To investigate whether there are other splice isoforms of the FHFs with divergent amino termini, we screened cDNA libraries from mouse and chicken embryos, brain, and retina and performed 5′-RACE with e15 mouse embryo RNA. We also examined human brain and retina cDNA clones from earlier screens for evidence of alternative splicing. This search identified three isoforms of FHF-1, nine isoforms of FHF-2, and two isoforms each of FHF-3 and FHF-4 (TableI). Results from 5′-RACE suggest that in the mouse embryo, FHF-2 and FHF-3 display the largest number of distinct transcripts. In contrast, FHF-1 and FHF-4 5′-RACE reactions with mouse embryo RNA revealed only a single product in each case, and these were identified as the mFHF-1(1A) and mFHF-4(1B) isoforms. Thus far, one novel mFHF-3 isoform has been identified from the 5′-RACE reaction, mFHF-3(1B).Table IDifferentially spliced FHF exons identified in human, mouse, or chicken cDNAGene5′-exonsSpeciesSourceFHF-11AHumanSmallwoodet al.

One cFHF-1 cDNA clone isolated from a chicken limb cDNA library (isoform 1D; Table I) does not appear to encode a functional open reading frame unless translation is initiated from a non-AUG codon, as is the case for some FGFs (12.Bugler B.

The existence of this isoform was verified independently by reverse transcriptase PCR from stage 23–24 chicken embryo RNA. FHF-2 shows the greatest diversity of spliced isoforms, with nine different transcripts identified in various species (Table I). The majority of the FHF-2 transcripts were identified either from mouse or chicken cDNAs, but most of the alternate exons also have counterparts in human genomic DNA. All of the homologous human sequences are present at the FHF-2 locus 5′ of the invariant exons (exons 2–5) and in the same orientation as those exons. For example, exon 1U was identified initially as part of a mouse 5′-RACE product and was found subsequently in the chicken genome by PCR, in human genomic DNA sequences from the FHF-2 locus, and in an expressed sequence tag from developing human fetal heart. One cDNA segment from the mouse 5′-RACE analysis, exon 1R, is highly homologous to a small segment of human genomic DNA between exons 1S and 2 of the human FHF-2 gene. Although this exon has not been found in any human cDNA, its location within the human FHF-2 gene suggests that it forms a part of that gene. All of the alternate 5′-exons that contain coding sequences (1S, 1U, 1V, and 1Y) have been identified in human, mouse, and chicken and are highly conserved (Table II).Table IIFHF isoforms generated by 5′ alternative splicingExonsSequenceSpeciesSubcellular localizationFHF-11AMAAAIASSLIROKROARESNSDRVSASKRRSSPSKDGRSLCERHVLGVFSKVRFCSGRKRPVRRRP/EPQL …HumanNuclear––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––/EPQL …MouseAbsent in nucleoli––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––/EPQL …Chicken 1BMESK/EPQL …HumanCytosolic + nuclear––––/EPQL …Mouse––G–/EPQL …ChickenFHF-21SMAAAIASSLIRQKRQAREREKSNACKCVSSPSKGKTSCDKNKLNVFSRVKLFGSKKRRRRRP/EPQL …HumanNuclear + nucleoli––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––/EPQL …Mouse––––––––––––––––––––––––––––N––––S–G––––––––––––––––––––––––––/EPQL …Chicken 1UMALLRKSYS/EPQL …HumanCytosolic + nuclear–––––––––/EPQL …Mouse–––––––––/EPQL …Chicken 1VMSGKVTKPKEEKDASK/EPQL …HumanCytosolic + nuclear––––––––––––––––/EPQL …Mouse–––––I––––––––––/EPQL …Chicken 1YMLRQDSIQSAELKKKESPFRAKCHEIFCCPLKQVHHKENTEPE/EPQL …HumanCytosolic + nuclear––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––P––––––––––––/EPQL …MouseMDDAPPGTQEYI–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––L–––––––/EPQL …Chicken 1Y + 1VMSGKVTKPKEEKDASK/VLDDAPPGTQEYIMLRQDSIQSAELKKKESPFRAKCHEIFCCOLKQVHHKENTEPE/EPQL …Human––––––––––––––––/–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––P––––––––––––/EPQL …MouseCytosolic + nuclear–––––I––––––––––/–M––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––L–––––––/EPQL …ChickenFHF-31AMAALASSLIRQKREVREPGGSRPVSAQRRVCPRGTKSLCQKQLLILLSKVRLCGGRPARPDRGP/EPQL …HumanND–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––T–Q––––/EPQL …Mouse 1BMSLS/EPQL …MouseNDFHF-41AMAAAIASGLIRQKRQAREQHWDRPSASRRRSSPSKNRGLCNGNLVDIFSKVRIFGLKKRRLRRQ/DPQL …HumanNuclear–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––F–––––––––––––––––––––––/DPQL …MouseAbsent in nucleoli–––––––––––––––––––N––––––––C–––––––––––––––––––––––/DPQL …Chicken 1BMVKPVPLFRRTDFKLLLCNHKGLFFLRVSKLLGCFSPKSMWFLWNIFSKGTHMLQCLCGKSLKKNKNPT/DPQL …MouseCytosolic–I–––––––––GLN–––––R–D––––––Y–––D–––––––––––––––––S––––––––––––––––Q–/DPQL …ChickenAmino acid sequences of the alternative amino termini for the various FHF isoforms derived from human, mouse, and chicken.

Fig. 1 shows the complex structures of the differentially spliced 5′-ends of the FHF-2 transcripts. In several cases, the 5′-coding exons are spliced together with different noncoding exons. Within exons 1Y and 1S, some splicing events retain only the 3′-regions of these exons (termed 1Y′ and 1S′, respectively) as parts of longer transcripts. Several of the FHF-2 5′-exons reported here are noncoding because there are stop codons in all three reading frames (exons 1P, 1Q, 1T, 1W, 1X, and 1Z). Most of the putative 5′-coding exons contain only one potential initiator methionine codon, and, except for exon 1U, the sequence around that methionine is not a close match to the optimal consensus for the initiation of translation (15.Kozak M.

In one instance (exon 1V) there is a potential initiator methionine codon in chicken cDNA which is absent from the human and mouse cDNAs (AUG in chicken versus CUG in mouse and human; see Table II). In this regard, it may be relevant that some FGF-2 and FGF-3 translation products are initiated at CUG codons (12.Bugler B. Amalric F. Prats H. Mol. Cell.

Identification of homologous spliced isoforms in the chicken and mouse FHF-2 genes suggests that the alternative 5′-exons have been conserved through evolution. The human FHF-2 gene maps to Xq26 (4.Smallwood P.M. Munoz-Sanjuan I. Tong P. Macke J.P. Hendry S.H.C. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9850-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), and this region has been sequenced extensively, allowing the unambiguous identification of human counterparts for most of the exons identified in other species. Fig.2 shows the current map of the hFHF-2 gene which encompasses at least 400 kilobases of genomic DNA. Many of the alternate 5′-exons cluster within the gene, and several predicted introns are more than 100 kilobases in length. Noncoding 5′-exons 1T and 1Q have not yet been identified in humans. The nucleotide sequences of both coding and noncoding exons are highly conserved across species. For example, 5′-untranslated regions within the noncoding portions of the alternative coding exons share >90% nucleotide sequence identity between human and chicken. In earlier work, we identified a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in FHF-1 (now FHF-1(1A)), which is sufficient to confer nuclear localization in a variety of tissue culture cell lines (4.Smallwood P.M. Munoz-Sanjuan I. Tong P. Macke J.P. Hendry S.H.C. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9850-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The NLS sequence is conserved among those isoforms of FHF-2, -3, and -4 which most closely resemble FHF-1(1A), and is absent from several isoforms of FHF-1, -2, -3, and -4 which differ in their amino-terminal sequences (Table II). To analyze the subcellular distribution of the different FHFs and their various isoforms, chicken, mouse, and human FHFs were produced in transiently transfected 293, COS, and QT6 cells. Similar results were obtained with the different cell lines. As expected, FHF-2(1S), the isoform most similar to FHF-1(1A), localizes to the nucleus in transfected cells (Fig. 3 A). The FHF-2 isoforms beginning with exons 1U, 1V, 1Y, or (1Y+1V) lack a consensus NLS, and the encoded proteins show a diffuse cytosolic and nuclear distribution when transiently transfected into 293 or QT6 cells (Fig. 3 B; Table II). Double immunofluorescence staining of these FHF-2 isoforms and BiP, an ER-resident protein, reveals that they are not localized to the ER (Fig. 3 B). Their localization in the nucleoplasm may reflect passive diffusion of the FHFs through nuclear pores. In contrast, a myc-tagged version of cFHF-4(1B) is localized exclusively in the cytosol in COS and 293 cells (Fig. 3,D and E), whereas mFHF-4(1A), which has a consensus NLS, shows nuclear localization, although it is excluded from the nucleoli (Fig. 3 C). Hydropathy analysis of the FHF-4(1B) splice variant shows a hydrophobic stretch in the first 25 residues of this isoform which could act as an ER-targeting signal sequence, the only such sequence identified thus far among the FHFs. However, we have been unable to detect significant quantities of myc-tagged FHF-4(1B) or of any other FHF in conditioned media from transfected cells. The FHF-2(1S), FHF-2(1V), and FHF-2(1Y+1V) isoforms were tagged at their carboxyl termini with six histidines and purified from 293 cell lysates by affinity chromatography using nickel resin and heparin agarose. The FHF-2(1S) isoform binds heparin more tightly than the other two isoforms, eluting at 0.7 m NaCl rather than at 0.4 m NaCl as seen for FHF-2(1V) and FHF-2(1Y+1V). This observation suggests that different FHF isoforms may differ in their interac"
https://openalex.org/W1998866496,"The insulin-responsive aminopeptidase (IRAP/VP165/gp160) was identified originally in GLUT4-containing vesicles and shown to translocate in response to insulin, much like the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4). This study characterizes the trafficking and kinetics of IRAP in exocytosis, endocytosis, and recycling to the membrane in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. After exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to insulin, IRAP translocated to the plasma membrane as assessed by either cell fractionation, surface biotinylation, or the plasma membrane sheet assay. The rate of exocytosis closely paralleled that of GLUT4. In the continuous presence of insulin, IRAP was endocytosed with a half-time of about 3–5 min. IRAP endocytosis is inhibited by cytosol acidification, a property of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, but not by the expression of a constitutively active Akt/PKB. Arrival in an LDM fraction derived via subcellular fractionation exhibited a slower time course than disappearance from the cell surface, suggesting additional endocytic intermediates. As assayed by membrane “sheets,” GLUT4 and IRAP showed similar internalization rates that are wortmannin-insensitive and occur with a half-time of roughly 5 min. IRAP remaining on the cell surface 10 min following insulin removal was both biotin- and avidin-accessible, implying the absence of thin-necked invaginations. Finally, endocytosed IRAP quickly recycled back to the plasma membrane in a wortmannin-sensitive process. These results demonstrate rapid endocytosis and recycling of IRAP in the presence of insulin and trafficking that matches GLUT4 in rate.

Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is mediated primarily by the rapid movement of the fat/muscle-specific glucose transporter (GLUT)1 4 from a latent intracellular compartment to the cell surface (1.Birnbaum M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The subcellular trafficking of GLUT4 has been studied using an impermeant photolabel specific for the extracellular sugar-binding site of the transporter (2.Satoh S. Nishimura H. Clark A.E. Kozka I.J. Vannucci S.J. Simpson I.A. Quon M.J. Cushman S.W. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17820-17829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M.

These studies demonstrated that in the presence of insulin there was constant recycling of GLUT4 between the intracellular compartment and the plasma membrane, although the total amount of GLUT4 in the plasma membrane was elevated and constant. There are data supporting the existence of exocytotic intermediates in which GLUT4 might be present in the membrane but inaccessible to substrate (2.Satoh S. Nishimura H. Clark A.E. Kozka I.J. Vannucci S.J. Simpson I.A. Quon M.J. Cushman S.W. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17820-17829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, a recent report studying GLUT4 in CHO cells demonstrated endocytotic intermediates similar to those described for a synaptic vesicle protein, synaptophysin (5.Wei M.L. Bonzelius F. Scully R.M. Kelly R.B. Herman G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 6.Schmidt A. Hannah M.J. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Recently, the insulin-responsive aminopeptidase (IRAP) has been cloned, shown to reside in the GLUT4-containing basal compartment, and also translocate to the plasma membrane after insulin stimulation (7.Keller S.R. Scott H.M. Mastick C.C. Aebersold R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23612-23618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 8.Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8017-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The physiological function of IRAP has been hypothesized to be hormonal modulation of circulating vasoactive peptides such as vasopressin (9.Rogi T. Tsujimoto M. Nakazato H. Mizutani S. Tomoda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 56-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar,10.Herbst J.J. Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Bobin S.A. Morris N.J. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E600-E606PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, determining the normal function of IRAP might be critical in defining the mechanism of diabetic complications such as hypertension or peripheral vascular disease that might result from impaired translocation of IRAP. Therefore, investigating the normal trafficking and biology of IRAP is critical not only to illuminate insulin-stimulated trafficking but as a first step in eventually defining pathologies in conditions such as diabetes. The purpose of this study was to describe the trafficking and kinetics of IRAP in the context of GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Several studies have shown overlapping subcellular distribution of GLUT4 by light microscopy (11.Martin S. Rice J.E. Gould G.W. Keller S.R. Slot J.W. James D.E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2281-2291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Malide D. St-Denis J.F. Keller S.R. Cushman S.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and subcellular fraction (13.Sumitani S. Ramlal T. Somwar R. Keller S.R. Klip A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3328-3332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Whereas the steady state location of IRAP is overlapping with GLUT4, its trafficking has not been described in detail. One report suggests that IRAP and GLUT4 traffic differently in response to high glucose or glucosamine (15.Filippis A. Clark S. Proietto J. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Another demonstrates IRAP exclusion from cardiac secretory granules containing atrial natriuretic factor and GLUT4 (11.Martin S. Rice J.E. Gould G.W. Keller S.R. Slot J.W. James D.E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2281-2291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a third report studying rat fat demonstrates that IRAP does not internalize in the presence of insulin (16.Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25210-25217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); this is in marked contrast to the constitutive recycling of GLUT4. In an effort to define the trafficking and kinetics of IRAP movement, we have adapted protocols using biotinylation to develop assays measuring endocytosis and recycling of IRAP back to the cell surface. Additionally, we employed the plasma membrane sheet protocol to compare directly IRAP and GLUT4 levels on the cell surface. By using these techniques we find IRAP is endocytosed rapidly both in the presence and absence of insulin. Moreover, IRAP is endocytosed and exocytosed with rates similar to GLUT4. These techniques have also allowed us to study other details of IRAP as follows: its endocytosis is inhibited by cytosolic acidification, a property of clathrin mediated endocytosis, but not by a constitutively active Akt/PKB. Endocytic intermediates likely occur between exiting the plasma membrane and arrival in the LDM. Finally, we can directly demonstrate endocytosed IRAP rapidly recycles to the plasma membrane in the presence of insulin. Crystalline porcine insulin was a gift of Lilly. Polyclonal antibodies against IRAP cytoplasmic amino terminus were kindly donated by Metabolex, Inc. (Hayward, CA). Polyclonal sheep anti-GLUT4 antibodies were raised against a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein encoding the last 31 amino acids of the GLUT4 carboxyl terminus. Monoclonal mouse anti-IRAP were raised against the 110 amino acids of the IRAP amino terminus. Affinity purified/subtracted rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-sheep and affinity purified/subtracted fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, Pa). Bovine serum albumin used in translocation assays was from Calbiochem. Wortmannin was purchased from Sigma and stored as a 10 mm stock in Me2SO. 125I-Protein A was purchased from ICN Radiochemicals (Irvine, CA). A bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit for the determination of protein concentrations was from Pierce as were 2,2′-azine-di[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate], streptavidin-HRP, neutravidin-HRP, sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin, and sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin. Unless otherwise noted, all other chemicals were from Sigma. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 7.5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum (Life Technologies Inc.). Cells were plated onto either 18-mm square number 1 coverslips, 6-well or 10-cm plates, and differentiated 2 days postconfluence with dexamethasone (0.4 mg/ml), 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (0.5 mm), and 10% fetal bovine serum as described (17.Garcia de Herreros A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19994-19999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but without supplemental insulin and including 25 μmtroglitazone. Adipocytes were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, fed every 7 days, and used at approximately 10–30 days postdifferentiation. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts expressing both a myristoylated, constitutively active form of the serine/threonine kinase Akt (myr-Akt-(D4–129)) and an empty vector control (neo) were generously provided by Richard Roth, Stanford University, Stanford, CA. The constitutively active myr-Akt construct includes an amino-terminal myristoylation sequence rendering the molecule constitutively active. The pleckstrin homology domain, amino acids 4–129, was removed. The effects on glucose uptake of stable expression of these constructs into 3T3-L1s was described previously (18.Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). The presence of IRAP on the cell surface was determined using an IRAP biotinylation assay similar to that described previously (19.Summers S.A. Garza L.A. Zhou H. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5457-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocytes in 6-well dishes were washed twice in PBS, once in Leibovitz-15 media with 0.2% BSA, and left in that media for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were treated with 20 nm insulin for 20 min. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold KRPH (128 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mmCaCl2, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 5 mm NaPO4, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and treated with 1 ml of 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin in KRPH for 30 min. Each plate was then bathed three times for 10 min each in KRPH containing 20 mm glycine, twice with KRPH, and finally lysed in 1 ml of Solubilization Buffer (1% Triton, 150 mmNaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, pH 7.4). The lysate was vortexed briefly, incubated for 15 min, and centrifuged at 23,000 × g for 15 min. After passing the supernatants through a 45-μm filter (Millipore), BCA assay was performed to determine protein concentration. 600 μg of protein was diluted to 500 μl with Solubilization Buffer and reacted with polyclonal anti-IRAP sera overnight, followed by 3–6 h incubation in protein A-Sepharose. These conditions were shown to consistently remove greater than 90% of IRAP from the supernatant. SDS-gels of the boiled and reduced immunoadsorbates were transferred to PVDF+ membranes, blocked in TBS-T with 6% BSA, treated with 1 μg/ml of streptavidin-HRP for 2 h, washed in TBS-T, and developed using ECL+ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on a STORM 860 Scanner detecting chemifluorescence. The signal intensity of quantitated samples was shown to be within the linear range of detection. Cells were fractionated by standard techniques (2.Satoh S. Nishimura H. Clark A.E. Kozka I.J. Vannucci S.J. Simpson I.A. Quon M.J. Cushman S.W. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17820-17829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were resuspended in HES (255 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA), homogenized by passing through an EMBL Cell Cracker (clearance of 18 μm), and subjected to differential centrifugation. The supernatant from the following spins were serially removed and pelleted in a Ti70 rotor as follows: 19,000 ×g (20 min), 41,000 × g (20 min), and 180,000 × g (75 min). The first 19,000 ×g pellet was resuspended, loaded onto a sucrose cushion (1.12 m sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA), and isolated from the interface yielding the Plasma Membrane (PM) fraction as the pellet of a 41,000 ×g spin (20 min). The last 180,000 × gpellet corresponded to the Low Density Microsome (LDM) fraction. After resuspension of pellets in Solubilization Buffer, protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid protein assay, and 20 μg of each fraction was loaded for Western blotting. For immunoprecipitation, 100 μg of LDM and 50 μg of PM were solubilized in 1% Triton, passed through a 45 μm filter, and used for immunoprecipitation of IRAP as detailed above. For experiments measuring total cell IRAP in parallel, aliquots removed after passage through the Cell Cracker but before differential centrifugation were raised to 1% Triton and 100 mm NaCl and subjected to immunoprecipitation of IRAP as detailed above. To measure the presence of GLUT4 and IRAP on the cell surface, the plasma membrane sheet assay was used (20.Fingar D.C. Hausdorff S.F. Blenis J. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3005-3008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar) with modifications to allow quantitation of triple label. Plasma membrane “sheets” were prepared and processed for indirect immunofluorescence using affinity purified sheep antibodies to the carboxyl-terminal portion of GLUT4 and pooled ascites derived from three separate monoclonal hybridomas raised against the amino terminus of IRAP. Following primary incubation, membranes were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated anti-sheep secondary and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antisera. To stain for plasma membranes, 0.1 μg/μl phosphatidylethanolamine-biotin (Molecular Probes) and 0.1 μg/μl Marina-Blue Neutra-Lite Avidin (Molecular Probes) were included with primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. The images were acquired using a Princeton Instruments cooled CCD camera, and the amounts of GLUT4 and IRAP on the plasma membrane were quantitated by measuring the fluorescence intensity of at least seven fields. Digital image processing was performed as described previously except quantitated in 2 channels of florescence (21.Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar, 22.Hausdorff S.F. Frangioni J.V. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21931-21934Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). For washout experiments, insulin was removed using an acid wash technique (23.Gibbs E.M. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16597-16603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were quickly washed twice in KRPM (128 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mmCaCl2, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 5 mm NaPO4, 10 mm MES, pH 6.0), and returned to 37 °C in the same buffer. For wortmannin treatment, cells were treated with drug either prior to or after insulin stimulation. For the former, 500 nmwortmannin was added for the final 50 min, and insulin was added for the final 20 min of a 2-h incubation in serum-free media. For the latter, cells were stimulated with 20 nm insulin for 20 min, incubated with 500 nm wortmannin at 4 °C for 30 min, and warmed in the presence of 500 nm wortmannin for 10 min. IRAP endocytosis was measured by its protection from cleavage by a membrane-impermeable reagent based on published pulse-chase protocols (24.Bretscher M.S. Lutter R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4087-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25.Le Bivic A. Real F.X. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9313-9317Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with insulin, biotinylated, and glycine-treated as for Biotinylation Translocation Assay except for the substitution of sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin for sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin. After washing twice with KRPH, cells were raised to 37 °C by the addition of prewarmed Leibovitz-15 medium containing 0.2% BSA and 100 nm insulin and then floated on a water bath at a setting sufficient to maintain temperature. Following “chase” incubation periods of 0.5–20 min, cells were removed to an ice bath, and washed twice with KRPH at 4 °C. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were washed once and incubated for 15-min intervals in Cleavage Buffer (50 mm glutathione, 90 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl, 0.1 mm CaCl, 60 mm NaOH, 0.2% BSA, pH 8.6) for a total of 45 min. Subsequent to washing cells in KRPH three times, cells were solubilized and processed as for Biotinylation Translocation Assay using an anti-IRAP immunoprecipitation protocol with the omission of reducing agent in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Alternatively, cell lysates were incubated with streptavidin-agarose for 1 h and eluted with sample buffer containing reducing agent and developed as for Biotinylation Translocation Assay with the replacement of rabbit anti-IRAP and125I-protein A for streptavidin-HRP. Data are expressed either as “Cell Surface IRAP” or “Percent Escaping Cleavage.” The former is determined by first subtracting the value of biotinylation after immediate cleavage from all other values, dividing by total uncleaved signal, and subtracting from 1. The latter is determined by first subtracting the value of biotinylation after immediate cleavage from all other values and dividing by maximum protected signal. As described previously (26.Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Petersen O.W. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 27.Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), cells were exposed to a media containing acetic acid in order to acidify cytosol. After biotinylation and glycine treatment cells were washed twice in Leibovitz-15, pH 5.0 (HCl), washed twice in Leibovitz-15, pH 5.0 (acetic acid), and left in a third wash of Leibovitz-15, pH 5.0 (acetic acid), for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were exposed to identical media prewarmed to 37 °C, chilled at various times, and cleaved as described under Reversible Biotinylation Assay. The accessibility of biotin to avidin was performed as described (28.Carter L.L. Redelmeier T.E. Woollenweber L.A. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. All steps were performed at 4 °C. Following biotinylation and glycine treatment, cells were treated with avidin buffer (KRPH, 0.2% BSA, 250 μg/ml avidin) for 1 h, washed twice in KRPH, and incubated for 30 min in biocytin buffer (KRPH, 0.2% BSA, 250 μg/ml biocytin) to quench remaining available avidin sites. Cells were rinsed three times in KRPH and processed as in Biotinylation Assay for Translocation with the omission of boiling step before loading samples for SDS-PAGE to preclude disassembly of the avidin-biotin complexes. The recycling of IRAP back to the cell surface was monitored based on a published protocol examining recycling of antigen in B cells (29.Watts C. Davidson H.W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1937-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with insulin, biotinylated, glycine-treated, and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min as described for the IRAP Reversible Biotinylation Protocol with the substitution of LC-LC biotin for cleavable S-S biotin. Cells were then avidin-treated and biocytin-quenched as described above. Cells were warmed again to 37 °C for indicated times and returned to 4 °C by the addition of cooled KRPH. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Next, cells were treated with Neutravidin Buffer (KRPH, 0.2% BSA, 25 μg/ml neutravidin-HRP) for 1 h and quenched with biocytin a second time. Lysates were prepared, and IRAP was immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of protein as described above. 2,2′-Azine-di[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate] (ABTS) was added to immunoprecipitates, incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, pelleted, and the reaction product measured at A 405 nm. IRAP recently has been identified (8.Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8017-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), cloned (7.Keller S.R. Scott H.M.

In an attempt to characterize IRAP trafficking in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we measured insulin-stimulated translocation to the cell surface by three complimentary methods. The first was a quantitative biotinylation protocol adapted from published studies (8.Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8017-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 14.Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Morris N.J. Liung W.-Y. Mao F. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3328-3332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Insulin treatment induced a large increase in IRAP available at the cell surface for biotinylation (Fig. 1 A). We next applied techniques that are useful for measuring GLUT4 translocation as well as that of IRAP. After stimulating cells with insulin or maintaining them in a basal state, we homogenized cells and fractionated them into Plasma Membrane (PM), and Low Density Microsome (LDM) fractions (Fig. 1 B) (30.Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Insulin elicited a dramatic redistribution of IRAP from the LDM fraction to the PM fraction, similar to GLUT4 (31.Clancy B.M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12434-12443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, to compare directly trafficking of GLUT4 and IRAP in the same cells, we labeled membrane sheets for the presence of IRAP and GLUT4 (Fig. 1 C). Quantitation of images revealed a similar degree of translocation between the two proteins. These results demonstrating insulin-stimulated translocation of IRAP are consistent with previous reports (12.Malide D. St-Denis J.F. Keller S.R. Cushman S.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14.Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Morris N.J. Liung W.-Y. Mao F. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 138-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and serve to emphasize the parallel between IRAP and GLUT4 trafficking. A recent report demonstrated that IRAP does not endocytose in the presence of insulin in rat fat (16.Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25210-25217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To measure internalization in our cells, we adapted a reversible biotinylation technique to pulse-chase labeled IRAP into cells and determine the amount remaining on the surface by its susceptibility to a membrane-impermeable cleavage reagent. Cells were stimulated with insulin, biotinylated at 4 °C to label IRAP, and rewarmed in the presence of insulin for lengthening time. At the indicated time points, cells were chilled again and treated with an impermeant reducing agent, which cleaves the disulfide bond joining the biotin moiety with the protein-binding NHS ester. Thus, at time 0 most of the total label should be removed, and if internalization occurs, at later time points the biotin label should be protected. By using this method we indeed saw rapid and extensive internalization of IRAP (Fig.2, A and B). In Fig. 2 A, lysates were precipitated with avidin-agarose and submitted to Western blot analysis with antibodies against IRAP. In Fig. 2 B lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRAP antibodies, and the biotinylated IRAP was detected with streptavidin-HRP. Results were quantitated and expressed as cell surface IRAP. By using either method of detection, IRAP was found to be rapidly internalized in the presence of insulin with at 12 of approximately 3 min. To determine the kinetics of the entire population of IRAP, cells were biotinylated at 37 °C in the presence of insulin for increasing times, and afterward biotinylated material was precipitated from cell lysates with avidin-agarose as in Fig. 2 A. Precipitated material was then assayed for IRAP by Western blot analysis and compared with total cellular IRAP. Fig. 2 C demonstrates a time-dependent increase in IRAP biotinylation such that virtually all IRAP in the cell has translocated to the cell surface at least once by 1 h. Furthermore, since cell surface levels of IRAP are constant after 10 min of insulin stimulation (Fig. 5 A), these data indicate that intracellular stores of IRAP are constantly driven to the cell surface to replace the internalized IRAP demonstrated in Fig. 2, A and B. Cytosolic acidification has been shown to inhibit potently clathrin-mediated endocytosis by disruption of the clathrin lattice (33.Heuser J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Insulin-treated, biotinylated cells were warmed for 2 or 5 min in regular or cytosolic acidification media and then exposed to cleavage buffer (Fig. 3 A). For the final washout lane, cells were warmed for 5 min in acidification media, chilled, washed, and warmed for the final 15 min in pH 7.4 media. Cytosolic acidification prevented any sequestration from cleavage buffer, but its removal allowed biotinylated IRAP to endocytose and escape cleavage. These data support a role for clathrin in the endocytosis of IRAP. We next tested the mechanism of Akt-induced increases of plasma membrane IRAP. A constitutively active myristoylated Akt results in a large increase in IRAP and GLUT4 present at the plasma membrane (Fig.3 B, inset) (21.Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). To test whether Akt might be inhibiting endocytosis, cells expressing a constitutively active myr-Akt construct were compared with empty vector controls in a reversible biotinylation endocytosis assay as in Fig. 2 B. Both cells demonstrated similar rates indicating that inhibition of endocytosis does not account for the ability of myr-Akt to stimulate translocation of IRAP to the cell surface. Because of the likelihood that development of biotinylated IRAP's resistance to cleavage is a very early event in its endocytosis, the rate"

Here we report cloning of a T. brucei aconitase gene that is closely related to mammalian iron-regulatory protein 1 (IRP-1) and plant aconitases. Kinetic analysis of purified recombinant TbACO expressed inEscherichia coli resulted in a K m(isocitrate) of 3 ± 0.4 mm, similar to aconitases of other organisms. This was unexpected since an arginine conserved in the aconitase protein family and crucial for substrate positioning in the catalytic center and for activity of pig mitochondrial aconitase (Zheng, L., Kennedy, M.

Expression of the 98-kDa TbACO was shown to be lowest in the slender bloodstream stage of the parasite, 8-fold elevated in the stumpy stage, and increased a further 4-fold in the procyclic stage. The differential expression of TbACO protein contrasted with only minor changes in TbACO mRNA, indicating translational or post-translational mechanisms of regulation. Whereas animal cells express two distinct compartmentalized aconitases, mitochondrial aconitase and cytoplasmic aconitase/IRP-1, TbACO accounts for total aconitase activity in trypanosomes. By cell fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy, we show that native as well as a transfected epitope-tagged TbACO localizes in both the mitochondrion (30%) and in the cytoplasm (70%). Together with phylogenetic reconstructions of the aconitase family, this suggests that animal IRPs have evolved from a multicompartmentalized ancestral aconitase.

The flagellate is transmitted in subsaharan Africa between humans, livestock, and a huge reservoir of game animals by the tsetse fly, a bloodsucking insect vector. During cyclical transmission between mammals and tsetse, trypanosomes differentiate into a series of life cycle stages with distinct morphology, metabolism, and surface proteins to cope with the changing host environments and host defense mechanisms (1.Vickerman K. Br. Med. Bull. 1985; 41: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The proliferating forms in the host blood have elongated and slender appearance (long slender forms) and rely entirely on glycolysis for energy production (2.Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar, 3.Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 4.Clayton C.E. Michels P. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 465-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Inefficient substrate utilization seems affordable at that developmental stage, due to glucose homeostasis in host blood. Hence, slender forms lack significant amounts of Krebs cycle enzymes (5.Durieux P.O. Schütz P. Brun R. Köhler P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and their residual mitochondrion does not contribute to ATP production. At the peak of a parasitemic wave, slender forms differentiate into a quiescent, cell cycle-arrested stage with stumpy morphology (stumpy form) which has a more developed mitochondrion and expresses citric acid cycle activities and an incomplete electron transport chain (5.Durieux P.O. Schütz P. Brun R. Köhler P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6.Vickerman K.

Hajduk S.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In culture, differentiation to the stumpy stage is induced by a cell density sensing mechanism acting via the cAMP second messenger pathway (9.Reuner B. Vassella E. Yutzy B. Boshart M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 10.Vassella E. Reuner B. Yutzy B. Boshart M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2661-2671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A population of stumpy forms, in turn, can be triggered to differentiate rapidly and synchronously to the next stage in the life cycle, the procyclic forms, which populate the fly midgut and rely on respiration of proline as their major energy source. Therefore, induction of Krebs cycle enzymes and of a respiratory chain in stumpy forms is regarded as a preadaptation to the fly environment (8.Priest J.W. Hajduk S.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The signal for differentiation to procyclic forms in the midgut of the tsetse is unknown; however, the process can be triggered in culture by a temperature shift to 27 °C or most efficiently by addition of cis-aconitate or citrate to the culture medium (11.Brun R. Schonenberger M. Z. Parasitenk. 1981; 66: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 12.Matthews K.R. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2609-2618PubMed Google Scholar). The differentiation inducing effect ofcis-aconitate and citrate is highly specific. The peculiar role of these substrates in triggering a developmental switch and the coordinate induction of the citric acid cycle enzymes during differentiation to the stumpy stage prompted us to identify and characterize the aconitase gene of T. brucei. Aconitase (citrate(isocitrate) hydro-lyase, EC 4.2.1.3) catalyzes the stereospecific dehydration/rehydration reaction of citrate to isocitrate via the intermediate cis-aconitate (13.Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Stout C.D. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2335-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Activity of the enzyme critically depends on the presence of an iron sulfur [4Fe4S] cluster in the catalytic center that is highly sensitive to oxygen. Upon oxidation the cluster is converted to an inactive [3Fe4S] form (14.Kent T.A. Dreyer J.L. Kennedy M.C. Huynh B.H. Emptage M.H. Beinert H. Munck E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells express two distinct aconitases encoded by separate genes: (a) mitochondrial aconitase and (b) a bifunctional cytoplasmic aconitase that is identical to the iron-regulatory protein (IRP-1).1 IRP-1 is an RNA-binding protein interacting with iron-responsive elements (IREs) in the untranslated regions of several mRNAs (15.Theil E.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), including the transferrin receptor and ferritin H- and L-subunits (16.Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 335-362Google Scholar), and functions in coordinate post-transcriptional regulation of cellular iron metabolism (17.Kühn L.C. Hentze M.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1992; 47: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18.Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). In iron-loaded cells, IRP-1 assembles a cubane [4Fe-4S] cluster, which renders it active as a cytosolic aconitase but inactive for RNA binding. Disassembly of the cluster upon iron starvation yields the active RNA-binding form that regulates stability or translation of target RNAs. The two conformations and functional states are mutually exclusive. Cytoplasmic aconitase activity might also be required for a glyoxalate cycle in specialized animal tissues like brown adipose tissue (19.Escher C.L. Widmer F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 803-813PubMed Google Scholar). In plants, where cytoplasmic aconitase is developmentally regulated and abundant in germinating seeds, its role in the glyoxalate cycle is well established (20.De Bellis L. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. Alpi A. Planta. 1995; 195: 464-468Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21.Hayashi M. De Bellis L. Alpi A. Nishimura M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 669-680PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report on cloning and characterization of a protozoan aconitase that is closely related to animal IRPs and plant aconitases. Dual subcellular localization of the developmentally regulated T. brucei enzyme suggests that it not only takes part in the mitochondrial Krebs cycle but may have a yet unknown function in the cytoplasm of the parasite. Bloodstream forms of the pleomorphic T. brucei brucei clone AnTat1.1 were grown in rodents as described (22.Vassella E. Boshart M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The monomorphic clone MiTat1.4 (23.Cross G.A.M. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 393-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) was cultured in HMI-9 medium (24.Hirumi H. Hirumi K. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum but without Serum PlusTM at 37 °C and 5% (v/v) CO2. Procyclic forms were cultured at 27 °C in SDM-79 (25.Brun R. Schonenberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Bloodstream forms were purified from host blood by ion exchange chromatography (26.Lanham S.M. Godfrey D.G. Exp. Parasitol. 1970; 28: 521-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar) on DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) columns. For stable transfection, 10 μg of NotI-linearized plasmid DNA was electroporated (BTX 600 Electro Cell Manipulator, 1.2 kV, 25 microfarads, 186 ohms, 2-mm electrode distance) into 4 × 107 MiTat1.4 bloodstream forms in a volume of 0.5 ml (27.Carruthers V.B. van der Ploeg L.H.T. Cross G.A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2537-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After 24 h, cells were selected with 0.5 μg/ml phleomycin, and after several passages, drug-resistant pools were differentiatedin vitro into procyclic forms as described before (22.Vassella E. Boshart M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The consensus motifs IGTDSHT and NM(C/G)(A/P)E(I/Y)GA from the first and second domain of aconitases and IRPs of several species (underlined in Fig. 3) were selected to design pools of degenerate primers as follows: sense primer 5′ ATHGGNACNGAYTCNCAYAC 3′ (768-fold degenerated) and antisense primer 5′ GCNCCRTAYTCNGSRCMCATRTT 3′ (1024-fold degenerated) were used to amplify 1 μg of genomic AnTat1.1 DNA (30 cycles, 1.5 min 94 °C, 2 min 45 °C, and 2 min 72 °C) using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). Products of expected size (300 bp) were cloned into aSmaI-linearized pBluescriptSKII(+) vector and transformed into Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue MRA (Stratagene). GenomicT. brucei DNA was cut with SacII andPstI and separated on a preparative 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel, and individual size fractions in the range of 3–4 kb were eluted. The fraction containing the 3.6-kb SacII-PstI fragment (Fig. 2) was identified by Southern blotting and was used to construct a library in plasmid pBluescriptSKII(+) cut withSacII and PstI which was transformed intoE. coli DH5α. Tbaco1.1 (Fig. 2) was isolated by two rounds of bacterial colony screening with the 311-bp TbACO fragment as probe. For inverted PCR of the 3′-end of TbACO, genomic T. brucei AnTat1.1 DNA was digested with SacII and separated on a preparative 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel, and the size fraction between 5 and 7.5 kb in size was isolated and circularized with T4 DNA ligase. For amplification, the nested primer pairs 5′ CGGGCAAGATACTCAAGGTTCACT 3′ (JS/5.4) plus 5′ GGCGACTCCATAACCACAGACCAT 3′ (IRP.4) and 5′ CTCTTGTGGCAGTTCTCGC 3′ (JS5–2) plus 5′ ACGGCTCTTCCTTCAGTG 3′ (IRP.1) were used.Figure 2Restriction map of the TbACOlocus and cloning strategy. Genomic cleavage sites ofEcoRI (E), HindIII (H),PstI (P), and SacII (S) are indicated for strain AnTat1.1 of T. brucei. The blow up represents the genomic SacII-PstI fragment (clone Tbaco1.1, GenBankTM accession number AF127456) that was isolated by screening with the 311-bp PCR fragment indicated by ahatched box. The TbACO open reading frame isboxed. The cDNA at the 3′-end (reverse transcriptase-PCR, GenBankTM accession number AF127457) was amplified with nested gene-specific primers RIRP2 (3.Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) and RIRP1 (4.Clayton C.E. Michels P. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 465-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Four independent cDNA clones contributed 75 amino acids of coding region (boxed) as well as 254 bp of 3′-UTR. Thetrans-splice site (marked by an AG dinucleotide) at position −100 relative to the first ATG was determined from the sequence of 3 independent 5′-RACE clones amplified with nested gene-specific primers JS5-1 (1.Vickerman K. Br. Med. Bull. 1985; 41: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) and JS5-2 (2.Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar). The 3′-end of the gene was cloned by inverted PCR (INV-PCR, GenBankTM accession numberAF190556) using the nested primer pairs JS/5.4 (5.Durieux P.O. Schütz P. Brun R. Köhler P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) plus IRP.4 (6.Vickerman K. Nature. 1965; 208: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and JS5-2 (2.Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar) plus IRP.1 (7.Overath P. Czichos J. Haas C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The 3′-ends of TbACO transcripts (wavy lines) were mapped by 3′-RACE PCR using the gene-specific primer IRP.6 (8.Priest J.W. Hajduk S.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Two PCR products of 500 and 810 bp (indicated by arrows) were obtained, thus calculated sizes of TbACO mRNAs (without poly(A)-tail) of 4197 and 4507 nt, respectively. The transcript sizes estimated from Northern blots (see Fig. 6) are indicated (4.2 and 4.7 kb).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For 5′-RACE, 20 μg of total RNA isolated from procyclic forms of AnTat1.1 were reversely transcribed with theTbACO sequence-specific oligonucleotide 5′ GGGAACGCCAGTGAAGTC 3′ (JS5–1) and SuperscriptTM Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). After RNA hydrolysis the cDNA was PCR-amplified with a primer matching the spliced leader sequence of T. brucei, 5′ GGGAATTCCGCTATTATTAGAACAGTTTCT 3′ (where underlines indicate restriction sites) and the nested TbACO-specific primer JS5-2 (see above). The resulting PCR fragment was digested withEcoRI and EcoRV and cloned into pBluescriptSKII(+) cut with EcoRI and HincII. For cDNA cloning of the 3′-end of the gene, reverse transcription was primed with a XhoI/SalI/ClaI d(T)17 primer (5′ GACTCGAGTCGACATCGAT17 3′) followed by PCR with the adaptor primer 5′ GACTCGAGTCGACATCG 3′ and theTbACO-specific nested primers 5′ ATGGCAGGAATCCACATA 3′ (RIRP-2) and 5′ TGCCAACACCCGACTTG 3′ (RIRP-1) or with adaptor primer and primer 5′ GGGAACTATGTGTGATGAGG 3′ (IRP.6). The sequence of the antisense strand was determined from overlapping deletion clones of plasmid Tbaco1.1, constructed as recommended by the supplier of the Nested Deletion Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The nucleotide sequences of the sense strand, of cDNA clones, and of the genomic clone obtained by inverted PCR were determined by primer walking. The SequenaseTM version 2.0 Sequencing Kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and a fluorescent dideoxynucleotide terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) were used for manual and automated sequencing, respectively. The complete coding region of TbACO was assembled from a 104-bpPstI-EcoRV fragment derived from a 3′-RACE clone and the genomic clone Tbaco1.1 opened with PstI (partial digest) and XbaI (blunted). For convenient cloning, aTbACO cassette was constructed as follows: aBamHI site was introduced immediately upstream of the start codon by recombinant PCR using the primers 5′ CGGGATCCATGCTCAGCACGATGAAG 3′ and JS5-2 (see cDNA cloning), and a BglII site was introduced exactly after the stop codon with the primers RIRP-2 (see cDNA cloning) and 5′ GAAGATCTCTACAAATTACCCTTGATT 3′. The cassette was then recloned between BamHI and SalI of BluescriptSKII(−). Details of these constructions are available upon request. For bacterial expression, the following TbACO fragments were cloned into the hexahistidine tag expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen): aStuI-PstI fragment of Tbaco1.1 resulting in pQE31/13 (88 kDa), a BamHI-PstI fragment of Tbaco1.1 resulting in pQE30/4 (90 kDa), and the full-lengthTbACO cassette excised with BamHI andSalI resulting in pQE30/5 (99 kDa). A Cys-446 → Ser point mutation and a Cys-512 → Ser/Cys-515 → Ser double point mutation were introduced into TbACO using the TransformerTMSite-directed Mutagenesis Kit (CLONTECH). To this end, a 302-bp ApaI-SmaI fragment of plasmid Tbaco1.1 was subcloned into pBluescriptSKII(−), and the mutagenesis was performed using the mutation primer MP1 5′ GCTATTACTTCCTCTACAAACACCTCG 3′ and the selection primer Sp1 5′ GTGACTGGTGAATACTCAACCAAG 3′. For the double mutant, aSmaI/SalI 1273-bp fragment of pQE30/5 was subcloned into pBluescriptSKII(−), and the mutation primer MP2 5′ CGGGGTACGGCAGCATGACAAGCATCGGGAATG 3′ and the selection primer Sp1 were used (nucleotide mismatches are underlined). The mutagenized fragments were verified by sequencing and were cloned into pQE30/5 in exchange to the respective wild type fragments. For expression of C-terminally tagged TbACO in trypanosomes, the insertion vector pLew20 which targets the rDNA spacer of T. brucei (28.Wirtz E. Hoek M. Cross G.A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4626-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was opened with HindIII andBamHI; the ends were blunted, and the vector fragment was gel-purified. The Ty-1 epitope (29.Bastin P. Bagherzadeh A. Matthews K.R. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) was attached to the C terminus of TbACO by recombinant PCR using the TbACO-specific primer 5′ ATGGCAGGAATCCACATA 3′ and the Ty-1 primer 5′ GCTCTAGACTAGTCAAGTGGATCCTGGTTAGTATGGACCTCCAAATTACCCTTGATTTTC 3′ including an XbaI site. The resulting PCR fragment was cleaved with XbaI, blunted, and then cleaved withEco47III. The TbACO cassette was cut withBamHI, blunted, and then cut with Eco47III, followed by isolation of the fragment. The three fragments were ligated together to give pLewacotag. Genomic DNA was prepared by phenol extraction, dialysis, and isopropyl alcohol precipitation. After electrophoresis in TAE buffer, agarose gels were blotted onto a GeneScreenTM nylon membrane (NEN Life Science Products) by capillary transfer. The hybridization and washing temperatures were adjusted to 5 °C below the calculated melting temperature of specific DNA-DNA hybrids for high stringency conditions and to 40 °C below the calculated melting temperature for low stringency conditions, using the buffers described in Boshart et al. (30.Boshart M. Weih F. Nichols M. Schütz G. Cell. 1991; 66: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). ATbACO-specific probe of defined length (nucleotides 1778–2088 of Tbaco1.1) was generated by primer extension (31.Mizobuchi M. Frohman L.A. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 350-354PubMed Google Scholar) with polylinker-specific primers (SK and KS) using as template anEagI- and ApaI-cut pBluescript plasmid containing the 311-bp PCR fragment. Total RNA was isolated using the guanidinium isothiocyanate/CsCl2 cushion method (32.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar) and was fractionated on 1.2% (w/v) formaldehyde-agarose gels and blotted onto GeneScreenTM (NEN Life Science Products) nylon membrane. A riboprobe corresponding to nucleotides 1778–2088 of Tbaco1.1 was prepared and hybridized as described (30.Boshart M. Weih F. Nichols M. Schütz G. Cell. 1991; 66: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar)· The blot was washed three times for 30 min in 0.1× SSC, 1% (w/v) SDS at 65 °C. For control, the same blot was probed with the random prime-labeled plasmid pR4 containing part of the rRNA locus (33.White T.C. Rudenko G. Borst P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9471-9489Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar)· E. coli M15rep4 (34.Villarejo M.R. Zabin I. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 120: 466-474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) transformed with pQE30/5 was grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin up to anA 600 of 0.7, and TbACO expression was induced by addition of 1 mm IPTG for 3 h at 25 °C. Bacteria were freeze/thaw lysed and sonicated in 50 mmNaxHyPO4 buffer, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, 40 μg/ml bestatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml Pefabloc® (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin. The soluble material was purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography on a Ni2+-NTA column (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The yield was in the range of 230 μg of soluble protein from 1 liter of culture. For further purification, this protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% (v/v) glycerol and subjected to ion exchange chromatography on a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The N terminus of the recombinant protein was verified by microsequencing; an amino acid analysis gave results compatible with the predicted sequence of recombinant TbACO, and a mass spectrum gave a value of 99902.5 mass units compared with a theoretical value of 99702.7 (all performed by the protein chemistry core facility of the MPI for Biochemistry). For aconitase activity measurements, recombinant full-length TbACO (99 kDa) was expressed and purified as described above, except that all buffers contained 10 mmcitrate and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol and were degassed and saturated with nitrogen. The aconitase substrate citrate protects from oxidative inactivation (35.Murakami K. Yoshino M. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 41: 481-486PubMed Google Scholar). For concentration and buffer exchange (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm citrate, 1 mm DTT), CentriconTM100 ultrafiltration units (Amicon) were used. Protein samples were stored in a glove bag under argon or nitrogen atmosphere at 4 °C. Iron loading under reducing conditions was performed in a glove bag with 200 μg of protein (in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) by adding 10× loading buffer (10 mm MES, pH 5.5, 10 mm ferrous ethylenediammonium sulfate, 50 mmDTT) and incubating for 25 min at 37 °C similar as described by Kennedy et al. (36.Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.H. Dreyer J.L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The loaded protein was aliquoted and stored on ice in nitrogen atmosphere until measurement of activity with a double beam photometer (Perkin-Elmer Lambda 5). For the UV assay described by Henson and Cleland (37.Henson C.P. Cleland W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3833-3838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 1 ml of 90 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing dl-isocitrate (Sigma) ranging from 1 to 20 mm was equilibrated at 25 °C, and the formation of cis-aconitate was recorded for 6 min (extinction coefficient for cis-aconitate ε = 3.4 mm−1 cm−1 at 240 nm). Assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics, nonlinear curve fitting of kinetic data was performed with Kaleidagraph 3.0.8 (Synergy Software) and theK m and V max values were calculated from a reciprocal plot according to Hanes (38.Hanes C.S. Biochem. J. 1932; 26: 1406-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aconitase activity in whole cell extracts was measured as described by Overathet al. (7.Overath P. Czichos J. Haas C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay as supplied by Bio-Rad and bovine serum albumin as standard. For the first series of immunizations (including “rat 1”), an 88-kDa recombinant TbACO fragment (pQE31/13) was purified by Ni2+-NTA chromatography, electrophoresed on an 8% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The 88-kDa band was excised from the membrane (150–200 μg of protein), and the dried nitrocellulose was powdered, emulsified with complete Freund adjuvant, and injected intraperitoneally in female Wistar rats. Rats were boostered once with 150 μg of protein after 4 weeks. Two weeks later, the animals were bled, and sera were affinity purified as described (39.Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11955-11957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For a second series of immunizations (including “rat 2” and “rabbit 1”) the recombinant full-length TbACO (pQE30/5) was purified by Ni2+-NTA chromatography in soluble form and directly emulsified with complete Freund adjuvant. Rabbits were immunized by subdermal injection of 500 μg of protein followed by 3 booster injections at regular intervals. Rabbit anti-phosphoglycerate kinase C antibodies were a kind gift of P. Michels. Rabbit anti-Synechococcus sp. HSP60 antiserum was purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. The BB2 hybridoma (anti-Ty1 monoclonal antibody) was a kind gift of P. Bastin and K. Gull. Rabbit anti-Dictyostelium α-tubulin antiserum was obtained from G. Gerisch. Whole cell extracts were prepared by transferring small volumes of PBS-washed and resuspended trypanosomes into SDS-lysis buffer preheated to 100 °C. Samples were boiled for 5 min and sonified. Proteins were separated on 8% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels and were transferred onto HybondTMpolyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a semi-dry blotting procedure (40.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (43838) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked overnight in TBST (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20), 5% (w/v) dried milk powder, incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies (1:1000) in TBST, 5% (w/v) dried milk powder, washed in TBST, and incubated with a second antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase for 1 h. Membranes were developed using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or incubated in staining solution (0.41 mm NBT; 0.38 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate; 4 mmMgCl2; 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5), respectively. Exposed films were scanned on a flat bed scanner (AGFA, model Arcus II), and the signals were quantified using NIH image software (version 1.60). Alternatively, the primary antibody was followed by a 1-h incubation with 1 μCi of 125I-protein A (70–100 μCi/μg), several wash steps in TBST, and autoradiography on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Cell fractionation was essentially done as described by Häusler et al. (41.Häusler T. Stierhof Y.-D. Wirtz E. Clayton C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (75)"

Adrenal and gonadal strategies for P450scc gene transcription are essentially identical and depend on the orphan nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor-1, but the placental strategy for transcription of P450scc employs cis-acting elements different from those used in the adrenal strategy and is independent of steroidogenic factor-1. Because placental expression of P450scc is required for human pregnancy, we sought factors that bind to the −155/−131 region of the human P450scc promoter, which participates in its placental but not adrenal or gonadal transcription. A yeast one-hybrid screen of 2.4 × 106 cDNA clones from human placental JEG-3 cells yielded two unique clones; one is the previously described transcription factor LBP-1b, which is induced by HIV, type I infection of lymphocytes, and the other is a new factor, termed LBP-9, that shares 83% amino acid sequence identity with LBP-1b. When expressed in transfected yeast, both factors bound specifically to the −155/−131 DNA; antisera to LBP proteins supershifted the LBP-9·DNA complex and inhibited formation of the LBP-1b·DNA complex. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction detected LBP-1b in human placental JEG-3, adrenal NCI-H295A, liver HepG2, cervical HeLa, and monkey kidney COS-1 cells, but LBP-9 was detected only in JEG-3 cells. When the −155/−131 fragment was linked to a minimal promoter, co-expression of LBP-1b increased transcription 21-fold in a dose-dependent fashion, but addition of LBP-9 suppressed the stimulatory effect of LBP-1b. The roles of LBP transcription factors in normal human physiology have been unclear.

Mineralocorticoids, produced by the adrenal cortex, are needed to retain sodium and maintain blood pressure (1.Fardella C.E. Miller W.L. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1996; 16: 443-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); glucocorticoids, also produced by the adrenal cortex, raise blood sugar but also play roles in numerous physiologic processes (2.Baxter J.D. Rousseau G.G. Glucocorticoid Hormone Action. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1979Crossref Google Scholar); and androgens and estrogens, produced by the gonads, are required for reproduction (3.Dufau M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 483-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar,4.Richards J.S. Hedin L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 441-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In human beings, absence of mineralocorticoids leads to death in infancy, absence of glucocorticoids may lead to death during times of severe physiologic stress, and absence of sex steroids would, eventually, lead to death of the species. Thus, the regulation of steroid hormone biosynthesis is of fundamental interest. The role of steroid hormones in the fetus is less obvious, and there are important species differences among mammals. Human fetuses can develop normally, reach term gestation, undergo normal parturition, and make initial adaptations to extrauterine life in the absence of mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, or sex steroids (5.Miller W.L. Clin. Perinatol. 1998; 25: 799-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, normal human gestation is totally dependent on the action of progesterone to suppress uterine contractility and thus to maintain pregnancy (6.Strauss III, J.F. Gåfvels M.E. King B.F. DeGroot L.J. Endocrinology. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1995: 2171-2206Google Scholar). Progesterone is initially provided by the mother's ovarian corpus luteum, but after about 8–10 weeks virtually all progesterone is produced by the placental syncytiotrophoblast cells, which are fetal tissue (7.Csapo A.I. Pulkkinen M.O. Wiest W.B. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1973; 115: 759-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 8.Csapo A.I. Pulkkinen M.O. Obstet. Gynecol. Surv. 1978; 83: 69-81Crossref Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Therefore, placental synthesis of progesterone is essential for the initiation of human life (5.Miller W.L. Clin. Perinatol. 1998; 25: 799-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis of placental progesterone, and of all other steroid hormones, begins with the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone by mitochondrial cytochrome P450scc, which is the rate-limiting and hormonally regulated enzymatic step in steroidogenesis (9.Miller W.L. Endocr. Rev. 1988; 9: 295-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). Human P450scc is encoded by a single gene (10.Morohashi K. Sogawa K. Omura T. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), formally termed CYP11A (11.Nebert D.W. Nelson D.R. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Feyereisen R. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Gonzalez F.J.

Because of its key role in the production of all steroid hormones, the transcription of the P450scc gene has been the subject of intensive study (reviewed in Refs. 16.Hum D.W. Miller W.L. Clin. Chem. 1993; 39: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17.Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27783-27786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Vitam. Horm. 1995; 51: 339-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Such studies led to the discovery of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1),1 also known as Ad4-BP, an orphan nuclear receptor that is essential for fetal adrenal and gonadal development as well as for expression of all the steroidogenic genes in these tissues (19.Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). However, although SF-1 is expressed in many tissues (20.Morohashi K. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 169-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), very little SF-1 is expressed in other tissues that contain P450scc including brain, embryonic gut, and placenta (20.Morohashi K.

Miller W.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) indicate that the SF-1 sites in the P450scc promoter are not involved in P450scc transcription in these tissues. As placental P450scc expression and progesterone synthesis are mandatory for successful pregnancy and as little is known about SF-1-independent expression of genes for steroidogenic enzymes, we have studied the transcription of P450scc in human placental JEG-3 cells (24.Moore C.C.D. Hum D.W. Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2045-2058PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Hum D.W. Aza-Blanc P. Miller W.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We now report the cloning and characterization of two transcription factors that modulate the human placental expression of P450scc; both factors are related to the LBP-1 family of transcription factors induced by HIV, type I infection of lymphocytes (26.Yoon J.B.

A double-stranded oligonucleotide (see Table I) corresponding to bases −155 to −131 of the human P450scc promoter (30.Moore C.C.D. Brentano S.T. Miller W.L. Mol. Cell.

This P450scc −155/−131 ×4 DNA was inserted into plasmid pHISi (CLONTECH) cleaved with EcoRI andXbaI and was also inserted into plasmid pLacZi cleaved withEcoRI and SalI, thus placing the −155/−131 tetramer immediately upstream from the minimal promoter sequences for the reporter genes HIS3 (in pHISi) and LacZ (in pLacZi). After propagation in E. coli, these plasmids were sequentially transformed into yeast YM4271 using lithium acetate (31.Gietz R.D. Schiesti R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar), and stable, integrated transformants were identified on selective media: His− for pHISi and Ura− for theURA3 marker in pLacZi.Table IOligonucleotide sequences (5′ → 3′)Sense (s) and antisense (as) primers for RT-PCR experimentsLocationNH-1s-4ATGGCCTGGGTGCTCAA175–191NH-1as-1GCAGCTAGCTGAGTGTA848–864NH-9s-1bAGCTGCATGAAGAGACGCT269–287NH-9as-2TCTCGGGACATCTTCAGCA1103–1121NH-32s-1bGATCTCAGTCTGCGGATG794–811NH-32as-2AAGTCATCTTCTGTGCCGT1632–1650c17-s-12CGTGGCTCTCTTGCTGCTTA53–72c17-as-810AGCCATTATCTGAGTTCATCTT849–870scc-s-1GATGCCATCTACCAGATGTT747–766scc-as-1CTCTGAAGTTCTCCAGCATA1478–1497GAPDH-s-1GTATCGTGGAAGGACTCAT566–584GAPDH-as-1TACTCCTTGGTGGCCATGT1049–1067Antisense primers used in 5′ RACE experimentsLocation9-GSP-1CTTGAACACCTTGATCT731–7479-GSP-2TGCAAGCTTGTCGACAGACAGTGGAATATCGATGT482–50132-GSP-1TTTGCTTCATCGTTGAT1202–121832-GSP-2TGTAAGCTTGTCGACCATGATCACACTTCGAACT1006–1024−155/−131 sequences used−155/−131wt-sGATCTCGCTGCAGAAATTCCAGACTGAACCGGATC−155/−131wt-asGATCCGGTTCAGTCTGGAATTTCTGCAGCGAGATC−155/−131mut-sGATCTCGCTTACTTCTAGACAGACTGAACCGGATC−155/−131mut-asGATCCGGTTCAGTCTGTCTAGAAGTAAGCGAGATC Open table in a new tab Both randomly primed and oligo(dT)-primed cDNA made from JEG-3 cell RNA was ligated with phosphorylated EcoRI-NotI-SalI adapters and passed through Sephacryl S-300 to exclude DNA smaller than 300–400 bp.

The plasmid DNA library was introduced by LiAc/polyethylene glycol transformation into the yeast YM4271 (P450scc −155/−131 ×4 HIS3/LacZ) reporter strain and plated onto 16 243 × 243-mm minimal media (SD) Ura−-Leu−-His− plates containing 45 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-trizole. Growth of a small aliquot on SD/Leu− selective media was used to estimate the number of transformants. After 7 days of growth on minimal medium, survivors were assayed for β-galactosidase activity (34.Schneider S. Buchert M. Hovens C.M. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 960-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These plasmid DNAs were isolated from their host yeast and individually transformed intoE. coli DH5α for amplification, restriction endonuclease mapping, and sequencing. Total JEG-3 cell RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using 50 ng of primer 9-GSP1 (see Table I), isolated with GlassMAX DNA spin cartridges (Life Technologies, Inc.), then oligo(dC)-tailed with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The dC-tailed cDNA was amplified by a nested PCR procedure, first using the Abridge Anchor primer (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 9-GSP2, followed by reamplification with primers AUAP (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 9-GSP2, yielding a predominant PCR product of ∼600 bp. This double-stranded cDNA was blunt-ended by T4 DNA polymerase, ligated into SmaI-digested pBluescript II SK+, and sequenced. The full-length cDNA was assembled by ligating the 5′-RACE clone into construct 9pSG5 containing the 3′-end of the cDNA, using theXhoI and Bst107I sites. 5′-RACE was also performed for clone 32 using primers 32-GSP-1 and 32-GSP-2, and the full-length cDNA was assembled by ligating the 5′-RACE clone into pGAD10–32 containing the 3′-end of the cDNA using theXhoI and BclI sites. Total RNA was isolated from JEG-3 cells, NCI-H295A cells, HeLa cells, HepG2 cells, COS-1 cells, and human adrenal tissue. Random primers were used for the first strand cDNA syntheses using reverse transcriptase Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR was done using 5 μl of the first strand cDNA product and oligonucleotides specific for clones 1, 9, 32, human P450c17, and GAPDH (see Table I). Human placental JEG-3 cells (35.Kohler P.O. Bridson W.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1971; 65: 122-126Google Scholar) (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's 21 medium (DME-H21) with 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 5% horse serum. JEG-3 cells were grown to 60–80% confluence on 6-well tissue culture plates and transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation for 6 h with 3 μg of plasmid DNA for each well. After aspirating the calcium phosphate-DNA precipitates, the cells were washed with 3 ml of DME-H21 medium and incubated for an additional 36 h in regular medium. Human adrenal NCI-H295A cells (36.Rodriguez H. Hum D.W. Staels B. Miller W.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Full-length cDNAs for clones 1, 9, and 32 were re-cloned into pSG5 (39.Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) for transfection of mammalian cells. The human P450scc constructs 1xwt−155/−131/TK32LUC and 1xmt−155/−131/TK32LUC were described previously (25.Hum D.W. Aza-Blanc P. Miller W.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As an internal control, 100 ng of pRL-CMV vector (Promega) was co-transfected for each well. Luciferase assays were performed with Dual-Luciferase™ assay system (Promega) using a Monolight 1500 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). Nuclear extracts were prepared from JEG-3 cells and NCI-H295A cells as described (24.Moore C.C.D. Hum D.W. Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2045-2058PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay. Yeast transformed with HIS multicopy vector YEp90 expressing the cDNA for clones 1, 9, or 32 were grown in 50 ml of SD selective media overnight at 30 °C, transferred into 300 ml of YPD media, and incubated for 3 h at 30 °C (40.Heery D.D. Zacharewski T. Pierrat B. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4281-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation, washed once with H2O, and then resuspended in 1.5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 0.4m KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The yeast were vortexed vigorously for 2 min with an equal volume of 450–600-μm glass beads (Sigma), and the debris was pelleted at 4 °C for 15 min at 13,000 rpm. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined, and aliquots of these yeast extracts were stored at −70 °C. Double-stranded wild-type and mutant probes corresponding to bases −155/−131 of the human P450scc promoter (see Table I) were end-labeled by [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs) and purified through a G-50 column. About 10 fmol of labeled probe (20,000 cpm) were incubated at room temperature for 15 min with 5–8 μg of nuclear extracts or yeast cell extracts and various competitor oligonucleotides in a final volume of 15 μl in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmKCl, 1 m EDTA, 4% glycerol, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) added as a nonspecific competitor. For supershift experiments, 1 μl of undiluted rabbit anti-human LBP-1 antiserum was added following formation of the DNA·protein complex and was incubated for an additional 15 min at room temperature. DNA·protein complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis in 4% native polyacrylamide gel in 50 mm Tris base, 38 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.35 μl of β-mercaptoethanol at 20 °C for 90 min at 230 volts. Our previous work demonstrated that the DNA segment between −155 and −131 was required for placental, but not for adrenal or gonadal, transcription of human P450scc (24.Moore C.C.D. Hum D.W. Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2045-2058PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Hum D.W. Aza-Blanc P. Miller W.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30.Moore C.C.D.

Metab. 1997; 82: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the corresponding −155/−131 oligonucleotide formed complexes with nuclear extracts from human placental JEG-3 cells that were not seen with nuclear extracts from human adrenal NCI-H295 cells (25.Hum D.W. Aza-Blanc P. Miller W.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore we sought to clone JEG-3 cell factors that bound to this DNA. Construction of JEG-3 cell cDNA expression libraries and screening 6 × 106 unique λgt11 clones with radiolabeled −155/−131 dimers failed to identify specific clones. 2D. W. Hum, H. Shi, G. K. Fu, and W. L. Miller, unpublished results. Therefore we used the yeast one-hybrid system (41.Wang M.M. Reed R.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) to search for proteins that bind to this DNA. Yeast strain YM4271 was genetically modified to contain selectableHIS3 and LacZ reporter genes under the control of four tandem copies of the −155/−131 element of P450scc. A human placental cDNA library containing 2.4 × 106unique clones was constructed and propagated in E. coli, and the plasmid DNA was transformed into the YM4271 reporter strain. Of approximately 9 × 107 transformants plated onto selective media, 108 robust, apparently Leu+-His+-Ura+ colonies were identified. After further propagation, 52 plasmids showed β-galactosidase activity, and 36 plasmids contained identifiable cDNA inserts. Most clones appeared to be unique on the basis of insert size and endonuclease digestion pattern; however, clone NH1 was present in 7 copies, clone NH9 in 6 copies, and clone NH32 in 2 copies. All clones were subjected to at least one sequencing run from a plasmid primer. BLAST searches showed that none of the unique copy clones bore identifiable relationships to any known transcription factors, but the multicopy clones NH1, 9, and 32 were all related to LBP-1; these clones were then sequenced in their entirety (Fig.1).Figure 1Sequences of clones NH1 (panel A), NH9 (panel B), and NH32 (panel C). Clones NH9 and 32 were completed by 5′-RACE. GenBank™ accession numbers for these sequences are: LBP-1b (NH1),AF198487; LBP-9 (NH9), AF198488; LBP-32 (NH32), AF198489.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1Sequences of clones NH1 (panel A), NH9 (panel B), and NH32 (panel C). Clones NH9 and 32 were completed by 5′-RACE. GenBank™ accession numbers for these sequences are: LBP-1b (NH1),AF198487; LBP-9 (NH9), AF198488; LBP-32 (NH32), AF198489.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The insert in clone NH1 was 3843 bp long, had a long 3′-untranslated region, and encoded a protein of 540 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 62 kDa. The encoded amino acid sequence of NH1 was 98% identical to human LBP-lb. Because the differences between the published LBP-1b amino acid sequence and the sequence encoded by clone NH1 were mainly confined to one region, we considered whether these were alternately spliced products of the same gene. Therefore, we used RT-PCR to amplify the cDNA regions that were different between NH1 and LBP-1b, using total RNA from JEG-3 and NCI-H295A cells and primers flanking the variant region. Sequencing of two JEG-3 and two NCI-H295A clones showed the sequence found in the NH1 cDNA, suggesting that the NH1 sequence is the correct LBP-1b sequence and that the reported sequence of LBP-1b (26.Yoon J.B. Li G. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1776-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) has a short, frameshifted, incorrect amino acid sequence (Fig. 2). Hence we refer to the NH1 cDNA sequence as LBP-1b. The insert in clone NH9 was 4777 bp long, had a long 3′-untranslated region, and had an open reading frame of 1395 bp without an initiating methionine in a Kozak sequence. Therefore we performed 5′-RACE (42.Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar) using JEG-3 cell RNA reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the specific primer 9-GSP1 (Table I) followed by nested PCR. The 591-bp double-stranded RACE/PCR product was cloned and sequenced, showing complete sequence overlap with the 5′-end of NH9, indicating that it was an accurate RACE product. After appropriate ligation of this RACE product, the full-length clone NH9 was 4909 bp long and encoded a protein of 479 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 55 kDa that had 83% amino acid sequence identity to our corrected sequence of LBP-1b and hence is hereafter termed LBP-9. The insert in clone NH32 also appeared to be less than full-length, having an open reading frame of only 1230 bp and lacking an initiating methionine codon in an appropriate Kozak sequence. This clone was also completed by 5′-RACE yielding a sequence of 2250 bp that lacked a complete 3′-untranslated region but contained an open reading frame for 618 amino acids whose sequence was distantly related to human LBP-1b and to the Drosophila transcription factor E1f-1/NTF-1 (43.Bray S.J. Burke B. Brown N.H. Hirsh J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1130-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar,44.Dynlacht B.D. Attardi L.D. Admon A. Freeman M. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1677-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This protein has a predicted molecular mass of 68 kDa that is hereafter designated LBP-32. No previously defined DNA binding motifs, such as a zinc finger, leucine zipper, helix-loop-helix, or homeobox was identified in any of our three clones. Our previous work indicated that the placental expression of human P450scc involved some transcription factors found in both the adrenals and placenta and some transcription factors found in the placenta but not in the adrenals (24.Moore C.C.D. Hum D.W. Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2045-2058PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Hum D.W. Aza-Blanc P. Miller W.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore we sought to determine whether the expression of clones LBP-1b, -9, and -32 was unique to the placenta or occurred in a broader array of human cell types. The highly sensitive procedure of RT-PCR followed by Southern blotting detected LBP-1b expression in steroidogenic human placental JEG-3 cells and adrenal NCI-H295A cells, in human adrenal tissue, in non-steroidogenic human liver HepG2 cells, human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, and monkey kidney COS-1 cells (Fig. 3). By contrast, LBP-9 and -32 were expressed abundantly in placental JEG-3 cells, at very low levels in non-steroidogenic cells, and were not detected in human adrenal NCI-H295A cells or in human adrenal tissue. P450c17, a steroidogenic enzyme expressed in the adrenals, gonads, and brain but not the placenta (13.Voutilainen R. Tapanainen J. Chung B. Matteson K.J. Miller W.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1986; 63: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 15.Mellon S.H. Deschepper C.F. Brain Res. 1993; 629: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) was found in NCI-H295A cells and human adrenal tissue as predicted but not in JEG-3 cells or the non-steroidogenic cell lines, demonstrating the specificity of this RT-PCR experiment. The clones expressing LBP-1b, -9, and -32 had been identified through trans-activation of selectable markers, presumably through specific binding to the incorporated tetramer of the −155/−131 sequence of the human P450scc promoter. Therefore we sought to determine whether the proteins encoded by these three clones would bind this DNA in vitro. The inserts of each clone were sub-cloned into the multicopy vector YEp90, expressed in yeast, and yeast protein extracts were prepared; these yeast extracts and JEG-3 cell nuclear extracts were then used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. As shown in Fig. 4, JEG-3 nuclear extracts created two protein·DNA complexes with end-labeled −155/−131 double-stranded DNA. Complex B appeared to be nonspecific, as it was not competed by a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide; by contrast, complex A was readily competed by a 100-fold excess of unlabeled probe. When the protein·DNA complexes were incubated with rabbit antiserum to human LBP-1a/b (generously provided by Dr. R. Roeder), the anti LBP-1 inhibited the formation of complex A but not complex B. Thus JEG-3 nuclear extract contains a protein that binds to −155/−131 and is immunologically related to LBP-1. Yeast extracts containing the LBP-1b and LBP-9 proteins, but not LBP-32, also formed complexes with the double-stranded −155/−131 DNA (Fig. 4). Yeast-expressed LBP-1b forms complex C, which is competed by cold probe and inhibited by the anti LBP-1 antiserum, similarly to complex A formed by the JEG-3 nuclear extract. However, the mobility of complex C was clearly different from that of complex A, suggesting that LBP-1b does not form JEG-3 cell complex A. The absence of a band corresponding to complex C in JEG-3 nuclear extracts could mean that LBP-1b is of low abundance in JEG-3 cells or that LBP-1b has weak affinity for −155/−131. The complex formed by LBP-9 had the same apparent mobility as JEG-3 complex A, was inhibited by excess cold probe, and unlike the other complexes, was supershifted by the antiserum to LBP-1. Thus LBP-9 may be the protein generating complex A, but the difference between inhibition of complex A formation and supershifting of the LBP-9 complex may mean that complex A is not formed by the LBP-9 protein. Yeast extracts containing LBP-32 did not yield detectable complex formation with the −155/−131 oligonucleotide (not shown), hence LBP-32 was not considered further. To assess the potential roles of LBP-1b and LBP-9 in the regulation of human P450scc gene transcription, we assessed the capacity of mammalian expression vectors for these two proteins to transactivate a single copy of the −151/−131 sequence linked to the minimal 32-base promoter of the thymidine kinase gene (TK32) fused to the luciferase reporter transfected into JEG-3 cells. The −155/−131 sequence increased TK32LUC activity 3.4-fold, but mutation of 10 bases in the −155/−131 sequence reduced this to a 2-fold increase (Fig.5 A). To determine whether LBP-1b or LBP-9 influenced this basal activity, we co-transfected JEG-3 cells with the −155/−131/TK32LUC reporter and vectors expressing either LBP-1b or LBP-9. LBP-1b increased the activity of the wild-type −155/−131 sequence 21-fold but had no effect on the 10-base mutant of −155/−131, whereas LBP-9 had no apparent effect on either the wild-type or mutant −155/131 sequence (Fig. 5 A). When the −155/−131 sequence fused to TK32LUC was co-transfected with increasing amounts of the vector expressing LBP-1b, transcription was increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 B). Thus LBP-1b had a clear stimulatory effect on transcription fostered by the −155/−131 sequence of human P450scc. Because the basal transcription from the −155/−131/TK32LUC construction was low, it was not clear whether LBP-9 had no effect or exerted a suppressive effect. Therefore, we examined the effect of LBP-9 on LBP-1b-induced transcription from −155/−131/TK32LUC in JEG-3 cells. Co-transfection of the −155/−131/TK32LUC reporter construct with 500 ng of the vector for LBP-1b and with increasing amounts of the vector for LBP-9 showed that LBP-9 suppressed the LBP-1b-induced activation of LUC expression in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5 C). Thus, LBP-9 appears to be a transcriptional suppressor, and, in the amounts of protein expressed by our pSG5-based vectors, the suppressive action of LBP-9 appears to override the activating action of LBP-1b. The orphan nuclear receptor SF-1 is required for the production of steroid hormones in the adrenals and gonads but not in the placenta, brain, or other “extra-glandular” tissues. SF-1-independent transcription of P450scc has been demonstrated in the human placenta (24.Moore C.C.D. Hum D.W. Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2045-2058PubMed Google Scholar) and rat brain (23.Zhang P. Rodriguez H. Mellon S.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), prompting a search for factors that can substitute for the essential role of SF-1. Some candidate factors have been identified. SF-1-independent transcription of the rat gene for steroid 17α-hydroxylase (P450c17) can be regulated by two factors operationally termed StF-IT-1 and StF-IT-2 (45.Zhang P. Mellon S.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 891-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and by ku autoantigen (46.Zhang P. Hammer F. Bair S. Wang J. Reeves W.H. Mellon S.H. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). StF-IT-1 has recently been identified as the oncoprotein SET (47.Compagnone, N., Zhang, P., and Mellon, S. (1999) 80th Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society, New Orleans, June 24-27, 1999, p. 118, Abstract OR50–5,Google Scholar), a factor not previously known to be a transcriptional regulator. Thus it appears that an unexpectedly broad array of proteins can regulate the transcription of the genes for the steroidogenic enzymes. We have now added factors related to the LBP group of transcription factors to this growing family. The LBP family of transcription factors was initially characterized as a single cellular factor that bound to two different sites in the HIV, type I promoter (48.Garcia J.A. Wu F.K. Mitsuyasu R. Gaynor R.B. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3761-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 49.Wu F.K. Garcia J.A. Harrich D. Gaynor R.B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 50.Jones K.A. Luciw P.A. Duchange N. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 51.Kato H. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1991; 251: 1476-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Later work showed that there are two related LBP genes, each of which encodes two alternately spliced transcripts, so that LBP-1a and LBP-1b arise from one gene, and LBP-1c and LBP-1d arise from a second gene (26.Yoon J.B. Li G. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1776-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). LBP-1c is identical to the α-globin transcription factor CP2 (52.Lim L.C. Swendeman S.L. Sheffery M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 828-835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and proteins in the LBP family are all related to Elf-1/NTF-1, which is essential for Drosophilaembryogenesis (43.Bray S.J. Burke B. Brown N.H. Hirsh J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1130-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 44.Dynlacht B.D. Attardi L.D. Admon A. Freeman M. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1677-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus the LBP proteins represent an evolutionary ancient family of transcription factors that participate in development. Sequences related to retroviruses are found throughout the human genome (53.Lieb-Mösch C. Bachmann M. Brack-Werner R. Werner T. Erfle V. Hehlmann R. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1992; 6 (suppl.): 72-75Google Scholar, 54.Lieb-Mösch C. Seifarthe W. Virus Genes. 1995; 11: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and frequently regulate expression of adjacent cellular genes, especially those expressed in the placenta (55.Simon M. Haltmeier M. Papakonstantinou G. Werner T. Hehlmann R. Leib-Meosch C. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1994; 8 Suppl. 1: 12-17Google Scholar, 56.Sjøttem E. Anderssen S. Johansen T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 188-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We find no evidence for the insertion of a retroviral regulatory sequence as has been described for placental expression of human pleiotropin (57.Schulte A. Lai S. Kurtz A. Czubayko F. Riegel A. Wellstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14759-14764Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), although sequences similar to −155/−131 are not found in the bovine or rat P450scc promoters. Hence, whereas it may not be surprising to find LBP-related proteins participating in transcriptional regulation in the placenta, to our knowledge this is the first report of an action of LBP-1b on an endogenous, non-viral promoter or of any LBP-related factor participating in the transcriptional regulation of a gene involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis. Our mobility shift data show that LBP-1b and LBP-9 bind to the −151/−131 segment of the human P450scc promoter. In comparison with our previous studies of the P450scc promoter in JEG-3 cells, it appears that LBP-9 forms what was previously called Complex IV, LBP-1b forms a previously undetected complex, and neither LBP-1b or LBP-9 forms what was previously called Complex VII (25.Hum D.W. Aza-Blanc P. Miller W.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our previous data suggested that a 55-kDa protein forming Complex VII was required for basal, placental-specific expression of P450scc, whereas complex IV appeared to be involved in modulating P450scc expression (25.Hum D.W. Aza-Blanc P. Miller W.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our present data are consistent with those earlier observations, suggesting that LBP-1b and LBP-9, respectively, amplify or diminish the level of expression initiated by other factors. This action of LBP-related proteins to function as quantitative “volume controls” rather than as basal “on/off switches” is consistent with their similar action to modulate the level of HIV, type I transcription and is similar to the reciprocal action of Sp1 and Sp3 on numerous genes (58.Birnbaum M. van Wijnen A. Odgren P. Last T. Suske G. Stein G. Stein J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16503-16508Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 59.Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) including adrenal expression of bovine P450scc (60.Ahlgren R. Suske G. Waterman M. Lund J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19422-19428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2015198662,"To provide an explanation of some clinical features observed within rare xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients and to further define the role of XPB, XPD, and cdk7, the three enzymatic subunits of TFIIH, in the transcription reaction, we have examined two defined enzymatic steps: phosphodiester bond formation and promoter escape. We provide evidence that the XPB helicase plays a dominant role in initiation, whereas the XPD helicase plays a minor contributing role in this step. The cyclin-activating kinase subcomplex of TFIIH improves the efficiency of initiation, but this involves only the structural contributions of cyclin-activating kinase rather than enzymatic activity. We demonstrate that XPB patient-derived mutants in TFIIH suffer from defects in initiation. Moreover, mutant analysis shows that in addition to its crucial role in initiation, the XPB helicase plays a critical enzymatic role in the promoter escape, whereas XPD plays an important structural role in the promoter escape process. Finally, using patient-derived mutations in TFIIH, we demonstrate deficiencies in promoter escape for both mutants of the class that suffer from combined xeroderma pigmentosum/Cockayne's syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2022742007,"The 144-kDa λ2 protein of mammalian reovirus catalyzes a number of enzymatic activities in the capping of reovirus mRNA, including the transfer of GMP from GTP to the 5′ end of the 5′-diphosphorylated nascent transcript. This reaction proceeds through a covalently autoguanylylated λ2-GMP intermediate. The smaller size of RNA capping guanylyltransferases from other organisms suggested that the λ2-associated guanylyltransferase would be only a part of this protein.

Although lysine 226 was identified by previous biochemical studies as the active-site residue that forms a phosphoamide bond with GMP in autoguanylylated λ2, mutation of lysine 226 to alanine caused only a partial reduction in guanylyltransferase activity at the autoguanylylation step. Alanine substitution for other lysines within the amino-terminal region of λ2 identified lysine 190 as necessary for autoguanylylation and lysine 171 as an important contributor to autoguanylylation.

The reovirus core particle can producem7NGpppGm2′OpC(pN)n-OH (cap 1) plus-strand RNA from each genomic double-stranded RNA segment in vitro (1.Furuichi Y. Muthukrishnan S. Tomasz J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5043-5053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that it contains all of the enzymes necessary for de novo synthesis of capped mRNA. The RNA polymerase itself is likely to be the λ3 core protein (2.Bruenn J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 18: 217-226Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 3.Starnes M.C. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1993; 193: 356-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Genetic and/or biochemical analyses indicate that the λ1 and μ2 core proteins have nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase activity, possibly associated with an RNA helicase (4.Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7728-7735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Bisaillon M. Bergeron J. Lemay G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18298-18303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The γ phosphate of the newly transcribed mRNA is thought to be removed by the RNA triphosphate phosphohydrolase activity of λ1 (7.Bisaillon M. Lemay G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29954-29957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The λ2 core protein is the reovirus RNA guanylyltransferase, which adds a GMP moiety via a 5′–5′ linkage to the 5′-diphosphorylated mRNA (8.Cleveland D.R. Zarbl H. Millward S. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 307-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This transfer reaction occurs through a covalent intermediate, a phosphoamide bond between the GMP of the donor GTP and a lysine of λ2 (9.Shatkin A.J. Furuichi Y. LaFiandra A.J. Yamakawa M. Compans R.W. Bishop D.J.L. Double-stranded RNA Viruses. Elsevier, New York1983: 43-54Google Scholar, 10.Fausnaugh J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7669-7672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of this covalent bond (called “autoguanylylation” in this paper) is followed by GMP transfer from the enzyme to an acceptor, usually the 5′-diphosphorylated mRNA, although the GMP can be alternatively transferred to a 5′-triphosphorylated RNA or a di- or triphosphorylated nucleoside (11.Mao Z. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1991; 185: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The resulting product is then sequentially methylated by RNA nucleoside-7-N- and 2′-O-methyltransferases, yielding the cap 1 mRNA (1.Furuichi Y. Muthukrishnan S. Tomasz J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5043-5053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that is released through the channel formed by the λ2 pentameric spike (12.Barlett N.M. Gillies S.C. Bullivant S. Bellamy A.R. J. Virol. 1974; 167: 315-326Crossref Google Scholar, 13.Yeager M. Weiner S. Coombs K.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70 (abstr.): 116Google Scholar). Both of the methyltransferase activities appear to reside in λ2 as indicated by the finding that only the λ2 protein in cores is covalently labeled with the methyl donor S-adenosyl-l-methionine after incubation and UV cross-linking (14.Luongo C.L. Contreras C.M. Farsetta D.L. Nibert M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23773-23780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, λ2 is thought to catalyze the last three of the four reactions required for cap 1 formation on reovirus mRNA.The 144-kDa λ2 protein (15.Seliger L.S. Zheng K. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16289-16293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), encoded by the reovirus L2 gene, appears to contain multiple domains. The proposed guanylyltransferase active site (lysine 226) is near the amino terminus (10.Fausnaugh J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7669-7672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is anS-adenosyl-l-methionine-binding site that appears to span residues 827 and 829 (14.Luongo C.L. Contreras C.M. Farsetta D.L. Nibert M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23773-23780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16.Koonin E.V. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A carboxyl-terminalM r 25,000 region is expendable for capping functions but is implicated in anchoring the reovirus cell attachment protein ς1 in virions (17.Dryden K.A. Wang G. Yeager M. Nibert M.L. Coombs K.M. Furlong D.B. Fields B.N. Baker T.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1023-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 18.Luongo C.L. Dryden K.A. Farsetta D.L. Margraf R.M. Severson T.F. Olson N.H. Fields B.N. Baker T.S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8035-8040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A multidomain structure for the λ2 protein is also consistent with what is known for other capping enzymes. The vaccinia virus capping enzyme that catalyzes the first three reactions required for cap 1 formation is a heterodimer composed of two subunits encoded by separate genes (19.Martin S.A. Paoletti E. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9322-9329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Morgan J.R. Cohen L.K. Roberts B.E. J.

By biochemical analysis of proteolytic products, the capping enzyme is separable into a region with RNA triphosphate phosphohydrolase and guanylyltransferase activity and a region with RNA nucleoside-7-N-methyltransferase activity (22.Higman M.A. Bourgeois N. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16430-16437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9690-9695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TheSaccharomyces cerevisiae capping enzyme is a complex of two separate gene products (24.Shibagaki Y. Itoh N. Yamada H. Shibekazu N. Mizumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9521-9528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), one having RNA triphosphate phosphohydrolase and the other having RNA guanylyltransferase activity (25.Itoh N. Yamada H. Kaziro Y. Mizumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1989-1995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two examples suggest that capping enzymes can be multifunctional and that the guanylyltransferase region may be separated biochemically (vaccinia virus) or genetically (yeast) from the rest of the protein. In the case of the Chlorella virus PBCV-1, the RNA guanylyltransferase is a 330-amino acid monofunctional enzyme (26.Ho C.K. van Etten J.L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6658-6664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The small size of this guanylyltransferase and the guanylyltransferase regions of the other capping enzymes suggests that only a portion of the 144-kDa λ2 protein is likely to be required for its RNA guanylyltransferase activity.For most RNA guanylyltransferases, a KXDG active-site motif has been proposed based on sequence comparisons (27.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Fresco L.D. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1997; 94: 9573-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For the RNA guanylyltransferases of vaccinia virus, S. cerevisiae, and baculovirus, the identity of the active site has been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis (27.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Schwer B. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4328-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31.Jin J. Dong W. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10011-10019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the PBCV-1 RNA guanylyltransferase, crystallographic analysis indicates that the active-site lysine interacts with the substrate GTP and that the other residues of the consensus motif interact with the RNA or nucleotide acceptor (32.Håkansson K. Doherty A.J. Shuman S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 33.Håkansson K. Wigley D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1505-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The RNA guanylyltransferases, as well as RNA and DNA ligases, are members of the RNA/DNA nucleotidyltransferase superfamily (27.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Fresco L.D. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6624-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29.Wang S.P. Deng L. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9573-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), enzymes that mediate nucleotidyl transfer to RNA or DNA via a covalent intermediate. The active-site motif for this entire superfamily is KX(D/N)G (27.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Fresco L.D. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6624-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29.Wang S.P. Deng L. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9573-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The RNA guanylyltransferases of members of the family Reoviridaelack sequences that precisely match this consensus motif (15.Seliger L.S. Zheng K. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16289-16293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Bisaillon M. Lemay G. Virology. 1997; 236: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For example, the sequence of the proposed active site in the reovirus λ2 protein is 226KPTNG. This sequence is similar to the nucleotidyl transferase superfamily motif, but the alignment is disrupted by insertion of a proline residue after the lysine in λ2. The proposed guanylyltransferase active site for the other familyReoviridae members rotavirus (KPTGN) and bluetongue virus (KLTGN) is based on the proposed reovirus active site (34.Bisaillon M. Lemay G. Virology. 1997; 236: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).A previous effort to identify the λ2 residue that forms the phosphoamide bond with GMP used a combination of proteolysis and chemical cleavage of reovirus virions autoguanylylated with [32P]GMP to show that a lysine residue in λ2 is the site of covalent linkage to GMP (10.Fausnaugh J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7669-7672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of proteolyzed, [32P]GMP-labeled reovirus particles with λ2 peptide-specific antibodies indirectly identified lysine 226 as the residue to which GMP is likely attached. A similar approach involving proteolysis and chemical cleavage identified the active-site lysine of the vaccinia virus guanylyltransferase (35.Niles E.G. Christen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24986-24989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the identity of the vaccinia virus active-site lysine was subsequently confirmed by the analysis of site-directed mutants for autoguanylylation activity (27.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To extend characterization of the reovirus RNA guanylyltransferase, we expressed recombinant λ2 and analyzed its properties. Utilizing a biochemical approach, we localized a region necessary and sufficient for guanylyltransferase activity to an amino-terminal M r 42,000 fragment of λ2. Since this region contains lysine 226, we generated mutant K226A by alanine substitution. Analysis of the mutant indicated that lysine 226 is not necessary for λ2 guanylyltransferase activity. Alanine substitution for other lysines in the M r 42,000 region identified lysine 190 as the probable site of covalent GMP linkage and lysine 171 as important for autoguanylylation activity. Based on these findings, we propose a novel active-site motif for the RNA guanylyltransferases of mammalian reoviruses and otherReoviridae family members.DISCUSSIONOur rλ2 protein expressed in insect cells from a baculovirus vector has guanylyltransferase activity using either GDP or GTP as GMP acceptor. In contrast to published observations with rλ2 expressed in mammalian cells from a vaccinia virus vector (11.Mao Z. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1991; 185: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), however, we were unsuccessful at demonstrating guanylyltransferase activity with baculovirus-expressed rλ2 using either 5′-diphosphorylated reovirus RNA or poly(A) RNA as acceptor (data not shown). Given this limitation in the activity of the baculovirus-expressed protein, which might be explained by a defect in allowing RNA molecules into the acceptor region of the enzyme, the conclusions we reach about amino acids required for GMP transfer must be considered as tentative with regard to RNA acceptors.Unlike core-associated λ2, rλ2 is hypersensitive to cleavage into complementary M r 42,000 and 100,000 fragments that dissociate in solution. Retention of both autoguanylylation and GMP transfer activities by the M r 42,000 fragment suggested that it is both necessary and sufficient to act as a guanylyltransferase. The M r 42,000 region contains the active site originally localized by direct biochemical analysis to the region between amino acids 131 and 266 (10.Fausnaugh J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7669-7672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further indirect biochemical analysis in the previous study identified lysine 226 as the active-site residue that forms a phosphoamide bond with GMP (10.Fausnaugh J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7669-7672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The previously identified active-site motif 226KPTNG in reovirus λ2 is anomalous for two reasons. First it is not conserved outside the family Reoviridae. Of the known nucleotidyl transferases, at least 13 RNA guanylyltransferases, 16 DNA ligases, and one RNA ligase have the motif KXDG (27.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Fresco L.D. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6624-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29.Wang S.P. Deng L. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9573-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 31.Jin J. Dong W. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10011-10019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two DNA ligases of African swine fever virus and the S. cerevisiaetRNA ligase have the motif KXNG (27.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Fresco L.D. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6624-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The second reason is that insertion of additional residues may interfere with noncovalent bonding of one of the substrates. Based on the structure of the PBCV-1 guanylyltransferase (32.Håkansson K. Doherty A.J. Shuman S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 33.Håkansson K. Wigley D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1505-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and the ATP-dependent DNA ligase of bacteriophage T7 (44.Subramanya H.S. Doherty A.J. Ashford S.R. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1996; 85: 607-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), the lysine in the active-site motif covalently binds GMP or AMP, respectively, and the remaining residues interact with the nucleotide acceptor in RNA for PBCV-1 or the ATP for T7 DNA ligase.As was done for the vaccinia virus RNA guanylyltransferase (27.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we chose to confirm the identity of the active-site lysine in reovirus λ2 by site-directed mutagenesis. Since alanine substitution has been used to identify the active-site lysine of the RNA guanylyltransferase of S. cerevisiae (30.Schwer B. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4328-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and baculovirus (31.Jin J. Dong W. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10011-10019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we generated the λ2 mutant K226A. Based on the demonstrable guanylyltransferase activity of this mutant, we concluded that lysine 226 is not the active-site residue. This conclusion has ramifications for the guanylyltransferases of the other members of the double-stranded RNA virus family Reoviridae and brings into question the functional significance of the similar motifs recently identified in the rotavirus and bluetongue virus RNA guanylyltransferases (34.Bisaillon M. Lemay G. Virology. 1997; 236: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).In addition to lysine 226, the M r 42,000 region contains seven lysines at positions 44, 89, 94, 171, 190, 197, and 372 (15.Seliger L.S. Zheng K. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16289-16293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A series of six alanine substitution mutants were generated to identify the active-site residue. Lysines 44, 89, and 94 are not necessary for activity, based on mutants K44A, K89A, and K94A having approximately wild type levels of autoguanylylation activity. Lysine 197, like lysine 226, is not necessary for activity but affects the level of autoguanylylation. These two residues may function to stabilize the structure of the active site or the bound GTP, consistent with K226A having decreased autoguanylylation activity while maintaining wild type levels of GMP transfer. Lysine 171 is likely to be critical for substrate binding, since K171A showed less than 1% of wild type autoguanylylation activity. Based on the severe defect in autoguanylylation of the K190A mutant, lysine 190 is proposed to be necessary for activity and to be the active-site residue for formation of the phosphoamide bond.Lysine 190 in the reovirus λ2 protein is in a sequence context, KDLS, that lacks similarity with the consensus active-site motif (KXDG) of the well characterized class of eukaryotic and viral RNA guanylyltransferases (27.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Fresco L.D. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6624-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29.Wang S.P. Deng L. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9573-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This lack of similarity suggests that the λ2 active site may be formed via a novel protein fold. Sequences similar to the λ2 KDLS sequence were found to be widely conserved among the RNA guanylyltransferases of otherReoviridae family members within the genera Rotavirus, Orbivirus, and Phytoreovirus (data not shown) and may suggest that the enzymes from these other viruses share a novel active-site motif with reovirus λ2. Additionally, the consensus sequence KXDG is not strictly conserved among the RNA guanylyltransferases of any of these viruses, although KXXG motifs are conserved at two positions in the aligned orbivirus sequences and at one position in the aligned rotavirus sequences (data not shown). Our current hypothesis is that the reovirus RNA guanylyltransferase and perhaps also the RNA guanylyltransferases of other viruses in this family represent a distinct class of these enzymes. Clearly, biochemical and mutational analyses, as performed for mammalian reovirus λ2 in this study, are required to identify the active-site residues in the RNA guanylyltransferases of the other Reoviridae family members. Mammalian reovirus, a multisegmented double-stranded RNA virus in the family Reoviridae, replicates in the cytoplasm of the eukaryotic host cell. The reovirus core particle can producem7NGpppGm2′OpC(pN)n-OH (cap 1) plus-strand RNA from each genomic double-stranded RNA segment in vitro (1.Furuichi Y. Muthukrishnan S. Tomasz J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5043-5053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that it contains all of the enzymes necessary for de novo synthesis of capped mRNA. The RNA polymerase itself is likely to be the λ3 core protein (2.Bruenn J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 18: 217-226Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 3.Starnes M.C. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1993; 193: 356-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Genetic and/or biochemical analyses indicate that the λ1 and μ2 core proteins have nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase activity, possibly associated with an RNA helicase (4.Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7728-7735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Bisaillon M. Bergeron J. Lemay G. J. Biol.

The γ phosphate of the newly transcribed mRNA is thought to be removed by the RNA triphosphate phosphohydrolase activity of λ1 (7.Bisaillon M. Lemay G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29954-29957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The λ2 core protein is the reovirus RNA guanylyltransferase, which adds a GMP moiety via a 5′–5′ linkage to the 5′-diphosphorylated mRNA (8.Cleveland D.R. Zarbl H. Millward S. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 307-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This transfer reaction occurs through a covalent intermediate, a phosphoamide bond between the GMP of the donor GTP and a lysine of λ2 (9.Shatkin A.J. Furuichi Y. LaFiandra A.J. Yamakawa M. Compans R.W. Bishop D.J.L. Double-stranded RNA Viruses. Elsevier, New York1983: 43-54Google Scholar, 10.Fausnaugh J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7669-7672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of this covalent bond (called “autoguanylylation” in this paper) is followed by GMP transfer from the enzyme to an acceptor, usually the 5′-diphosphorylated mRNA, although the GMP can be alternatively transferred to a 5′-triphosphorylated RNA or a di- or triphosphorylated nucleoside (11.Mao Z. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1991; 185: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The resulting product is then sequentially methylated by RNA nucleoside-7-N- and 2′-O-methyltransferases, yielding the cap 1 mRNA (1.Furuichi Y. Muthukrishnan S. Tomasz J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5043-5053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that is released through the channel formed by the λ2 pentameric spike (12.Barlett N.M. Gillies S.C. Bullivant S. Bellamy A.R. J. Virol. 1974; 167: 315-326Crossref Google Scholar, 13.Yeager M. Weiner S. Coombs K.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70 (abstr.): 116Google Scholar). Both of the methyltransferase activities appear to reside in λ2 as indicated by the finding that only the λ2 protein in cores is covalently labeled with the methyl donor S-adenosyl-l-methionine after incubation and UV cross-linking (14.Luongo C.L. Contreras C.M. Farsetta D.L. Nibert M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23773-23780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, λ2 is thought to catalyze the last three of the four reactions required for cap 1 formation on reovirus mRNA. The 144-kDa λ2 protein (15.Seliger L.S. Zheng K. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16289-16293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), encoded by the reovirus L2 gene, appears to contain multiple domains. The proposed guanylyltransferase active site (lysine 226) is near the amino terminus (10.Fausnaugh J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7669-7672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is anS-adenosyl-l-methionine-binding site that appears to span residues 827 and 829 (14.Luongo C.L. Contreras C.M. Farsetta D.L. Nibert M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23773-23780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16.Koonin E.V. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A carboxyl-terminalM r 25,000 region is expendable for capping functions but is implicated in anchoring the reovirus cell attachment protein ς1 in virions (17.Dryden K.A. Wang G. Yeager M. Nibert M.L. Coombs K.M. Furlong D.B. Fields B.N. Baker T.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1023-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 18.Luongo C.L. Dryden K.A. Farsetta D.L. Margraf R.M. Severson T.F. Olson N.H. Fields B.N. Baker T.S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8035-8040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A multidomain structure for the λ2 protein is also consistent with what is known for other capping enzymes. The vaccinia virus capping enzyme that catalyzes the first three reactions required for cap 1 formation is a heterodimer composed of two subunits encoded by separate genes (19.Martin S.A. Paoletti E. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9322-9329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Morgan J.R. Cohen L.K. Roberts B.E. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 206-214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Niles E.G. Lee-Chen G.J. Shuman S. Moss B. Broyles S.S. Virology. 1989; 172: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). By biochemical analysis of proteolytic products, the capping enzyme is separable into a region with RNA triphosphate phosphohydrolase and guanylyltransferase activity and a region with RNA nucleoside-7-N-methyltransferase activity (22.Higman M.A. Bourgeois N. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16430-16437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9690-9695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TheSaccharomyces cerevisiae capping enzyme is a complex of two separate gene products (24.Shibagaki Y. Itoh N. Yamada H. Shibekazu N. Mizumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9521-9528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), one having RNA triphosphate phosphohydrolase and the other having RNA guanylyltransferase activity (25.Itoh N. Yamada H. Kaziro Y. Mizumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1989-1995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two examples suggest that capping enzymes can be multifunctional and that the guanylyltransferase region may be separated biochemically (vaccinia virus) or genetically (yeast) from the rest of the protein. In the case of the Chlorella virus PBCV-1, the RNA guanylyltransferase is a 330-amino acid monofunctional enzyme (26.Ho C.K. van Etten J.L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6658-6664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The small size of this guanylyltransferase and the guanylyltransferase regions of the other capping enzymes suggests that only a portion of the 144-kDa λ2 protein is likely to be required for its RNA guanylyltransferase activity. For most RNA guanylyltransferases, a KXDG active-site motif has been proposed based on sequence comparisons (27.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Fresco L.D. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6624-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29.Wang S.P. Deng L. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9573-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For the RNA guanylyltransferases of vaccinia virus, S. cerevisiae, and baculovirus, the identity of the active site has been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis (27.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Schwer B. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4328-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31.Jin J. Dong W. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10011-10019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the PBCV-1 RNA guanylyltransferase, crystallographic analysis indicates that the active-site lysine interacts with the substrate GTP and that the other residues of the consensus motif interact with the RNA or nucleotide acceptor (32.Håkansson K. Doherty A.J. Shuman S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 33.Håkansson K. Wigley D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1505-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The RNA guanylyltransferases, as well as RNA and DNA ligases, are members of the RNA/DNA nucleotidyltransferase superfamily (27.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Fresco L.D. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6624-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29.Wang S.P. Deng L. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9573-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), enzymes that mediate nucleotidyl transfer to RNA or DNA via a covalent intermediate. The active-site motif for this entire superfamily is KX(D/N)G (27.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Fresco L.D. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6624-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29.Wang S.P. Deng L. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9573-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The RNA guanylyltransferases of members of the family Reoviridaelack sequences that precisely match this consensus motif (15.Seliger L.S. Zheng K. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16289-16293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Bisaillon M. Lemay G. Virology. 1997; 236: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For example, the sequence of the proposed active site in the reovirus λ2 protein is 226KPTNG. This sequence is similar to the nucleotidyl transferase superfamily motif, but the alignment is disrupted by insertion of a proline residue after the lysine in λ2. The proposed guanylyltransferase active site for the other familyReoviridae members rotavirus (KPTGN) and bluetongue virus (KLTGN) is based on the proposed reovirus active site (34.Bisaillon M. Lemay G. Virology. 1997; 236: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A previous effort to identify the λ2 residue that forms the phosphoamide bond with GMP used a combination of proteolysis and chemical cleavage of reovirus virions autoguanylylated with [32P]GMP to show that a lysine residue in λ2 is the site of covalent linkage to GMP (10.Fausnaugh J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7669-7672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of proteolyzed, [32P]GMP-labeled reovirus particles with λ2 peptide-specific antibodies indirectly identified lysine 226 as the residue to which GMP is likely attached. A similar approach involving proteolysis and chemical cleavage identified the active-site lysine of the vaccinia virus guanylyltransferase (35.Niles E.G. Christen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24986-24989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the identity of the vaccinia virus active-site lysine was subsequently confirmed by the analysis of site-directed mutants for autoguanylylation activity (27.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To extend characterization of the reovirus RNA guanylyltransferase, we expressed recombinant λ2 and analyzed its properties. Utilizing a biochemical approach, we localized a region necessary and sufficient for guanylyltransferase activity to an amino-terminal M r 42,000 fragment of λ2. Since this region contains lysine 226, we generated mutant K226A by alanine substitution. Analysis of the mutant indicated that lysine 226 is not necessary for λ2 guanylyltransferase activity. Alanine substitution for other lysines in the M r 42,000 region identified lysine 190 as the probable site of covalent GMP linkage and lysine 171 as important for autoguanylylation activity. Based on these findings, we propose a novel active-site motif for the RNA guanylyltransferases of mammalian reoviruses and otherReoviridae family members. DISCUSSIONOur rλ2 protein expressed in insect cells from a baculovirus vector has guanylyltransferase activity using either GDP or GTP as GMP acceptor. In contrast to published observations with rλ2 expressed in mammalian cells from a vaccinia virus vector (11.Mao Z. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1991; 185: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), however, we were unsuccessful at demonstrating guanylyltransferase activity with baculovirus-expressed rλ2 using either 5′-diphosphorylated reovirus RNA or poly(A) RNA as acceptor (data not shown). Given this limitation in the activity of the baculovirus-expressed protein, which might be explained by a defect in allowing RNA molecules into the acceptor region of the enzyme, the conclusions we reach about amino acids required for GMP transfer must be considered as tentative with regard to RNA acceptors.Unlike core-associated λ2, rλ2 is hypersensitive to cleavage into complementary M r 42,000 and 100,000 fragments that dissociate in solution. Retention of both autoguanylylation and GMP transfer activities by the M r 42,000 fragment suggested that it is both necessary and sufficient to act as a guanylyltransferase. The M r 42,000 region contains the active site originally localized by direct biochemical analysis to the region between amino acids 131 and 266 (10.Fausnaugh J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7669-7672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further indirect biochemical analysis in the previous study identified lysine 226 as the active-site residue that forms a phosphoamide bond with GMP (10.Fausnaugh J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7669-7672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The previously identified active-site motif 226KPTNG in reovirus λ2 is anomalous for two reasons. First it is not conserved outside the family Reoviridae. Of the known nucleotidyl transferases, at least 13 RNA guanylyltransferases, 16 DNA ligases, and one RNA ligase have the motif KXDG (27.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Fresco L.D. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6624-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29.Wang S.P. Deng L. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9573-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 31.Jin J. Dong W. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10011-10019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two DNA ligases of African swine fever virus and the S. cerevisiaetRNA ligase have the motif KXNG (27.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Fresco L.D. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6624-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The second reason is that insertion of additional residues may interfere with noncovalent bonding of one of the substrates. Based on the structure of the PBCV-1 guanylyltransferase (32.Håkansson K. Doherty A.J. Shuman S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 33.Håkansson K. Wigley D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1505-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and the ATP-dependent DNA ligase of bacteriophage T7 (44.Subramanya H.S. Doherty A.J. Ashford S.R. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1996; 85: 607-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), the lysine in the active-site motif covalently binds GMP or AMP, respectively, and the remaining residues interact with the nucleotide acceptor in RNA for PBCV-1 or the ATP for T7 DNA ligase.As was done for the vaccinia virus RNA guanylyltransferase (27.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we chose to confirm the identity of the active-site lysine in reovirus λ2 by site-directed mutagenesis. Since alanine substitution has been used to identify the active-site lysine of the RNA guanylyltransferase of S. cerevisiae (30.Schwer B. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4328-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and baculovirus (31.Jin J. Dong W. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10011-10019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we generated the λ2 mutant K226A. Based on the demonstrable guanylyltransferase activity of this mutant, we concluded that lysine 226 is not the active-site residue. This conclusion has ramifications for the guanylyltransferases of the other members of the double-stranded RNA virus family Reoviridae and brings into question the functional significance of the similar motifs recently identified in the rotavirus and bluetongue virus RNA guanylyltransferases (34.Bisaillon M. Lemay G. Virology. 1997; 236: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).In addition to lysine 226, the M r 42,000 region contains seven lysines at positions 44, 89, 94, 171, 190, 197, and 372 (15.Seliger L.S. Zheng K. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16289-16293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A series of six alanine substitution mutants were generated to identify the active-site residue. Lysines 44, 89, and 94 are not necessary for activity, based on mutants K44A, K89A, and K94A having approximately wild type levels of autoguanylylation activity. Lysine 197, like lysine 226, is not necessary for activity but affects the level of autoguanylylation. These two residues may function to stabilize the structure of the active site or the bound GTP, consistent with K226A having decreased autoguanylylation activity while maintaining wild type levels of GMP transfer. Lysine 171 is likely to be critical for substrate binding, since K171A showed less than 1% of wild type autoguanylylation activity. Based on the severe defect in autoguanylylation of the K190A mutant, lysine 190 is proposed to be necessary for activity and to be the active-site residue for formation of the phosphoamide bond.Lysine 190 in the reovirus λ2 protein is in a sequence context, KDLS, that lacks similarity with the consensus active-site motif (KXDG) of the well characterized class of eukaryotic and viral RNA guanylyltransferases (27.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Fresco L.D. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6624-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29.Wang S.P. Deng L. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9573-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This lack of similarity suggests that the λ2 active site may be formed via a novel protein fold. Sequences similar to the λ2 KDLS sequence were found to be widely conserved among the RNA guanylyltransferases of otherReoviridae family members within the genera Rotavirus, Orbivirus, and Phytoreovirus (data not shown) and may suggest that the enzymes from these other viruses share a novel active-site motif with reovirus λ2. Additionally, the consensus sequence KXDG is not strictly conserved among the RNA guanylyltransferases of any of these viruses, although KXXG motifs are conserved at two positions in the aligned orbivirus sequences and at one position in the aligned rotavirus sequences (data not shown). Our current hypothesis is that the reovirus RNA guanylyltransferase and perhaps also the RNA guanylyltransferases of other viruses in this family represent a distinct class of these enzymes. Clearly, biochemical and mutational analyses, as performed for mammalian reovirus λ2 in this study, are required to identify the active-site residues in the RNA guanylyltransferases of the other Reoviridae family members. Our rλ2 protein expressed in insect cells from a baculovirus vector has guanylyltransferase activity using either GDP or GTP as GMP acceptor. In contrast to published observations with rλ2 expressed in mammalian cells from a vaccinia virus vector (11.Mao Z. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1991; 185: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), however, we were unsuccessful at demonstrating guanylyltransferase activity with baculovirus-expressed rλ2 using either 5′-diphosphorylated reovirus RNA or poly(A) RNA as acceptor (data not shown). Given this limitation in the activity of the baculovirus-expressed protein, which might be explained by a defect in allowing RNA molecules into the acceptor region of the enzyme, the conclusions we reach about amino acids required for GMP transfer must be considered as tentative with regard to RNA acceptors. Unlike core-associated λ2, rλ2 is hypersensitive to cleavage into complementary M r 42,000 and 100,000 fragments that dissociate in solution.

The M r 42,000 region contains the active site originally localized by direct biochemical analysis to the region between amino acids 131 and 266 (10.Fausnaugh J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol.

Further indirect biochemical analysis in the previous study identified lysine 226 as the active-site residue that forms a phosphoamide bond with GMP (10.Fausnaugh J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol.

The two DNA ligases of African swine fever virus and the S. cerevisiaetRNA ligase have the motif KXNG (27.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol.

As was done for the vaccinia virus RNA guanylyltransferase (27.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we chose to confirm the identity of the active-site lysine in reovirus λ2 by site-directed mutagenesis. Since alanine substitution has been used to identify the active-site lysine of the RNA guanylyltransferase of S. cerevisiae (30.Schwer B. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4328-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and baculovirus (31.Jin J. Dong W. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10011-10019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we generated the λ2 mutant K226A. Based on the demonstrable guanylyltransferase activity of this mutant, we concluded that lysine 226 is not the active-site residue. This conclusion has ramifications for the guanylyltransferases of the other members of the double-stranded RNA virus family Reoviridae and brings into question the functional significance of the similar motifs recently identified in the rotavirus and bluetongue virus RNA guanylyltransferases (34.Bisaillon M.

In addition to lysine 226, the M r 42,000 region contains seven lysines at positions 44, 89, 94, 171, 190, 197, and 372 (15.Seliger L.S. Zheng K. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16289-16293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A series of six alanine substitution mutants were generated to identify the active-site residue. Lysines 44, 89, and 94 are not necessary for activity, based on mutants K44A, K89A, and K94A having approximately wild type levels of autoguanylylation activity. Lysine 197, like lysine 226, is not necessary for activity but affects the level of autoguanylylation. These two residues may function to stabilize the structure of the active site or the bound GTP, consistent with K226A having decreased autoguanylylation activity while maintaining wild type levels of GMP transfer. Lysine 171 is likely to be critical for substrate binding, since K171A showed less than 1% of wild type autoguanylylation activity. Based on the severe defect in autoguanylylation of the K190A mutant, lysine 190 is proposed to be necessary for activity and to be the active-site residue for formation of the phosphoamide bond.

Sequences similar to the λ2 KDLS sequence were found to be widely conserved among the RNA guanylyltransferases of otherReoviridae family members within the genera Rotavirus, Orbivirus, and Phytoreovirus (data not shown) and may suggest that the enzymes from these other viruses share a novel active-site motif with reovirus λ2. Additionally, the consensus sequence KXDG is not strictly conserved among the RNA guanylyltransferases of any of these viruses, although KXXG motifs are conserved at two positions in the aligned orbivirus sequences and at one position in the aligned rotavirus sequences (data not shown). Our current hypothesis is that the reovirus RNA guanylyltransferase and perhaps also the RNA guanylyltransferases of other viruses in this family represent a distinct class of these enzymes. Clearly, biochemical and mutational analyses, as performed for mammalian reovirus λ2 in this study, are required to identify the active-site residues in the RNA guanylyltransferases of the other Reoviridae family members.

The complex is involved in the tethering of coat protomer I vesicles to Golgi membranes and the initial stacking of reforming cisternae. Here we show that the NH2-terminal 15% of Giantin suffices to bind p115 in vitro and in vivo and to block cell-free Golgi reassembly. Because Giantin is a long, rod-like protein anchored to the membrane by its extreme COOH terminus, these results support the idea of a long, flexible tether linking vesicles and cisternae.

Correct intracellular transport demands that both COPI and COPII vesicles are targeted to and fuse with specific membranes. Membrane fusion requires NSF, a set of soluble proteins, the SNAPs, and pairing between two sets of cognate proteins, the SNAREs, one set being on the vesicle (v-SNARE), the other on the target membrane (t-SNARE) (14.Söllner T.

In vitro studies employing yeast vacuoles suggest that after SNARE pairing a phosphatase-dependent (24.Xu Z. Sato K. Wickner W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1125-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent step (25.Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) are required for fusion. It has become increasingly clear that before SNARE pairing COP vesicles become tethered to target membranes. Tethering is thought to be mediated by rod-like proteins with extensive coiled-coil (23.Pfeffer S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E17-E22Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 26.Clague M.J. Curr.

One such protein is p115, which was identified originally because it is required for transport within the Golgi apparatus (29.Waters M.G. Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was implicated in fusion of transcytotic vesicles with the plasma membrane (30.Barroso M. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and in docking COPI vesicles to Golgi membranes (31.Sönnichsen B. Lowe M. Levine T. Jämsä E. Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The p115 yeast homolog, Uso1p, is involved in endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport (32.Nakajima H. Hirata A. Ogawa Y. Yonehara T. Yoda K. Yamasaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and is essential for docking of endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles (33.Cao X.C. Ballew N. Barlowe C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2156-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Both proteins form dimers with two globular heads, a long coiled-coil domain and a short acidic tail (34.Yamakawa H. Seog D.H. Yoda K. Yamasaki M. Wakabayashi T. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,35.Sapperstein S.K. Walter D.M. Grosvenor A.R. Heuser J.E. Waters M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Further understanding of p115 function came from studying the Golgi apparatus during the cell cycle. During interphase p115 binds Golgi membranes via the Golgi matrix protein GM130 (36.Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). At the onset of mitosis cdc2/cyclin B phosphorylates GM130, and this inhibits the binding of p115 to the Golgi apparatus in vitro (36.Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 37.Lowe M. Rabouille C. Nakamura N. Watson R. Jackman M. Jämsä E. Rahman D. Pappin D.J. Warren G.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1211-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This may explain the extensive vesiculation of the Golgi complex observed during mitosis (40.Lucocq J.M. Warren G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3239-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 41.Lucocq J.M. Berger E.G. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 42.Warren G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 323-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The loss of p115 would prevent the tethering and hence fusion of COPI vesicles. Continued budding in the absence of fusion would help to vesiculate the Golgi apparatus (42.Warren G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 323-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 43.Warren G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1985; 10: 439-443Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 44.Warren G. Levine T. Misteli T. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 413-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Another receptor for p115 is Giantin (31.Sönnichsen B. Lowe M. Levine T. Jämsä E. Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 36.Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In addition to residing on Golgi membranes, Giantin is also incorporated into budding COPI vesicles (31.Sönnichsen B. Lowe M. Levine T. Jämsä E. Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), whereas GM130 is largely excluded. In vitrobinding experiments showed that p115 binds Giantin on COPI vesicles and GM130 on Golgi membranes. It has therefore been suggested that p115 tethers COPI vesicles by connecting GM130 on the Golgi membrane to Giantin on the COPI vesicle (31.Sönnichsen B. Lowe M. Levine T. Jämsä E. Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Experiments employing a Golgi reassembly assay (45.Misteli T. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 269-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 46.Rabouille C. Misteli T. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) lend support to this idea. They showed that p115, GM130, and Giantin play a crucial role in Golgi cisternal regrowth (47.Rabouille C. Levine T.P. Peters J.M. Warren G. Cell. 1995; 82: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), and more recently they have been implicated in stacking Golgi cisternae (48.Shorter J. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because tethers operate before SNARE pairing (33.Cao X.C. Ballew N. Barlowe C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2156-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), one could imagine that they act at a greater distance. They would perhaps allow the vesicle to sample the membrane before bringing it closer to permit v- and t-SNARE interaction. Such a sampling function would be critically dependent on the length of the tethering complex. Both GM130 and Giantin appear to be long, rod-like proteins. GM130 is about 50 nm in length by negative staining, 2M. Lowe, R. Newman, and G. Warren, unpublished observation. whereas Giantin has a predicted length, based on sedimentation analysis, of 250 nm (49.Linstedt A.D. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 50.Linstedt A.D. Foguet M. Renz M. Seelig H.P. Glick B.S. Hauri H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5102-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GM130 binds to Golgi membranes at its COOH-terminal end and to p115 at its NH2-terminal end. Giantin is anchored by its COOH terminus to the membrane, but the binding site for p115 has not been mapped. Given the importance of this site in conceptualizing the tethering complex we have mapped the p115 binding site on Giantin and analyzed its properties in vitro and in vivo. The following antibodies were used in this study: mouse monoclonal 4H1 against p115 (29.Waters M.G. Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), mouse monoclonal against GM130 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), rabbit polyclonal anti-myc tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Texas Red-X goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes). Proteins were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 4 min, and analyzed on 6, 10, or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (51.Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, proteins were transferred onto Hybond C blots (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) using a semidry blotter. Blocking and antibody incubations were performed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% (w/v) low fat skim milk powder and 2% (v/v) polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20). Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase conjugates (Tago, Buckingam, U. K.) and were detected with an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The construct used for in vitro transcription/translation of full-length Giantin was pGCP364/pSG5, kindly provided by Dr. Y. Ikehara (Fukuoka University, Japan). pGCP364/pSG5 contains the full-length cDNA of rat Giantin cloned into the EcoRI restriction site of the eukaryotic expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Gtn450–3187 was obtained by in vitrotranscription/translation of pGL88, which contains an ∼8.5-kbXbaI fragment from pGCP364/pSG5 in the cloning vector pSTBlue-1 (Novagen, Madison, WI) oriented with its 5′-end toward the T7 promoter. Plasmids encoding for Gtn448, Gtn105–448, Gtn186, Gtn293–448, Gtn301, and Gtn187–448 were obtained by PCR using primers with BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites, the high fidelity DNA polymerase Pfu turbo (Stratagene), and pGCP364/pSG5 as a template. Each PCR product was subcloned in pBluescript II (Stratagene) between the restriction sitesBamHI and EcoRI and sequenced by the I.C.R.F. sequencing facility using an Applied Biosystems Prism 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT). Gtn448 was translated in vitrofrom pGL108, which contains the NH2-terminal 1.3 kb of the rat Giantin cDNA. This fragment was obtained using the primers GL2, 5′-CTCAGCTCCTCCAGCGAATTCGAACTAAGGAGCAAGG-3′, and GL48, 5′-CCATGGAGCGCTCCTGGATCCATGCTGAGCCG-3′. To translate Gtn105–448in vitro we made pGL100 using the primers GL2 and GL61, 5′-CTTCATGCAAAGGCCGGATCCATGTCCTTGAACAAACAA-3′. To obtain Gtn186 we made pGL109 (primers GL48 and GL58, 5′-CTGCCTCATCAGCTAGAATTCCTCCATCTCCGC-3′). We translated Gtn293–448in vitro from pGL102 (primers GL2 and GL63, 5′-CTGATGGAAAAGGTAGGATCCGAAATGGCAGAGAGG-3′), Gtn301 from pGL101 (primers GL48 and GL62, 5′-CTCCAACTGTCCCTAGAATTCATACAGCTCTTC-3′), and Gtn187–448 from pGL110 (primers GL2 and GL59, 5′-GCGGAGATGGAGGGATCCATCCTGATGAGGCAG-3′). Gtn448, Gtn1967–2541, and Gtn1125–1695 were obtained as His6-tagged recombinant proteins in bacteria. To express Gtn448, a PCR fragment was obtained using Pfu turbo DNA polymerase and the primers GL1, 5′-CCATGGAGCGCTCCTGGTACCATGCTGAGCCG-3′, and GL2 and subcloned in the prokaryotic expression vector pTrcHis (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) between the restriction sites KpnI and EcoRI, generating pGL70. A ∼1.7-kb KpnI-HindIII fragment encoding amino acids 1967–2541 and a ∼1.7-kbHindIII fragment encoding amino acids 1125–1695 were obtained by restriction digestion of pGCP364/pSG5 and subcloned in pTrcHis to generate pTrc#1 and pTrc#2, respectively. The joins between the histidine tag and Giantin fragments and the following 300–500 base pairs at the 3′-end were sequenced. The construct used to express Gtn448 in normal rat kidney cells was pGL140, which was made in the following way. We excised a ∼1.35-kbKpnI-EcoRI fragment from pGL70 encoding Gtn448, and we subcloned it in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). We then inserted the PCR-generated 9E10 myc tag sequence (53.Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) between the restriction sites NheI and KpnI. To express Gtn1125–1695 we constructed pGL142. We used Pfuturbo DNA polymerase to PCR amplify a ∼1.7-kb fragment from pGCP364/pSG5 using primers GL98, 5′-GACTCAGGATCCAATGAAGCTTCAAGAAGCCTTAATTTCC-3′, which contains aBamHI restriction site and a starting codon, and GL99, 5′-CCTGAGCTTCTACCTGAGAATTCAGATTACGAGTCTCTTC-3′, which contains anEcoRI restriction site. We cloned this fragment in pcDNA3.1(+), BamHI-EcoRI. We then inserted the myc tag sequence between KpnI and BamHI to obtain pGL142. To express Gtn1967–2541 we made pGL141. We usedPfu turbo DNA polymerase to amplify a ∼1.7-kb fragment from pGCP364/pSG5 using primers GL37, 5′-CCGAGCTCGAGATCGGATCCATGTACCTCGGCAGGATCAGTGCC-3′, which contains aBamHI restriction site and a starting codon, and GL97, 5′-CAACTGCTCCTTGGAATTCTTGATCTCTTTAGACAAACC-3′, which contains anEcoRI restriction site. We cloned this fragment in pcDNA3.1(+), BamHI-EcoRI. This mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. We then inserted the myc tag sequence between KpnI and BamHI to obtain pGL141. To express Gtn450–3187 we made pGL147. We used the Quickchange kit (Stratagene) to insert a stop codon in pGL88, which eliminated the last 24 amino acids of Giantin, including its transmembrane domain. We then subcloned the BamHI-NotI ∼8.1-kb fragment from this construct in pcDNA3.1(+) with a myc tag betweenKpnI and BamHI, to generate pGL147. Constructs for in vitro transcription/translation were in pSG5 (Stratagene) for full-length Giantin, in pSTBlue-1 (Novagen) for Gtn450–3187, and in pBluescript II for all other Giantin fragments. 50-μl reactions were performed using a T7 RNA polymerase kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI) using 1 μg of plasmid DNA, the amino acid mix without methionine, and 4 μl ofl-[35S]methionine, 10 mCi/ml (ICN Biomedicals, Basingstoke, U. K.). Reactions were incubated for 2–4 h at 30 °C, and 5 μl of each reaction was used for binding experiments. Native p115 was purified from rat liver cytosol (29.Waters M.G. Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 38.Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Kieckbusch R.H. Warren G. J. Biol.

All three proteins were biotinylated using sulfo-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide-long chain biotin (Pierce) for 2 h on ice (20 mol of biotin/mol of protein) and incubated with Ultralink immobilized neutravidin or streptavidin beads (Pierce) (0.3–1 μg of biotinylated protein/μl of beads) in HKTD buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed with HKTD buffer and incubated, in the presence of protease inhibitors, with rat liver Golgi membranes (100 μg of protein) prepared as described in Ref. 54.Hui N. Nakamura N. Slusarewicz P. Warren G. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook.2. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 46-55Google Scholar and solubilized in buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, rat liver cytosol (100 μg) at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and cleared by centrifugation, p115 (2 μg), Gtn448 (2 μg), Gtn1125–1695 (2 μg), or with 5 μl ofin vitro translated protein along with bovine serum albumin as a carrier protein for 1–2 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed three times with HKTD buffer and either boiled in sample buffer or incubated with elution buffer (HKTD buffer with KCl added to 1m). Eluted proteins were then precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by Coomassie Blue or silver staining. For experiments involving in vitro translated proteins we used a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) for analysis. Protein identification was done starting from zinc-imidazole-SDS reversed stained gels (55.Fernandez-Patron C. Calero M. Collazo P.R. Garcia J.R. Madrazo J. Musacchio A. Soriano F. Estrada R. Frank R. Castellanos-Serra L.R. Mendez E. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Protein bands were excised, in gel digested with trypsin, and the generated peptides were analyzed by MALDI–time-of-flight mass spectrometry using a Bruker Reflex III instrument (Bruker Instruments Inc. Bremen, Germany) operating under delayed extraction conditions. Proteins were first identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using an aliquot of the complete digestion mixture (56.Pappin D.J.C. Hojrup P. Bleasby A.J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 327-332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). Protein assignments were confirmed further by selecting a well resolved peptide ion from which post-source decay fragments were recorded using the reflectron mode (57.Gevaert K. Demol H. Sklyarova T. Vandekerckhove J. Houthaeve T. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The information contained in these post-source decay spectra was subject to a search in a nonredundant protein data base or an expressed sequence tags data base using the SEQUEST algorithm (58.Griffin P.R. MacCoss M.J. Eng J.K. Blevins R.A. Aaronson J.S. Yates 3rd, J.R. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 9: 1546-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This analysis confirmed our previous assignment. Normal rat kidney cells were microinjected using the Eppendorf Transjector 55246 and the Eppendorf Micromanipulator 5171 (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) in conjunction with a Zeiss Axiovert-10 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkoken, Germany). Plasmid DNA (pGL140, pGL141, pGL142, or pGL147) was injected into nuclei at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. After injection the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h, then fixed and permeabilized with cold methanol and incubated with the following antibodies: monoclonal 4H1 (against p115), monoclonal antibody against GM130, or polyclonal anti-myc tag, followed by the secondary antibodies Texas Red-X goat anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit. Coverslips were then mounted in Moviol 4–88 (Harco, Harlow, U. K.). Fluorescence analysis was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert-135TV microscope, and images were captured on a cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ). Images were analyzed using IPLab Spectrum V3.1 software (Signals Analytics Corp., Vienna, VA). The Golgi reassembly assay was performed essentially as in Ref. 48.Shorter J. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar. Rat liver Golgi membranes and HeLa mitotic cytosol were prepared as described previously (54.Hui N. Nakamura N. Slusarewicz P.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1411-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Mitotic Golgi fragments were generated by incubating rat liver Golgi membranes with mitotic cytosol for 20 min at 37 °C. The mitotic Golgi fragments were recovered by centrifugation through a 0.5 msucrose cushion (48.Shorter J. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and subsequently preincubated on ice for 15 min with either Giantin fragment buffer (20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm magnesium acetate, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol), Gtn448, or Gtn1967–2541 to achieve a final concentration of Giantin fragment of 3.25 μm in the reassembly reaction. In some experiments increasing concentrations of Gtn448 were used to pretreat the mitotic Golgi fragments. The pretreated mitotic Golgi fragments were then resuspended at 0.75 μg/μl with NSF (100 ng/μl; final concentration), α-SNAP (25 ng/μl), γ-SNAP (25 ng/μl), p115 (30 ng/μl), and an ATP regeneration system in a final reaction volume of 20 μl and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Reactions were then fixed and processed for electron microscopy (46.Rabouille C. Misteli T. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and the amount of cisternal regrowth determined (36.Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The p115 binding site on Giantin was mapped by generating NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal deletions of the protein as well as internal fragments (see Fig. 1). These were generated by in vitro transcription/translation using [35S]methionine as the label and then tested for binding to p115 immobilized by biotinylation and binding to streptavidin or neutravidin beads. As shown in Fig.2 A, full-length Giantin bound to p115 beads but not to control beads. Removal of the first 448 amino acids was sufficient to abolish most of this binding. In contrast, the first 448 amino acids alone were sufficient to bind p115 almost as well as the full-length protein. Quantitation from two experiments gave a binding efficiency of 80% compared with the full-length protein. Further mapping within this region generated mostly inactive fragments (not shown; for a summary, see Fig. 1), although a fragment of the NH2-terminal 301 amino acids did bind weakly to p115 (about 25% compared with full-length Giantin; n = 2).Figure 2Association of full-length Giantin and Giantin fragments with p115. Panel A, coupled in vitro transcription/translation using [35S]methionine as the label was performed of plasmids encoding full-length Giantin (lanes 1–3), full-length Giantin lacking the NH2-terminal 449 residues (Gtn450–3187, lanes 4–6), the first 448 amino acids of Giantin (Gtn448, lanes 7–9), or the first 301 amino acids of Giantin (Gtn301, lanes 10–12). A fraction of each product was run alone (lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10), added to control beads (lanes 2,5, 8, and 11), or added to p115 beads (lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12). Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Lanes 1 and 4, 25% of total; lanes 7 and10, 10% of total; all other lanes, 100% of total. Panel B, coupled in vitrotranscription/translation using [35S]methionine as the label was performed of a plasmid encoding full-length Giantin, and the product was added to p115 beads (lanes 1, 3, and4) or control beads (lane 2) in the absence (lanes 1 and 2) or presence of a 25-fold molar excess of Gtn448 (lane 4) or a control Giantin fragment Gtn1125–1695 (lane 3). Bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Panel C, rat liver cytosol was cleared by centrifugation and then incubated with biotinylated Gtn448 immobilized on neutravidin beads or with control beads. The clarified cytosol (lane 1, 20% of total) and proteins bound to control beads (lane 2, 50% of total) or Gtn448 beads (lane 3, 50% of total) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and silver stained. p115 in lane 3 was identified using MALDI with electrospray mass spectrometry. Panel D, rat liver Golgi membranes were solubilized, cleared by centrifugation, and then incubated with biotinylated fragment Gtn448 immobilized on neutravidin beads or with control beads. The clarified Golgi extract (lanes 1 and 4, 20% of total) and proteins bound to control beads (lanes 2 and 5, 50% of total) or Gtn448 beads (lanes 3 and 6, 50% of total) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and either silver stained (lanes 1–3) or blotted with an anti-p115 antibody (lanes 4–6). Molecular mass markers are in kDa. Panel E, Gtn448 (lane 1), Gtn1125–1695 (lane 2), or p115 (lanes 5 and 8) was biotinylated and immobilized on neutravidin beads. These and control beads were incubated with purified p115 (lanes 1–3), Gtn448 (lanes 5 and6), or Gtn1125–1695 (lanes 8 and 9). Beads were washed and eluted with sample buffer.

https://openalex.org/W2144801767,"This report describes the use of the concept of inversion of hydropathy patterns to the de novo design of peptides targeted to a predetermined site on a protein. Eight- and 12-residue peptides were constructed with the EF hands or Ca2+-coordinating sites of calmodulin as their anticipated points of interaction. These peptides, but not unrelated peptides nor those with the same amino acid composition but a scrambled sequence, interacted with the two carboxyl-terminal Ca2+-binding sites of calmodulin as well as the EF hands of troponin C. The interactions resulted in a conformational change whereby the 8-mer peptide-calmodulin complex could activate phosphodiesterase in the absence of Ca2+. In contrast, the 12-mer peptide-calmodulin complex did not activate phosphodiesterase but rather inhibited activation by Ca2+. This inhibition could be overcome by high levels of Ca2+. Thus, it would appear that the aforementioned concept can be used to make peptide agonists and antagonists that are targeted to predetermined sites on proteins such as calmodulin.

Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 876-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, only the sequence location, not the identity, of the polar and nonpolar amino acids must be explicitly specified for the formation of a stable helical structure or biologically active peptide. Such binary coding has been successfully employed to produce biologically active analogs of corticotrophin and growth hormone-releasing hormone (2.Clarke B.L. Blalock J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9708-9711Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 3.Weigent D.A. Clarke B.L. Blalock J.E. ImmunoMethods. 1994; 5: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), to design proteins that fold into compact α-helical bundles (4.Kamtekar S. Schiffer J.M. Xiong H. Babik J.M. Hecht M. Science. 1993; 262: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), and to develop computer programs that simulate or predict some aspects of protein folding (5.Dill K.A. Bromberg S. Yue K. Fiebig K.M. Yee D.P. Thomas P.D. Chan H.S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 561-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). Considering that 20 different amino acids are encompassed by the binary code, one would expect a marked degree of sequence degeneracy for a given shape, since any one of a number of specific polar or nonpolar amino acids could occupy a given position in the sequence. Indeed, experimental evidence has confirmed that gross shape is degenerate with regard to sequence in that any number of different primary amino acid sequences with the same binary code can fold into compact α-helical structures (4.Kamtekar S. Schiffer J.M. Xiong H. Babik J.M. Hecht M. Science. 1993; 262: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). More recent studies have shown that, unlike simple helical structures, a five-letter amino acid alphabet is minimally required to build a well ordered, β-sheet containing protein architecture (6.Riddle D.S. Santiago J.V. Bray-Hall S.T. Doshi N. Grantcharova V.P. Yi Q. Baker D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In this particular instance, a small β-sheet protein, the SH3 domain, could be constructed with 95% of the residues being Ile, Lys, Glu, Ala, and Gly. Interestingly, the pattern of hydropathy of the wild type SH3 domain was largely maintained in the two sequence-simplified structures. 1M. Villain and J. E. Blalock, unpublished observations. This would seem once again to point to the importance of the pattern of hydropathy in building more complex structures as well as simple helical ones. If, as described above, the gross architecture of a peptide or protein is in part determined by its pattern of hydropathy, then exactly inverting a particular pattern or code may result in a second peptide or protein with a complementary surface contour to the first since the hydrophobic effect is involved yet in reversed orientation (for review see Ref. 1.Blalock J.E. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 876-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Inversion of the hydropathic pattern of one sequence relative to another can be achieved by computer programs designed for this task (7.Omichinski J.G. Olson A.D. Thorgeirsson S.S. Fassina G.

Res. Commun. 1981; 101: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In the later instance, since A and U are complementary and in the second codon position specify hydrophilic and hydrophobic R groups, respectively, and considering that second base G and C generally encode slightly hydrophilic R groups, amino acid sequences deciphered from noncoding strands of DNA will have exactly inverted patterns of hydropathy relative to those of coding strands (for review see Ref. 1.Blalock J.E. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 876-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Such peptides specified by complementary nucleotide sequences (11.Bost K.L. Smith E.M. Blalock J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1372-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) or designed by simply inverting the hydropathic pattern (8.Fassina G. Roller P.P. Olson A.D. Thorgeirsson S.S. Omichinski J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11252-11257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are termed complementary peptides and have characteristics suggestive of complementary structure. For instance, we and many others (for review see Refs. 1.Blalock J.E. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 876-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar and 12.Baranyi L. Campbell W. Ohshima K. Fujimoto S. Boros M. Okada H. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 894-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) have shown that in almost 40 different systems complementary peptides bind one another with specificity and moderate affinity. Additional evidence of complementary structure includes the following: the ability to locate the interactive sites of ligands and receptors by identification of complementary sequences (13.Crawford S.E.

Most recently, a novel hormone receptor was cloned, and its binding site was localized using this principle (17.Ruiz-Opazo N. Akimoto K. Herrera V.L.M. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1074-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Not unexpectedly, the aforementioned degeneracy that is observed for the relationship between sequence and structure applies to the complementary sequence since the same codes are operative. Thus a number of complementary peptides that are properly patterned are predicted to bind the appropriate target sequence. This has been previously observed (35.Blalock J.E. Bost K.L. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 36.Torres B.A. Johnson H.M. J.

The above results suggested that one could specifically target a complementary peptide to interact with a particular site(s) on a given protein. This was initially tested with an eight-residue complementary peptide (termed calcium-like peptide, CALP1) designed to interact with an EF hand motif based on the primordial Ca2+-binding site of the troponin C superfamily (38.Dillon J. Woods W.T. Guarcello V. LeBoeuf R.D. Blalock J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9726-9729Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Micromolar concentrations of CALP1 together with CaM,2 but neither CALP1 nor CaM alone, were found to activate phosphodiesterase in the absence of Ca2+. This demonstrated that the combination of CALP1 and CaM functioned similarly to a combination of Ca2+ and CaM. These results implied but did not prove that CALP1 directly interacted with CaM. Thus in the present studies we have sought evidence for direct binding of CALP1 to CaM, and we tested whether this occurs at or near the EF hands of CaM. Also, as a consequence of the CALP1 design being based on the primordial EF hand motif (38.Dillon J. Woods W.T. Guarcello V. LeBoeuf R.D. Blalock J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9726-9729Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 39.Demaille J.G. Calcium Cell Funct. 1982; 2: 111-144Crossref Google Scholar), the hydropathic profile of CALP1 is not perfectly inverted relative to the EF hand motifs of CaM. In the present study, we have designed a complementary peptide to invert more perfectly the pattern of hydropathy and to extend the sequence length to determine the role of these two factors on the interaction with CaM. Specifically, we synthesized a 12-mer peptide (CALP2; Table I) with an optimized and extended inverted hydropathic profile to EF hand motif 4 of human CaM using AMINOMAT® (Tecnogen, Italy) (40.Fassina G. Cassani G. Corti A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), a computer program able to determine the optimal complementary peptide sequence to a target. In order to distinguish if any increased affinity was due to the optimal hydropathic pattern or to the increased length or both, we also synthesized CALP3, which represents the first eight residues of CALP2, and CALP4, a 12-mer peptide identical to CALP1 in the first eight residues and CALP2 in the last four (Table I). We tested the binding characteristics of these peptides for CaM using three different approaches as follows: inhibition of complex formation between CaM and the EF hand-binding dye, Stains-all; changes in the emission spectra of dansylated CaM to monitor conformational changes; and real time measurement of the interaction with a biosensor based on surface plasmon resonance detection. We also characterized certain of the interactions with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and tested for CaM activation with a CaM-stimulated phosphodiesterase (PDE) assay. Finally, we tested the generality of the interaction by assessing the ability of CALP2 and -3 to bind the EF hands of another Ca2+-binding protein, troponin C.Table ICALP series and hydropathy plots* All peptides were synthesized as amino-terminal free amine and carboxyl-terminal free carboxylic acid. Open table in a new tab * All peptides were synthesized as amino-terminal free amine and carboxyl-terminal free carboxylic acid. In all the experiments, buffers were treated with the chelating resin Chelex 100. Stock solution of the peptides were checked for Ca2+ contamination by atomic absorption. Levels were always below 2 μm Ca2+/mm CALP. Thus, Ca2+ contamination was at most 200 nm and was usually 2–20 nm. These levels are below those required to affect any of the assays. Preloaded polyethylene glycol graft polystyrene,O-pentafluorophenyl ester amino acid, and 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole were purchased from Perspective Biosystems (Framingham, MA). High purity CaM from bovine brain and biotin-labeled calmodulin were purchased from Calbiochem. Its purity was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the identity verified by electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy (University of Alabama at Birmingham Core Facility). Neutravidin was from Pierce. D-CaM, PDE, MOPS, Chelex 100, and Stains-all were from Sigma.N,N-Dimethylformamide, DCM, and acetonitrile were purchased from Mallinckrodt (Paris, KY). Mant-cGMP was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other reagents were high purity grade obtained from Fisher or Sigma. Selection of the complementary peptide targeted to CaM EF hand 4 motif was carried out as described previously (40.Fassina G. Cassani G. Corti A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using the computer program AMINOMAT® (Tecnogen ScpA, Italy), with an averaging window r = 9, a range of inverted hydropathy of 0.8 and considering also the eight amino acids of the flanking regions. The program generated 1,417,176 possible sequences, and we chose the one with the lowest Q value (0.0068). This process resulted in a 12-residue peptide defined CALP2. CALP3 was generated by eliminating the four carboxyl-terminal amino acids of CALP2. CALP4 is a chimeric sequence carrying the eight amino acids of CALP1 with the addition at the carboxyl terminus of the four amino acids from the corresponding region of CALP2 (Table I). A scrambled version of CALP2 and peptides with sequences not related to the CALP series were used as negative controls. All the peptides were synthesized in our laboratory using continuous flow solid phase peptide synthesis with Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, on a PerSeptive Biosystems 9050 Peptide synthesizer. Pre-activatedO-pentafluorophenyl ester amino acids with 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole and preloaded polyethylene glycol graft polystyrene resin was used. All the peptides were purified by preparative RP-HPLC. The purity of the product was checked by analytical RP-HPLC. The identity of the peptides was confirmed by time of flight matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (University of Alabama at Birmingham Core Facility). CaM was suspended in water (300 μm final concentration) and aliquoted. All the peptides were suspended in a 3.3 mm MOPS solution, pH 7.2. Stains-all dye (60 μm) in ethyl glycerol was prepared fresh before each experiment, starting from a stock solution of 500 μm. All experiments were conducted using final concentrations of 1 μm CaM and 20 μm dye. Plastic tubes and the cuvette were washed with EGTA (0.2 m) and rinsed with Chelex water to remove any traces of Ca2+. For the assay 1.4 μl of CaM and different quantities of the peptides were added to 3.3 mm MOPS buffer to reach a final volume of 350 μl. The solutions were incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Ten minutes before reading, 150 μl of the dye solution was added and gently mixed. The spectra of the Stains-all·CaM complexes were recorded on a Shimadzu UV160 spectrophotometer between 400 and 700 nm. Data are presented as (A [ligand]/A [0] × 100) at 639 nm. D-CaM was solubilized in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0. Measurements were done in duplicate on a PTI fluorescence instrument equipped with a Delta ScanTM dual monochrometer illuminator (South Brunswick, NJ) with a fixed excitation wavelength of 340 nm and scanning the emission between 400 and 600 nm. EGTA (0.5 mm final concentration) was added to the D-CaM (200 nm) solution to reverse any Ca2+ contamination. Increasing amounts of the peptides or Ca2+ were added to the solution, and the increase in emission at 494 nm was measured. Intensity data were corrected for dilution. The data are presented as (Emission[ligand]/Emission[0]) × 100 at 490 nm. Direct measure of the affinities of the peptides for CaM were obtained using a surface plasmon resonance detector (IAsys, Affinity Sensor, Cambridge, UK). A carboxymethylated dextran cuvette was prepared immobilizing Neutravidin using an NHS/EDC activation procedure according to the manufacturer's protocols (IAsys protocol 1.1) This was followed by the attachment of biotin-labeled CaM to the Neutravidin on the cuvette. Binding buffer was 20 mm MOPS, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20 treated with Chelex 100. K d values were calculated using the software FASTfit, supplied by the manufacturers for the analysis of the binding curves. For the association, the curves were fitted to a single rate constant. For the dissociation we also used a single rate constant. The rabbit slow muscle troponin C mutants (C84S/Y111W, C84/R147W, and C84S/Y111W/R147W) were a gift of Dr. Herbert Cheung, and their preparation and characteristics are discussed elsewhere. 3W. J. Dong, J. M. Robinson, J. Xing, P. K. Umeda, and H. C. Cheung, submitted for publication. Steady state fluorescence for peptide-protein interaction were conducted using a ISS PC1 photo-counting fluorometer using a 0.1-mm slit. Protein was solubilized at 1 μm in 50 mm MOPS, 100 mm KCl, 50 μm EDTA, pH 7.2. Peptides were solubilized at a 3 mm stock concentration in this protein containing solution. By using 295 nm as the excitation wavelength, we measured the emission spectra between 300 and 400 nm with increasing concentration of the peptides. Spectra were recorded 5 min after addition of the peptide stocks. Acrylamide quenching of CALP2·TnC complex (75 and 1 μm, respectively) and of TnC (1 μm) were conducted in the same buffer, by the addition of aliquots of an 8 m acrylamide solution with λex = 295 nm and λem at the peak of the emission spectrum. In the range of acrylamide concentrations used (0–400 mm), we observed a linear relationship between tryptophan emission decay and quencher concentration. The quenching data were fitted to a modified Stern-Volmer equation,F 0/F = (1 +K SV [Q]); whereF 0 and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence of and presence of quencher, respectively; [Q] is the molar quencher concentration; andK SV is the Stern-Volmer dynamic quenching constant. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements were conducted as previously reported (42.Dong W.J. Wang C.K. Gordon A.M. Cheung H.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 850-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Transient kinetic measurements were performed on a Hi-Tech Scientific PQ/SF-53 stopped-flow spectrometer equipped as described (43.Dong W.J. Wang C.K. Gordon A.M. Rosenfeld S.S. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19229-19235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In a typical binding experiment, one syringe contained 10 μm C84S/R147W TnC or C84S/R147W TnC together with 50 μm CALP2 in 30 mm MOPS, 100 mmKCl, and 50 μm EGTA, pH 7.2. The protein was dialyzed against Chelex 100 resin before use. The other syringe contained 10 mm Ca2+ in the same buffer. CD studies were conducted on a 62 DS VCD spectrometer AVIV (Lakewood, NJ) using a 0.01-cm quartz cuvette, with a scanning range of 195–310 nm, a time constant of 2 s, and a scanning rate of 0.5 nm/s. The buffer used was 20 mmphosphate, pH 7.0 Measurements were obtained using a continuous fluorimetric assay based on Mant-cGMP. Mant-cGMP, a fluorescent derivative of cGMP, shows maximal fluorescence emission at 450 nm. Hydrolysis of Mant-cGMP by PDE in the presence of CaM and Ca2+ causes a decrease in the emission spectra of the compound. The enzymatic reaction can be followed in real time using 280 nm as excitation wavelength and monitoring the emitted light at 450 nm. Experiments were conducted using an excess of the substrate at fixed concentrations of CaM and PDE with constant mixing. By using these conditions the V max of the reaction can be calculated by the slope of the rectilinear part of the enzymatic reaction curve. Mant-cGMP was dissolved in MeOH (1.6 mm) and kept on ice. The reaction was conducted in 0.01 m MOPS, 0.09 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7, at 37 ± 2 °C. Mant-cGMP was diluted in the reaction buffer (8 μm final concentration) with CaM (5 nm) and the different peptides or free Ca2+. The system was equilibrated for 5 min. The reaction was followed using a PTI fluorescence instrument. The rate of the reaction was calculated with a linear regression of 150 data points after addition of PDE. Excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and emitted light was monitored at 450 nm, collecting 30 data points/min. The reaction was started by addition of PDE (0.05 units/ml). For Fig. 10, the percent inhibition was calculated using the formula: 100 − ((V max(pep) −V max(no Cam))/(V max(no peptide)− V max(no Cam))·100), whereV max(pep) is the rate of degradation of cGMP for a given Ca2+ concentration in presence of the peptides,V max(no peptide) is the rate of degradation for the same Ca2+ concentration without the peptides, andV max(no CaM) is the basal rate without CaM, defined as the basal activity of PDE. Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) harboring plasmid pRK7a for Drosophila melanogaster CaM was obtained from Dr. K. Beckingham (Rice University). Unlabeled CaM was expressed in cells grown in Terrific Broth, and 15N-labeled CaM was purified from cells grown in M9 medium using15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source. CaM (labeled and unlabeled) was purified by repeated chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose CL4B followed by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose using a linear gradient (0–0.5 m) of sodium chloride in 0.05 m sodium phosphate, pH 5.7. Under these conditions, CaM is obtained as a single peak, eluting at ∼0.35m NaCl. 15N-Labeled CaM tryptic fragments, TRC1 (amino-terminal domain) and TRC2 (carboxyl-terminal domain), were prepared as described previously (44.Andersson A. Forsen S. Thulin E. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2309-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 45.Vogel H.J. Lindahl L. Thulin E. FEBS Lett. 1983; 157: 241-246Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) except the purification of the two fragments was done by RP-HPLC on a Waters Delta Pack C18 300 A (300 × 39 mm inner diameter) column. The fragment identity was check by time of flight matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. NMR chemicals shift were consistent with the literature (46.Thulin E. Andersson A. Drakenberg T. Forsen S. Vogel H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 71: 1862-1870Google Scholar). Apocalmodulin samples were prepared by dissolving the sample in 3 ml of water and dialyzed against 2 changes of 1 m EDTA, 1 mm urea, pH 7.8, (2 times) followed by 0.5 m KCl (2 times), 0.25 m KCl (2 times), and deionized, distilled water (3 times). NMR samples were prepared by dissolving the protein sample in either 100% D2O (Cambridge Isotopes, MA) or 90% H2O, 10% D2O. The pH was adjusted using 0.1 mm DCl or 0.1 mm NaOD solutions. Concentrated peptide sample (2.0 mm CALP1 or 4.0 mm CALP3) solutions were prepared, the pH was adjusted and then titrated into the protein samples. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were acquired using a 12 ppm spectral width and presaturation of the HOD resonance. These spectra were acquired on either a Bruker WH400 or a Bruker AM600 instrument. The spectra were processing by Felix (MSI, San Diego, CA). Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC (47.Bodenhausen G. Ruben D.J. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1980; 69: 185-189Crossref Scopus (2435) Google Scholar) data were acquired on the Bruker AM600 instrument. The spectra were acquired with 12 ppm spectral width, 2048 complex t 2 points, and 512 t 1 points. All measurements were made at 298 K. Spectra were processed using Felix 95.0 (MSI, San Diego, CA), by zero filling to 2 by 2K data sets. Solvent suppression and first point correction were used for each spectra. A 45° shifted sinebell apodization function was applied in each dimension. By using a biosensor based on surface plasmon resonance detection, we were able to measure the real time interaction of CALP1 and CALP2 with CaM (Fig.1). This binding was specific in that free CaM (25 μm) in the binding buffer completely inhibited the interaction (data not shown). When the binding curves were analyzed with the computer program Fast-Fit, using a first order kinetic equation, CALP1 and CALP2 were found to have dissociation constant (K d) for CaM of 88 and 7.9 μm, respectively (Fig. 1). Thus, optimizing the pattern of inverted hydropathy and increasing the complementary peptide length from 8 to 12 residues resulted in a 11-fold increase in affinity. The binding that was observed by surface plasmon resonance detection could be due to CALP interaction with the EF hands of CaM or its hydrophobic core or both. Based on the following, it is unlikely that CALP is simply a binding peptide for the hydrophobic pocket of CaM. First, our CALP peptides don't match any of the Block consensus patterns for CaM-binding motifs (48.Henikoff J.G. Henikoff S. Pietrokovski S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 226-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 49.Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Genomics. 1994; 19: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (347)"

ICRF-193 is a catalytic inhibitor of topoisomerase II that is known to trap a closed-clamp intermediate form of the enzyme. Using steady-state and rapid kinetic ATPase and DNA transport assays, we have analyzed how trapping this intermediate by the drug perturbs the topoisomerase II mechanism. The drug has no effect on the rate of the first turnover of decatenation but potently inhibits subsequent turnovers with an IC50 of 6.5 ± 1 μm for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme. This drug inhibits the ATPase activity of topoisomerase II by an unusual, mixed-type mechanism; the drug is not a competitive inhibitor of ATP, and even at saturating concentrations of drug, the enzyme continues to hydrolyze ATP, albeit at a reduced rate. Topoisomerase II that was specifically isolated in the drug-bound, closed-clamp form continues to hydrolyze ATP, indicating that the enzyme clamp does not need to re-open to bind and hydrolyze ATP. When rapid-quench ATPase assays were initiated by the addition of ATP, the drug had no effect on the sequential hydrolysis of either the first or second ATP. By contrast, when the drug was prebound, the enzyme hydrolyzed one labeled ATP at the uninhibited rate but did not hydrolyze a second ATP. These results are interpreted in terms of the catalytic mechanism for topoisomerase II and suggest that ICRF-193 interacts with the enzyme bound to one ADP.

These enzymes are the targets of numerous antibiotic and anticancer drugs (1.Maxwell A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 2.Liu L.F.

The enzyme cleaves one segment of DNA, the gated or G segment,1 through the transient covalent attachment with a pair of active site tyrosines (12.Sander M. Hsieh T.S. J. Biol.

The enzyme traps a second segment of DNA, the transported or T segment, when ATP binding causes the NH2-terminal ATPase domains to dimerize (14.Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A.

Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The enzyme rapidly hydrolyzes one of its two bound ATP molecules (18.Harkins T.T. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7292-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and then transports the T segment through the cleaved G segment (19.Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Only after the first ADP has been released from the enzyme does the topoisomerase hydrolyze the second ATP (20.Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This unusual type of sequential ATP hydrolysis mechanism is presently only known to be shared with the DNA polymerase clamp-loading enzymes (21.Hingorani M.M. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5131-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). There are two very different types of drugs that inhibit topoisomerase II: the DNA-cleaved complex-stabilizing drugs exemplified by etoposide and the catalytic inhibitors including the bisdioxopiperazines (e.g. ICRF-193, -187, and -159) (22.Andoh T. Ishida R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 23.Ishida R. Miki T. Narita T. Yui R. Sato M. Utsumi K.R. Tanabe K. Andoh T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4909-4916PubMed Google Scholar). The in vivo target of ICRF-193 and related compounds was shown to be topoisomerase II using a yeast genetic system in which the levels of the enzyme could be modulated (24.Ishida R. Hamatake M. Wasserman R.A. Nitiss J.L. Wang J.C. Andoh T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2299-2303PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies of these drugs have shown that they function by trapping the enzyme as the closed-clamp intermediate in the presence of ATP, inhibiting the ATPase activity and catalytic turnover of the topoisomerase (25.Tanabe K. Ikegami Y. Ishida R. Andoh T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4903-4908PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Point mutations, causing resistance to these drugs, map to the ATPase domains of topoisomerase II (28.Sehested M. Wessel I. Jensen L.H. Holm B. Oliveri R.S. Kenwrick S. Creighton A.M. Nitiss J.L. Jensen P.B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1460-1468PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Wessel I. Jensen L.H. Jensen P.B. Falck J. Rose A. Roerth M. Nitiss J.L. Sehested M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3442-3450PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, ICRF-193 has been shown to directly bind to the dimerized ATPase domains of the yeast enzyme (17.Olland S. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21688-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies of the topoisomerase II-targeting drugs are useful both for probing the mechanism of the enzyme and for understanding the drug interactions. Recently we analyzed the effect of etoposide on the ATPase and DNA transport activities of yeast topoisomerase II using steady-state and rapid kinetic techniques (30.Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30690-30696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). By preventing G segment religation, etoposide inhibits topoisomerase II after the first ATP has been hydrolyzed and the T segment has been transported and before the second ADP is released. These results explain why this drug is a hyperbolic noncompetitive inhibitor of the ATPase activity. Although ICRF-193 is known to inhibit the ATPase and DNA transport activities of topoisomerase II by stabilizing the closed clamp (26.Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), its precise mechanism of inhibition remains obscure. In the present study, steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics were used to probe the effects of stabilizing the closed-clamp intermediate on the topoisomerase II reaction mechanism. Reagents used for ATPase and decatenation assays were previously described (30.Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30690-30696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). ICRF-193 was a kind gift of S. Olland and J. C. Wang (Harvard University). ICRF-193 stock solutions (40 mm) were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide; all reactions lacking the drug contained 1% dimethyl sulfoxide. Wild type Saccharomyces cerevisiae topoisomerase II was expressed and purified as before (31.Morris S.K. Harkins T.T. Tennyson R.B. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3446-3452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); the concentrations given are for the enzyme dimer. The reaction buffer used throughout contained 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm potassium acetate, and 10 mm magnesium acetate. The biotin-labeled circular DNA substrate was produced by a coupled nick translation/religation reaction. Purified plasmid DNA (10 kb) was nicked using DNase I in the presence of excess ethidium bromide as described previously (32.Hsieh T.-S. Wang J.C. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Biotinylated DNA was produced by reacting 15 μg of nicked plasmid DNA, 10 units of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, 0.3 mm dTTP, dGTP, and dATP, and 0.3 mm biotinylated-dCTP/dCTP in 100 μl using the BioProbe nick translation DNA-labeling kit (Sigma). After 20 s at 20 °C,E. coli DNA ligase (25 units, New England Biolabs) and 10 μl of 10× reaction buffer containing NAD+ were added, and incubation was continued for 30 min at 16 °C. The reaction was stopped with 50 mm EDTA, and the biotinylated DNA was purified using a TE-100 spin column (CLONTECH). Each decatenation reaction contained 50 nm topoisomerase II and 20 μg/ml kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) in reaction buffer plus 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and ICRF-193. ATP (1 mm) was added, and the reactions were held at 30 °C for 20 min before being quenched with 50 mm EDTA and 0.5% SDS. To determine the concentration required to reduce topoisomerase II decatenation activity by 50% (IC50), free DNA circles were quantified from reactions containing 8 different ICRF-193 concentrations (0.5 μm to 50 μm). Gels were quantified, and IC50 values were determined as described previously (30.Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30690-30696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Rates of multiple turnover and single turnover decatenation were analyzed as described previously (30.Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30690-30696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) in the presence and absence of 150 μm and 500 μmICRF-193, respectively. Steady-state and pre-steady-state ATPase assays were done as described previously (18.Harkins T.T. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7292-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30.Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control reactions showed that neither ICRF-193 nor dimethyl sulfoxide inhibited the coupling system used for the steady-state assays. Reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP to mixtures of preincubated topoisomerase II, DNA, buffer, and ICRF-193 at the indicated concentrations. For the pulse-chase pre-steady-state ATPase assays, the delay time was increased to 2.0 s. Pre-steady-state experiments with pre-bound ICRF-193 were performed as follows. Topoisomerase II (30 μm) was mixed with 5 mm DNA base pairs and 300 μm ATP with and without 500 μm ICRF-193 in 150-μl final volume. The reactions were incubated for 30 min and then diluted 10-fold with reaction buffer plus 500 μmICRF-193 or dimethyl sulfoxide. These diluted solutions were then used for chemical quench and pulse-chase reactions as described above. Topoisomerase II (500 nm) was incubated with biotinylated circular DNA (50 nm plasmid) in reaction buffer for 30 min. Reactions contained either ATP (1 mm) or ICRF-193 (500 μm) and ATP (1 mm) or AMPPNP (1 mm) in a final volume of 100 μl; the same nucleotide and drug present in these initial incubations were continued in later washes and reaction buffer. Following this incubation, 10 μl of immobilized streptavidin beads (Pierce) were added, and each reaction was incubated for an additional 30 min at 4 °C with slow rotation. The beads were washed 15 times over several hours with 1 ml of 2m KCl plus either 1 mm ATP, 1 mmATP, and 150 μm ICRF-193 or 1 mm AMPPNP to isolate topologically trapped topoisomerase II-DNA complexes. Finally, the streptavidin beads from each reaction were resuspended in 50 μl of reaction buffer with or without 500 μm ICRF-193. One-half of each mixture was analyzed for the presence of topoisomerase II by Western blotting using polyclonal anti-topoisomerase II antibodies. The other half of each reaction was assayed for ATPase activity using a discontinuous TLC method (33.Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 1 mm[α-32P]ATP (0.05 μCi/μl). As a prelude to these studies, inhibition of topoisomerase II-catalyzed DNA transport by ICRF-193 was analyzed for the yeast enzyme under the present reaction conditions. kDNA, a network of approximately 5,000 multiply catenated 2.5-kilobase circles, was used for the multiple turnover decatenation assays. Fig.1 A shows a time course of kDNA decatenation in the absence and presence of the drug; the catenated substrate remains in the wells, whereas the unlinked products migrate with the expected mobility. In the absence of drug, topoisomerase II releases increasing concentrations of free DNA circles with time. In the presence of high concentrations of drug, the amount of free circle released remains constant from 15 s to 30 min. Additionally, the amount of free circle released in the presence of ICRF-193 and ATP is similar to the amount released when the reaction contained the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMPPNP (compare the first lanewith the last seven lanes). These results indicate that ICRF-193 potently inhibits DNA transport after at least one turnover has already occurred. To determine the IC50 for ICRF-193 and yeast topoisomerase II, the relative inhibition of kDNA decatenation after 20 min of incubation was determined for eight different drug concentrations (Fig. 1 B). The IC50 value was determined to be 6.5 ± 1 μm. Previously determined IC50 values for ICRF-193 have ranged from 0.9 to 12.6 μm for type II topoisomerases isolated from various eukaryotes (34.Sato M. Ishida R. Narita T. Kato J.-I. Ikeda H. Fukazawa H. Andoh T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), excludingS. cerevisiae. ICRF-193 has been shown to inhibit the ATPase activity of topoisomerase II (17.Olland S. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21688-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 26.Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), but this inhibition has never been characterized. The progress curves for the ATP hydrolysis reaction showed significant time-dependent nonlinearity in the presence of low drug (0.5–20 μm) and ATP (50–350 μm) concentrations (not shown). Nonlinearity in ATPase progress curves was previously seen in studies with NH2-terminal fragments of yeast topoisomerase II in the presence of the same drug (17.Olland S. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21688-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although this curvature indicates that ICRF-193 binds slowly to topoisomerase II, the drug is not a typical slow-binding inhibitor. Slow-binding inhibitors generally bind competitively with the substrate, and preincubation of the enzyme with the inhibitor abolishes the curvature of the progress curves (35.Morrison, J. F., and Walsh, C. T. (1988) Adv. Enzymol. 201–302Google Scholar). The inhibition of ATPase activity by ICRF-193 shows neither of these features. An explanation for this time-dependent inhibition will be presented under “Discussion.” To analyze the steady-state inhibition, the final inhibited rates of ATP hydrolysis by topoisomerase II bound to DNA at five ATP concentrations and nine ICRF-193 concentrations were determined by fitting the progress curves to [ADP] =v s t − (v s −v 0 )/k, where v s is the final inhibited rate, v 0 is the initial inhibited rate, t is the time, and k is the observed rate constant for conversion between the initial and final rates (36.Szedlacsek S.E. Duggleby R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 144-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Since a coupled ATPase assay was used in which ATP is constantly being regenerated, the ATP concentration did not change during the reactions. A double-reciprocal plot of these data is shown in Fig. 2. These data clearly indicate that ICRF-193 is not a competitive inhibitor of ATP, since the curves do not converge on the y axis (i.e. V max,app continues to decrease at increasing inhibitor concentrations at infinite [ATP]. Note that the borders of this graph do not correspond to the axes.) The data also show that the K m,app decreases at increasing drug concentrations (the x intercept is −1/K m,app), which suggests that ICRF-193 binds the enzyme-ATP or enzyme-ADP complex. These data are not well fit by standard uncompetitive or noncompetitive inhibition models but can be fit by a hyperbolic mixed-type model, as shown in Fig. 2. The mechanism for this type of model is shown in Scheme 1. The fit to this model gives values of 22 μm and 2 μm for K i and αK i, respectively, indicating that ICRF-193 binds poorly to the free enzyme. The determined values ofk cat and βk cat are 4.9 s−1 and 1.0 s−1, respectively, suggesting that the enzyme can continue to hydrolyze ATP even with the drug bound. However, since the ATPase mechanism for topoisomerase II is considerably more complex than that shown in Scheme 1, these values should be taken as a rough approximation of the true values. In the absence of DNA, the ATPase data show similar characteristics but with altered values for the kinetic parameters (not shown). Scheme I. The steady-state inhibition data shown in Fig. 2 suggest that topoisomerase II can continue to slowly hydrolyze ATP when ICRF-193 is bound. Previous studies showed that when this drug binds to the enzyme in the presence of ATP, the drug locks it into the “closed-clamp conformation,” in which the ATPase domains are dimerized and circular DNA can be topologically trapped within the enzyme dimer (26.Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that the enzyme may continue to hydrolyze ATP even when it is locked in the closed conformation. However, another possibility is that a separate population of the enzyme remains free of drug and contributes all of the measured ATPase activity. To distinguish between these possibilities, the topoisomerase II complexes that were bound to ICRF-193 in the closed-clamp conformation were specifically isolated as illustrated in Fig. 3 A and tested for ATPase activity. Circular DNA that was nick-translated to contain a small number of biotin adducts was incubated with topoisomerase II. The three sets of reactions contained either 1 mm ATP, 1 mm ATP and 500 μmICRF-193, or 1 mm AMPPNP. Streptavidin beads were added, allowed to bind the biotin-DNA, and washed extensively in 2m KCl with or without ICRF-193 to isolate only the topoisomerase II dimers that were topologically trapped around the DNA; topoisomerase II does not remain covalently attached to cleaved DNA under these conditions, and it has been well demonstrated that ICRF-193 traps the enzyme in a topological linkage with circular DNA (26.Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the beads were boiled and analyzed by Western blot analysis, probing with anti-topoisomerase II antibodies, as shown in Fig. 3 B. These results show that a significant portion of the topoisomerase II was stably trapped around the isolated DNA in the presence of AMPPNP or ATP plus ICRF-193 but not in the presence of ATP alone. Separate aliquots of the beads were analyzed for ATPase activity, as shown in Fig. 3 C. A significant level of ATPase activity was only seen for the beads from the reaction that contained ATP and ICRF-193. This level of drug-inhibited ATPase activity represents the amount expected for ∼60% of the input topoisomerase II. Together these results directly show that topoisomerase II trapped by ICRF-193 in the closed-clamp conformation continues to hydrolyze ATP. To further characterize how ICRF-193 inhibits the topoisomerase II reaction, saturating concentrations of the drug were included in pre-steady-state ATPase and decatenation experiments. Two types of pre-steady-state ATPase experiments, pulse-chase and chemical quench, have been used to determine the ATPase mechanism of topoisomerase II, as described previously (18.Harkins T.T. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7292-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20.Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 30.Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30690-30696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 31.Morris S.K. Harkins T.T. Tennyson R.B. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3446-3452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The pulse-chase burst amplitude and burst rate indicate the concentration of ATP that is bound and hydrolyzed within a single turnover of the enzyme and the rate at which that ATP is bound, respectively. The chemical quench burst amplitude and rate indicate the concentration and rate of the ATP hydrolyzed before the rate-determining step in the mechanism, respectively. The results of chemical quench and pulse-chase experiments performed with 7.3 μm topoisomerase II dimer with and without 500 μm ICRF-193 are shown in Fig.4. In the absence of drug, the results are the same as those previously seen; the pulse-chase burst amplitude equals the ATP active-site concentration present, and the chemical quench burst amplitude is approximately half that concentration. The results in the presence of the drug indicate that ICRF-193 has little effect on the first turnover of ATP hydrolysis by topoisomerase II. The burst rates are unaffected by the drug, whereas both burst amplitudes are reduced by 15%. These results are in agreement with the interpretation of the steady-state results, indicating that ICRF-193 may bind and inhibit a small fraction of the enzyme unbound to ATP; however, the majority of inhibition is detected after the first turnover. The results shown in Fig. 1 indicate that ICRF-193 inhibits multiple turnover decatenation. To determine if any inhibition is seen in the first turnover, rapid kinetic analysis of single turnover decatenation reactions was performed. The rates of single turnover decatenation by topoisomerase II in the presence of ATP have previously been measured using singly catenated DNA circles and a rapid quench apparatus (19.Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,30.Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30690-30696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The results of similar experiments performed in the presence and absence of ICRF-193 are shown in Fig. 5. The drug has no effect on the rate of single turnover decatenation, indicating that inhibition only occurs after the first turnover. The results from above pre-steady-state experiments indicate that ICRF-193 does not significantly inhibit topoisomerase II during the first turnover. However, it is also apparent that this drug inhibits soon after the first turnover. To further characterize how it inhibits the topoisomerase, a pre-steady-state experiment in which the drug was pre-bound to the enzyme was performed. Since the drug did not appreciably bind in the absence of ATP, high concentrations of enzyme, DNA, and ICRF-193 were preincubated with 300 μm unlabeled ATP for 30 min. This reaction mixture was then diluted 10-fold into buffer containing ICRF-193 before performing pre-steady-state analysis. An identical experiment was performed in the absence of drug to serve as a control. The results of these chemical quench and pulse-chase reactions, in which the final topoisomerase II concentration was 1.5 μm dimer, are shown in Fig.6. In the absence of drug the results are the same as seen previously where the pulse-chase burst amplitude is twice the chemical quench burst amplitude. However, in the presence of ICRF-193, the chemical quench and pulse-chase burst amplitudes are the same, indicating that when the drug is bound, topoisomerase II only hydrolyzes one ATP. These results are interpreted in terms of a model for the enzyme mechanism under “Discussion.” ICRF-193 inhibits topoisomerase II by an unusual mechanism. Although this drug had no effect on the rate of first turnover decatenation, it potently inhibited later turnovers. At low drug concentrations, steady-state ATPase progress curves were nonlinear; however, the drug was not a typical slow-binding inhibitor. This drug did not bind competitively with ATP, and the steady-state inhibition is best explained by a mixed-type inhibition model. As was previously seen, ICRF-193 locked topoisomerase II into the closed-clamp conformation that surprisingly continued to hydrolyze ATP with a rate approximately 4-fold lower than the uninhibited rate. Pre-steady-state ATPase assays performed on the millisecond time scale showed that this drug did not inhibit the rate of hydrolysis of either the first or second ATP. However, once the drug had been allowed to pre-bind in the presence of ATP, it again had no effect on hydrolysis of the first labeled ATP, but it prevented hydrolysis of a second labeled ATP. Together, all of these results suggest a consistent model for how ICRF-193 inhibits topoisomerase II. To understand how this drug inhibits the enzyme, these results must be analyzed in the context of the topoisomerase II reaction mechanism. Previous studies showed that this enzyme, bound to DNA, hydrolyzes two ATP molecules in a sequential fashion (20.Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Transport of the T DNA segment through the G segment occurs after hydrolysis of the first ATP and before hydrolysis of the second ATP (19.Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A new mechanism based on these results has been previously described in detail (19.Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A schematic representation of this mechanism as well as a proposed mechanism for ICRF-193 inhibition is shown in Fig. 7. Since reactions initiated by the addition of ATP showed no inhibition by ICRF-193 in the first turnover of either ATP hydrolysis or DNA transport, the drug did not significantly bind to the free enzyme or to one of the enzyme-ATP complexes (i.e. ICRF-193 did not bind to any of the complexes before complex E in Fig. 7). However, since both the ATPase and DNA transport reactions were inhibited immediately after the first turnover products were seen, we predict that this drug binds to the enzyme-ADP complex (complex E). When the topoisomerase II dimer is bound to only one ATP, the closed-clamp form of the enzyme is known to be stabilized (37.Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 749-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not unreasonable to predict that the enzyme bound to one ADP has a similar conformation, as shown for complex E. The drug etoposide was previously shown to inhibit the reaction at one of the steps converting complex D to complex E, either release of the first ADP or hydrolysis of the second ATP (30.Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30690-30696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Since etoposide is known to inhibit DNA religation (38.Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6157-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 39.Robinson M.J. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1807-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), it follows that G segment religation may occur at one of these two steps. ICRF-193 binding to complex E, converting it to complexF, would explain many of the results reported in this and previous studies. Only one labeled ATP can bind and be hydrolyzed by complex F, exactly what is seen in the pre-steady-state results shown in Fig. 6. Complex F is predicted to be locked in the closed clamp conformation and to hydrolyze ATP with a reduced rate, as is seen in the results shown in Fig. 3. Previously, ICRF-193 was shown to bind to the closed-clamp form of the enzyme and prevent its conversion to the open-clamp form (26.Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). This proposed mechanism also predicts the nonlinear progress curves seen at low drug concentrations in the present and previous studies (17.Olland S. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21688-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); partitioning of the reaction between release of ADP (complex E → complex A) and binding of ICRF-193 (complex E → complex F) was shown by computer modeling to result in slow inhibition (not shown). Studies on the antagonism of etoposide-stabilized DNA cleavage by ICRF-193-type inhibitors suggested that etoposide acts before ICRF-193 in the mechanism (22.Andoh T. Ishida R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 40.Sehested M. Jensen P.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), again in agreement with the model shown in Fig. 7. When the ICRF-193 inhibition was analyzed in terms of the sequential mechanism for ATP hydrolysis by topoisomerase II, it became clear why the closed-clamp form of the enzyme can continue to hydrolyze ATP. Topoisomerase II rapidly hydrolyzes only one of its two bound ATP and releases the Pi and ADP before the second ATP can be hydrolyzed (20.Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Since ICRF-193 apparently binds and locks the enzyme in the closed-clamp conformation after the first ADP has been released and the second ATP has been hydrolyzed, the resulting complex has one open ATP binding site. Our model predicts that ATP can bind to this site, as shown in complex G of Fig. 7 and be hydrolyzed by the enzyme. These results demonstrate the utility of incorporating pre-steady-state analysis in the study of enzyme-drug interactions. We thank S. Olland and J. C. Wang for the generous gift of ICRF-193 and for sharing results before publication and to A. Leyes for helpful discussions."

Kindling in the hippocampus is a typical model of temporal lobe epilepsy, which induces many immediate early genes including Arc (18.Link W. Konietzko U. Kauselmann G. Krug M. Schwanke B. Frey U. Kuhl D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5832-5836Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the case of ischemia (6.Akins P.T. Liu P.K. Hsu C, Y. Stroke. 1996; 27: 1682-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), the mRNAs of immediate early genes are increased in regions of the brain known to be most susceptible to ischemia. Recently, surprising advances have been achieved in the study of PCD or apoptosis (13.Hale A.J. Smith C.A. Sutherland L.C. Stoneman V.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, PCD has been shown to play an important role in the normal course of development and in pathologic states such as ischemia, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and epilepsy (14.Gould E. McEwen B.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 15.Coyle J.T. Puttfarcken P.

Neuronal plasticity, which can be thought of as a kind of differentiation, has been suggested to share a signal transduction pathway with PCD, but the details are yet to be determined (17.Faddis B.T. Hasbani M.J. GoldBerg M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 941-950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arc is thought to be an immediate early gene encoding an effector protein, which is proposed to mediate cytoskeletal changes underlying stimulus-induced neuronal plasticity (11.Lyford G.L. Yamagata K. Kaufmann W.E. Barnes C.A. Sanders L.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Lanathan A. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1995; 14: 433-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the function of Arc, we searched for proteins with which it interacts using the yeast two-hybrid system. Such interacting proteins may constitute a signal transduction pathway including Arc in neuronal plasticity or PCD. Here, we report the identification of a novel protein designated Amida (named after Amida, a Buddhist god who is believed to come over the dying and give them a comfortable death), which is associated with Arc, localized in the nucleus and induced apoptosis when overexpressed in cultured cells. Adult male rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley) were purchased from Nihon-Dohbutsu Co. (Japan) and cared for in accordance with the guideline of Experimental Animal Care issued from the Prime Minister's Office of Japan. Two-hybrid screening (19.Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The cDNA fragment was labeled by random priming (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using [α-32P]dCTP. Using the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega, Madison, WI), pBluescript-Amida was translated with [35S]methionine. PC12 cells grown on a 9-cm Petri dish were washed with PBS and lysed by sonication in IP buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 2 mm Na2VO4, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40). After centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 20 min, the supernatant was used as cell lysate. Thein vitro translation reaction mixture was incubated at 4 °C with continuous rotation for 16 h with the lysate of PC12 cells which express Arc protein abundantly. Then the mixture was incubated with 10 ml of protein A-agarose suspension (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) for another 1 h. After eight washes, immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. For the in vivointeraction assay, COS-7 cells were cultured on 9-cm Petri dishes and transiently transfected with 16 μg of pCS2+c-myc-tag-Amida and the same amount of pEGFP-C1-Arc (pEGFP-C1; CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48 h, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed by sonication in IP buffer. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was used as cell lysate. The cell lysate was incubated with 10 μg of anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Science, Cambridge, MA) at 4 °C with continuous rotation for 16 h. Then the mixture was incubated with 20 μl of protein A-agarose suspension for another 1 h. After eight washes, immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed using anti-Arc-specific antiserum (11.Lyford G.L. Yamagata K. Kaufmann W.E. Barnes C.A. Sanders L.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Lanathan A. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1995; 14: 433-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar) at 1000-fold dilution and detected by the ECL immunodetection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An identical procedure was performed for analysis of Amida deletion mutants except that the transfected plasmids were the pEGFP-C1 derived vectors which code EGFP-Amida (wild type), EGFP-D1, EGFP-D2, or EGFP-D3 with pCS2+c-myc-tag-Arc and that the antibody used for immunoblotting was a polyclonal antibody against GFP (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). COS-7 or NG108-15 cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated chamber slides and apoptosis was assessed by the use of the DNA-staining dye DAPI. TUNEL staining was also performed using the Apoptosis Detection System (Promega, Madison, WI) except that staining was carried out with propidium iodide. Then, anti-Myc monoclonal antibody was added in 2 mg/ml dilution with 10% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. After 16 h incubation at 4 °C, cells were washed in PBS 3 times and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat F(ab′)2 fragment to mouse IgG (Cappel, West Chester, PA) in 1:500 dilution with the same buffer at 4 °C for 16 h. Finally, cells were washed in PBS three times, mounted with Slow Fade Antifade (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) and observed by fluorescent microscopy. COS-7 cells cultured on poly-d-lysine-coated 2-well culture slides were transiently transfected with pSV40NLS-EGFP-EGFP-C1 (encoding tandem repeated EGFP fused with the nuclear localization signal of SV40 large T antigen), pCS2+c-myc-tag-Amida, pCS2+c-myc-tag-Arc, and pCS2+c-myc-tag in various combinations. The amount of pSV40NLS-EGFP-EGFP-C1 was always ¼ of total DNA transfected using Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Germany). After 72 h, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, washed three times with PBS for 5 min each, and stained with DAPI. After washing three times in PBS for 10 min, cells were mounted and observed by fluorescent microscopy. Pictures of cells were analyzed by the following methods. First, EGFP-positive cells were identified and then pyknotic nuclei observed by DAPI staining of those cells were counted. Each graph represents at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate in which about 150 cells were individually examined. The ratio of pyknotic to total cells was calculated and statistically analyzed using the t test. Yeast two-hybrid screening was employed to investigate the function of Arc. A complementary DNA encoding Ser67-Glu396 of Arc, which was used as bait, was ligated to the GAL 4-binding domain in plasmid vector pPC97 (20.Li X.J. Li S.H. Sharp A.H. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Schilling G. Lanathan A. Worley P.F. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) for screening of a rat hippocampus cDNA library. This region contains nearly the full-length amino acid sequence of Arc including the α-spectrin homologous domain. Screening of approximately 200,000 colonies resulted in 15 positive clones. One clone (Amida) had an insert of 700 base pairs with no homology to known genes. The cDNA insert of the Amida clone was used to screen a rat hippocampus cDNA libraries to obtain a full-length cDNA sequence. Screening over 300,000 clones resulted in three independent positive clones. One of them contained the start consensus sequence (22.Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 12: 3919-3929Google Scholar) with an upstream stop codon in an identical frame with the Amida-Gal4 activation domain fusion protein. This 900-base pair cDNA contains the full-length coding region of Amida as shown in Fig. 1. Amida has no homology with known proteins, but showed significant homology to a clone (AA895828) from mouse expressed sequence tag (EST) library. The protein of highest amino acid homology found in a FASTA data base search was Homo sapiens hepatitis δ antigen interacting protein A, which has 28.8% identity in a 177-amino acid overlap. The expression of Amida mRNA was investigated by Northern blot. Analysis with 2 mg of poly(A) RNA revealed that expression of Amida is ubiquitous, but abundant in the brain (Fig. 2 A). Transcripts of approximately 1.2 and 1.0 kilobases were found in Northern blot. Maximal electroconvulsive seizure with pretreatment with cycloheximide, which superinduce immediate early genes in the hippocampus, did not increase the mRNA (Fig. 2 B). Amida mRNA was mainly detected in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus by in situhybridization (data not shown). To confirm that Amida is associated to Arc, a reconstruction experiment in vitro was performed. Amida protein was translated in vitro and [35S]methionine-labeled using the reticulocyte lysate system. The predicted molecular mass of Amida protein is about 30 kDa, but the in vitro translated product migrated as 46 kDa in SDS-PAGE. This discrepancy may be due to the acidity. The mixture was incubated with the lysate of PC12 cells which abundantly express Arc protein. Then, immunoprecipitation with anti-Arc-specific antiserum was performed. Labeled Amida protein was specifically co-precipitated, while the in vitro translated products of other clones were not (Fig.3 A). For the in vivo interaction assay, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with both Myc-tagged Amida and EGFP-Arc fusion proteins. After 48 h, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed using anti-EGFP-specific antiserum (Fig.3 B). EGFP-Arc fusion protein of 80 kDa was specifically precipitated with Myc-tagged Amida protein, while no signal was seen when control Myc-tag peptide was co-expressed. Furthermore, we tried to examine whether Amida interacts with the other proteins nonspecifically or not. When Myc-tagged (MT) Amida and EGFP were co-transfected in COS-7 cells and then the cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, Amida did not associate with EGFP (Fig. 3 C). To investigate the function of Amida in cells, a mammalian expression vector pEGFP-C1-Amida which encodes an EGFP-Amida fusion protein was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. An intense fluorescent signal was exclusively detected inside the nucleus (Fig.4, B and C), while the signal was seen diffusely throughout the cell which expresses only EGFP (Fig. 4 A). Three days after transfection, most of the COS-7 cells expressing the EGFP-Amida fusion protein showed a small and round morphology which is characteristic of cells undergoing apoptosis. Fluorescent microscopic observation by DAPI staining revealed that only EGFP-Amida positive cells exhibited nuclear condensation and fragmentation (Fig. 4, D and E). Similar changes were seen in other cell lines such as NG108-15 (data not shown). To confirm that the Amida expressing cells were dying by apoptosis, a double staining study using the TUNEL reaction and immunocytochemistry against Myc-tag was performed. Most of the NG108-15 cells expressing Myc-tagged Amida were TUNEL positive (Fig. 4, F,G, and H), while few cells transfected with vector alone showed a positive TUNEL response. It was thought that Amida has two putative nuclear localization signals which abundantly contain positively charged residues such as lysine or arginine. Deletion mutants D1, D2, and D3 as shown in Fig.5 were designed to evaluate these putative nuclear localization signals (NLS1 and NLS2) and transfected into COS-7 cells. EGFP-D1 and EGFP-D2 showed nuclear localization (Fig.6, B and C) as was the case of EGFP-Amida (wild type, Fig. 6 A). But EGFP-D3, which has neither of the putative NLSs, was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and a showed similar pattern to EGFP alone (Fig.6 D). As EGFP and EGFP-D3 proteins are both small (26 and 37 kDa, respectively), these proteins could be transported diffusely into the nucleus. To confirm that D3 does not localize in nucleus, an expression vector which encodes a large double-EGFP (tandem fused two EGFPs)-D3 fusion protein of 60 kDa was constructed. Double-EGFP-D3 was exclusively distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig.7 E) as was double-EGFP alone (Fig. 7 A).Figure 7Analysis of nuclear localization and cell death induction by D3. Double-EGFP (two tandemly fused EGFPs) (A) and NLS of SV40 large-T antigen tagged with double-EGFP (C) were transfected into COS-7 cells.

Arrows in D show healthy morphology of the nuclei and in H induced cell death. Scale bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Furthermore, we investigated whether NLS1 and NLS2 are really novel nuclear localization signals. cDNA sequences which encode NLS1 or NLS2 were ligated to double-EGFP and transfected into COS-7 cells. Double-EGFP-NLS1 (Fig. 6, E and F) and double-EGFP-NLS2 (Fig. 6, G and H) localized in the nucleus as did a fusion protein which consists of a NLS from SV40 large T antigen and double-EGFP (Fig. 7, C andD). We investigated the ability of each deletion mutant to promote cell death. COS-7 cells expressing EGFP-D1 or EGFP-D2 fusion proteins showed apoptotic morphology as assessed by DAPI staining 72 h after transfection (data not shown). But, cell death was not observed, when double-EGFP-D3 was overexpressed (Fig. 7, Eand F). A fusion protein consisting of the NLS from SV40 large T antigen and double-EGFP-D3 restored nuclear localization, and exhibited death-promoting ability (Fig. 7, G andH). These results indicate that the D3 region is sufficient but nuclear localization of this region is necessary for promotion of cell death as summarized in Fig. 5. To investigate the domain of Amida which interacts with Arc, each deletion mutant was co-transfected with Arc and co-precipitated depicted in Fig. 8. EGFP-Amida (wild type), EGFP-D1, EGFP-D2, and EGFP-D3 were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells with Myc-tagged Arc. 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitation using anti-Myc monoclonal antibody was performed. The immunoprecipitate was immunoblotted with anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 8, IP: D1, D2, D3). EGFP-Amida (wild type), EGFP-D1, and EGFP-D2 fusion proteins could interact with Myc peptide-tagged Arc protein strongly, while EGFP-D3 interacted with Arc only weakly. A control experiment was carried out using a vector which encodes only EGFP peptide, which had no ability to interact with Myc-tagged Arc (Data not shown). We investigated the co-operative function of Arc and Amida. When EGFP-Arc was expressed alone in COS-7 cells, it showed a punctate and perinuclear distribution in the cytoplasm (Fig.9 A). In contrast, EGFP-Arc was distributed in the nucleus when it was co-expressed with Myc-tagged Amida (Fig. 9 C). To investigate the function of Arc on Amida-induced cell death, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with pSV40NLS-EGFP-EGFP-C1 (encoding tandem repeated EGFP fused with the nuclear localization signal of SV40 large T antigen) in various combinations with pCS2+c-myc-tag(MT)-Amida, pCS2 + c-myc-tag-Arc, pCS2+c-myc-tag. A constant amount of pSV40NLS-EGFP-EGFP-C1 was used to be always ¼ of the total DNA transfected. After 72 h, cells were fixed and stained with DAPI. At first, EGFP positive cells were checked and then the number of those cells that had pyknotic nuclei after staining with DAPI were counted. The proportion of cells with pyknotic nuclei from the EGFP-positive cells were calculated and analyzed with the statistical t test (Fig.10). Overexpression of Amida significantly increased the proportion of pyknotic nuclei, while Arc had no influence on cell death compared with vector alone (Fig. 9,A and B). Co-transfection of Arc and Amida (99:1, w/w of transfected plasmids), which represents close to physiological proportions of Arc and Amida in the dentate gyrus, revealed that Arc inhibited cell death induced by Amida when compared with the result of co-transfection of vector and Amida (99:1, w/w) (Fig. 9). These results indicate that Arc has no influence on cell death alone, but inhibits cell death induced by overexpression of Amida. We have isolated a novel protein designated Amida which interacts with Arc by yeast two-hybrid system, and confirmed that Amida has the ability to associate with Arc in an in vitro reconstruction assay and in transfected cells. Northern blot analysis revealed thatAmida has two major transcripts of 1.0 and 1.2 kilobases. As reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using primers from the 5′- and 3′-regions of the coding region produced a single band, the two transcripts may differ in the non-coding regions. Many peripheral tissues also contain Amida mRNA less than 13 level of that in the brain, although Arc is expressed at low level. In the thymus a band of 4 kilobases was also detected in Northern blot analysis, but we have not analyzed it yet.Amida expression was also detected in PC12, C6 glioma, and NG108-15 cell lines. Compared with the dramatic induction ofArc after maximal electroconvulsive seizure (11.Lyford G.L. Yamagata K. Kaufmann W.E. Barnes C.A. Sanders L.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Lanathan A. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1995; 14: 433-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar), the increase of Amida expression in the dentate gyrus induced by maximal electroconvulsive seizure was not observed even after cycloheximide administration. These data indicate that Amida is expressed constitutively in the brain. To assess the function of Amida, EGFP-Amida fusion protein was expressed in COS-7 cells and NG108-15 cells. We found that Amida protein is transported into the nucleus. Three days after transfection, most of COS-7 cells expressing EGFP-Amida fusion protein began to show a small and round morphology which is characteristic of apoptosis. We confirmed that this phenomenon is apoptosis by staining the cells with DAPI, nucleic acid fluorescent dye. A double staining study with the TUNEL reaction and immunocytochemistry against Myc-tag also confirmed that the mode of cell death in Amida expressing cells appears apoptosis. In a preliminary data, inhibition of caspase 1 did not attenuate cell death induced by overexpression of Amida. We demonstrated that both NLS1 and NLS2 are novel NLSs (Fig. 6). These NLSs are characteristic in that they are rich in arginine residues instead of lysine residues. Since double EGFP-D3 fusion protein did not enter the nucleus, it did not cause apoptosis. However, double EGFP-D3 fusion protein conjugated with a foreign NLS (SV40 large T antigen-derived NLS) induced apoptosis. This phenomenon indicates that the location of D3 in nucleus is responsible for apoptosis. The similar finding has been reported that nuclear localization of overexpressed huntingtin mutant is necessary for apoptosis in primary cultured striatal neurons (23.Saudou F. Finkbeiner S. Devys D. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). Further experiments are necessary to determine the precise region of Amida responsible for the mechanisms of apoptosis. Arc-EGFP expressed alone in COS-7 cells showed punctate and perinuclear distribution (Fig. 9). This pattern of distribution has been reported for the proteins which associate with cytoplasmic vesicles such as endocytotic compartments, exocytotic compartments (24.Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. Dahan S. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 779-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 25.Pouli A.E. Kennedy H.J. Schofield J.G. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), or mitochondria (26.Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). The cytosolic punctate pattern of Arc-EGFP distribution was, however, changed to a homogeneous nuclear one when it was co-expressed with Amida. These data indicate that Amida forms a complex with Arc and transports it into the nucleus. We also found that Arc suppressed the apoptosis triggered by overexpression of Amida, when they were co-transfected (Fig. 10). This result suggests a novel function of Arc in negatively modulating cell death, although further investigations using more physiological conditions are required. Taken together, our data suggest that Arc may interfere with programmed cell death by interacting with Amida and modulate the apoptotic function of Amida. We thank Dr. P. F.

https://openalex.org/W2110553704,"An imperfect estrogen receptor half-site response element direct-repeat, located within the TATA-less promoter of the human luteinizing hormone receptor (hLHR), was identified as an inhibitory site for Sp1/Sp3-driven basal transcription. Isolation of proteins recognizing this site by yeast one-hybrid screening of a human placenta cDNA library revealed three nuclear orphan receptors, EAR2, EAR3/COUP-TFI, and TR4. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays demonstrated that the in vitro translated nuclear orphan receptors specifically bound the direct-repeat motif of the hLHR promoter. Also, endogenous EAR2 and EAR3/COUP-TFI from JAR cell and human testis and TR4 from testes bound this motif in electrophoresis mobility shift assays. Functional analyses in CV-1 cells showed that EAR2 and EAR3/COUP-TFI repressed the hLHR promoter activity by up to 70% in a dose-dependent and sequence-specific manner. Conversely, TR4 activated the hLHR promoter activity up to 2.5-fold through binding to the same cis-element. The stimulation was reversed by coexpression of EAR2 or EAR3/COUP-TFI, indicating their competitive binding for this site. Such recognition of a common cognate site by the proteins with antagonistic functions implies that a net regulation of the hLHR gene may result from the relative availability of repressors and activator in a physiological state. This also may contribute to the differential expression of the hLHR gene in gonadal and non-gonadal tissues.

It mediates gonadotropin signals and triggers intracellular responses that participate in maturation and function of the gonads as well as the regulation of steroidogenesis and gametogenesis (1.Catt K.J. Dufau M.L. Yen S.S.C. Jaffe R.B. Reproductive Endocrinology. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1991: 105-155Google Scholar, 2.Dufau M.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 461-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The LHR has also been identified in several non-gonadal tissues, including human nonpregnant uterus, placenta, fallopian tubes, uterine vessels, umbilical cord, brain, and lymphocyte, and in rat prostate (for review, see Ref. 2.Dufau M.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 461-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Characterization of the human LHR gene has demonstrated genetic polymorphism with at least two forms of sequence heterogeneity by the presence or absence of a 6-bp insertion that encodes a leucine-glutamine dipeptide within the exon I coding region (3.Tsai-Morris C.H. Geng Y. Buczko E. Dehejia A. Dufau M.L. Hum. Hered. 1999; 49: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The minimal promoter has been identified within the 5′ 176-bp region (from ATG), which contains two Sp1 domains of central importance for the transcription of the TATA-less hLHR gene (4.Tsai-Morris C.H. Geng Y. Buczko E. Dufau M.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5.Geng Y. Tsai-Morris C.H. Zhang Y. Dufau M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an estrogen response element half-site located at the −171-bp position was indicated to be a repressive element on basal transcription (5.Geng Y. Tsai-Morris C.H. Zhang Y. Dufau M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mutation at the consensus AGGTCA sequence caused about 100% induction of the promoter activity in human placental choriocarcinoma JAR cells and SV40-transformed placental cells, suggesting release of a putative repressor(s) from this site (5.Geng Y. Tsai-Morris C.H. Zhang Y. Dufau M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and mutagenesis revealed that multiple specific DNA-protein complexes were formed between the hLHR EREhs and JAR cell nuclear extracts (5.Geng Y. Tsai-Morris C.H. Zhang Y. Dufau M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This indicated that more than one protein could converge upon this common cognate site, although it does not exclude the possibility that the bands represent several truncated forms of a single protein. The estrogen receptor was not considered as a candidate since the hLHR promoter lacks an intact ERE composed of an inverted half-site repeat with a 3-base pair spacer. This is consistent with the lack of supershift of the complexes by estrogen receptor antibodies and of an estrogen effect on the hLHR promoter activity. Also, the hLHR EREhs did not bind monomeric orphan receptors SF-1 and ERR-1 (5.Geng Y. Tsai-Morris C.H. Zhang Y. Dufau M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The hexa-nucleotide sequence has been reported to serve as a core motif for hormone response elements recognized by other members of the steroid/orphan nuclear receptor subfamily (for review, see Ref. 6.Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that one or more of these receptors may bind the EREhs domain and participate in the transcriptional regulation of the hLHR gene expression during differentiation and development cascades. In this report, we have employed a yeast one-hybrid system to isolate regulatory proteins through binding to a target sequence containing the EREhs domain. Three human nuclear orphan receptors, EAR2, EAR3/COUP-TFI, and TR4, were cloned and shown to specifically bind the EREhs region in which an imperfect direct-repeat motif was identified as a cognate binding site. Functional analysis showed that EAR2 and EAR3/COUP-TFI repressed the hLHR promoter activity, whereas TR4 activated hLHR gene transcription. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the inhibition of the hLHR gene in JAR cells was caused by endogenous EAR2 and EAR3/COUP-TFI proteins binding to the direct-repeat motif. The MATCHMAKER One-hybrid System (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used to isolate the cDNA encoding for the EREhs domain binding proteins. The preparation of the target reporter constructs, integration of these constructs into yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YM 4271, isolation of plasmid from each candidate clone, as well as the screening procedures were preformed following established protocols recommended by the manufacturer. Basically, 4 tandem copies of 31-bp wild-type DNA fragment from the hLHR promoter (−176 to −145, 5′GTCGCAAGGTCAAGGCAGAGCAGACTCAGCGG-3′) containing the EREhs were inserted into pHis, pHis-1, and pLacZ yeast reporter vectors. The pHis/pHis-1 plasmids were then linearized and integrated into YM4271 chromosome to obtain yeast reporter strains YM-wtERE/His and YM-wtERE/His-1, respectively. After assessment of leaky His+ expression on titrated 3-AT (aminotriazole) (Sigma) plates, the YM-wtERE/His-1 was selected as the candidate strain. Then the pLacZ construct was linearized and integrated into the YM-wtERE/His-1 strain to obtain YM-wtERE/His/LacZ dual reporter strain. Another yeast reporter strain, YM-mERE/His-1, was also created in which mutation at the ERE half-site (m1) was introduced into the target sequence (5′- GTCGCAATTTCAAGGCAGAGCAGACTCAGCGG-3′), and it was used in binding selectivity assay. The YM-wtERE/His/LacZ strain was then transformed with the GAL4 activation domain fused human placenta cDNA library (CLONTECH) and selected on histidine-deficient plates containing 30 mm 3-AT. Large colonies from the −His plates were transferred onto Hybond N filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and further screened for β-galactosidase activity. The plasmid DNA, recovered from His+/lacZ+ yeast colonies, was transformed into DH5α cells. Plasmid DNA extracted from bacteria was transformed back into both wild type and EREhs mutant yeast reporter cells to retest for His+ phenotype and the binding specificity. The cDNA from reproducible positive clones was partially sequenced. The nucleotide sequences were compared with sequences in the GenBank™/EMSL data bases using Fasta program. All plasmids were constructed by standard recombinant DNA techniques. ASacI/BglII fragment harboring the hLHR gene promoter region (−176 to +1) was cloned into pGL2 basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) just upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. Mutant constructs generated by polymerase chain reaction were designed to mutate the DNA sequence with putative protein binding activity. All mutants were verified by sequence analysis. For construction of expression plasmids, DNA fragments containing full-length cDNAs of EAR2 (1.21 kilobases), EAR3/COUP-TFI (1.27 kilobases), and TR4 (1.79 kilobases) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from yeast clones 9, 5, and 2, respectively. These three orphan receptors were cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Full-length RARα and RXRβ expression plasmids were obtained in two steps. A 660-bp EcoRI/SalI fragment corresponding to N-terminal 220 amino acids of RARα and a 420-bp EcoRI/NcoI fragment for the N-terminal 140 amino acids of RXRβ was first amplified by polymerase chain reaction from QUICK-Clone cDNA of human placenta (CLONTECH). The resultant fragment was ligated with the respective C-terminal part of the molecule into pcDNA 3.1 vector. The fidelity of the clones was verified by DNA sequencing. T7 promoter just upstream of the cloned genes in pcDNA 3.1 constructs was used to synthesize the three nuclear receptor proteins in an in vitro coupled transcription and translation system (TNT, Promega). The reaction was carried out in presence or absence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 1 μg of template DNA (linearized plasmid DNA). The molecular weights of the in vitro translated products were confirmed by electrophoresis/autoradiography before use in EMSA assays. Nuclear proteins from JAR cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and normal human testis tissues (Cooperative Human Network, Eastern Division, Philadelphia, PA) were prepared as described previously (7.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide probes for the EMSAs were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 or 6000 mCi/mmol, NEN life Science Products) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.). 5 μl of EAR2, EAR3/COUP-TFI, or TR4 cDNA-programmed rabbit reticulocyte lysate or 5 μg of nuclear protein was added to 20 μl of binding reaction containing 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 4 mm Tris-HCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ZnSO4, 1 μg of polydeoxyinosinic deoxycytidylic acid, 1 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA (only for TNT proteins), and a 5–10 × 104 cpm probe on ice for 15 min. As a control, the probe was also incubated with the same amount of unprogrammed TNT lysate. In competition assays, unlabeled DNA sequences were added to the reaction 15 min before the addition of the probe. In supershift assays, specific antibodies or 2 μl of normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were preincubated with proteins for 30–60 min at 4 °C before the probe was added. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 5% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis containing 0.5 × TBE (0.89 m Tris, 0.89 m boric acid, 0.02 m disodium EDTA for 10 × TBE). For generations of antibodies, three peptides of sequences ASDAEPGDEERPG (amino acids 39–51) for EAR2 (peptide 2), SWRDPQDDVAGGNP (amino acids 7–20) for EAR3/COUP-TFI (peptide 3), and SIQEDKLSGDRIK (amino acids 453–466) for TR4 (peptide T) were used to immunize rabbits. Antisera for both EAR3/COUP-TFI and TR4 were purified using a protein A affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to obtain total IgG fractions. Specific IgG for EAR2 was obtained by passing EAR2 antisera through the peptide 2-coupled cyanogen bromide (CNBr) affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 3 μg of IgG protein against EAR3/COUP-TFI or TR4 and 0.5 μg of IgG against EAR2 were used for antibody supershift assays in the EMSAs, respectively. Antibody against SF-1/Ad4BP (steroidogenic factor 1) was kindly provided by Dr. Morohashi, Kyushu University, Japan. Antibodies against RXRα and RXRβ were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. CV-1 cells (African green monkey kidney cells, American Type Culture Collection) were routinely maintained in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and l-glutamine. JAR cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum. JAR cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of different hLHR promoter/luciferase constructs and 0.3 μg of pRSV-βgal plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the protocols from the manufacturer. CV-1 cells (2 × 105) were seeded on 6-well culture plates 24 h before transfection. The medium was replaced before transfection with 1 ml of medium without serum and antibiotics. Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of promoter/luciferase construct and different doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 μg) of expression vectors harboring EAR2, EAR3/COUP-TFI, or TR4. 0.3 μg of pRSV-βgal plasmid DNA was also cotransfected as an internal control to normalize the transfection efficiency. The final DNA concentration was adjusted using empty vector DNA. Cells were replaced 3 h later with normal culture medium and collected 40 h after transfection. The cell lysates were extracted, and the luciferase activity was measured by luminometry (8.Alam J. Cook J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and normalized by β-galactosidase activity (9.Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at least three times in triplicate. The statistical significance was evaluated by analysis of variance test. Fig.1 illustrates the 176-bp promoter region of the human LHR gene in which the functional cis-elements regulating the promoter activity have been indicated. These include two Sp1-activating domains and a consensus ERE half-site (AGGTCA) located at the −171-bp position (from ATG) that displayed marked inhibition on the hLHR gene transcription in JAR- and SV40-transformed placental cells (5.Geng Y. Tsai-Morris C.H. Zhang Y. Dufau M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Since putative repressor proteins from the nuclear receptor family may bind to this site and binding selectivity could depend not only on the core EREhs sequence but also on the adjacent nucleotides, the sequences surrounding the EREhs were also considered. The lack of AT-rich nucleotides preceding the EREhs indicated that nuclear receptors that bind to the AGGTCA sequence as monomers were not likely candidate ligands. For these reasons, initial studies were centered on an imperfect direct-repeat motif that contains the consensus EREhs (termed as hs1) and a putative imperfect half-site (hs2) 3′ adjacent to the EREhs. Luciferase-reporter gene analyses were carried out to evaluate the function of these putative binding sites as well as to address their binding specificity. Wild type hLHR promoter (WT) and constructs with mutated hs1 (m1) and hs2 (m2) were transfected into JAR cells. The luciferase activity of the WT hLHR promoter is shown in Fig.2. Mutation at either the hs1 (m1) or the hs2 (m2) caused a marked increase of promoter activity by 100%, indicating that both hs1 and hs2 participated in the repression of the hLHR gene promoter. In contrast, mutation of the 3′ adjacent GREhs (see Fig. 1) had no effect. These results demonstrated that the inhibition of hLHR transcription was conferred by the imperfect direct-repeat motif. The required functionality of the two half-sites indicated that the repressor protein(s) likely binds to the cognate site as a dimer. Members of the RAR/thyroid receptor subfamily of the nuclear receptor superfamily including many orphan receptors can bind to a direct-repeat sequence as homodimers or heterodimers (for review, see Refs. 6.Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar and 10.Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). Thus, it was reasonable to assume that one or more of these may contribute to the observed inhibition of the hLHR promoter.Figure 2Identification of an imperfect direct-repeat element that mediates repression on the hLHR promoter activity.The wild-type 176-bp hLHR promoter/luciferase reporter gene (WT) and its mutant constructs with mutated hs1 (m1), hs2 (m2), or GREhs (m3) were transiently expressed in JAR cells. The promoter-less vector (Basic) was used as a negative control. Relative promoter activities are indicated as the percentage of the luciferase activity of the wild-type promoter (100%). The results were normalized with β-galactosidase activity and expressed as the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments of triplicate wells for each construct.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The yeast one-hybrid system was employed to identify regulatory proteins that specifically bind to the hLHR promoter via the direct-repeat motif. A target sequence containing tandem hs1, hs2, and adjacent sequences (designated as HS) was used to screen a human placenta cDNA library. Nine His+ and LacZ+dual positive clones were selected from 3.5 million yeast transformants and then verified by restored His+/LacZ+phenotypes in the subsequent several rounds of transformation into wild-type reporter strain (see “Materials and Methods”). Sequence analysis of the nine positive clones followed by a search in the GenBank™ identified three human nuclear orphan receptors and two human retinoid acid receptors. Two clones with different lengths of 5′- and 3′-flanking regions encoded the full-length EAR2 receptor. Three clones corresponded to the EAR3/COUP-TFI orphan receptor; one of these was full-length, and the others were identical clones lacking 11 amino acids at the N terminus. The third gene was identified as the full-length orphan receptor TR4 in two clones. The other two clones that corresponded to RARα and RXRβ receptors were N-terminus-truncated forms lacking 110 amino acids and 38 amino acids, respectively. These results suggested that multiple proteins recognized the same HS region, and this was confirmed in binding selectivity assays. A mutant yeast reporter strain in which the direct-repeat motif was disrupted through mutation of the hs1 site (m1) was established. The cDNAs corresponding to the five receptors were transformed into this mutant strain. The complete lack of growth (data not shown) of the transformants in histidine-deficient plates confirmed that we had cloned EAR2, EAR3/COUP-TFI, TR4, and RARα and RXRβ through their specific binding to the direct-repeat motif of the hLHR gene promoter. The nuclear orphan receptors EAR2, EAR3/COUP-TFI, and TR4 belong to the same RAR/TR/orphan receptor subfamily within the nuclear receptor superfamily. These three receptors have been reported to recognize a cis-element that is composed of a direct-repeat of the AGGTCA sequence, with elasticity regarding interspacing and nucleotide differences from the consensus core sequences (11.Enmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The initial identification of an imperfect direct-repeat motif as an inhibitory domain of hLHR gene promoter indicated that the hLHR could be transcriptionally regulated by these orphan receptors. EMSAs were therefore carried out to characterize their binding to the hLHR promoter. The receptors were first in vitro translated, and [35S]methionine was incorporated for detection of nascent protein synthesis. Expression of EAR2, EAR3/COUP-TFI, and TR4 cDNAs yielded proteins with the expected molecular mass of 42.9, 46.1, and 65 kDa, respectively, whereas no product was detected in mock translation control (not shown). EMSAs were performed using an oligonucleotide probe corresponding the HS region of the hLHR promoter (−176 to −145). Incubation of the probe with in vitro translated EAR3/COUP-TFI resulted in formation of a single DNA-protein complex, whereas no band was observed when unprogrammed lysate (NP) was used (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and 2). The complex was eliminated upon the addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled wild-type competitor (lane 3), demonstrating its specific binding to the HS region. The identity of the complex was verified by the evidence that it was completely supershifted by an EAR3/COUP-TFI antibody, but it was not affected by normal rabbit IgG (lanes 7 and 8). Furthermore, the EAR3/COUP-TFI complex was not competed by mutated oligomers m1 or m2 (lanes 4 and 5), indicating that both half-sites (hs1 and hs2) were required for the binding. The results were compatible with the notion that EAR3/COUP-TFI is able to recognize a broad range of direct-repeat motifs to which it binds as a stable homodimer (18.Ingraham H.A. Lala D.S. Ikeda Y. Luo X. Shen W.H. Nachtigal M.W. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2302-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). In addition, the GREhs, shown not to participate in the repression of hLHR gene (Fig. 2), when mutated, competed for the EAR3/COUP-TFI binding as the wild-type DNA (Fig. 3 A, lane 6). This further confirmed that EAR3/COUP-TFI specifically bound to the imperfect direct-repeat motif of the hLHR promoter. Similar results were obtained when in vitro translated EAR2 and TR4 were investigated in EMSAs (Fig.3, B and C). Both EAR2 and TR4 formed specific complexes with the HS probe (lanes 10 and 18), and these were absent in the controls lanes (lanes 9 and 17). The complexes were abolished by the wild-type competitor but not by oligomers with mutation at either hs1 or hs2 (lanes 11–13 and 19–21). The mutant GREhs inhibited the binding as the wild-type oligomer (lanes 14 and 22). The supershifted bands caused by an EAR2 antibody (lane 15) and a TR4 antibody (lane 23) verified the binding attributed to the expressed receptors. No supershift was observed with normal rabbit IgG (lanes 16 and24). Thus, the EMSAs illustrate that the nuclear orphan receptors EAR2, EAR3/COUP-TFI, and TR4 specifically bound the hLHR promoter region through the direct-repeat sequence. In contrast, EMSAs failed to detect RARα or RXRβ binding to the hLHR HS probe. Furthermore, functional analyses in CV-1 cells did not show retinoid acid or 9-cis-retinoid acid-mediated effect on hLHR transcription when the promoter was cotransfected with full-length RARα or RXRβ or both together (data not shown). These results are consistent with the notion that the RAR and RXR retinoid receptors, unlike EAR2, EAR3/COUP-TFI, and TR4, require a restricted spacer for high affinity binding (10.Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar, 12.Ben-Shushan E. Sharir H. Pikarsky E. Bergman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1034-1048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13437-13443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is therefore evident that RARα and RXRβ were detected in yeast by the highly sensitive system employed in this study through binding to tandem copies of the HS sequence containing the direct-repeat motif with zero spacing (DR0). However, such binding is not present or is too weak (not detected in the EMSA) to mediate a change in the hLHR promoter activity. The specific recognition of the hLHR promoter by the nuclear orphan receptors made it necessary to examine their potential functions in the regulation of the hLHR gene transcription. For these studies, cotransfection assays of the nuclear receptors with the hLHR promoter/luciferase reporter constructs (wild type or mutated hs1 or hs2) were carried out in CV-1 cells. In Fig. 4 A, it is shown that EAR2 repressed the hLHR wild-type promoter activity but had no effect on the basic promoter-less construct. Increasing the dose of EAR2 lowered the promoter activity by up to 70%. In contrast, the hs1 mutation (m1) abolished the inhibitory effect of EAR2, indicating that this site was essential for EAR2 to exert its action on the hLHR gene. Furthermore, coexpression of EAR2 did not repress the hs2-mutated construct (m2) but inhibited the activity of the GREhs mutant promoter (m3) to the same extent as the wild-type promoter (Fig.4 B). The results demonstrated that the negative regulation of the hLHR gene by EAR2 depended on the presence of an intact direct-repeat motif but not on the adjacent GREhs. These findings were consistent with those derived from the EMSA binding analysis (Fig. 3). Taken together, it was shown that EAR2 was able to repress the hLHR promoter activity in a dose-dependent and sequence-specific manner. Similar results were obtained with EAR3/COUP-TFI, which repressed the hLHR promoter activity by up to 55% in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition was also sequence-specific since the repression was eliminated by mutation of either hs1 or hs2 site but was not affected by the GREhs mutation (Fig. 4, C and D). In the absence of EAR2 or EAR3/COUP-TFI in CV-1 cells, the wild-type hLHR promoter was released from the inhibition, and therefore, the luciferase activity of the hs1- or hs2-mutated construct was not different from the wild-type promoter. The effect of the orphan receptor TR4 on the hLHR promoter activity was next examined in the cotransfection experiments in CV-1 cells. Unexpectedly, cotransfection of TR4 with the wild-type hLHR 176-bp promoter/luciferase construct activated the transcriptional activity up to 2.5-fold in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 A). The activation was abolished by mutation of either half-site (hs1 or hs2), but it was present in cells transfected with the GREhs mutant construct (Fig.5, A and B). The results show that TR4 is a transcriptional activator of the hLHR gene, and it exerts its function through the imperfect direct-repeat element. Occupancy of the same cognate site by EAR2, EAR3/COUP-TFI, and TR4 with apparent opposite functions suggested that they may antagonize each other in the regulation of the hLHR gene. This possibility was tested by coexpression of TR4 with equal amounts of expression plasmid for EAR2 or EAR3/COUP-TFI in the presence of the wild-type hLHR promoter. Upon the addition of EAR2 or EAR3/COUP-TFI, the TR4-mediated induction was completely abolished, and it was replaced by a repression comparable with that exhibited by EAR2 or EAR3/COUP-TFI alone (Fig.5 C). This suggested that the three proteins competitively bound to the same site. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the hLHR gene was subject to transcriptional repression and activation by nuclear orphan receptors. The results obtained from cotransfection assays in CV-1 cells demonstrate that nuclear orphan receptors EAR2 and EAR3/COUP-TFI potently repressed hLHR gene promoter activity in a sequence-specific manner. The subsequent studies were directed to determine whether the inhibition of hLHR gene in JAR cells was caused by the corresponding endogenous nuclear orphan receptors. EMSAs performed (Fig.6 A) by incubation of JAR cell nuclear extracts with the HS probe revealed the formation of three major DNA-protein complexes (a, b, andc as indicated by arrows, lane 1). The complexesa and b were competed by the 100-fold unlabeled wild-type competitor (WT, lane 2) but remained unchanged in the presence hs1 (m1)- or hs2 (m2)-mutated oligonucleotides (lanes 3 and4). However, complex c was significantly but not completely abolished by the wild-type oligomer. It was also not fully retained upon the addition of mutated competitors when compared with the complexes a and b. This indicated that the complex c was composed of more than one protein, some of which bound the HS probe nonspecifically. In addition, the GREhs mutant oligomers competed binding of the complexes (lane 5) as the wild-type DNA. The results illustrated two major complexes (a andb), and part of the complex (c) bound strictly to the direct-repeat motif of the hLHR promoter. These findings were similar to the binding specificity results from the EMSAs usingin vitro translated orphan receptors. Supershift assays using antibodies directed to the three receptors were carried out to elucidate the identities of the proteins binding to this site. The complex b was supershifted by the EAR2 antibody, and the complex a was supershifted by the EAR3/COUP-TFI antibody. The TR4 antibody had no influence on the observed complexes as the normal rabbit IgG (lanes 8 and 10), indicating TR4, did not participate in the regulation of the hLHR gene in JAR cells. This is consistent with the observed marked repression of the hLHR gene through the direct-repeat motif in these cells. A human SF-1 (steroidogenic factor 1) antibody against its DNA binding domain was also included in the supershift assays as a negative control (lane 9). SF-1 recognizes the AGGTCA as its cognate site to which it binds as a monomer, and the binding also strictly depends on the presence of AT nucleotides just preceding the consensus half-site, which are not present in the hLHR sequences. Furthermore, RARα and RXRβ did not participate in the regulation of the hLHR promoter activity, since no supershift bands were formed upon the addition of the antibodies of these two receptors in the EMSAs. Also, retinoid acid hormone treatment of JAR cells in reporter gene analyses did not show any effect on the hLHR promoter activity (data not shown). In addition, the observation that complex c was not supershifted by the antibodies tested suggested that the specific component of this complex, yet to be determined, may also participate in hLHR gene regulation. Therefore, transcriptional repression of the hLHR gene in JAR cells resulted from endogenous EAR2 and EAR3/COUP-TFI proteins, if not exclusively. Furthermore, EMSAs using human testes nuclear extract were performed to examine the binding to the HS probe of the hLHR promoter by the nuclear proteins from normal gonadal tissues (Fig.6 B). Two major DNA-protein complexes (1 and2) were formed (indicated by arrows, lane 11). Upon the addition of wild-type competitor, complex2 was completely abolished, whereas complex 1 was significantly reduced (lane 12). Both complexes were retained in the presence of mutated hs1 (m1) and hs2 (m2) oligomers (lanes 13 and 14); however, complex 2 but not complex 1 was completely abolished by the mutated GREhs (lane 15,m3). The results indicated that complex 2 was a specific band whose formation was solely dependent on the direct-repeat motif. Antibody supershift assays demonstrated that this complex could be supershifted by the EAR2, EAR3/COUP-TFI, and TR4 antibodies (lanes 16–18) but not recognized by the SF-1 antibody or normal rabbit IgG (lanes 19 and 20). The results demonstrated that the direct-repeat motif of the hLHR promoter was specifically bound by the orphan receptors EAR2 and EAR3/COUP-TFI in nuclear extracts from both JAR cells and gonadal tissues. In addition, TR4 present in the testes nuclear extracts also bound specifically to the same motif. Taken together, this is the first line of evidence showing that the hLHR gene is transcriptionally regulated by nuclear orphan receptors. An imperfect EREhs direct-repeat motif, compatible with the recognition site bound by members of RAR/TR/orphan nuclear receptor subfamily, was identified in this study as an inhibitory element for hLHR gene transcription in JAR cells. This domain specifically bound the nuclear proteins in JAR cells and human gonadal tissues in the EMSA analyses. The isolation of three nuclear orphan receptors, EAR2, EAR3/COUP-TFI, and TR4, from a one-hybrid screening of a human placenta library in yeast indicated that multiple proteins could be involved in the hLHR promoter regulation through this element. EAR2 is a subtype of EAR3/COUP-TFI, and TR4 shares 70% and 50% sequence identity with EAR3/COUP-TFI at DNA binding domain and putative ligand binding domain, respectively (15.Hirose T. Fujimoto W. Tamaai T. Kim K.H. Matsuura H. Jetten A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1667-1680PubMed Google Scholar). The conserved DNA binding domain of these orphan receptors confers their ability to recognize an identical/similar cognate element that is composed of a direct-repeat (DR) of AGGTCA core sequence with a spacer of variable length. The binding of these orphan receptors to the imperfect DR0 motif of the hLHR promoter was shown to be strictly mediated through the two half-sites (hs1 and hs2). Members of the orphan receptor subfamily have been found to play an important role in gonad and brain development (16.Chen F. Cooney A.J. Wang Y. Law S.W. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1434-1444PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Dajee M. Fey G.H. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1393-1409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Ingraham H.A. Lala D.S. Ikeda Y. Luo X. Shen W.H. Nachtigal M.W. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2302-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of major significance that they are recognized as participants in the transcriptional regulation of the hLHR gene. Functional analysis demonstrated that EAR2 and EAR3/COUP-TFI repressed the hLHR promoter activity in a dose-dependent and sequence-specific manner. EAR2 and, particularly, EAR3/COUP-TFI are generally recognized as repressor proteins regulating an array of different target genes (for review, see Ref. 19.Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The mechanism of their repression includes active inhibition of basal or activated transcription, quenching a transactivator-regulated transcription, and transrepression (20.Leng X. Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2332-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The inhibition of the hLHR gene appears to result from the active silencing function of EAR2 and EAR3/COUP-TFI rather than competition with, quenching, or titrating out a hormonal partner (14.Lee Y.F.

Biol. 1992; 12: 4666-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). EMSAs with JAR cell nuclear extracts revealed that EAR2 and EAR3/COUP-TFI antibodies caused supershift of two DNA-protein complexes of distinct migrating properties, indicating that recruitment of other cofactors via protein-protein interactions may participate in the regulation of hLHR gene transcription. EAR2 and EAR3/COUP-TFI were reported to interact directly with TFIIB, a component of basal transcriptional machinery (23.Ing N.H. Beekman J.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17617-17623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their repressive functions were found enhanced by interaction with two common nuclear receptor corepressors, NcoR (nuclear receptor corepressor) and SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (24.Shibata H. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 714-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, EAR3/COUP-TFI has been shown to interact directly with Sp1 protein, independent of the EAR3/COUP-TFI binding site, to enhance the activation of target gene transcription (25.Pipaon C. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2734-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 26.Rohr O. Aunis D. Schaeffer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31149-31155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It still remains to be determined whether EAR3/COUP-TFI-mediated repression of the hLHR promoter activity requires a direct interaction between EAR3/COUP-TFI and Sp1 protein. However, if such interaction occurs, it would involve EAR3/COUP-TFI bound to its cognate site, since our cotransfection studies with the hs1- or hs2-mutated constructs did not reveal the additional increase on the promoter activity over what was observed by exclusion of the inhibitory effect of the EAR3/COUP-TFI (Fig.4 B). The repression of the TATA-less hLHR gene by EAR2 and EAR3/COUP-TFI is probably achieved by direct or corepressor-bridged interaction with one or more components of the basal transcriptional machinery or, alternatively, by direct interaction with Sp1 to perturb the Sp1 driven hLHR gene transcription. In contrast to the actions of EAR2 and EAR3/COUP-TFI, the nuclear orphan receptor TR4 was demonstrated to be a transcriptional activator of the hLHR promoter through the same direct-repeat motif (DR0). To our knowledge, this is first demonstration that TR4 regulates target gene transcription through a DR0 direct-repeat cis-element. It has been reported that TR4 up-regulated the rat α-myosin heavy chain and S14 genes through a DR4 motif, whereas it inhibited the SV40 gene through a DR2 and squelched RAR/RXR-mediated stimulation of several genes through the DR1/DR5 element (14.Lee Y.F. Young W.J. Burbach J.P.H. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13437-13443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27.Lee H.J. Lee Y. Burbach J.P.H. Chang C. J. Biol.

In addition, it has been recently proposed that TR4 may adopt different conformations once bound to a DR3 vitamin D response element (DR3VDRE) or a DR4 thyroid hormone response element (DR4T3RE). Such change would allow TR4 to recruit different coregulators and, hence, to function as a repressor through DR3VDRE or as an activator through DR4T3RE (21.Lee Y.F. Young W.J. Lin W.J. Shyr C.R.

It is proposed that the induction of the hLHR gene by TR4 through the DR0 element will be dependent on the context of its full promoter region, taking into account the possible participation of coactivators. Coactivator proteins as transcriptional mediator/intermediary factor 2, steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1), and human receptor-interacting protein 140 (RIP140) have been found to interact with several nuclear receptors (for review, see Ref. 29.McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined whether such interaction is present in TATA-less genes and involved in the TR4-mediated induction of the hLHR gene. In JAR cells, the hLHR promoter appeared to be regulated solely by EAR2 and EAR3/COUP-TFI, since no DNA-TR4 complexes were observed in the EMSA. However, such complexes, including TR4, are readily observed in gonadal nuclear proteins, indicating that dual regulation of the hLHR gene by orphan receptors with opposite functions could occur in these tissues. Cotransfection of TR4 with EAR2 or EAR3/COUP-TFI converted the marked activation of the hLHR promoter induced by TR4 into an inhibitory effect conferred by EAR2 or EAR3/COUP-TFI through their competitive occupancy of the same binding site. Therefore, binding of the hLHR promoter by these nuclear orphan receptors with apparent opposite functions implies that the net outcome of the hLHR gene transcription could be determined by the relative availability of the repressors (EAR2, EAR3/COUP-TFI) and the activator (TR4) at a physiological or pathological stage. Such a mechanism provides a mode for regulation of the Sp1-driven hLHR gene expression in various states of differentiation and development."
https://openalex.org/W2042011713,"Abstract Myosin II and V are important for the generation and segregation of subcellular compartments. We observed that vesicular myosin II and V were associated with the protein scaffolding of a common subset of vesicles by density sedimentation, electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence. Solubilization of either myosin II or V was caused by polyphosphates with the following efficacy at 10 mm: for myosin II ATP-Mg2+ = ATP = AMP-PNP (5′-adenylyl imidodiphosphate) > pyrophosphate = tripolyphosphate ≫ tetrapolyphosphate = ADP > cAMP = Mg2+; and for myosin V pyrophosphate = tripolyphosphate > ATP-Mg2+ = ATP = AMP-PNP ≫ ADP = tetrapolyphosphate > cAMP = Mg2+. Consequently, we suggest solubilization was not an effect of phosphorylation, hydrolysis, or disassociation of myosin from actin filaments. Scatchard analysis of myosin V binding to stripped dense vesicles showed saturable binding with a K mof 10 nm. Analysis of native vesicles indicates that these sites are fully occupied. Together, these data show there are over 100 myosin Vs/vesicle (100-nm radius). We propose that polyphosphate anions bind to myosin II and V and induce a conformational change that disrupts binding to a receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1966945429,"The region of apolipoprotein E (apoE) that interacts directly with the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor lies in the vicinity of residues 136–150, where lysine and arginine residues are crucial for full binding activity. However, defective binding of carboxyl-terminal truncations of apoE3 has suggested that residues in the vicinity of 170–183 are also important. To characterize and define the role of this region in LDL receptor binding, we created either mutants of apoE in which this region was deleted or in which arginine residues within this region were sequentially changed to alanine. Deletion of residues 167–185 reduced binding activity (15% of apoE3), and elimination of arginines at positions 167, 172, 178, and 180 revealed that only position 172 affected binding activity (2% of apoE3). Substitution of lysine for Arg172 reduced binding activity to 6%, indicating a specific requirement for arginine at this position. The higher binding activity of the Δ167–185 mutant relative to the Arg172mutant (15% versus 2%) is explained by the fact that arginine residues at positions 189 and 191 are shifted in the deletion mutant into positions equivalent to 170 and 172 in the intact protein. Mutation of these residues and modeling the region around these residues suggested that the influence of Arg172 on receptor binding activity may be determined by its orientation at a lipid surface. Thus, the association of apoE with phospholipids allows Arg172 to interact directly with the LDL receptor or with other residues in apoE to promote its receptor-active conformation.

However, residues outside the receptor-binding region can also affect receptor binding activity. ApoE2 (Cys158) has only 1% of the LDL receptor binding activity of apoE3 (Arg158) and apoE4 (Arg158) (28.Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol.

Studies of carboxyl-terminal truncations of the 22-kDa fragment of apoE3 showed that residues 171–183 are also important for receptor binding activity (32.Lalazar A. Ou S.-H.I. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8447-8450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that arginines in this region may interact directly with the LDL receptor or, like Arg158, indirectly affect the receptor-binding region of apoE. Since the electron density of residues 163–191 is uninterpretable in the x-ray structure of the 22-kDa fragment of apoE (17.Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A.

Structure. 1994; 2: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we have taken a mutagenesis approach to determine which residues in this region are important in receptor binding activity. An internal deletion in apoE3 of residues 167–185 (apoE3Δ167–185) confirmed that this region had an effect on receptor binding activity. From the examination of point mutations in apoE3, we found that a single amino acid, Arg172, was responsible for this effect. Finally, sequence comparison of apoE3Δ167–185 with intact apoE3 implicated the importance of the presence of Arg172 and its possible positioning on a lipid surface for LDL receptor binding activity. The cDNAs of human apoE3 and apoE4 were inserted into a modified thioredoxin (Trx) fusion expression vector (pET32a; Novagen) as described previously (33.Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Weisgraber K.H.

Plasmids containing cDNA of human apoE or variants were transformed intoEscherichia coli (strain BL21 (DE3); Novagen). Several transformants were grown in LB medium at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.5–0.6 (550 nm). Trx-apoE expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 100 μg/ml) to the culture medium, after which the culture was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The transformants were screened for high expression of the Trx-apoE fusion protein by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. ApoE and variants were purified as described previously (33.Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Weisgraber K.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, the transformed E. coli were cultured in LB medium at 37 °C, and Trx-apoE expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 100 μg/ml) for 2 h. After the bacterial pellet was sonicated and the lysate was centrifuged to remove debris, the Trx fusion protein, which contains a His tag, was purified on a nickel affinity column. The fusion protein was then cleaved with thrombin to remove Trx from apoE. Before cleavage, the fusion protein was complexed with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) to protect the protease-susceptible region of apoE. The thrombin was inactivated with β-mercaptoethanol, the mixture was lyophilized and delipidated, and the protein was solubilized in 6 m guanidine HCl (0.1m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.01% EDTA, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol). Protein was isolated by gel permeation chromatography on a Sephacryl S-300 column in 4 m guanidine HCl (0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.01% EDTA, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol). The fractions containing apoE or variants were pooled, dialyzed against 5 mm NH4HCO3, and lyophilized. The protein was solubilized in 100 mmNH4HCO3 and stored at −20 °C. All apoE variants were structurally similar to apoE3 as determined by circular dichroism measurements (data not shown). Purified recombinant human apoE and variants were complexed with DMPC and isolated by KBr gradient cetrifugation as described (34.Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 542-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The apoE·DMPC discs were negatively stained on the surface of carbon fluid grids. Electron micrographs were made at a magnification of × 200,000 and imported with a video camera into an Image 1/AT image-analysis system. Particle size was analyzed by automated sizing and counting programs available on system software (mL version 4.03a; Universal Imaging Corp.). Multiple areas on a single grid were sampled. The complexes formed by the apoE variants and DMPC were the same size as normal apoE3 (disc diameter ranged from 15 to 17 nm). The receptor binding activities of the apoE·DMPC complexes were determined in a competition assay with125I-labeled human LDL and human primary fibroblasts in culture (34.Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 542-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). When complexed with DMPC, the 22-kDa fragment of apoE3 binds to the LDL receptor with high affinity (19.Innerarity T.L. Friedlander E.J. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12341-12347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LDL receptor-binding studies of carboxyl-terminal truncations of the apoE3 22-kDa fragment showed that a mutant consisting of residues 1–183 of apoE3, apoE3-(1–183), had essentially normal binding activity, but further truncation to residue 170, apoE3-(1–170), reduced binding activity to less than 1% of that of full-length apoE3 (32.Lalazar A. Ou S.-H.I. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8447-8450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since arginine residues are important in binding activity (2.Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3376) Google Scholar, 26.Mahley R.W. Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Weisgraber K.H. Brown J.H. Gross E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7279-7287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that one or more arginines in this region interact directly with the receptor or act to stabilize the receptor-binding region (32.Lalazar A. Ou S.-H.I. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8447-8450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that the region within residues 171–183 was indeed significant for apoE receptor binding activity and that the previous findings were not influenced by the absence of the major lipid-binding region in apoE (the 10-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment), we constructed internal deletions of apoE, rather than truncations. The first internal deletion (apoE3Δ167–185) was designed to eliminate four arginine residues (167, 172, 178, and 180) in this region. There are no lysines in the deleted region. The second variant (apoE4Δ186–223), in which residues adjacent to 167–185 were deleted, was constructed previously for studies of lipoprotein binding (25.Dong L.-M. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol.

The binding of apoE4Δ186–223 to the LDL receptor was essentially identical to that of apoE3 and apoE4. (In this assay, apoE3 and apoE4 have identical binding to the LDL receptor (28.Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2518-2521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).) However, apoE3Δ167–185 bound to the LDL receptor with only 15% of the binding activity of apoE3 (Fig. 1, TableII). These results are consistent with the data from the carboxyl-terminal truncation experiments, which suggested that part of the hinge region affects receptor binding activity.Table IISummary of the ability of apoE and variants to compete with LDL for the LDL receptorApoEConcentration of apoprotein·DMPC complex that displaced 50% of the 125I-LDL from the LDL receptor on cultured human fibroblasts ± S.D.Relative competitive ability ± S.D.aDetermined within a single experiment and then averaged between experiments.nμg protein/ml% apoE3 activityApoE30.042 ± 0.01510011ApoE40.038 ± 0.013105 ± 73ApoE3Δ167–185bp < 0.05 versus apoE3.0.407 ± 0.23215 ± 96ApoE4Δ186–2230.020 ± 0.005194 ± 653ApoE3 R167A0.043 ± 0.02292 ± 114ApoE3 R172Abp < 0.05 versus apoE3.1.850 ± 0.5802 ± 14ApoE3 R178A0.062 ± 0.03869 ± 244ApoE3 R180A0.034 ± 0.012129 ± 405ApoE3 R172Kbp < 0.05 versus apoE3.0.967 ± 1.0646 ± 54ApoE3Δ167–185 R189Abp < 0.05 versus apoE3.

Open table in a new tab To determine if the arginines in this region are important for receptor binding activity, we created four mutants in which an arginine was replaced with an alanine (apoE3 R167A, apoE3 R172A, apoE3 R178A, and apoE3 R180A). Of these four mutants, only apoE3 R172A had defective receptor binding activity (2% of apoE3) (Fig.2, Table II). A mutant with an arginine to lysine change at position 172 (apoE3 R172K) had just 6% of the binding activity of apoE3, indicating the importance and specificity of an arginine at position 172 (Fig. 3, Table II). Thus, the effect of this region on receptor binding activity could be narrowed down to a single amino acid, Arg172.Figure 3Ability of apoE3· DMPC (●), apoE3 R172A· DMPC (▪), and apoE3 R172K· DMPC (♦) to compete with human125I-LDL for the LDL receptor on normal human fibroblasts.

Data presented are from one of at least four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) However, there were some paradoxes in the results. Specifically, apoE3Δ167–185 had consistently higher binding activity than apoE3 R172A (15 versus 2%, p = 0.018). As a result, we decided to compare this section of the hinge region, residues 167–185, in apoE3 and apoE3Δ167–185. In apoE3Δ167–185, residues 186–204 are essentially shifted down to replace the deleted residues 167–185; therefore, residue 186 can be referred to as 167′ in the apoE3Δ167–185 variant and residue 204 as 186′. The other residues between 186 and 204 may be similarly renamed. When residues 186–204 (167′–185′) were aligned with 167–185 (Fig.4), it was revealed that an arginine at position 172 in apoE3 was replaced with an arginine in apoE3Δ167–185. (There are two arginines within the sequence from 186–204, at positions 189 (170′) and 191 (172′).) Furthermore, at position 183, a proline, which disrupts α-helical structure, was replaced with another proline, residue 202 (183′). Instead of clarifying the difference in receptor binding activity between the two mutants, this analysis produced more questions. If Arg172is important, why was the receptor binding activity of apoE3Δ167–185 defective? To explain this contradiction, we examined the predicted secondary structure of residues 167–204. Segrest et al. (35.Segrest J.P. Garber D.W. Brouillette C.G. Harvey S.C. Anantharamaiah G.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 303-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) predicted that residues 167–182 would form a class A amphipathic α-helix, and algorithms by Garnier et al. (36.Garnier J. Gibrat J.-F. Robson B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 540-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Gibratet al. (37.Gibrat J.-F. Garnier J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 425-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) also predict that these residues are helical. However, Rall et al. suggested that residues 165–200 contain mostly random structure and β turns (1.Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4171-4178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Nolte and Atkinson predicted only a short helical segment from residues 178–183 (38.Nolte R.T. Atkinson D. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1221-1239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Only the algorithm by Garnier et al. (36.Garnier J. Gibrat J.-F. Robson B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 540-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that residues 186–195 form a helical structure. With the possibility that segments within residues 167–204 form α-helices, we modeled residues 167–182 and 186–201 (167′–182′) as α-helices using the computer program Insight II (Fig.5). Comparison of the helices suggested an explanation for the paradoxical receptor binding of apoE3Δ167–185, specifically that positioning of Arg172on a lipid surface, with respect to the LDL receptor, could be critical. The α-helix modeled from residues 167–182 is amphipathic, with its opposing polar and nonpolar faces oriented along the long axis of the helix (35.Segrest J.P. Garber D.W. Brouillette C.G. Harvey S.C. Anantharamaiah G.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 303-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arginines 167, 178, and 180 are clustered at the polar-nonpolar interface, typical of a class A amphipathic α-helix (35.Segrest J.P. Garber D.W. Brouillette C.G. Harvey S.C. Anantharamaiah G.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 303-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that the arginine residues at the polar-nonpolar interface interact with the phospholipid head groups at the lipoprotein surface, while the hydrophobic face inserts into the phospholipid layer (35.Segrest J.P. Garber D.W. Brouillette C.G. Harvey S.C. Anantharamaiah G.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 303-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This model of association is consistent with recent studies examining the interaction of class A amphipathic peptides with phospholipid bilayers (39.Clayton A.H.A. Sawyer W.H. Eur. Biophys. J. 1999; 28: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and thus suggests that arginines 167, 178 and 180 would interact with the phospholipid head groups on the phospholipid disc. However, Arg172 is positioned in the center of the polar face of the helix, where it may be available to interact with other residues in apoE or other proteins (e.g. the LDL receptor) rather than phospholipid head groups. When residues 186–201 (167′–182′) are modeled as an α-helix, Arg189 (170′) is on the opposite side of the helix from Arg191 (172′), and one could predict that the position of Arg191 (172′) would shift by approximately 90° relative to Arg172 in apoE3, so that Arg189 (170′) and Arg191 (172′) would lie at the phospholipid interface (Fig. 5). Thus, the potential interactions of Arg191 (172′) with other amino acid residues would be altered compared with Arg172 in apoE3. Additionally, this stretch of residues is not very amphipathic. While one side of the putative helix contains polar and charged residues, and Arg189 (170′) and Arg191 (172′) may define the polar-nonpolar interface, the nonpolar face is not very hydrophobic, containing only one valine and a few alanine residues; therefore, its potential orientation on or association with phospholipid is questionable. Alternatively, it is possible that residues 186–201 are not helical and that the receptor-binding results may be explained by a disruption of secondary structure in this region. If residues in the vicinity of Arg191 (172′) are helical, we speculated that we could further modulate receptor binding activity of apoE3Δ167–185 by mutating arginine to alanine at positions 189 (170′) and 191 (172′). To assess this possibility, we created three additional point mutations (apoE3Δ167–185 R189A, apoE3Δ167–185 R191A, and apoE3Δ167–185 R189A,R191A) and tested them for receptor binding activity (Fig. 6, Table I). ApoE3Δ167–185 R189A had increased binding activity (54% of apoE3). Loss of Arg189 (170′) may have allowed Arg191(172′) to shift close to the position Arg172 may occupy in intact apoE3. This result implies that residues 186–201 or a short segment within this region is probably helical. ApoE3Δ167–185 R191A (R172′A) had approximately 15% of the binding activity of apoE3. Without Arg191 (172′) at the opposite side of the helix, Arg189 (170′) may partially compensate for the loss of the Arg at 191 (172′), although poorly. The double mutant (apoE3Δ167–185 R189A,R191A) displayed only 1% of receptor binding activity, similar to the R172A mutation in intact apoE3. The results of these mutagenesis studies show that Arg172is important for LDL receptor binding activity; they also imply that its proper orientation, relative to the receptor-binding region, is critical. The structure of the receptor-active conformation of apoE is not known, but it does require association with phospholipids (40.Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4186-4190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One hypothesis is that the four-helix bundle of the apoE 22-kDa fragment opens up when associating with phospholipid, promoting proper conformation of the receptor-binding region in apoE (4.Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These current studies also suggest the possibility that phospholipids promote the correct positioning of Arg172 so that it can interact directly with the ligand-binding region of the LDL receptor or with other residues of apoE to maintain an active conformation of the apoE receptor-binding region. However, precisely how Arg172affects receptor binding activity cannot be established until the structure of apoE3 on phospholipid has been determined. We thank John C. W.

https://openalex.org/W2016308371,"Members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family as well as other receptors achieve their diverse biological effects through the activation of intracellular signals including the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. Such signals are believed to be delivered through mediators known as TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs). Although the N-terminal zinc finger region of TRAFs has been shown to be essential for downstream signaling, there is no indication yet as to the nature of its role or of the factors that distinguish the N terminus of TRAF 3, which does not activate JNK in the systems examined thus far, from those of other TRAFs, which do activate this pathway. In the present study, it is shown that, among the known TRAFs, localization to the insoluble cell pellet fraction consistently correlates with JNK activation and that both characteristics map to the TRAF N terminus. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that forced localization of TRAF 3 to the cell membrane is sufficient to convert this molecule into an activator of JNK. This suggests that one of the roles of the TRAF N terminus may be to participate in interactions that promote the recruitment of TRAFs to the membrane and that this localization effect plays an important role in TRAF-mediated JNK activation.

Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). These receptors are believed to mediate at least part of their effects by influencing the transcriptional regulation of downstream target genes through the activation of specific intracellular signaling pathways including the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) and NF-κB pathways (2.Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar, 3.Baeuerle P. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2910) Google Scholar). Both of these pathways consist of serine/threonine kinase cascades, which lead to the activation of specific transcription factors, including Jun and the Rel family of transcription factors, respectively. The JNKs are members of a large family of MAP kinases that also include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases and p38 kinases (4.Kyriakis J. Avruch J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). All MAP kinases are activated by roughly parallel kinase cascades, leading to the dual-specificity phosphorylation of the MAP kinase, which in turn phosphorylates and activates specific transcription factors. The extracellular signal-regulated kinases are traditionally believed to respond to growth-promoting stimuli such as growth factors, whereas the JNKs and p38 kinases are components of stress response pathways activated by conditions such as ultraviolet irradiation and osmotic stress. The activation of JNK by members of the TNFR family is thought to be mediated by a family of intracellular signaling molecules known as TNFR-associated factors (TRAFs) (5.Arch R. Gedrich R. Thompson C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The TRAF family currently consists of six members, and studies in knockout and transgenic mice have demonstrated that at least one member of this family, TRAF 2, is required for TNF-mediated JNK activation (6.Lee S. Reichlin A. Santana A. Sokol K. Nussenzweig M. Choi Y. Immunity. 1997; 7: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 7.Yeh W. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J.

Different members of this family display distinct receptor binding specificities, and one member, TRAF 6, is believed to mediate NF-κB and JNK activation by the interleukin 1 receptor (8.Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar, 9.Lomaga M.A. Yeh W.-C. Sarosi I. Duncan G.S. Furlonger C. Ho A. Morony S.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar), which is not a member of the TNFR family. Thus, TRAF-mediated activation of these pathways may be a common mechanism shared by many cell-surface receptors. Since TRAFs have no enzymatic activity, the biochemical mechanism by which they activate JNK is not presently clear; however, certain TRAF-interacting kinases may play a role in this process. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK1), a MAP 3-kinase that is believed to activate JNK and p38 kinases, has been shown to interact with and become activated by TRAFs (10.Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 3: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (566) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested that members of the germinal center kinase family link TRAFs to the JNK pathway through MEKK1, another MAP 3-kinase (11.Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J. Kyriakis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 12.Shi C. Kehrl J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 6665-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Structurally, TRAFs are defined by a unique C-terminal domain, the TRAF domain, that mediates interactions with a large number of other signaling molecules, including apoptosis signal-regulating kinase NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), receptor-interacting protein (RIP), and TNF receptor-associated death domain protein (TRADD) (5.Arch R. Gedrich R. Thompson C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 10.Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 3: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (566) Google Scholar), as well as with the intracellular domains of receptors. In addition, all TRAFs, except TRAF 1, contain a predicted N-terminal zinc finger region containing a ring finger and five tandem zinc fingers. Although the biochemical function of this region is not yet clear, it has been shown to be necessary for the activation of downstream signaling (14.Takeuchi M. Rothe M. Goeddel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19935-19942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). We have recently dissected the contribution of this region to the activation of each of two downstream signaling pathways by demonstrating that the ring finger is specifically required for NF-κB but not JNK activation (15.Dadgostar H. Cheng G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24775-24780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Among members of the TRAF family, TRAFs 2, 3, 5, and 6 have been studied most extensively as mediators of receptor-activated signal transduction. It is interesting that despite a lack of any obvious structural differences within the N-terminal zinc finger region, TRAFs 2, 5, and 6 can activate downstream signaling pathways such as the JNK pathway, whereas TRAF 3 cannot (16.Song H. Regnier C. Kirschning C. Goeddel D. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 17.Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Through domain exchanges between homologous regions of different TRAF molecules, this functional difference between TRAF 3 and the other TRAFs has been mapped within the zinc finger region (14.Takeuchi M. Rothe M. Goeddel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19935-19942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 15.Dadgostar H. Cheng G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24775-24780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Since all known interactions between TRAFs and other proteins are mediated by the TRAF C terminus, the nature of the zinc finger region's contribution to signaling is not clear. In the present study, we examined the significance of the N-terminal sequence difference that functionally distinguishes TRAF 3 from other TRAFs in the activation of JNK signaling. We found that those TRAFs that activate JNK localize to the insoluble pellet fraction after cell lysis, whereas TRAF 3 distributes preferentially to the soluble cytoplasmic fraction, and that this distribution preference maps precisely to the same zinc finger region that is important for signaling. Furthermore, we suggest that localization to the cell membrane distinguishes TRAF 3 from other TRAFs, since forced membrane localization of TRAF 3 is sufficient to convert it to a potent activator of JNK. All full-length TRAFs were cloned between the BamHI and NotI sites in pEBB, a mammalian expression vector driven by the elongation factor-1α promoter. TRAF 3/TRAF 5 hybrids were generated by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis, as described previously (18.Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar), and cloned between the BamHI and NotI sites in pEBB. The Ikaros construct, expressed from the pCMV expression vector, was kindly provided by Dr. Stephen Smale (University of California, Los Angeles, CA), and for CD40ct-Ikaros-C, the CD40 cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 216–277) was cloned between KpnI and EcoRI in-frame with an N-terminal Flag tag and a C-terminal Ikaros-C zinc finger domain (amino acids 223–286 of Ikaros I). For myr-CD40ct-Ikaros-C, the CD40ct-Ikaros-C fusion was polymerase chain reaction-amplified and cloned between the NotI andXhoI sites in pCNDA3-myr, in-frame with a 16-amino acid N-terminal src myristoylation signal (MGSSKSKPKDPSQRRR). GST-CD40ct was generated by cloning the CD40 cytoplasmic tail into theBamHI and NotI sites of the pEBG expression vector, in-frame with an N-terminal GST tag. Murine TRAF 3 and TRAF 3 N terminus (amino acids 1–294) were polymerase chain reaction-amplified and cloned between EcoRI and BamHI in pCDNA3-myr. For myr-TF3N-Ikaros-C, the Ikaros-C domain was cloned into an XhoI site just C-terminal to and in-frame with TRAF 3-N. The HA-JNK expression vector used for measuring in vitro kinase activity was described previously (15.Dadgostar H. Cheng G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24775-24780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). 293T cells derived from human embryonic kidney were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin, streptomycin. About 2 × 106 cells were transiently transfected with 4 μg of TRAF, CD40ct, or control vector (except as indicated) and 2 μg of HA-JNK expression vector using a standard calcium phosphate method, and extracts were collected about 36 h after transfection. Lysis of transiently transfected cells was performed on ice using a modified radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, and 1 mmNa3VO4 and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the cytoplasmic supernatant was removed. Cell pellets were washed in the same buffer and completely dissolved in standard protein sample buffer containing SDS by sonication for 8–10 s using a Sonic Dismembrator 550 (Fisher). Equivalent dilutions (representing equal numbers of cells) of the cytoplasmic and pellet samples were prepared for Western blot analysis of TRAF distribution. Whole cell extracts from 10% of the cells were also prepared by lysis in protein sample buffer. Lysis of Jurkat, HeLa, and HaCaT cells for fractionation of endogenous TRAFs was performed on ice using a lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After lysis, pellets were washed, and nuclear proteins were removed by incubating on ice for 30 min in a hypertonic buffer containing 25% glycerol (v/v), 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.6 mKCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm EDTA. Pellets were washed twice more and subsequently dissolved by sonication in standard protein sample buffer as described above. JNK activity was measured as described previously (19.Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). Briefly, HA-JNK was immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody and protein A/G-agarose beads. An immune-complex in vitro kinase assay was performed using 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP with 1 μg of recombinant GST-c-Jun (amino acids 1–79) as substrate. Recombinant GST-c-Jun was resolved on a 9% acrylamide gel, and the extent of phosphorylation was determined by autoradiography. Early in the course of studies on the mechanisms of downstream signaling by the various TRAF family members, we observed that when cells were transfected with equal amounts of vectors encoding the different TRAFs, there were great differences in the levels of overexpressed protein detectable in cytoplasmic extracts. Moreover, the relative differences in protein level detectable by Western blot were consistent for each TRAF family member across many experiments and under different lysis buffer conditions. Since all of these proteins were being expressed from the same promoter on the same expression vector and detected using the same antibody and epitope tag, there were two potential explanations for the observed results that were considered most reasonable. The first was that the different TRAFs have different intracellular half-lives, and the second was that the differences in protein levels in cytoplasmic extracts actually reflected differences in solubility between the TRAFs. To test the second hypothesis, we transiently transfected 293T cells with equal amounts of vectors encoding HA-tagged TRAFs 2, 2A, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (Fig. 1). Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared using standard protocols, and a sample was taken for Western blot analysis. In addition, the pellet fractions were washed, dissolved, and sonicated to break up membranes and insoluble particles. Matching dilutions of cytoplasmic and pellet extracts (representing roughly the same number of cells) were prepared and analyzed for TRAF protein content by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1, there is a clear difference in solubility between the various TRAFs, with TRAF 3 being the most soluble, whereas the other TRAFs are, to varying extents, localized preferentially to the insoluble pellet fraction. When JNK activation by these TRAFs is measured through an in vitro kinase assay, we observe an inverse correlation between the activation of this pathway and the level of TRAF solubility. That is, TRAFs that activate JNK signaling tend to distribute to the insoluble pellet during cytoplasmic extraction, thus explaining the lower levels detected in cytoplasmic samples. The above analyses of transiently transfected cells demonstrate that the solubility of TRAF 3 upon cell lysis differs from that of other TRAFs. We wished to determine if this was also true for endogenous expression levels of TRAF molecules. For this purpose, we prepared cytoplasmic and pellet extracts from three distinct cell lines representing distinct tissues: Jurkat cells (a human T cell line), HeLa cells (a human cervical carcinoma line), and HaCaT cells (a transformed human keratinocyte line). Western blot analysis was performed to determine the levels of TRAF 2 and TRAF 3 in each fraction. As shown in Fig. 2, in all three cell lines, a significant fraction of endogenous TRAF 2 was found in the insoluble pellet fraction after removal of nuclear proteins and extensive washing. TRAF 3, on the other hand, is almost entirely localized to the soluble cytoplasmic fraction and scarcely detectable in the pellet. Thus, in multiple cell types, TRAF 2 can be fractionated with the pellet, as demonstrated above in transiently transfected 293T cells, whereas TRAF 3 was found almost entirely in the cytoplasmic extract. We decided to map the region that accounts for the difference in solubility between TRAFs 3 and 5 through domain substitutions. For this purpose, a panel of TRAF 3/5 hybrids were constructed in which different regions were contributed by TRAFs 3 and 5 (Fig. 3 A). These hybrid molecules were expressed in 293T cells, and pellet and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described above. As shown in Fig.3 B, there was a shift in localization from the cytoplasm to the pellet as an increasing contribution to the hybrid was made by TRAF 5 sequence. Specifically, TF 35/250, which contained the entire TRAF 3 N-terminal zinc binding region and the isoleucine zipper and TRAF domains of TRAF 5, showed no preferential distribution to the pellet fraction; however, substituting the last three zinc fingers with those of TRAF 5 so that only the ring finger and first two zinc fingers were contributed by TRAF 3 (TF 35/162), resulted in a clearly higher level of protein in the pellet than in the cytoplasm. This preferential localization to the pellet fraction again correlates well with the ability of these proteins to activate JNK signaling, suggesting that the TRAF N-terminal zinc binding region plays an important role in both of these effects. We had previously used domain swapping between TRAF 3 and TRAF 5 to generate a series of chimeric molecules designed to identify the minimum region that distinguishes TRAFs 3 and 5 in terms of downstream signaling activity (15.Dadgostar H. Cheng G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24775-24780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In Fig. 4, we examined the partitioning of these molecules between the cytoplasmic and pellet fractions and found once again that those constructs which distribute preferentially to the pellet are the ones which activate JNK. The first zinc finger and the first 10 amino acids of the second zinc finger of TRAF 5 are able to convert TRAF 3 into a JNK activator (TF 353/110–148), and this same region was sufficient to direct this construct to the pellet fraction. Interestingly, TF 35/162 did not contain this region of TRAF 5 and yet still strongly activated JNK; however, as mentioned above, the last three zinc fingers of this construct were contributed by TRAF 5 (Fig. 3 A). Thus, it appears that multiple zinc fingers in the TRAF N terminus may contribute to both JNK activation and pellet localization, and only when all five zinc fingers are contributed by TRAF 3 is there a dramatic reduction in both of these effects. Based on the association between pellet fractionation and JNK activity as well as the fact that both features map to the TRAF N-terminal zinc finger region, we suspected that both effects may be a result of TRAF subcellular localization. Since TRAFs are believed to act immediately downstream of TNF family receptors, it seemed likely that localization to the plasma membrane may be a key component in TRAF signal transduction. To directly test the role of membrane localization in TRAF-mediated JNK activation, we decided to determine if it would be possible to produce a gain of function in a TRAF that normally does not activate JNK (TRAF 3; Fig. 1) by forcing it to the membrane. This was accomplished by attaching an N-terminal myristoylation signal to TRAF 3. As shown in Fig. 5, myristyolated TRAF 3 localized to the pellet fraction and was capable of activating JNK signaling. If the TRAF 3 N-terminal zinc finger region was forced to the membrane, it too was capable of activating JNK; however, this activity was far weaker than that observed with full-length myr-TRAF 3, suggesting that even in the context of the membrane, the TRAF C terminus plays a key role in signaling. Since the C-terminal half of TRAFs has been shown to be important for TRAF-TRAF interaction as well as interactions between TRAFs and TNF receptors (5.Arch R. Gedrich R. Thompson C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), which are believed to trimerize upon activation, we sought to determine if the function of the TRAF C terminus could be replaced by another self-interacting domain. For this purpose, we used a construct in which the C-terminal domain of myr-TRAF 3 was replaced by the two C-terminal zinc fingers of the Ikaros transcription factor. The multiple splice variants of this transcription factor differ in their N-terminal zinc finger domains, which are important for nuclear localization and DNA binding; however, the invariable C-terminal domain consists of two zinc fingers, which mediate self-association between subunits of this transcription factor (20.Georgopoulos K. Winandy S. Avitahl N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 155-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, myr-TF3N-Ikaros-C was a strong activator of JNK, suggesting that oligomerization as well as membrane localization of the TRAF N terminus was important for TRAF signaling. The CD40 antigen as well as many other members of the TNFR superfamily are believed to signal through the direct binding of TRAFs to their intracellular domains. Furthermore, many of these receptors are believed to bind to trimeric ligands, which activate the receptors by trimerizing them (1.Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). To determine if the same factors affecting signaling by the TRAF N terminus are also important for signaling by the CD40 cytoplasmic tail, we generated various constructs containing this domain and tested JNK activation. As shown in Fig. 6, intracellular expression of the CD40 cytoplasmic domain coupled to a GST epitope tag was, by itself, not sufficient to activate JNK signaling. If, however, this domain was linked to the Ikaros oligomerization domain described above (CD40ct-Ikaros-C; Fig. 6), it was capable of activating JNK. Finally, if the oligomerized CD40 cytoplasmic tail was also forced to the membrane using an N-terminal myristoylation signal, its signaling ability was greatly enhanced. Since their discovery as mediators of TNFR and CD40 signaling, the TRAFs have grown both in number and in recognition as key signaling molecules activating pathways downstream of many members of the TNFR superfamily. Recent studies on knockout and transgenic models highlight the prominent role of the TRAF family in the activation of multiple pathways by many receptors. For instance, in TRAF 2-deficient mice as well as mice expressing a dominant-negative TRAF 2 mutant in lymphoid tissues, TNFR-mediated JNK signaling is lost, suggesting an essential role for TRAF 2 in this pathway (6.Lee S. Reichlin A. Santana A. Sokol K. Nussenzweig M. Choi Y. Immunity. 1997; 7: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 7.Yeh W. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D. Mak T. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). More recently, TRAF 6-deficient mice were shown to have defects in interleukin 1-mediated JNK signaling as well as interleukin 1-, anti-CD40-, and lipopolysaccharide-mediated NF-κB signaling (9.Lomaga M.A. Yeh W.-C. Sarosi I. Duncan G.S. Furlonger C. Ho A. Morony S. Capparelli C. Van G. Kaufman S. van der Heiden A. Itie A. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Sasaki T. Cao Z. Penninger J.M. Paige C.J. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Boyle W.J. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). In addition to demonstrating the importance of TRAFs in signaling, such studies also point to some of the nonredundant biological functions of different members of this family in different tissues. For instance, both TRAF 2- and TRAF 3-deficient mice undergo severe wasting and early post-natal death, and TRAF 3-deficient lymphocytes show defects in T-dependent immune responses (21.Xu Y. Cheng G. Baltimore D. Immunity. 1996; 5: 407-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), whereas TRAF 6-deficient mice survive but develop severe osteopetrosis. Despite their different biological functions, the predicted structural similarities between these molecules and the fact that they activate similar downstream signaling pathways such as the NF-κB and JNK pathways suggest that they may function similarly at the biochemical level. The nature of their specific biochemical role in signaling is, however, still poorly understood. Like the receptors with which they interact, TRAFs have no enzymatic activity through which to modify downstream molecules, and thus, they are believed to act as adapters that bring key molecules together at the appropriate time. Within the context of such a role, however, there is not yet any clear indication of why TRAF 3 differs from other TRAFs such as TRAFs 2, 5, and 6 in its ability to activate downstream pathways such as the JNK pathway. Although an increasingly large number of signaling molecules are known to interact with TRAFs, none of these interactions consistently distinguishes TRAF 3 from those family members that activate downstream signaling. Similarly, no obvious structural differences can account for this difference in activity, in contrast to the case of TRAF 1, which lacks the N-terminal ring and zinc finger region necessary for signaling activity. By studying factors that can result in a gain of signaling function for TRAF 3, we learn about the features that distinguish TRAF 3 from other TRAFs and also gain insight into the overall mechanism of TRAF signaling. Previous work identified the first zinc finger and nearby sequences as the key structural feature accounting for the difference in function between TRAF 3 and its close homologue, TRAF 5, and also demonstrated distinct structural requirements for NF-κB and JNK signaling (15.Dadgostar H. Cheng G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24775-24780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present study, a similar domain substitution approach is used to show that the ability to activate JNK correlates with preferential localization to the insoluble pellet fraction during cell lysis (Figs. 3 and 4). Indeed, for all members of the TRAF family that have such an N-terminal zinc finger region, the ability to activate JNK correlates consistently with the tendency to localize to the pellet fraction (Fig. 1). Even expression of TRAF 4 leads to modest activation of JNK activity above base line; however, this molecule is typically not compared with other TRAFs because, unlike other family members, TRAF 4 has a tendency to localize to the nucleus (22.Regnier C. Tomasetto C. Moog-Lutz C. Chenard M. Wendling C. Basset P. Rio M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25715-25721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Although the significance of this nuclear distribution is not fully appreciated at this time, it is likely that this distribution pattern contributes to the abundant levels of TRAF 4 that are detected in the pellet fraction (Fig. 1). A similar trend was observed when we compare the fractionation of endogenous TRAF 2 and TRAF 3 in three distinct cell types (Fig. 2). Although a large amount of both proteins was detected in the cytoplasmic fraction, a significant amount of TRAF 2 was associated with the pellet, whereas in the same sample, TRAF 3 was nearly undetectable, suggesting a solubility difference between these proteins at physiological expression levels. Pellet localization maps to the N-terminal zinc finger region (Figs. 3and 4), which is required for JNK activation. This finding is surprising in light of the fact that the C-terminal TRAF domain is the region responsible for interaction with receptor cytoplasmic tails (5.Arch R. Gedrich R. Thompson C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar); however, it is consistent with the observation that both TRAF 2 and TRAF 3 interact strongly with the intracellular domain of CD40, but only TRAF 2 can activate JNK signaling (23.Lee H. Dempsey P. Parks T. Zhu X. Baltimore D. Cheng G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1421-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). One might speculate that among other uncharacterized molecular interactions, the N termini of some TRAFs may contribute to their localization to the membrane and help to recruit signaling molecules important for JNK activation to the receptor, with which the TRAFs interact through their C-terminal domains. Since the initial characterization of TRAFs, the function of the zinc finger region has remained a mystery. Zinc fingers are classically mediators of DNA binding, and some evidence indicates a potential transcriptional role for the TRAF 2 N terminus under some conditions (24.Min W. Bradley J. Galbraith J. Jones S. Ledgerwood E. Pober J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 319-324PubMed Google Scholar). Zinc fingers have, however, also been shown to mediate protein/protein interactions (25.Mackay J. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), and soon after their discovery, most TRAFs were shown to be located outside the nucleus (5.Arch R. Gedrich R. Thompson C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), consistent with roles as adapter molecules. The present work suggests that localization of TRAFs to the cell membrane would account for at least part of the well documented essential signaling role of the zinc finger region. In the present study, we show that those TRAFs that activated JNK localized to the insoluble pellet fraction during cytoplasmic extraction, whereas TRAF 3 was predominantly in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 1). To test if membrane localization is important for TRAF signaling, we forced TRAF 3 to the plasma membrane through the addition of a myristoylation signal, and we found that, like the other TRAFs, it became localized predominantly to the pellet and gained the ability to activate JNK (Fig. 5). This suggests that membrane localization is one factor that accounts for the difference between TRAF 3 and other TRAFs and also indicates that when TRAF 3 is localized to the membrane, it can behave like other TRAFs in JNK activation: potentially through similar molecular interactions. Although membrane localization through myristoylation certainly changes the activity of TRAF 3, it is not certain at this point if membrane localizationper se is truly responsible for the observed change in solubility. For instance, the low solubility of certain TRAFs may be a result of their association with cytoskeletal scaffolding components with roles in signaling, and forced membrane localization of TRAF 3 may bring it into proximity with such proteins near the cell membrane, thus accounting for both its signaling activity and its localization to the insoluble pellet fraction. Although current evidence suggests that TRAF 3 is incapable of activating JNK, it is too early to rule out this possibility altogether, since this conclusion is based primarily on overexpression studies. Here, we demonstrate that the cytoplasm-to-pellet distribution ratio of overexpressed TRAF 3 is higher than that of other TRAFs and that this ratio varies inversely with the ability to activate JNK. Perhaps the large amount of cytoplasmic TRAF 3 in these studies interferes with signaling by the small amount that localizes to the membrane (possibly by competing for important signaling molecules that must get recruited to the membrane), and this makes it appear that TRAF 3 is incapable of JNK activation. TRAF 3 has been reported to interact with a number of receptors including CD40, RANK, lymphotoxin-β receptor (LT-βR), and the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) (26.Cheng G. Cleary A.M. Ye Z. Hong D.I. Lederman S. Baltimore D. Science. 1995; 267: 1494-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 27.Mosialos G. Birkenbach M. Yalamanchili R. VanArsdale T. Ware C. Kieff E. Cell. 1995; 80: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 28.Wong B.R. Josien R. Lee S.Y. Vologodskaia M. Steinman R.M. Choi Y. J. Biol.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2460-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and it is possible that upon recruitment to the membrane by an activated receptor, TRAF 3 may be capable of activating JNK as well as other pathways. In fact it has been shown that overexpression of the TRAF domain of TRAF 3 can act as a dominant negative inhibitor of CD40-mediated JNK activation (30.Grammer A. Swantek J. McFarland R. Miura Y. Geppert T. Lipsky P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1183-1193PubMed Google Scholar); however, this possibility must be investigated further since this effect may be the result of an inhibition of binding of TRAF 2 or 5 to the receptor. Members of the TNFR superfamily are believed to interact with trimeric ligands and thus undergo oligomerization during the activation process (1.Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). We confirm the importance of receptor oligomerization for CD40 by showing that oligomerization of the CD40 cytoplasmic tail through fusion to the Ikaros self-association domain leads to JNK activation (Fig. 6). Since the CD40 cytoplasmic domain is believed to act immediately upstream of TRAFs, we also showed, in agreement with the above findings, that localization of this oligomerized cytoplasmic tail to the membrane, presumably mimicking its natural activation state, made it far more efficient at signaling. Cytoplasmic expression of a GST-tagged CD40 cytoplasmic tail, on the other hand, failed to activate JNK to any appreciable extent. This is interesting since GST has been claimed to form dimers (31.Ji X. Zhang P. Armstrong R. Gilliland G.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10169-10184Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), and it may mean that this dimerization is too weak to activate signaling or that higher-order oligomers are required for signaling. In support of the latter possibility, the Ikaros self-association domain has been suggested to form higher-order oligomers (20.Georgopoulos K. Winandy S. Avitahl N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 155-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Interestingly, GST-CD40ct is also unable to significantly inhibit signaling by activated wild-type CD40 when coexpressed (data not shown), suggesting that a nonoligomerized, intracytoplasmic CD40 cytoplasmic domain cannot effectively compete for important signaling molecules with a membrane-bound receptor that has been oligomerized by its ligand. Again, this points to the cell membrane as a key location for molecular interactions that contribute to receptor-mediated JNK activation. Recent crystallographic analysis of TRAF 2 reveals that TRAFs form trimers through interactions between their TRAF domains and that each monomer can interact with a single TNFR cytoplasmic domain (32.Park Y. Burkitt V. Villa A. Tong L. Wu H. Nature. 1999; 398: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Thus a single TNFR trimer may recruit as many as nine TRAF molecules, six of which can potentially interact with other receptor cytoplasmic tails, making it possible to aggregate a large number of TRAFs at the membrane in an active receptor complex. As adapter molecules, TRAF aggregates may then recruit, and thus locally concentrate, downstream kinases such as GCKR and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase to the signaling complex so that these kinases may be activated by other TRAF-interacting kinases or may activate themselves through transphosphorylation. Our results support such a mechanism for TRAF activity by demonstrating that the TRAF 3 N terminus is capable of only weak JNK activation when localized to the membrane (Fig. 5); however, when this domain is fused to the Ikaros-C oligomerization domain, there is a striking increase in JNK activation. Thus, localization of TRAFs at or near the membrane may bring them into proximity with receptors and other signaling molecules without actually activating signaling in an unstimulated cell. After receptor oligomerization, TRAFs associating with the receptors would cluster together to activate signaling. Overexpressed TRAFs may activate signaling independently of receptor activation simply because their high expression levels may lead to spontaneous self-association through their TRAF domains, which have been shown to mediate TRAF-TRAF interactions (5.Arch R. Gedrich R. Thompson C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Others have also recently demonstrated an important role for TRAF oligomerization in signaling by fusing FK506-binding protein to the TRAF 2 N terminus for inducible oligomerization of this domain (33.Baud V. Liu Z. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this study also demonstrated the sedimentation of MEKK1, a MAP 3-kinase with a reported role in JNK activation (34.Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar), with the oligomerized TRAF 2 N terminus in the insoluble fraction, suggesting that MEKK1 interacts directly with the TRAF N terminus, or it is recruited to a signaling complex that is aggregated by TRAF oligomerization. Given the prominent role of TRAFs in signaling by members of the TNFR superfamily, any basic appreciation of the mechanisms by which the TNF receptors, CD40 or any of their relatives mediate their biological functions will require an understanding of the ways in which TRAFs link these receptors to the signaling pathways that they activate. In the present work, we suggest that membrane localization may play an important role in TRAF-mediated JNK activation. It will be important to further establish the importance of membrane localization in this pathway and to identify other molecules in the TRAF signaling complex, particularly those recruited by the TRAF N terminus.

In mammals the outermost bulwark of this barrier is the cornified layer of the epidermis, composed of flattened corneocytes mortared together by orderly lipid laminae. During terminal differentiation, individual corneocytes acquire a specialized cell peripheral structure termed the cornified cell envelope (CE),1 which is responsible for maintenance of mechanical and chemical protection and indirectly contributes to water permeability barrier (see Refs. 1.Nemes Z. Steinert P.M. Exp. Mol. Med. 1999; 3: 5-19Crossref Scopus (441) Google Scholar and2.Ishida-Yamamoto A. Iizuka H. Exp. Dermatol. 1998; 7: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, for reviews). The CE is composed of two parts. The ∼10 nm thick protein envelope is formed by covalent cross-linking of several structural proteins by sulfhydryl oxidases and transglutaminases (TGases). This highly insoluble protein meshwork is coated by the lipid envelope, a ∼5 nm thick layer of ω-hydroxyceramides with uniquely long (C28-C36) fatty acyl moieties (3.Wertz P.W. Downing D.T. Goldsmith L.A. Physiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of the Skin. 1. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 205-236Google Scholar). These are covalently attached by ester bonds through their ω-hydroxyl group to selected glutamines to envoplakin, periplakin, and involucrin components of the protein envelope (4.Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17763-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Terminal differentiation of keratinocytes is accompanied by vigorous lipid metabolism and synthesis of keratinization-specific lipids in the granular layer. Newly synthesized lipids are temporarily stored in cytoplasmic lamellar bodies, in which they are arranged as stacks of tetralaminar sheets. The lamellar body lipids consist largely of free fatty acids, (glucosyl)ceramides, cholesterol, and its acyl or sulfate esters (3.Wertz P.W. Downing D.T. Goldsmith L.A. Physiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of the Skin. 1. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 205-236Google Scholar). In the uppermost granular layer the lamellar bodies fuse with the cell membrane, and release their contents which assume broad, multilamellar lipid sheets between corneocytes. This process approximately coincides with the initiation of assembly of both the protein envelope and lipid envelope of the CE (5.Wertz P.W. Exper. Suppl. (Basel). 1997; 78: 227-237PubMed Google Scholar). It is thought that the ester-linked long chain ω-hydroxyceramides comprising the lipid bound envelope interdigitate with the interstitial lipid layers and might function in a Velcro-like fashion by fixing the protein envelope to surrounding lipid structures, and vice versa. In this way, the lipid bound envelope contributes to the maintenance of an orderly array of lipid layers during normal wear and tear and mechanical stress of the epidermis. Genetic errors of CE and skin barrier formation can manifest as ichthyosiform symptoms. Some of these diseases have been distinguished on the basis of abnormal metabolism of stratum corneum lipids (6.Steinberg D.S. Stanbury J.B. Wyngaarden J.B. Frederickson D.S.

Some congenital ichthyoses reveal abnormal deposition of apolar or polar lipids or cholesterol in the intercorneocyte lipid layers, and thereby appear to disrupt the normal lipid layerings and composition required for effective epidermal barrier function (8.Anton-Lamprecht I. Papadimitrou J.M. Henderson D.W. Spagnolo D.V. Diagnostic Ultrastructure of Non-neoplastic Diseases. Churchill Livingstone, New York1992: 459-551Google Scholar). These include recessive X-linked ichthyosis (XI) which is caused by an accumulation of excess cholesterol 3-sulfate (CSO4) owing to arylsulfatase C/cholesterol sulfatase enzyme defects (9.Shapiro L.J.

CSO4 is a ubiquitous cholesterol metabolite, the amount of which is determined by the relative activity of cholesterol sulfotransferase and cholesterol sulfatase enzymes (10.Epstein E.H.

CSO4 gradually accumulates during epidermal keratinocyte differentiation, peaking normally at levels of 4–5% of total lipids in the upper stratum granulosum and it is hydrolyzed in the cornified layer, so that normal corneocyte scales contain less than 1% CSO4 of total lipids (11.Ranasinghe A.W. Wertz P.W. Downing D.T. Mackenzie I.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1986; 86: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 12.Long S.A. Wertz P.W. Strauss J.S. Downing D.T. Arch Dermatol. Res. 1985; 277: 284-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In XI the lack of its breakdown results in an elevated CSO4 content in the basal and spinous layers, peaking at >10% (by weight) of total lipids in the stratum corneum (13.Williams M.L. Semin. Dermatol. 1992; 11: 169-175PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not yet clear how excessive epidermal CSO4diminishes barrier function in the epidermis, and whether the mild increase of epidermal (water) permeability alone is sufficient to account for the severe symptoms of the disease. Several published reports have addressed the alterations of physical properties of corneocyte lipids from excess CSO4 (14.Rehfeld S.J. Williams M.L. Elias P.M. Arch Dermatol. Res. 1986; 278: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15.Rehfeld S.J. Plachy W.Z. Williams M.L. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1988; 91: 499-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Zettersten E. Man M.Q. Sato J. Denda M. Farrell A. Ghadially R. Williams M.L. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 784-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It has been shown that CSO4 can cause phase separation of cholesterol-fatty acid layers (14.Rehfeld S.J. Williams M.L. Elias P.M. Arch Dermatol. Res. 1986; 278: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and that the XI phenotype can be ameliorated by topical cholesterol treatment (17.Lykkesfeldt G. Hoyer H. Lancet. 1983; 2: 1337-1338Abstract PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus it was suggested that XI arises due to a defect of intercorneocyte lipid layer formation. In a conceptually related argument, CSO4 was shown to interfere with spontaneous sheet formation of epidermal lipidsin vivo, perhaps due to the strong charge of its sulfate moiety conferring detergent properties to CSO4. Thus it was theorized that CSO4 affects epidermal barrier function both by deranging skin lipid layers and by replacing cholesterol in the lipid sheets (16.Zettersten E. Man M.Q. Sato J. Denda M. Farrell A. Ghadially R. Williams M.L. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 784-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In another study, it was proposed that since CSO4 has trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitory propertiesin vitro, it might thereby affect breakdown of desmosomes, thus causing retention hyperkeratosis and abnormal scaling (18.Sato J. Denda M. Nakanishi J. Nomura J. Koyama J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 189-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Finally, more recently, it was demonstrated that CSO4 can induce TGase 1 expression in cultured keratinocytes (19.Kawabe S. Ikuta T. Ohba M. Chida K. Ueda E. Yamanishi K. Kuroki T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 1098-1102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but the connection between excess TGase expression and disease etiology remains unclear. CSO4 in keratinocyte membranes was shown to activate the protein kinase C isoforms ε, ζ, and η, presumably by direct allosteric effects on their tertiary structures. As these membrane-bound enzymes are involved in the signaling pathways of keratinocyte differentiation (20.Chida K. Murakami A. Tagawa T. Ikuta T. Kuroki T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4865-4869PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Ikuta T. Chida K. Tajima O. Matsuura Y. Iwamori M. Ueda Y. Mizuno K. Ohno S. Kuroki T. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 943-947PubMed Google Scholar), CSO4 could induce TGase 1 expression in this way (19.Kawabe S. Ikuta T. Ohba M. Chida K. Ueda E. Yamanishi K. Kuroki T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 1098-1102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Mammalian TGases (glutamyl-amine aminotransferases, EC 2.3.2.13) constitute an evolutionarily related family of Ca2+-dependent enzymes (22.Polakowska R.R. Eickbush T. Falciano V. Razvi F. Goldsmith L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4476-4480Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism of TGases involves the release of ammonia from the reactive glutamine residues, and the residual glutamyl moieties form an acyl-enzyme thioester, a labile intermediate susceptible to nucleophilic attack by primary amines, notably ε-amino groups from protein bound lysines (formingN ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine isopeptide cross-links), or polyamines (resulting inN,N′-bis(γ-glutamyl)polyamine cross-links (23.Folk J.E. Finlayson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1977; 31: 1-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar,24.Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). However, the thioester intermediate can also be transferred to primary alcohols (25.Gross M. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3021-3025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Parameswaran K.N. Lorand L. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3703-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have shown that in the epidermis, the terminal (ω) hydroxyl group of ω-hydroxyceramides is an effective substrate for membrane-bound TGase 1, and this route links these lipids to protein-bound glutamines by an ester bond (27.Nemes Z. Marekov L.N. Fésüs L. Steinert P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8402-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Lastly, water can also enter the active site of TGases to attack the acyl-enzyme intermediate, which leads to a net deamidation of a reactive glutamine to a glutamic acid residue (28.Folk J.E. Chung S.I. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 358-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 29.Folk J.E. Chung S.I. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1973; 38: 109-191PubMed Google Scholar). Seven members of the TGase family have been identified in the human genome so far, of which four (TGases 1, 2, 3, and X) are expressed in the epidermis (30.Rice R.H. Mehrpouyan M. Qin Q.

TGase 1 is expressed as a 106-kDa monomeric protein, which is constitutivelyN-myristoylated and S-palmitoylated on its amino-terminal 10-kDa domain, thereby directing the enzyme to plasma membranes (34.Candi E.

J. 1990; 265: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Membrane-bound TGase 1 enzyme is essential for both the assembly of the protein envelope by cross-linking CE structural proteins located in the intimate vicinity of the cellular membrane, and the esterification of the ω-hydroxyceramides to proteins, primarily involucrin (27.Nemes Z. Marekov L.N. Fésüs L. Steinert P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8402-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Genetic defects of TGase 1 cause the often devastating disease lamellar ichthyosis (37.Russell L.J. DiGiovanna J.J. Rogers G.R. Steinert P.M. Hashem N. Compton J.G. Bale S.J. Nat.

The homozygous TGase 1 knock-out mice show defective CE assembly and die from dehydration a few hours after birth (39.Matsuki M. Yamashita F. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Yamada K. Kinoshita C. Fushiki S.

Involucrin is ubiquitously expressed in stratified squamous epithelia, suggesting it is commonly involved in CE formation (40.Eckert R.L. Yaffe M.B. Crish J.F. Murthy S. Rorke E.A. Welter J.F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 613-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol.

Mammalian involucrins evolved by tandem duplications of glutamine and glutamic acid-rich sequences spanning between the evolutionary relatively conserved amino-terminal (“head”) and carboxyl-terminal (“tail”) domains (42.Green H. Djian P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1992; 9: 977-1017PubMed Google Scholar). Recent in vivo observations indicate that the CE formation may be initiated by the deposition of a monomolecular layer of involucrin on the inner keratinocyte membrane (41.Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 43.Jarnik M. Simon M.N. Steven A.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1051-1060PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous paper (44.Nemes Z. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11013-11021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) we described an in vitromodel system for characterizing the function of TGase 1 on the surface of synthetic lipid vesicles (SLV) of composition similar to eukaryote plasma membranes. Using this model system we have demonstrated that involucrin is absorbed to membranes containing physiological levels of phosphatidylserine at Ca2+ concentrations in the range typically seen in keratinocytes. Applying our SLV experimental system for modeling the earliest stages of CE assembly, we demonstrate here that supraphysiological levels of CSO4 severely interfere with involucrin cross-linking and ω-hydroxyceramide esterification by TGase 1. Our data reveal new insights into the pathophysiology of XI disease. Full-length human TGase 1 and involucrin proteins were expressed and purified exactly as described (44.Nemes Z. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11013-11021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A K62N mutant form of human involucrin was made from the pET11a expression plasmid by use of the GCACATGACTGCTGTAACGGGACTGCCTGAGCAAGAATG primer and its reverse strand using the QuickChange (Stratagene) kit, and further processed identically to the wild type. Occasionally, involucrin expression was induced in a LB broth containing 100 nmol (0.5 mCi/liter) of l-[35S]cysteine and 100 nmol (0.5 mCi/liter) of l-[35S]methionine (both from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The following mixtures were made in chloroform/methanol (2:1): 55 mol % dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine, 15 mol % dipalmitoyl phosphatidylserine, 0–10 mol % CSO4, cholesterol up to 99 mol % (all from Sigma), and 1 mol % of the synthetic ceramide analogN-[16-(16-hydroxyhexadecyl)oxypalmitoyl]sphingosine (lipid Z) (27.Nemes Z. Marekov L.N. Fésüs L. Steinert P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8402-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The solvent was evacuated, and the lipids were taken up in aqueous buffer and dispersed by sonication as before (44.Nemes Z. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11013-11021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The prepared SLV suspension was equipped with 0.94 pmol (0.1 μg) of TGase 1 and its membrane binding was facilitated by incubating at 37 °C for 15 min prior to adding substrates. SLV (200 μl, 2 μmol of lipid) formulated with 0–10 mol % CSO4 were loaded with TGase 1 as above and 600 pmol (40 μg) of involucrin in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. They were immediately incubated for 2 h in either the absence or presence of 20 mm putrescine with 100 nCi of [14C]putrescine (NEN Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA, 110 Ci/mmol). The reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to 10 mm. In control experiments we assessed whether the applied concentrations of CSO4 disrupted or aggregated the SLV. SLV confectioned with 0–15 mol % CSO4 and the above ingredients in various combinations were diluted 10-fold in reaction buffer (without isotope) and examined by light scattering at 310 nm. As we found no changes in light scattering for CSO4concentrations below 12 mol %, we routinely used SLV containing ≤10 mol % CSO4. The above reaction mixtures were diluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (45.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), boiled, and analyzed by autoradiography after transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes following SDS-PAGE on 4–20% gradient gels (Novex). In some experiments, 0.1 ml of 20% SDS was added to the samples and the mixture was vortexed. This mixture was precipitated and washed three times with acetone/triethylamine/acetic acid (90:5:5) (46.Konigsberg W.H. Henderson L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) to remove the SDS and noncovalently bound lipids. After further washing with acetone, the pellet was dried under vacuum and redissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Quantitation of the N ε-(γ-glutamyl) lysine isopeptide cross-link was done by amino acid analysis following exhaustive proteolytic fragmentation of the products by the nonspecific protease Pronase and a mixture of carboxypeptidases (47.Tarcsa E. Fesus L. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). V max,K m, and k cat values were determined exactly as described (44.Nemes Z. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11013-11021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The tryptic peptides of involucrin reacted with TGase 1 on SLV formulated with 1% lipid Z for 2 h were recovered and quantitated exactly as described (27.Nemes Z. Marekov L.N. Fésüs L. Steinert P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8402-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). There are four different outcomes of TGase catalysis of reactive Gln residues in the present experimental system, and are as follows: deamidated (that is, a Glu residue is formed); ester-linked to the synthetic ceramide analog lipid Z; and isopeptide cross-linked, either to theN ε-amino group of an involucrin Lys residue or, where added, to the diamine substrate putrescine forming γ-glutamylputrescine (EP). Finally some substrate glutamine residues are recovered in unmodified form. The following procedures were designed to separately identify and quantitate each of these five end products. Samples of TGase 1-reacted involucrin were freed from SLV lipids as above. The protein was then digested with 2% (by weight) modified trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The grossly different chromatographic properties ofN ε-Lys62 cross-linked and lipid Z-linked tryptic involucrin peptides allowed their separation and quantitation by amino acid analysis following acid hydrolysis. In the samples reacted with lipid Z, first the digest was passed through a C4 HPLC column under strongly desorbing solvent conditions as described (27.Nemes Z. Marekov L.N. Fésüs L. Steinert P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8402-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), where only the lipopeptides are retarded and all other non-lipid-containing peptides are recovered in the column flow-through (4.Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17763-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The amount of the five lipid Z-ester linked peptides (see Fig. 5 A) was determined by amino acid analysis. The peptide pool recovered from the C4 column flow-through was further separated by C18 HPLC chromatography as described (44.Nemes Z. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11013-11021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here peptides involved in cross-link formation were recovered as distinct peaks (P1 and P2 of Fig. 2 B) when cross-linked to another involucrin peptide. Sequences and cross-linking sites of these peptides were determined by peptide sequencing as before (48.Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). To eliminate interference of overlapping (non-cross-linked) tryptic peptides of involucrin, the absolute molar amount of cross-linked residues was calculated from the Thr content, since Thr was absent from neighboring contaminating peptide peaks and was equimolar with theN-ε(γ-glutamyl)lysine isopeptide present in the cross-linked peptide (Table I).Figure 2Identification of cross-linking sites in involucrin. C18 HPLC profiles of tryptic involucrin peptides were compared before (A) and after (B) reaction with TGase 1 bound to SLV containing no CSO4. Peaks harboring the 5 Gln residues reactive with SLV-bound TGase 1 are indicated with arrows on panel A. For clarity, the same peak numbering system was retained as before (44.Nemes Z. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11013-11021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). TGase 1-dependent appearance of the novel peaks P1and P2 is noted.

After Edman degradation, the phenylthiohydantoin-derivatized residues each appeared as a distinct peak in the sequencer's HPLC profile (see Fig. 6). The ratio of deamidation and putrescine cross-linking was determined from the relative intensity of PITC/phenylthiohydantoin-derivatized Gln, Glu, and EP peaks from the sequencing cycles corresponding to each expected Gln residue as four of the reactive Gln residues were preceded by an unreactive Gln, the ratio of the unmodified and deamidated Gln/Glu residues was corrected for carryover from the previous sequencing cycle of Gln, using the formula, Q/E=[Qn−Qn−1·(1−Qn+1/Qn)][1+En−1+En−1)][En−En−1·(1−En+1/En)][1−En−1/(Qn−1+En−1)]Equation 1 where X n denotes the amount of the amino acid released from the sequencing cycle corresponding to the reactive residue position, and X n−1, orX n+1 denote the yield of the same amino acid in the previous or consecutive sequencing cycle. Similarly, the amount of EP was corrected for incomplete cleavage and carryover by the formula, EP−(EPn) 2·(EPn/(EPn−EPn+1)Equation 2 Where EPn denotes the amount of γ-glutamylputrescine in the first cycle of its appearance and EPn+1 is that from the next cycle. Molar absorption of EP was taken equal to that of Lys at the detection wavelength of the Porton 3000 sequencer (268 nm). Thus based on the directly measured absolute amounts of Gln residues occupied by theN ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine cross-link and the lipid Z ester, we could calculate from the sequencing chromatograms the fate of the remainder of the 600 pmol of the Gln residues of involucrin that was unreacted, deamidated, and in control experiments, putrescine-linked. The data represent the means of three or more independent measurements. Wild type 35S-involucrin was reacted with TGase 1 on the surface of SLV for 2 h in the absence of exogenous glutamyl acceptor substrates. The protein was cross-linked into dimers, trimers, tetramers, and higher oligomers, as evidenced by autoradiography of protein blots after separation by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 A). Some of the protein showed faster electrophoretic mobility than the monomer, indicative of intramolecular cross-link formation (49.LaCelle P.T. Lambert A. Ekambaram M.C. Robinson N.A. Eckert R.L. Skin Pharmacol. Appl. Skin Physiol. 1998; 11: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Oligomers larger than tetramers were not separated by the gels used, but remained at the interface of the separation gel. Inclusion of 1 mol % lipid Z into the SLV membranes did not eliminate involucrin cross-linking by TGase 1 (Fig. 1 B), but the addition of 20 mm putrescine as a competitive inhibitor of protein bound lysine ε-amino groups (Fig. 1 C) or omission of Ca2+ (not shown) caused a virtually complete inhibition of oligomer formation. These data indicate that involucrin is a complete substrate for the TGase 1 enzyme bound to SLV, in that it provides both donor Gln and acceptor Lys residues, and confirm a similar conclusion for the reaction of crude TGase 1 with involucrin in solution assays (49.LaCelle P.T.

Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996: 65-79Google Scholar). Its primary physiological targets, however, are thrombin and factor Xa. In its native state antithrombin exists predominantly in a conformation in which residues P15 and P14 (positions 15 and 14 residues N-terminal of the scissile bond, which is defined as the bond between the P1 and P1′ residues) of the reactive center loop are inserted into β-sheet A (state A). In this conformation the scissile P1–P1′ bond is constrained into a conformation that is very poorly reactive with both factor Xa and thrombin (2.Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second conformation exists (state B), in which residues P15 and P14 have been expelled from β-sheet A, with consequent alteration in the conformation and/or flexibility of the P1–P1′ bond (3.Gettins P.G.W.

To permit regulation of the location and rate of inhibition of factor Xa, it appears that antithrombin has evolved to require heparin as a high affinity allosteric activator that can shift the position of the equilibrium between ∼100% A in the absence of heparin to ∼100% B state upon heparin binding. A specific pentasaccharide sequence in heparin is required for the high affinity binding. Other sulfated polysaccharides, such as low affinity heparin or dermatan sulfate, give intermediate degrees of activation (3.Gettins P.G.W. Fan B. Crews B.C. Turko I.V. Olson S.T. Streusand V.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8385-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4.Streusand V.J. Björk I. Gettins P.G.W. Petitou M. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9043-9051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which can be interpreted either as resulting from intermediate positions of the equilibrium between A and B states or conversion of the A state of antithrombin into alternative conformations with different rates of reaction with factor Xa. Although much work has previously been carried out to identify the high affinity binding site for heparin pentasaccharide, using chemical modification, site-directed mutagenesis, and study of natural antithrombin variants, it was the solution of the crystal structure of the pentasaccharide-bound form of antithrombin (5.Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) that first clearly defined the site. This structure, together with that of native antithrombin (6.Skinner R. Abrahams J.-P. Whisstock J.C. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), established the conformational changes that occur within this region as a result of heparin binding. These structures show that the highly negatively charged pentasaccharide interacts specifically with basic residues on helix D (Lys125 and Arg129), helix A (Arg46 and Arg47), and the N terminus (Lys11 and Arg13). Binding furthermore induces extension of helix D at its C-terminal end and results in formation of a new one-turn helix, helix P, which interacts with heparin through residues Lys114 and Glu113. These structures also confirmed conclusions from biochemical studies (7.Huntington J.A. Olson S.T. Fan B. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8495-8503Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 8.Huntington J.A. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) that indicated that heparin binding resulted in expulsion of the P14 and P15 residues from β-sheet A (Fig.1). Despite the great advance in understanding of the mechanism of heparin activation of antithrombin that resulted from elucidation of these crystal structures, a major question remained unanswered. That is, how do the conformational changes that occur in the heparin-binding site upon binding heparin pentasaccharide result in transmission of a signal to β-sheet A that brings about expulsion of residues P15 and P14 of the reactive center loop and hence activation toward reaction with factor Xa? On the basis of the structure of native antithrombin alone (9.Schreuder H.A. de Boer B. Dijkema R. Mulders J. Theunissen H.J.M. Grootenhuis P.D.J. Hol W.G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), it had been proposed in 1994 that the heparin pentasaccharide-binding site included Arg132 and Lys133 and that heparin binding induces a previously unstructured region of six residues, including Arg132 and Lys133, to adopt a helical conformation and thereby extend helix D. This elongation was predicted to influence the position of the outer strands of β-sheet A (strands 2 and 3) and thereby result in a displacement of P14 and P15 from the β-sheet (10.van Boeckel C.A.A. Grootenhuis P.D.J. Visser A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Both mutagenesis studies (11.Meagher J.L. Huntington J.A. Fan B. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29353-29358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and the more recent crystal stucture of the pentasaccharide-antithrombin complex (5.Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) showed that neither Arg132 nor Lys133 was part of the pentasaccharide-binding site. Nevertheless both of these residues were shown to be part of the extension to the helix D that is induced by heparin binding further down the helix, as originally predicted. We therefore sought to test the idea that the coupling mechanism between heparin-induced changes in the heparin-binding site and displacement of the reactive center loop from β-sheet A involves a direct effect on strand 2A. We constructed a series of deletion variants of antithrombin (Fig. 2), in which the linker region between the end of helix D and the start of strand 2A, residues 134–137, was shortened up to an amount equivalent to that expected from conversion of six residues from extended conformation to α-helix, i.e. to mimic the extension of helix D that heparin binding induces. Our hypothesis was that if the mechanism were correct, such a shortening of the linker would result in an activated antithrombin even in the absence of heparin. Such a shorter D helix is typically found in other inhibitory serpins and is consistent with this hypothesis (12.Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). We describe here the characterization of these variants. Whereas their properties were not as expected from the simple mechanical model of heparin activation we had proposed, they did strongly implicate residues in this region as playing a critical role in the coupling of the conformational changes in the heparin-binding site and the reactive center loop. The antithrombin variants were created by site-directed mutagenesis of human antithrombin cDNA on an N135Q background using the Stratagene Quik Change Kit, following the manufacturer's directions. The Δ134-Δ137 variants were created sequentially, using the following oligonucleotides (only the sense strand is shown), 5′-CTT GGA GGA TTT CTG ↓ TTT TCG ATA GAG TCG-3′ (Δ134), 5′-TAA CTT GGA GGA TTT ↓ TTT TCG ATA GAG TCG-3′ (Δ134–135), 5′-TAC TAA GTT GGA GGA ↓ TTT TCG ATA GAG TCG-3′ (Δ134–136), and 5′-TGA TAC TAA CTT GGA ↓ TTT TCG ATA GAG TCG-3′ (Δ134–137). The Δ137 variant was created using the oligonucleotide 5′-TGA TACTAA CCT GGA ↓ TTT CTG GGC TTT TCG-3′. The down arrow indicates the location of the deleted amino acid. Baby hamster kidney cells were stably transfected with pRMH140, pSV2dhfr, and the expression plasmid. Transfected cells were selected by resistance to neomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and methotrexate (Sigma) as described previously (13.Zettlmeiβl G. Wirth M. Hauser H. Küpper H.A. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1988; 82: 26-34Google Scholar). Antithrombin was isolated from the serum-free growth medium of stably transfected cells grown to confluence in roller bottles. Antithrombin was purified by affinity chromatography on a heparin-Sepharose column followed by anion exchange chromatography on a high pressure liquid chromatography Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The antithrombin was then concentrated, and buffer was exchanged using an Amicon concentrator with a PM10 membrane. Antithrombin was stored in 100 mmNaCl, 20 mm NaPi, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% PEG 8000, pH 7.4, at −80 °C until needed. For all experiments, control antithrombin refers to N135Q antithrombin, because all variants lack a carbohydrate at this position. Antithrombin concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using the same extinction coefficient for all variants as for control antithrombin, E2801%nm = 6.5 (14.Nordenman B. Nyström C. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The level of antithrombin present during the production and purification procedures was monitored by radial immunodiffusion assay, using immunodiffusion plates containing sheep anti-human antithrombin antibody (The Binding Site Ltd). The purity of the variant antithrombins and the ability to form a covalent complex with proteinase was determined by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Prior to electrophoresis, the antithrombin and proteinase were incubated on ice in the presence of heparin as a catalyst. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to inactivate any unreacted proteinase, and the samples were incubated on ice. Sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled for 5 min. Protein bands were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Covalent complex is evident from the appearance of a characteristic band at higher molecular weight than antithrombin or proteinase. The active concentration of functional antithrombin was determined by stoichiometric titration of 1 μm antithrombin and 20 μm TNS1 with full-length high affinity heparin previously standardized against fully active plasma antithrombin, using the well defined inflection point of the fluorescence at saturation with heparin (15.Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Measurements were made on an SLM 8000 spectrofluorimeter, exciting TNS at a wavelength of 330 nm and recording TNS emission at 432 nm. Bandwidths of 4 nm for excitation and 4 nm for emission were used. Data were fitted to a single-site binding model equation by nonlinear least square analysis using the SCIENTIST program (Micromath Scientific Software, Salt Lake City, UT). The Δ134–135 variant was found to be 81% active, and the Δ134–137 variant was found to be 42% active. All other variants were 100% active within experimental error. All calculations of stoichiometry of inhibition, fluorescence enhancement, and rates of proteinase inhibition were corrected for any inactive antithrombin. Because of the decreased fluorescence enhancement upon heparin binding seen for the antithrombin deletion variants, tryptophan fluorescence, which is normally exploited to determine heparin affinity (15.Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), could not be used to obtain accurate heparin affinities. Instead, the fluorescence of TNS (Molecular Probes), a probe that is sensitive to environment and binds weakly to antithrombin (K d> 125 μm), 2S. Olson, unpublished observations. was used. Heparin binding to antithrombin-TNS causes a change in the environment of the antithrombin-bound TNS, resulting in an approximately 50–60% decrease in TNS fluorescence intensity and a blue shift of the emission maximum. To determine the antithrombin-heparin dissociation constants for the variants, antithrombin in the presence of a 20-fold excess of TNS was titrated with heparin. For control antithrombin and the Δ137 variant, 250 nm antithrombin and 5 μm TNS were used for both pentasaccharide and full-length heparin titrations. For the rest of the deletion variants, 250 or 300 nm antithrombin and 5 or 6 μm TNS were used for full-length heparin titrations, and 250–500 nm antithrombin and 5–10 μm TNS were used for pentasaccharide titrations. All titrations were carried out in I 0.15 buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, and 0.1 m NaCl at 25 °C and pH 7.4. Fluorescence measurements were recorded on an SLM 8000 spectrofluorimeter, exciting the TNS at 330 nm and recording TNS emission at 432 nm. Bandwidths of 4 nm for excitation and 8–16 nm for emission (depending on antithrombin concentration) were used. Data were fitted to a single-site binding model equation by nonlinear least square analysis using the SCIENTIST program (Micromath Scientific Software). The stoichiometry of inhibition (SI), defined as the number of moles of inhibitor needed to inhibit 1 mol of proteinase, was measured by incubating antithrombin over a range of concentrations with a constant concentration of proteinase. Reactions were allowed to go to completion, and residual proteinase activity was measured by diluting the reaction mixture into chromogenic substrate and measuring the rate of substrate hydrolysis, as described previously (16.Gettins P.G.W. Choay J. Crews B.C. Zettlmeiβl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21946-21953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of inhibition was determined by plotting the residual proteinase activity against the ratio of antithrombin to proteinase. For factor Xa, the chromogenic substrate used was 100 μm Spectrozyme Xa (American Diagnostica) and for thrombin 100 μm S2238 (Chromogenix). For factor Xa the stoichiometry of inhibition was measured using 50 nmfactor Xa and 10–60 nm antithrombin. For determinations in the presence of heparin, 120 nm full-length heparin was added. For thrombin, the stoichiometry of inhibition was measured using 50 nm thrombin and 10–200 nm antithrombin and, in the presence of heparin, 150 nm HAH. All reactions were carried out in buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, and 0.1m NaCl (I 0.15) at 25 °C and pH 7.4, in PEG 20,000-coated cuvettes. The rate of inhibition of factor Xa by the antithrombin variants was measured under pseudo-first order conditions of 250 nm antithrombin and 20 nm factor Xa, as described previously (15.Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). For the heparin catalyzed reaction, the second order rate constantk cat/K m was determined using the above conditions in the presence of catalytic concentrations of full-length heparin (0–4 nm) or pentasaccharide heparin (0–40 nm) by Equation 1 (2.Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). kobs=kcat·[H] oKm·[AT] oKd+[AT] o+kuncat·[AT] oEquation 1 where [H]0 is the total heparin concentration, [AT]0 is the total antithrombin concentration,K d is the measured antithrombin-heparin dissociation constant, and k uncat is the second order rate constant for inhibition of proteinase in the absence of heparin. The chromogenic substrate used to measure residual factor Xa activity was Spectrozyme Xa (American Diagnostica). Rates of inhibition of thrombin were determined similarly, using 250 nm antithrombin and 10 nm thrombin and, for the heparin catalyzed reaction, 0–1 nm full-length heparin. Residual thrombin activity was measured by the rate of hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate, S2238 (Chromogenix). All kinetic reactions were carried out in PEG 20,000-coated cuvettes at 25 °C in pH 7.4 buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, and 0.1 m NaCl (I0.15). Tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on an SLM 8000 spectrofluorimeter, exciting at 280 nm and recording emission in 1 nm steps from 300–400 nm. An excitation bandwidth of 4 nm and an emission bandwidth of 2 nm were used. The concentration of antithrombin was 500 nm. In the presence of heparin, 1.5 μmfull-length heparin was added. For the weakest binding variant, Δ134–137, this gave 93% saturation. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. Human factor Xa was prepared as described previously (17.Bock P.E. Craig P.A. Olson S.T. Singh P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). α-Thrombin was prepared from prothrombin isolated from outdated human plasma by the method of Miletich et al. (18.Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. Majerus P.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), by reaction with snake venom as described (19.Lanchantin G.F. Friedmann J.A. Hart D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 5956-5966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length high affinity heparin (M r 15,000) was prepared by fractionation of heparin, first by size-exclusion chromatography and then by antithrombin affinity chromatography as described (2.Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic high affinity heparin pentasaccharide was a gift from the late Dr. Jean Choay (Center Choay). The plasmids pMAStop, pRMH140, and pSV2dhfr (13.Zettlmeiβl G. Wirth M. Hauser H. Küpper H.A. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1988; 82: 26-34Google Scholar) were gifts from Dr. Gerd Zettlemeißl (Behringwerke, Marburg). The five antithrombin deletion variants (Fig. 2) were determined to be homogenous after purification by analysis on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). In the absence of proteinase, all variants migrated as a single band with the same mobility as control antithrombin. Because the mutations represented deletions of one or more residues rather than simple amino acid replacements, it was necessary to show that the changes had not altered the basic properties of the antithrombin molecule. As a serpin, antithrombin inhibits proteinases by forming SDS-stable 1:1 covalent complexes. Because functioning of the serpin mechanism is very sensitive to the conformation of the inhibitor, the ability to inhibit proteinases is a good diagnostic for retention of the basic serpin fold. All of the antithrombin deletion variants were able to form the characteristic higher molecular weight SDS-stable covalent complex with thrombin (not shown). This demonstrated that the deletions in the region linking helix D and strand 2A had not affected the ability to inhibit proteinase by the serpin inhibitory mechanism and implied that the antithrombin variants were correctly folded. SI values were determined for the variant antithrombins for reaction with both factor Xa and thrombin. Both in the absence and presence of heparin the deletions caused only modest increase in the SI, with the largest value in the absence of heparin, 1.8–1.9, being found for the Δ134 variant with factor Xa and thrombin (Table I). Compared with control antithrombin, heparin caused similar small increases in SI for the variants. Because the deletions are less likely to have affected the substrate reaction rate constant, it is probable that the small increases in SI for the variants represent small reductions in the rate constant for commitment to the inhibition pathway. This rate constant is influenced by the relative ease of insertion of the reactive center loop into β-sheet A at the stage of the acyl enzyme intermediate (20.Hood D.B. Huntington J.A. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8538-8547Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 21.Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol.

Thus, the small increases in SI for several of the variants may reflect small perturbations of the sheet opening mechanism.Table IStoichiometries of inhibition of factor Xa and thrombin by control and deletion variant antithrombinAntithrombinFactor XaThrombin−Heparin+HAH−Heparin+HAHControl1.2 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.1Δ1341.9 ± 0.72.7 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.12.7 ± 0.5Δ134–1351.1 ± 0.31.6 ± 0.041.0 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.1Δ134–1361.9 ± 0.42.4 ± 0.41.6 ± 0.12.3 ± 0.1Δ134–1371.5 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.12.0 ± 0.2Δ1371.6 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.31.2 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Human antithrombin contains four tryptophans, at positions 49, 189, 225 and 307. Only tryptophan 49 is directly in the heparin-binding site. Nevertheless, heparin binding results in an ∼40% fluorescence enhancement as a result of the heparin-induced conformational changes. We have previously shown that most of the enhancement results from changes in the environment of tryptophans 225 and 307 (24.Meagher J.L. Beechem J.M. Olson S.T. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23283-23289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and is directly linked to expulsion of the P14 residue from β-sheet A and the resulting structural changes arising from sheet contraction (tryptophan 225 is adjacent to P14 in the native state and tryptophan 307 lies directly below this position on an axis perpendicular to β-sheet A). Changes in the conformation of antithrombin between loop-inserted and loop-expelled conformations are therefore sensitively reported by changes in tryptophan fluorescence. All variants gave essentially normal emission spectra in the absence of heparin in both intensity and shape when compared with that of control antithrombin (not shown), indicating both that the environments of the tryptophans had not been perturbed by the mutations and also that the ground state conformational equilibrium between loop-inserted and loop-expelled states still very strongly favored the loop-inserted state in each case. The method is not, however, sensitive enough to identify very small percentage changes in the loop-expelled conformation. The five variants fell into two groups with respect to heparin-induced tryptophan fluorescence changes. The Δ137 variant gave an essentially normal enhancement of 35% (Table II). The remaining variants, in which deletions were present near the D helix, showed strongly altered tryptophan fluorescence enhancements, with increases of only 6–15% upon saturation with heparin (K d values were determined below). This could be interpreted in one of two ways. If the mutations are affecting the position of equilibrium between A and B states, this would suggest that the percentage of B state induced by heparin ranges between 15% for the Δ134–136 variant and a high of ∼37% for the Δ134–135 variant, compared with ∼100% normally. Alternatively heparin may in each case induce a new and different conformation in which tryptophans 225 and 307 are perturbed differently. In either case it would suggest that the deletions from the N-terminal end had affected the coupling between the conformational changes induced in the heparin-binding site and the resulting conformational changes in the reactive center loop that are reported by tryptophans 225 and 307.Table IIHAH-induced fluorescence enhancement of control and deletion variants of antithrombinAntithrombinFluorescence enhancementaMeasured at 340 nm.

Open table in a new tab Heparin affinity is normally determined by titration of antithrombin with heparin and monitoring changes in tryptophan fluorescence. However, the reduced fluorescence enhancement upon heparin binding for the deletion variants restricted the use of tryptophan fluorescence to monitor the heparin affinity. Instead, TNS, a hydrophobic probe that binds to antithrombin and is sensitive to heparin binding, was employed. The binding of heparin to antithrombin-TNS to the point of saturation of the heparin-binding site resulted in approximately a 60% decrease in TNS fluorescence intensity and a blue shift of about 3 nm (Fig. 3). The saturability of the TNS fluorescence change with heparin and the altered intensity and wavelength maximum indicate that heparin is not competing with TNS for binding at the same site on antithrombin but rather that TNS is a reporter of the conformation of antithrombin. A control titration of heparin binding to plasma antithrombin showed that the heparin dissociation constants determined in this way agreed with those determined using change in tryptophan fluorescence and so showed that the results were not affected by the presence of TNS (data not shown). Titration of antithrombin-TNS with heparin was therefore used to determine the heparin affinity for all the variants as well as control antithrombin. Although all of the deletion variants showed reduced affinity for both full-length and pentasaccharide heparin (Fig.4 and TableIII), the reductions represented loss of no more than about 18% of the binding energy (2 kcal mol−1 out of 12 kcal mol−1). For pentasaccharide heparin, deletions near the D helix (Δ134-) showed a 10–40-fold reduction in heparin affinity, whereas the deletion further from the D helix (Δ137) showed a smaller reduction (6-fold). For full-length heparin, deletions near the D helix showed a 12–39-fold reduction in affinity, whereas the deletion further away showed only a 5-fold reduction in affinity. To emphasize that these reductions in heparin affinity are relatively modest given the nature of the structural changes, it should be noted that the reactive center loop-cleaved form of antithrombin has lost about 35% of the heparin binding energy relative to native antithrombin, even though residues in the heparin-binding region differ only conformationally from those in the native state.Figure 4Heparin titrations of antithrombin-TNS to determine heparin affinity. The Kd values for full-length and pentasaccharide heparin were determined by heparin titration of antithrombin bound to TNS, a fluorescent probe.

Heichal O. Blumenfeld A. Cassel D. Suss E. Barash S. Rubinstein C.T. Minke B. Selinger Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6939-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 4.Selinger Z.

The strongest argument for PLCβ playing a central role in the activation process of the phototransduction cascade comes from the isolation of the norpA gene and the identification of its gene product as a PLCβ (5.Bloomquist B.T.

Because strong alleles of norpA result in the loss of any photoresponse (7.Pak W.L. Grossfield J. Arnold K.S. Nature. 1970; 227: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar,8.Hotta Y. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), the presence of a functional, norpA-encoded PLCβ seems to be mandatory for photoreception. We and others have recently shown that PLCβ is assembled by the PDZ domain protein INAD into a signaling complex together with two other key proteins of phototransduction, the eye-specific protein kinase C and the major light-activated Ca2+ channel TRP (9.Huber A.

This INAD signaling complex has been postulated to provide the core of a supramolecular transducisome that serves as the molecular entity for the generation of unitary visual responses (12.Tsunoda S.

Nature. 1998; 395: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition to the core components of the signaling complex that are present in the complex at a 1:1 stoichiometry (10.Huber A. Sander P. Gobert A. Baehner M. Hermann R. Paulsen R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7036-7045Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), other phototransduction proteins, namely, rhodopsin, calmodulin, a second ion channel (transient receptor potential-like (TRPL)), and the unconventional myosin NINAC, were shown to interact with INAD (13.Chevesich J. Kreuz A.J. Montell C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 14.Xu X.Z. Choudhury A. Li X. Montell C. J.

Nature Neurosci. 1999; 2: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, an interaction of the visual G protein with the INAD-assembled signaling complex has not yet been demonstrated. Given the crucial role of the G protein for this transduction pathway, we have now addressed this question, and we show that Gαq binds to the complex upon activation only. Our data suggest that Gαq functions as a shuttle that reports the light activation of rhodopsin to the INAD signaling complex more or less like a mobile switch that turns on a defined number of the light-activated ion channels that are clustered in the complex. Male Calliphora vicina Meig., chalky mutant, were raised at 25 °C in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and used for the experiments at an age of 8–10 days post eclosion. The Drosophila fly strains were raised on a standard corn meal diet under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and used for the experiments within 48 h post eclosion. Drosophila norpA P24 mutant was provided by W. L. Pak (7.Pak W.L. Grossfield J. Arnold K.S. Nature. 1970; 227: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies directed againstCalliphora Gβe and Gγe andDrosophila TRP were generated by immunizing rabbits with recombinantly expressed polypeptides as described previously (9.Huber A.

The peptides used to generate anti-Gγe and anti-CvGβe antibodies comprised the entire coding region of CvGγe or amino acids 65–346 of CvGβe. 2Schulz, S., Huber, A., Schwab, K., and Paulsen, R. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 37605–37610. The anti-DmTRP antibody is directed against the C-terminal region (amino acids 906–1275). The antibodies were affinity-purified using the respective antigen. The anti-DmGαq antibody was kindly provided by C. Zuker (20.Scott K. Becker A. Sun Y. Hardy R. Zuker C. Neuron. 1995; 15: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar); the anti-CvINAD(272–542) antibody has been described previously (9.Huber A. Sander P. Paulsen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11710-11717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Rhabdomeral photoreceptor membranes of dark-adapted Calliphora were isolated as described previously (21.Paulsen R. J. Comp. Physiol. 1984; 155: 47-55Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For isolation of Drosophila head membranes, 250 heads were homogenized in 100 μl of Buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.42 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.83 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.83 μg/ml aprotinin). The homogenate was centrifugated at 3,000 × g to remove chitinous material. Membranes were isolated by centrifugation at 400,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. Activation of Gαq was performed either by using AlF4− (22.Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4888-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) or by illuminating photoreceptor membranes in the presence of GTPγS. For the activation by AlF4−, 0.1 volume of an AlF4− stock solution, which was prepared by mixing 100 mm NaF with 500 μmAlCl3 and incubating the mixture for 30 min at 20 °C to generate stable AlF4− complexes, was added to rhabdomeral photoreceptor membranes from 15Calliphora retinas in HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 115 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.42 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.83 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.83 μg/ml aprotinin) or to membranes of 250Drosophila heads in HBS-plus buffer (HBS buffer with 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm GDP). The sample was incubated in the dark for 5 min on ice (P-membranes). For light activation of the G protein, photoreceptor membranes of Calliphora 20 retinas were resuspended in HBS buffer containing 100 μm GTPγS. The samples were either illuminated with blue light (Schott BG12; light source, Schott KL1500) for 5 min on ice (M-membranes) or kept in the dark (P-membranes). Proteins were extracted by adding 1 volume of a double concentrated Triton X-100 buffer (2% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.42 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.83 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.83 μg/ml aprotinin) containing either AlF4−( AlF4−-activated samples) or GTPγS (light-activated samples), and insoluble material was sedimented by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation of the INAD signaling complex from extracts of Calliphora retinal membranes orDrosophila head membranes was performed with the anti-CvINAD(272–542) or the anti-DmTRP antibody, respectively, as described previously (9.Huber A. Sander P. Paulsen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11710-11717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10.Huber A. Sander P. Gobert A. Baehner M. Hermann R. Paulsen R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7036-7045Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The Triton X-100 washing buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) used for washing immunoprecipitates of AlF4− or light-activated samples also contained AlF4− or GTPγS, respectively. Precipitated proteins were eluted from protein A-agarose beads (Bio-Rad) with 15 μl of 1× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (23.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and Western blot analysis. In the current models of invertebrate phototransduction (e.g. Ref. 24.Zuker C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), it is proposed that the α subunit of the visual G protein activates phospholipase Cβ, which is a member of the INAD signaling complex. To test this hypothesis, we activated the visual G protein of Calliphora or Drosophilaphotoreceptor membranes either by illuminating the membranes in the presence of GTPγS with blue light, which photoconverts 70% rhodopsin (P) to metarhodopsin (M) (Ref. 21.Paulsen R. J. Comp. Physiol. 1984; 155: 47-55Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar; Fig.1), or by adding AlF4−, which activates G proteins independently of receptor activation (Ref. 22.Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4888-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar; Fig.2). We then extracted the membrane proteins and investigated whether or not the α or βγ subunit co-immunoprecipitates with the INAD signaling complex. Analysis of the immunoprecipitates revealed that activated Gαq binds to the signaling complex, regardless of whether activation was mediated by light activation of the receptor rhodopsin or independently of it (Figs. 1 and 2). Gαq is not associated with the signaling complex in its inactive state, i.e. when the isolated membranes were neither illuminated nor treated with AlF4−. Gβe and Gγe are not detected in the immunoprecipitates, indicating that the Gβγ complex does not undergo high-affinity interactions with members of the signaling complex (Fig. 2), although it has been reported that Gβ affects deactivation of the cascade downstream of the receptor (25.Dolph P.J. Man S.H. Yarfitz S. Colley N.J. Deer J.R. Spencer M. Hurley J.B. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1994; 370: 59-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These results provide the first evidence for a direct, light-dependent interaction of Gαq with a component of the INAD signaling complex. To demonstrate that the target of Gαq is indeed PLCβ and none of the other members of the signaling complex, we investigated the binding of AlF4−-activated Gαq to the INAD signaling complex in a Drosophila norpA mutant that lacks PLCβ (Fig.3). The same amount of Gαqis present in photoreceptor membranes of wild type flies and of thenorpA mutant (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2), but PLCβ is absent in signaling complexes immunoprecipitated fromnorpA flies (Fig. 3, lane 5). Activated Gαq fails to bind to the INAD signaling complex of thenorpA mutant (Fig. 3, lane 5), indicating that the binding partner of activated Gαq is PLCβ and not another component of the signaling complex.Figure 2AlF 4−-activated Gαq, but not the βγ subunit, binds to the INAD signaling complex. Receptor-independent activation of the G protein was performed by treating rhabdomeral photoreceptor membranes ofCalliphora with AlF4−as described under “Experimental Procedures.” AlF4−-treated samples and controls were processed as described in the Fig. 1 legend. Extracted proteins (lanes 1 and 2), immunoprecipitates obtained by precipitation with anti-CvINAD(272–542) (lanes 3 and 4), and controls for the specificity of the immunoprecipitation (lanes 5 and 6) were probed for the presence of Gαq, Gβe, and Gγe by Western blot analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Phospholipase Cβ is the target of Gαq binding.Membranes of Drosophila heads from wild type (wt) flies and norpA mutant were treated with AlF4− as indicated.

Extracted proteins from wild type and norpA mutant (lanes 1and 2, respectively) and immunoprecipitates (lanes 3–5) were analyzed as described in the Fig. 1 legend. Top panel, silver-stained protein gel; bottom panel, Western blot probed with anti-Gαq.

Dobbs M.B. Verardi M.L. Hyde D.R. Neuron. 1990; 5: 889-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar,27.Lee Y.J. Shah S. Suzuki E. Zars T. O'Day P.M. Hyde D.R. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Studies using transgenic flies that express different levels of Gαq suggest that it functions as a molecular on-off switch reporting upstream activity induced by photon absorbance of rhodopsin (20.Scott K. Becker A. Sun Y. Hardy R. Zuker C. Neuron. 1995; 15: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Gαq may exert this on-off switch function by interaction with PLCβ molecules tethered to the signaling complex. In the present study, we demonstrate that photoconversion of rhodopsin (P) into the active metarhodopsin state (M) results in the binding of the activated Gαq-GTP state to the signaling complex. If GTP hydrolysis on Gαq is prevented by using the non-hydrolyzable analog GTPγS, Gαq assumes a conformation that undergoes a long-lasting, high-affinity interaction with the INAD signaling complex. We provide evidence that PLCβ assembled into the INAD signaling complex is in fact the target of Gαq. This is demonstrated by our results showing that signaling complexes of a Drosophila mutant that lacksnorpA-encoded PLCβ do not bind light-activated Gαq. Our studies on the AlF4−-activated Gαq state, which mimics a pentavalent intermediate for GTP hydrolysis (28.Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), reveal that this high-affinity interaction with INAD-linked PLCβ still persists after transformation of Gαq to the transition state conformation just before GTP hydrolysis occurs. Thus, each activated Gαq molecule interacts with its target enzyme PLCβ only once before it becomes inactivated by GTP hydrolysis. Our conclusion is in line with reports demonstrating that PLCβ has the ability to inactivate the G protein by increasing the intrinsic GTPase activity by >100-fold (29.Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 30.Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It is also in line with the proposed function of DrosophilaGαq as a molecular switch that does not contribute to signal amplification (20.Scott K. Becker A. Sun Y. Hardy R. Zuker C. Neuron. 1995; 15: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The current evidence for the macromolecular organization of theDrosophila phototransduction pathway suggests that the majority of the proteins are restricted in their free interaction. Rhodopsin, which is the major protein present in the membrane, appears to form an almost paracrystalline structure (31.Goldsmith T.H. Wehner R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 453-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 32.el-Gammal S. Hamdorf K. Henning U. Cell Tissue Res. 1987; 248: 511-518Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), whereas other signaling proteins are preassembled into supramolecular complexes. In the scheme depicted in Fig. 4, it is indicated that the α subunit of the activated visual G protein acts as a shuttle between activated rhodopsin and the INAD signaling complex. Although it has been reported that rhodopsin may interact directly with the signaling complex (13.Chevesich J. Kreuz A.J. Montell C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 14.Xu X.Z. Choudhury A. Li X. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), we do not consider it likely that the majority of rhodopsin molecules are permanently associated with the signaling complex. We have previously found that the membrane harbors at least 40 times as many rhodopsin molecules as signaling core complexes (10.Huber A. Sander P. Gobert A. Baehner M. Hermann R. Paulsen R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7036-7045Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, the visual signal has to be transmitted from light-activated rhodopsin to the ion channels of the signaling complex. The G protein and the second messenger molecules generated in the course of phototransduction appear to be the prime candidates for components capable of transporting the visual signal across spatial distances. This is underscored by our current finding showing that Gαq binds to the signaling complex with high affinity only in an activated form. In contrast to the proposal that virtually the entire phototransduction apparatus is organized in a “signaling web” through multiple interactions with INAD (33.Montell C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the model presented here addresses the function of a shuttle reporting the light-activated signal from one of hundreds of rhodopsin molecules to the signaling complex. In this scenario, an excess number of light receptors that are densely packed in the photoreceptor membrane would provide the lattice for a high light absorption probability. After interaction with the active metarhodopsin form and GDP-GTP nucleotide exchange, Gαq-GTP released from Gβγ would transfer the activation signal to PLCβ tethered to the INAD signaling complex. It follows from the spatial organization provided by the INAD signaling complex that activated PLCβ linked to the INAD complex will liberate the messengers diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate from phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate in the vicinity of the complex. This PLCβ activity may generate an activated membrane patch with a spatially restricted increase in intracellular transmitter concentration that finally results in the coordinated gating of TRP channels sequestered to this microdomain. A highly localized formation of intracellular transmitters that activate phototransduction might explain the inability to unequivocally demonstrate light-independent activation of the cascade by exogenous application of putative transmitters, whereas activation of the visual G protein by AlF4− excites the photoreceptors in the dark (34.Minke B. Stephenson R.S. J. Comp. Physiol. 1985; 156: 339-356Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 35.Minke B. Selinger Z. Prog. Retinal Res. 1991; 11: 99-124Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We thank C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1857-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), from the structure of the PI-SceI apoenzyme (9.Duan X. Gimble F.S. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and from the structure of a related endonuclease, I-CreI, complexed to its DNA substrate (10.Jurica M.S. Monnat Jr., R.J. Stoddard B.L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 469-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) provide clues to general features of the interaction. The PI-SceI structure is composed of two domains that contain the protein splicing (domain I) and endonucleolytic active sites (domain II), respectively (9.Duan X. Gimble F.S. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The two LAGLIDADG motifs constitute two tightly packed α-helices that are each contributed by one of two subdomains related by pseudo-2-fold symmetry and form the hydrophobic core of the endonuclease domain. Two conserved acidic residues (Asp-218 and Asp-326) at the carboxyl termini of these helices may function to coordinate the Mg2+ co-factor(s) that is involved in the DNA cleavage mechanism (11.Gimble F.S. Stephens B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5849-5856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The group I intron-encoded I-CreI endonuclease is structurally similar to the PI-SceI endonuclease domain (12.Aggarwal A.K. Wah D.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13.Gimble F.S. Hu D. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30524-30529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, I-CreI differs from PI-SceI in two significant respects; it lacks a protein splicing domain, and it is a homodimeric protein composed of two molecules that are related by 2-fold symmetry (14.Heath P.J. Stephens K.M. Monnat Jr., R.J. Stoddard B.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), each of which is topologically similar to the N or C subdomains of the PI-SceI endonuclease domain. Within the I-CreI-DNA complex, the DNA rests in a saddle formed by β sheets contributed by both monomers and contacts the protein over an extended surface area (10.Jurica M.S. Monnat Jr., R.J. Stoddard B.L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 469-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We proposed a hypothetical model for the PI-SceI-DNA complex in which the endonuclease domain contacts the PI-SceI cleavage site region of the DNA, and an extended subdomain of the protein splicing domain termed the DNA recognition region (DRR) binds to a distal section of the target sequence (9.Duan X. Gimble F.S. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). When the I-CreI-DNA complex structure was determined, we modified the model by docking the I-CreI DNA to PI-SceI (15.Hu D. Crist M. Duan X. Gimble F.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12621-12628Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This and a related model (16.Pingoud V. Thole H. Christ F. Grindl W. Wende W. Pingoud A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10235-10243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) are consistent with mutational studies of the protein and DNA substrate (6.Gimble F.S. Wang J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17.He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4607-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and with interference and footprinting analyses (6.Gimble F.S. Wang J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 11.Gimble F.S. Stephens B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5849-5856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, they are consistent with cross-linking and affinity cleavage mapping studies that position His-333 of the endonuclease domain near T+9 on the bottom strand (16.Pingoud V. Thole H. Christ F. Grindl W. Wende W. Pingoud A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10235-10243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and position residues 271–279 of a disordered loop near A/T−9 (15.Hu D. Crist M. Duan X. Gimble F.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12621-12628Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, detailed mapping information is not available for any other part of the PI-SceI-DNA interaction. Here, we have tethered the affinity cleavage reagent FeBABE and the photocross-linking reagent phenyl azide to residues in both PI-SceI domains that are expected to be near the protein-DNA contact surface and have employed these derivatized proteins to map these positions to specific regions of the PI-SceI target sequence. The data have been interpreted using a model of the PI-SecI complex based on a new PI-SecI crystal structure. Oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis were synthesized by Sigma. Restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc. TALON metal affinity resin was purchased from CLONTECH, SP-Sepharose was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and Affi-Gel Blue Gel was obtained from Bio-Rad. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C, microselect grade) was purchased from Fluka, and hydrogen peroxide (ultrex grade) was obtained from J. T. Baker. 7-(Diethylamino)-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). 4-azidophenacyl bromide and piperidine were obtained from Sigma. FeBABE was kindly provided by Dr. Claude Meares. The procedures for overexpression and purification of selenomethionyl PI-SceI have been described previously (9.Duan X. Gimble F.S. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The C2 space group crystal was grown during attempts to produce crystals of the PI-SceI-DNA complex. Selenomethionyl PI-SceI protein was mixed in a 1:1.5 molar ratio with an 18-base pair duplex containing the PI-SceI minimal recognition site (6.Gimble F.S. Wang J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and incubated 30 min prior to setting up the crystallization. An equal volume of the complex was mixed with mother liquor containing 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), 100 mm KCl, and 200 mm MgCl2, and the crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The crystals belong to space group C2 and have unit cell parameters a = 93.6 Å, b = 76.0 Å,c = 71.4 Å, and β = 111.3°. There is one molecule per asymmetric unit. The crystal was stored overnight in mother liquor containing 30% polyethylene glycol 3350 and frozen by flash-cooling. Data were collected from one frozen crystal at the HHMI X4A beam line of the National Synchrotron Light Source at wavelength 0.9791 Å with a 1° oscillation angle using a Raxis-4 system from a distance of 250 mm. The data were indexed and integrated using DENZO and scaled using SCALEPACK (18.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38436) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement was effected using Amore from the CCP4 package (19.Collaborative Computing ProjectActa Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 4: 760-763Google Scholar). The 2.4-Å PI-SceI structure of theP21 space group crystal was used without water molecules as the search model using the data from 15 to 4 Å. The search box was 80 × 80 × 80 Å with a Patterson radius of 25 Å. One outstanding peak (Eulerian angles: ϕ1 = 95.81°, ϕ2 = 65.59°, ϕ3 = 340.87°) that was found in a cross-rotation search remained as the best peak after a translation function search with fractional coordinatesx = 0.3246 and z = 0.3570 and an initial R-factor of 41.2%. The model from molecular replacement was refined with XPLOR (20.Brünger A.T. X-PLOR version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) using data from 10 to 2 Å. The simulated annealing procedure was used after rigid body refinement. After several cycles of alternating positional and B-factor refinements and manual model building, water molecules were added using the graphics program O (21.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). The assignment of the secondary structure elements was performed using PROCHECK (22.Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12169) Google Scholar). The two PI-SceI structures derived from the two different space group crystals were compared using the Lsq option in the graphics program O (21.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). The program uses an algorithm that searches for the longest matching fragments between the two structures that can be aligned with a given cut-off limit. Atoms were considered to be structurally equivalent if they were within 3.8 Å and within a continuous stretch of at least three equivalent atoms. The construction of a gene that encodes a PI-SceI derivative, PI-SceI (−5Cys), in which five of the six naturally occurring cysteines (Cys-1, Cys-17, Cys-249, Cys-398, and Cys-416) have been changed to serine has been described previously (15.Hu D. Crist M. Duan X. Gimble F.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12621-12628Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cys-75 is not solvent-accessible and is the only remaining native cysteine in this protein. Cysteines were individually introduced into PI-SceI (−5Cys) at positions Arg-91, Lys-97, His-170, Ser-230, Lys-376, and Lys-378 by an overlapping amplification protocol (23.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6809) Google Scholar). The same method was used to construct the H170A and K53A mutant proteins. All mutations were verified by dideoxy sequencing. The wild-type and mutant PI-SceI derivatives were overexpressed and purified by Co2+-metal affinity, SP-Sepharose ion exchange, and Affi-Gel Blue gel chromatography essentially as described (17.He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4607-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) except that reducing agent was omitted during purification. Metals were removed by dialysis against a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol followed by dialysis against conjugation buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA). Protein concentrations were determined by a micro-Bradford assay. DNA cleavage assays were performed as described previously under conditions of protein excess relative to substrate (17.He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4607-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Wild-type PI-SceI or PI-SceI derivative proteins (100 nm) were combined with a linearized plasmid substrate (7 nm) containing a single PI-SceI recognition site, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Cleavage rates for the H170A and H170C proteins were determined as described (17.He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4607-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Native gel mobility shift assays were performed using a 219-bp DNA duplex that contains a single PI-SceI recognition site as described earlier (17.He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4607-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Modification of PI-SceI with 4-azidophenacyl bromide was performed using a modified version of a published procedure (24.Dumoulin P. Oertel-Buchheit P. Granger-Schnarr M. Schnarr M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2030-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) by combining the reagent with the protein at a 20:1 molar ratio for 3 h at room temperature in the dark. To remove unreacted 4-azidophenacyl bromide, the derivatized proteins were dialyzed overnight against 25 mmHEPES (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol. To conjugate PI-SceI to FeBABE, protein (1–5 mg/ml) was mixed with 1 mm FeBABE, and allowed to incubate for 1 h at room temperature as described (25.Murakami K. Kimura M. Owens J.T. Meares C.F. Ishihama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Excess reagent was removed by dialysis. The extent of modification by FeBABE or by 4-azidophenacyl bromide was determined using the fluorescent reagent 7-(diethylamino)-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin according to a published procedure (26.Greiner D.P. Miyake R. Moran J.K. Jones A.D. Negishi T. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Bioconj. Chem. 1997; 8: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). DNA substrates that were 5′-end-labeled on either the top or bottom strands were prepared by digesting a labeled 219-bp polymerase chain reaction product containing a single PI-SceI recognition site with either EcoO109I or SacI, respectively, and by purifying the 158- and 187-bp fragments on a polyacrylamide gel (15.Hu D. Crist M. Duan X. Gimble F.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12621-12628Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). PI-SceI-DNA complexes were formed by incubating the modified protein derivatives (200 nm) with these labeled DNA duplexes (∼0.5 nm) for 20 min in the dark in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA. To effect cross-linking, the mixture was UV-irradiated for 2 min using a Fotodyne transilluminator (312 nm) from a distance of ∼13 cm. The reactions were heated at 70 °C for 10 min, extracted with phenol/chloroform (4:1, v/v), and the phenolic phase was washed with 1 m Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1% SDS. The DNA products were ethanol-precipitated, cleaved with piperidine (1m) for 30 min at 90 °C, and resolved by high resolution gel electrophoresis on an 8 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gel adjacent to a G + A sequencing ladder (27.Papavassiliou A.G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 30: 43-78PubMed Google Scholar). Complexes of FeBABE-modified PI-SceI derivatives and the end-labeled 158- and 187-bp DNA fragments were generated as described previously (15.Hu D. Crist M. Duan X. Gimble F.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12621-12628Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) except that the buffer contained 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 12% glycerol. DNA cleavage by FeBABE was initiated by adding sodium ascorbate (pH 7.0) and hydrogen peroxide to a final concentration of 5 mm and by allowing the reaction to proceed for 2 min at room temperature. The cleavage products were ethanol-precipitated and resolved by electrophoresis on an 8 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. The dried gels were scanned using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) and analyzed using Fragment Analysis software (Molecular Dynamics). The DNA is derived from the I-CreI DNA structure (1bp7; Ref. 10.Jurica M.S. Monnat Jr., R.J. Stoddard B.L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 469-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) by adopting base pairs −10 through +12. This structure was extended from base pair +13 to +22 with a model created using the software program NAMOT (28.Carter E. Tung C.-S. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 25-30PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA roll parameters of the extension were varied in NAMOT to create a DNA structure that satisfied the experimental constraints. The DNA was docked to the C2 space group crystal structure of PI-SceI using methods described previously (15.Hu D. Crist M. Duan X. Gimble F.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12621-12628Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The DNA curvature was determined using CURVES (29.Lavery R. Sklenar H. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1988; 6: 63-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). A new crystal form of the PI-SceI protein was obtained during attempts to crystallize the PI-SceI-DNA complex (30.Duan X. X-ray Structure of PI-SceI, a Homing Endonuclease with Protein Splicing Activity. Ph.D. thesis. Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX1998Google Scholar). Surprisingly, although the crystallization mixture included an oligonucleotide duplex, no DNA was present in the dissolved crystals (30.Duan X. X-ray Structure of PI-SceI, a Homing Endonuclease with Protein Splicing Activity. Ph.D. thesis. Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX1998Google Scholar). The new crystals belong to the C2 space group, while those grown previously belong to the P21 space group. There is one instead of two molecules per asymmetric unit. However, the one molecule dimerizes with one of its crystallographic symmetry-related molecules, and the resulting dimer overlaps the dimer observed in the asymmetric unit of the P21crystal (30.Duan X. X-ray Structure of PI-SceI, a Homing Endonuclease with Protein Splicing Activity. Ph.D. thesis. Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX1998Google Scholar). The structure of the C2 space group crystal was determined by a molecular replacement method and refined at 2.0-Å resolution to an R cryst factor and anR free of 21.2% and 28%, respectively (TableI).Table ISummary of crystallographic analysisParameterValueData Collection Statistics (10–2.0 Å) Multiplicity4 Completeness95% R sym6%Refinement statistics Resolution (Å)10–2.0 Atoms6730 Solvent molecules240 R cryst21.2 R free28.0 r.m.s.ar.m.s., root mean square. of bond length (Å)0.01 r.m.s. of bond angles (degrees)0.18a r.m.s., root mean square. Open table in a new tab The overall PI-SceI structure determined from theC2 space group crystal is very similar to the originally reported structure (Fig. 1), and the root mean square deviation between the C-α atoms of the two structures is 0.9 Å. The same bipartite domain architecture is evident in both structures, and they adopt the same secondary structure folds. The Hedgehog-intein (HINT) module, which is a shared protein fold in the PI-SceI protein splicing domain and in the autoprocessing domain of the Drosophila hedgehog protein (31.Hall T.M.T. Porter J.A. Young K.E. Koonin E.V. Beachy P.A. Leahy D.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), overlaps extensively in the C2 and P21structures with the exception of a loop that connects β6 to β7 (Fig. 1). Residues 135–151, which are part of the DNA recognition region (DRR), are disordered in the C2 structure, but fold in the P21 structure into the four-turn helix α1 and a loop that connects α1 to β12. Conversely, residues 93–102, which spatially neighbor residues 135–151 in the DRR, are disordered in the P21 structure but show density in the C2 structure and form a loop that connects β9 and β10. A second disordered region in the P21structure occurs in the N subdomain of the endonuclease domain that includes residues 271–279, which connect β16 to α6. The disordered segment is further extended in the C2 structure to include β16 and the loop that proceeds β16 (residues 254–280). Finally, the extended β-hairpin loop (residues 369–374) between β21 and β22 that is located above the active site is disordered in theP21 but not the C2 structure. To map interactions between PI-SceI and its recognition sequence, we conjugated FeBABE and/or phenyl azide moieties to surface residues that are in close proximity to amino acids that are critical for PI-SceI binding to DNA. The choice of residues was done in the context of the C2 structure because it is ordered in many of the DNA binding regions. Fig.2 displays the C2 structure of PI-SceI and identifies residues Arg-91, Lys-97, His-170, Ser-230, Lys-376, and Lys-378 that were individually substituted with cysteine and then chemically modified. Substitution of residues Arg-91, Lys-97, Ser-230, Lys-376, and Lys-378 with alanine does not affect the PI-SceI-mediated DNA cleavage activity (17.He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4607-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Arg-91 and Lys-97 neighbor residues Arg-90 and Arg-94 in the protein splicing domain, which contribute to the binding interaction between the DRR and DNA. Lys-376 and Lys-378 are part of the same extended β21-β22 loop as Lys-369 and His-377, which participate in the interaction between the endonuclease domain and the PI-SceI cleavage site region (17.He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4607-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). On the opposite side of the DNA-binding cleft as Lys-369 and His-377, Ser-230 is bordered by residues Asp-229 and Arg-231 in a loop between β14 and α5 (17.He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4607-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The exact role of Asp-229 and Arg-231 is unclear, but they are both critical for the PI-SceI reaction pathway (17.He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4607-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). His-170 occurs in the interdomain region that is part of a ridge of positively charged residues, including Lys-53, His-170, and Lys-173, that extends along the putative DNA contact surface from the endonuclease domain toward the DRR. Unlike the other modified amino acids, His-170 may contribute to DNA binding because alanine substitution at this position reduces the cleavage rate 10-fold relative to wild-type PI-SceI (Fig.3). However, the magnitude of this effect is lower than that caused by other PI-SceI DNA-binding mutants (17.He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4607-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). His-170 spatially neighbors Lys-53, where substitution with alanine reduces the cleavage rate >15-fold relative to wild-type PI-SceI. 2M. Crist and F. S. Gimble, unpublished results.

For this purpose, we utilized a recombinant derivative (PI-SceI (−5Cys)) in which five of the six naturally occurring cysteines have been changed to serine and the sole remaining cysteine is buried in the protein interior distant from the putative DNA binding surface (15.Hu D. Crist M. Duan X. Gimble F.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12621-12628Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We showed previously that the DNA binding and cleavage activities of this variant are similar to wild-type PI-SceI and that the protein is not modified by FeBABE (15.Hu D. Crist M. Duan X. Gimble F.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12621-12628Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Each of the cysteine-substituted PI-SceI proteins was purified using our standard expression and purification protocols (17.He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4607-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The proteins were tested in vitro for their DNA cleavage activities using a linearized plasmid substrate that contains a single PI-SceI recognition sequence (15.Hu D. Crist"
https://openalex.org/W2059373278,"The C-terminal regions of the heterotrimeric G protein alpha-subunits play key roles in selective activation of G proteins by their cognate receptors. In this study, mutant G(s)alpha proteins with substitutions by C-terminal residues of transducin (G(t)alpha) were analyzed for their interaction with light-activated rhodopsin (R*) to delineate the critical determinants of the G(t)alpha/R* coupling. In contrast to G(s)alpha, a chimeric G(s)alpha/G(t)alpha protein containing only 11 C-terminal residues from transducin was capable of binding to and being potently activated by R*. Our results suggest that Cys(347) and Gly(348) are absolutely essential, whereas Asp(346) is more modestly involved in the G(t) activation by R*. In addition, the analysis of the intrinsic nucleotide exchange in mutant G(s)alpha indicated an interaction between the C terminus and the switch II region in G(t)alpha.GDP. Mutant G(s)alpha containing the G(t)alpha C terminus and substitutions of Asn(239) and Asp(240) (switch II) by the corresponding G(t)alpha residues, Glu(212) and Gly(213), displayed significant reductions in spontaneous guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)-binding rates to the levels approaching those in G(t)alpha. Communication between the C terminus and switch II of G(t)alpha does not appear essential for the activational coupling between G(t) and R*, but may represent one of the mechanisms by which Galpha subunits control intrinsic nucleotide exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1974949425,"We have investigated the substrate specificity of the Escherichia coli hemolysin transporter system. Translocation of hemolysin is dependent on a C-terminal signal sequence located within the last 60 amino acids of this protein. Previous comparative studies of the signal sequence have revealed a conserved helix(α1)-linker-helix(α2) motif, suggesting that secondary structure is important for transport. In this study, we generated three random libraries in the α1, linker, and α2 regions, as well as an α1-amphiphilic helical library to identify features buried within the structural motif that contribute to transport. Combinatorial variants were generated by altering the primary sequence of specific regions, and correlation between the genotype and phenotype of the mutant populations allowed us to objectively identify any functional features involved. It was found that the α1-amphiphilic helix and the linker are both important for function. To our surprise, the second helix of the conserved structural motif was not essential for transport. The finding that a predicted amphiphilic helix and hydrophobicity, rather than primary sequence, contribute to transport in the α1 region allows us to speculate on the mechanism of multiple substrate recognition. This may have implications for understanding the broad substrate specificity common among other ATP-binding cassette transporters.

This may have implications for understanding the broad substrate specificity common among other ATP-binding cassette transporters. ATP-binding cassette polymerase chain reaction base pairs(s) The transport of substrates across biological membranes is an essential function of all cells. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC)1 transporter superfamily of proteins plays an active role in this process. They are found in all kingdoms of life, and are involved, for example, in amino acid uptake, phosphate import, protein secretion, polysaccharide export, ion transport, and cellular drug efflux (1.Childs S. Ling V. DeVita V.T. Hellman S. Rosenberg S.A. Important Advances in Oncology. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia1994: 21-36Google Scholar, 2.Dean M. Allikmets R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Because of the high degree of sequence homology among members of this superfamily, it is believed that the fundamental mechanism of transport among ABC proteins is likely to be similar. One of the most captivating questions in the field of ABC transporters is the phenomenon of broad substrate specificity, either as a group or within single members. For instance, in the latter case, two of the best characterized ABC proteins, P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance protein, actively pump a wide variety of chemotherapeutic agents out of cells (3.Chan H.S. DeBoer G. Thorner P.S. Haddad G. Gallie B.L. Ling V. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North Am. 1994; 8: 383-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of these proteins contributes to the multidrug resistance phenotype in many types of cancer in humans.In the present study, we have investigated the substrate specificity of the Escherichia coli hemolysin system. The hemolysin system is a well characterized bacterial ABC exporter (4.Sheps J. Zhang F. Ling V. Rothman S. Membrane Protein Transport. 3. J Press Ltd., London1996: 81-118Google Scholar). Studies to investigate substrate specificity in this system have been facilitated by the fact that hemolysin is a protein substrate, which allows for easy genetic manipulation. Secretion of hemolysin is directed by a signal sequence that is located within the C-terminal 60 amino acids. This short peptide can be secreted by itself (5.Jarchau T. Chakraborty T. Garcia F. Goebel W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), or as demonstrated by fusion protein studies, is sufficient to guide the translocation of foreign proteins directly from the cytoplasm to the outside of cells (6.Hess J. Gentschev I. Goebel W. Jarchau T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 224: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7.Koronakis V. Koronakis E. Hughes C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 8.Mackman N. Baker K. Gray L. Haigh R. Nicaud J.M. Holland I.B. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2835-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 9.Zhang F. Yin Y. Arrowsmith C.H. Ling V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4193-4201Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Defining the specificity of hemolysin transport has been elusive, however. Although the system apparently has one unique substrate, it is able to tolerate a wide variety of primary sequences. Extensive point mutations and minor deletions have been created in the signal sequence but few have had a dramatic effect on transport efficiency (7.Koronakis V. Koronakis E. Hughes C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 10.Chervaux C. Holland I.B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This has led to the proposal that there exists a handful of critical residues scattered throughout the signal sequence that are specifically recognized by the complex to trigger the transport process (11.Kenny B. Taylor S. Holland I.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1477-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12.Kenny B. Chervaux C. Holland I.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, it is assumed that the other amino acids in the signal sequence are able to accommodate a wide range of changes.At the same time, work done in our laboratory has demonstrated that the signal sequence of hemolysin can be replaced by that ofPasteurella hemolytica leukotoxin and still retain wild-type secretion, providing evidence that the two C-terminal signal peptides are functionally equivalent (13.Zhang F. Greig D.I. Ling V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4211-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Comparison of the two signal sequences revealed that they share very little primary sequence homology; however, there appears to be a common predicted helix-linker-helix motif (Fig. 1). This structure has been confirmed by circular dichroism (9.Zhang F. Yin Y. Arrowsmith C.H. Ling V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4193-4201Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and15N nuclear magnetic resonance studies (14.Yin Y. Zhang F. Ling V. Arrowsmith C.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Both of these peptides exhibit similar biophysical properties in that they appear unstructured in an aqueous environment, but they assume an amphiphilic helical secondary structure under certain membrane mimetic environments. A similar motif has also been reported for the C-terminal 56 residues of Erwinia chrysanthemi protease G (15.Wolff N. Ghigo J.M. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. Delepierre M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6792-6801Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which is secreted by a transport system analogous to the hemolysin system. This conservation of secondary structure among different organisms has led to the hypothesis that the helix-linker-helix structural motif within the signal sequence may be a prerequisite for transport. Such a secondary structure may be required for the signal sequence to interact with a “binding pocket” in the transporter complex.The critical residues model and the conserved structural model present two distinct, although potentially overlapping, explanatory frameworks for understanding how the hemolysin signal sequence is recognized by its transporter complex. If both models are correct, it may mean that the “critical” amino acids are presented to the presumptive binding pocket of the transporter in the appropriate three-dimensional orientation as dictated by the conserved secondary structure. In this study, we have investigated the validity of these models in greater detail. We have utilized a combinatorial approach to systematically investigate the range and nature of primary sequences that can be accommodated by the hemolysin transporter system. Three random libraries (α1, linker, and α2) were created based on the structural anatomy of the conserved helix-linker-helix motif. The ability to support transport was then measured in the random variants. This approach has allowed us to generate a very large number of variants, creating a rich data set with the potential to substantiate or refute the above models. For example, we have made the surprising observation that the second helix (α2) conserved in the signal sequence is not required for transport, while the amphiphilic nature of the first helix (α1) is a critical determinant of function.DISCUSSIONThe hemolysin transporter complex is dedicated to the active export of the 107-kDa hemolysin directly from the cytoplasm to the outside of the cell. Although this transporter system has a single natural substrate, it is able to recognize and transport many other different primary sequences, from heavily mutated versions of hemolysin (7.Koronakis V. Koronakis E. Hughes C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 10.Chervaux C. Holland I.B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to protein toxins from other species (13.Zhang F. Greig D.I. Ling V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4211-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To investigate the substrate specificity of the hemolysin transporter complex, we have attempted to identify features within the hemolysin signal sequence that are important for transport. The conserved helix-linker-helix motif within the targeting signal was divided into three regions (α1-linker-α2) and subjected to random oligonucleotide mutagenesis. Using this approach, we have shown that the α1 and linker regions are sensitive to random changes in the primary sequence. For the α1 region, it appears only sequences that result in a predicted amphiphilic helical structure and appropriate hydrophobicity can support efficient transport. In contrast, the α2 region has no specific primary or secondary structural requirements. This is a surprise since this region represents the second helix of the conserved helix-linker-helix motif. While the α2 helix may not be important for secretion, it is possible that this structure is required for some yet unidentified function.A slight variation in the design of combinatorial library allowed us to investigate the structural requirements of the signal sequence at a higher resolution. We have created an amphiphilic helical library to determine the contribution of secondary structure to transport in the absence of other features in the α1 region. Our study revealed that any one of a large number of sequences that yielded a predicted amphiphilic helix in this region is sufficient for transport, demonstrating that there is no specific requirement at the primary sequence level. This is consistent with past reports that the α1 region can tolerate a wide variety of point mutations (10.Chervaux C. Holland I.B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Kenny B. Taylor S. Holland I.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1477-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19.Stanley P. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2391-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Based on our data, it is believed that the higher-order structure is more important for function than primary sequence.In essence, results from the α1 combinatorial libraries demonstrated that while the hemolysin transporter system can accommodate many variations of the substrate, certain restrictions apply. This observation seems to hold for the linker region as well. While the leukotoxin signal sequence could be transported efficiently by the hemolysin transporter system despite a lack of sequence similarity in the equivalent linker region, most hemolysin linker random variants were not secreted at high levels. By analogy to the α1 region, the important features for transport in the linker region are likely to be some occult elements buried within the primary sequence, rather than the specific identity of individual residues.Determination of the identity of the functional features within the hemolysin signal sequence provides the first step in understanding the broad substrate specificity of hemolysin transporter complex. In the case of the α1 region, the conserved amphiphilic helical structure was found to be important for function. Distribution of the 22 amphiphilic helical mutants points to the likelihood that as many as 1.5 × 108 different variants of the α1 region could be transported at greater than 50% of wild-type. It is intriguing that the hemolysin transporter system can tolerate such a large number of primary sequences. If secondary structure is the only functional requirement of the α1 region, what role does it play in transport? Two mechanistically distinct, but not mutually exclusive, explanatory models exist. It has been proposed that the α1-amphiphilic helical structure may be involved in interacting with the membrane (19.Stanley P. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2391-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This allows hemolysin to diffuse in a two-dimensional plane rather than a three-dimensional space, greatly enhancing the chance of substrate binding to the transporter complex. If the functional role of the α1 region is limited to the membrane level, primary sequence does not have to be specific as long as an amphiphilic helix is present.It is also possible that the α1 region is directly involved in interacting with the transporter complex. In this case, the amphiphilic helical structure may be required to present residues within the α1 region in the proper orientation to the binding pocket of the transporter. The ability of the transporter complex to recognize many different primary sequence variations can be explained if this binding pocket contains multiple “contact” residues, all of which could act as potential “docking” sites for residues within the signal sequence. Interaction with any one of several possible combinations of these contact residues would trigger the transport process. Following this rationale, hemolysin and leukotoxin, two proteins that share little primary sequence similarity but which are secreted at equally high efficiency, may actually interact with different sets of contact residues within the binding pocket. Indeed, two point mutants have been isolated in the hemolysin ABC transporter, HlyB, in which the transport of hemolysin was unaffected but the secretion of leukotoxin was reduced (20.Zhang F. Sheps J.A. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19889-19895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Sheps J.A. Cheung I. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14829-14834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This observation could be explained if the two mutated residues specifically recognize leukotoxin and not hemolysin. The large number of specific regional mutants generated in this study could also be used for further genetic complementation analyses to elucidate the intricate nature of this transporter-substrate interaction.HlyB is a member of the ABC transporter superfamily, which is responsible for the translocation of many important substrates across biological membranes. Interestingly, many ABC proteins, such as P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance protein, exhibit broad substrate specificity. Although the hemolysin transporter system is dedicated to the translocation of one natural substrate, our study clearly demonstrates that it can recognize and transport a wide range of signal sequence variants. This raises the possibility that multiple substrate specificity could be an intrinsic property of ABC transporters, and thus the principles of transport proposed for the hemolysin system could be applied in a more general sense. For example, substrates of P-glycoprotein are relatively amphiphilic or hydrophobic in nature. This property is believed to facilitate their partitioning into the plasma membrane before interacting with the transporter (22.Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The high substrate concentration in the membrane environment may help to overcome the specificity issue. It has also been suggested that there are multiple functionally distinct but potentially overlapping binding sites within P-glycoprotein that are responsible for drug efflux (23.Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). This is a parallel interpretation to the multivalent binding pocket of the hemolysin system, in which different substrates may interact with different sets of contact residues to promote transport.In a broader context, combinatorial analysis provides a powerful tool to investigate regions of interest in other biological systems. Random oligonucleotide mutagenesis allows drastic alterations to be engineered into a well defined region while maintaining the natural spatial relationships of the target and non-target regions. Furthermore, a large number of variants can be generated, allowing for a greater degree of confidence in the interpretation of results. The distribution of variants can provide a clear-cut answer regarding the presence of any important features within the target region. Once a region is determined to be important, more in-depth correlation analysis can be carried out on the mutant population to objectively identify the exact features involved. Furthermore, as demonstrated by our helical library, a more specialized design of combinatorial library allows us to dissect primary and secondary structural elements within the same region, and to evaluate them separately for their biological contributions. The transport of substrates across biological membranes is an essential function of all cells. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC)1 transporter superfamily of proteins plays an active role in this process. They are found in all kingdoms of life, and are involved, for example, in amino acid uptake, phosphate import, protein secretion, polysaccharide export, ion transport, and cellular drug efflux (1.Childs S.

This observation could be explained if the two mutated residues specifically recognize leukotoxin and not hemolysin. The large number of specific regional mutants generated in this study could also be used for further genetic complementation analyses to elucidate the intricate nature of this transporter-substrate interaction.HlyB is a member of the ABC transporter superfamily, which is responsible for the translocation of many important substrates across biological membranes. Interestingly, many ABC proteins, such as P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance protein, exhibit broad substrate specificity. Although the hemolysin transporter system is dedicated to the translocation of one natural substrate, our study clearly demonstrates that it can recognize and transport a wide range of signal sequence variants. This raises the possibility that multiple substrate specificity could be an intrinsic property of ABC transporters, and thus the principles of transport proposed for the hemolysin system could be applied in a more general sense. For example, substrates of P-glycoprotein are relatively amphiphilic or hydrophobic in nature. This property is believed to facilitate their partitioning into the plasma membrane before interacting with the transporter (22.Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The high substrate concentration in the membrane environment may help to overcome the specificity issue. It has also been suggested that there are multiple functionally distinct but potentially overlapping binding sites within P-glycoprotein that are responsible for drug efflux (23.Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). This is a parallel interpretation to the multivalent binding pocket of the hemolysin system, in which different substrates may interact with different sets of contact residues to promote transport.In a broader context, combinatorial analysis provides a powerful tool to investigate regions of interest in other biological systems. Random oligonucleotide mutagenesis allows drastic alterations to be engineered into a well defined region while maintaining the natural spatial relationships of the target and non-target regions. Furthermore, a large number of variants can be generated, allowing for a greater degree of confidence in the interpretation of results. The distribution of variants can provide a clear-cut answer regarding the presence of any important features within the target region. Once a region is determined to be important, more in-depth correlation analysis can be carried out on the mutant population to objectively identify the exact features involved. Furthermore, as demonstrated by our helical library, a more specialized design of combinatorial library allows us to dissect primary and secondary structural elements within the same region, and to evaluate them separately for their biological contributions. The hemolysin transporter complex is dedicated to the active export of the 107-kDa hemolysin directly from the cytoplasm to the outside of the cell. Although this transporter system has a single natural substrate, it is able to recognize and transport many other different primary sequences, from heavily mutated versions of hemolysin (7.Koronakis V. Koronakis E. Hughes C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 10.Chervaux C. Holland I.B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to protein toxins from other species (13.Zhang F. Greig D.I. Ling V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4211-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To investigate the substrate specificity of the hemolysin transporter complex, we have attempted to identify features within the hemolysin signal sequence that are important for transport. The conserved helix-linker-helix motif within the targeting signal was divided into three regions (α1-linker-α2) and subjected to random oligonucleotide mutagenesis. Using this approach, we have shown that the α1 and linker regions are sensitive to random changes in the primary sequence. For the α1 region, it appears only sequences that result in a predicted amphiphilic helical structure and appropriate hydrophobicity can support efficient transport. In contrast, the α2 region has no specific primary or secondary structural requirements. This is a surprise since this region represents the second helix of the conserved helix-linker-helix motif. While the α2 helix may not be important for secretion, it is possible that this structure is required for some yet unidentified function. A slight variation in the design of combinatorial library allowed us to investigate the structural requirements of the signal sequence at a higher resolution. We have created an amphiphilic helical library to determine the contribution of secondary structure to transport in the absence of other features in the α1 region. Our study revealed that any one of a large number of sequences that yielded a predicted amphiphilic helix in this region is sufficient for transport, demonstrating that there is no specific requirement at the primary sequence level. This is consistent with past reports that the α1 region can tolerate a wide variety of point mutations (10.Chervaux C. Holland I.B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Kenny B. Taylor S. Holland I.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1477-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19.Stanley P. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2391-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Based on our data, it is believed that the higher-order structure is more important for function than primary sequence. In essence, results from the α1 combinatorial libraries demonstrated that while the hemolysin transporter system can accommodate many variations of the substrate, certain restrictions apply. This observation seems to hold for the linker region as well. While the leukotoxin signal sequence could be transported efficiently by the hemolysin transporter system despite a lack of sequence similarity in the equivalent linker region, most hemolysin linker random variants were not secreted at high levels. By analogy to the α1 region, the important features for transport in the linker region are likely to be some occult elements buried within the primary sequence, rather than the specific identity of individual residues. Determination of the identity of the functional features within the hemolysin signal sequence provides the first step in understanding the broad substrate specificity of hemolysin transporter complex. In the case of the α1 region, the conserved amphiphilic helical structure was found to be important for function. Distribution of the 22 amphiphilic helical mutants points to the likelihood that as many as 1.5 × 108 different variants of the α1 region could be transported at greater than 50% of wild-type. It is intriguing that the hemolysin transporter system can tolerate such a large number of primary sequences. If secondary structure is the only functional requirement of the α1 region, what role does it play in transport? Two mechanistically distinct, but not mutually exclusive, explanatory models exist. It has been proposed that the α1-amphiphilic helical structure may be involved in interacting with the membrane (19.Stanley P. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2391-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This allows hemolysin to diffuse in a two-dimensional plane rather than a three-dimensional space, greatly enhancing the chance of substrate binding to the transporter complex. If the functional role of the α1 region is limited to the membrane level, primary sequence does not have to be specific as long as an amphiphilic helix is present. It is also possible that the α1 region is directly involved in interacting with the transporter complex. In this case, the amphiphilic helical structure may be required to present residues within the α1 region in the proper orientation to the binding pocket of the transporter. The ability of the transporter complex to recognize many different primary sequence variations can be explained if this binding pocket contains multiple “contact” residues, all of which could act as potential “docking” sites for residues within the signal sequence. Interaction with any one of several possible combinations of these contact residues would trigger the transport process. Following this rationale, hemolysin and leukotoxin, two proteins that share little primary sequence similarity but which are secreted at equally high efficiency, may actually interact with different sets of contact residues within the binding pocket. Indeed, two point mutants have been isolated in the hemolysin ABC transporter, HlyB, in which the transport of hemolysin was unaffected but the secretion of leukotoxin was reduced (20.Zhang F. Sheps J.A. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19889-19895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Sheps J.A. Cheung I. Ling V. J. Biol.

The question of how this fascinating task is accomplished has long been a puzzle. Our recent investigation suggests that phi29 DNA packaging is accomplished by a mechanism similar to the driving of a bolt with a hex nut and that six packaging RNAs (pRNAs) form a hexagonal complex to gear the DNA-translocating machine (Chen, C., and Guo, P.

In the current study, circularly permuted pRNAs were used to position an azidophenacyl photoreactive cross-linking agent specifically at a strategic site that was predicted to be involved in pRNA-pRNA interaction. Cross-linked pRNA dimers were isolated, and the sites of cross-link were mapped by primer extension. The cross-linked pRNA dimer retained full activity in phi29 procapsid binding and genomic DNA translocation, indicating that the cross-link distance constraints identified in dimer formation reflect the native pRNA complex. Both cross-linked dimers either containing or not containing the interlocking loops for programmed hexamer formation bound procapsid equally well; however, only the one containing the interlocking loops programmed for hexamer formation was active in phi29 DNA packaging. The cross-linked pRNA dimers were also identified as the minimum binding unit necessary for procapsid binding. Primer extension of the purified cross-linked pRNA dimers revealed that base G82 was cross-linked to bases G39, G40, A41, C49, G62, C63, and C64, which contribute to the formation of the three-way junction, suggesting that these bases are proximate in the formation of pRNA tertiary structure. Interestingly, the photoaffinity agent in the left interacting loop did not cross-link directly to the right loop as expected but cross-linked to bases adjacent to the right loop.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7081-7090Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Mg2+ induces a conformational change of the pRNA (3.Chen C. Guo P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 495-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in the binding of pRNA to the connector, the site where genomic DNA enters and exits the procapsid. The pRNA-enriched procapsids are competent to package DNA in vitro with the aid of a viral-encoded ATPase (gp16) and ATP (4.Guo P. Peterson C. Anderson D. J. Mol.

Recent studies have indicated an intermolecular interaction of pRNA through base pairing between the R loop (base 45–48) and L loop (bases 85–82) (Fig.1) to form a pRNA hexameric complex to gear the viral DNA translocation machine (18.Guo P.

The finding that a hexameric pRNA complex bound to the connector and six pRNAs, worked sequentially (5.Chen C. Guo P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3864-3871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), supports the proposal that the phi29 contains a rotary DNA-packaging machine (Fig. 2). Intensive investigation into pRNA structure and function has revealed that the pRNA contains two functional domains. One of them is the procapsid binding domain located in the middle of the sequence (21.Garver K. Guo P. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 1068-1079PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Trottier M. Zhang C.L. Guo P. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5157-5162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other is a domain composed of the proximal 5′- and 3′-end that is essential for DNA packaging but dispensable for procapsid binding (25.Zhang C.L. Lee C.-S. Guo P. Virology. 1994; 201: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26.Zhang C.L. Garver K. Guo P. Virology. 1995; 211: 568-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that one domain of the pRNA binds to the connector, leaving the 5′/3′ domain free to interact with other components (21.Garver K. Guo P. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 1068-1079PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that pRNA possesses at least two conformations, a relaxed form and a contracted form. Alternating between contraction and relaxation of each member of the hexameric RNA complex driven by ATP hydrolysis may rotate the DNA translocation machine (Fig. 2) (5.Chen C. Guo P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3864-3871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 2A model (from Ref. 5.Chen C. Guo P. J.

The arrows point to the different energetic states of pRNA 1 with variable patterns to illustrate different energetic conformation. A to G depicts 6 steps of a 12° rotation (a 5/6-fold mismatch generates 30 equivalent orientations, 360° ÷ 30 = 12°). Each pRNA rotates 72° after 6 steps to move from one vertex to an adjacent vertex (pRNA 1 moves from vertex a to b). If 1 ATP is needed for 1 pRNA to move from one vertex to another via 1 cycle of contraction and relaxation, then 30 ATPs (6 RNA × 5 vertices) are needed for a 3600 rotation that cause the translocation of one helical turn or 10.5 bases of DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Understanding the specific role that the hexameric pRNA complex plays in viral DNA packaging requires structural knowledge of the pRNA.

However, compensatory modification analysis on the secondary structure of the three-way junction adjacent to the R loop has generated contradictory results. Compensatory changing of the predicted base pairs G38G39/C62C63 to A38A39/U62U63 resulted in an pRNA that was not competent to compete with wild type pRNA for procapsid binding and retained only 50% DNA packaging activity (33.Wichitwechkarn J.

We used circularly permuted pRNAs (cp-pRNAs) (35.Zhang C.L. Trottier M. Guo P.X. Virology. 1995; 207: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 36.Nolan J.M. Burke D.H. Pace N.R.

Science. 1991; 254: 1361-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) to attach a photosensitive cross-linking agent to a nucleotide predicted to be involved in forming a pRNA·pRNA complex in order to investigate its global architecture. We found that the cross-linked dimer retained full biological activity, indicating that the cross-links are relevant to the native structure of the pRNA complex. Primer extension of the intermolecular cross-links revealed several long range interactions that may contribute to the formation of pRNA·pRNA complexes. The bases, predicted within the secondary structure to form the three-way junction adjacent to the R loop, were confirmed to be proximate in the formation of the pRNA tertiary structure.DISCUSSIONThese experiments provide the first structural constraints that bear on the oligomeric pRNA complex. Using circularly permuted pRNAs containing a photoagent attached to a phosphate on which a transcomplementary pRNA loop interacts allowed intermolecular pRNA cross-links to be isolated. Interestingly, the photoaffinity agent in the left interacting loop did not cross-link directly to the right loop as expected but cross-linked to bases adjacent to the right loop. The cross-linking observed is both highly efficient (10–30%) and specific, occurring at only a few nucleotides in each of the transcomplementary pRNAs. Moreover, transcomplementary pRNA B-a′/A-b′ that exhibited both full procapsid binding and DNA packaging activity retained such activity when existing as a cross-linked conjugate. Thus, the data indicate that the cross-linked inter-pRNA conjugates mimic those interactions involved in the formation of hexameric pRNA complexes.The high efficiency of cross-linking observed lends credibility to the structural relevance of the cross-linked species formed. Presumably, the cross-linked species obtained with high efficiency most likely, but not conclusively, represent the most stable (native) structure in the population. Thus pRNAs that adopt the most active (native) conformation yield the most efficient cross-link. The higher efficiency of intermolecular cross-linking that we observed in the reactions containing pRNA pair B-a′/A-b′ is probably due to the fact that in this pair both R and L loops are transcomplementary, although in the inactive pRNA pair I-a′/(A-b′ only the L loop a′ of pRNA I-a′ is transcomplementary to the R loop A of pRNA A-b′.It is noteworthy that individual inter-pRNA-cross-linked conjugates maintained their ability to perform specific biological functions. This again adds to the validity that the cross-linking results obtained in this study may be taken as meaningful constraints on the structure of oligomeric pRNA complexes. The active pRNA pair B-a′/A-b′ allows not only for the formation of dimers but also higher multimers, as demonstrated by its competency to package phi29 DNA into procapsid, a process that requires the formation of a pRNA hexamer (18.Guo P. Zhang C. Chen C. Garver K. Trottier M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 149-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 20.Hendrix R.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Mutant pair I-a′/A-b′ can transcomplement to form dimers but cannot package phi29 DNA, whereas both intermolecular pRNA cross-link conjugates B-a′/A-b′ and I-a′/A-b′ possess similar procapsid binding efficiencies. Therefore, the dimeric pRNA complex is sufficient to achieve full procapsid binding. Further support for this is indicated by the reduced binding efficiency of an uncross-linked mixture of pRNA I-a′ and A-b′. These pRNAs, due to a reduced ability to form dimers (as discussed above), when incubated together consist of both pRNA monomers and dimers. Consequently, pRNA monomers are unable to bind procapsid (TableI and II and Fig. 5), and therefore the mixture possesses a reduced efficiency in procapsid binding as compared with its purified intermolecular cross-link counterpart. Hence pRNA dimers represent the minimum binding unit necessary for procapsid binding.It is interesting to note that the cross-linked sites of both the biologically inactive and active intermolecular-cross-linked conjugates are identical. The photoagent-modified pRNAs vary from one another in the sequence of the R loop but contain common secondary structures. Presumably, the photoagent-modified R loop sequence of the pRNA and interaction with its transcomplementary L loop did not affect the structural features of the L loop with its transcomplementary loop. Based on this result and the secondary structure (Fig. 1), it can be easily imagined that the R and L loops are distant from one another and possibly separated in the tertiary structure such that each loop can interact individually with its transcomplementary loop. The secondary structure positions the cross-link sites to those nucleotides surrounding the base of the R loop (Fig.6). Previous mutational studies using pRNAs with deleted bases within the R loop area (specifically bases G38 and G39) resulted in a pRNA that is inactive in both procapsid binding and DNA packaging (31.Zhang C.L. Tellinghuisen T. Guo P. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 315-322PubMed Google Scholar). These data further support our finding that the cross-link sites identified in this study may be involved in an inter-pRNA interaction.Figure 6Summary of pRNA intermolecular cross-linking sites marked with polygons.

Although these similarities exist between the two pRNA complexes, they differ dramatically in their ability to package DNA. The pRNA complex B-a′/A-b′ maintained the ability to form not only a dimer but also an interlocking hexameric ring, which is needed for DNA translocation (18.Guo P. Zhang C. Chen C. Garver K. Trottier M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 149-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Conversely, the pRNA complex I-a′/A-b′, which is able to form dimers, might not be able to form an interlocking hexameric ring. Thus, the results presented here support previously reported data indicating that an interlocking hexameric pRNA complex is essential for DNA packaging.Finally, we note that the results reported here place constraints on structure models. With an expanded body of cross-linking results and available data concerning pRNA secondary structure, we will be able to develop a model of the structure of the pRNA hexameric complex. The packaging RNA (pRNA)1 of bacteriophage phi29 is a 120-base viral-encoded RNA molecule that is absolutely required in the packaging of viral DNA into its protein shell (1.Guo P. Erickson S. Anderson D. Science. 1987; 236: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 2.Guo P. Bailey S. Bodley J.W. Anderson D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7081-7090Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Mg2+ induces a conformational change of the pRNA (3.Chen C. Guo P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 495-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in the binding of pRNA to the connector, the site where genomic DNA enters and exits the procapsid. The pRNA-enriched procapsids are competent to package DNA in vitro with the aid of a viral-encoded ATPase (gp16) and ATP (4.Guo P. Peterson C. Anderson D. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Upon completion of DNA packaging, the pRNA is released from the connector (5.Chen C. Guo P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3864-3871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and DNA-filled procapsid can subsequently be converted into infectious viral particles with the addition of neck and tail proteins (6.Lee C.S.

The connector of procapsids exhibits a 6-fold symmetry (8.Herranz L. Salas M. Carrascosa J.L. Virology. 1986; 155: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 9.Valpuesta J.M. Fujisawa H.

The relative motion of two rings could provide a driving force for DNA translocation (17.Hendrix R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4779-4783Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated an intermolecular interaction of pRNA through base pairing between the R loop (base 45–48) and L loop (bases 85–82) (Fig.1) to form a pRNA hexameric complex to gear the viral DNA translocation machine (18.Guo P. Zhang C. Chen C. Garver K. Trottier M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 149-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 19.Zhang F. Lemieux S. Wu X. St.-Arnaud S. McMurray C.T.

The finding that a hexameric pRNA complex bound to the connector and six pRNAs, worked sequentially (5.Chen C. Guo P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3864-3871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), supports the proposal that the phi29 contains a rotary DNA-packaging machine (Fig. 2). Intensive investigation into pRNA structure and function has revealed that the pRNA contains two functional domains. One of them is the procapsid binding domain located in the middle of the sequence (21.Garver K. Guo P. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 1068-1079PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Trottier M. Zhang C.L. Guo P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 55-61Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Trottier M. Guo P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 487-494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Reid R.J.D. Bodley J.W. Anderson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5157-5162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other is a domain composed of the proximal 5′- and 3′-end that is essential for DNA packaging but dispensable for procapsid binding (25.Zhang C.L. Lee C.-S. Guo P. Virology. 1994; 201: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26.Zhang C.L. Garver K. Guo P. Virology. 1995; 211: 568-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that one domain of the pRNA binds to the connector, leaving the 5′/3′ domain free to interact with other components (21.Garver K. Guo P. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 1068-1079PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that pRNA possesses at least two conformations, a relaxed form and a contracted form. Alternating between contraction and relaxation of each member of the hexameric RNA complex driven by ATP hydrolysis may rotate the DNA translocation machine (Fig. 2) (5.Chen C. Guo P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3864-3871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the specific role that the hexameric pRNA complex plays in viral DNA packaging requires structural knowledge of the pRNA. The pRNA secondary structure has been proposed through phylogenetic analysis (27.Bailey S. Wichitwechkarn J. Johnson D. Reilly B. Anderson D. Bodley J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22365-22370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Chen C. Zhang C. Guo P. RNA (N.

Chen C. Guo P. Morrison H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Compensatory modification has confirmed specific regions of the pRNA secondary structure, including the 5′/3′ proximal domain (25.Zhang C.L. Lee C.-S. Guo P. Virology. 1994; 201: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 30.Zhang C.L. Tellinghuisen T. Guo P. RNA (N.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18656-18661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, compensatory modification analysis on the secondary structure of the three-way junction adjacent to the R loop has generated contradictory results. Compensatory changing of the predicted base pairs G38G39/C62C63 to A38A39/U62U63 resulted in an pRNA that was not competent to compete with wild type pRNA for procapsid binding and retained only 50% DNA packaging activity (33.Wichitwechkarn J. Johnson D. Anderson D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 34.Reid R.J.D. Bodley J.W. Anderson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9084-9089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Compensatory changing of the predicted base pairs 5′-C50U51G52A53/3′-G61A60C59U58to 5′-A50G51U52C53/3′-U61C60A59G58resulted in a pRNA that was neither competent for procapsid binding nor active in DNA packaging (34.Reid R.J.D. Bodley J.W. Anderson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9084-9089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we used photoaffinity cross-linking to obtain information on the tertiary structure of RNA and to establish proximal regions between pRNA molecules. We used circularly permuted pRNAs (cp-pRNAs) (35.Zhang C.L. Trottier M. Guo P.X. Virology. 1995; 207: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 36.Nolan J.M. Burke D.H. Pace N.R.

Science. 1991; 254: 1361-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) to attach a photosensitive cross-linking agent to a nucleotide predicted to be involved in forming a pRNA·pRNA complex in order to investigate its global architecture. We found that the cross-linked dimer retained full biological activity, indicating that the cross-links are relevant to the native structure of the pRNA complex. Primer extension of the intermolecular cross-links revealed several long range interactions that may contribute to the formation of pRNA·pRNA complexes. The bases, predicted within the secondary structure to form the three-way junction adjacent to the R loop, were confirmed to be proximate in the formation of the pRNA tertiary structure. DISCUSSIONThese experiments provide the first structural constraints that bear on the oligomeric pRNA complex. Using circularly permuted pRNAs containing a photoagent attached to a phosphate on which a transcomplementary pRNA loop interacts allowed intermolecular pRNA cross-links to be isolated. Interestingly, the photoaffinity agent in the left interacting loop did not cross-link directly to the right loop as expected but cross-linked to bases adjacent to the right loop. The cross-linking observed is both highly efficient (10–30%) and specific, occurring at only a few nucleotides in each of the transcomplementary pRNAs. Moreover, transcomplementary pRNA B-a′/A-b′ that exhibited both full procapsid binding and DNA packaging activity retained such activity when existing as a cross-linked conjugate. Thus, the data indicate that the cross-linked inter-pRNA conjugates mimic those interactions involved in the formation of hexameric pRNA complexes.The high efficiency of cross-linking observed lends credibility to the structural relevance of the cross-linked species formed. Presumably, the cross-linked species obtained with high efficiency most likely, but not conclusively, represent the most stable (native) structure in the population. Thus pRNAs that adopt the most active (native) conformation yield the most efficient cross-link. The higher efficiency of intermolecular cross-linking that we observed in the reactions containing pRNA pair B-a′/A-b′ is probably due to the fact that in this pair both R and L loops are transcomplementary, although in the inactive pRNA pair I-a′/(A-b′ only the L loop a′ of pRNA I-a′ is transcomplementary to the R loop A of pRNA A-b′.It is noteworthy that individual inter-pRNA-cross-linked conjugates maintained their ability to perform specific biological functions. This again adds to the validity that the cross-linking results obtained in this study may be taken as meaningful constraints on the structure of oligomeric pRNA complexes. The active pRNA pair B-a′/A-b′ allows not only for the formation of dimers but also higher multimers, as demonstrated by its competency to package phi29 DNA into procapsid, a process that requires the formation of a pRNA hexamer (18.Guo P. Zhang C. Chen C. Garver K. Trottier M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 149-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 20.Hendrix R.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Mutant pair I-a′/A-b′ can transcomplement to form dimers but cannot package phi29 DNA, whereas both intermolecular pRNA cross-link conjugates B-a′/A-b′ and I-a′/A-b′ possess similar procapsid binding efficiencies. Therefore, the dimeric pRNA complex is sufficient to achieve full procapsid binding. Further support for this is indicated by the reduced binding efficiency of an uncross-linked mixture of pRNA I-a′ and A-b′. These pRNAs, due to a reduced ability to form dimers (as discussed above), when incubated together consist of both pRNA monomers and dimers. Consequently, pRNA monomers are unable to bind procapsid (TableI and II and Fig. 5), and therefore the mixture possesses a reduced efficiency in procapsid binding as compared with its purified intermolecular cross-link counterpart. Hence pRNA dimers represent the minimum binding unit necessary for procapsid binding.It is interesting to note that the cross-linked sites of both the biologically inactive and active intermolecular-cross-linked conjugates are identical. The photoagent-modified pRNAs vary from one another in the sequence of the R loop but contain common secondary structures. Presumably, the photoagent-modified R loop sequence of the pRNA and interaction with its transcomplementary L loop did not affect the structural features of the L loop with its transcomplementary loop. Based on this result and the secondary structure (Fig. 1), it can be easily imagined that the R and L loops are distant from one another and possibly separated in the tertiary structure such that each loop can interact individually with its transcomplementary loop. The secondary structure positions the cross-link sites to those nucleotides surrounding the base of the R loop (Fig.6). Previous mutational studies using pRNAs with deleted bases within the R loop area (specifically bases G38 and G39) resulted in a pRNA that is inactive in both procapsid binding and DNA packaging (31.Zhang C.L. Tellinghuisen T. Guo P. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 315-322PubMed Google Scholar). These data further support our finding that the cross-link sites identified in this study may be involved in an inter-pRNA interaction.Comparison of the active intermolecular-cross-linked pRNA dimer B-a′/A-b′ to that of the inactive intermolecular-cross-linked pRNA dimer I-a′/A-b′ indicated that both intermolecular complexes have structural and procapsid binding similarities. Although these similarities exist between the two pRNA complexes, they differ dramatically in their ability to package DNA. The pRNA complex B-a′/A-b′ maintained the ability to form not only a dimer but also an interlocking hexameric ring, which is needed for DNA translocation (18.Guo P. Zhang C. Chen C. Garver K. Trottier M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 149-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar).

We have identified an alternatively spliced seprase messenger from the human melanoma cell line LOX that encodes a novel truncated isoform, seprase-s. The splice variant mRNA is generated by an out-of-frame deletion of a 1223-base pair exonic region that encodes part of the cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane, and the membrane proximal-central regions of the extracellular domain (Val5 through Ser412) of the seprase 97-kDa subunit (seprase-l). The seprase-s mRNA has an elongated 5′ leader (548 nucleotides) that harbors at least two upstream open reading frames that inhibit seprase-s expression from a downstream major open reading frame. Deletion mutagenesis of the wild type splice variant cDNA confirms that initiation of the seprase-s coding sequence begins with an ATG codon that corresponds to Met522 of seprase-l. The seprase-s open reading frame encodes a 239-amino acid polypeptide with an M r∼ 27,000 that precisely overlaps the carboxyl-terminal catalytic region of seprase-l.

The seprase-s open reading frame encodes a 239-amino acid polypeptide with an M r∼ 27,000 that precisely overlaps the carboxyl-terminal catalytic region of seprase-l. fibroblast activation protein α upstream open reading frame seprase-short seprase-long human umbilical vein smooth muscle cells antibody chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction nucleotides base pair(s) kilobase(s) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix is a fundamental property of normal tissue remodeling and repair as well as the pathological processes of tumor invasion and metastasis. In addition to the various families of proteolytic enzymes that serve as the major collagenases and gelatinases such as the matrix metalloproteases, etc. (1.Chen W.-T. Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), a subfamily of membrane-bound nonclassical serine proteases, including seprase and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (CD26), are implicated in matrix degradation and invasiveness of migratory cells (2.Aoyama A.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Seprase is a homodimeric 170-kDa integral membrane gelatinase whose expression appears to correlate with the levels of invasiveness manifested by the human melanoma cell line, LOX, in anin vitro extracellular matrix degradation/invasion assay (7.Monsky W.L. Lin C.-Y. Aoyama A. Kelly T. Mueller S.C. Akiyama S.K. Chen W.-T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5702-5710PubMed Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of its 97-kDa subunit (seprase-l, GenBankTM accession number U76833) predicts a type II membrane topology with a short cytoplasmic tail (6 amino acids) followed by a transmembrane region (20 amino acids) and a large extracellular domain (734 amino acids (8.Goldstein L.A. Ghersi G. Piñeiro-Sánchez M.L. Salamone M. Yeh Y.Y. Flessate D. Chen W.-T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1361: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar)). Its catalytic triad of residues Ser624, Asp702, and His734are contained within a ∼200-amino acid region located in the carboxyl terminus of each subunit. However, seprase requires the dimerization of its inactive subunits for activity (8.Goldstein L.A. Ghersi G. Piñeiro-Sánchez M.L. Salamone M. Yeh Y.Y. Flessate D. Chen W.-T. Biochim. Biophys.

Comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences indicate that seprase is essentially identical to human fibroblast activation protein α (FAPα1; GenBankTM accession number U09278), which is expressed on reactive stromal fibroblasts of various carcinomas and on fibroblasts of healing wounds (10.Scanlan M.J. Raj B.K. Calvo B. Garin-Chesa P. Sanz-Moncasi M.P. Healey J.H. Old L.J. Rettig W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5657-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 11.Garin-Chesa P. Old L.J. Rettig W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7235-7239Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Additionally, seprase exhibits a striking sequence homology (52%) to the ectoenzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (GenBankTM accession number M74777), which increases to a 68% amino acid identity between their catalytic regions (8.Goldstein L.A. Ghersi G. Piñeiro-Sánchez M.L. Salamone M. Yeh Y.Y. Flessate D. Chen W.-T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1361: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Alternative RNA splicing allows for the diversification of the protein products of a single gene not only in terms of their structure but possibly their function and/or cellular localization. Interestingly, several genes that encode proteases associated with tumor invasion and metastasis undergo post-transcriptional RNA splicing. For example, splice variants with altered 5′- and/or 3′-untranslated regions have been reported for cathepsin B (12.Berquin I.M. Sloane B.F. Suzuki K. Bond J. Intracellular Protein Catabolism. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996: 281-294Google Scholar) and L (13.Rescheleit D.K. Rommerskirch W.J. Wiederanders B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). And there is a variant that encodes a truncated cytoplasmic isoform of cathepsin B (14.Mehtani S. Gong Q. Panella J. Subbiah S. Peffley D.M. Frankfater A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13236-13244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Transcription variants have also been identified that encode meprin β′ (15.Dietrich J.M. Jiang W. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2271-2278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and a soluble form of membrane type 3-matrix metalloprotease (16.Matsumoto S.I.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9749-9754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Also, the gene that encodes the murine homolog of FAPα, mFAP (GenBankTM accession number Y10007), is reported to generate two splice variants that encode altered isoforms of the membrane-bound protease (18.Niedermeyer J. Scanlan M.J. Garin-Chesa P. Daiber C. Fiebig H.H. Old L.J. Rettig W.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Functional eukaryotic mRNAs that have one or more AUG codons within their 5′ leader sequences are relatively rare in nature (19.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4148) Google Scholar,20.Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). Indeed, some proto-oncogenes, also genes that control cellular growth and differentiation, and viral genes give rise to mRNAs that possess one or more short upstream open reading frames (uORFs) or minicistrons in their 5′ leaders that do not overlap the downstream major ORF (20.Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar, 21.Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 47: 481-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). And there have been numerous reports that uORFs can function as cis-acting regulatory elements that significantly inhibit the expression of their cognate downstream major ORFs (22.Werner M. Feller A.

Here, we report the identification of an alternatively spliced seprase mRNA from LOX cells that is generated by the utilization of suboptimal exonic 5′ and 3′ splice sites in its pre-mRNA. The resulting messenger is polycistronic; it harbors at least two uORFs in its 5′ leader region that inhibit the expression from a downstream ORF of seprase-s, a truncated isoform of seprase that is identical to the catalytic region of seprase-l. The human amelanotic melanoma cell line LOX was obtained from Dr. O. Fodstad, Institute for Cancer Research, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo, Norway. The human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-436, the human melanotic melanoma cell line SKMEL28, the human embryonic lung fibroblast line WI-38, and the monkey kidney cell line COS-7 were all purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Human umbilical vein smooth muscle cells (HUVSMC) and total RNA were obtained from Dr. S. Steve Okada (Georgetown University). Total RNA from the melanotic melanoma cell line RPMI7951 was obtained from Dr. H. Nakahara (Georgetown University). Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase and recombinantTaq polymerase were from Life Technologies, Inc. Premixed deoxynucleotides were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The mammalian expression vector pCR3.1 was purchased from Invitrogen, and the expression plasmid pCAT3-control vector was purchased from Promega.

Immun-Star chemiluminescent substrate was obtained from Bio-Rad. Amplify, Hyperfilm, andl-[4,5-3H]leucine (136 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membranes were from Millipore. Human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase amplimer set was fromCLONTECH. Isolation of total RNA followed by reverse transcription was carried out as described previously (9.Pineiro-Sanchez M.L. Goldstein L.A. Dodt J. Howard L. Yeh Y. Tran H. Argraves W.S. Chen W.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (Correction (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 13366): 7595-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized that correspond to the following nucleotide (nt) positions of the FAPα cDNA sequence: FAP 1 (5′- CCACGCTCTGAAGACAGAATT-3′ (nt 161–181; sense)); FAP 3 (5′-CCAGCAATGATAGCCTCAA-3′ (nt 1055–1073; sense)); FAP 4 (5′-ACAGACCTTACACTCTGAC-3′ (nt 1863–1845; antisense)); FAP 6 (5′-TCAGATTCTGATACAGGCT-3′ (nt 2526–2508; antisense)); FAP 10 (5′-TAACACACTTCTTGCTTGGA-3′ (nt 1526–1507; antisense)); FAP 11 (5′- TTACATCTATGACCTTAGCA-3′ (nt 598–617; sense)); FAP 12 (5′-AACACTGTGTCCAAAGCAA-3′ (nt 2734–2716; antisense)); and FAP 13 (5′-GAAACTTGGCACGGTATTCAA-3′ (nt 45–65; sense)). PCR was performed using Taq polymerase following the manufacturer's instructions. Two μl of first-strand reaction that was preheated at 94 °C for 5 min and then quick-chilled on ice was added last. A cycling profile of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s (40 cycles) followed by a 15-min extension at 72 °C was routinely used. Samples were analyzed on 1% agarose gels. cDNA amplicons that encode seprase-s were obtained by RT-PCR utilizing either the primer pairs FAP 1 + FAP 6 or FAP 13 + FAP 12 from LOX, MDA-MB-436, or HUVSMC RNA. PCR was either carried out as described above or with the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) utilizing buffer 1, an annealing temperature of 55 °C, and an elongation time of 2.5 min for 30 cycles. Amplicons were isolated from either a 1% agarose gel using a QIAquick gel extraction kit, or PCR reactions were directly purified using QIAquick spin columns (Qiagen). Purified cDNAs were ligated into the pCR 3.1 vector. Ligation, transformation, and selection of recombinant clones were carried out using the eukaryotic TA cloning kit (Bidirectional; Invitrogen). The DNA sequence of seprase-s clones was obtained using the ABI prism dye terminator cycle sequencing kit and an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). The cDNA insert of clone pA12 was sequenced on both strands using primers that generated overlapping sequence data. Primers utilized for the sense strand were: T7 (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′ (vector)); FAP 8 (5′-TCCAAGCAAGAAGTGTGTTA-3′ (nt 1507–1526)); and FAP 5 (5′-TGACAAACTCCTCTATGCAG-3′ (nt 1951–1971)). Primers utilized for the antisense strand: RP-1 (5′-TAGAAGGCACAGTCGAGG-3′ (vector)) and FAP 7 (5′-CTGCATAGAGGAGTTTGTCA-3′ (nt 1970–1951)). Only the sense strand was sequenced for all other seprase-s clones. Sequence analysis was performed using Lasergene software (DNASTAR, Inc.) Determination of the relative levels of seprase-l and seprase-s mRNAs for the human melanoma cell line LOX was obtained by competitive PCR of seprase-l and seprase-s first-strand cDNAs generated from 3 LOX RNA preparations obtained over a 2-year period. First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out as described above. Quantitation of seprase-l cDNA was obtained using a homologous competitive fragment that contains primer template sequences for the primers FAP 10 and 11 (see above). This fragment was produced by overlap extension using PCR (44.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide pair utilized to generate its 159-bp deletion (FAPα cDNA sequence from nt 908 through nt 1066) is FAP L (5′-GATACGGATATACCAGTTGCCTCAAGTGATTATTAT-3′ (sense)) and FAP M (5′-ATAATAATCACTTGAGGCAACTGGTATATCCGTATC-3′ (antisense)). The seprase-l target amplicon generated with the FAP 11+10 primers is 929 bp, whereas the mimic amplicon is 770 bp. Quantitation of seprase-s cDNA was carried out using a homologous DNA mimic that overlaps the truncated region of the seprase-s cDNA sequence and that contains primer template sequences for the primers FAP 1 and FAP 6 (see above). This competitive fragment was also generated by overlap extension using PCR (44.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide pair used to produce its 248-bp deletion (FAPα cDNA sequence from nt 1863 through nt 2110) is FAP N (5′-GTCAGAGTGTAAGGTCTGGCATCTGGAACTGGTCTT-3′ (sense)) and FAP O (5′-AAGACCAGTTCCAGATGCCAGACCTTACACTCTGAC-3′ (antisense)). The seprase-s target amplicon produced with the FAP 1+6 primers is 1143 bp, and its competitive mimic is 895 bp. PCR was carried out withTaq polymerase (see above) using the cycle profile described under “DNA Cloning.” A 25-μl sample of each competitive PCR reaction was resolved on a 1.2% agarose, EtBr gel. The equivalence point for target and mimic amplicon intensities was determined visually. The initial endogenous levels of seprase-l and/or seprase-s cDNAs (in 1 μl of the first-strand cDNA reaction) for each RNA preparation represents the average value of input mimic DNA that generates the target-mimic equivalence point in three distinct titrations. The endogenous levels (average value, value range (attomole (1.0 × 10 −18 mole)) of seprase-l and -s cDNAs synthesized from each of the 3 LOX RNA preparations are: preparation A, seprase-l 0.067, 0.050–0.075 and seprase-s 0.008, 0.006–0.010; preparation B, seprase-l 0.300, 0.300 and seprase-s 0.013, 0.010–0.016; and preparation C, seprase-l 0.135, 0.125–0.150 and seprase-s 0.004, 0.003–0.005. Deletion mutants of seprase-s cDNA were produced from the parental clone pA12 by overlap extension using PCR (44.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide pair for the deletion of the upstream ATG triplet (nt 1 to 3; p11ΔM-1) is FAP F (5′-TTATGGTACAAGATTCTTCCTCCTCAATTTGAC-3′ (sense)) and FAP G (5′-AGGAGGAAGAATCTTGTACCATAAAGTAATTTC-3′ (antisense)). For deletion of the downstream ATG triplet (nt 136 to 138; p24ΔM-2) the oligonucleotide pair is FAP H (5′-AGTAAGGAAGGGGTCATTGCCTTGGTGGAT-3′ (sense)) and FAP I (5′-CAAGGCAATGACCCCTTCCTTACTTGCAAG-3′ (antisense)). The double mutant p14ΔM-1+2 was generated from p24ΔM-2 with the FAP F + FAP G primer pair. PCR was carried out as described above using FAP 1 and/or FAP 6 as the flanking primer(s) for 40 cycles without the 72 °C extension. The same PCR parameters can be used for fusion amplification. Fusion amplicons were subcloned into the pCR 3.1 vector as described above. Gross deletion mutants of the seprase-s cDNA, which delete nt −388 to −266 (p8+6−3) and nt −388 to −62 (p16+6−11), were produced from pA12 by PCR using primer pairs FAP 8 (5′-TCCAAGCAAGAAGTGTGTTA-3′ (nt 1507–1526; sense)) and FAP 6 and FAP 16 (5′-CCAGCTGCCTAAAGAGGAAA-3′ (nt 1711–1730; sense)) and FAP 6, respectively. All other procedures for generating recombinant plasmids were as described above. All deletion mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Seprase-s cDNA and its deletion mutant homologs were expressed in vitro from plasmids (0.5 μg/25 μl) using both the TNT T7-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate and wheat germ extract systems (Promega). Plasmids were not linearized for the wheat germ extract system. Expression was also carried out in uncoupled in vitro transcription and translation. Amplicons (250 ng) containing the T7 promoter and seprase-s cDNA were transcribed using the T7Cap-Scribe kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and RNA transcripts (1 μl) were translated using wheat germ extract (Promega) adjusted to 73 mm K+ and 2.1 mm Mg2+.In vitro translations were carried out in the presense of [3H]leucine. The extent of [3H]leucine incorporation was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation on 5 μl of the reaction followed by liquid scintillation counting. The trichloroacetic acid precipitation value was actually the average value for a 5-μl aliquot from 3 identical reactions. Translation products were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels. The gels were impregnated with Amplify and dried down before undergoing autoradiography. Utilizing overlap extension mutagenesis, a fusion protein construct, p14SC, was generated that linked the cDNA insert of pA12 with one that encodes CAT. This was accomplished using a primer pair that encodes the carboxyl-terminal residues (Cys234 to Asp239) of seprase-s and the amino-terminal residues (Ile5 to Thr10) of CAT. The primer pair had the following sequence: sepCAT-F (5′-TTCTCTTTGTCAGACATCACTGGATATACCACC-3′ (forward)) and sepCAT-R (5′-GGTATATCCAGTGATGTCTGACAAAGAGAAACA-3′ (reverse)). PCR was carried out as described under “Deletion Mutagenesis” using the primer pair FAP 1 and sepCAT-R with pA12 and sepCAT-F and CAT-R (5′-TGTATCTTATCATGTCTGCTC-3′ (nt 1210–1190; pCAT-3)) with the pCAT-3 control vector. Fusion-amplification using the Expand Long Template PCR System and subcloning were as described above. A deletion mutant, p33ΔM-1SC, in which an ATG triplet (nt 1 to 3) was deleted, was derived from p14SC using the primer pair FAP F + FAP G with FAP 1 + CAT-R as the flanking primers. Also, a CAT construct, pCAT, was produced by incorporating the CAT-coding region obtained by PCR using the primers CAT-F (5′-AGCTCTTAAGCGGCCGCAAGC-3′ (nt 451–471; pCAT-3)) and CAT-R into the pCR 3.1 vector. DNA sequence analysis verified all CAT constructs. Transient transfection of COS-7 cells was carried out by electroporation (0.3 kV; 950 microfarads). The electroporated cells were harvested after 72 h and lysed in a detergent extractbuffer (9.Pineiro-Sanchez M.L. Goldstein L.A. Dodt J. Howard L. Yeh Y. Tran H. Argraves W.S. Chen W.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (Correction (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 13366): 7595-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). COS-7 detergent lysates (55 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were probed with a commercially available polyclonal rabbit anti-CAT Ab diluted 1:500. Primary Ab was detected with an anti-rabbit polyclonal Ab conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and diluted 1:20,000. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the Immun-Star substrate. Fig. 6 was obtained by exposing Hyperfilm to the Immun-Star-treated immunoblot for 15 s. This exposure time emphasizes or enhances the sepCAT fusion protein band relative to the CAT band. Reverse transcription-PCR of LOX RNA using the primers FAP 1 and FAP 6, which correspond to nucleotide sequences within the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions, respectively, of the seprase mRNA(s), exhibits two major amplicons at ∼2.4 kb and at ∼1.2 kb (Fig.1). The ∼2.4-kb amplicon was previously shown (8.Goldstein L.A. Ghersi G. Piñeiro-Sánchez M.L. Salamone M. Yeh Y.Y. Flessate D. Chen W.-T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1361: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) to contain the entire coding sequence for the seprase 97-kDa subunit (seprase-l). DNA sequence analysis (Fig.2) of the clone pA12 (GenBankTM accession number AF007822) (cDNA insert contains the entire ∼1.2-kb amplicon (1143 bp)) revealed a 1223-bp deletion of the region extending from nt 61 through nt 1283 of the seprase-l cDNA sequence. Otherwise, it is essentially identical to the reported seprase cDNA sequence. To confirm the existence of a truncated seprase mRNA that gives rise to the ∼1.2-kb amplicon, we carried out RT-PCR on LOX RNA using primer pairs that generate nested fragments along the length of the seprase mRNA(s) (Fig. 1). Those pairs that correspond to nt sequences outside the predicted deleted region exhibit 2 major bands (i.e. seprase-l and -s mRNAs) with a size differential of ∼1.2 kb. However, those pairs which utilize a primer that lies within the deleted region show only one band that corresponds in length to the full-length messenger (i.e. seprase-l mRNA). An additional low intensity intermediate size band was observed with all primer pairs that generate the two major amplicons (Fig. 1 B). We have isolated and sequenced the intermediate band (∼1 kb) produced by the FAP 1+4 primer pair; it is an artifact of PCR (data not shown). Also, three additional truncated cDNA clones obtained by RT-PCR of LOX RNA have been sequenced, and all exhibit precisely the same deletion region as pA12. We estimated the relative abundance of the seprase-l and seprase-s mRNAs in each of three LOX RNA preparations by utilizing competitive PCR of their first strand cDNAs (“Experimental Procedures”). The seprase-l/seprase-s ratios for the 3 RNA preparations are 8.9, 22.7 (this preparation was used in Fig. 1), and 34.6 (this preparation was used in Fig.3, lanes 1–4). In addition, we found that both the seprase-l and -s mRNA levels appear to be fluctuating in each of the three RNA preparations. The preparation that generated the intermediate mRNA ratio of ∼23 has the highest levels of both seprase-l and -s (“Experimental Procedures”).Figure 2Nucleotide sequence of the pA12 cDNA and the deduced amino acid sequences of its uORFs and its major ORF. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence numbers are to the left. The number 1 nucleotide and the first amino acid residue correspond to the major ORF.

Initiation and putative initiation ATG codons and the nucleotides in the −3 and +4 positions relative to these ATG codons (A = +1) are represented by bold characters. The alternative splice junction between nt −329 and −328 is separated by 24underlined nucleotides that represent the extreme 5′ (6 nucleotides) and 3′ (18 nucleotides) ends, respectively, of the deleted 1223-bp exonic region present in the full-length seprase cDNA. Putative exonic splicing enhancer-like motifs are represented bybold italicized characters. Initiation methionine residues are denoted by the bold character M, whereas amino acid residues in the seprase-s ORF that correspond to the catalytic triad (Ser103, Asp181, His213) and the serine protease consensus motif (Gly101, Trp102, Ser103, Tyr104, Gly105) of seprase-l are represented by bold underlined characters.

We constructed a yeast signaling system that resolves domain-specific functions of binding from coupling in the Gα subunit. The endogenous yeast Gα subunit, Gpa1, does not bind to PAR1 and served as a null structural template. N- and C-terminal portions of mammalian Gi2and G16 were substituted back into the Gpa1 template and gain-of-function assessed. The C-terminal third of G16, but not of Gi2, provides sufficient interactions for coupling to occur with PAR1. The N-terminal two-thirds of Gi2 also contains sufficient determinants to bind and couple to PAR1 and overcome the otherwise negative or missing interactions supplied by the C-terminal third of Gpa1. Replacement of the N-terminal α-helix of Gi2, residues 1–34, with those of Gpa1 abolishes coupling but not binding to PAR1 or to βγ subunits. These data support a model that the N-terminal αN helix of the Gα subunit is physically interposed between PAR1 and the Gβ subunit and directly assists in transferring the signal between agonist-activated receptor and G protein.

Many of these complex cellular events are initiated by thrombin cleavage of the protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1)1 at residues Arg41-Ser42 located within the N-terminal extracellular domain. The new N terminus, Ser42-Phe-Leu-Leu-Arg-Asn47, serves as an intramolecular ligand that binds and activates the body of the PAR1 thrombin receptor (1.Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R.

A number of different guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein α-subunits have been shown to couple to PAR1, including members of the Gi, Gq/16, and G12/13 families, but the relative importance of these interactions is not well understood (4.Aktories K.

Recent PAR gene knockout experiments in mice and cloning of two additional thrombin receptors (PAR3 and PAR4) and trypsin/tryptase receptor (PAR2) have shown that different tissues possess a distinct complement of protease receptors that together determine their respective responses to a variety of proteolytic inputs (9.Nystedt S.

A divergence point in protease receptor signaling is that activation of any particular Gα·βγ complex will produce two effectors, namely activated Gα and free βγ (14.Iniguez-Lluhi J. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For instance, since phospholipase C-β can be potentially activated by either Gq or βγ, it is conceivable that non-Gq subunits may serve the negative function of sequestering βγ to prevent constitutive activation of the phospholipase C-β pathway (15.Slepak V.Z. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4037-4041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In platelets, it now seems likely that Gq is the primary effector for phospholipase C-β rather than free βγ. This was demonstrated in Gq gene knockout mice (7.Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.-H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), whose platelets lack thrombin-dependent phosphoinositide responses or the ability to aggregate. The Gq (−/−) platelets retain partial function since they can undergo thrombin-dependent shape change. Therefore, other Gα subunits such as Gi2 and G12/13, must necessarily serve as primary effectors for the dramatic cytoskeletal rearrangements that are a prerequisite for platelet aggregation (16.Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Other functions of platelet thrombin receptors are influenced by Gi-dependent depression of cAMP levels. The cAMP levels in platelets modulate the activity of platelets; high cAMP levels dampen the response of platelets to agonists and cause attenuation of intracellular Ca2+ levels (17.Leibel R.L. Chung W.K. Chua Jr., S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31937-31940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) in part by stimulating Ca2+ efflux by activation of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (18.Dean W.L. Chen D. Brandt P.C. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15113-15119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The role of Gi in PAR1 responses has been shown by specific pertussis toxin blockade of Gi which significantly reduces SFLLRN-stimulated GTPase activity (19.Seiler S.M. Peluso M. Tuttle J.G. Pryor K. Klimas C. Matsueda G.R. Bernatowicz M.S. Mol. Pharm. 1996; 49: 190-197PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known how the Gi family members individually regulate adenylyl cyclase, however, the relative abundance is Gi2 ≫ Gi3 > Gi1 in platelets (20.Williams A. Woolkalis M.J. Poncz M. Blood. 1990; 76: 721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the major unanswered questions of thrombin receptor signaling is why does PAR1 couple to only a subset of the available G protein partners in a given cell? Presently, there is limited information regarding the molecular determinants of PAR1-G protein interactions. A single study by Coughlin and colleagues (21.Vearrall S. Ishii M. Chen M. Wang L. Tram T. Coughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6898-6902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) involved replacing internal cytoplasmic loops of the Gs-coupled β2-adrenergic receptor and the Gi-coupled dopamine D2 receptor with the analogous loops from PAR1. They found that chimeric β2-adrenergic and dopamine D2 receptors bearing the second intracellular loop (i2) from the PAR1 acquire Gq-coupling capability. This led them to conclude that the PAR1 i2 loop may provide “coupling instructions” for Gq specificity in several different receptor contexts but specific PAR1-Gi subunit interactions have yet to be elucidated. With limited high resolution structural data available for receptor-G protein interfaces (22.Kisselev O.G. Kao J. Ponder J.W. Fann Y.C. Gautam N. Marshall G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4270-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), most of the focus on the general molecular determinants of coupling preferences centers on mutagenesis of receptor i3 loops and the extreme C-terminal residues of Gα subunits (23.Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.K. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). For instance, point mutations in the i3 loop of the human muscarinic m2 receptor can compensate for point mutations at C-terminal residues of Gα (24.Kostenis E. Conklin B.R. Wess J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1487-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) consistent with direct intermolecular contact occurring between these regions. Because there are now high resolution x-ray structures of Gαβγ heterotrimers (25.Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 26.Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar), it is possible to genetically map the solvent-accessible surface of the G protein for the complicity of specific residues in receptor binding and activation. The first such study conducted on a large scale consisted of 100 alanine-substituted solvent-exposed residues of Gt that were tested biochemically for impaired interactions with rhodopsin (27.Onrust R. Herznark P. Chi D. Garcia P.D. Lichtarge O. Kingsley C. Bourne H.R. Science. 1997; 275: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Only 9 of the 100 substituted residues were believed to affect solely receptor binding. These sites mapped to the C-terminal 41 amino acids of Gt which contains the β6/α5motif and crucial 11-residue C-tail which are known to mediate receptor-Gα interactions (28.Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). A genetic study of the C-terminal 50 residues of the yeast Gα subunit, Gpa1, correlated well with the mammalian data (29.Kallal L. Kurjan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2897-2907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The potential yeast receptor-Gpa1 interface mapped to 4 of the same 9 residues that were identified in Gt with an additional 11 residues that were located in the α5helix and C-tail. Thus at a genetic level, it appears that the general receptor-Gα contact surface shares similar architectural features between yeast and mammals. Given the inherent difficulty in studying structure-function relationships of specific PAR1-G protein complexes in mammalian cells, we developed a more simplified receptor-G protein yeast model system (30.Price L.A. Kajkowski E.M. Hadcock J.R. Ozenberger B.A. Pausch M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6188-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 31.Kajkowski E.M. Price L.A. Pausch M.H. Young K.H.

Broach J.R. Murphy A.J. Nat. Biotech. 1998; 16: 1334-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) that could be used to elucidate mechanistic details of PAR1-G protein coupling. In the studies presented here, we have replaced the endogenous yeast receptor with the human PAR1 thrombin receptor and obtained high affinity agonist binding and functional coupling to co-expressed G proteins. Determinants of PAR1-G protein coupling are separable from binding activity and are found throughout a large interface that encompasses both N- and C-terminal regions of the Gα subunit. Our data are also consistent with a model that the N-terminal αN helix of the Gα subunit inserts between PAR1 and the Gβ subunit and mediates binding and coupling between agonist-activated receptor and G protein. These genetic and biochemical studies further underscore the advantage of using yeast where one can reconstitute a simple signaling unit consisting of ligand-receptor-G-protein that can be tested for functional properties in isolation from all other mammalian proteins. Human α-thrombin (3433 NIH units/mg) was from Haematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). Restriction enzymes and Vent DNA polymerase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Theste2::URA3-hisG disrupter construct, pSte2KO, was assembled from 5′ (1480 bp) and 3′ (700 bp) flanking sequences ofSTE2 with the 5000-bphisG-URA3-Kan r -hisG fragment from pSE1076 (gift of E. Elion) inserted between them in pUC19. TheSTE2 expression vector, p112-H6T7Ste2Δ300, is derived from the 2-μm TRP1 plasmid, YEplac112 (33.Geitz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar). The 5′-untranslated region of STE2 was amplified by PCR to create a 544-bpSphI-XbaI fragment that was placed into corresponding sites of pUC19 and designated p19–5′UTRH6. The fragment of the STE2 gene encoding amino acid residues Ala4 to Thr297 was amplified by PCR and placed into the XbaI-KpnI sites of p19–5′UTRH6 to create p19-H6T7Ste2. PCR was then used to amplify 200 bp of the 3′-untranslated region of STE2. This 200-bp fragment was ligated into KpnI-EcoRI sites of p19-H6T7Ste2 to create p19-H6T7Ste2Δ300. The 1680-bp SphI-EcoRI fragment was then shuttled into the corresponding sites of YEplac112 and YEplac195 (2 μm URA3 (33.Geitz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar)) to create p112-H6T7Ste2Δ300 and p195-H6T7Ste2Δ300, respectively. The p112-STE2 vector contains the 2010-bp SphI-EcoRI wild-type STE2 fragment amplified by PCR. The thrombin receptor expression vector, p112-H6PAR1Δ379 was created by inserting the region of hPAR1 encoding residues Leu38-Glu377 into the BamHI andKpnI sites of p112-H6T7Ste2Δ300. PCR was used to amplify the cDNA of hPAR1 subcloned into the SalI sites of pBluescript (gift of S. Coughlin). ThisBamHI-KpnI fragment was subcloned into the analogous sites of p112-H6T7Ste2Δ300 to make p112-H6PAR1Δ379. An extra two codons (Met378-His379) were added to the C terminus to accommodate a KpnI restriction site. The hPAR1 gene comprising residues Leu38-Tyr420was amplified with PCR primers (+) 5′-TACTCTCGCGATCTAGACGCAGGCCAGAATCAAAAGCA-3′ and (−) 5′-TCACTATGCATGGATCCGTATATGCTGTTATCCAGGTTACT-3′. A 1205-bpNruI-NsiI fragment was subcloned into theHincII-PstI sites of p19H6T7Ste2Δ300 (1680-bp H6T7Ste2Δ300 fragment subcloned into theSphI-EcoRI sites of pUC19). The 949-bpPstI-KpnI fragment was then subcloned into the corresponding sites of p112-H6PAR1Δ379 to create p112-H6PAR1. This PAR1 construct has the 5 C-terminal amino acids Lys421-Lys-Leu-Leu-Thr425, replaced with GSMQ. The high copy number yeast expression vector pRS426-GPA1 (URA3 2 μm) is the 1900-bp EcoRI fragment ofGPA1 with flanking 5′ and 3′ GPA1 regulatory elements subcloned into pRS426 (gift of S. DeSimone and J. Kurjan). The pPGK-Gi2 vector expresses full-length rat Gi2and the pPGK-Gi2-gpa1 vector expresses a chimera comprising residues 1–212 of Gi2 joined to residues 330–472 of Gpa1 (34.Kang Y.-S. Kane J. Kurjan J. Stadel J.M. Tipper D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2582-2590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pPGK-αN-i2 expresses a chimera that fuses Gpa1 residues 1–42 to residues 35–355 of Gi2. This was made by PCR amplification of the respective regions from the Gpa1 and Gi2 vectors, and subcloning them into pPGK. p195-Gpa1-i2 expresses a chimera encoding residues 1–329 of Gpa1 joined to residues 213–355 of Gi2 under the control of the GPA1promoter in the 2-μm URA3 plasmid, YEplac195 (33.Geitz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar). This was made by PCR amplification of the corresponding GPA1coding sequence plus 200 bases upstream, ligation to the corresponding Gi2 sequence, and subcloning into YEplac195. p195-Gpa1–16 expresses a chimera encoding residues 1–329 of Gpa1 joined to residues 220–374 of G16, under the control of the GPA1promoter. p195-Gpa1–16 was made by replacement of the Gi2sequence in p195-Gpa1-i2 with the sequence encoding residues 220–374 of G16. G16 was amplified from the pCISG16 template by PCR (gift of M. Simon). The yeast strains (TableI) were derived from either W303a or a protease-deficient strain, BJ2168. The chromosomal STE2allele was deleted by homologous recombination (35.Rothstein R.

The BamHI-PvuII fragment of pSte2KO containing ste2ΔhisG-URA3-hisG, was used to transform EY957 and BJ2168, and ura3 −derivatives were recovered by counterselection on 5-fluoroorotic acid media (36.Boeke J.D.

Cells were pelleted, washed in sterile distilled water, and resuspended to a concentration ∼2 × 104 cells/ml in synthetic dextrose media deficient for uracil and histidine. The cells were grown as above, and assayed for absorbance at 600 nm for 2–3 days. Slow growing cultures were split 2-fold, and histidine was added to a final concentration of 20 mg/liter to one set of cultures. Growth and absorbance assays were continued to stationary phase for the cultures with histidine. Cultures (5 ml) of yeast strains harboring His6T7-tagged PAR1 expressed from high copy number (2 μm TRP1) vectors were grown to saturation in CAA-TRP media (1 liter contains 6 g of casamino acids, 2% glucose, 1.7 g of yeast nitrogen base, 5 g of ammonium sulfate, 40 mg of adenine, and 20 mg of uracil) at 30 °C. If coexpression of PAR1 and G-protein was required, the G-protein was expressed from a second vector (2-μm URA3) using media lacking uracil and tryptophan. A dilution of 1:1000 of the overnight culture was made into fresh CAA-TRP (or CAA-TRP-URA) media and grown at 30 °C to a density of 1–1.5 A 600. All further steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells from 2-liter cultures were harvested by centrifugation for 30 min at 3,300 ×g, and resuspended in 200 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm KPO4, pH 7.0, 1 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (38.Wu S.-M. Morris D. Stafford D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2236-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar)). Glass beads (0.5 mm) were then added to the cell suspension (50% v/v) and cells were disrupted in a stainless steel bead beater (Biospec, Bartlesville, OK) equipped with ice-water jacket. The cell lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 8,000 × g and the supernatant (180 ml) subjected to ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h. The crude membrane pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of storage buffer (20 mm KPO4, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) by sonication for 1 min at a power setting of 4–7 on a Branson sonicator and stored as 1 -ml aliquots at −80 °C. Yeast membrane proteins were maintained at 10–15 mg/ml for stability. Ni-chelation Chromatography of His6-tagged PAR1-G Protein Complexes—A 5-ml iminodiacetic acid (IDA)-Sepharose column (Novagen) was charged with 10 ml of 100 mmNiSO4 and equilibrated with 50 ml of 5ImBB (5 mM imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). Typically, 12 mg of crude yeast membrane protein containing H6PAR1/G-protein was applied to the IDA affinity column and recycled for 2 h at 0.38 ml/min. Bound H6PAR1/G-protein was washed with 25 ml of 5ImBB/0.1C (5ImBB + 0.1% CHAPS, w/v), and eluted with 15 ml of 100ImBB/0.1C (100 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1% CHAPS, w/v). Alternatively, 0.1% SDS was substituted for 0.1% CHAPS in the wash (5ImBB/0.1S) and elution buffers (100ImBB/0.1S). The affinity purified H6PAR1/G-protein was dialyzed against 2 × 4 liters of 0.05% SDS, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in 12–14-kDaM r cut-off dialysis bags. 1-ml aliquots of dialyzed H6PAR1/G-protein were transferred to 1.6-ml polypropylene tubes, evaporated to dryness with a Speed-Vac concentrator (Savant), and stored at −20 °C. These dried fractions were reconstituted in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. The high affinity peptide agonist, 56(Ala-(pF-Phe)-Arg-cyclohexylalanine-homoarginine-Tyr-NH2) was a gift from Merck (39.Feng D.-M. Veber D.F. Connolly T.M. Condra C. Tang M.-J. Nutt R.F. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 4125-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Compound 56 was iodinated on tyrosine and purified to radionuclide purity by high performance liquid chromatography by previously described methods (40.Kuliopulos A. Cieurzo C.E. Furie B. Furie B.C. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9436-9444Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The125I-56 peptide was dissolved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, 90% 50T/0.1C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% CHAPS, w/v) as a 50 nm stock solution just prior to use. TRAP peptide (SFLLRN-NH2), and NAc-Ala-(pF-Phe)-Arg-cyclohexylalanine-Arg-Tyr-NH2(NAc-TRAP) were synthesized and purified by M. Berne in the Tufts University Analytical Core Facility. Peptides were stored as 50× stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide at −20 °C. His6T7-tagged receptor-G-protein complexes were partially purified from crude yeast membranes using a ratio of 200 μg of loaded protein/25 μl of Ni-IDA-Sepharose beads. Typically, 5 mg of membrane protein at 10–15 mg/ml was added to 625 μl of Ni-IDA beads in 6.25 ml of 5ImBB. The mixture was rocked at 4 °C for 1 h and washed with 2 × 14 ml of 5ImBB/0.1C, then 2 × 14 ml of 50T/0.1C. The washed Ni IDA-H6T7-receptor(G protein) beads were suspended in 6.25 ml of 50T/0.1C, and 250-μl aliquots distributed into 1.6-ml polypropylene tubes. Binding assays were done in 500-μl systems containing 25 μl of Ni-IDA-H6PAR1(G protein) beads, 1 nmto 1 mm agonist/antagonist peptide, 0.7–0.9 nm125I-56, 2.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (v/v) in 50T/0.1C. The binding mixtures were rocked at 4 °C for 30 min and terminated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g × 30 s. The supernatants containing unbound125I-56 were removed and 10 μl counted in a Packard 5550 γ-scintillation counter. The beads were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 50T/0.1C, filtered over Whatmann 25-mm GF/C glass fiber filters (presoaked in 0.3% polyethylenimine-50T/0.1C), washed 2 × with 5 ml of 50T/0.1C, and filter-bound125I-56 counted. We adapted the assay used for mammalian cells (41.Wieland T. Jakobs K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) to our yeast system with a few modifications. The H6PAR1(G-protein) complexes were prepared as above except we used a ratio of 175 μg of loaded protein per 15 μl of Ni-IDA beads and two washes with 14 ml of TE-HCl (10 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.5) instead of 50T/0.1C. Assays were performed in 200-μl volumes and consisted of 15 μl of Ni-IDA-H6PAR1(G-Protein) beads suspended in 150 μl of TE-HCl, 5 μl of 0.25 nm to 250 μm peptide agonist in 20% dimethyl sulfoxide, 80% TE-HCl, and 40 μl of 5× AB (250 mm TE-HCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 500 mm NaCl, 2.5 nm GTP-γ-35S), ± 5 μl of 10 μm GDP in TE-HCl. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h in 10 × 75-mm polypropylene tubes with shaking at 250 rpm. Assays were terminated by addition of 2.5 ml of ice-cold WB (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2) and filtered through 25-mm GF/C filters. Filters were washed with 2 × 2.5 ml of WB and bound GTP-γ-35S quantitated by β-scintillation counting as described (41.Wieland T. Jakobs K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibody (SFLLR-Ab) directed against the PAR1 ligand region, residues S42FLLRNPNDKYEPF55C, was generated as described previously (42.Kuliopulos A. Covic L. Seeley S.K. Sheridan P.J.

The T7-tag mouse monoclonal antibody (T7-Ab) directed against residues MASMTGGQQM was purchased from Novagen. AS-Ab is the rabbit polyclonal antibody (NEN Life Science Products Inc.) raised against the Gt C-terminal peptide, KENLKDCGLF, which reacts with Gi2 (43.Goldsmith P. Gierschik P. Milligan G.

The Gpa1-Ab is a rabbit polyclonal antibody made against full-length Gpa1 (45.Stratton H.F. Zhou J. Reed S.I. Stone D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6325-6337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In flow cytometry experiments, yeast cells were fixed in 5% formaldehyde for 2 h at 25 °C prior to fluorescent staining. After 2 successive washes with WB2 (100 mm K2HPO4, 100 mmKH2PO4, 1.2 m sorbitol) ∼107 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of WB2 containing 88 units of Lyticase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in a rollodrum to remove the yeast cell wall and form spheroplasts. Intact spheroplasted cells were stained with either the T7-Ab (final concentration 1 μg/ml), or SFLLR-Ab (final concentration 2 μg/ml) for 30 min at 25 °C in the presence or absence of 0.1% Tween 20. This was followed by incubation with secondary antibody for 30 min at 25 °C using either goat anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (10 μg/ml; DAKO) or goat anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (6 μg/ml; Zymed Laboratories Inc.).

Activated JAK2 phosphorylates itself and GHR, thus initiating multiple signaling pathways. In this work, we demonstrate that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) down-regulate GH signaling via a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathway. PDGF substantially reduces tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 induced by GH but not interferon-γ or leukemia inhibitory factor. PDGF, but not epidermal growth factor, decreases tyrosyl phosphorylation of GHR (by approximately 90%) and the amount of both total cellular GHR (by approximately 80%) and GH binding (by approximately 70%). The inhibitory effect of PDGF on GH-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 and GHR is abolished by depletion of 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-sensitive PKCs with chronic PMA treatment and is severely inhibited by GF109203X, an inhibitor of PKCs. In contrast, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase appear not to be involved in this inhibitory effect of PDGF. LPA, a known activator of PKC, also inhibits GH-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 and GHR and reduces the number of GHR. We propose that ligands that activate PKC, including PDGF, LPA, and PMA, down-regulate GH signaling by decreasing the number of cell surface GHR through promoting GHR internalization and degradation and/or cleavage of membrane GHR and release of the extracellular domain of GHR.

It is the primary hormone known to stimulate postnatal longitudinal bone growth and increase body mass (1.Isaksson O.G. Eden S. Jansson J.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 483-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Strobl J.S. Thomas M.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 1-34PubMed Google Scholar). GH deficiency or dysfunction of the GH receptor (GHR) leads to dwarfism, whereas GH in excess results in gigantism or, in adults, acromegaly. In addition to stimulating body growth, GH regulates a variety of other biological functions, including body metabolism and the immune response (2.Strobl J.S. Thomas M.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 1-34PubMed Google Scholar). Clinically, GH has long been used to treat children with short stature. More recently, it has been used to prevent muscle wasting in AIDS patients (3.Tritos N.A. Mantzoros C.S. Am. J.

Rev. 1996; 17: 481-517PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that PDGF and GH cross-talk and modulate each others' action at the cellular level. Cross-talk among different hormones, cytokines, and growth factors has been shown to be an important mechanism regulating the magnitude and specificity of cellular responses and to be involved in many physiological and/or pathological processes. For instance, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) causes insulin resistance by inhibiting insulin signaling at the cellular level (46.Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 47.Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar).In this study, we demonstrate that PDGF, but not epidermal growth factor (EGF), dramatically inhibits GH-stimulated tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 and GHR and rapidly reduces the number of both total and cell surface GHR. Depletion or inhibition of PMA-sensitive PKCs blocks the action of PDGF. In contrast, the MEK/MAP kinase and the PI 3-kinase pathways appear not to be involved in this action of PDGF. LPA, a G protein-coupled receptor that, like PDGF, activates PKC (20.Moolenaar W.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar,21.Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 48.Goetzl E.J. An S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), similarly inhibits GH-stimulated tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 and GHR and reduces the number of GHR by a PKC-dependent pathway. We conclude that PDGF and LPA down-regulate GH signaling via a PKC-dependent pathway by at least in part reducing the level of GHR. It is likely that other ligands that activate PMA-sensitive PKCs down-regulate GH signaling in a similar fashion.DISCUSSIONWe report in this work that PDGF and LPA are potent inhibitors of GH signaling. Pretreating cells with PDGF or LPA dramatically inhibits GH-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase JAK2, a key enzyme in GH signaling. Because tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 correlates with its activation (6.Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Yang X. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Carter-Su C. Cell. 1993; 74: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar), PDGF and LPA most likely strongly inhibit GH-dependent activation of JAK2. Consistent with this idea, GH-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of GHR, a physiological substrate of JAK2, is also severely inhibited by PDGF and LPA. Because activation of JAK2 and tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 and GHR are early obligatory steps in GH signaling (7.Argetsinger L.S. Carter-Su C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1089-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 62.Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Smit L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 187-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), it is likely that most, if not all, downstream signaling events are inhibited by PDGF and LPA.Another important finding of this work is that PDGF and LPA decrease both GH binding and total cellular GHR. PDGF substantially reduces both GH binding and total cellular GHR. The decrease in GH binding and number of GHR roughly correlates with the inhibition of GH-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 and GHR, suggesting that the reduction of GHR is the primary cause of down-regulation of GH signaling by PDGF and LPA. In agreement with this idea, PDGF does not inhibit the activation of JAK2 by LIF or IFN-γ, suggesting that PDGF and LPA do not directly inhibit JAK2.When PMA-sensitive isoforms of PKC are depleted by preincubating cells for 25 h with PMA, neither PDGF nor LPA inhibits GH-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 and GHR, indicating that PMA-sensitive PKCs are required for PDGF- and LPA-induced inhibition of GH action. In support of this hypothesis, GF109203X, a potent inhibitor of PKCs, substantially blocks the inhibition of GH-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 and GHR and the reduction in GHR by PDGF. In agreement with an essential role of PKC in down-regulation of GH signaling by PDGF and LPA, activation of PKC by PMA is sufficient to inhibit GH-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 and GHR and reduce the number of GHR. Interestingly, depletion of PMA-sensitive PKCs blocks the ability of both PDGF and PMA to decrease GH signaling, whereas GF109203X, which is capable of almost completely blocking the ability of PMA to inhibit GH signaling, only partially blocks the inhibitory effect of PDGF on GH signaling. One explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that PDGF stimulates a subset of PKCs that are less sensitive to GF109203X. Different PKCs are known to have different sensitivities to GF109203X (63.Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar).It is unlikely that the MEK/ERK cascade and the PI 3-kinase pathway contribute to the down-regulation of GH signaling by PDGF and LPA. EGF, which activates ERKs 1 and 2 to a similar extent as PDGF, is unable to either inhibit GH-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 and GHR or reduce the number of GHR. In addition, when ERKs 1 and 2 are inhibited by PD98059, a potent inhibitor of MEK, or partially inhibited by 1 μm wortmannin, the inhibitory effect of PDGF on GH signaling is not affected (data not shown). Similarly, inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity with wortmannin completely blocks GH- and PDGF-induced phosphorylation and activation of Akt but does not affect PDGF-induced inhibition of GH signaling.Although it has been reported previously that PMA can regulate levels of GH binding (57.King A.P.J.

Two models have been proposed to explain the inhibition of GH signaling by PMA-sensitive PKCs (57.King A.P.J. Tseng M.J. Logsdon C.D. Billestrup N. Carter-Su C. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the first model (57.King A.P.J. Tseng M.J. Logsdon C.D. Billestrup N. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18088-18094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 58.Suzuki K. Suzuki S. Saito Y. Ikebuchi H. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11320-11327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), activation of PKCs by PMA leads to a redistribution of GHR within the cell, resulting in a reduction of cell surface GHR and an increase in cytoplasmic GHR. Our data do not support the second half of this model (i.e. cytoplasmic GHR are increased in number). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that PMA activation of PKCs increases the rate of internalization of GHR which are then rapidly degraded, resulting in a decrease in the overall number of GHR.In the second model (60.Alele J. Jiang J. Goldsmith J.F. Yang X. Maheshwari H.G. Black R.A. Baumann G. Frank S.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), activation of PKCs by PMA leads to the activation of a protease that cleaves cell surface GHR. This results in the formation of GHR lacking its extracellular domain and release of GH-binding protein (GHBP, the extracellular domain of GHR) from the cell (shedding). Recent evidence suggests that the PKC-regulated protease may be tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-converting enzyme (TACE) or a TACE-like metalloprotease (65.Zhang Y. Guan R. Jiang J. Maheshwari H.G. Baumann C.A. Black R.A. Baumann G. Frank S.J. Proceeding of the 81st Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society, San Diego, CA, June 12–15, 1999. Endocrine Society Press, Bethesda, MD1999: 154Google Scholar). Consistent with a TACE-like metaolloprotease cleaving GHR and producing GHBP, PMA activation of TACE family members has been shown to lead to ectodomain cleavage of the receptors for TNF-α and transforming growth factor-α, the adhesion protein L-selectin, and β-amyloid protein precursor (66.Peschon J.J.

Also consistent with this second model is the finding that the PMA-induced decrease in GHR binding is dependent upon a region of GHR composed of the extracellular and transmembrane domains (57.King A.P.J.

The best evidence for the production of GHBP as a by-product of GHR cleavage comes from studies with GHR from humans and rabbits (60.Alele J. Jiang J. Goldsmith J.F. Yang X. Maheshwari H.G. Black R.A. Baumann G. Frank S.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 68.Sotiropoulos A. Goujon L. Simonin G. Kelly P.A. Postel-Vinay M.C. Finidori J.

Endocrinol. 1997; 153: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), species in which proteolysis is thought to be the major source of GHBP (71.Waters M.J. Kostyo J.L. Handbook of Physiology. V. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 397-444Google Scholar). However, a preliminary report indicates that formation of GHBP as a result of proteolytic cleavage of GHR also occurs with GHR from mice (65.Zhang Y. Guan R. Jiang J. Maheshwari H.G. Baumann C.A. Black R.A. Baumann G. Frank S.J. Proceeding of the 81st Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society, San Diego, CA, June 12–15, 1999. Endocrine Society Press, Bethesda, MD1999: 154Google Scholar), a species for which GHBP is also synthesized from the gene for GHR as an alternative splice product (71.Waters M.J. Kostyo J.L. Handbook of Physiology. V. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 397-444Google Scholar). If proteolysis accounts for at least some of the PKC-induced decrease in GH binding, then it seems likely that PDGF, LPA, or any other ligand that activates PMA-sensitive PKCs will stimulate the production of GHBP in cells that express GHR. Up to 50% of human serum GH is believed to bind to GHBP (72.Baumann G. Amburn K. Shaw M.A. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The interaction of GH with GHBP is proposed to increase the stability of GH. GHBP has also been reported to have inhibitory (73.Hansen B.S. Hjorth S. Welinder B.S. Skriver L. De Meyts P. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2809-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as well as potentiating roles in GH signaling (74.Lim L. Spencer S.A. McKay P. Waters M.J. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1287-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 75.Mannor D.A. Winer L.M. Shaw M.A. Baumann G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1991; 73: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 76.Clark R.G. Mortensen D.L. Carlsson L.M. Spencer S.A. McKay P. Mulkerrin M. Moore J. Cunningham B.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4308-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to regulating the ability of an individual cell to respond to GH, ligands such as PDGF and LPA could also increase the local production of GHBP and thereby modulate GH signaling in neighboring cells. In addition, because PMA is known to activate members of the TACE family of proteases, it seems likely that PDGF and LPA might stimulate the cleavage of the receptors for TNF-α and transforming growth factor-α, the adhesion protein l-selectin, and/or the β-amyloid protein precursor.The finding that PDGF and LPA inhibit GH signaling via a PKC-dependent pathway may have important therapeutic implications. Receptors for PDGF and LPA are members of the receptor tyrosine kinase family and the G protein-coupled receptor family, respectively. Many ligands, including numerous chemical compounds and a variety of hormones, cytokines, and growth factors, are able to activate PKCs. It seems likely that any ligand that activates PMA-sensitive PKCs will also down-regulate GH action. Receptors for a variety of hormones, growth factors, and cytokines that activate PKC, including LPA and PDGF, are expressed in GH target tissues and cells. It is likely that these ligands constantly modulate GH action in vivo by regulating the abundance of GHR on the plasma membrane through a PKC-dependent pathway. Therefore, it is extremely important during GH replacement therapy to be cognizant of the fact that agents that stimulate PKCs will render a given dose of GH much less effective. Similarly, it is important to be cognizant that continuous treatment with agents that stimulate PKCs may inhibit growth.In summary, we have shown that PDGF and LPA inhibit GH-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 and GHR. PDGF and LPA appear to down-regulate GH signaling by decreasing the number of GHR. PMA-sensitive PKCs, but not ERKs 1 and 2 nor PI 3-kinase, are required for these actions of PDGF and LPA. We propose that any ligand that actives PMA-sensitive isoforms of PKC inhibits GH signaling in a similar fashion. Growth hormone (GH)1 is a circulating peptide hormone secreted from the anterior pituitary. It is the primary hormone known to stimulate postnatal longitudinal bone growth and increase body mass (1.Isaksson O.G. Eden S. Jansson J.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 483-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Strobl J.S. Thomas M.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 1-34PubMed Google Scholar). GH deficiency or dysfunction of the GH receptor (GHR) leads to dwarfism, whereas GH in excess results in gigantism or, in adults, acromegaly. In addition to stimulating body growth, GH regulates a variety of other biological functions, including body metabolism and the immune response (2.Strobl J.S. Thomas M.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 1-34PubMed Google Scholar). Clinically, GH has long been used to treat children with short stature. More recently, it has been used to prevent muscle wasting in AIDS patients (3.Tritos N.A. Mantzoros C.S. Am. J. Med. 1998; 105: 44-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 4.Windisch P.A. Papatheofanis F.J. Matuszewski K.A. Ann.

Pierre E. Cox R. Barrow R.E. Ann. Surg. 1995; 221: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). GH exerts its diverse biological functions via GHR. Upon GH binding, GHR binds and activates JAK2, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (6.Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Yang X. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Carter-Su C. Cell. 1993; 74: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 7.Argetsinger L.S. Carter-Su C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1089-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Activated JAK2 then phosphorylates itself and GHR on multiple tyrosines, generating binding sites for other signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 or phosphotyrosine interacting domains, including signal transducers and activators of transcription (8.Campbell G.S. Meyer D.J. Raz R. Levy D.E. Schwartz J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995;"

Phosphorylation of cofilin on serine residue 3 is known to block these activities. We now report that neutrophils contain a protein kinase that selectively catalyzes the phosphorylation of cofilin on serine 3 (≥70%) and a nonspecific kinase that recognizes multiple sites in this protein. The selective serine 3 cofilin kinase binds to a deoxyribonuclease I affinity column, whereas the nonspecific cofilin kinase does not. Deoxyribonuclease I forms a very tight complex with actin, and deoxyribonuclease affinity columns have been utilized to identify a variety of proteins that interact with the cytoskeleton. The serine 3 cofilin kinase did not react with antibodies to LIM kinase 1 or 2, which can catalyze the phosphorylation of cofilin in other cell types. The activity of the serine 3 cofilin kinase was insensitive to a variety of selective antagonists of protein kinases but was blocked by staurosporine. This pattern of inhibition is similar to that observed for the kinase that is active with cofilin in intact neutrophils.

Cytoskel. 1993; 25: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Interestingly, chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophils may establish discrete foci of actin polymerization by activating the Arp 2/3 complex in a manner similar to that observed for L. monocytogenes (16.Weiner O.D.

A considerable body of biochemical data suggest that the NADPH-oxidase complex of neutrophils may be regulated by the actin cytoskeleton (Refs. 17.Quinn M.T. Parkos C.A. Jesaitis A.J. Biochim.

The NADPH-oxidase system catalyzes the production of large quantities of O2−/H2O2, which are key components of the oxygen-dependent, antimicrobial arsenal of these cells (e.g. Ref. 21.Robinson J.M. Badwey J.A. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 103: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Consistent with these biochemical studies, neutrophils stimulated under certain conditions exhibit oscillations in O2−/H2O2production that correlate with periodic extension and retraction of the lamellipodia and polymerization/depolymerization of actin (22.Wyman M.P. Kernen P. Deranleau D.A. Baggiolini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15829-15834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Wyman M.P. Kernen P. Bengtsson T. Anderson T. Baggiolini M. Deranleau D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 619-622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The actin-rich, ruffling membranes of stimulated neutrophils are enriched in products of the NADPH-oxidase complex (11.Heyworth P.G. Robinson J.M. Ding J. Ellis B.A. Badwey J.A. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 108: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21.Robinson J.M. Badwey J.A. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 103: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The actin cytoskeleton in neutrophils and other cell types is regulated by members of the Rho family of small GTPases (e.g. Rac and Cdc42) (e.g. Ref. 1.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). Recent reports have suggested that activated (GTP-bound) Rac mediates actin reorganization, in part, by stimulating LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) (24.Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.H. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 25.Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K.

In particular, neutrophils stimulated with fMLP exhibit a pronounced activation of Rac (27.Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

In this paper, we describe a protein kinase from neutrophils that selectively catalyzes the phosphorylation of cofilin on Ser-3. This enzyme can be separated from a kinase(s) in these cells that recognizes multiple sites in cofilin (by DNase-agarose affinity chromatography) and appears to be distinct from LIMK. Some properties of thisSer-3cofilin kinase (S3ck) are reported. Affi-Gel 10 (N-hydroxysuccinimide active ester-agarose) was purchased from Bio-Rad. 1,4-Phenylene diisothiocyanate (DITC), cyanogen bromide (CNBr), myelin basic protein (MBP), and CAPS were obtained from Sigma. Phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC) was a product of Pierce. DNase I, HA1004, H-7, ML-7, KN-62, and staurosporine were purchased from Calbiochem. Immobilon-P transfer membranes (0.45 μm) were obtained from Millipore Corp. A goat polyclonal antibody to LIMK-2 (LIMK-2 (C-19) Ab) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Co., Santa Cruz, CA. Sources of all other materials are described elsewhere (29.Ding J. Badwey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5234-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Ding J. Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M.

Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These preparations contained >90% neutrophils with viabilities always >90%. Cells were suspended at a concentration of 2 × 108/ml in freshly prepared, ice-cold extraction buffer (20 mmHepes (pH 7.5), 0.40 mm EGTA, 0.40 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.40 mm NAVO4, 0.08 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and disrupted by freeze-thawing three times in a mixture of dry ice and ethanol. The lysate was centrifuged at 200,000 × g(4 °C) for 30 min. The supernatant was saved, and the pellet was resuspended to the original volume in extraction buffer. Both fractions were used immediately. A full-length cDNA clone for human non-muscle cofilin was constitutively expressed in bacteria using the plasmid vector pMW172. For large scale purification, the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0 (purification buffer), sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was applied to a DE52 column equilibrated with purification buffer. After washing with purification buffer, cofilin was eluted with 50 mm NaCl in purification buffer (pH adjusted to 8.0). All steps were performed at 4 °C. Recombinant cofilin purified in this manner was greater than 95% pure, as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis. Typical yields of cofilin from 1 liter of bacteria were between 25 and 50 mg. The protein as eluted from the column was divided into small aliquots and stored at 4 °C for periods of up to 1 month. Cofilin stored in this manner for periods greater than 1 month exhibited substantially less activity than freshly prepared cofilin when utilized as a substrate for S3ck. DNase I was covalently linked to Affi-Gel 10 according to the manufacturer's instructions. After coupling, the gel was washed with 50 mmTris (pH 8.0) to eliminate unreacted N-hydroxysuccinimide esters. The beads were then washed with extraction buffer containing 0.40 m NaCl, followed by extraction buffer alone. The resulting DNase-agarose beads (1.0 ml of swollen beads) were mixed with 3.0 ml of the soluble fraction of neutrophils in a rotating shaker for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were then packed into a small column and extensively washed with extraction buffer (∼50 ml), followed by extraction buffer containing 0.40 m NaCl (∼10 ml). The DNase 1-agarose beads containing the bound proteins were resuspended (1:1) in extraction buffer, and 20 μl of swollen beads were employed in the kinase assays. Cofilin kinase activity was measured as the transfer of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP into recombinant cofilin. In addition to the bound kinase or neutrophil fractions, the final assay mixture (0.10 ml) contained recombinant cofilin (7.5 μm), 20 mmHepes (pH 7.2), 10.0 mm MgCl2, 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi), 0.10 mm EGTA, 2.0 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 2.0 mm NaF, and 20 μmNaVO4. Assays were run for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were then mixed with 12.5 μl of 5× sample buffer, immersed in a boiling water bath for 3.0 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE in 15.0% (w/v) polyacrylamide slab gels (0.075 × 12 × 14 cm). The buffer system of Laemmli was employed (33.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The final concentration of sample buffer after mixing was 1.0% (w/v) SDS, 62.5 mmTris (pH 6.8), 5.0 mm EDTA, 10.0% (v/v) glycerol, 5.0% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.002% (w/v) bromphenol blue.32P-Labeled cofilin was visualized by autoradiography. In a number of experiments, the 32P-labeled cofilin band was excised from the gel after staining with Coomassie Blue and the radioactivity quantified by scintillation counting. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation was calculated from the amount of radioactivity incorporated into cofilin, the specific activity of the [γ-32P]ATP utilized, and the percentage of radioactivity in Ser-3 as determined by Edman degradation (see below). Activity was linear with regard to reaction time and protein concentration in the range employed in these studies. Cofilin was phosphorylated in vitro and subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above.32P-Labeled cofilin was transferred to an Immobilin-P-membrane as described in Ref. 29.Ding J. Badwey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5234-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, except the transfer buffer consisted of 10.0 mm CAPS, 10.0 mmmercaptoethanol, and 15% (v/v) methanol. The 32P-labeled cofilin was “fixed” to these membranes with DITC (34.Pappin D.J.C. Coull J.M. Köster H. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and subjected to manual Edman degradation with PITC as described in Ref. 35.Sullivan S. Wong T.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar. The amount of 32P released in each cycle was determined by liquid scintillation counting. 32P-Labeled cofilin was separated on a 15% SDS-acrylamide “low cross-linked” gel (100:1 (w/v) acrylamide/bisacrylamide). After separation, the cofilin band was cut from the gel and subjected to CNBr digestion as described in Ref. 36.Kolbe H.V.J. Wohlrab H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15899-15906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The resulting peptides were separated on a 16.5% Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel (37.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) and stained with Ponceau Red. Phosphopeptides were visualized by autoradiography. Peptides were identified by sequencing the first 7–8 N-terminal amino acids on an automated gas phase protein sequenator (Applied Biosystems). Mass spectrometry of the peptides was performed on a Perspective Biosystems Elite MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. An immunoprecipitating antibody to LIMK1 was produced in rabbits to the synthetic peptide α-acetyl-KETYRRGESSLPAHPEVPD and purified by affinity chromatography as described in Ref. 38.Wang J.Y. Frenzel K.E. Wen D. Falls D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20525-20534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar. Procedures for immunoprecipitating LIMK1 from neutrophil lysates with the LIMK1 Ab (15 μg of Ab/200 μl of lysate) and for assaying the activity of the precipitated kinase using recombinant cofilin as the substrate were identical to methods previously utilized for the p21-activated kinases (30.Ding J. Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Lian J.P. Badwey J.A J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24869-24873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 39.Lian J.P. Badwey J.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Western blotting for LIMK1 was performed as described in Ref.31.Huang R. Lian J.P. Robinson D. Badwey J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7130-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar. The primary Ab (∼1.5 mg/ml) was diluted 1:2,000, and antigen was visualized with a luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce) followed by autoradiography for 10–30 s (40.Pierce Chemical Co SuperSignal Substrate Western Blotting Kits No. 34081–34086. Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL1996Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, all of the autoradiographic observations were confirmed in at least three separate experiments performed on different preparations of enzyme. The number of observations (n) indicates the number of different preparations of enzyme tested. Recombinant cofilin and [γ-32P]ATP served as substrates to search for protein kinases in neutrophils that were capable of catalyzing the phosphorylation of cofilin. The phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and examined by autoradiography. Both the 200,000 × g soluble and the particulate fractions from neutrophils contained kinases that were active with cofilin (Fig. 1 A). The 32P-labeled cofilin band frequently appeared as a doublet (e.g. Fig. 3 B).Figure 3Binding of a specific cofilin kinase to a DNase-affinity column. Panel A, Coomassie Blue staining pattern for: recombinant cofilin (a), purified actin (b), 200,000 × g soluble fraction from neutrophils (c), proteins that did not bind to DNase-agarose beads (d), and proteins bound to the DNase-agarose beads (e). The soluble fraction of neutrophils was incubated with DNase-agarose beads for 30 min after which the bound and unbound fractions were separated in a microcentrifuge. The positions of cofilin and actin in the gel are designated by a broken arrow(s) andsolid arrow, respectively. Proteins designated by theopen arrowhead, closed arrowhead, and anasterisk were identified by N-terminal sequencing and found to be β-tubulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and DNase, respectively. Panel B, cofilin kinases in the different fractions described above were assayed by monitoring32P-labeled cofilin as described under “Methods.” The autoradiograms shown are for the: soluble fraction not incubated with DNase-agarose (c), unbound fraction (d;i.e. proteins that did not bind to DNase-agarose), bound fraction (e), and bound proteins after washing with 0.40m NaCl (f). Lane g is a control that shows the labeling pattern of proteins bound to agarose beads that do not contain covalently linked DNase. Phosphorylated cofilin frequently appeared as a doublet (broken arrows). Panel Cshows the lower portion of the same autoradiogram presented inpanel B but developed for a shorter period of time. The individual 32P-labeled cofilin bands are designatedI–VI. Panel D summarizes the percentage of32P in Ser-3 for each of the phosphorylated cofilin bands in panel C that are labeled I–VI. The amount of32P in Ser-3 was determined by manual Edman degradation as described under “Methods.” Percentage of 32P in Ser-3 is defined as the amount of radioactivity released in the second cycle of Edman degradation divided by the sum of radioactivity released and the amount of radioactivity that remained bound on the Immobilon-P membrane for that particular band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine if the kinases in these cellular fractions recognized Ser-3 in cofilin, the 32P-labeled cofilin bands were transferred to Immobilon-P-membranes, fixed to the membranes with DITC (34.Pappin D.J.C. Coull J.M. Köster H. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and subjected to manual Edman degradation with PITC (35.Sullivan S. Wong T.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B). The amounts of 32P released in cycle-2 from cofilin phosphorylated in vitro with the soluble and particulate fractions were 32 ± 5.0% and 2.0 ± 0.50% (S.D., n = 3), respectively. Cycle 2 releases Ser-3 from recombinant cofilin because the initial methionine residue (amino acid 1) was removed during the expression of this protein in bacteria. Thus, the soluble fraction of neutrophils contains a protein kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of cofilin on Ser-3. Additional information on the sites in cofilin that undergo phosphorylation in vitro was obtained by digesting the32P-labeled cofilin bands with CNBr and subjecting the resulting peptides to one-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping (Fig.2 A). The first 7–8 N-terminal amino acids of these peptides were sequenced on an automated gas phase protein sequenator (Fig. 2 A, sequenced amino acids provided on the right). All of the identified amino acids could be aligned completely with the predicted sequence of human non-muscle cofilin (41.Ogawa K. Tashima M. Yumoto Y. Okuda T. Sawada H. Okamura M. Moruyama Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 18: 7169Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and were preceded by methionine in accordance with the known cleavage site for CNBr. Peptides p1, p2, and p3 exhibited substantial amounts of 32P (Fig. 2 A). Peptide p3 contained the N-terminal sequence of recombinant cofilin and exhibited a mass of ∼8,200 on mass spectrometry. The mass of p3 indicated that this peptide was a partial hydrolysis product that consisted of amino acid residues 2–74. We were unable to isolate a peptide consisting of residues 2–18 in our system. Peptide p3 generated from cofilin phosphorylated in vitro with the soluble fraction contained substantially more 32P than peptide p3 from cofilin phosphorylated with the membrane fraction (Fig. 2 A, comparep3 in lanes b and c). Peptide p2 contained substantial amounts of 32P in Ser-24 (Fig.2 B). Peptide p1 consisted of residues 116–166 and was also phosphorylated. Thus, neutrophils contain kinases that can catalyze the phosphorylation of cofilin on a variety of sites in vitro. Actin forms a stable complex with cofilin (e.g. Ref. 42.Nishida E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1160-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Since high concentrations of actin are present in the soluble fraction of neutrophils (e.g. Fig.3 A, lane c), we were concerned that this association might interfere with the ability of recombinant cofilin to serve as a substrate. DNase binds actin with very high affinity (e.g. Ref. 43.Markey F. Persson T. Lindberg U. Cell. 1981; 23: 145-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A DNase affinity column was therefore utilized to remove actin from the soluble fraction with excellent results (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, this affinity column also bound a protein kinase(s) that was highly selective for Ser-3 in cofilin (referred to as Ser-3cofilin kinase or S3ck) (Fig. 3,B–D). As noted above, cofilin phosphorylated in vitro with the soluble fraction frequently appeared as a double band after SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3, B and C; lane c, broken arrows). The amounts of 32P in Ser-3 of the upper and lower cofilin bands in lane c were determined by manual Edman degradation and found to be ∼5% and 58%, respectively. A pronounced diminution of the lower phosphorylated cofilin band was observed when the proteins not bound to the DNase-agarose beads were tested for kinase activity (Fig. 3 C, lane d). In contrast, the protein kinase that bound to the DNase-agarose beads catalyzed the phosphorylation/generation of only the lower, 32P-labeled cofilin band (Fig. 3 B, lane e). The kinase bound to the beads (S3ck) was not removed by washing the column with 0.40m NaCl (Fig. 3 B, lane f). After washing with 0.40 m NaCl, the kinase which remained bound to the beads was highly selective for Ser-3 in cofilin with 78% of the32P present in this residue after catalysis (Fig.3 D). This value for six different experiments was 74 ± 5% (n = 6, S.D.). Affi-Gel beads without covalently linked DNase did not contain this kinase activity (Fig. 3 B,lane g). The stoichiometry of phosphate incorporation into Ser-3 of cofilin (7.5 μm) with S3ck bound to the DNase-agarose beads (∼0.8 × 107 cell eq) under the standard assay conditions (37 °C, 20 min) was calculated to be about 0.4 mol of phosphate incorporated/mol of cofilin (0.42 ± 0.12; S.D., n = 4). The specificity of the kinase bound to the DNase-affinity column was further investigated by digesting the product of this reaction with CNBr and examining the resulting phosphopeptides (Fig.4). The predominant32P-labeled peptide was p3 (Fig. 4, lane b), and the amounts of radioactivity in peptides p2 and p1 were markedly reduced when compared with those generated from cofilin phosphorylatedin vitro with the kinases present in the soluble fraction. These data are in agreement with those obtained by the Edman degradation method and further establish that the bound activity selectively recognizes Ser-3 in cofilin (see “Discussion”). Since the bound S3ck has not been purified to homogeneity, we do not know if this activity represents a single enzyme or a group of enzymes. Interactions of recombinant cofilin with the DNase affinity column were investigated (Fig. 5). Significant quantities of unphosphorylated cofilin were bound to the DNase-agarose beads under the conditions of the kinase assay (Fig. 5 A). However, after phosphorylation, 32P-labeled cofilin did not associate with the beads (Fig. 5 B). Phosphorylation of cofilin on Ser-3 is known to result in the dissociation of cofilin-G-actin complexes (10.Morgan T.E. Lockerbie R.O. Minamide L.S. Browning M.D. Bamburg J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 44.Moriyama K. Iida K. Yaha I. Genes Cell. 1996; 1: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). If the binding of S3ck to the DNase-agarose beads was due to the kinase forming a complex with endogenous cofilin associated with the beads, it was possible that S3ck could be released from the beads by exogenous cofilin.

Autocrine fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling promotes survival in SMC in vitro. Interruption of autocrine FGF signaling results in apoptosis that can be rescued by other growth factors such as PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) or EGF (epidermal growth factor). Such heterologous growth factor rescue is prevented by pharmacological inhibition of MAPK, implicating signaling through Ras in mediating survival. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that signaling through Ras is both necessary and sufficient to mediate SMC survival in vitro. Recombinant adenoviruses encoding dominant-negative (RasN17) and constitutively active (RasL61) mutants of Ras were used. RasN17blocks growth factor-mediated MAPK activation and can itself induce SMC apoptosis. RasN17 is synergistic with inhibition of autocrine FGF signaling in triggering apoptosis and prevents heterologous growth factor rescue. Conversely, RasL61prevents apoptosis resulting from inhibition of autocrine FGF signaling. Rescue by RasL61 can be partially prevented by pharmacological inhibition of MEK or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, two downstream effectors of Ras.

Apoptosis is an essential feature of embryonic development and can be documented in a variety of tissues during postnatal life. In the vasculature, apoptosis in the smooth muscle compartment has been demonstrated in response to a sustained reduction in blood flow as a result of the switch from a fetal to a neonatal circulation, as well as in the settings of vascular injury and advanced atherosclerotic lesions. In the first context, the process of apoptosis is clearly a beneficial one and serves to maintain normal circulatory physiology in the face of major changes in hemodynamic requirements. In the latter two examples, it is less certain whether apoptosis represents an adaptive response or a pathological consequence. We have previously demonstrated that autocrine FGF signaling serves to generate and sustain an anti-apoptotic survival signal in vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro (1.Fox J.C. Shanley J.R. J.

Physiol. 1998; 177: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Expression of a dominant-negative FGF1receptor (DN-FGFR) interrupts an autocrine signaling loop in smooth muscle cells and triggers apoptosis. Under these circumstances, survival is critically dependent on reconstitution of anti-apoptotic signaling by stimulation of heterologous growth factor (EGF, PDGF) receptors. The ability of heterologous growth factors to rescue cells expressing DN-FGFR can be blocked by pharmacological inhibition of MEK (MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase). These results suggest a pivotal role for growth factor signaling through Ras in mediating growth factor-dependent smooth muscle cell survival. Ras is a complex multifunctional signaling molecule, receiving multiple inputs and provoking the activity of multiple downstream effectors (3.Marshall M.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized Ras effector pathways is the activation of p42/p44 MAPK via a dual-specificity kinase cascade initiated by activation of the kinase Raf. Ras receives input from growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases via guanine nucleotide exchange factors (4.Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar,5.Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) and may receive activating input from heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors through similar exchange factors or, less directly, through activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases of the Src family (6.Wan Y.

Ras can also activate lipid kinases, especially phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (7.Rodriguez-Viciana P. Marte B.M. Warne P.H. Downward J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.-Biol. Sci. 1996; 351 (discussion 231–2): 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), as well as interact with other divergent effector pathways involving RalGDS (8.Miller M.J. Prigent S. Kupperman E. Rioux L. Park S.H. Feramisco J.R. White M.A. Rutkowski J.L. Meinkoth J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5600-5605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), c-jun N-terminal kinase via other dual specificity kinase cascades (9.Wang X.S. Diener K. Jannuzzi D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31607-31611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and related small monomeric G proteins of the Rho family (10.Khosravi-Far R. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 57-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Various reports in the literature have documented an important role for Ras and its effector pathways in influencing cellular behavior and, in particular, cell survival. Signals responsible for survival in the pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 may depend on activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and dominant-negative inhibition by RasN17 does not appear to affect survival (12.Yao R.J. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Dominant-negative inhibition by RasN17 alone may even be sufficient to protect PC12 cells from apoptosis (13.Ferrari G. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5922-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), but the data from these two studies conflict on this point. In transformed fibroblasts, radiation-induced apoptosis can be prevented by expression of constitutively active Ras (14.Arends M.J. McGregor A.H. Toft N.J. Brown E.J. Wyllie A.H. Br. J. Cancer. 1993; 68: 1127-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 15.Chen C.H. Zhang J. Ling C.C. Radiat. Res. 1994; 139: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Conversely, expression of constitutively active Ras is associated with enhanced sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis (16.Fernandez A. Marin M.C. McDonnell T. Ananthaswamy H.N. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2009-2017PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-α in transformed fibroblasts is prevented by bFGF, and this protection is abrogated by expression of RasN17 (17.Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14560-14566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Many pathways inducing apoptosis are inhibited by Bcl-2, and overexpression of constitutively active Ras induces Bcl-2 and protects from apoptosis caused by growth factor withdrawal in hematopoietic cells (18.Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2207-2212PubMed Google Scholar). The present study was designed to test whether Ras activity is both necessary and sufficient to mediate vascular smooth muscle cell survival in vitro and to probe candidate signaling pathways downstream of Ras that might be responsible for this activity. The regulation of smooth muscle apoptosis may be as important as migration and proliferation in a variety of disease processes. By determining the signaling mechanisms responsible for mediating smooth muscle cell survival, we may ultimately be able to manipulate these mechanismsin vivo for the therapeutic benefit of patients with vascular disease. The construction and preparation of the recombinant adenoviruses used in these experiments have been previously described. These include constructs encoding the dominant-negative FGF receptor (Ad.DN-FGFR) (2.Miyamoto T. Leconte I. Swain J.L. Fox J.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), β-galactosidase (Ad.CMVlacZ, gift of Dr. James Wilson, University of Pennsylvania) (19.Yang Y. Raper S.E. Cohn J.A. Engelhardt J.F. Wilson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4601-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and the Ras mutants RasN17 and RasL61 (gift of Dr. Joe Nevins, Duke University) (20.Leone G. DeGregori J. Sears R. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1997; 387: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Working stocks of virus were prepared by large scale infection of 293 cells with purified seed stocks as described previously and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Ad.DN-FGFR or its lacZ control were used to infect cells at an m.o.i. of 250. The Ras adenoviruses were used at the m.o.i. indicated in the figures (50–500) or in the figure legends. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells (gift of Dr. Gary Owens, University of Virginia) between passages 9 and 12 were cultured and infected with recombinant adenoviruses as described previously (1.Fox J.C. Shanley J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12578-12584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells were treated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Alexis Corp., San Diego, CA) or the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 (Alexis Corp.). Cell counts were obtained by hand counting of trypsinized cell suspensions using a hemacytometer. Tissue culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. unless otherwise specified. To determine the phosphorylation state of p42erk1 and p44 erk2 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), a Western blot assay was employed as described previously (2.Miyamoto T. Leconte I. Swain J.L. Fox J.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Smooth muscle cells were serum deprived for 48 h. During this period of serum deprivation, cells were either sham-infected or infected with recombinant adenoviruses to allow transgene expression for 48 h prior to ligand stimulation and analysis. Cells were exposed to 25 ng/ml recombinant bFGF for variable times, harvested by direct lysis in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, assayed for total cell protein (Bio-Rad), and up to 8 μg of cell protein per sample was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electrophoretic transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were probed first with a polyclonal antibody specific for the phosphorylated forms of p42/p44 MAPK and then re-probed with a different polyclonal antibody recognizing both the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of MAPK (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Similar assays were performed using paired antibodies directed against p38 MAPK and c-akt (New England Biolabs) under the same conditions. Quantitative terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays were performed as described previously (2.Miyamoto T. Leconte I. Swain J.L. Fox J.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated dUTP kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). We have previously demonstrated that interruption of an autocrine FGF signaling loop in vascular smooth muscle cells triggers apoptosis. In the case of expression of a DN-FGFR, cell death can be prevented by other peptide growth factors. The receptors for these growth factors activate some signaling molecules in common with FGFR. The MEK inhibitor PD98059 can block rescue by these other growth factors, implicating the MAPK activation cascade in mediating a survival signal in vascular smooth muscle cells (2.Miyamoto T. Leconte I. Swain J.L. Fox J.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Heterologous activation of the MAPK pathway may be sufficient to mediate survival in this context, but we considered whether other signaling pathways downstream of Ras might also be involved. Activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) has also been identified as an important downstream effector of Ras, and PI3K (and the downstream kinase c-akt) has been implicated in promoting cell survival in other systems. As an initial test of the hypothesis that activation of PI3K might contribute to survival in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, cells expressing DN-FGFR were treated with the growth factors bFGF (25 μg/ml), EGF (100 μg/ml), or PDGF (25 μg/ml) in the absence or presence of wortmannin (100 nm), an inhibitor of PI3K. Fig.1 shows that wortmannin effectively blocks the ability of heterologous growth factors (EGF, PDGF) to rescue cells expressing DN-FGFR to an extent comparable with 30 μm PD98059. This result further implicates signaling through Ras in activating effector signaling pathways promoting survival in vascular smooth muscle cells. To test directly whether Ras activity is both sufficient and necessary to mediate survival in vascular smooth muscle cells, we employed adenoviral expression of two mutants of Ras, one of which is constitutively active (RasL61) and one of which acts as a dominant-negative (RasN17). Expression of these Ras mutants was characterized biochemically in terms of the ability to activate or block, respectively, the downstream effectors MAPK and c-akt. Expression of the constitutively active and dominant-negative Ras mutants was also characterized biologically in terms of their ability to promote or antagonize the survival of cells expressing DN-FGFR. To demonstrate the biochemical consequences of Ras mutant expression, we used Western blot assays for phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK (erk1/erk2) and c-akt as evidence for activation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways, respectively. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells were cultured under conditions designed to reveal whether Ras activity was either necessary or sufficient to lead to activation of these pathways and to promote or antagonize cell survival. To test whether expression of RasL61 was sufficient to activate the MAPK and c-akt pathways in SMC, cells were infected with adenoviruses encoding lacZ (as control) or DN-FGFR, with or without concomitant infection with RasL61, and maintained in growth medium (10% fetal bovine serum). In addition, cells were treated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (30 μm), the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (100 nm), or a combination of these inhibitors. After 48 h, cell lysates were analyzed for MAPK and c-akt activation. Fig. 2 shows that RasL61 expression results in constitutive MAPK and c-akt phosphorylation, regardless of whether cells were also expressing DN-FGFR. The addition of the MEK inhibitor PD98059 substantially inhibited the ability of RasL61 expression to result in constitutive MAPK phosphorylation. Compared with a clear signal of phosphorylated c-akt in cells expressing RasL61, addition of wortmannin markedly reduced the degree of c-akt phosphorylation. Treatment with PD98059 also reduced the level of c-akt phosphorylation, and wortmannin treatment led to a reduced signal for phosphorylated MAPK. Combining the inhibitors resulted in levels of phosphorylation similar to treatment with either inhibitor alone; similar results were obtained when the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 μm) was substituted for wortmannin (data not shown). To characterize the biochemical consequences of blocking Ras activity, cells were infected with recombinant adenoviruses encoding either the dominant-negative mutant RasN17 or lacZ as a control and allowed to express the transgenes for 48 h under serum-free conditions. Following stimulation with bFGF, EGF, or PDGF the cells were analyzed for MAPK and c-akt activation. These data demonstrate that RasN17 blocks the ability of these growth factors to stimulate MAPK (Fig. 3) or c-akt (Fig. 4) phosphorylation.Figure 4Activation of c-akt by bFGF , PDGF , or EGF is antagonized by the dominant-negative mutant RasN17. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells were sham-infected (Un) or infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing lacZ (LZ) or RasN17 and were then incubated in serum-free medium for 48 h prior to treatment with vehicle (−) or bFGF, PDGF, or EGF (+) as described in the legend for Fig. 3. Extracts were prepared and probed by Western blotting for the phosphorylation state of c-akt activated by bFGF (top two panels), PDGF (middle two panels), or EGF (bottom two panels). Each pair of panels was sequentially probed with an antibody recognizing only the phosphorylated form of c-akt (anti-P akt) followed by an antibody recognizing the total c-akt signal (anti-T akt).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether Ras activity was itself sufficient to mediate SMC survival in this model, cells expressing DN-FGFR (or lacZ as control) were co-infected with the virus encoding RasL61 in the absence or presence of biochemical inhibitors. Fig.5 shows that RasL61 is able to prevent apoptosis triggered by DN-FGFR (-adds) as measured by a quantitative assessment of the proportion of apoptotic cells using TUNEL staining. Proliferation (as measured by cell count) is not increased in lacZ-expressing control cells that also express RasL61 (data not shown). This is consistent with the observation that Ras activity alone is insufficient to provoke proliferation (and the transformed phenotype) in nonimmortalized cells (20.Leone G. DeGregori J. Sears R. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1997; 387: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). As a further demonstration that Ras signaling to MAPK is involved in SMC survival, in cells expressing DN-FGFR (or lacZ as control) and RasL61, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 partially prevents RasL61 from rescuing cells expressing DN-FGFR. We considered that other signaling pathways activated by Ras such as PI3K and the downstream kinase c-akt might contribute to mediating a survival signal in this model. To test this possibility, cells expressing DN-FGFR (or lacZ) and RasL61were also treated with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin or a combination of PD98059 and wortmannin. Fig. 5 also shows that wortmannin partially blocks the ability of RasL61 to rescue cells from apoptosis triggered by DN-FGFR and that the effects of PD98059 and wortmannin may be additive. This last observation must be interpreted cautiously, however, in light of the results of the biochemical readouts using these inhibitors in this experimental system. Of additional interest in this experiment is the observation that control cells expressinglacZ with or without RasL61 display slightly increased apoptosis in the presence of PD98059 or wortmannin, suggesting that these signaling pathways are important to cell survival under basal conditions (i.e. in the absence of DN-FGFR or mutant Ras expression). We next determined whether Ras activity was necessary for SMC survival in the absence of any other influence (i.e. with the autocrine FGF signaling loop intact but without additional growth factors present). Fig. 6 shows that RasN17 expression alone provokes SMC apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Using a dose of RasN17adenovirus that inhibits MAPK or c-akt phosphorylation (Figs. 3 and 4) and triggers apoptosis (Fig. 6), cells were co-infected with DN-FGFR (or lacZ) and RasN17 to determine whether RasN17 either amplified the pro-apoptotic influence of DN-FGFR expression or blocked the ability of PDGF or EGF to rescue cells expressing DN-FGFR. Fig. 7 shows that even low levels of RasN17 enhance the pro-apoptotic consequences of interrupting the autocrine FGF signaling loop with DN-FGFR and prevent the ability of PDGF or EGF to rescue DN-FGFR-triggered apoptosis.Figure 7The dominant-negative mutant RasN17 antagonizes the ability of heterologous growth factors to rescue apoptosis triggered by a dominant-negative FGF receptor. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells expressing a dominant-negative FGF receptor (DNFR, black bars) or lacZ (LZ, hatched black bars) were compared with companion cultures co-infected with the dominant-negative mutant RasN17 (DNFR/N17, gray bars; LZ/N17, hatched white bars) with respect to their susceptibility to apoptosis in the absence (−GF) or presence (+) of bFGF, PDGF, or EGF. Following 2 days in culture under these conditions, the proportion of apoptotic cells was determined by quantitative TUNEL staining as described in the legend for Fig. 1. Data points represent the mean ± S.D. of triplicate samples. This experiment was repeated three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previously published experiments from our laboratory established the importance of an autocrine FGF signaling loop in promoting survival in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (1.Fox J.C. Shanley J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12578-12584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 2.Miyamoto T. Leconte I. Swain J.L. Fox J.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and in vivo experiments in the rat carotid injury model are consistent with the physiological relevance of this signaling loop (21.Hanna A.K.

Fox J.C. Golden M.A. J. Vasc. Surg. 1997; 27: 126-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Using growth factors that activate heterologous tyrosine kinase receptors to rescue cells expressing a DN-FGFR, we have shown that pharmacological inhibition of the MAPK kinase MEK could block rescue (2.Miyamoto T. Leconte I. Swain J.L. Fox J.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These observations implied that growth factor signaling through Ras is necessary to mediate survival under these circumstances. Data presented in this report directly address the hypothesis that Ras activity is both necessary and sufficient to mediate vascular smooth muscle cell survival in vitro. The dominant-negative mutant RasN17 was able to block both biochemical evidence of growth factor activation of the Ras pathway (MAPK phosphorylation) and PDGF or EGF rescue of DN-FGFR-triggered apoptosis. Indeed, RasN17 by itself was able to trigger apoptosis in the absence of other manipulations, and this consequence of Ras blockade was insensitive to added growth factors. Conversely, expression of a constitutively active RasL61 mutant led to biochemical evidence of constitutive activation of both MAPK and c-akt, downstream effectors of Ras, even in the presence of DN-FGFR co-expression. Expression of RasL61 was also able to promote SMC survival in the presence of DN-FGFR co-expression in the absence of an influence on cell proliferation. Pharmacological inhibitors of these downstream Ras effector pathways substantially abrogated the ability of RasL61 to promote survival under these conditions. These experiments provided unanticipated evidence for possible cross-talk between the MAPK and c-akt pathways in the biochemical readouts (phospho-specific Western blots). PD98059, considered a selective MEK inhibitor, was able to reduce the degree of phosphorylation of c-akt in response to RasL61expression. Similarly, wortmannin (or LY294002), a reportedly selective PI3K inhibitor, was able to reduce the signal of phospho-MAPK in response to RasL61. These data are consistent with the observations of other investigators examining the activity of these signaling pathways in the presence of these kinds of pharmacological inhibitors (23.Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27665-27670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 24.Ai W. Gong J. Yu L.

Busa W.B. Dev. Growth Differ. 1998; 40: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), although it should be noted that such cross-talk appears to be cell type- and context-specific. Supported by these observations of other investigators, the present results suggest that, in the context of strong, constitutive activity of Ras, persistent activation of either the MAPK or c-akt pathways may be co-dependent in vascular smooth muscle cells. These experiments were not designed to definitively characterize the pathways downstream of Ras as protecting smooth muscle cells from apoptosis. However, the results strongly suggest that a survival signal or signals, generated in a tonic manner by Ras, result from autocrine FGF signaling in vascular smooth muscle or, in its absence, from similar tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors signaling through Ras. Whether Ras activity promotes or antagonizes survival appears to depend on the cell type and the signaling mechanism responsible for initiating apoptosis. For example, Ras promotes cell cycle progression, and therefore, in the case of apoptosis being triggered by circumstances such as DNA damage by ionizing radiation, which normally results in cell cycle arrest and attempts at DNA repair, constitutive activation of Ras promotes apoptosis. On the other hand, in models of growth factor deprivation characterized by the interruption of signaling through receptors that activate the Ras pathway, ectopic stimulation of this pathway (either through heterologous growth factor receptors or expression of a constitutively active Ras) supports cell survival. Unfortunately, elucidation of the actual mechanisms responsible for regulating cell survival through the varied effector pathways downstream of Ras may not be quite so straightforward, as contrary examples to these observations about the role of Ras vis-à-vis cell cycle progression versus trophic factor deprivation have also been reported. Part of the reason for these different results could be that Ras activates a variety of signaling pathways other than the MAPK cascade (29.Akasaka K. Tamada M. Wang F. Kariya K. Shima F. Kikuchi A. Yamamoto M. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5353-5360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30.Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D.

These other pathways include PI3K and the related activation of the kinase c-akt, which itself has been implicated in mediating anti-apoptotic signals, as well as the c-jun N-terminal kinase pathway via MAPK kinase kinase 5. Ras is also reported to activate related small monomeric G proteins such as Rac, Rho, cdc42, and RalGDS. The final outcome in a particular cell type under specific circumstances may well depend on a fine balance between signaling through various effector pathways receiving input from Ras and other signaling pathways subserved by alternative mechanisms, such as other protein kinase cascades, cyclic nucleotides, lipid kinases, phospholipases, phosphatases, or neutral lipids such as ceramide. If the outcome of such a balance in signal transduction mechanisms in a particular cell type is regulated in a physiological manner, how can we relate the results presented here to the environment of the vascular smooth muscle cell in vivo? Apoptosis in the vascular smooth muscle compartment has been documented under a variety of circumstances, but these have as a common theme the context of vascular remodeling. Little is known about how alterations in growth factors and potentially pro-apoptotic cytokines might affect smooth muscle cell survival in the context of vascular remodeling in these different scenarios in vivo, but some important clues are provided by studies of smooth muscle cell apoptosis in vitro. The current study and previous work from our laboratory supply evidence that smooth muscle cells possess an autocrine mechanism to provide trophic support in a manner reminiscent of other models of trophic factor dependence, such as the interleukin-3-dependent myeloid cell line BaF3 and the neurotrophin-dependent cell line PC12. Other studies have documented that inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and γ-interferon can promote smooth muscle cell apoptosis, as can directly pro-apoptotic factors such as Fas ligand. In some cases the signals promoting survival or apoptosis have been at least partially identified. The challenge remains to integrate these seemingly disparate bits of information into a coherent model of survival regulation in a physiological context. The present study provides a model of autocrine regulation that can be used to test the relative importance and interdependence of some of these other signaling cascades in vitro and, with the availability of genetically manipulated animal models, in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2040445190,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects the central nervous system and plays a direct role in the pathogenesis of AIDS dementia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying HIV-1 expression in the central nervous system are poorly understood. We have recently reported that the nuclear receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF), an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is an activator of HIV-1 gene transcription. Here, our results show that COUP-TF stimulates HIV-1 transcription in primary cultured human microglial cells, the primary target for HIV-1 infection in brain. Run-on assays indicated that COUP-TF acts on the initiation step of transcription. Results from reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry analysis further revealed the importance of this factor by demonstrating that overexpression of COUP-TF leads to initiation of viral replication in primary HIV-infected human microglia. In addition, COUP-TF is able to physically interact and cooperate with the viral transactivator Tat. The combination of COUP-TF and Tat leads to NF-kappaB- and Sp1-independent enhanced transcriptional stimulation. In vitro binding studies showed that COUP-TF interacts with Tat through amino acids within the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of COUP-TF. Amino acids 48-72 in the basic and C-terminal regions of Tat are required for the binding of Tat to COUP-TF. These results suggest that COUP-TF is an essential transcription factor involved in HIV-1 expression in microglia and reveal a novel interplay of Tat and COUP-TF during regulation of viral expression."

The H2a variant on the other hand is a precursor of a cleaved soluble form that is secreted. Uncleaved H2a precursor molecules cannot exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a lumenal juxtamembrane pentapeptide being responsible for their retention. Insertion of this pentapeptide into H1 (H1i5) causes its complete ER retention but not fast degradation as happens to H2a. Cotransfection of H2a elicited, by heterodimerization, the Golgi processing of H1i5 and its surface expression. This occurred to a much lesser extent by cotransfection of H2b. Likewise, coexpression of H1i5 and not H1 stabilized H2a and caused its export to the cell surface. Homodimerization of molecules containing the pentapeptide did not cancel the retention. Thus, only when the pentapeptide is present in both subunits is the ER retention efficiently abrogated. The results show the unexpected finding that identical ER retention signals present in two associated chains can mask and cancel each other's effect. This could have important implications as similar abrogation of ER retention of other proteins could eventually be obtained by engineering and coexpressing an associated protein containing the same retention signal.

Likewise, coexpression of H1i5 and not H1 stabilized H2a and caused its export to the cell surface. Homodimerization of molecules containing the pentapeptide did not cancel the retention. Thus, only when the pentapeptide is present in both subunits is the ER retention efficiently abrogated. The results show the unexpected finding that identical ER retention signals present in two associated chains can mask and cancel each other's effect. This could have important implications as similar abrogation of ER retention of other proteins could eventually be obtained by engineering and coexpressing an associated protein containing the same retention signal. endoplasmic reticulum asialoglycoprotein receptor endo-N-acetylglucosaminidase H dithiothreitol difluorodinitrobenzene T cell receptor polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline Many proteins have been shown to undergo endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 retention and degradation (1.Bonifacino J.S.

In numerous cases, the substrates are unassembled subunits of hetero-oligomeric receptors. Extensive studies have been performed with unassembled subunits of the human asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) (3.Shenkman M. Ayalon M. Lederkremer G.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11363-11368Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 4.Lederkremer G.Z. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1237-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Wikstrom L.

Terhorst C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 973-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 7.Wileman T. Kane L.P. Young J. Carson G.R. Terhorst C. J.

It was found for some TCR subunits that domains responsible for the ER retention and degradation overlap with the determinants for assembly. For example, the α subunit contains a charged 9-amino acid peptide in the membrane span that determines both the degradation and the assembly with CD3 δ (9.Bonifacino J.S. Cosson P. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1990; 63: 503-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The association between the chains is through charged pairs (10.Cosson P. Lankford S.P. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1991; 351: 414-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Similarly, CD3 subunits can protect the TCR β chain from degradation. In this case, the transmembrane domain is also responsible but does not seem to be sufficient as replacement of the TCR β chain ectodomain impeded that protection (7.Wileman T. Kane L.P. Young J. Carson G.R. Terhorst C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the case of the hetero-oligomerization of α and β integrins, a juxtamembrane-charged peptide in the cytoplasmic domain of the α subunit is responsible for both assembly and retention of the unassembled subunit (11.Pardi R. Bossi C. Inverardi L. Rovida E. Bender J.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1252-1263PubMed Google Scholar). Colocalization of determinants for ER degradation and assembly occurs also in soluble proteins as is the case of IgM monomers for which a carboxyl-terminal cysteine was identified as a signal for those processes (12.Alberini C.M. Bet P. Milstein C. Sitia R. Nature. 1990; 347: 485-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The ASGPR H2a polypeptide is different in the fact that no membrane-bound protein leaves the ER, when singly expressed or together with other subunits. In order to exit, it is cleaved to a fragment that encompasses the whole ectodomain. This soluble fragment can then be secreted (13.Tolchinsky S. Yuk M.H. Ayalon M. Lodish H.F. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14496-14503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The cleavage was shown to occur in the ER (5.Wikstrom L. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Amara J.F. Lederkremer G. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3315-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), probably by signal peptidase (15.Yuk M.H. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1735-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Membrane-bound H2a is thus a precursor of the soluble form, and uncleaved precursor molecules are retained in the ER and degraded. In contrast to H2a, an alternatively spliced variant, H2b, was shown to travel to the cell surface to a significant extent, also when singly expressed (4.Lederkremer G.Z. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1237-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The only difference between H2a and H2b is a juxtamembrane pentapeptide in the ectodomain, EGHRG. We showed that the H2a pentapeptide causes ER retention but not degradation when inserted into the H1 subunit in the same position (3.Shenkman M. Ayalon M. Lederkremer G.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11363-11368Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, unlike other proteins in which the signals for ER retention and degradation seem to overlap, H2a must have a separate determinant for degradation. In HepG2 cells, it is H2b that constitutes with the H1 subunit the cell surface receptor complex while H2a is efficiently cleaved and its ectodomain secreted (13.Tolchinsky S. Yuk M.H. Ayalon M. Lodish H.F. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14496-14503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). H1 and H2b form hetero-oligomers with an average molar relation of (H1)3:(H2b)1 on the surface of HepG2 cells (16.Henis Y.I. Katzir Z. Shia M.A. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1409-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), although the prevalent species seen in vitro is (H1)2:(H2b)2 (17.Bider M.D. Wahlberg J.M. Kammerer R.A. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31996-32001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). When H1 and H2b were coexpressed in NIH 3T3 cells, there was some protection from degradation, and a larger fraction of both subunits was processed through the Golgi than when singly expressed. Coexpression of H1 and H2a had no effect, H1 was processed to the same extent, and H2a degraded in the ER at the same rate as when singly expressed (13.Tolchinsky S. Yuk M.H. Ayalon M. Lodish H.F. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14496-14503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We report here that H2a is efficiently protected from degradation and also induced to exit the ER, traverse the Golgi, and reach the cell surface by coexpression with a complementary H1 subunit in which we introduced in the same juxtamembrane position the pentapeptide retention signal from H2a. Likewise, the mutated H1, while completely retained in the ER when singly transfected, was exported when coexpressed with H2a. Thus, an ER retention signal can mask and cancel its own function when present in two subunits of a protein complex that can undergo hetero-oligomerization. Rainbow 14C-labeled methylated protein standards were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Pro-Mix cell labeling mix ([35S]methionine plus [35S]cysteine) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; >1000 Ci/mmol. Protein A-Sepharose was from Repligen (Cambridge, MA). Endo-N-acetyl glucosaminidase H (endo H) was obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). N-Glycanase was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Goat anti-rabbit and streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase were from Jackson Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Difluorodinitrobenzene (DFDNB) and sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate) were from Pierce. Protease inhibitors and other common reagents were from Sigma. NIH 3T3 cells expressing H2a (2-18 cell line) or H2b (2-C cell line) were transfected with a pMEX-neo vector containing H1i5 (3.Shenkman M. Ayalon M. Lederkremer G.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11363-11368Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using a calcium phosphate transfection protocol (18.Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As the cell lines were already resistant to G418, they were simultaneously cotransfected with a puromycin resistance plasmid pBabe-puro (19.Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). After selection with puromycin representative clones of these cells: 2-18-2, expressing H1i5 plus H2a and 2-C-2, expressing H1i5 plus H2b were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) plus 10% calf serum under 5% CO2. Other 3T3 cell lines expressing H1 (1-7 cells), H2a (2-18 cells), H2b (2-C cells), H1 plus H2a (AH1–1 cells) (13.Tolchinsky S. Yuk M.H. Ayalon M. Lodish H.F. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 11363-11368Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) were grown in the same conditions. Polyclonal antibodies specific for peptides corresponding to the carboxyl termini of H1 or H2, H2 amino terminus, or specific for the extra H2a pentapeptide (anti-H2a antibody) were the ones used in earlier studies (4.Lederkremer G.Z. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1237-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Tolchinsky S. Yuk M.H. Ayalon M. Lodish H.F. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol.

Monolayers of cells at a confluence of about 90% in 60-mm tissue culture dishes were rinsed and preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with cysteine-free DMEM plus 10% dialyzed calf serum. They were then pulse-labeled for 10–20 min in the same medium containing 0.5 mCi/ml Pro-Mix mixture of [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine with addition of 5 mm unlabeled methionine. The monolayers were then rinsed and chased for different periods of time with normal DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum as described (3.Shenkman M. Ayalon M. Lederkremer G.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11363-11368Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13.Tolchinsky S. Yuk M.H. Ayalon M. Lodish H.F. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14496-14503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The cells were rinsed with PBS and lysed with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in PBS in the presence of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Immunoprecipitations from cell lysates or supernatants (1.2 ml from 60-mm dishes) and endo H and N-glycanase treatments were performed as described before (3.Shenkman M. Ayalon M. Lederkremer G.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11363-11368Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13.Tolchinsky S. Yuk M.H. Ayalon M. Lodish H.F. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14496-14503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were incubated with 0.05–0.1 mm DFDNB in PBS for 60 min at 4 °C with constant rocking. They were then incubated with 5 mm glycine in PBS for 5 min, washed three times in PBS, and solubilized in detergent for immunoprecipitation. Reducing SDS-PAGE was performed on 12% Laemmli gels except where stated otherwise. For non-reducing conditions, the samples were boiled for 5 min in a buffer consisting of 62.5 mmTris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol. For reducing conditions 3.5% β-mercaptoethanol was included in the buffer. The gels were analyzed by fluorography using 20% 2,5-diphenyloxazole and exposing to BioMax MR film from Eastman Kodak Co. Quantitation was performed in a Fuji phosphorimager. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Blocking was done with 5% low fat milk and 0.1% Brij-35 in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. This was followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody. The blot was then washed three times in PBS containing 0.1% Brij-35 and incubated for 60 min at room temperature with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to peroxidase. In the case that a biotinylated primary antibody was used, this was followed by incubation with streptavidin conjugated to peroxidase. The blots were washed with PBS, and detection was performed with ECL and exposure to Agfa CP-BU film. Biotinylation of antibodies was done by incubating IgGs (purified on protein A-Sepharose) with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin in 0.1 msodium borate, pH 8.8, for 4 h at room temperature (IgG:sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin mass ratio 5:1), followed by addition of 20 mm NH4Cl for 10 min. The biotinylated antibodies were then dialyzed against PBS. The procedures employed on non-permeabilized cells were as described previously (3.Shenkman M. Ayalon M. Lederkremer G.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11363-11368Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The secondary antibody used was indocarbocyanine (Cy3)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG from Jackson Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Photography on an Axioskop fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Berlin, Germany) was done at identical exposure times between samples to be able to compare signal intensities. The 15 base pairs that encode the extra pentapeptide of human ASGPR H2a as compared with H2b were introduced into the same juxtamembrane position of the H1 subunit (Fig.1 A). This construct, H1i5, was stably expressed in NIH 3T3 cells (3.Shenkman M. Ayalon M. Lederkremer G.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11363-11368Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We studied the expression and processing of the H1i5 polypeptide in a representative transfected cell line, 5-D, by metabolic labeling with [35S]cysteine, chasing for different times, and immunoprecipitation from cell lysates with an anti-H1-carboxyl-terminal antibody followed by SDS-PAGE. The pentapeptide caused a complete retention of H1 in the ER, but unlike H2a (4.Lederkremer G.Z. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1237-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) it is very stable toward degradation (Fig. 1 B). We had shown that H1i5 folds properly so that the retention is not due to misfolding (3.Shenkman M. Ayalon M. Lederkremer G.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11363-11368Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Wild type H1 can self-assemble (17.Bider M.D. Wahlberg J.M. Kammerer R.A. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31996-32001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), so one possibility was that the ER retention of the mutant was due to its inability to homo-oligomerize. We reasoned that it could, however, still be able to assemble with the H2 subunit, so we doubly transfected the cells expressing H1i5 with H2a or H2b. In effect, the coexpression of H2a caused a substantial recovery of the ability of the H1i5 polypeptide to exit the ER and transit through the Golgi. After a 4-h chase, H1i5 was converted to a product of 46 kDa resistant to endo H (Fig.1 C, lanes 5 and 6), similar to the one produced by wild type H1 (Fig. 1 C,lane 11). In contrast, coexpression with H2b elicited only minor Golgi processing of H1i5 (Fig.2, A, lane 8; B). Therefore, it is the specific association of H1i5 with H2a, both expressing the EGHRG pentapeptide, that leads to a circumvention of the retention signal.Figure 2Coexpression with H2b allows only a minor degree of Golgi processing of H1i5. A, cells stably cotransfected with expression vectors encoding H1i5 and H2b (2-C-2 cell line, lanes 1, 2, 8, and9), H1 and H2b (1-7-1 cell line, lanes 3, 4, 10, and 11), only H1 (1-7 cell line, lanes 6 and 13) or only H2b (2-C cell line, lanes 5, 7, and12) were metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine for 20 min, chased with complete medium for different times as indicated and processed as in Fig. 1. On theright are molecular sizes of protein standards in kilodaltons. On the left are indicated the positions for migration of the precursor and Golgi-processed (mature) proteins. Note that, even in the presence of H2b, almost no H1i5 is Golgi-processed after the chase period (lane 8). B, the gels depicted in Fig. 1 (B and C) and inpanel A were quantitated in a Fuji phosphorimager. The amounts of precursors (left) or mature forms (right) after a 4-h chase were plotted as compared with the pulse-labeled precursor (=100), for H1i5 (white bars), H1i5 in the presence of H2a (black bars), and H1i5 in the presence of H2b (gray bars).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We analyzed whether there was any surface expression of H1i5 by immunofluorescence on non-permeabilized transfected NIH 3T3 cells. H1i5 gave no surface immunofluorescence. However, upon coexpression of H2a, the surface expression was similar to the one observed with wild type H1 (Fig. 3). H1i5 gave a minor level of surface expression when together with H2b, which is consistent with the results of the Golgi processing seen by metabolic labeling (Fig. 2). Therefore, association of H1i5 with H2a and, to a much lesser extent, with H2b caused the abrogation of the retention signal and allowed it to transit through the entire secretory pathway to its final cell surface destination like wild type H1. H2a is cleaved in the ER next to the membrane span, probably by signal peptidase (15.Yuk M.H. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1735-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The cleaved fragment, corresponding to the entire ectodomain, is then secreted. This process occurs very efficiently in HepG2 cells but also to some degree in 3T3 transfectants (13.Tolchinsky S. Yuk M.H. Ayalon M. Lodish H.F. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14496-14503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). When H1i5 was coexpressed with H2a, it gave a small amount of an intracellular cleaved fragment (Fig. 1 C). We analyzed whether there was any secreted product by metabolic labeling with [35S]cysteine followed by chase. Cell supernatants were then immunoprecipitated using anti-H1-carboxyl-terminal antibody and the products run on SDS-PAGE. Singly expressed H1i5 gave no secreted products after a 4-h chase (Fig. 4,lanes 1 and 2). No secretion could be seen either for shorter or longer chase periods, up to 8 h (data not shown). However, when coexpressed with H2a, several bands were seen concentrating around two regions, 30 kDa and 40 kDa (Fig. 4,lane 6). The latter would be similar to the migration of the secreted fragment from H2a (∼42 kDa; Ref. 13.Tolchinsky S. Yuk M.H. Ayalon M. Lodish H.F. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14496-14503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This band is diffuse and seen weakly using the anti-H2 carboxyl-terminal antibody but is converted to a compact band of ∼28 kDa after treatment with N-glycanase (Fig. 4, lane 8). As with the H2a fragment, the secreted fragments from H1i5 were resistant to endo H, and had therefore been Golgi-processed (Fig. 4, lane 7). Treatment withN-glycanase converted the H1i5 fragments to a major band at ∼25 kDa and minor bands at 28–30 kDa (Fig. 4, lane 5). These sizes would correspond to most or all of the ectodomain. Coexpression of H1i5 with H2b led also to secretion of a major fragment of similar size but to a much lesser extent, which is only seen clearly after treatment with N-glycanase (Fig. 4,lane 3). Therefore, the amounts of secreted fragments produced from H1i5 upon coexpression with the H2 subunits correlate with the ability of the membrane-bound form to exit the ER and reach the cell surface. However, wild type H1, which exits the ER, does not form a secreted fragment either when singly expressed (Fig. 4,lane 11) or when coexpressed together with H2a or H2b (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 1 C, H2a is protected from degradation by the presence of H1i5 (lanes 7 and 8compared with lane 14). The amount of secreted H2a fragment in the presence of H1i5 remained the same as in its absence (data not shown). Moreover, after a 4-h chase period, we could see a Golgi-processed form of H2a, resistant to endo H (Fig.1 C, lanes 7 and 8), which is not seen when it is singly expressed (Fig. 1 C,lane 14). The extent of Golgi maturation of H2a is substantial (Fig. 5 A). Coexpression of H1i5 also led to a protection of H2b from degradation (Fig. 2 A, lane 9 compared withlane 12), although this did not translate into a higher degree of Golgi processing of H2b (Fig. 5 A). The protection of H2b precursor by the presence of H1i5 was significant (Fig. 5 A), which suggests a high degree of association between the polypeptides. This is contrary to what we could have presumed because of the low effect of H2b on H1i5 processing (Fig. 2,A, lane 8, and B). Wild type H1 allowed a higher degree of processing of H2b (Fig.5 A). In contrast, by coexpression with wild type H1 there was very little protection of H2a (Fig. 5 B, lane 7 compared with lane 9, andC). H1 did not elicit any Golgi processing of H2a either (Fig. 5 B, lane 7). Nevertheless, wild type H1 did seem to interact in some way with H2a as the coexpression allowed a higher degree of processing of H1 (Fig. 5 B,lane 6 compared with lane 8). The low effect of H1 on H2a together with the low effect of H2b on H1i5 suggests again that the presence of the EGHRG pentapeptide in both interacting subunits is crucial to mask the retention signal. Singly expressed H2a does not reach the cell surface, contrary to H2b, as seen by immunofluorescence on non-permeabilized transfectants (Fig.5 D, panels a and b) (4.Lederkremer G.Z. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1237-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Coexpression of H1i5 allowed surface expression of H2a (Fig.5 D, panel d). H2a could also reach the cell surface but to a much lesser extent when coexpressed with wild type H1 (Fig. 5 D, panel c). The surface expression of H2a in the presence of wild type H1 in double transfectants must be negligible, as it could not be detected by surface biotinylation followed by immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and blotting with streptavidin-peroxidase, a technique that had clearly revealed cell surface H1 and H2b (13.Tolchinsky S. Yuk M.H. Ayalon M. Lodish H.F. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14496-14503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On the other hand, coexpression of H1i5 did not enhance the surface expression of H2b (Fig.5 D, panel e compared withpanel b).

Singly expressed H1i5 seemed to fold at the same rate and with the same intermediates as wild type H1, as judged by their migration on non-reducing gels and the resistance to reduction byin vivo treatment with DTT (3.Shenkman M. Ayalon M. Lederkremer G.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11363-11368Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This suggested that the ER retention was not due to misfolding but to a specific effect of the presence of the retention signal EGHRG. To confirm that the association of H1i5 with H2a does not lead to a change in its folding state, which in turn allows exit from the ER, we pulsed cells with [35S]cysteine for 10 min followed by chases for several times, and then immunoprecipitation from cell lysates with anti-H1 carboxyl-terminal antibody. The immunoprecipitates were then treated with N-glycosidase F to eliminate the effect of the sugar chains on the migration and separated on non-reducing SDS-PAGE. A small shift was observed in the migration after the chase periods indicative of the folding process (Fig. 6,lanes 5 and 10). More importantly, after a 5-min incubation of the cells with 5 mm DTT, during the pulse there was a large shift to a reduced form as occurs with wild type H1 (20.Lodish H.F. Kong N. Wikstrom L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12753-12760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, incubation with DTT after the chase period had very little effect on the migration as the tightly folded molecules protect buried S-S bonds from reduction (21.Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. Nature. 1992; 356: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6, lanes 6 and 11). Moreover, the rate of folding and the bands and shifts obtained at the different times were identical when H1i5 was singly expressed or together with H2a. This result suggests that the abrogation of the effect of the H2a pentapeptide on ER retention is caused by a specific association of the subunits containing it and a steric masking of the signal and not an effect on the general folding state of the molecules. We analyzed if cells singly expressing H2a or H2b form homodimers by SDS-PAGE in non-reducing conditions followed by Western blot. Significant levels of H2b dimers could be seen only in non-reducing conditions, indicating that they are disulfide-bonded (Fig.7 A, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, there were very low, but detectable amounts of H2a dimers indicating that the extra pentapeptide affects the self-assembly (Fig. 7 A, lanes 1 and 2). To analyze directly the association of H1i5 with H2a, we used a cross-linking approach. Cells were incubatedin vivo with the membrane-permeable cross-linker DFDNB, and cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-H1 or anti-H2 antibodies followed by blot with anti-H1. Even without cross-linker, a major portion of H1i5 monomers coimmunoprecipitated with H2a (Fig.7 B, lane 3). When cross-linker was added, weak bands of dimers immunoprecipitated with anti-H2 could be observed (Fig. 7 B, lane 7), indicating an inefficient but specific cross-linking of H1i5/H2a heterodimers. No bands are seen in controls where lysates from cells expressing only H1i5 or H2a were immunoprecipitated with anti-H2 (Fig. 7 B,lanes 1, 5, and 9). Immunoprecipitation with anti-H1 showed bands corresponding to dimers in both cells expressing H1i5+H2a (Fig. 7 B, lane 6) or H1i5 alone (Fig. 7 B, lane 4). This result indicates that H1i5 is also able to self-assemble in homodimers. Nevertheless, these homodimers are not capable of exiting the ER. The main association linking H1/H2b hetero-oligomers is through α-helical coiled-coils (17.Bider M.D. Wahlberg J.M. Kammerer R.A. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31996-32001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We ran the sequences of H1i5 and H2a through a prediction program to analyze their theoretical ability to form coiled-coils. Both H1i5 and H2a retain a significant propensity for the formation of coiled-coils (Fig. 7 C) compared with H1 and H2b. Moreover, the EGHRG pentapeptide causes a small shift in the position of the coiled-coils respect to the transmembrane segment (Fig.7 C, solid line). Therefore, alignment is only obtained when both H1 and H2 species contain the pentapeptide. This can explain why only when both subunits contain the pentapeptide there is a “correct” match that masks and abrogates the retention signal. However, this masking occurs only by hetero- and not by homodimerization. Studies with many protein complexes that have the plasma membrane as a final destination seem to draw a common pathway by which assembly is required to preclude ER retention and degradation. When the subunits are expressed without their partners, they are usually retained in the ER, and in several cases degradation starts after a typical lag of about 30–60 min. This lag would allow the nascent chains to find their partners in assembly and not to be degraded immediately even if they express a determinant for degradation. In the case of the ASGPR, after this lag the H2b subunit can escape degradation by leaving the ER while H2a is cleaved and its soluble ectodomain can leave the ER. Membrane-bound H2a cannot leave the ER when singly expressed or together with the other subunits. Its role is only as a precursor of the soluble secreted form (13.Tolchinsky S. Yuk M.H. Ayalon M. Lodish H.F. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14496-14503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The insertion of the pentapeptide that differentiates H2a from H2b into the sequence of H1 caused its complete retention but not its degradation in the ER, indicating that it is a retention signal while the determinant for degradation lies elsewhere in the structure of H2a (3.Shenkman M. Ayalon M. Lederkremer G.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11363-11368Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The stability of the mutated H1 (H1i5) toward degradation resembles that of the TCR γ, ζ, and ε subunits, which, when singly expressed, are retained in the ER but are stable toward degradation (22.Bonifacino J.S. Suzuki C.K. Lippincott S.J. Weissman A.M. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Moreover, when the CD3 chains were coexpressed with TCR α and β chains, the latter were protected from degradation (6.Wileman T. Carson G.R. Concino M. Ahmed A. Terhorst C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 973-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) much in the same way as H1i5 protects H2a and H2b (Fig.5 A). As the TCR is composed of several subunits, the association of a CD3 chain with an α or β chain was not sufficient for its exit from the ER. The ASGPR is composed of only two subunits, H1 and H2, and consequently H1i5 not only stabilized H2a but also allowed its exit from the ER. Likewise, the presence of H2a allowed the exit from the ER of H1i5 (Fig. 1 C, Table I). In several cases, hetero-oligomerization is essential for exit from the ER. For example in the case of CD8 β, even if it was shown to homo-oligomerize to some extent it was retained in the ER except when coexpressed with CD8 α (23.Hennecke S. Cosson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26607-26612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the same way, singly expressed H1i5 or H2a cannot exit the ER even if H1i5 can form homodimers when singly expressed, as can H2a, although to a much lesser extent (Fig. 7) (H2a homodimers are initially formed and then degrade; Ref. 24.Ayalon-Soffer M. Kamhi-Nesher S. Lederkremer G.Z. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). H2a and H1i5 contain the charged pentapeptide retention signal, EGHRG, that is masked upon hetero-oligomerization, which could be equated to the formation of charged pairs between TCR chains (10.Cosson P. Lankford S.P. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1991; 351: 414-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the masking of the charged peptide does not occur during homo-oligomerization in cells expressing single subunits; the specific association between H1 and H2 domains is needed for the exit from the ER and for the protection of H2a from degradation. In other proteins that naturally form homo-oligomers, self-assembly can mask a retention signal leading to exit from the ER, as is the case for the secretion of acetylcholinesterase oligomers and not monomers (25.Kerem A. Kronman C. Bar N.S. Shafferman A. Velan B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 180-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the exclusive cell surface expression of dimers of lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (26.Naim H.Y. Naim H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 198-208PubMed Google Scholar). When H1i5 was coexpressed with H2b, the latter was significantly protected from degradation although its Golgi processing was not increased (Figs. 2 A and 5 A). The effect of H2b on H1i5 was minimal (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that H2b associates transiently with H1i5, being then released. A similar case was described for a recombinant β2 microglobulin that had a carboxyl-terminal KDEL retention signal added. The mutated microglobulin was stable toward degradation but retained in the ER, even though it associated with class I major histocompatibility complex and protected it from degradation and promoted assembly and export from the ER of the latter (27.Solheim J.C. Johnson N.A. Carreno B.M. Lie W.R. Hansen T.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3011-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). On the other hand, wild type H1 associates with H2b and the complex can exit the ER, leading to a more efficient Golgi processing of H2b. The significant effect of H1i5 on protecting H2b precursor from degradation also suggests a high degree of association between these subunits. Therefore, the low effect of H2b on H1i5 (Fig. 2 A, lane 8) is not due to an incapability of the polypeptides to associate; instead, it highlights the fact that assembly is not sufficient and that the EGHRG pentapeptide must be present on both subunits to allow H1i5 to efficiently exit the ER. The same is true when wild type H1 is expressed together with H2a. H1 is processed more efficiently upon coexpression, while its presence has almost no visible effect on H2a processing and survival (Fig. 5 B, Table I). This is the most intriguing finding, that the same pentapeptide signal must be present in both interacting polypeptides to cancel its own retention function. This might be accomplished by a better “match” of the coiled-coils that cause the association of the subunits when the pentapeptide is present in both of them (Fig. 7 C). The results show that the masking is specific, unlike the reported nonspecific masking of a KKXX retention signal upon assembly of high affinity IgE receptor (28.Letourneur F. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Cosson P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In that case, the steric masking of the cytoplasmic tail of the α subunit (which contains the KKXX motif) by assembly with the γ subunit allowed exit from the ER. However, the same result was obtained when the cytoplasmic tail of the γ subunit was replaced with irrelevant sequences. Association does not always lead to export from ER. It was reported that expression of an artificially ER-retained medial-Golgi enzyme,N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I resulted in the ER retention of an endogenous medial-Golgi enzyme, mannosidase II implying retention by oligomerization (29.Nilsson T. Hoe M.H. Slusarewicz P. Rabouille C. Watson R. Hunte F. Watzele G. Berger E.G. Warren G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This is opposite to what is seen in our system where an artificially ER-retained protein, H1i5, not only does not retain H2b, but when it recognizes another retained protein, H2a, it is exported from the ER by masking of the retention signal. The effect of H2a and H1i5 on each other's export from the ER seems to be by specific assembly and steric masking of the retention signal and not by an alteration of their folding (Fig. 6). However, we cannot discard the possibility that the masking of the signal is accomplished by small changes in the conformation in the region of the EGHRG pentapeptide, which is predicted to be in a β turn (4.Lederkremer G.Z. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1237-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These small conformational changes might not be detected in our folding assay. When H1i5 is coexpressed with H2a, it can be cleaved producing secreted fragments (Fig. 4). This also occurs, but to a lesser extent when it is coexpressed with H2b. Thus, H1i5 contains a cleavage site and can potentially be cleaved, but it is not when it is singly expressed. The association with H2 must expose the cleavage site. In contrast, H2a can be cleaved also when singly expressed (4.Lederkremer G.Z. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1237-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The H2a pentapeptide actually seems to hinder its association with wild type H1 so coexpression of H1 has no effect on the stability of H2a (Fig. 5) or on its cleavage and secretion. In HepG2 cells, the hindering of the association of endogenously expressed H1 and H2a might be useful in preventing interference in the formation of the membrane receptor complex, which includes H1 and H2b. In those cells the fate of H2a is rapid cleavage, probably by signal peptidase and secretion of its soluble ectodomain (13.Tolchinsky S. Yuk M.H. Ayalon M. Lodish H.F. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14496-14503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The change in the fate of H2a by coexpression with H1i5, namely its protection from degradation and routing through the Golgi to the cell surface poses a challenging implication: that, in other cases as well, ER retention could eventually be overcome by engineering an associated protein containing the same retention signal and coexpressing it. This might be especially useful in the case of ER retention and degradation of mutated proteins in genetic diseases (30.Marambaud P. Ancolio K. LopezPerez E. Checler F. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 147-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Kim P.S. Arvan P. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 173-202PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Thomas P.J. Qu B.H. Pedersen P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 456-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). It could also be used in a strategy to prevent the ER retention of viral proteins, which is necessary for the normal viral life cycle, as is the case for the hepatitis C virus glycoproteins E1 and E2 (33.Cocquerel L.

In the present study, we investigated the interaction of the chaperonins with an αβ heterodimeric intermediate during the α2β2 assembly of human mitochondrial branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase/decarboxylase (BCKD). Incubation of the recombinant His6-tagged BCKD in 400 mm KSCN for 45 min at 23 °C caused a complete dissociation of the α2β2 heterotetramers into inactive αβ heterodimers. Dilution of the denaturant resulted in a rapid recovery of BCKD independent of the chaperonins GroEL/GroES. Prolonged incubation of BCKD in 400 mm KSCN resulted in the generation of nonproductive or “bad” heterodimers, which were unable to undergo spontaneous reactivation but capable of binding to GroEL to form a stable GroEL-αβ complex. Incubation of this complex with GroES and Mg-ATP led to the slow reactivation of BCKD with a second-order rate constant k = 480m−1 s−1. Mixing experiments with radiolabeled and unlabeled protein substrates provided direct evidence that GroEL/GroES promote dissociation and subunit exchange between bad heterodimers. This was accompanied by the transformation of bad heterodimers to their “good” or productive counterparts. The good heterodimers were capable of spontaneous dimerization to initially form an inactive heterotetrameric species, followed by conversion to active heterotetramers. However, a large fraction of bad heterodimers were regenerated and rebound to GroEL. The cycle was perpetuated until the reconstitution of active BCKD was complete. Our data support the thesis that chaperonins GroEL/GroES mediate iterative annealing of nonproductive assembly intermediates at the quaternary structure level.

GroEL is a double-ring complex with two heptameric rings of identical 57-kDa subunits stacked upon one another back-to-back (3.Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Each GroEL monomer contains an apical, an intermediate, and an equatorial domain. The apical domains form a heptameric GroEL ring with a diameter of 45 Å, which facilitates the passage of unfolded or partially folded proteins. GroES is a single heptameric ring of identical 10-kDa monomers (4.Hunt J.F. Weaver A.J. Landry S.J. Gierasch L. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1996; 379: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 5.Mande S.C. Mehra V. Bloom B.R. Hol W.G.H. Science. 1996; 271: 161-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The structure of the GroEL14-ADP7-GroES7 complex confirms that binding of GroES to the apical domain of GroEL induces anen bloc domain movement, resulting in doubling the volume of the cis-ring cavity of GroEL, which allows accommodation of a polypeptide of up to 70 kDa in size (6.Roseman A.M.

Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). The mechanism of GroEL/GroES-mediated protein folding has been extensively investigated using small proteins. It has been suggested that the asymmetric GroEL/GroES complex, with only one end of GroEL capped by GroES, elicits productive protein folding (8.Langer T. Pfeifer G. Martin J. Baumeister W. Hartl F.-U. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4757-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 9.Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L.

Studies with ornithine transcarbamylase have established that the polypeptide is productively released only from the cis-ring of GroEL sequestered by GroES (9.Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O.

GroEL/GroES-mediated protein folding proceeds through multiple rounds of binding and release from GroEL until the protein attains its native conformation (2.Sigler P.B. Xu Z. Rye H.S. Burston S.G.

Nature. 1993; 366: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). It has been a subject of controversy with respect to the mechanism by which GroEL/GroES support correct protein folding. The “Anfinsen cage” model dictates that the folding of a polypeptide occurs in the protected hydrophobic environment of GroEL cavities (7.Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar, 11.Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U.

The iterative annealing mechanism is the one in which GroEL/GroES catalyzes the unfolding of misfolded polypeptides or conformers, and actual folding ensues in the bulk solution (13.Jackson G.S. Staniforth R.A. Halsall D.J. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Clarke A.R. Burston S.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2554-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 14.Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H.

A. 1996; 93: 4030-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). However, the two models are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Upon capping by GroES, the GroEL cavity lining transforms from hydrophobic to hydrophilic as the result of a 90° torque along the long axis (7.Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). This conformational change conceivably induces either folding or unfolding of polypeptides bound to the GroEL cavity. Despite the fact that the concept of GroEL/GroES as molecular chaperones originated from the discovery that they are essential for bacterial phage λ prohead assembly (17.Georgopoulos C.P. Hohn B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18.Kochan J. Murialdo H. Virology. 1983; 131: 100-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the actual role of these chaperonins in oligomeric protein assembly remains poorly understood. The current dogma is that GroEL/GroES aid in folding of nascent or unfolded polypeptides into assembly-competent monomers and that spontaneous assembly occurs in the bulk solution (19.Zheng X. Rosenberg L.E. Kalousek F. Fenton W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7489-7493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Fedorov A.V. Baldwin T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 712-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that GroEL is capable of interacting with native-like conformers. For example, GroEL was shown to facilitate a conversion of a highly structured Fab intermediate to a functional species through a process not involving unfolding (21.Lilie H. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8100-8104Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Hydrogen-deuterium exchange of small proteins barnase (22.Zahn R. Perrett S. Stenberg G. Fersht A.R.

Biol. 1997; 271: 803-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) showed that global unfolding occurs upon binding of these native conformers to GroEL. Recently, GroEL was reported to trap both dimeric and monomeric unfolding intermediates of citrate synthase induced by heat denaturation (24.Grallert H. Rutkat K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33305-33310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The interactions of GroEL with native-like conformers raise the question whether GroEL/GroES play an active role in oligomeric assembly beyond the folding of polypeptides into assembly-competent monomers. To investigate the putative role of chaperonins in protein assembly, we have used human mitochondrial branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase/decarboxylase (BCKD)1 as a model system. BCKD is a thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzyme comprising two 45.5-kDa α subunits and two 37.8-kDa β subunits. BCKD is a component of the mitochondrial BCKD complex (molecular mass, 5 × 106 kDa), which organizes around a cubic core comprising 24 dihydrolipoyl transacylase subunits, to which BCKD, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, a specific kinase, and a specific phosphatase are attached through ionic interactions (25.Reed L.J. Damuni Z. Merryfield M.L. Current Topics Cell Regul. 1985; 27: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The BCKD complex is deficient in patients with heritable maple syrup urine disease, resulting in severe acidosis and mental retardation (26.Chuang D.T. Shih V.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1239-1277Google Scholar). Mutations in the α subunit were shown to impair BCKD assembly in maple syrup urine disease patients (27.Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Chuang J.L. Cote C.D. Chuang D.T. J. Biol.

We have shown previously that co-transformation of GroEL/GroES intoEscherichia coli expressing mammalian BCKD subunits resulted in an over 500-fold increase in the yield of the active BCKD heterotetramer, compared with the single transformant without overexpression of chaperonins (28.Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12400-12403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16601-16606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we reported in vitro reconstitution of human BCKD with an absolute requirement for GroEL/GroES and Mg-ATP (30.Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.-L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 31.Huang Y.-S. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10405-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); however, the kinetics of BCKD reconstitution was markedly slower than that of chaperonin-mediated refolding of other proteins. A GroEL-αβ complex resulting from binding of a large 85-kDa αβ heterodimeric intermediate to GroEL was also isolated. Incubation of this complex with GroES and Mg-ATP led to the reconstitution of native heterotetramers. In the present study, we further characterize the interaction of GroEL/GroES with the heterodimeric intermediate. We show that GroEL/GroES promote multiple cycles of dissociation/reassociation of the heterodimers. This slow step is indispensable in priming the highly structured intermediate for subsequent heterotetrameric assembly. The recombinant His6-tagged BCKD protein was efficiently expressed in E. coli strain CG-712 (ESts) from the pHisT-hE1 plasmid by co-transformation of the pGroESL plasmid overproducing chaperonins GroEL and GroES, as described previously (28.Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12400-12403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.-L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Assembled active His6-tagged BCKD heterotetramers were isolated from cell lysates and purified on a Ni2+-NTA-derivatized Sepharose CL-6B column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), as also described previously (27.Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Chuang J.L. Cote C.D. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13110-13118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Dynamic light scattering measurements were carried out using a DP-801 DLS instrument from Protein Solutions (Charlottesville, VA) interfaced with a Mitsuba computer. Samples of BCKD (0.6 mg/ml) with or without 400 mm KSCN in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, 2% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA were filtered through a Whatman membrane of 0.45 μm pore size and manually injected into the instrument. Samples (250 μl) in the flow cell at 22 °C were illuminated with an incident beam from a 25 mW, 790 nm solid-state laser. The photons scattered by protein molecules moving in Brownian motion were collected at an angle of 90°. The distribution of diffusion coefficients derived from the autocorrelation function was determined using a method of nonnegative least squares laplacian transformation (regularization) contained in the Dynamics 4.0 software package from Protein Solutions. The hydrodynamic (Stokes) radius (R H) of the molecules was derived from the Stokes-Einstein equation (Equation 1), RH=kT/6πηDEquation 1 where η, k, and T are viscosity, the Boltzmann constant, and the absolute temperature, respectively (32.MacColl R. Halak H. Gryczynski I. Eisele L.E. Mizejewski G.J. Franklin E. Sheikh H. Montellese D. Hopkins S. MacColl L.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The corresponding molecular mass (M) was calculated according to Equation 2, RH=[(3/4π)(M/No)(νh)] 1/3Equation 2 where N o is Avogadro's number, v(0.73 cm3/g) is the partial specific volume of the protein, and h (1.3) is the hydration for soluble proteins. The frictional coefficient (f) was obtained from the Einstein-Sutherland equation (Equation 3), D=kT/fEquation 3 where D denotes the diffusion coefficient at 22 °C, with the remaining variables defined as above. A frictional coefficient for a sphere (f o) was also determined for the KSCN-induced heterodimer using Equation 4, with the variables defined as above. fo=6πη[3(M/No)ν/4π] 1/3Equation 4 Prior to the denaturation of BCKD with KSCN, it was necessary to eliminate all possible reducing equivalents. BCKD heterotetramers were precipitated with 2.5 m ammonium sulfate and resuspended in an inactivation buffer minus KSCN (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA). Following the KSCN treatment, BCKD was quickly diluted 10-fold into a spectrophotometric assay mixture consisting of 100 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm thiamine pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) as reported previously (33.Lau K.S. Cooper A.J.L. Chuang D.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1038: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Reactivation of BCKD was allowed to proceed in the assay mixture at 37 °C for various lengths of time. At different refolding times, α-ketoisovalerate (0.1 mm) was added to the incubation mixture to start the enzyme reaction. BCKD activity was monitored by decrease in absorbance at 600 nm due to the reduction of DCPIP. Data from the recovery of native BCKD activity were fitted using the enzyme kinetics program DynaFit 2.14 (34.Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar) on a Power Macintosh computer. The kinetic model used for the simulation was based on the following reaction scheme (Equation5), 2αβ →k1 [α2β2] i →k2 α2β2Equation 5 where the reaction begins with two inactive heterodimers (αβ) that upon dilution of KSCN first assemble into an inactive heterotetrameric species, [α2β2]i, followed by conversion into the active heterotetramer. The second- and first-order rate constants k 1 and k 2, respectively, were determined by plotting the recovered BCKD activity as a function of time and running multiple iterations with the DynaFit 2.14 program until the simulated curve agreed with the experimental data. Application of the test for randomness of groupings in the sequence of signs of residuals (BCKD data points (○) in Fig. 3) gave a probability of randomness of 13%. Because this is greater than the limit of significance 5%, randomness may be assumed, indicative of a good fit. His6-tagged BCKD (2 μm) was incubated with 400 mm KSCN for 45 min at 23 °C. The incubation mixture was diluted 2-fold into a potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 250 mm KCl and 1 μm GroEL. Following incubation for 1–3 h at 23 °C, the GroEL-αβ complex formed was purified by HPLC on a G3000SWXL column. The column buffer contained 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Fractions containing the GroEL-αβ complex were collected, pooled, and concentrated in a Millipore (Bedford, MA) Ultrafree-15 filter device with a 30 kDa cut-off Biomax membrane. Reconstitution of BCKD was carried out as described previously (30.Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.-L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) by incubation of 1 μm purified GroEL-αβ with 2 μm GroES and 10 mm Mg-ATP. At indicated times, aliquots were collected and assayed for BCKD activity using a radiochemical method that measured the decarboxylation rate of α-keto[1-14C]isovalerate. This assay utilized the reconstituted BCKD complex activity in the presence of excess recombinant dihydrolipoyl transacylase and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase components as described previously (30.Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.-L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The pHisT-hE1 and the pGroESL plasmids were co-transformed into ESts CG-712 cells grown at 37 °C in the C2 minimal medium as described previously (27.Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Chuang J.L. Cote C.D. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13110-13118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Following induction for expression of BCKD subunits with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 min, 7 mCi of the 35S-labeled Met/Cys mixture (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the 200 ml of the C2 medium, and induction of BCKD subunit expression was continued for 3 h. Lysates prepared from harvested cells were extracted with Ni2+-NTA resin and washed with a lysis buffer containing 15 mm imidazole (27.Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Chuang J.L. Cote C.D. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13110-13118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Proteins bound to the resin were eluted with the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Eluted35S-labeled His6-tagged α*β* heterodimers and His6-tagged α*2β*2heterotetramers were separated by FPLC on a HiLoad Superdex 200 column (2.6 × 60 cm) (30.Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.-L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Typically, the specific radioactivity of purified 35S-labeled heterodimers was between 25,000–35,000 cpm/μg protein. Nonlabeled heterodimers were prepared in a similar fashion except that no radiolabel was added to the growth media (30.Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.-L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To remove the His6 tag, 0.5–1.0 mg of35S-labeled His6-tagged α*β* heterodimers in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5.0 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol were incubated at 4 °C overnight with the recombinant tobacco-etched virus protease (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a 1:200 weight ratio of tobacco-etched virus protease:heterodimers. The tobacco-etched virus protease cleaved at a highly specific sequence (LDNLYFQ↓S) present between the His6 tag and the N terminus of the α subunit. The released His6 tag was removed by incubation of the digestion mixture with excess Ni2+-NTA resin. Following centrifugation, the supernatant containing untagged 35S-labeled heterodimers was collected. GroEL-His6-αβ and GroEL-α*β* complexes were prepared by incubation of nonlabeled His6-αβ and untagged 35S-labeled α*β*, respectively, with GroEL for 6 h at 23°. Following HPLC purification, GroEL-His6-αβ and GroEL-α*β* complexes are combined at 1:1 molar ratio (0.5 μm each) and incubated at 23 °C in the presence of 2 μm GroES and 10 mm Mg-ATP. At indicated times, aliquots of the heterodimeric intermediates released from GroEL were extracted with Ni2+-NTA resin. His6-tagged protein species bound to the Ni2+-NTA resin were eluted with 250 mmimidazole and separated on sucrose density gradients as described previously (30.Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.-L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fractions (0.7 ml) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by phosphorimaging on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA). 35S-Labeled, His6-tagged αβ heterodimers (specific radioactivity, 24,501 cpm/μg protein) were isolated as described above (final concentration, 0.36 mg/ml). The heterodimers (0.49 μm) were added to 1.2 μm GroEL in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.02% NaN3 in a final volume of 50 μl. At the indicated time, the mixture was applied to an HPLC G3000SWXLcolumn. GroEL-containing fractions were collected and radioactivity determined by scintillation counting. The k on was obtained by computer fitting using the DynaFit 2.14 program according to the scheme αβ + GroEL → GroEL-αβ. GroEL and GroES were purified as described previously (30.Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.-L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Plus protein reagent from Pierce with absorbance read at 595 nm or by direct measurement of absorbance at 280 nm. Fluorescence measurements were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer model LS50B luminescence spectrometer. We previously reported that the reconstitution of denatured human BCKD α2β2 heterotetramers proceeds through an αβ heterodimeric intermediate (30.Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.-L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It was also shown that chaperonins GroEL/GroES promote the conversion of inactive heterodimers into active heterotetramers (30.Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.-L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To further investigate this chaperonin requirement for dimerization of the heterodimeric intermediate, we used a mild chaotropic agent, KSCN, to denature His6-tagged human BCKD. The enzyme was incubated in 400 mm KSCN at 23 °C for different lengths of time. Fig.1 shows a rapid inactivation of BCKD by KSCN treatment, with enzyme activity essentially lost after 30 min of incubation. The assembly state of KSCN-treated BCKD was analyzed by FPLC gel filtration and dynamic light scattering. Fig.2 A shows that after an incubation in 400 mm KSCN for 45 min, BCKD is eluted as an 85-kDa heterodimeric species (peak 2) from an FPLC Superdex-200 column. The 1:1 heterodimeric subunit composition was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The untreated BCKD (Fig.2 A, peak 1) shows a molecular mass of 170 kDa with an elution profile clearly separated from that of the KSCN-induced heterodimers. The average Stokes radii of BCKD heterotetramers (α2β2) and KSCN-generated heterodimers (αβ) as determined by dynamic light scattering are shown in Fig.2 B. The molecular mass of BCKD heterodimers as derived from the Stokes radius, followed by normalization to known molecular markers, is 91 kDa. These size measurements established that after an incubation with 400 mm KSCN for 45 min, BCKD heterotetramers were completely dissociated into heterodimers. Additionally, the frictional coefficient (f) for the heterodimers was calculated (see under “Experimental Procedures”) using Equation 3 and compared with the frictional coefficient for a perfect sphere (f o) by using Equation 4. The frictional coefficient ratio (f/f o) (7.96 × 10−8 g cm−1 s−1/5.90 × 10−8 g cm−1 s−1) was calculated to be 1.35. This ratio suggests that the KSCN-induced heterodimers are nonspherical molecules. A hydrated sphere would have a frictional ratio of f/f o = 1.12.Figure 2Molecular mass estimation of KSCN-induced heterodimers by FPLC gel filtration and dynamic light scattering. A, elution profile of gel filtration. His6-tagged BCKD heterotetramers (7 μm) were incubated with 400 mm KSCN (in 200 μl) for 45 min at 23 °C and then applied to an SP-200 FPLC gel filtration column and eluted with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, and 200 mm KSCN. In a parallel experiment, an identical amount of untreated BCKD heterotetramers was eluted from the column with the same buffer in the absence of KSCN. The molecular masses of untreated BCKD heterotetramers (peak 1) and KSCN-induced heterodimers (peak 2) were estimated to be 170 and 85 kDa, respectively. The molecular mass markers used for calibration were as follows: cytochrome, 12.4 kDa; β-lactoglobulin, 38 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 66 kDa; and human immunoglobulin, 160 kDa. B, averaged Stokes radii of untreated BCKD heterotetramers and KSCN-induced heterodimers measured by dynamic light scattering. His6-tagged BCKD heterotetramers (3.5 μm) were incubated with 400 mm KSCN at 23 °C for 40 min. The KSCN-treated sample (250 μl) was injected into a flow cell, and dynamic light scattering was measured. The measurements with untreated BCKD (3.5 μm) were preformed similarly in the absence of KSCN. The Stokes radius was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures” using the software package Dynamic v4.0. The average Stokes radius for untreated BCKD (○) or KSCN-induced heterodimers (■) was plotted against the sampling number. The latter indicates 15 consecutive individual measurements over a time span of 7.5 min. The molecular mass markers used for calibration were as follows: bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (110 kDa), and BCKD (170 kDa). The molecular mass of the KSCN-induced heterodimer derived from its Stokes radius is 91 kDa after normalization to the known size markers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess whether the KSCN-generated heterodimers were capable of spontaneously converting into heterotetramers, refolding studies were carried out by diluting the sample by 10-fold into a BCKD assay mixture containing 0.1 mm DCPIP. BCKD activity was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 600 nm due to reduction of DCPIP. Fig. 3shows a rapid spontaneous reactivation of BCKD, upon dilution of the denaturant. The sigmoidal refolding kinetics supports the reaction scheme depicted in Equation 5. The scheme"
https://openalex.org/W2074585467,"The transcription activator TATA box-binding protein promoter-binding factor (TPBF) is both an activator and repressor of TBP gene expression in Acanthamoeba. TPBF bears little similarity to previously characterized families of factors. In order to identify domains that are involved in DNA binding, activation, and repression, we constructed several alanine linker scanning mutants and tested them for their ability to function in a variety of assays. The DNA binding domain comprises a large 100-amino acid domain within the central third of the protein, suggesting that DNA recognition is accomplished by interactions derived from several structural units within this domain. Surprisingly, transcription activation and repression are impaired by mutations within either of two discrete amino acid sequences located on either side of the DNA binding domain. These data suggest that TPBF activation and repression are accomplished by interactions with the same target. Since TATA elements can function bidirectionally, and in solution TBP can bind to TATA elements in either orientation, we propose that TPBF functions in part by orienting TBP or TFIID correctly on the TATA box."
