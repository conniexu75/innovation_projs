https://openalex.org/W1971232997,"Five of nine children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia had lymphoblasts that bound sheep erythrocytes or reacted with antiserum to thymocytes, suggesting involvement of T (thymus-derived) cells. When lymphoblasts from all patients were examined by immunofluorescence they were found to lack a marker for B (bone marrow or bursa-equivalent) cells, that is, the presence of surface immunoglobulins."

https://openalex.org/W35116158,"Abstract Carboxypeptidase Y from bakers' yeast is a diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate (DFP)-sensitive enzyme. The inactivation by [32P]DFP is accompanied by the formation of 1 mole of labeled serine per mole of enzyme. A 15-residue 32P-labeled (*) peptide has been isolated from a peptic digest and shown to have the sequence His-Ile-Ala-Gly-Glu-Ser*-Tyr-Ala-His-Gly-Tyr-Ile-Pro-Val-Phe. The reaction of the serine residue with DFP is blocked by the presence of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, which also inactivates the enzyme. The single —SH group of the protein may be near the active center of the enzyme, but the —SH group is not available to iodoacetate or iodoacetamide in the absence of denaturants. The sequence around the reactive serine residue and the properties of the —SH group contribute to an active site which is quite different from that of DFP-sensitive proteinases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, or subtilisin."

https://openalex.org/W2050976516,"beta(2)-Microglobulin (beta(2)m) is a low-molecular-weight protein constituent of lymphocyte membranes. Amino acid sequence analysis has revealed a high degree of homology between the beta(2)m and certain regions of immunoglobulin molecules, suggesting a possible recognition function for the beta(2)m, in analogy with the immunoglobulins. The data presented demonstrate that highly specific antiserum against beta(2)m blocks lymphocyte reactivity against allogeneic cells in mixed leukcocyte cultures and against phytohemagglutinin, both of which processes presumably function via a cell surface receptor on thymus-derived (T) lymphocytes. There is very little inhibition of T lymphocyte rosette formation with sheep red blood cells. The findings suggest a possible relation between the beta(2)m and recognition units on the T lymphocyte surface."

https://openalex.org/W1501106939,"Abstract Fusidic acid does not inhibit the translocation of N-acetylphenylalanyl-tRNA (N-acetyl-Phe-tRNA), bound nonenzymically to the ribosomal A-site, when the amount of ribosomes in the reaction mixture is not sufficient to trap all the available elongation factor G (EF-G) in the form of GDP ·EF-G ·fusidic acid ·ribosome complexes. Moreover, since only those ribosomes in the reaction mixture that are devoid of N-acetyl-Phe-tRNA form this complex, their strong, uncoupled EF G-dependent GTP hydrolysis is inhibited by the presence of the complex, and the GTP hydrolysis associated with translocation of the fraction of ribosomes charged with N-acetyl-Phe-tRNA can be detected. After correction for the limited hydrolysis due to the formation of the GDP·EF-G·fusidic acid·ribosome complex on the uncharged ribosomes, it is found that 1 molecule of GTP is hydrolyzed per molecule of N-acetyl-Phe-tRNA translocated."

https://openalex.org/W1584047764,"Abstract Defined di- and tripeptides were tested as acceptors in the reaction catalyzed by leucyl, phenylalanyl-tRNA-protein transferase. Criteria for acceptance were ability to inhibit the αs1-casein-dependent enzymatic transfer of 14C-amino acid from tRNA to protein and the presence in reaction mixtures of a specific peptide-dependent radioactive product. Among peptides comprising 19 different NH2-terminal residues, only those with arginine, lysine and, to a lesser extent, histidine fulfilled these criteria. Results were similar using phenylalanyl or leucyl-tRNA. Inhibition was found to be competitive with αs1-casein. When Lys-Ala-Ala was used as acceptor for phenylalanine, the product was isolated and identified as Phe-Lys-Ala-Ala. All peptides containing an NH2-terminal l-arginine or l-lysine residue were found to function as acceptors; however, d-Arg-d-Val was inactive. In each series a considerable variation in Ki values was observed, suggesting that in addition to an absolute requirement for an NH2-terminal basic amino acid, acceptor substrate specificity in this reaction is also influenced by other residues."

https://openalex.org/W2165592997,"Abstract Fructose 1,6-diphosphate, in low concentration, activates phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from Escherichia coli synergistically, with either acetyl coenzyme A or laurate. The same combinations, in high concentration, do not show this effect, but synergistically relieve aspartate inhibition. Acetyl-CoA and laurate, together, show neither effect. These findings are consistent with a changing need for the enzyme in response to metabolic conditions. Also reported are the kinetic parameters of these activators, corrected for nonactivated velocities. Maximum activations by laurate and acetyl-CoA, between pH 7.0 and 8.5, are about the same in magnitude and independent of pH. Activation by acetyl-CoA shows positive cooperativity that is quantitatively independent of pH. Laurate curves are not cooperative. Fructose 1,6-diphosphate shows positive cooperativity at pH 7.0, but not at pH 7.3 or above. Maximum activation velocity by fructose 1,6-diphosphate decreases at higher pH. Aspartate is a competitive inhibitor to each of the three activators, with positive cooperativity profiles obtained in each instance."

This is the first Pleistocene occupation site in which bone is preserved, yet found in eastern Australia."
