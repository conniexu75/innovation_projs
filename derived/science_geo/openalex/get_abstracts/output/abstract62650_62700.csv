https://openalex.org/W3022347268,"Motile Escherichia coli placed at one end of a capillary tube containing an energy source and oxygen migrate out into the tube in one or two bands, which are clearly visible to the naked eye and can also be demonstrated by photography, microscopy, and densitometry and by assaying for bacteria throughout the tube. The formation of two bands is not due to heterogeneity among the bacteria, since the bacteria in each band, when reused, will form two more bands. If an anaerobically utilizable energy source such as galactose is present in excess over the oxygen, the first band consumes all the oxygen and a part of the sugar and the second band uses the residual sugar anaerobically. On the other hand, if oxygen is present in excess over the sugar, the first band oxidizes all the sugar and leaves behind unused oxygen, and the second band uses up the residual oxygen to oxidize an endogenous energy source. The essence of the matter is that the bacteria create a gradient of oxygen or of an energy source, and then they move preferentially in the direction of the higher concentration of the chemical. As a consequence, bands of bacteria (or rings of bacteria in the case of agar plates) form and move out. These results show that E. coli is chemotactic toward oxygen and energy sources such as galactose, glucose, aspartic acid, threonine, or serine. The full repertoire of chemotactic responses by E. coli is no doubt greater than this, and a more complete list remains to be compiled. The studies reported here demonstrate that chemotaxis allows bacteria to find that environment which provides them with the greatest supply of energy. It is clearly an advantage for bacteria to be able to carry out chemotaxis, since by this means they can avoid unfavorable conditions and seek optimum surroundings. Finally, it is necessary to acknowledge the pioneering work of Englemann, Pfeffer, and the other late-19thcentury biologists who discovered chemotaxis in bacteria, and to point out that the studies reported here fully confirm the earlier reports of Beijerinck (4) and Sherris and his collaborators (5,6) on a band of bacteria chemotactic toward oxygen. By using a chemically defined medium instead of a complex broth, it has been possible to study this band more closely and to demonstrate in addition the occurrence of a second band of bacteria chemotactic toward an energy source. Beijerinck (4) did, in fact, sometimes observe a second band, but he did not offer an explanation for it."

https://openalex.org/W1564577776,"δ-Aminolevulinic acid synthesis has been demonstrated in both porphyric and normal liver homogenates. A study of the factors which affect δ-aminolevulinic acid production indicates that the enzyme δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase can be measured in liver homogenates, with use of added glycine and endogenously generated succinyl coenzyme A. δ-Aminolevulinic acid production in this system is greater than in the isolated mitochondrial system previously used. The generation of succinyl coenzyme A from endogenous substrates is close to the optimal amount for δ-aminolevulinic acid production in liver homogenates. The determinations of hepatic δ-aminolevulinic acid production in a number of normal species agree well with estimates of the δ-aminolevulinic acid required for heme enzyme synthesis. The effects of factors influencing the synthesis of aminoacetone and δ-aminolevulinic acid in liver homogenates were compared and found to be markedly different."

https://openalex.org/W1512635794,"Abstract A human Waldenstrom macroglobulin (γM) and its subunits (γMs) were subjected to tryptic hydrolysis. A fragment was isolated which was relatively stable to further tryptic attack. It had a molecular weight of ∼47,000, contained a single interchain disulfide bond, and both heavy (µ) chain and light (κ) chain antigenic determinants. After reduction, the latter were separable by Sephadex chromatography in 1 n propionic acid. A second fragment with a molecular weight of 114,000 was isolated and appeared to be a dimer consisting of two fragments, somewhat larger than the above, linked by way of the µ chain pieces by a single disulfide bond. The similarity of these fragments to those obtainable by enzymatic digestion of 7 S γ2-globulin immunoglobulins was documented, and it is suggested that they be called Fabµ and F(ab')2µ, respectively. It is proposed on the basis of these studies that human macroglobulin molecules have potentially 10 antibody combining sites."

https://openalex.org/W1527979812,"Abstract 1. The 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthetase of Bacillus subtilis has been purified 77-fold (more than 500-fold over the activity in crude extracts of wild-type strains grown in a minimal salts medium). 2. The following points support the thesis that DAHP synthetase is a single enzyme: (a) The sensitivity of the enzyme to two inhibitors is constant throughout a 77-fold purification. (b) Prephenate and chorismate independently inhibit the enzyme activity 80% at saturating inhibitor concentrations. (c) Fractionation procedures yield nonseparable DAHP synthetase activities which are similar in properties such as storage stability, thermostability, inactivation by urea or low pH, and in experimental values of kinetic constants of enzyme velocity. (d) The logic for one DAHP synthetase as the initial metabolic control point for pathway-wide regulation is consistent with efficient control by the feedback inhibitors, chorismate and prephenate. (e) Auxotrophs which are deficient for DAHP synthetase occur as single step revertible mutations. 3. Modifications in the assay for DAHP synthetase activity in B. subtilis are described. 4. Partially purified preparations of enzyme have a pH optimum of 6.5, a pH stability optimum of 6.9, and a temperature optimum of 55°. An activation energy of 9,100 cal per mole was calculated. The enzyme is activated 2-fold by low concentrations of p-chloromercuribenzoate and iodoacetate and inhibited by concentrations of 2-mercaptoethanol exceeding 10-5 M. Molecular weights of 134,000 and 129,000 were determined by gel filtration and sucrose density gradient techniques, respectively."

This is associated with changes in absorption, fluorescence emission, and fluorescence-polarization spectra, as well as in the thermal stability of the enzyme.

The dissociation constant, as determined by fluorimetric titrations, is 1.8 ± 0.5 x 10-6 m."

https://openalex.org/W1557134918,"Abstract The uptake of radioactive purines in resting cell suspensions of Bacillus subtilis has been studied. Initial rates of uptake obeyed saturation kinetics (e.g. apparent Km adenine, 0.6 µm). Subsequent uptake proceeded in steplike increments. Further studies were aimed at delineating the control mechanism for this uptake. Purines were highly concentrated with respect to the medium, but the intracellular concentration was not significantly different whether uptake had reached a plateau or was rising steeply. Over 95% of the label was present as nucleotides. A dual isotope method developed for determination of specific activities in small amounts of material suggested that the intracellular adenine pool was compartmentalized with respect to the formation of nucleotide. Uptake varied independently of nucleic acid synthesis suggesting that the magnitude of the labeled pool was not controlled directly by polymer synthesis. Evidence that the enzymes purine nucleotide pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.7, 8), which catalyze the initial reaction leading from free purine to nucleotide, may control uptake has been obtained. The relative uptake of different purines was proportional to the relative activity of this enzyme with respect to the same purines. The reaction was measured with approximately physiological substrate concentrations. A variety of specific nucleotide feedback inhibitors were shown to exist. By feedback, the level of such nucleotides would modify pyrophosphorylase activity and hence uptake. Under certain conditions, such a mechanism could lead, for example, to the steplike increments observed. The effects of a variety of inhibitors including actinomycin D and chloramphenicol on uptake were also consistent with this mechanism. The relation of this enzyme control system to other aspects of the regulation of purine nucleotide biosynthesis is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1539757478,"Abstract A polysaccharide, composed of 6-O-methyl-d-glucose and d-glucose in a molar ratio of 6:4, was isolated from the watersoluble portion of the deacylated crude lipids of Mycobacterium phlei and M. tuberculosis. The polysaccharide was purified by gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography, and borate complex formation, and was shown to have a molecular weight of about 3000 and [α]d22 +160° (c, 0.1; water). Methylation analysis of the polysaccharide showed that it has a branched structure with an average chain length of 8 to 9 hexose units. The major type of glycosidic linkage is α-(1 → 4), and the branching involves position 3 of one of the 6-O-methyl-d-glucose residues. Oligosaccharides were prepared by acetolysis of the polysaccharide, and were purified by paper chromatography. Di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, and heptasaccharides of α-(1 → 4)-linked 6-O-methyl-d-glucose, in addition to maltose and maltotriose, were isolated. The only heterooligosaccharide found was O-α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 3)-6-O-methyl-d-glucose. β-Amylase had no action on the polysaccharide, whereas α-amylase liberated about 20% of the total carbohydrate, mainly as d-glucose and maltose. Limited amylolysis yielded d-glucose, maltose, and unidentified oligosaccharides containing d-glucose. Intact lipopolysaccharide, containing 2 to 3 moles of ester-linked fatty acid, was prepared from a 70% ethanol extract of M. phlei. The lipopolysaccharide was soluble in water and in a 2:1 chloroform-methanol mixture, but was only slightly soluble in methanol or ethanol. Proton magnetic resonance and infrared and ultraviolet spectra were consistent with the results obtained by chemical analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1661889132,"Abstract Enzymological studies of the action of the inhibitors, chorismate and prephenate, upon purified preparations of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthetase in Bacillus subtilus are described for an allosteric system of feedback inhibition in aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. 1. The Ki values for chorismate and prephenate are 2.8 x 10-4 M and 4.0 x 10-5 M, respectively. 2. The following evidence is consistent with the absence of intersite interactions between substrate-binding sites: (a) the observation of first order kinetics in substrate saturation curves; (b) strictly noncompetitive inhibition; and (c) the determination of an interaction coefficient, n = 1.0, with the Hill system of coordinates. 3. Cooperative inhibitions were observed between inhibitor-binding sites. Plots of kinetic data take the form of sigmoid inhibition curves. The interaction coefficient, n', is 1.5 at inhibitor concentrations causing more than 35% inhibition of enzyme activity. Lower concentrations yield a value of 2.8 for n'. 4. Inhibition of DAHP synthetase by chorismate and prephenate is potentiated at low temperatures. This effect of temperature is correlated with the alteration of the overall dissociation constant, K. The cooperative interactions between substrate-binding sites are independent of temperature as judged by measurements of interaction coefficients at different temperatures. 5. Monomer-polymer protein interactions probably do not play a major role in the feedback inhibition of DAHP synthetase by intermediary metabolites in aromatic amino acid synthesis since the sedimentation pattern of the enzyme is unchanged in the presence of inhibitors. 6. DAHP synthetase is activated by p-chloromercuribenzoate and iodoacetate and these compounds potentiate the inhibition of the enzyme. In contrast, 2-mercaptoethanol inhibits DAHP synthetase and partially desensitizes the enzyme to inhibitor effects. 7. DAHP synthetase is partially desensitized with mercuric acetate. Heat treatment and exposure to urea have no effect upon inhibition of remaining enzyme activity. Total desensitization is never observed. Neither the feedback effectors nor the aromatic amino acids protected the enzyme from a number of inactivating agents."
https://openalex.org/W1537172236,"The extent to which the intracellular lipids of monkey gastrocnemius and soleus muscles are used as a fuel for contractile activity in postabsorptive state was investigated. Under conditions in vivo, one set of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles was caused to undergo vigorous contractile activity for 5 hours while the contralateral muscles served as quiescent controls. The concentration of the various classes of phospholipids and triglyceride in the skeletal muscle was not affected by contractile activity. The significance of this finding is discussed. The conclusion is drawn that intracellular muscle lipids are not used as a net source of fuel for the increased energy metabolism of contracting muscle even after prolonged periods of fasting. It is further concluded that the lipid fuel used by skeletal muscle during contractile activity is derived entirely from sources outside the muscle cell. The question of the effect of muscle activity on the turnover of muscle lipid esters was also studied by means of isotopic tracer techniques. The data provide no evidence that the rate of turnover is increased during muscular activity, and the conclusion is tentatively drawn that the rate of turnover of skeletal muscle lipids is not influenced by contractile activity."
https://openalex.org/W1603972301,"Abstract The starch granule-bound adenosine diphosphate glucose-starch glucosyltransferase isolated from the embryos of normal (nonwaxy) maize seeds is different from a similar preparation isolated from the endosperms. For the embryo preparation, the ratio of the activity with ADP-glucose to the activity with uridine diphosphate glucose is 15 at a low substrate concentration and 48 at a high concentration in the absence of K+; the pH optima are 7.0 to 7.5 in Tris-HCl buffer and 8.0 to 8.5 in a glycylglycine buffer; it is inhibited slightly by ethylenediaminetetraacetate; it is almost completely inactivated by a 30-min incubation at 60°; and the Km for ADP-glucose is 1.25 x 10-2 m. For the endosperm preparation the ratio of the activity with ADP-glucose to the activity with UDP-glucose is less than 2 in the absence of K+; the pH optimum is 7.5 in both Tris-HCl and glycylglycine buffers; it is stimulated slightly by EDTA; it is less affected by preincubation at 60° than the embryo preparation and is completely protected by EDTA plus KCl from inactivation at 60° for 30 min; the Km (ADP-glucose) is 2.5 x 10-3 m. It is suggested that these two ADP-glucose-starch glucosyltransferases are different enzyme systems. This is compatible with the observation that in the waxy mutants of maize, the activity of the endosperm preparation of all mutants examined is reduced to a very low level, but the activity of the embryo preparation is unimpaired."

https://openalex.org/W1560731026,"Abstract The hydrolysis of lysyl-, arginyl-, leucyl-, methionyl-, and phenylalanyl-p-nitroanilides by bovine anterior pituitary glands is attributable to the action of at least two distinct enzymes, designated as lysyl and arginyl arylamidases because of their preferential action on the respective p-nitroanilides. The arginyl arylamidase is associated with a dipeptidase during fractionation with (NH4)2SO4 and chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose. The purified arylamidase is principally active upon Arg- and, to a somewhat lesser extent, on Lys-p-nitroanilide; it hydrolyzes other p-nitroanilides at a very low rate. The lysyl arylamidase is distinguishable from the arginyl arylamidase by its requirement for thiol compounds for activation and by a strong sensitivity to puromycin. Although Lys-p-nitroanilide is hydrolyzed preferentially, a significant rate of hydrolysis also is seen with Arg-, Phe-, Met-, and Leu-p-nitroanilide. Purified lysyl arylamidase preparations completely hydrolyze Ala5, Ala4, Ala3, Ala2, Lys4, Lys3, and Lys2 to the free amino acids, but only the hydrolysis of Ala5,, Ala4, and Lys4 is subject to a consistent and substantial activation by mercaptoethanol and inhibition by puromycin. The total hydrolysis of the tetra- and pentapeptides is ascribed to the consecutive action of an aminopolypeptidase, a tripeptidase, and a dipeptidase. Since the aminopolypeptidase is associated with the lysyl arylamidase during purification and displays the same properties as the latter, both activities are assumed to be due to the action of a single enzyme. Both arylamidases require thiol groups and a metal for activity and are strongly inhibited by dipeptides, tripeptides, polylysine, polyarginine, protamine, and the arginine-rich calf thymus histones. The subcellular distribution, the effect of various inhibitors, and the stability of the arylamidases are noted."
https://openalex.org/W1575594004,"Abstract Unfractionated extracts of an amethopterin-resistant mutant of Streptococcus faecalis contained from 10 to 100 times more dihydrofolate reductase activity than the wild strain (ATCC 8043). Extracts of the mutant strain also contained significant folate reductase, but this was not detectable in wild strain extracts. Dihydrofolate reductase has been purified 100 to 500 times from the mutant extracts and 200 to 700 times from extracts of the wild strain by a procedure involving repeated gel filtration and ammonium sulfate precipitation. The procedure also results in about 70-fold purification of folate reductase from the mutant. The purified preparation from the mutant has dihydrofolate reductase specific activity greater than that calculated for the pure enzyme obtained from mammalian sources but has about the same molecular weight (approximately 21,000) as the latter; the turnover number of the bacterial enzyme is therefore higher than that of the mammalian enzyme. Evidence is presented that more than one species of dihydrofolate reductase is present in the purified preparation from the mutant, and the significance of this multiplicity of enzyme species is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1561462602,"Abstract 6-(p-Hydroxyphenylazo)-2,4-dihydroxypyrimidine, a microbial inhibitor with selective toxicity for gram-positive bacteria, is bactericidal for growing cultures of Streptococcus fecalis at concentrations greater than 1.0 µM. This phenylazopyrimidine specifically and completely inhibits the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid and has no apparent effects on major areas of intermediary metabolism or on the gross synthesis of lipid, ribonucleic acid, protein, and cell wall material. The inhibition of synthesis of DNA is not associated with an increased degradation of the DNA in cells to acid-soluble forms, and is completely reversed by removal of the drug from inhibited cultures. Since neither the formation of the essential deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate precursors of DNA nor the processes responsible for initiation of synthesis of DNA are inhibited, the primary locus of action is believed to be the polymerization reaction that results in the formation of DNA."

The isolated spore and vegetative cell enzymes are equally heat-labile, whereas inside the spore the polymerase is far more heat-stable than within the vegetative cell. The bulk of polymerase activity disappears during sporulation, and only about 30% is recovered in the spores. It is inferred that there is loss or destruction of the residual polymerase. Whether polymerase molecules are newly synthesized for the spore or simply a legacy from the vegetative cell population remains to be determined."

https://openalex.org/W1485368386,"Abstract The deiodination of labeled l-thyroxine and l-triiodothyronine (T3) in the presence of flavin mononucleotide, light, oxygen, and phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, was followed by measuring the iodide released. Under standardized conditions the amount of deiodination was found to be proportional to light intensity. At any T3 concentration, the reaction is first order with respect to T3, whereas FMN acts catalytically. No evidence was found for the existence of an FMN-l-thyroxine or FMN-iodine complex. The reaction velocity of the deiodination of T3 was found to be proportional to the concentrations of FMN and T3 up to a concentration of FMN of 2 x 10-5 m. The activation energy for the deiodination of l-thyroxine is 8900 cal. Iodide and increasing ionic strength inhibited the reaction. Amino acids, amines, proteins, and some metal chelators were found to accelerate the FMN-induced deiodination. The stimulatory effect of aliphatic amino acids, ribonuclease, and ethylenediaminetetraacetate disappeared when the system was made metal-free by means of Dowex A-1 and by extraction with dithizone in heptane. Fe2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Ca2+, in concentrations of 5 x 10-8 m, added to the purified system restored the stimulatory activity of these agents. Different metal ions and different concentrations were found necessary for optimal effects depending on the amino acid or proteins employed. Fe2+ plus EDTA, on the other hand, was inhibitory at concentrations where Fe2+ and EDTA alone did not influence deiodination. Cupferron, quinoline-8-carboxylic acid, and 8-hydroxyquinoline inhibited deiodination in the ordinary system. Tryptophan, histidine, and tyrosine showed no metal requirement. The accelerated deiodination of l-thyroxine by aliphatic amino acid and proteins, as well as inhibited deiodination by chelators plus metal ions, is considered to be due to chelation with bivalent metal ions."

The separation of the two albumins was excellent on a cellulose acetate strip (Fig. 2) and shows, without any doubt, that the anomalous albumin is the slower one. But free electrophoresis using a Perkin–Elmer apparatus disclosed only a weak ‘shoulder’ on the cathodic side of the albumin band (Fig. 3). Immunoelectrophoresis and the Ouchterlony test using anti-human serum, or specific anti-human albumin serum, did not show any difference between the two albumins (Fig. 4).

https://openalex.org/W1490309400,"Abstract The sensitivity of xanthosine 5'-phosphate aminase to the inhibitory effect of the antibiotic psicofuranine can be reduced by exposure to several kinds of agents capable of modifying protein structure. These include urea and ethylene glycol, reducing agents such as 2-mercaptoethanol, the chelators ethylenediaminetetraacetate and o-phenanthroline, and photo-oxidation with methylene blue. Urea, in causing a 3-fold reduction in the capacity of the aminase to bind psicofuranine and a similar reduction in sensitivity to inhibition by the aminase, also affects other properties of the aminase; the affinity constants for Mg++, NH3, adenosine triphosphate, and xanthosine 5'-phosphate are increased while the activity of the aminase is greatly reduced. 2-Mercaptoethanol reduces the sensitivity of the aminase to inhibition by psicofuranine, but reduces neither its activity nor its ability to bind psicofuranine. In contrast photo-oxidation with methylene blue desensitizes by selectively reducing the ability of the aminase to bind psicofuranine; the substrate-binding capacities of the aminase are not affected by the photo-oxidation. Psicofuranine increases the availability of sulfhydryl groups of the aminase for reaction with sulfhydryl reagents. This indication of a change in the tertiary structure of the aminase together with the additional evidence that the aminase contains a separate binding site for psicofuranine suggests that although the antibiotic is probably bound at a nonessential part of the enzyme it nevertheless may act by distorting the active center."

https://openalex.org/W1540702725,"Abstract To determine whether enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of dipeptides are located at or near the surface of Escherichia coli strain K-12, the bacteria were converted to Spheroplasts by treatment with ethylenediaminetetraacetate and lysozyme, and the enzymic activity of the medium surrounding the spheroplasts and of the spheroplast lysate was compared with the activity of a total cell lysate. The substrates were glycyl-L-leucine, glycyl-L-phenylalanine, L-leucylglycine, and L-phenylalanylglycine. Under a variety of experimental conditions, peptidase assays showed that essentially all the peptidase activity of lysed cells is retained within the spheroplasts; the relative amount of enzymic activity toward each dipeptide that is released into the surrounding medium as a result of spheroplast formation is almost identical with the extent of β-galactosidase leakage. A significant portion of the peptidase activity shown by cell lysates exists in a latent condition in intact cells, which show low, but equal, specific activity toward all the peptides. In contrast, cell lysates and sonic extracts and spheroplast lysates exhibit markedly different hydrolytic activity toward the four substrates. A variation in specific activity toward the substrates also is evident after treatment of intact cells with toluene, but toluene treatment permits the expression of only a portion of the activity that is latent in the intact cells and is evident in cell lysates or spheroplast lysates. The activity characteristic of each type of bacterial preparation under a specific set of assay conditions is approximately the same for preparations made from cells harvested from cultures during exponential growth or shortly after the attainment of maximal growth. However, the specific activity of a given bacterial preparation to a given peptide varies depending on the concentration of EDTA and of Mn2+ in the assay mixture. When the concentrations of these substances are varied, it is possible to distinguish readily between enzymes that act on leucylglycine, on phenylalanylglycine, and on the two dipeptides with an amino-terminal glycine residue."

The inhibitory activity of the phospholipid was lost by enzymic cleavage of the β-acyl fatty acid moiety or by hydrolysis of the bases associated with the phosphatidyl group. Diglycerides derived from the lipid retained significant inhibitory properties.

Recently we pointed out that this enzyme is located at the apical pole of the cells of the tubular glands3 (Fig. 1). We succeeded in demonstrating, by a histochemical method4, that the reactivity of carbonic anhydrase is reduced in the uterus gland cells in moulting hens, whereas moulting has no influence on the carbonic anhydrase activity in the erythrocytes (Fig. 2). These results suggest an enzyme activation or an induction of enzyme synthesis similar to the effect of progesterone on the carbonic anhydrase in the endometrium of mammals5,6."
https://openalex.org/W197231762,Abstract The immunochemical properties of chromatographically prepared human erythrocuprein differ from those of the chloroform-ethanol-treated protein. Losses of copper also appear to modify its immunochemical reactivity. The result of the immunochemical reactions of rabbit antibody to human erythrocuprein with human liver and brain extracts suggests a common antigen in the two tissues. Human erythrocyte catalase is not immunochemically identical with human liver catalase. Rabbit antisera to erythrocyte catalase fail to precipitate with hemolysates from some higher primates but give a cross-reaction with lysates from the cat and pig. Human erythrocuprein antisera give a cross-reaction only with hemolysate from the higher primates.

First of all, it was surprising that mycobacteria contain lipids up to 35 per cent of their dry weight2. This fact did not escape the notice of immunologists. It seemed highly improbable that this fraction of the mycobacteriae should not contain antigens or—more likely—haptens. Since alcohol-soluble lipids form stable aqueous suspensions, they can be examined relatively easily. However, the majority of mycobacterial lipids consists of waxes which form no stable aqueous suspensions and usually exhibit an anti-complementary action. By means of a newly developed microprecipitin technique3 it became possible to investigate all kinds of lipids, independently from their solubility in organic solvents."

The method has always proved a source of difficulty and has led to much confusion as to the taxonomic position of cultures. This point was well illustrated by Dye2, who produced micrographs of cells of a culture of Xanthomonas trifolii in which polar or lateral monotrichous and peritrichous flagellation could all be demonstrated."
