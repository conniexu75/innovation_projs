https://openalex.org/W1970538973,"A two-state, four-orbital, independent electron analysis of the first optical molecular hyperpolarizability, beta, leads to the prediction that |beta| maximizes at a combination of donor and acceptor strengths for a given conjugated bridge. Molecular design strategies that focus on the energetic manipulations of the bridge states are proposed for the optimization of beta. The limitations of molecular classes based on common bridge structures are highlighted and more promising candidates are described. Experimental results supporting the validity of this approach are presented."

Many of the problems researchers have in defining the pathways, enzymes, and genes involved in plant lipid metabolism appear to be amenable to analysis by genetic approaches. Mutants with alterations in membrane lipid composition have also been used to study the structural and adaptive roles of lipids. The application of genetic engineering methods affords opportunities for researchers to apply knowledge gained about plant lipid metabolism toward enhanced use of plant oils as abundant and renewable sources of reduced carbon."
https://openalex.org/W2039411624,"For more than 50 years, observations of earthquakes to depths of 100 to 650 kilometers inside Earth have been enigmatic: at these depths, rocks are expected to deform by ductile flow rather than brittle fracturing or frictional sliding on fault surfaces. Laboratory experiments and detailed calculations of the pressures and temperatures in seismically active subduction zones indicate that this deep-focus seismicity could originate from dehydration and high-pressure structural instabilities occurring in the hydrated part of the lithosphere that sinks into the upper mantle. Thus, seismologists may be mapping the recirculation of water from the oceans back into the deep interior of our planet."
https://openalex.org/W2031603865,"The concept of hidden Fermi surface nesting was introduced to explain the general observation that certain low-dimensional metals with several partially filled bands exhibit charge density wave (CDW) instabilities, although their individual Fermi surfaces do not reveal the observed nesting vectors. This concept was explored by considering the Fermi surfaces of the purple bronze AMo6O17 (A = sodium or potassium) and then observing the CDW spatial fluctuations expected from its hidden nesting on the basis of diffuse x-ray scattering experiments. The concept of hidden Fermi surface nesting is essential for understanding the electronic instabilities of low-dimensional metals."
https://openalex.org/W2011748145,"Theories of intelligence, and some of the research testing them, are designed to answer three basic questions about intelligence: (i) What is the relation of intelligence to the internal world of the individual? (ii) What is the relation of intelligence to the external world of the individual? (iii) What is the relation of intelligence to experience? Various models of the mind underlying the theories have been proposed; the strengths and limitations of these models are assessed. A theory that addresses all three questions simultaneously is the triarchic theory."
https://openalex.org/W1994115799,Power input increased linearly with speed and was closely associated with changes in cycle frequency. Minimum cost of transport of gypsy moth caterpillars was 4.5 times as high as predicted for vertebrates and arthropods with jointed framework skeletons. Reduced locomotor economy was associated with stride length only one-third or less than that for animals with solid skeletons.

These experiments play an important role in deciding which of the myriad theoretical models correctly describes violations of the principle of time-reversal invariance."
https://openalex.org/W2018340291,"The carbon in ancient carbonaceous chondritic meteorites is mainly in a hydrocarbon composite similar to terrestrial kerogen, a cross-linked structure of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Until recently, the composite has been commonly thought to have been produced in the early solar nebula by a Fischer-Tropsch-type process, involving the catalytic synthesis of hydrocarbons from carbon monoxide and hydrogen on grain surfaces. Instead, the aromatic hydrocarbons may form in gas-phase pyrolysis of simple aliphatics like acetylene and methane by a mechanism developed recently to explain formation of soot in combustion and of aromatic molecules in circumstellar envelopes. Nonequilibrium chemical kinetic calculations indicate that this mechanism can produce meteoritic aromatics if the initial concentration of simple hydrocarbons in the solar nebula was sufficiently but not unreasonably high."
https://openalex.org/W2016489457,"Acarodomatia or ""mite houses"" are located on leaves of many present-day angiosperms and are inhabited by mites that may maintain leaf hygiene. Eocene deposits in southern Australia have yielded acarodomatia on fossil leaves of Elaeocarpaceae and Lauraceae and also contain oribatid mites with close affinities to those that inhabit the acarodomatia of the closest living relatives of the fossil plant taxa. The data indicate that mite-plant associations may have been widespread in southern Australia 40 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W1969191348,Geodetic measurements of deformation in northwestern Washington indicate that strain is accumulating at a rate close to that predicted by a model of the Cascadia subduction zone in which the plate interface underlying the continental slope and outer continental shelf is currently locked but the remainder of the interface slips continuously. Presumably this locked segment will eventually rupture in a great thrust earthquake with a down-dip extent greater than 100 kilometers.

https://openalex.org/W1967242360,"In this article estimates are made of the permanent and reversible components of changes in heating oil use in major countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The components of the increase in oil use through the mid-1970's, and of the subsequent decline, are revealed. For seven countries, residential oil use decreased by 40 percent between 1972 and 1983, for a savings of about 1.2 million barrels per day (59 million metric tons of oil equivalent per year). One-third of this resulted from reductions in the number of homes heated with oil, the rest from reductions in oil use per oil-heated home. During that time, however, the size of these homes and the penetration of central heating increased significantly, so these figures underestimate the actual conservation achieved. Of the total oil savings, at least 46 percent are of a permanent nature, while the rest could be reversed with a continued slide in oil prices, although it seems likely that most of the savings will be maintained and may even increase."
