https://openalex.org/W2775514330,"A structural look at α-synuclein oligomers Fibrillar aggregates of the protein α-synuclein (αS) are the major constituents of Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease. However, small oligomers that accumulate during the process of fibril formation are thought to cause the neuronal toxicity associated with the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease. Little is known about the detailed structural properties of αS oligomers and the molecular mechanisms that lead to their toxicity. Fusco et al. report the structural characterization of two forms of αS oligomers, which elucidates the fundamental structural elements giving rise to neuronal toxicity. Science , this issue p. 1440"

This makes them good therapeutic leads, but screening libraries only cover a fraction of the sequence space available to peptides comprising D and L amino acids. Hosseinzadeh et al. achieved near-complete coverage in sampling the sequence space for 7- to 10-residue cyclic peptides and identified more than 200 designs predicted to fold into stable structures. Of 12 structures determined, nine were close to the computational models. They also sampled and designed 11- to 14-residue macrocycles, but without complete coverage. The designed macrocycles provide a path forward for engineering new therapeutics. Science , this issue p. 1461"
https://openalex.org/W2771755426,"Predicting wildfire under future conditions is complicated by complex interrelated drivers operating across large spatial scales. Annual area burned (AAB) is a useful index of global wildfire activity. Current and antecedent seasonal climatic conditions, and the timing of snowpack melt, have been suggested as important drivers of AAB. As climate warms, seasonal climate and snowpack co-vary in intricate ways, influencing fire at continental and sub-continental scales. We used independent records of seasonal climate and snow cover duration (last date of permanent snowpack, LDPS) and cell-based Structural Equation Models (SEM) to separate direct (climatic) and indirect (snow cover) effects on relative changes in AAB under future climatic scenarios across western and boreal North America. To isolate seasonal climate variables with the greatest effect on AAB, we ran multiple regression models of log-transformed AAB on seasonal climate variables and LDPS. We used the results of multiple regressions to project future AAB using GCM ensemble climate variables and LDPS, and validated model predictions with recent AAB trends. Direct influences of spring and winter temperatures on AAB are larger and more widespread than the indirect effect mediated by changes in LDPS in most areas. Despite significant warming trends and reductions in snow cover duration, projected responses of AAB to early-mid 21st century are heterogeneous across the continent. Changes in AAB range from strongly increasing (one order of magnitude increases in AAB) to moderately decreasing (more than halving of baseline AAB). Annual wildfire area burned in coming decades is likely to be highly geographically heterogeneous, reflecting interacting regional and seasonal climate drivers of fire occurrence and spread."
https://openalex.org/W2775154594,"The non-pathogenic parvovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), is an efficient vector for transgene expression in vivo and shows promise for treatment of brain disorders in clinical trials. Currently, there are more than 100 AAV serotypes identified that differ in the binding capacity of capsid proteins to specific cell surface receptors that can transduce different cell types and brain regions in the CNS. In the current study, multiple AAV serotypes expressing a GFP reporter (AAV1, AAV2/1, AAVDJ, AAV8, AAVDJ8, AAV9, AAVDJ9) were screened for their infectivity in both primary murine astrocyte and neuronal cell cultures. AAV2/1, AAVDJ8 and AAV9 were selected for further investigation of their tropism throughout different brain regions and cell types. Each AAV was administered to P0-neonatal mice via intracerebroventricular injections (ICV). Brains were then systematically analyzed for GFP expression at 3 or 6 weeks post-infection in various regions, including the olfactory bulb, striatum, cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra (SN) and cerebellum. Cell counting data revealed that AAV2/1 infections were more prevalent in the cortical layers but penetrated to the midbrain less than AAVDJ8 and AAV9. Additionally, there were differences in the persistence of viral transgene expression amongst the three serotypes examined in vivo at 3 and 6 weeks post-infection. Because AAV-mediated transgene expression is of interest in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s Disease, we examined the SN with microscopy techniques, such as CLARITY tissue transmutation, to identify AAV serotypes that resulted in optimal transgene expression in either astrocytes or dopaminergic neurons. AAVDJ8 displayed more tropism in astrocytes compared to AAV9 in the SN region. We conclude that ICV injection results in lasting expression of virally encoded transgene when using AAV vectors and that specific AAV serotypes are required to selectively deliver transgenes of interest to different brain regions in both astrocytes and neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2772780441,"This work is the first to take advantage of recurrent neural networks to predict influenza-like illness (ILI) dynamics from various linguistic signals extracted from social media data. Unlike other approaches that rely on timeseries analysis of historical ILI data and the state-of-the-art machine learning models, we build and evaluate the predictive power of neural network architectures based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs) units capable of nowcasting (predicting in “real-time”) and forecasting (predicting the future) ILI dynamics in the 2011 – 2014 influenza seasons. To build our models we integrate information people post in social media e.g., topics, embeddings, word ngrams, stylistic patterns, and communication behavior using hashtags and mentions. We then quantitatively evaluate the predictive power of different social media signals and contrast the performance of the-state-of-the-art regression models with neural networks using a diverse set of evaluation metrics. Finally, we combine ILI and social media signals to build a joint neural network model for ILI dynamics prediction. Unlike the majority of the existing work, we specifically focus on developing models for local rather than national ILI surveillance, specifically for military rather than general populations in 26 U.S. and six international locations., and analyze how model performance depends on the amount of social media data available per location. Our approach demonstrates several advantages: (a) Neural network architectures that rely on LSTM units trained on social media data yield the best performance compared to previously used regression models. (b) Previously under-explored language and communication behavior features are more predictive of ILI dynamics than stylistic and topic signals expressed in social media. (c) Neural network models learned exclusively from social media signals yield comparable or better performance to the models learned from ILI historical data, thus, signals from social media can be potentially used to accurately forecast ILI dynamics for the regions where ILI historical data is not available. (d) Neural network models learned from combined ILI and social media signals significantly outperform models that rely solely on ILI historical data, which adds to a great potential of alternative public sources for ILI dynamics prediction. (e) Location-specific models outperform previously used location-independent models e.g., U.S. only. (f) Prediction results significantly vary across geolocations depending on the amount of social media data available and ILI activity patterns. (g) Model performance improves with more tweets available per geo-location e.g., the error gets lower and the Pearson score gets higher for locations with more tweets."

https://openalex.org/W2774428646,"Background The number of older cancer patients is rising. Especially in older people, treatment considerations should balance the impact of disease and treatment on quality of life (QOL) and survival. How a cancer diagnosis in older people interacts with concomitant frailty to impact on QOL is largely unknown. We aimed to determine the association between frailty and QOL among community-dwelling older people aged 65 years or above with and without a cancer diagnosis cross-sectionally and at 12 months follow-up. Methods Data were derived from the TOPICS-MDS database. Frailty was quantified by a frailty index (FI). QOL was measured with the subjective Cantril’s Self Anchoring Ladder (CSAL, range: 0–10) and the health-related EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D, range:-0.33–1.00) at baseline and after 12 months. To determine associations, linear mixed models were used. Results 7493 older people (78.6±6.4 years, 58.4% female) were included. Dealing with a cancer diagnosis (n = 751) was associated with worse QOL both at baseline (CSAL:-0.25 (95%-CI:-0.36;-0.14), EQ-5D:-0.03 (95%-CI:-0.05;-0.02)) and at follow-up (CSAL:-0.13 (95%-CI:-0.24;-0.02), EQ-5D:-0.02 (95%-CI:-0.03;-0.00)). A ten percent increase in frailty was also associated with a decrease in QOL at baseline (CSAL:-0.35 (95%-CI:-0.38;-0.32), EQ-5D:-0.12 (95%-CI:-0.12;-0.11)) and follow-up (CSAL:-0.27 (95%-CI:-0.30;-0.24), EQ-5D:-0.07 (95%-CI:-0.07;-0.06)). When mutually adjusting for frailty and a cancer diagnosis, associations between a cancer diagnosis and QOL only remained significant for CSAL at baseline (-0.14 (95%-CI:-0.25;-0.03)), whereas associations between frailty and QOL remained significant for all QOL outcomes at baseline and follow-up. No statistical interactions between cancer and frailty in their combined impact on QOL were found. Conclusions Cancer diagnosis and frailty were associated with worse health-related and self-perceived QOL both at baseline and at follow-up. Differences in QOL between older people with and without a cancer diagnosis were explained to a large extent by differences in frailty levels. This stresses the importance to take into account frailty in routine oncologic care."
https://openalex.org/W2773136537,"Severe malaria Even with the best available treatment, the mortality from severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria remains high. Typical features at death are high parasite loads and obstructed micro- vasculature. Infected erythrocytes (IE) containing mature parasites bind to the host receptor heparan sulfate, which is also an important receptor for merozoite invasion. To block merozoite invasion has not previously been proposed as an adjunctive therapeutic approach but it may preclude the early expansion of an infection that else leads to exacerbated sequestration and death. Sevuparin in phase I study The drug sevuparin was developed from heparin because heparan sulfate and heparin are nearly identical, so the rationale was that sevuparin would act as a decoy receptor during malaria infection. A phase I study was performed in healthy male volunteers and sevuparin was found safe and well tolerated. Sevuparin in phase I/II clinical study A phase I/II clinical study was performed in which sevuparin was administered via short intravenous infusions to malaria patients with uncomplicated malaria who were also receiving atovaquone/proguanil treatment. This was a Phase I/II, randomized, open label, active control, parallel assignment study. Sevuparin was safe and well tolerated in the malaria patients. The mean relative numbers of ring-stage IEs decreased after a single sevuparin infusion and mature parasite IEs appeared transiently in the circulation. The effects observed on numbers of merozoites and throphozoites in the circulation, were detected already one hour after the first sevuparin injection. Here we report the development of a candidate drug named sevuparin that both blocks merozoite invasion and transiently de-sequesters IE in humans with P. falciparum malaria.

https://openalex.org/W2771577341,"The objective of the study was to synthesis silica nanoparticles modified with (i) a tertiary amine bearing two t-cinnamaldehyde substituents or (ii) dimethyl-octyl ammonium, alongside the well-studied quaternary ammonium polyethyleneimine nanoparticles. These were to be evaluated for their chemical and mechanical properties, as well for antibacterial and antibiofilm activity. Samples were incorporated in commercial dental resin material and the degree of monomer conversion, mechanical strength, and water contact angle were tested to characterize the effect of the nanoparticles on resin material. Antibacterial activity was evaluated with the direct contact test and the biofilm inhibition test against Streptococcus mutans. Addition of cinnamaldehyde-modified particles preserved the degree of conversion and compressive strength of the base material and increased surface hydrophobicity. Quaternary ammonium functional groups led to a decrease in the degree of conversion and to low compressive strength, without altering the hydrophilic nature of the base material. In the direct contact test and the anti-biofilm test, the polyethyleneimine particles exhibited the strongest antibacterial effect. The cinnamaldehyde-modified particles displayed antibiofilm activity, silica particles with quaternary ammonium were ineffective. Immobilization of t-cinnamaldehyde onto a solid surface via amine linkers provided a better alternative to the well-known quaternary ammonium bactericides."
https://openalex.org/W2771821717,"Insects are investigated as alternative protein source to meet the increasing demand for proteins in the future. Enzymatic browning occurring during grinding of insect and subsequent extraction of proteins can influence the proteins’ properties, but it is unclear which enzymes are responsible for this phenomenon. This study was performed on larvae of three commonly used insect species, namely Tenebrio molitor, Alphitobius diaperinus and Hermetia illucens. Oxygen consumption measurements on protein extracts showed activity on L-tyrosine, L-3,4-di-hydroxy-phenylalanine (L-DOPA) and L-dopamine, indicating phenoloxidase as a key player in browning. Furthermore, no reaction on 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) was observed, ruling out an important contribution of laccase to browning. The browning reaction was most prominent at pH 6 for T. molitor and A. diaperinus, and 7 for H. illucens. As the enzyme activity of H. illucens was the lowest with the darkest color formation, this was likely caused by another factor. The activity of phenoloxidase was confirmed for T. molitor and A. diaperinus by activity measurements after fractionation by anion-exchange chromatography. Color measurements showed the presence of activity on both L-DOPA and L-tyrosine in the same fractions. Both substrates were converted into dopachrome after incubation with enzyme-enriched fractions. No DOPA-decarboxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase and peroxidase activities were observed. By using native PAGE with L-DOPA as staining-solution, active T. molitor protein bands were resolved and characterized, identifying a tyrosinase/phenoloxidase as the active enzyme species. All together, these data confirmed that tyrosinase is an important enzyme in causing enzymatic browning in T. molitor and likely in A. diaperinus."
https://openalex.org/W2772237462,"Background Both motor and non-motor symptoms could contribute to significant deterioration of psychological well-being in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, its assessment has been only indirectly evaluated using tools based on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), such as the PDQ-39 scale. Objectives To evaluate psychological well-being in PD using a specific tool of assessment, the Psychological Well-being Scale (PWS), and its clinical correlates. Methods This article reports data of patients’ perception of health state, as measured by means of the PWS, from an epidemiological, cross-sectional study conducted in Italian PD patients (FORTE Study). We tested possible relationship between well-being and clinical characteristics including fatigue, depression, sleep disruption and HRQoL. Results 272 patients completed the PWS questionnaire. Significant and clinically-relevant correlations were found between PWS total score and Parkinson’s Fatigue Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, UPDRS Section I, PD Sleep Scale and PDQ-39 for HRQoL scores. Only clinically negligible correlations were found between PWS and motor scores. Conclusions Non-motor symptoms have a significant impact on psychological well-being in PD patients."

https://openalex.org/W2773313331,"Background Exercise is effective in improving non-specific low back pain (LBP). Certain components of physical exercise, such as the type, intensity and frequency of exercise, are likely to influence participation among working adults with non-specific LBP, but the value and relative importance of these components remain unknown. The study’s aim was to examine such specific components and their influence on individual preferences for exercise for secondary prevention of non-specific LBP among working adults. Methods In a discrete choice experiment, working individuals with non-specific LBP answered a web-based questionnaire. Each respondent was given ten pairs of hypothetical exercise programs and asked to choose one option from each pair. The choices comprised six attributes of exercise (i.e., type of training, design, intensity, frequency, proximity and incentives), each with either three or four levels. A conditional logit regression that reflected the random utility model was used to analyze the responses. Results The final study population consisted of 112 participants. The participants’ preferred exercise option was aerobic (i.e., cardiovascular) rather than strength training, group exercise with trainer supervision, rather than individual or unsupervised exercise. They also preferred high intensity exercise performed at least once or twice per week. The most popular types of incentive were exercise during working hours and a wellness allowance rather than coupons for sports goods. The results show that the relative value of some attribute levels differed between young adults (age ≤ 44 years) and older adults (age ≥ 45 years) in terms of the level of trainer supervision required, exercise intensity, travel time to exercise location and financial incentives. For active study participants, exercise frequency (i.e., twice per week, 1.15; CI: 0.25; 2.06) influenced choice of exercise. For individuals with more than one child, travel time (i.e., 20 minutes, -0.55; CI: 0.65; 3.26) was also an influential attribute for choice of exercise, showing that people with children at home preferred to exercise close to home. Conclusions This study adds to our knowledge about what types of exercise working adults with back pain are most likely to participate in. The exercise should be a cardiovascular type of training carried out in a group with trainer supervision. It should also be of high intensity and preferably performed twice per week during working hours. Coupons for sports goods do not appear to motivate physical activity among workers with LBP. The findings of the study could have a substantial impact on the planning and development of exercise provision and promotion strategies to improve non-specific LBP. Providers and employers may be able to improve participation in exercise programs for adults with non-specific LBP by focusing on the exercise components which are the most attractive. This in turn would improve satisfaction and adherence to exercise interventions aimed at preventing recurrent non-specific LBP."
https://openalex.org/W2774358564,"In the eastern tropical Atlantic, the orangeback flying squid Sthenoteuthis pteropus (Steenstrup 1855) (Cephalopoda, Ommastrephidae) is a dominant species of the epipelagic nekton community. This carnivore squid has a short lifespan and is one of the fastest-growing squids. In this study, we characterise the role of S. pteropus in the pelagic food web of the eastern tropical Atlantic by investigating its diet and the dynamics of its feeding habits throughout its ontogeny and migration. During three expeditions in the eastern tropical Atlantic in 2015, 129 specimens were caught by hand jigging. Stomach content analyses (via visual identification and DNA barcoding) were combined with stable isotope data (∂15N and ∂13C) of muscle tissue to describe diet, feeding habits and trophic ecology of S. pteropus. Additionally, stable isotope analyses of incremental samples along the squid's gladius-the chitinous spiniform structure supporting the muscles and organs-were carried out to explore possible diet shifts through ontogeny and migration. Our results show that S. pteropus preys mainly on myctophid fishes (e.g. Myctophum asperum, Myctophum nitidulum, Vinciguerria spp.), but also on other teleost species, cephalopods (e.g. Enoploteuthidae, Bolitinidae, Ommastrephidae), crustaceans and possibly on gelatinous zooplankton as well. The squid shows a highly opportunistic feeding behaviour that includes cannibalism. Our study indicates that the trophic position of S. pteropus may increase by approximately one trophic level from a mantle length of 15 cm to 47 cm. The reconstructed isotope-based feeding chronologies of the gladii revealed high intra- and inter-individual variability in the squid's trophic position and foraging area. These findings are not revealed by diet or muscle tissue stable isotope analysis. This suggests a variable and complex life history involving individual variation and migration. The role of S. pteropus in transferring energy and nutrients from lower to higher trophic levels may be underestimated and important for understanding how a changing ocean impacts food webs in the eastern Atlantic."
https://openalex.org/W2775468092,"Sodium intake is associated with obesity and metabolic disorder in the general population. However, sodium intake is significantly reduced according to the decrease of energy intake in older adults although the prevalence of obesity is higher than younger adults. We evaluate the association of sodium excretion (UNa) with blood pressure, obesity, metabolic disorders, and albuminuria according to age. An observational study using data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey IV-V (2008–2011) was performed (N = 18,146). The 24 hour UNa was estimated from a single fasting urine sample.Participants aged≥75 years showed the highest risk for hypertension (HTN) in the highest quartile of UNa (1.769, 95% CI, 1.174–2.665), and the risks for HTN increased with advancing age. Obesity was not associated with UNa in participants aged≥75 years, and hypertriglyceridemia and body fat were not related to UNa in participants aged≥65 years, although these values were significantly associated with UNa in participants aged<65 years. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and insulin resistance (IR) were associated with UNa only in participants aged 20–39 years. The highest quartile of UNa showed a 3.777 fold increased risk for albuminuria in those aged 20–39 years (95% CI, 1.130–12.630), and a 1.885 fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.156–3.075) among participants aged 40–64 years. In participants aged≥65 years, albuminuria was not associated with UNa. In contrast with HTN, UNa was not associated with albuminuria, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, IFG, and IR in older adults despite a strong association in younger adults."

https://openalex.org/W2774531084,"The plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 gene (PVT1) plays an oncogenic role in the initiation and progression of multiple cancers. In this study, by using deep-sequencing data and follow-up data in the Cancer Genome Atlas-Uveal melanomas (TCGA-UVM), we assessed the association between the expression of PVT1 and clinicopathological characteristics of patients with uveal melanoma, the mechanism of its dysregulation and its prognostic value. Results showed that high PVT1 expression group had a higher proportion of epithelioid cell dominant disease (a more malignant histological subtype than spindle cell dominant disease) and more cases of extrascleral extension (a risk factor for metastasis) compared with the low PVT1 expression group. 61 out of 80 cases (76.3%) of primary uveal melanoma had PVT1 amplification in TCGA-UVM. In addition, PVT1 expression was strongly and negatively correlated with its methylation status (Pearson's r = -0.712, Spearman’s r = -0.806). By performing univariate and multivariate analysis, we found that high PVT1 expression was an independent predictor of poor OS in patients with uveal melanoma (HR: 12.015, 95%CI: 1.854–77.876, p = 0.009). Based on these findings, we infer that PVT1 expression is modulated by both DNA amplification and methylation and its expression might serve as a valuable and specific prognostic biomarker in terms of OS in uveal melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2771303735,"The colonic response to stress is greater in female rats than in male rats. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of probiotics in the repeated water avoidance stress (rWAS)-induced colonic microinflammation model of Wistar rats in a sex-specific manner. The three groups (no-stress, WAS, and WAS with probiotics) were exposed to r-WAS for 1 h daily for 10 days, and Lactobacillus farciminis was administered by oral gavage for 10 days to animals in the probiotics group. The visceromotor response (VMR) to colorectal distension (CRD) was assessed using a barostat and noninvasive manometry before and after WAS exposure. Immunohistochemistry for mast cells and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of mucosal cytokines were performed using distal colon tissue after the animals were sacrificed. Significant reduction of VMR to CRD (visceral analgesia) was observed at 60 mmHg in the female WAS group (P = 0.045), but not in males. In addition, the female WAS with probiotics group showed a significantly lower colonic mucosal mast cell count in comparison to the female WAS group (P = 0.013), but this phenomenon was not observed in the male group. The colonic mucosal mRNA levels of interferon-γ (IFNR), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFA), interleukin (IL) 6, and IL17 were higher in the female WAS group than in the male WAS group. The mRNA levels of IFNR, TNFA, and IL6 were significantly decreased in WAS females who received probiotics (all P < 0.050). In conclusion, rWAS is induced in a sex-specific manner. A 10-day-long treatment with L. farciminis is an effective therapy for rWAS-induced colonic microinflammation in female rates, but not in male rats."
https://openalex.org/W2772048458,"The multiple extremes resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans is able to withstand harsh conditions of simulated outer space environment. The Tanpopo orbital mission performs a long-term space exposure of D. radiodurans aiming to investigate the possibility of interplanetary transfer of life. The revealing of molecular machinery responsible for survivability of D. radiodurans in the outer space environment can improve our understanding of underlying stress response mechanisms. In this paper, we have evaluated the molecular response of D. radiodurans after the exposure to space-related conditions of UVC irradiation and vacuum. Notably, scanning electron microscopy investigations showed that neither morphology nor cellular integrity of irradiated cells was affected, while integrated proteomic and metabolomic analysis revealed numerous molecular alterations in metabolic and stress response pathways. Several molecular key mechanisms of D. radiodurans, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the DNA damage response systems, ROS scavenging systems and transcriptional regulators responded in order to cope with the stressful situation caused by UVC irradiation under vacuum conditions. These results reveal the effectiveness of the integrative proteometabolomic approach as a tool in molecular analysis of microbial stress response caused by space-related factors."
https://openalex.org/W2772829482,"Recent work has established that visual working memory is subject to serial dependence: current information in memory blends with that from the recent past as a function of their similarity. This tuned temporal smoothing likely promotes the stability of memory in the face of noise and occlusion. Serial dependence accumulates over several seconds in memory and deteriorates with increased separation between trials. While this phenomenon has been extensively characterized in behavior, its neural mechanism is unknown. In the present study, we investigate the circuit-level origins of serial dependence in a biophysical model of cortex. We explore two distinct kinds of mechanisms: stable persistent activity during the memory delay period and dynamic “activity-silent” synaptic plasticity. We find that networks endowed with both strong reverberation to support persistent activity and dynamic synapses can closely reproduce behavioral serial dependence. Specifically, elevated activity drives synaptic augmentation, which biases activity on the subsequent trial, giving rise to a spatiotemporally tuned shift in the population response. Our hybrid neural model is a theoretical advance beyond abstract mathematical characterizations, offers testable hypotheses for physiological research, and demonstrates the power of biological insights to provide a quantitative explanation of human behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2773490423,"Background HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) poses a threat to future antiretroviral therapy success. Monitoring HIVDR patterns is of particular importance in populations such as sex workers (SWs), where documented HIV prevalence is between 34–89%, and in countries with limited therapeutic options. Currently in South Africa, there is a dearth in evidence and no ongoing surveillance of HIVDR amongst sex work populations. This study aims to describe the prevalence of HIVDR amongst a sample of female sex workers (FSWs) from Soweto, South Africa. Methodology A cross-sectional, respondent driven sampling (RDS) recruitment methodology was used to enrol FSWs based in Soweto. Participants were tested for HIV and undertook a survey that included HIV knowledge and treatment status. Whole blood specimens were collected from HIV positive FSWs to measure for CD4 counts, viral load (VL) and perform HIVDR genotyping. Frequencies were determined for categorical variables and medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) for the continuous. Results Of the 508 enrolled participants, 55% (n = 280) were HIV positive and of median age 32 (IQR: 20–51) years. Among the HIV positive, 51.8% (132/269) were defined as virologically suppressed (VL < 400 copies/ml). Of the 119 individuals with unsuppressed viral loads who were successfully genotyped for resistance testing 37.8% (45/119) had detectable drug resistance. In this group, HIVDR mutations were found amongst 73.7% (14/19) of individuals on treatment, 27.4% (26/95) of individuals who were treatment naïve, and 100% (5/5) of defaulters. One phylogenetic cluster was found amongst treatment naïve FSWs. The K103N mutation was detected most commonly in 68.9% (31/45) individuals with HIVDR mutations, with 20/26 (76.9%) of treatment naïve FSW with detectable resistance having this mutation. The M184V mutation was found in both FSWs on treatment (12/14, 85.7%) and those defaulting (1/5, 20.0%). Discussion More than one third (45/119) of the genotyped sample had HIVDR, with resistance to the NNRTI class being the most common. Almost half of HIV positive FSWs had unsuppressed viral loads, increasing the likelihood for onward transmission of HIV. Disturbingly, more than 1:4 treatment naïve women with unsuppressed viral loads had HIVDR suggesting that possible sexual transmission of drug resistance is occurring in this high-risk population. Given the high burden of HIVDR in a population with a high background prevalence of HIV, it is imperative that routine monitoring of HIVDR be implemented. Understanding transmission dynamics of HIVDR in FSW and its impact on treatment success should be urgently elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W2773768894,"Elucidating the stoichiometry and resorption patterns of multiple nutrients is of essential importance to holistically understanding plant nutrition and biogeochemical cycling. Although many studies on ecological stoichiometry have been carried out, surprisingly few of them were simultaneously done on the investigation of both nutrient resorption efficiency and stoichiometry for different-aged plantations of a perennial tree. Here, both green and senesced leaf samples were collected from four Larix kaempfer plantations aged of 8, 15, 22, and 32 years in the Qinling Mountains to examine nutrients resorption efficiency and stoichiometry characteristics. The results suggested that the nutrient concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Al, and Fe in both green and senesced leaves of L. kaempferi (a deciduous conifer tree) did not show a regular change trends along the plantation ages in the Qinling Mountains. The concentrations of the most nutrients examined, except for Fe, in the green leaves were relatively lower than or close to the required physiological concentrations, suggesting a relative limitation of multiple nutrients exists in L. kaempferi for its above-ground biomass growth. The rank order of resorption efficiencies of four key nutrients (N, P, K, and Mg) was K (80.89%) > N (67.42%) > P (65.34%) > Mg (41.16%), whereas the nutrient Ca and Fe tended to accumulate in senesced leaves. Overall, the nutrient resorption efficiency of all examined elements did not exhibit a regular trend corresponding to the change of the plantation ages in L. kaempferi, but it was positively related to the nutrient concentrations in green leaves. The mean C:N and C:P ratios in the green and senesced leaves were significantly higher than those reported globally (on average). By contrast, the N:P ratio, at <14, was not only much lower than that reported for both China's flora and globally (on average), but it did suggest that the N nutrient limits growth of L. kaempferi in these plantations. Taken together, the results of this study are of substantial interest and value to forest managers and for the sustainable development of the Qinling forest ecosystems."

Nevertheless, the literature reveals some lack concerning the assessment of the muscles that ensure glenohumeral stability during specific lifting tasks. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the stabilization function of shoulder muscles during a lifting task. Kinematics and muscle electromyograms (n = 9) were recorded from 13 healthy adults during a bi-manual lifting task performed from the hip to the shoulder level. A generic upper-limb OpenSim model was implemented to simulate glenohumeral stability and instability by performing static optimizations with and without glenohumeral stability constraints. This procedure enabled to compute the level of shoulder muscle activity and forces in the two conditions. Without the stability constraint, the simulated movement was unstable during 74%±16% of the time. The force of the supraspinatus was significantly increased of 107% (p<0.002) when the glenohumeral stability constraint was implemented. The increased supraspinatus force led to greater compressive force (p<0.001) and smaller shear force (p<0.001), which contributed to improved glenohumeral stability. It was concluded that the supraspinatus may be the main contributor to glenohumeral stability during lifting task."
https://openalex.org/W2771422110,"Lifelong ART is essential to reducing HIV mortality and ending the epidemic, however the interplay between socioeconomic position and long-term outcomes of HIV-infected persons receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa is unknown. Furthering the understanding of factors related to long-term ART outcomes in this important region will aid the successful scale-up of ART programs. We enrolled 559 HIV-infected Ugandan adults starting ART in 2004–2005 at the Infectious Diseases Institute in Kampala, Uganda and followed them for 10 years. We documented baseline employment status, regular household income, education level, housing description, physical ability, and CD4 count. Viral load was measured every six months. Proportional hazard regression tested for associations between baseline characteristics and 1) mortality, 2) virologic failure, and 3) mortality or virologic failure as a composite outcome. Over ten years 23% (n = 127) of participants died, 6% (n = 31) were lost-to-follow-up and 23% (107/472) experienced virologic treatment failure. In Kaplan-Meier analysis we observed an association between employment and mortality, with the highest cumulative probability of death occurring in unemployed individuals. In univariate analysis unemployment and disease severity were associated with mortality, but in multivariable analysis the only association with mortality was disease severity. We observed an association between higher household income and an increased incidence of both virologic failure and the combined outcome, and an association between self-employment and lower incidence of virologic failure and the combined outcome when compared to unemployment. Formal education level and housing status were unrelated to outcomes. It is feasible to achieve good ten-year survival, retention-in-care, and viral suppression in a socioeconomically diverse population in a resource-limited setting. Unemployment appears to be related to adverse 10-year ART outcomes. A low level of formal education does not appear to be a barrier to successful long-term ART."
https://openalex.org/W2774271174,"Background Enterobacter cloacae is a major nosocomial pathogen causing bloodstream infections. We retrospectively conducted a study to assess antimicrobial susceptibility and phylogenetic relationships of E. cloacae bloodstream isolates in two tertiary university-affiliated hospitals in Shanghai, in order to facilitate managements of E. cloacae bloodstream infections and highlight some unknowns for future prevention. Methods Fifty-three non-duplicate E. cloacae bloodstream isolates were consecutively collected from 2013 to 2016. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion. PCR was performed to detect extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL), carbapenemase and colistin resistance (MCR-1) gene. Plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamase (pAmpC) genes were detected using a multiplex PCR assay targeting MIR/ACT gene (closely related to chromosomal EBC family gene) and other plasmid-mediated genes, including DHA, MOX, CMY, ACC, and FOX. eBURST was applied to analyze multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Results The rates of resistance to all tested antibiotics were <40%. Among 53 E. cloacae isolates, 8(15.1%) were ESBL producers, 3(5.7%) were carbapenemase producers and 18(34.0%) were pAmpC producers. ESBL producers bear significantly higher resistance to cefotaxime (100.0%), ceftazidime (100.0%), aztreonam (100.0%), piperacillin (87.5%), tetracycline (75.0%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (62.5%) than non-producers (p<0.05). PAmpC- and non-producers both presented low resistance rates (<40%) to all antibiotics (p>0.05). SHV (6/8, 75.0%) and MIR/ACT (15/18, 83.3%) predominated in ESBL and pAmpC producers respectively. Moreover, 2 isolates co-carried TEM-1, SHV-12, IMP-26 and DHA-1. MLST analysis distinguished the 53 isolates into 51 STs and only ST414 and ST520 were assigned two isolates of each (2/53). Conclusion The antimicrobial resistance rates were low among 53 E. cloacae bloodstream isolates in the two hospitals. Multiclonality disclosed no evidence on spread of these isolates in Shanghai. The simultaneous presence of ESBL, carbapenemase and pAmpC detected in 2 isolates was firstly reported in Shanghai, which necessitated active ongoing surveillances and consistent prevention and control of E. cloacae."
https://openalex.org/W2771063902,"Objective To retrospectively determine the sensitivity of preoperative CT in the detection of small (≤ 10 mm) colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) nodules in patients undergoing liver resection. Methods The institutional review board approved the study and waived informed consent. We included 461 pathologically confirmed CRLM nodules in 211 patients (including 71 women; mean age, 66.4 years) who underwent 229 liver resections following abdominal CT. Prior to 163 resections, gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MR imaging was also performed. Nodules were matched between pathology reports and prospective CT reports following a predefined algorithm. Per-nodule sensitivity of CT was calculated by nodule-size category. Generalized estimating equations were used to adjust for within-case correlation. Results Fourteen nodule sizes were missing in the pathology report. Nodules of 1–5 mm and 6–10 mm accounted for 8.1% (n = 36) and 23.5% (n = 105) of the remaining 447 nodules, and the number of nodules gradually decreased as nodule size increased beyond 10 mm. The overall sensitivity of CT was 81.2% (95% confidence interval, 77.1%, 85.2%; 365/461). The sensitivity was 8% (0%, 17%; 3/36), 55% (45%, 65%; 59/105), 91%, 95%, and 100% for nodules of 1–5 mm, 6–10 mm, 11–15 mm, 16–20 mm, and >20 mm, respectively. The nodule-size distribution was similar between resections undergoing gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging and those not undergoing the MR imaging. Conclusion CT has limited sensitivity for nodules of ≤ 10 mm and particularly of ≤ 5 mm."
https://openalex.org/W2772846086,"Objectives The collagen VI related muscular dystrophies (COL6-RD), Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD) and Bethlem myopathy (BM) are among the most common congenital muscular dystrophies and are characterized by distal joint laxity and a combination of distal and proximal joint contractures. Inheritance can be dominant negative (DN) or recessive depending on the type and location of the mutation. DN mutations allow incorporation of abnormal chains into secreted tetramers and are the most commonly identified mutation type in COL6-RD. Null alleles (nonsense, frameshift, and large deletions) do not allow incorporation of abnormal chains and act recessively. To better define the pathways disrupted by mutations in collagen VI, we have used a transcriptional profiling approach with RNA-Seq to identify differentially expressed genes in COL6-RD individuals from controls. Methods RNA-Seq allows precise detection of all expressed transcripts in a sample and provides a tool for quantification of expression data on a genomic scale. We have used RNA-Seq to identify differentially expressed genes in cultured dermal fibroblasts from 13 COL6-RD individuals (8 dominant negative and 5 null) and 6 controls. To better assess the transcriptional changes induced by abnormal collagen VI in the extracellular matrix (ECM); we compared transcriptional profiles from subjects with DN mutations and subjects with null mutations to transcriptional profiles from controls. Results Differentially expressed transcripts between COL6-RD and control fibroblasts include upregulation of ECM components and downregulation of factors controlling matrix remodeling and repair. DN and null samples are differentiated by downregulation of genes involved with DNA replication and repair in null samples. Conclusions Differentially expressed genes identified here may help identify new targets for development of therapies and biomarkers to assess the efficacy of treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2773411412,"Background During observation of the Necker cube perception becomes unstable and alternates repeatedly between a from-above-perspective (“fap”) and a from-below-perspective (“fbp”) interpretation. Both interpretations are physically equally plausible, however, observers usually show an a priori top-down bias in favor of the fap interpretation. Patients with Autism spectrum disorder are known to show an altered pattern of perception with a focus on sensory details. In the present study we tested whether this altered perceptual processing affects their reversal dynamics and reduces the perceptual bias during Necker cube observation. Methods 19 participants with Asperger syndrome and 16 healthy controls observed a Necker cube stimulus continuously for 5 minutes and indicated perceptual reversals by key press. We compared reversal rates (number of reversals per minute) and the distributions of dwell times for the two interpretations between observer groups. Results Asperger participants showed less perceptual reversal than controls. Six Asperger participants did not perceive any reversal at all, whereas all observers from the control group perceived at least five reversals within the five minutes observation time. Further, control participants showed the typical perceptual bias with significant longer median dwell times for the fap compared to the fbp interpretation. No such perceptual bias was found in the Asperger group. Discussion The perceptual system weights the incomplete and ambiguous sensory input with memorized concepts in order to construct stable and reliable percepts. In the case of the Necker cube stimulus, two perceptual interpretations are equally compatible with the sensory information and internal fluctuations may cause perceptual alternations between them—with a slightly larger probability value for the fap interpretation (perceptual bias). Smaller reversal rates in Asperger observers may result from the dominance of bottom-up sensory input over endogenous top-down factors. The latter may also explain the absence of a fap bias."
https://openalex.org/W2775487972,"The intensity used during transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in both, clinical practice and research studies, is often based on subjective commands such as “strong but comfortable sensation”. There is no consensus regarding the effectiveness dose of TENS. The objective was to determine the difference in the effect of spinal TENS on soleus H-reflex modulation when applied by two therapists instructed to apply the stimulation at a “strong but comfortable” intensity. Twenty healthy volunteers divided into two groups: Therapist 1 (n = 10) and Therapist 2 (n = 10). Both therapist applied spinal TENS and sham stimulation at the T10–12 spinal level for 40min in random order to each subject, at an intensity designed to produce a “strong but comfortable” sensation. To avoid habituation, the intensity was adjusted every 2min. Soleus H-reflex was recorded before, during, and 10min after TENS by an observer blinded to the stimulus applied. Despite the instruction to apply TENS at a “strong comfortable” level, a significant difference in current density was identified: Therapist 1 (0.67mA/cm2, SD 0.54) applied more than Therapist 2 (0.53mA/cm2, SD 0.57; p<0.001) at the onset of the intervention. Maximal peak-to-peak H-reflex amplitude was inhibited significantly more 10min following TENS applied by Therapist 1 (-0.15mV, SD 0.16) compared with Therapist 2 (0.04mV, SD 0.16; p = 0.03). Furthermore, current density significantly correlated with the inhibitory effect on peak-to-peak Soleus H-reflex amplitude 10 min after stimulation (Rho = -0.38; p = 0.04). TENS intensity dosage by the therapist based on the subjective perception of the participants alone is unreliable and requires objective standardization. In addition, higher current density TENS produced greater inhibition of the Soleus H-reflex."
https://openalex.org/W2772668938,"Many individuals lose less weight than expected in response to exercise interventions when considering the increased energy expenditure of exercise (ExEE). This is due to energy compensation in response to ExEE, which may include increases in energy intake (EI) and decreases in non-exercise physical activity (NEPA). We examined the degree of energy compensation in healthy young men and women in response to interval training.Data were examined from a prior study in which 24 participants (mean age, BMI, & VO2max = 28 yrs, 27.7 kg•m-2, and 32 mL∙kg-1∙min-1) completed either 4 weeks of sprint-interval training or high-intensity interval training. Energy compensation was calculated from changes in body composition (air displacement plethysmography) and exercise energy expenditure was calculated from mean heart rate based on the heart rate-VO2 relationship. Differences between high (≥ 100%) and low (< 100%) levels of energy compensation were assessed. Linear regressions were utilized to determine associations between energy compensation and ΔVO2max, ΔEI, ΔNEPA, and Δresting metabolic rate.Very large individual differences in energy compensation were noted. In comparison to individuals with low levels of compensation, individuals with high levels of energy compensation gained fat mass, lost fat-free mass, and had lower change scores for VO2max and NEPA. Linear regression results indicated that lower levels of energy compensation were associated with increases in ΔVO2max (p < 0.001) and ΔNEPA (p < 0.001).Considerable variation exists in response to short-term, low dose interval training. In agreement with prior work, increases in ΔVO2max and ΔNEPA were associated with lower energy compensation. Future studies should focus on identifying if a dose-response relationship for energy compensation exists in response to interval training, and what underlying mechanisms and participant traits contribute to the large variation between individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2775072257,"Curcumin has protective effects against toxic agents and shows preventive properties for various diseases. Particulate material with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤10 μm (PM10) and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs) induce endothelial dysfunction and activation. We explored whether curcumin is able to attenuate different events related to endothelial activation. This includes adhesion, expression of adhesion molecules and oxidative stress induced by PM10 and TiO2-NPs. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with 1, 10 and 100 μM curcumin for 1 h and then exposed to PM10 at 3 μg/cm2 or TiO2-NPs at 10 μg/cm2. Cell adhesion was evaluated by co-culture with U937 human myelomonocytic cells. Adhesion molecules expression was measured by flow cytometry after 3 or 24 h of exposure. Oxidative stress was determined by 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (H2DCF) oxidation. PM10 and TiO2-NPs induced the adhesion of U937 cells and the expression of E- and P-selectins, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1). The expression of E- and P-selectins matched the adhesion of monocytes to HUVEC after 3 h. In HUVEC treated with 1 or 10 μM curcumin, the expression of adhesion molecules and monocytes adhesion was significantly diminished. Curcumin also partially reduced the H2DCF oxidation induced by PM10 and TiO2-NPs. Our results suggest an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant role by curcumin attenuating the activation caused on endothelial cells by exposure to particles. Therefore, curcumin could be useful in the treatment of diseases where an inflammatory process and endothelial activation are involved."
https://openalex.org/W2775057239,"The control of bipedal posture in humans is subject to non-ideal conditions such as delayed sensation and heartbeat noise. However, the controller achieves a high level of functionality by utilizing body dynamics dexterously. In order to elucidate the neural mechanism responsible for postural control, the present study made use of an experimental setup involving rats because they have more accessible neural structures. The experimental design requires rats to stand bipedally in order to obtain a water reward placed in a water supplier above them. Their motions can be measured in detail using a motion capture system and a force plate. Rats have the ability to stand bipedally for long durations (over 200 s), allowing for the construction of an experimental environment in which the steady standing motion of rats could be measured. The characteristics of the measured motion were evaluated based on aspects of the rats' intersegmental coordination and power spectrum density (PSD). These characteristics were compared with those of the human bipedal posture. The intersegmental coordination of the standing rats included two components that were similar to that of standing humans: center of mass and trunk motion. The rats' PSD showed a peak at approximately 1.8 Hz and the pattern of the PSD under the peak frequency was similar to that of the human PSD. However, the frequencies were five times higher in rats than in humans. Based on the analysis of the rats' bipedal standing motion, there were some common characteristics between rat and human standing motions. Thus, using standing rats is expected to be a powerful tool to reveal the neural basis of postural control."
https://openalex.org/W2775228470,"Private sector drug shops are an important source of malaria treatment in Africa, yet diagnosis without parasitological testing is common among these providers. Accurate rapid diagnostic tests for malaria (mRDTs) require limited training and present an opportunity to increase access to correct diagnosis. The present study was a cost-effectiveness analysis of the introduction of mRDTs in Ugandan drug shops.Drug shop vendors were trained to perform and sell subsidised mRDTs and artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) in the intervention arm while vendors offered ACTs following presumptive diagnosis of malaria in the control arm. The effect on the proportion of customers with fever 'appropriately treated of malaria with ACT' was captured during a randomised trial in drug shops in Mukono District, Uganda. Health sector costs included: training of drug shop vendors, community sensitisation, supervision and provision of mRDTs and ACTs to drug shops. Household costs of treatment-seeking were captured in a representative sample of drug shop customers.The introduction of mRDTs in drug shops was associated with a large improvement of diagnosis and treatment of malaria, resulting in low incremental costs for the health sector at US$0.55 per patient appropriately treated of malaria. High expenditure on non-ACT drugs by households contributed to higher incremental societal costs of US$3.83. Sensitivity analysis showed that mRDTs would become less cost-effective compared to presumptive diagnosis with increasing malaria prevalence and lower adherence to negative mRDT results.mRDTs in drug shops improved the targeting of ACTs to malaria patients and are likely to be considered cost-effective compared to presumptive diagnosis, although the increased costs borne by households when the test result is negative are a concern."
https://openalex.org/W2771411754,"During the 2013-2014 influenza season, Public Health England extended routine influenza vaccination to all 2- and 3-year-old children in England. To estimate the impact of this change in policy on influenza-related morbidity and mortality, we developed a disease transmission and surveillance model informed by real-world data.We combined real-world and literature data sources to construct a model of influenza transmission and surveillance in England. Data were obtained for four influenza seasons, starting with the 2010-2011 season. Bayesian inference was used to estimate model parameters on a season-by-season basis to assess the impact of targeting 2- and 3-year-old children for influenza vaccination. This provided the basis for the construction of counterfactual scenarios comparing vaccination rates of ~2% and ~35% in the 2- and 3- year-old population to estimate reductions in general practitioner (GP) influenza-like-illness (ILI) consultations, respiratory hospitalizations and deaths in the overall population.Our model was able to replicate the main patterns of influenza across the four seasons as observed through laboratory surveillance data. Targeting 2- and 3-year-old children for influenza vaccination resulted in reductions in the general population of between 6.2-9.9% in influenza-attributable GP ILI consultations, 6.1-10.7% in influenza-attributable respiratory hospitalizations, and 5.7-9.4% in influenza-attributable deaths. The decrease in influenza-attributable ILI consultations represents a reduction of between 4.5% and 7.3% across all ILI consultations. The reduction in influenza-attributable respiratory hospitalizations represents a reduction of between 1.2% and 2.3% across all respiratory hospitalizations. Reductions in influenza-attributable respiratory deaths represent a reduction of between 0.9% and 2.4% in overall respiratory deaths.This study has provided evidence that extending routine influenza vaccination to all healthy children aged 2 and 3 years old leads to benefits in terms of reduced utilization of healthcare resources and fewer respiratory health outcomes and deaths."
https://openalex.org/W2771671267,"A new member of the genus Potexvirus was fully sequenced and characterized. The virus was isolated from babaco (Vasconcellea x heilbornii), a natural hybrid native to Ecuador. The virus contains a 6,692 nt long genome organized in five open reading frames in an arrangement typical of other potexviruses. Sequence comparisons revealed close relatedness with Papaya mosaic virus (PapMV), Alternathera mosaic virus (AltMV) and Senna mosaic virus (SenMV), exhibiting nucleotide identities up to 67% for the polymerase (Pol) and 68% for the coat protein (CP), with deduced amino acid identities of 70% and 72% for the Pol and CP, respectively. The presence of an AlkB domain, in the polymerase region, was observed. Terminal nucleotide sequences were conserved across potexviruses with characteristic motifs and predicted secondary structures at the 3' UTR. Although serologically undistinguishable from PapMV and AltMV, the new virus showed differences in host range and symptom induction. The name babaco mosaic virus is proposed for this newly characterized Potexvirus. The complete genome sequence of the new virus has been deposited in NCBI GenBank under accession number MF978248."
https://openalex.org/W2774813342,"The prognostic value of repeat transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) in patients with diagnosed high-risk, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) was investigated. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients treated from October 2004 to December 2013 at Seoul National University who underwent repeated TURBT within 2–6 weeks after an initial resection. The study enrolled patients who had been diagnosed with NMIBC at both the initial and repeat TURBT; patients with muscle-invasive tumors on repeat TURBT were excluded. We used stepwise multivariate Cox regression models stratified by study to assess the independent effects of the predictive factors and estimated hazard ratios (HRs) from the Cox models. We investigated a total of 198 patients who were diagnosed with high-risk NMIBC. In logistic regression analyses, number of bladder tumors (2–7: OR, 2.319; 8≤: OR, 3.353; p<0.05), initially high tumor grade (OR, 2.435; p = 0.040), and presence of carcinoma in situ lesion (OR, 3.639; p = 0.017) correlated with residual tumor in the repeated-TURBT specimen. T1 stage in repeated-TURBT significantly correlated with recurrence (HR, 1.837; p = 0.010) and progression (HR, 2.806; p = 0.029) in multivariate analysis. The high grades of tumors in repeated-TURBT also significantly correlated with progression but not recurrence in the multivariate analysis (HR 2.152; p = 0.008). In this study, the pathologic findings in repeated-TURBT correlated with recurrence and progression in high-risk NMIBC. Repeated-TURBT is valuable because it can predict the recurrence and progression of high-risk NMIBC in addition to obtaining accurate pathologic findings."
https://openalex.org/W2771933686,"The incidence of self-reported cognitive failures among older adults may be an index of successful cognitive aging. However, self-reported cognitive failures are biased by variation in depressive symptomatology. This study examined age-related and socio-cultural context effects on cognitive failures while controlling for depressive symptoms. Both overall and specific factors of cognitive failures were determined. A further goal was to investigate the relationship between working memory and cognitive efficiency measures and cognitive failures. One hundred and thirty-nine cognitively healthy adults were recruited from two populations known to differ in their dispositions toward cognitive failures and depressive symptoms (Sardinia and northern Italy). The participants were assigned to Young Old (65–74 years old), Old (75–84 years of age) or Oldest Old (≥85 years of age) groups, and individually presented with a test battery including the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, the Centre for Epidemiological Studies of Depression Scale, and Forward and Backward Digit Span tests. Specific factors of cognitive failures were differentially associated with measures of depression and working memory. While age had no impact on any aspect of cognitive failures, overall and specific dispositions varied between the two populations. The overall liability to cognitive failure was lower in participants from Sardinia, however, this group also had a higher liability to lapses of action (Blunders factor). Overall, these findings highlight that richer information about cognitive failures may be revealed through the investigation of specific factors of cognitive failures. They also confirm that the absence of changes in cognitive failures across old age is independent of variation in depressive symptoms, at least among cognitively healthy elders."
https://openalex.org/W2774568732,"Background Screening for ovarian cancer (OC) in women at high risk consists of a combination of carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) and transvaginal ultrasound, despite their low sensitivity and specificity. This could be improved by the combination of several biomarkers, which has been shown in average risk patients but has not been investigated until now in female BRCA mutation carriers. Methods Using a multiplex, bead-based, immunoassay system, we analyzed the concentrations of leptin, prolactin, osteopontin, insulin-like growth factor II, macrophage inhibitory factor, CA125 and human epididymis antigen 4 in 26 healthy wild type women, 26 healthy BRCA1 mutation carriers, 28 wildtype OC patients and 26 OC patients with BRCA1 mutation. Results Using the ROC analysis, we found a high overall sensitivity of 94.3% in differentiating healthy controls from OC patients with comparable results in the wildtype subgroup (sensitivity 92.8%, AUC = 0.988; p = 5.2e-14) as well as in BRCA1 mutation carriers (sensitivity 95.2%, AUC = 0.978; p = 1.7e-15) at an overall specificity of 92.3%. The used algorithm also allowed to identify healthy BRCA1 mutation carriers when compared to healthy wildtype women (sensitivity 88.4%, specificity 80.7%, AUC = 0.895; p = 6e-08), while this was less pronounced in patients with OC (sensitivity 66.7%, specificity 67.8%, AUC = 0.724; p = 0.00065). Conclusion We have developed an algorithm, which can differentiate between healthy women and OC patients and have for the first time shown, that such an algorithm can also be used in BRCA mutation carriers. To clarify a suggested benefit to the existing early detection program, large prospective trials with mainly early stage OC cases are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2772658503,"The molecular mechanisms involved in breast cancer progression and metastasis still remain unclear to date. It is a heterogeneous disease featuring several different phenotypes with consistently different biological characteristics. Neuroligins are neural cell adhesion molecules that have been implicated in heterotopic cell adhesion. In humans, alterations in neuroligin genes are implicated in autism and other cognitive diseases. Until recently, neuroligins have been shown to be abundantly expressed in blood vessels and also play a role implicated in the growth of glioma cells. Here we report increased expression of neuroligin 4X (NLGN4X) in breast cancer. We found NLGN4X was abundantly expressed in breast cancer tissues. NLGN4X expression data for all breast cancer cell lines in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) was analyzed. Correlation between NLGN4X levels and clinicopathologic parameters were analyzed within Oncomine datasets. Evaluation of these bioinfomatic datasets results revealed that NLGN4X expression was higher in triple negative breast cancer cells, particularly the basal subtype and tissues versus non-triple-negative sets. Its level was also observed to be higher in metastatic tissues. RT-PCR, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence study of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells validated that NLGN4X was increased in MDA-MB-231. Knockdown of NLGN4X expression by siRNA decreased cell proliferation and migration significantly in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. NLGN4X knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in induction of apoptosis as determined by annexin staining, elevated caspase 3/7 and cleaved PARP by flow cytometry. High NLGN4X expression highly correlated with decrease in relapse free-survival in TNBC. NLGN4X might represent novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for breast cancer. Inhibition of NLGN4X may be a new target for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2772880203,"Purpose Alcohol consumption is an established and important risk factor for breast cancer incidence in the general population. However, the relationship between alcohol and mortality among women with breast cancer is less clear. This study examines the effect of alcohol consumption on mortality in women affected with breast cancer at baseline from a high-risk family breast and ovarian cancer registry. Methods We studied 1116 women affected with breast cancer at baseline from the Metropolitan New York Registry. The examined reported alcohol consumption (total of beer, wine, liquor) was defined as the average number of drinks per week reported from age 12 to age at baseline. We assessed vital status of each participant using participant or family reported data and we used the National Death Index to supplement deaths reported through family updates. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the association between alcohol intake and overall mortality (HRO), breast cancer-specific mortality (HRBC), and non-breast cancer mortality (HRNBC), adjusted for confounders. Results After a mean follow-up of 9.1 years, we observed 211 total deaths and 58 breast cancer deaths. Compared to non-drinkers, we found that both low and moderate to heavy levels of alcohol intake were not associated with greater overall mortality (≤3 drinks/week: HRO: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.38–1.14); > 3 drinks/week: HRO: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.85–1.58), breast cancer–specific mortality (≤ 3 drinks/week: HRBC:0.62, 95% CI: 0.19–2.03; >3 drinks/week: HR BC: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.49–1.89), or non-breast cancer-specific mortality (≤3 drinks/week: HR NBC: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.32–1.6; >3 drinks/week: HRNBC: 1.18, 95% CI: 0.75–1.86).

https://openalex.org/W2774342892,"Gastrointestinal nematodes are a significant concern for animal health and well-being, and anthelmintic treatment is mainly performed through the use of chemical products. However, bioactive compounds produced by plants have shown promise for development as novel anthelmintics. The aim of this study is to assess the anthelmintic activity of protein fractions from Spigelia anthelmia on the gastrointestinal nematode Haemonchus contortus. Plant parts were separated into leaves, stems and roots, washed with distilled water, freeze-dried and ground into a fine powder. Protein extraction was performed with sodium phosphate buffer (75 mM, pH 7.0). The extract was fractionated using ammonium sulfate (0–90%) and extensively dialyzed. The resulting fractions were named LPF (leaf protein fraction), SPF (stem protein fraction) and RPF (root protein fraction), and the protein contents and activities of the fractions were analyzed. H. contortus egg hatching (EHA), larval exsheathment inhibition (LEIA) and larval migration inhibition (LMIA) assays were performed. Proteomic analysis was conducted, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) chromatographic profiles of the fractions were established to identify proteins and possible secondary metabolites. S. anthelmia fractions inhibited H. contortus egg hatching, with LPF having the most potent effects (EC50 0.17 mg mL-1). During LEIA, SPF presented greater efficiency than the other fractions (EC50 0.25 mg mL-1). According to LMIA, the fractions from roots, stems and leaves also reduced the number of larvae, with EC50 values of 0.11, 0.14 and 0.21 mg mL-1, respectively. Protein analysis indicated the presence of plant defense proteins in the S. anthelmia fractions, including protease, protease inhibitor, chitinase and others. Conversely, secondary metabolites were absent in the S. anthemia fractions. These results suggest that S. anthelmia proteins are promising for the control of the gastrointestinal nematode H. contortus."
https://openalex.org/W2772168005,"The experiments reported here used ""Reversed-Interior"" (RI) primes (e.g., cetupmor-COMPUTER) in three different masked priming paradigms in order to test between different models of orthographic coding/visual word recognition. The results of Experiment 1, using a standard masked priming methodology, showed no evidence of priming from RI primes, in contrast to the predictions of the Bayesian Reader and LTRS models. By contrast, Experiment 2, using a sandwich priming methodology, showed significant priming from RI primes, in contrast to the predictions of open bigram models, which predict that there should be no orthographic similarity between these primes and their targets. Similar results were obtained in Experiment 3, using a masked prime same-different task. The results of all three experiments are most consistent with the predictions derived from simulations of the Spatial-coding model."
https://openalex.org/W2773087977,"With the increasing availability of multi-dimensional biological datasets for the same samples (i.e., gene expression, microRNAs, copy numbers, mutations, methylations), it has now become possible to systematically understand the regulatory mechanisms operating in a cancer cell. For this task, it is important to discover a set of co-expressed genes with functions, representing a so-called functional gene module, because co-expressed genes tend to be co-regulated by the same regulators, including transcription factors, microRNAs, and copy number aberrations. Several algorithms have been used to identify such gene modules, including hierarchical clustering and non-negative matrix factorization. Although these algorithms have been applied to many microarray datasets, only a few systematic analyses of these algorithms have been performed for RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) data to date. Although gene expression levels determined based on microarray and RNA-Seq datasets tend to be highly correlated, the expression levels of some genes differ depending on the platforms used for analysis, which may result in the construction of different gene modules for the same samples. Here, we compare several module detection algorithms applied to both microarray and RNA-seq datasets. We further propose a new functional gene module detection algorithm (FGMD), which is based on a hierarchical clustering algorithm that was modified to reflect actual biological observations, including the fact that a single gene may be involved in multiple biological pathways. Application of existing algorithms and the new FGMD algorithm to breast cancer and ovarian cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas showed that the FGMD algorithm had the best performance for most of the functional pathway enrichment tests and in the transcription factor enrichment test. We expect that the FGMD algorithm will contribute to improving the identification of functional gene modules related to cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2774294268,"Currently, data on HIV-1 circulating strains among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Argentina is scarce. In South America, the distribution and the prevalence of BF recombinants are dissimilar and exhibit an underappreciated heterogeneity of recombinant structures. Here, we studied for the first time the genetic diversity of HIV-1 BF recombinants and their evolution over time through in-depth phylogenetic analysis and multiple recombination detection methods involving 337 HIV-1 nucleotide sequences (25 near full-length (NFL) and 312 partial pol gene) obtained from Argentinean MSM. The recombination profiles were studied using multiple in silico tools to characterize the genetic mosaicism, and phylogenetic approaches to infer their relationships. The evolutionary history of BF recombinants and subtype B sequences was reconstructed by a Bayesian coalescent-based method. By phylogenetic inference, 81/312 pol sequences clustered within BF clade. Of them, 46 sequences showed a genetic mosaic with CRF12_BF-like patterns, including plausible second-generation recombinants. Other CRFs_BF like (CRF17, 28, 29, 39, 42, 44, 47) and probable URFs_BF were less frequently found. Phylogenetic and recombination analyses on NFL sequences allowed a meticulous definition of new BF mosaics of genomic patterns. The Bayesian analyses pointed out quite consistent onset dates for the CRFs_BF clade based on B and F gene datasets (~1986 and ~1991 respectively). These results indicate that the CRFs_BF variants have been circulating among Argentinean MSM for about 30 years. This study reveals, through growing evidence showing the importance of MSM in the dynamics of the HIV-1 epidemic in Argentina, the coexistence of CRF12_BF-like and high diversity of strains exhibiting several BF mosaic patterns, including non-reported URFs that may reflect active clusters as potential intervention targets to hinder HIV-1 transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2774512453,"The repressive role of p53 on the human mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK) core promoter from ‒266 to +54, relative to the transcription start site, has been determined. The MCAK mRNA and protein levels were 2.1- and 3.0-fold higher, respectively, in HCT116 (p53‒/‒) than in HCT116 (p53+/+) cells. Enforced down-regulation of p53 levels either in HCT116 (p53+/+) cells by p53 RNAi treatment or in MCF-7 cells using shRNA for p53 (shp53) resulted in a remarkable increase in the MCAK protein level. Site-directed mutagenesis and ChIP analyses showed that p53-mediated repression of the MCAK core promoter activity was not directly exerted by p53-binding to putative p53-response elements (p53-RE1 at -173/-166 and p53-RE2 at -245/-238), but indirectly by attenuating Sp1 binding to GC-motifs (GC1 at -93/-84 and GC2 at -119/-110). Treatment of HEK-293 cells bearing the MCAK core promoter-reporter (pGL2-320-Luc) with mithramycin A, which down-regulates Sp1 gene expression, reduced the promoter activity as well as endogenous MCAK levels. Exposure of HCT116 (p53+/+) cells to nutlin-3a, a validated activator of p53, caused a simultaneous reduction in Sp1 and MCAK protein levels, but not in HCT116 (p53-/-) cells. In contrast to wild-type (wt)-p53, tumor-derived p53 mutants (p53V143A, p53R248W, and p53R273H) failed to repress the Sp1-dependent activation of the MCAK promoter and to down-regulate endogenous levels of Sp1 and MCAK proteins. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that p53 can repress MCAK promoter activity indirectly via down-regulation of Sp1 expression level, and suggest that MCAK elevation in human tumor cells might be due to p53 mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2773426773,"Sensorimotor dysfunction following incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) is often characterized by paralysis, spasticity and pain. Previously, we showed that intrathecal (i.t.) administration of the albumin-oleic acid (A-OA) complex in rats with SCI produced partial improvement of these symptoms and that oral 2-hydroxyoleic acid (HOA, a non-hydrolyzable OA analogue), was efficacious in the modulation and treatment of nociception and pain-related anxiety, respectively. Here we observed that intrathecal treatment with the complex albumin-HOA (A-HOA) every 3 days following T9 spinal contusion injury improved locomotor function assessed with the Rotarod and inhibited TA noxious reflex activity in Wistar rats. To investigate the mechanism of action of A-HOA, microarray analysis was carried out in the spinal cord lesion area. Representative genes involved in pain and neuroregeneration were selected to validate the changes observed in the microarray analysis by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Comparison of the expression between healthy rats, SCI rats, and SCI treated with A-HOA rats revealed relevant changes in the expression of genes associated with neuronal morphogenesis and growth, neuronal survival, pain and inflammation. Thus, treatment with A-HOA not only induced a significant overexpression of growth and differentiation factor 10 (GDF10), tenascin C (TNC), aspirin (ASPN) and sushi-repeat-containing X-linked 2 (SRPX2), but also a significant reduction in the expression of prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES) and phospholipases A1 and A2 (PLA1/2). Currently, SCI has very important unmet clinical needs. A-HOA downregulated genes involved with inflammation and upregulated genes involved in neuronal growth, and may serve to promote recovery of function after experimental SCI."
https://openalex.org/W2775637241,"Angiogenic factors are proteins that are related to certain foetal chromosomal abnormalities. The aim of this study was to determine the concentration of 60 angiogenic factors in the plasma of women with offspring possessing trisomy 21/Down syndrome (DS).After analysing karyotyping results, we selected 20 patients with foetuses possessing DS, and for the control group, we selected 28 healthy patients with uncomplicated pregnancies who delivered healthy newborns at term (i.e., 15-18 weeks of gestation). To assess the concentration of proteins in the blood plasma, we used a protein macroarray which enabled simultaneous determination of 60 angiogenic factors per sample.We observed a statistically significant increase in the concentration of these five angiogenic and inflammatory factors: TGFb1 (p = 0.039), angiostatin (p = 0.0142), I-309 (p = 0.0476), TGFb3 (p = 0.0395), and VEGF-D (p = 0.0173)-compared to concentrations in patients with healthy foetuses.Our findings suggest that angiogenic factors may play role in DS pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2775578470,"This study compares the presence of vitreous hyper-reflective dots (VHDs) detected with optical coherence tomography (OCT) between eyes with pseudophakic cystoid macular edema (CME) and those with no CME after cataract surgery. In addition, we evaluated the impact of VHDs on the responsiveness of pseudophakic CME to cortisone treatment.Department of Ophthalmology, Medical University of Graz, Austria.Retrospective, monocenter case-controlled study.Inclusion criteria for the study group and the control group were CME and no CME within 12 weeks following uneventful phacoemulsification in otherwise healthy eyes, respectively. VHDs (number and size) and the macular thickness were assessed with OCT. Furthermore, the number of peribulbar or intravitreal steroid injections was assessed.A total of 284 eyes from 267 patients were analyzed, among which 119 met the inclusion criteria for the study (n = 63) and the control group (n = 56). VHDs were observed in 54 (85.7%) study eyes and 21 (37.5%, p = 0.013) control eyes. The number of VHDs was 3.9±3.4 in the study group and 0.7±1 in the control group (p<0.001). The size of the VHDs was 33.5±9.1 μm and 36.6±17.9 μm in the study and control groups, respectively (p = 0.978). Overall, the number of VHDs correlated with central subfield thickness (r = 0.584, p<0.001), cube volume (r = 0.525, p<0.001), and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (r = -0.563, p<0.001). The number of VHDs did not correlate with the frequency of peribulbar or intravitreal steroid injections.VHDs occurred more often in eyes with CME than in eyes without CME following cataract surgery. In addition, the number of VHDs had an impact on the extent of macular thickening and subsequently postoperative BCVA. No correlation was found between the number of VHDs and the frequency of required peribulbar or intravitreal steroid injections."
https://openalex.org/W2773346794,"We observed that teneral adults (<1 h post-molt) of Cimex lectularius L. appeared more adept at climbing a smooth surface compared to sclerotized adults. Differences in climbing ability on a smooth surface based on sclerotization status were quantified by measuring the height to which bed bugs climbed when confined within a glass vial. The average maximum height climbed by teneral (T) bed bugs (n = 30, height climbed = 4.69 cm) differed significantly (P< 0.01) from recently sclerotized (RS) bed bugs (n = 30, height climbed = 1.73 cm at ~48 h post molt), sclerotized group 1 (S1) bed bugs (n = 30, S1 = 2.42 cm at >72 h), and sclerotized group 2 (S2) bed bugs (n = 30, height climbed = 2.64 cm at >72 h post molt). When heights from all climbing events were summed, teneral bed bugs (650.8 cm climbed) differed significantly (P< 0.01) from recently sclerotized (82 cm climbed) and sclerotized (group 1 = 104.6 cm climbed, group 2 = 107.8 cm climbed) bed bugs. These findings suggested that the external surface of teneral bed bug exoskeletons possess an adhesive property. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we found that adhesion force of an exoskeletal (presumably molting) fluid decreased almost five-fold from 88 to 17 nN within an hour of molting. Our findings may have implications for laboratory safety and the effectiveness of bed bug traps, barriers, and biomimetic-based adhesives."
