https://openalex.org/W1971707325,"Background Current management of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) is very effective; however, tumor recurrence with Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) and subsequent metastasis lead to poor survival outcome, suggesting that there is a dire need for novel mechanistic understanding of tumor recurrence, which would be critical for designing novel therapies. The recurrence and the metastasis of PCa are tightly linked with the biology of prostate cancer stem cells or cancer-initiating cells that is reminiscent of the acquisition of Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) phenotype. Increasing evidence suggests that EMT-type cells share many biological characteristics with cancer stem-like cells. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we found that PCa cells with EMT phenotype displayed stem-like cell features characterized by increased expression of Sox2, Nanog, Oct4, Lin28B and/or Notch1, consistent with enhanced clonogenic and sphere (prostasphere)-forming ability and tumorigenecity in mice, which was associated with decreased expression of miR-200 and/or let-7 family. Reversal of EMT by re-expression of miR-200 inhibited prostasphere-forming ability of EMT-type cells and reduced the expression of Notch1 and Lin28B. Down-regulation of Lin28B increased let-7 expression, which was consistent with repressed self-renewal capability. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that miR-200 played a pivotal role in linking the characteristics of cancer stem-like cells with EMT-like cell signatures in PCa. Selective elimination of cancer stem-like cells by reversing the EMT phenotype to Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition (MET) phenotype using novel agents would be useful for the prevention of tumor recurrence especially by eliminating those cells that are the “Root Cause” of tumor development and recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W1977781139,"Background Protection of the large intestine with its enormous amount of commensal bacteria is a challenge that became easier to understand when we recently could describe that colon has an inner attached mucus layer devoid of bacteria (Johansson et al. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 105, 15064–15069). The bacteria are thus kept at a distance from the epithelial cells and lack of this layer, as in Muc2-null mice, allow bacteria to contact the epithelium. This causes colitis and later on colon cancer, similar to the human disease Ulcerative Colitis, a disease that still lacks a pathogenetic explanation. Dextran Sulfate (DSS) in the drinking water is the most widely used animal model for experimental colitis. In this model, the inflammation is observed after 3–5 days, but early events explaining why DSS causes this has not been described. Principal Findings When mucus formed on top of colon explant cultures were exposed to 3% DSS, the thickness of the inner mucus layer decreased and became permeable to 2 µm fluorescent beads after 15 min. Both DSS and Dextran readily penetrated the mucus, but Dextran had no effect on thickness or permeability. When DSS was given in the drinking water to mice and the colon was stained for bacteria and the Muc2 mucin, bacteria were shown to penetrate the inner mucus layer and reach the epithelial cells already within 12 hours, long before any infiltration of inflammatory cells. Conclusion DSS thus causes quick alterations in the inner colon mucus layer that makes it permeable to bacteria. The bacteria that reach the epithelial cells probably trigger an inflammatory reaction. These observations suggest that altered properties or lack of the inner colon mucus layer may be an initial event in the development of colitis."
https://openalex.org/W1990945181,"Emerging infectious diseases are increasingly cited as threats to wildlife, livestock and humans alike. They can threaten geographically isolated or critically endangered wildlife populations; however, relatively few studies have clearly demonstrated the extent to which emerging diseases can impact populations of common wildlife species. Here, we report the impact of an emerging protozoal disease on British populations of greenfinch Carduelis chloris and chaffinch Fringilla coelebs, two of the most common birds in Britain. Morphological and molecular analyses showed this to be due to Trichomonas gallinae. Trichomonosis emerged as a novel fatal disease of finches in Britain in 2005 and rapidly became epidemic within greenfinch, and to a lesser extent chaffinch, populations in 2006. By 2007, breeding populations of greenfinches and chaffinches in the geographic region of highest disease incidence had decreased by 35% and 21% respectively, representing mortality in excess of half a million birds. In contrast, declines were less pronounced or absent in these species in regions where the disease was found in intermediate or low incidence. Also, populations of dunnock Prunella modularis, which similarly feeds in gardens, but in which T. gallinae was rarely recorded, did not decline. This is the first trichomonosis epidemic reported in the scientific literature to negatively impact populations of free-ranging non-columbiform species, and such levels of mortality and decline due to an emerging infectious disease are unprecedented in British wild bird populations. This disease emergence event demonstrates the potential for a protozoan parasite to jump avian host taxonomic groups with dramatic effect over a short time period."
https://openalex.org/W2037362692,"Shared genetic and environmental risk factors have been identified for autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia. Social interaction, communication, emotion processing, sensorimotor gating and executive function are disrupted in both, stimulating debate about whether these are related conditions. Brain imaging studies constitute an informative and expanding resource to determine whether brain structural phenotype of these disorders is distinct or overlapping. We aimed to synthesize existing datasets characterizing ASD and schizophrenia within a common framework, to quantify their structural similarities. In a novel modification of Anatomical Likelihood Estimation (ALE), 313 foci were extracted from 25 voxel-based studies comprising 660 participants (308 ASD, 352 first-episode schizophrenia) and 801 controls. The results revealed that, compared to controls, lower grey matter volumes within limbic-striato-thalamic circuitry were common to ASD and schizophrenia. Unique features of each disorder included lower grey matter volume in amygdala, caudate, frontal and medial gyrus for schizophrenia and putamen for autism. Thus, in terms of brain volumetrics, ASD and schizophrenia have a clear degree of overlap that may reflect shared etiological mechanisms. However, the distinctive neuroanatomy also mapped in each condition raises the question about how this is arrived in the context of common etiological pressures."
https://openalex.org/W2055185462,"Background Trans-splicing, the in vivo joining of two independently transcribed RNA molecules, is well characterized in lower eukaryotes, but was long thought absent from metazoans. However, recent bioinformatic analyses of EST sequences suggested widespread trans-splicing in mammals. These apparently spliced transcripts generally lacked canonical splice sites, leading us to question their authenticity. Particularly, the native ability of reverse transcriptase enzymes to template switch during transcription could produce apparently trans-spliced sequences. Principal Findings Here we report an in vitro system for the analysis of template switching in reverse transcription. Using highly purified RNA substrates, we show the reproducible occurrence of apparent trans-splicing between two RNA molecules. Other reported non-canonical splicing events such as exon shuffling and sense-antisense fusions were also readily detected. The latter caused the production of apparent antisense non-coding RNAs, which are also reported to be abundant in humans. Conclusions We propose that most reported examples of non-canonical splicing in metazoans arise through template switching by reverse transcriptase during cDNA preparation. We further show that the products of template switching can vary between reverse transcriptases, providing a simple diagnostic for identifying many of these experimental artifacts."
https://openalex.org/W1973843193,"Background A substantial decline in malaria was reported to have occurred over several years until 2007 in the western part of The Gambia, encouraging consideration of future elimination in this previously highly endemic region. Scale up of interventions has since increased with support from the Global Fund and other donors. Methodology/Principal Findings We continued to examine laboratory records at four health facilities previously studied and investigated six additional facilities for a 7 year period, adding data from 243,707 slide examinations, to determine trends throughout the country until the end of 2009. We actively detected infections in a community cohort of 800 children living in rural villages throughout the 2008 malaria season, and assayed serological changes in another rural population between 2006 and 2009. Proportions of malaria positive slides declined significantly at all of the 10 health facilities between 2003 (annual mean across all sites, 38.7%) and 2009 (annual mean, 7.9%). Statistical modelling of trends confirmed significant seasonality and decline over time at each facility. Slide positivity was lowest in 2009 at all sites, except two where lowest levels were observed in 2006. Mapping households of cases presenting at the latter sites in 2007–2009 indicated that these were not restricted to a few residual foci. Only 2.8% (22/800) of a rural cohort of children had a malaria episode in the 2008 season, and there was substantial serological decline between 2006 and 2009 in a separate rural area. Conclusions Malaria has continued to decline in The Gambia, as indicated by a downward trend in slide positivity at health facilities, and unprecedented low incidence and seroprevalence in community surveys. We recommend intensification of control interventions for several years to further reduce incidence, prior to considering an elimination programme."
https://openalex.org/W2006433340,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA gyrase, an indispensable nanomachine involved in the regulation of DNA topology, is the only type II topoisomerase present in this organism and is hence the sole target for quinolone action, a crucial drug active against multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. To understand at an atomic level the quinolone resistance mechanism, which emerges in extensively drug resistant tuberculosis, we performed combined functional, biophysical and structural studies of the two individual domains constituting the catalytic DNA gyrase reaction core, namely the Toprim and the breakage-reunion domains. This allowed us to produce a model of the catalytic reaction core in complex with DNA and a quinolone molecule, identifying original mechanistic properties of quinolone binding and clarifying the relationships between amino acid mutations and resistance phenotype of M. tuberculosis DNA gyrase. These results are compatible with our previous studies on quinolone resistance. Interestingly, the structure of the entire breakage-reunion domain revealed a new interaction, in which the Quinolone-Binding Pocket (QBP) is blocked by the N-terminal helix of a symmetry-related molecule. This interaction provides useful starting points for designing peptide based inhibitors that target DNA gyrase to prevent its binding to DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2083426418,"Mitoquinone (MitoQ) is a synthetically modified, redox-active ubiquinone compound that accumulates predominantly in mitochondria. We found that MitoQ is 30-fold more cytotoxic to breast cancer cells than to healthy mammary cells. MitoQ treatment led to irreversible inhibition of clonogenic growth of breast cancer cells through a combination of autophagy and apoptotic cell death mechanisms. Relatively limited cytotoxicity was seen with the parent ubiquinone coenzyme Q10. Inhibition of cancer cell growth by MitoQ was associated with G1/S cell cycle arrest and phosphorylation of the checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2. The possible role of oxidative stress in MitoQ activity was investigated by measuring the products of hydroethidine oxidation. Increases in ethidium and dihydroethidium levels, markers of one-electron oxidation of hydroethidine, were observed at cytotoxic concentrations of MitoQ. Keap1, an oxidative stress sensor protein that regulates the antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2, underwent oxidation, degradation, and dissociation from Nrf2 in MitoQ-treated cells. Nrf2 protein levels, nuclear localization, and transcriptional activity also increased following MitoQ treatment. Knockdown of Nrf2 caused a 2-fold increase in autophagy and an increase in G1 cell cycle arrest in response to MitoQ but had no apparent effect on apoptosis. The Nrf2-regulated enzyme NQO1 is partly responsible for controlling the level of autophagy. Keap1 and Nrf2 act as redox sensors for oxidative perturbations that lead to autophagy. MitoQ and similar compounds should be further evaluated for novel anticancer activity.

MitoQ and similar compounds should be further evaluated for novel anticancer activity. Mitochondria are central to many cellular processes, including energy production and apoptosis. A by-product of electron transfer in the mitochondria is the formation of superoxide. When superoxide is not rapidly detoxified, there is higher likelihood for generation of additional oxidants in mitochondria, leading to oxidative damage. Hence, targeting the mitochondria with agents capable of scavenging oxidants is an attractive cytoprotective strategy (1Murphy M.P. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 326-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Conjugation with a cationic triphenylphosphonium moiety is a method for targeting therapeutic molecules to the mitochondria (2Murphy M.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1028-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar).

It is derived from the mitochondrial respiratory chain component ubiquinone (3Kalivendi S.V. Konorev E.A. Cunningham S. Vanamala S.K. Kaji E.H. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Biochem.

The ubiquinone moiety is covalently linked by an aliphatic 10-carbon chain to a triphenylphosphonium cation. As a lipophilic cation, it can pass easily through lipid bilayers. Driven by the large membrane potential in the mitochondria, it selectively accumulates in the mitochondria. MitoQ is orally active and is being pursued as a potential therapy in degenerative conditions, such as Parkinson disease (2Murphy M.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1028-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Although initially designed as an antioxidant, mitochondrial redox cycling of mitoquinone has been shown to lead to superoxide production and apoptotic cell death (6Doughan A.K. Dikalov S.I.

Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) is a major transcription factor for antioxidant response element (ARE)-dependent gene transcription in response to agents that cause oxidative stress (including by the quinone oxidant tBHQ) (8Kobayashi M. Li L. Iwamoto N. Nakajima-Takagi Y. Kaneko H. Nakayama Y. Eguchi M. Wada Y. Kumagai Y. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Nrf2 is critical in the regulation of antioxidant and cytoprotective genes. In the absence of oxidative stress, Nrf2 is sequestered within the cytosol by its inhibitory partner and principle regulator, Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1). Nrf2 activity is normally limited by Keap1, which constitutively facilitates ubiquitination of Nrf2 and causes its ongoing proteasomal degradation (9Zhang D.D. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8137-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Keap1 can act as a sensor for oxidative stress due to its highly reactive cysteine residues. In vitro, in the presence of free radicals, Nrf2 is released from Keap1 and translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to the ARE and activates gene expression. One such Nrf2-regulated gene is NQO1 (NAD(P)H:quinine oxidoreductase 1). NQO1 is a cytoprotective flavoprotein that catalyzes the two-electron reduction of various quinones and redox dyes (10Jaiswal A.K. McBride O.W. Adesnik M. Nebert D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13572-13578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and signaling in cancer cells is complex and controversial (11Gogvadze V. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18: 165-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 12Warburg O. Science. 1956; 124: 269-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cancer cells have a greater mitochondrial membrane potential than healthy cells (13Armstrong J.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 147: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Rhodamine 123, a lipophilic cationic probe, selectively accumulates in the mitochondria and consequently induces greater toxicity in cancer cells (14Bernal S.D. Lampidis T.J. Summerhayes I.C. Chen L.B. Science. 1982; 218: 1117-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 15Davis S. Weiss M.J. Wong J.R. Lampidis T.J. Chen L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13844-13850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, we found that mitoquinone has significant and selective anticancer activity, unlike untargeted ubiquinone (CoQ10). Here, we demonstrate that the Nrf2-Keap1 proteins act as redox sensors that relay the signal for a failed cytoprotective response to MitoQ. Data are provided to elucidate the cellular response to MitoQ and to determine its novel underlying mechanism of action. A new method was developed to synthesize MitoQ starting from the commercially available idebenone (see scheme in supplemental Fig. 1). Idebenone (3.38 g, 0.01 mol) was stirred in 50 ml of dichloromethane containing triethylamine (2 g, 0.02 mol) in an ice bath. To this mixture, methanesulfonyl chloride (2.24 g, 0.02 mol) in 20 ml of dichloromethane was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred on ice for 1 h, and the solution was shaken with 1 m HCl until washings became acidic. The solution was dried, and solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator. The orange semisolid was chromatographed on a silica gel column, and the orange band was eluted with ether-hexane (1:1) solvent. Homogeneous fractions were combined, and solvent was subsequently removed to obtain an orange solid. The yield was almost quantitative. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel plates showed a single spot. The methane sulfonyl ester was dissolved in 50 ml of dry acetone, and lithium bromide (1.75 g, 0.02 mol) was added and stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The solvent acetone was removed by evaporation, and the product was extracted with 50 ml of ether. The ether extract was washed with water (2 × 25 ml), the orange solution was dried, and solvent was removed. The compound was purified by silica gel column chromatography, and the bromoderivative of idebenone was eluted with ether/hexane (1:1). Homogeneous fractions were combined, and solvent was removed to get an orange solid. The yield was 3.56 g (89%). TLC in ether/hexane solvent showed a single spot that moved ahead of the starting methanesulfonyl ester. The bromoderivative was reduced with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) to the corresponding quinol. The bromoderivative was dissolved in 50 ml methanol, and sodium borohydride (1.5 g, 0.04 mol) was slowly added in small aliquots with stirring. After the addition, stirring was continued for an additional 30 min, and the colorless solution was acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid and extracted with 50 ml of chloroform. The organic layer was dried, solvent was removed by blowing nitrogen gas, and the volatiles were removed by vacuum. The resulting colorless oil (quinol) was immediately used in the next step to prevent further oxidation in air to the corresponding quinone. In 25 ml of dioxane, triphenylphosphene (3.9 g, 0.015 mol) was added to the quinol and kept refluxed under a nitrogen atmosphere for 48 h. The solvent was partially removed by rotary evaporation, and 50 ml of ether was added with stirring. The precipitated product was collected by decantation, and the residual ether was removed by blowing nitrogen gas. The semisolid product was dissolved in 5 ml of dichloromethane and added to the solution in drops to 50 ml of ether with stirring. The precipitated product was collected as before by decantation. The dried product was dissolved in dichloromethane and precipitated from ether, and this process was repeated four times. The purified product consisted of mitoquinol with trace amounts of the oxidized compound mitoquinone. The product was dissolved in 50 ml of ethanol and was gently bubbled with air for 24 h to allow complete oxidation of mitoquinol to mitoquinone. The final quantity of mitoquinone was 3.1 g with an overall yield of 47%. The purity was confirmed by HPLC and LC/MS (mass = 583). Doxorubicin was provided by NCI-Frederick, National Institutes of Health. Co-enzyme Q10, acridine orange, bafilomycin A, pepstatin, E64d, tBHQ, rapamycin, and propidium iodide (PI) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Recombinant human TRAIL was generously provided by Dr. Baolin Zhang (Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, MD). MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium. MCF-12A healthy human mammary epithelial cells were obtained from BioWhittaker Clonetics (Walkersville, MD) and maintained in mammary epithelial cell growth medium (16Hoke E.M. Maylock C.A.

MDA-MB-231 cells were stably transfected with a CMV-driven NQO1 cDNA (MDA-MB-231-NQO1-positive) or the pcDNA3 vector alone (MDA-MB-231-NQO1-negative). Control experiments were performed to confirm the NQO1 levels (see Fig. 7A, inset). Cell survival was determined using a colony formation assay after the indicated treatments for 6 h and replating for 7 days followed by washing, fixation, and staining with Wright's Giemsa stain (Sigma) (18Rao V.A. Agama K. Holbeck S. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9971-9979Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Colonies were counted using a light microscope and triplicate samples from each experiment. Colonies with greater than 30 cells each were counted. Growth inhibition was assessed by the sulforhodamine B (SRB; Sigma-Aldrich) assay as described previously (18Rao V.A. Agama K. Holbeck S. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9971-9979Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). GI50 values were calculated using Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). For cell cycle analyses, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and stained with PI after treatment with 5 μg/ml RNase A. Cells were analyzed by a FACSCaliber flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and cell cycle phases were quantitated using the CellQuest program. For apoptosis analyses, cells were stained with annexin V and PI (16Hoke E.M. Maylock C.A. Shacter E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 39: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Both floating and attached cells were collected for FACS analyses. Transmission electron microscopy analysis was carried out using either high pressure freezing/freeze substitution or chemical fixation/resin flat embedding as described previously (19McDonald K.L. Morphew M. Verkade P. Müller-Reichert T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 143-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Autophagosomes were identified and counted with a fluorescence microscope using a 40× objective. Autophagosomes were identified from the phase-contrast image using the intracellular structure images obtained by electron microscopy for comparison. A representative example is provided below the graph in Fig. 3D. The percentage of cells with autophagosomes was quantitated by counting cells that stained orange after treatment with acridine orange to stain the acidic vesicular organelles (see supplemental Fig. 2) (20Chen Y. Azad M.B. Gibson S.B. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2010; 88: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with the lipophilic cationic probe 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) (Molecular Probes) (5 μg/ml) and assayed using a fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices) with the following settings: excitation at 485 nm, emission at 540 and 590 nm. ΔΨm was calculated using the ratio of 590 nm (aggregates)/540 nm (monomeric form). The procedures for lysate preparation, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting were performed as reported previously (18Rao V.A. Agama K. Holbeck S. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9971-9979Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Zhang D.D. Lo S.C. Cross J.V. Templeton D.J. Hannink M. Mol. Cell.

Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8137-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). After the indicated treatments, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). Whole cell protein samples were electrophoresed using a 4–12% BisTris gel in the presence or absence of reducing agent (β-mercaptoethanol). Following transfer, the Immobilon-P membrane was probed with anti-Keap1 antibody (generously provided by Dr. Mark Hannink, University of Missouri (Columbia, MO)) (9Zhang D.D. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8137-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). The slower migrating form of Keap1 (68 kDa) was detected at >120 kDa only under non-reducing conditions. Slides were prepared as described previously (22Rao V.A. Fan A.M. Meng L. Doe C.F. North P.S. Hickson I.D. Pommier Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8925-8937Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Antibodies for phospho-Chk1-Ser317, phospho-Chk1-Ser345, and phospho-Chk2-Thr68 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Antibody for Nrf2 was obtained from Abcam. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed with a Ziess LSM510 confocal system (Carl Ziess Microimaging, Thornwood, NY). For the detection of superoxide and/or other reactive oxygen species (ROS), cells were incubated in DMEM with 2% FBS and treated with 10 μm HE during the last 30 min of incubation with MitoQ. After the incubation, the cells were processed and analyzed by HPLC with electrochemical detection, as described previously (23Zielonka J. Hardy M. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 46: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from MDA-MB-231 cells using the nuclear extract kit by Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). The presence of nucleophosmin and absence of GAPDH protein were used as a measure of the purity of nuclear extracts. An ELISA-based assay consisting of an immobilized oligonucleotide containing the ARE consensus binding site (5′-GTCACAGTGACTCAGCAGAATCTG-3′) was used to measure Nrf2 DNA binding activity (TransAM kits, Active Motif, catalog no. 50296). Nrf2 from 2.5 μg of nuclear extract/sample was allowed to bind to the ARE on the 96-well plates. A primary antibody against Nrf2 was then used to detect bound Nrf2. A secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) provided a colorimetric readout at 450 nm. Nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with Nrf2 were included as the positive control. For siRNA experiments, MDA-MB-231 cells were plated in medium lacking antibiotic. After 24 h, the medium was replaced, and 100 nm Nrf2 ON-TARGETplus SMARTPOOL (catalog no. L-003755-00) or ON-TARGETplus non-coding siRNA (catalog no. D-001810-0105) (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL) was transfected using DharmaFECT 1 transfection reagent as described by the manufacturer. Data shown are representative of at least three independent experiments, unless noted otherwise. Error bars on graphs in all figures denote S.D. values. Student's t test was used to ascertain statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). The growth-inhibitory activity of MitoQ was tested in the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 and in MCF12A primary mammary epithelial cells using the SRB dye assay (Fig. 1A, left). The effects of MitoQ were compared with untargeted CoQ10 in the same cell lines (Fig. 1A, right). Breast cancer cell lines were more sensitive to MitoQ than healthy mammary cells. The GI50 values for MitoQ in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and MCF12A cell lines were 296 nm, 113 nm, and >10 μm, respectively. In contrast, the GI50 values for CoQ10 in these cells were 8.2 μm (MDA-MB-231) and >10 μm (for MCF-7 and MCF-12A). Thus, MitoQ exhibits selective antiproliferative effects in breast cancer cells as compared with healthy mammary cells. One of the hallmark traits of cancer cells is their ability to undergo isolated clonal growth. Results obtained from the SRB growth inhibition assay were confirmed using a colony formation assay for cancer cell killing (Fig. 1B). MDA-MB-231 cells were exposed to MitoQ for 6 h, followed by removal of media and replating. MDA-MB-231 cells were evaluated for their colony formation ability for up to 7 days in drug-free media. MitoQ elicited a dose-dependent decrease in clonogenic growth. To better understand the mechanism of cytotoxicity by MitoQ, we analyzed the cell cycle and apoptosis profile of MDA-MB-231 cells following drug exposure at 48 h (Fig. 1C). MitoQ arrested MDA-MB-231 cells in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. Compared with control cells, the percentage of G1 cells increased from 46.8% to 50.6 and 68.2% after exposure to 0.1 and 1 μm MitoQ, respectively. A concentration-dependent increase in sub-G1 DNA-containing cells, indicative of apoptosis, was also detected. With 1 μm MitoQ, 10.8% of cells were apoptotic compared with 1.6% in control cells. The cell cycle arrest by MitoQ was compared with that by the untargeted ubiquinone, CoQ10. In contrast to MitoQ, 1 μm CoQ10 produced a smaller G1/S phase arrest and produced significantly fewer sub-G1 DNA-containing cells (2.9%) (Fig. 1C). To determine the mechanism by which MDA-MB-231 cells undergo G1/S cell cycle arrest, we assayed the phosphorylation of cell cycle checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2. These proteins help maintain the cell cycle checkpoint and may also promote apoptosis (24Hirao A. Cheung A. Duncan G. Girard P.M. Elia A.J. Wakeham A. Okada H. Sarkissian T. Wong J.A. Sakai T. De Stanchina E. Bristow R.G. Suda T. Lowe S.W. Jeggo P.A. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6521-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) via a complex network of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation events (25Niida H. Katsuno Y. Banerjee B. Hande M.P. Nakanishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2572-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to 0.1 μm MitoQ showed significant phosphorylation of phospho-Chk1-Ser317, phospho-Chk1-Ser345, and phospho-Chk2-Thr68 (Fig. 1D). Doxorubicin served as a positive control. The data show that MitoQ causes cell cycle arrest and checkpoint kinase activation in cancer cells. Although 40–60% of the cells underwent growth inhibition (Fig. 1A) with 1 μm MitoQ, this did not appear to translate into apoptotic events (∼11%, as indicated by the number of sub-G1 DNA-containing cells). We performed FACS analysis of annexin V-PI staining of live cells treated with 1 μm MitoQ (Fig. 2A) to further quantify apoptosis. A time course study with MitoQ showed no appreciable apoptosis prior to 24 h. Following treatment with MitoQ for 48 and 72 h, 21.8 and 28.8% of cells were annexin V-positive compared with 3% in control cells. Comparable results were obtained using Hoechst-PI staining to quantify apoptosis (not shown). We conclude that apoptosis only accounts for part of the mechanism by which MitoQ elicits its anticancer growth inhibition. To test whether apoptosis by MitoQ was dependent on caspases, we pretreated cells with 10 μm benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone for 30 min followed by MitoQ for 48 h (Fig. 2B). Pretreatment with benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone did not appreciably lower the total percentage of annexin V-positive cells (18.6% compared with 22.4%). Cells treated with recombinant human TRAIL (10 ng/ml for 16 h) were used as positive control for caspase-dependent apoptosis and showed abrogation of apoptosis in the presence of benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone. We also found no significant difference in the percentage of MitoQ-induced annexin V-positive cells in MCF7 cells, which lack caspase-3 (Fig. 2C). Hence, we conclude that MitoQ-induced apoptosis is not caspase-dependent. To determine whether MitoQ causes disruption of the mitochondrial membrane, we studied the mitochondrial membrane potential in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells after drug exposure. Conversion of red fluorescent aggregates to green fluorescent monomers of the JC-1 dye upon membrane depolarization marks changes in membrane potential. Exposure of cells to MitoQ (0.1 and 1 μm) led to a rapid membrane depolarization within 60 min of exposure (Fig. 2D). Membrane depolarization appeared to be sustained for up to 24 h after drug exposure. In contrast to MitoQ, CoQ10 did not exhibit any appreciable effect at comparable concentrations. VP-16 was included as a positive control (26Facompré M. Wattez N. Kluza J. Lansiaux A. Bailly C. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 4: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Next, the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol was measured as an indicator of mitochondrial damage after MitoQ treatment (1 μm). A distinct increase in cytosolic cytochrome c protein levels was observed at 6 h (Fig. 2E). Thus, MitoQ exposure is accompanied by a rapid membrane depolarization and cytochrome c release that may be partly responsible for the apoptosis induced in breast cancer cells. Our findings indicate that apoptosis may not be the major mechanism responsible for the antiproliferative activity of MitoQ. We therefore hypothesized that MitoQ may induce autophagy that leads to inhibition of proliferation. Autophagy is one of the consequences of stressing cells, and it is emerging as an important mechanism to explain drug responses in cancer cells (27Gao M. Yeh P.Y. Lu Y.S. Hsu C.H. Chen K.F. Lee W.C.

Autophagosomes were observed after 24 h of incubation with 1 μm MitoQ (Fig. 3A). The presence of mitochondria within the autophagic vacuole (“mitophagy”) was also noted (labeled by arrowheads) (32Kim I. Rodriguez-Enriquez S. Lemasters J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 462: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Mitophagy is a potential mechanism for turnover of dysfunctional mitochondria, in agreement with the rapid membrane depolarization and cytochrome c release (Fig. 2D) (32Kim I. Rodriguez-Enriquez S.

https://openalex.org/W2155578830,"The bacterial luciferase (lux) gene cassette consists of five genes (luxCDABE) whose protein products synergistically generate bioluminescent light signals exclusive of supplementary substrate additions or exogenous manipulations. Historically expressible only in prokaryotes, the lux operon was re-synthesized through a process of multi-bicistronic, codon-optimization to demonstrate for the first time self-directed bioluminescence emission in a mammalian HEK293 cell line in vitro and in vivo.Autonomous in vitro light production was shown to be 12-fold greater than the observable background associated with untransfected control cells. The availability of reduced riboflavin phosphate (FMNH(2)) was identified as the limiting bioluminescence substrate in the mammalian cell environment even after the addition of a constitutively expressed flavin reductase gene (frp) from Vibrio harveyi. FMNH(2) supplementation led to a 151-fold increase in bioluminescence in cells expressing mammalian codon-optimized luxCDE and frp genes. When injected subcutaneously into nude mice, in vivo optical imaging permitted near instantaneous light detection that persisted independently for the 60 min length of the assay with negligible background.The speed, longevity, and self-sufficiency of lux expression in the mammalian cellular environment provides a viable and powerful alternative for real-time target visualization not currently offered by existing bioluminescent and fluorescent imaging technologies."
https://openalex.org/W2087136724,"Background The enthesis, which attaches the tendon to the bone, naturally disappears with aging, thus limiting joint mobility. Surgery is frequently needed but the clinical outcome is often poor due to the decreased natural healing capacity of the elderly. This study explored the benefits of a treatment based on injecting chondrocyte and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in a new rat model of degenerative enthesis repair. Methodology The Achilles' tendon was cut and the enthesis destroyed. The damage was repaired by classical surgery without cell injection (group G1, n = 52) and with chondrocyte (group G2, n = 51) or MSC injection (group G3, n = 39). The healing rate was determined macroscopically 15, 30 and 45 days later. The production and organization of a new enthesis was assessed by histological scoring of collagen II immunostaining, glycoaminoglycan production and the presence of columnar chondrocytes. The biomechanical load required to rupture the bone-tendon junction was determined. Principal Findings The spontaneous healing rate in the G1 control group was 40%, close to those observed in humans. Cell injection significantly improved healing (69%, p = 0.0028 for G2 and p = 0.006 for G3) and the load-to-failure after 45 days (p<0.05) over controls. A new enthesis was clearly produced in cell-injected G2 and G3 rats, but not in the controls. Only the MSC-injected G3 rats had an organized enthesis with columnar chondrocytes as in a native enthesis 45 days after surgery. Conclusions Cell therapy is an efficient procedure for reconstructing degenerative entheses. MSC treatment produced better organ regeneration than chondrocyte treatment. The morphological and biomechanical properties were similar to those of a native enthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2012528744,"Background In a cross-sectional study we studied the fasting serum DPP-4 enzymatic activity (sDPP-4) and the insulin resistance index (HOMA2-IR) in gliptin naïve patients with type 2 diabetes and in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and in healthy controls (CNTRL). Methods and Findings sDPP-4 was measured by kinetic assay in 39 NAFLD (F/M:19/20, mean age: 47.42 yrs) and 82 type 2 diabetes (F/M:48/34, 62.8 yrs) patients and 26 (F/M:14/12, 35.3 yrs) controls. Definition of T2D group as patients with type 2 diabetes but without clinically obvious liver disease created non-overlapping study groups. Diagnosis of NAFLD was based on ultrasonography and the exclusion of other etiololgy. Patients in T2D and NAFLD groups were similarly obese. 75 g CH OGTT in 39 NAFLD patients: 24-NGT, 4-IGT or IFG (“prediabetes”), 11-type 2 diabetes. HOMA2-IR: CNTRL: 1.44; T2D-group: 2.62 (p = 0.046 vs CNTRL, parametric tests); NAFLD(NGTonly): 3.23 (p = 0.0013 vs CNTRL); NAFLD(IFG/IGT/type 2 diabetes): 3.82 (p<0.001 vs CNTRL, p = 0.049 vs 2TD group). sDPP-4 activity was higher in NAFLD both with NGT (mean:33.08U/L) and abnormal glucose metabolism (30.38U/L) than in CNTRL (25.89U/L, p<0.001 and p = 0.013) or in T2D groups (23.97U/L, p<0.001 and p = 0.004). Correlations in NAFLD among sDPP-4 and ALT: r = 0.4637,p = 0.0038 and γGT: r = 0.4991,p = 0.0017 and HOMA2-IR: r = 0.5295,p = 0.0026 and among HOMA2-IR and ALT: r = 0.4340,p = 0.0147 and γGT: r = 0.4128,p = 0.0210. Conclusions The fasting serum DPP-4 activity was not increased in T2D provided that patients with liver disease were intentionally excluded. The high serum DPP-4 activities in NAFLD were correlated with liver tests but not with the fasting plasma glucose or HbA1C supporting that the excess is of hepatic origin and it might contribute to the speedup of metabolic deterioration. The correlation among γGT, ALT and serum DPP-4 activity and also between serum DPP-4 activity and HOMA2-IR in NAFLD strongly suggests that serum DPP-4 activity should be considered as a novel liver disease biomarker."
https://openalex.org/W2091408822,"Background Paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) is a devastating autoimmune blistering disease, involving mucocutaneous and internal organs, and associated with underlying neoplasms. PNP is characterized by the production of autoantibodies targeting proteins of the plakin and cadherin families involved in maintenance of cell architecture and tissue cohesion. Nevertheless, the identity of an antigen of Mr 170,000 (p170), thought to be critical in PNP pathogenesis, has remained unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Using an immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry based approach, we identified p170 as alpha-2-macroglobuline-like-1, a broad range protease inhibitor expressed in stratified epithelia and other tissues damaged in the PNP disease course. We demonstrate that 10 PNP sera recognize alpha-2-macroglobuline-like-1 (A2ML1), while none of the control sera obtained from patients with bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus foliaceus and normal subjects does. Conclusions/Significance Our study unravels a broad range protease inhibitor as a new class of target antigens in a paraneoplastic autoimmune multiorgan syndrome and opens a new challenging investigation avenue for a better understanding of PNP pathogenesis."

High-resolution molecular studies are needed to definitively ascertain whether gut microbial communities are distinct in milk-fed and formula-fed infants.Pyrosequencing-based whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to evaluate community wide gut microbial gene expression in 21 day old neonatal piglets fed either with sow's milk (mother fed, MF; n = 4) or with artificial formula (formula fed, FF; n = 4). Microbial DNA and RNA were harvested from cecal contents for each animal. cDNA libraries and 16S rDNA amplicons were sequenced on the Roche 454 GS-FLX Titanium system. Communities were similar at the level of phylum but were dissimilar at the level of genus; Prevotella was the dominant genus within MF samples and Bacteroides was most abundant within FF samples. Screened cDNA sequences were assigned functional annotations by the MG-RAST annotation pipeline and based upon best-BLASTX-hits to the NCBI COG database. Patterns of gene expression were very similar in MF and FF animals. All samples were enriched with transcripts encoding enzymes for carbohydrate and protein metabolism, as well as proteins involved in stress response, binding to host epithelium, and lipopolysaccharide metabolism. Carbohydrate utilization transcripts were generally similar in both groups. The abundance of enzymes involved in several pathways related to amino acid metabolism (e.g., arginine metabolism) and oxidative stress response differed in MF and FF animals.Abundant transcripts identified in this study likely contribute to a core microbial metatranscriptome in the distal intestine. Although microbial community gene expression was generally similar in the cecal contents of MF and FF neonatal piglets, several differentially abundant gene clusters were identified. Further investigations of gut microbial gene expression will contribute to a better understanding of normal and abnormal enteric microbiology in animals and humans."
https://openalex.org/W2097082069,"Historically, management of infants with fever without localizing signs (FWLS) has generated much controversy, with attempts to risk stratify based on several criteria. Advances in medical practice may have altered the epidemiology of serious bacterial infections (SBIs) in this population. We conducted this study to test the hypothesis that the rate of SBIs in this patient population has changed over time.We performed a retrospective review of all infants meeting FWLS criteria at our institution from 1997-2006. We examined all clinical and outcome data and performed statistical analysis of SBI rates and ampicillin resistance rates.668 infants met criteria for FWLS. The overall rate of SBIs was 10.8%, with a significant increase from 2002-2006 (52/361, 14.4%) compared to 1997-2001 (20/307, 6.5%) (p = 0.001). This increase was driven by an increase in E. coli urinary tract infections (UTI), particularly in older infants (31-90 days).We observed a significant increase in E. coli UTI among FWLS infants with high rates of ampicillin resistance. The reasons are likely to be multifactorial, but the results themselves emphasize the need to examine urine in all febrile infants <90 days and consider local resistance patterns when choosing empiric antibiotics."

We propose a novel approach for publishing interactive phylogenetic trees.We present a javascript library, jsPhyloSVG, which facilitates constructing interactive phylogenetic trees from raw Newick or phyloXML formats directly within the browser in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format. It is designed to work across all major browsers and renders an alternative format for those browsers that do not support SVG. The library provides tools for building rectangular and circular phylograms with integrated charting. Interactive features may be integrated and made to respond to events such as clicks on any element of the tree, including labels.jsPhyloSVG is an open-source solution for rendering dynamic phylogenetic trees. It is capable of generating complex and interactive phylogenetic trees across all major browsers without the need for plugins. It is novel in supporting the ability to interpret the tree inference formats directly, exposing the underlying markup to data-mining services.

https://openalex.org/W2140893882,"Dietary selenium is known to protect skin against UV-induced damage and cancer and its topical application improves skin surface parameters in humans, while selenium deficiency compromises protective antioxidant enzymes in skin. Furthermore, skin and hair abnormalities in humans and rodents may be caused by selenium deficiency, which are overcome by dietary selenium supplementation. Most important biological functions of selenium are attributed to selenoproteins, proteins containing selenium in the form of the amino acid, selenocysteine (Sec). Sec insertion into proteins depends on Sec tRNA; thus, knocking out the Sec tRNA gene (Trsp) ablates selenoprotein expression. We generated mice with targeted removal of selenoproteins in keratin 14 (K14) expressing cells and their differentiated descendents. The knockout progeny had a runt phenotype, developed skin abnormalities and experienced premature death. Lack of selenoproteins in epidermal cells led to the development of hyperplastic epidermis and aberrant hair follicle morphogenesis, accompanied by progressive alopecia after birth. Further analyses revealed that selenoproteins are essential antioxidants in skin and unveiled their role in keratinocyte growth and viability. This study links severe selenoprotein deficiency to abnormalities in skin and hair and provides genetic evidence for the role of these proteins in keratinocyte function and cutaneous development."

https://openalex.org/W2028468016,"Base excision repair (BER) is a DNA repair pathway designed to correct small base lesions in genomic DNA. While DNA polymerase beta (pol β) is known to be the main polymerase in the BER pathway, various studies have implicated other DNA polymerases in back-up roles. One such polymerase, DNA polymerase lambda (pol λ), was shown to be important in BER of oxidative DNA damage. To further explore roles of the X-family DNA polymerases λ and β in BER, we prepared a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line with deletions in the genes for both pol β and pol λ. Neutral red viability assays demonstrated that pol λ and pol β double null cells were hypersensitive to alkylating and oxidizing DNA damaging agents. In vitro BER assays revealed a modest contribution of pol λ to single-nucleotide BER of base lesions. Additionally, using co-immunoprecipitation experiments with purified enzymes and whole cell extracts, we found that both pol λ and pol β interact with the upstream DNA glycosylases for repair of alkylated and oxidized DNA bases. Such interactions could be important in coordinating roles of these polymerases during BER."
https://openalex.org/W2039405357,"The myelin sheaths that surround the thick axons of the peripheral nervous system are produced by the highly specialized Schwann cells. Differentiation of Schwann cells and myelination occur in discrete steps. Each of these requires coordinated expression of specific proteins in a precise sequence, yet the regulatory mechanisms controlling protein expression during these events are incompletely understood. Here we report that Schwann cell-specific ablation of the enzyme Dicer1, which is required for the production of small non-coding regulatory microRNAs, fully arrests Schwann cell differentiation, resulting in early postnatal lethality. Dicer−/− Schwann cells had lost their ability to myelinate, yet were still capable of sorting axons. Both cell death and, paradoxically, proliferation of immature Schwann cells was markedly enhanced, suggesting that their terminal differentiation is triggered by growth-arresting regulatory microRNAs. Using microRNA microarrays, we identified 16 microRNAs that are upregulated upon myelination and whose expression is controlled by Dicer in Schwann cells. This set of microRNAs appears to drive Schwann cell differentiation and myelination of peripheral nerves, thereby fulfilling a crucial function for survival of the organism."
https://openalex.org/W2077908559,"The South American phorusrhacid bird radiation comprised at least 18 species of small to gigantic terrestrial predators for which there are no close modern analogs. Here we perform functional analyses of the skull of the medium-sized (approximately 40 kg) patagornithine phorusrhacid Andalgalornis steulleti (upper Miocene-lower Pliocene, Andalgalá Formation, Catamarca, Argentina) to assess its mechanical performance in a comparative context. Based on computed tomographic (CT) scanning and morphological analysis, the skull of Andalgalornis steulleti is interpreted as showing features reflecting loss of intracranial immobility. Discrete anatomical attributes permitting such cranial kinesis are widespread phorusrhacids outgroups, but this is the first clear evidence of loss of cranial kinesis in a gruiform bird and may be among the best documented cases among all birds. This apomorphic loss is interpreted as an adaptation for enhanced craniofacial rigidity, particularly with regard to sagittal loading. We apply a Finite Element approach to a three-dimensional (3D) model of the skull. Based on regression analysis we estimate the bite force of Andalgalornis at the bill tip to be 133 N. Relative to results obtained from Finite Element Analysis of one of its closest living relatives (seriema) and a large predatory bird (eagle), the phorusrhacid's skull shows relatively high stress under lateral loadings, but low stress where force is applied dorsoventrally (sagittally) and in ""pullback"" simulations. Given the relative weakness of the skull mediolaterally, it seems unlikely that Andalgalornis engaged in potentially risky behaviors that involved subduing large, struggling prey with its beak. We suggest that it either consumed smaller prey that could be killed and consumed more safely (e.g., swallowed whole) or that it used multiple well-targeted sagittal strikes with the beak in a repetitive attack-and-retreat strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2094271757,"Inhaled β-agonists are effective airway smooth muscle (ASM)-relaxing agents that help reverse bronchoconstriction in asthma, but their ability to affect the aberrant ASM growth that also occurs with asthma is poorly understood. β-Agonists exhibit PKA-dependent antimitogenic effects in several cell types. However, recent studies suggest that Epac, and not PKA, mediates the antimitogenic effect of cAMP in both ASM and fibroblasts. This study aims to clarify the role of PKA in mediating the effect of G(s)-coupled receptors on human ASM growth. Pretreatment of ASM cultures with β-agonists albuterol, isoproterenol, or salmeterol (100 nM to 10 μM) caused a significant (∼ 25-30%) inhibition of EGF-stimulated ASM thymidine incorporation and cell proliferation, whereas a much greater inhibition was observed from pretreatment with PGE(2) (75-80%). However, all agents were ineffective in cells expressing GFP chimeras of either PKI (a PKA inhibitor) or a mutant PKA regulatory subunit relative to the control cells expressing GFP. The antimitogenic efficacy of PGE(2) in inhibiting control cultures was associated with greater ability to stimulate sustained PKA activation and greater inhibition of late-phase promitogenic p42/p44 and PI3K activities. These findings suggest that therapeutic approaches enabling superior PKA activation in ASM will be most efficacious in deterring ASM growth."
https://openalex.org/W2157386472,"Celiac Disease (CD) is both a frequent disease (1:100) and an interesting model of a disease induced by food. It consists in an immunogenic reaction to wheat gluten and glutenins that has been found to arise in a specific genetic background; however, this reaction is still only partially understood. Activation of innate immunity by gliadin peptides is an important component of the early events of the disease. In particular the so-called ""toxic"" A-gliadin peptide P31-43 induces several pleiotropic effects including Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-dependent actin remodelling and proliferation in cultured cell lines and in enterocytes from CD patients. These effects are mediated by delayed EGFR degradation and prolonged EGFR activation in endocytic vesicles. In the present study we investigated the effects of gliadin peptides on the trafficking and maturation of endocytic vesicles.Both P31-43 and the control P57-68 peptide labelled with fluorochromes were found to enter CaCo-2 cells and interact with the endocytic compartment in pulse and chase, time-lapse, experiments. P31-43 was localised to vesicles carrying early endocytic markers at time points when P57-68-carrying vesicles mature into late endosomes. In time-lapse experiments the trafficking of P31-43-labelled vesicles was delayed, regardless of the cargo they were carrying. Furthermore in celiac enterocytes, from cultured duodenal biopsies, P31-43 trafficking is delayed in early endocytic vesicles. A sequence similarity search revealed that P31-43 is strikingly similar to Hrs, a key molecule regulating endocytic maturation. A-gliadin peptide P31-43 interfered with Hrs correct localisation to early endosomes as revealed by western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy.P31-43 and P57-68 enter cells by endocytosis. Only P31-43 localises at the endocytic membranes and delays vesicle trafficking by interfering with Hrs-mediated maturation to late endosomes in cells and intestinal biopsies. Consequently, in P31-43-treated cells, Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) activation is extended. This finding may explain the role played by gliadin peptides in inducing proliferation and other effects in enterocytes from CD biopsies."
https://openalex.org/W1971310097,"Background Matricellular proteins, including periostin, modulate cell-matrix interactions and cell functions by acting outside of cells. Methods and Findings In this study, however, we reported that periostin physically associates with the Notch1 precursor at its EGF repeats in the inside of cells. Moreover, by using the periodontal ligament of molar from periostin-deficient adult mice (Pn−/− molar PDL), which is a constitutively mechanically stressed tissue, we found that periostin maintained the site-1 cleaved 120-kDa transmembrane domain of Notch1 (N1™) level without regulating Notch1 mRNA expression. N1™ maintenance in vitro was also observed under such a stress condition as heat and H2O2 treatment in periostin overexpressed cells. Furthermore, we found that the expression of a downstream effector of Notch signaling, Bcl-xL was decreased in the Pn−/− molar PDL, and in the molar movement, cell death was enhanced in the pressure side of Pn−/− molar PDL. Conclusion These results suggest the possibility that periostin inhibits cell death through up-regulation of Bcl-xL expression by maintaining the Notch1 protein level under the stress condition, which is caused by its physical association with the Notch1 precursor."
https://openalex.org/W2026685059,"Background Antisense oligonucleotide-induced exon skipping is a promising approach for treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). We have systemically administered an antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) targeting dystrophin exons 6 and 8 to a dog with canine X-linked muscular dystrophy in Japan (CXMDJ) lacking exon 7 and achieved recovery of dystrophin in skeletal muscle. To date, however, antisense chemical compounds used in DMD animal models have not been directly applied to a DMD patient having the same type of exon deletion. We recently identified a DMD patient with an exon 7 deletion and tried direct translation of the antisense PMO used in dog models to the DMD patient's cells. Methodology/Principal Findings We converted fibroblasts of CXMDJ and the DMD patient to myotubes by FACS-aided MyoD transduction. Antisense PMOs targeting identical regions of dog and human dystrophin exons 6 and 8 were designed. These antisense PMOs were mixed and administered as a cocktail to either dog or human cells in vitro. In the CXMDJ and human DMD cells, we observed a similar efficacy of skipping of exons 6 and 8 and a similar extent of dystrophin protein recovery. The accompanying skipping of exon 9, which did not alter the reading frame, was different between cells of these two species. Conclusion/Significance Antisense PMOs, the effectiveness of which has been demonstrated in a dog model, achieved multi-exon skipping of dystrophin gene on the FACS-aided MyoD-transduced fibroblasts from an exon 7-deleted DMD patient, suggesting the feasibility of systemic multi-exon skipping in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2123231604,"Leptospirosis is an important zoonosis with widespread human health implications. The non-availability of accurate identification methods for the individualization of different Leptospira for outbreak investigations poses bountiful problems in the disease control arena. We harnessed fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis (FAFLP) for Leptospira and investigated its utility in establishing genetic relationships among 271 isolates in the context of species level assignments of our global collection of isolates and strains obtained from a diverse array of hosts. In addition, this method was compared to an in-house multilocus sequence typing (MLST) method based on polymorphisms in three housekeeping genes, the rrs locus and two envelope proteins. Phylogenetic relationships were deduced based on bifurcating Neighbor-joining trees as well as median joining network analyses integrating both the FAFLP data and MLST based haplotypes. The phylogenetic relationships were also reproduced through Bayesian analysis of the multilocus sequence polymorphisms. We found FAFLP to be an important method for outbreak investigation and for clustering of isolates based on their geographical descent rather than by genome species types. The FAFLP method was, however, not able to convey much taxonomical utility sufficient to replace the highly tedious serotyping procedures in vogue. MLST, on the other hand, was found to be highly robust and efficient in identifying ancestral relationships and segregating the outbreak associated strains or otherwise according to their genome species status and, therefore, could unambiguously be applied for investigating phylogenetics of Leptospira in the context of taxonomy as well as gene flow. For instance, MLST was more efficient, as compared to FAFLP method, in clustering strains from the Andaman island of India, with their counterparts from mainland India and Sri Lanka, implying that such strains share genetic relationships and that leptospiral strains might be frequently circulating between the islands and the mainland."
https://openalex.org/W2008126077,"The loss of AP-2alpha and increased activity of cAMP-responsive element binding (CREB) protein are two hallmarks of malignant progression of cutaneous melanoma. However, the molecular mechanism responsible for the loss of AP-2alpha during melanoma progression remains unknown.Herein, we demonstrate that both inhibition of PKA-dependent CREB phosphorylation, as well as silencing of CREB expression by shRNA, restored AP-2alpha protein expression in two metastatic melanoma cell lines. Moreover, rescue of CREB expression in CREB-silenced cell lines downregulates expression of AP-2alpha. Loss of AP-2alpha expression in metastatic melanoma occurs via a dual mechanism involving binding of CREB to the AP-2alpha promoter and CREB-induced overexpression of another oncogenic transcription factor, E2F-1. Upregulation of AP-2alpha expression following CREB silencing increases endogenous p21(Waf1) and decreases MCAM/MUC18, both known to be downstream target genes of AP-2alpha involved in melanoma progression.Since AP-2alpha regulates several genes associated with the metastatic potential of melanoma including c-KIT, VEGF, PAR-1, MCAM/MUC18, and p21(Waf1), our data identified CREB as a major regulator of the malignant melanoma phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2169885772,"The biophysical mechanisms that give rise to direction selectivity in the retina remain uncertain. Current evidence suggests that the directional signal first arises within the dendrites of starburst amacrine cells (SBACs). Two models have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, one based on mutual inhibitory interactions between SBACs, and the other positing an intrinsic dendritic mechanism requiring a voltage-gradient depolarizing towards the dendritic tips. We tested these models by recording current and voltage responses to visual stimuli in SBACs. In agreement with previous work, we found that the excitatory currents in the SBACs were directional, and remained directional when GABA receptors were blocked. Contrary to the mutual-inhibitory model, stimuli that produce strong directional signals in ganglion cells failed to reveal a significant inhibitory input to SBACs. Suppression of the tonic excitatory conductance, proposed to generate the dendritic voltage-gradient required for the dendrite autonomous model, failed to eliminate the directional signal in SBACs. However, selective block of tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels did reduce the strength of the directional excitatory signal in the SBACs. These results indicate that current models of direction-selectivity in the SBACs are inadequate, and suggest that voltage-gated excitatory channels, specifically tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels, are important elements in directional signaling. This is the first physiological evidence that tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels play a role in retinal information processing."
https://openalex.org/W2108155376,"As the timing of spring productivity blooms in near-shore areas advances due to warming trends in global climate, the selection pressures on out-migrating salmon smolts are shifting. Species and stocks that leave natal streams earlier may be favoured over later-migrating fish. The low post-release survival of hatchery fish during recent years may be in part due to static release times that do not take the timing of plankton blooms into account. This study examined the effects of release time on the migratory behaviour and survival of wild and hatchery-reared coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) using acoustic and coded-wire telemetry. Plankton monitoring and near-shore seining were also conducted to determine which habitat and food sources were favoured. Acoustic tags (n = 140) and coded-wire tags (n = 266,692) were implanted into coho salmon smolts at the Seymour and Quinsam Rivers, in British Columbia, Canada. Differences between wild and hatchery fish, and early and late releases were examined during the entire lifecycle. Physiological sampling was also carried out on 30 fish from each release group. The smolt-to-adult survival of coho salmon released during periods of high marine productivity was 1.5- to 3-fold greater than those released both before and after, and the fish's degree of smoltification affected their downstream migration time and duration of stay in the estuary. Therefore, hatchery managers should consider having smolts fully developed and ready for release during the peak of the near-shore plankton blooms. Monitoring chlorophyll a levels and water temperature early in the spring could provide a forecast of the timing of these blooms, giving hatcheries time to adjust their release schedule."
https://openalex.org/W1991549110,"Background It is a commonly accepted belief that cancer cells modify their transcriptional state during the progression of the disease. We propose that the progression of cancer cells towards malignant phenotypes can be efficiently tracked using high-throughput technologies that follow the gradual changes observed in the gene expression profiles by employing Shannon's mathematical theory of communication. Methods based on Information Theory can then quantify the divergence of cancer cells' transcriptional profiles from those of normally appearing cells of the originating tissues. The relevance of the proposed methods can be evaluated using microarray datasets available in the public domain but the method is in principle applicable to other high-throughput methods. Methodology/Principal Findings Using melanoma and prostate cancer datasets we illustrate how it is possible to employ Shannon Entropy and the Jensen-Shannon divergence to trace the transcriptional changes progression of the disease. We establish how the variations of these two measures correlate with established biomarkers of cancer progression. The Information Theory measures allow us to identify novel biomarkers for both progressive and relatively more sudden transcriptional changes leading to malignant phenotypes. At the same time, the methodology was able to validate a large number of genes and processes that seem to be implicated in the progression of melanoma and prostate cancer. Conclusions/Significance We thus present a quantitative guiding rule, a new unifying hallmark of cancer: the cancer cell's transcriptome changes lead to measurable observed transitions of Normalized Shannon Entropy values (as measured by high-througput technologies). At the same time, tumor cells increment their divergence from the normal tissue profile increasing their disorder via creation of states that we might not directly measure. This unifying hallmark allows, via the the Jensen-Shannon divergence, to identify the arrow of time of the processes from the gene expression profiles, and helps to map the phenotypical and molecular hallmarks of specific cancer subtypes. The deep mathematical basis of the approach allows us to suggest that this principle is, hopefully, of general applicability for other diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2027773777,"Recent large-scale studies of European populations have demonstrated the existence of population genetic structure within Europe and the potential to accurately infer individual ancestry when information from hundreds of thousands of genetic markers is used. In fact, when genomewide genetic variation of European populations is projected down to a two-dimensional Principal Components Analysis plot, a surprising correlation with actual geographic coordinates of self-reported ancestry has been reported. This substructure can hamper the search of susceptibility genes for common complex disorders leading to spurious correlations. The identification of genetic markers that can correct for population stratification becomes therefore of paramount importance. Analyzing 1,200 individuals from 11 populations genotyped for more than 500,000 SNPs (Population Reference Sample), we present a systematic exploration of the extent to which geographic coordinates of origin within Europe can be predicted, with small panels of SNPs. Markers are selected to correlate with the top principal components of the dataset, as we have previously demonstrated. Performing thorough cross-validation experiments we show that it is indeed possible to predict individual ancestry within Europe down to a few hundred kilometers from actual individual origin, using information from carefully selected panels of 500 or 1,000 SNPs. Furthermore, we show that these panels can be used to correctly assign the HapMap Phase 3 European populations to their geographic origin. The SNPs that we propose can prove extremely useful in a variety of different settings, such as stratification correction or genetic ancestry testing, and the study of the history of European populations."
https://openalex.org/W2111137836,"Background Despite considerable effort, the genetic factors responsible for >90% of the antibody deficiency syndromes IgAD and CVID remain elusive. To produce a functionally diverse antibody repertoire B lymphocytes undergo class switch recombination. This process is initiated by AID-catalyzed deamination of cytidine to uridine in switch region DNA. Subsequently, these residues are recognized by the uracil excision enzyme UNG2 or the mismatch repair proteins MutSα (MSH2/MSH6) and MutLα (PMS2/MLH1). Further processing by ubiquitous DNA repair factors is thought to introduce DNA breaks, ultimately leading to class switch recombination and expression of a different antibody isotype. Methodology/Principal Findings Defects in AID and UNG2 have been shown to result in the primary immunodeficiency hyper-IgM syndrome, leading us to hypothesize that additional, potentially more subtle, DNA repair gene variations may underlie the clinically related antibody deficiencies syndromes IgAD and CVID. In a survey of twenty-seven candidate DNA metabolism genes, markers in MSH2, RAD50, and RAD52 were associated with IgAD/CVID, prompting further investigation into these pathways. Resequencing identified four rare, non-synonymous alleles associated with IgAD/CVID, two in MLH1, one in RAD50, and one in NBS1. One IgAD patient carried heterozygous non-synonymous mutations in MLH1, MSH2, and NBS1. Functional studies revealed that one of the identified mutations, a premature RAD50 stop codon (Q372X), confers increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Conclusions Our results are consistent with a class switch recombination model in which AID-catalyzed uridines are processed by multiple DNA repair pathways. Genetic defects in these DNA repair pathways may contribute to IgAD and CVID."
https://openalex.org/W2008343573,"Nitrate and nitrite (jointly referred to herein as NO(x)) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants to which aquatic organisms are at particularly high risk of exposure. We tested the hypothesis that NO(x) undergo intracellular conversion to the potent signaling molecule nitric oxide resulting in the disruption of endocrine-regulated processes.These experiments were performed with insect cells (Drosophila S2) and whole organisms Daphnia magna. We first evaluated the ability of cells to convert nitrate (NO(3)(-)) and nitrite (NO(2)(-)) to nitric oxide using amperometric real-time nitric oxide detection. Both NO(3)(-) and NO(2)(-) were converted to nitric oxide in a substrate concentration-dependent manner. Further, nitric oxide trapping and fluorescent visualization studies revealed that perinatal daphnids readily convert NO(2)(-) to nitric oxide. Next, daphnids were continuously exposed to concentrations of the nitric oxide-donor sodium nitroprusside (positive control) and to concentrations of NO(3)(-) and NO(2)(-). All three compounds interfered with normal embryo development and reduced daphnid fecundity. Developmental abnormalities were characteristic of those elicited by compounds that interfere with ecdysteroid signaling. However, no compelling evidence was generated to indicate that nitric oxide reduced ecdysteroid titers.Results demonstrate that nitrite elicits developmental and reproductive toxicity at environmentally relevant concentrations due likely to its intracellular conversion to nitric oxide."
https://openalex.org/W2010576677,"In our earlier reports, we showed that downregulation of uPA and uPAR inhibited glioma tumor angiogenesis in SNB19 cells, and intraperitoneal injection of a hairpin shRNA expressing plasmid targeting uPA and uPAR inhibited angiogenesis in nude mice. The exact mechanism by which inhibition of angiogenesis takes place is not clearly understood.In the present study, we have attempted to investigate the mechanism by which uPA/uPAR downregulation by shRNA inhibits angiogenesis in endothelial and glioblastoma cell lines. uPA/uPAR downregulation by shRNA in U87 MG and U87 SPARC co-cultures with endothelial cells inhibited angiogenesis as assessed by in vitro angiogenesis assay and in vivo dorsal skin-fold chamber model in nude mice. Protein antibody array analysis of co-cultures of U87 and U87 SPARC cells with endothelial cells treated with pU2 (shRNA against uPA and uPAR) showed decreased angiogenin secretion and angiopoietin-1 as well as several other pro-angiogenic molecules. Therefore, we investigated the role of angiogenin and found that nuclear translocation, ribonucleolytic and 45S rRNA synthesis, which are all critical for angiogenic function of angiogenin, were significantly inhibited in endothelial cells transfected with uPA, uPAR and uPA/uPAR when compared with controls. Moreover, uPA and uPAR downregulation significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of Tie-2 receptor and also down regulated FKHR activation in the nucleus of endothelial cells via the GRB2/AKT/BAD pathway. Treatment of endothelial cells with ruPA increased angiogenin secretion and angiogenin expression as determined by ELISA and western blotting in a dose-dependent manner. The amino terminal fragment of uPA down regulated ruPA-induced angiogenin in endothelial cells, thereby suggesting that uPA plays a critical role in positively regulating angiogenin in glioblastoma cells.Taken together, our results suggest that uPA/uPAR downregulation suppresses angiogenesis in endothelial cells induced by glioblastoma cell lines partially by downregulation of angiogenin and by inhibition of the angiopoietin-1/AKT/FKHR pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1963533660,"Background Gene order in eukaryotic genomes is not random. Genes showing similar expression (coexpression) patterns are often clustered along the genome. The goal of this study is to characterize coexpression clustering in mammalian genomes and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Methodology/Principal Findings We detect clustering of coexpressed genes across multiple scales, from neighboring genes to chromosomal domains that span tens of megabases and, in some cases, entire chromosomes. Coexpression domains may be positively or negatively correlated with other domains, within and between chromosomes. We find that long-range expression domains are associated with gene density, which in turn is related to physical organization of the chromosomes within the nucleus. We show that gene expression changes between healthy and diseased tissue samples occur in a gene density-dependent manner. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrate that coexpression domains exist across multiple scales. We identify potential mechanisms for short-range as well as long-range coexpression domains. We provide evidence that the three-dimensional architecture of the chromosomes may underlie long-range coexpression domains. Chromosome territory reorganization may play a role in common human diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and psoriasis."
https://openalex.org/W1966454291,"Ingestion of glucosinolates has previously been reported to improve endothelial function in spontaneously hypertensive rats, possibly because of an increase in NO availability in the endothelium due to an attenuation of oxidative stress; in our study we tried to see if this also would be the case in humans suffering from essential hypertension.40 hypertensive individuals without diabetes and with normal levels of cholesterol were examined. The participants were randomized either to ingest 10 g dried broccoli sprouts, a natural donor of glucosinolates with high in vitro antioxidative potential, for a 4 week period or to continue their ordinary diet and act as controls. Blood pressure, endothelial function measured by flow mediated dilation (FMD) and blood samples were obtained from the participants every other week and the content of glucosinolates was measured before and after the study. Measurements were blinded to treatment allocation.In the interventional group overall FMD increased from 4% to 5.8% in the interventional group whereas in the control group FMD was stable (4% at baseline and 3.9% at the end of the study). The change in FMD in the interventional group was mainly due to a marked change in FMD in two participants while the other participants did not have marked changes in FMD. The observed differences were not statistically significant. Likewise significant changes in blood pressure or blood samples were not detected between or within groups. Diastolic blood pressure stayed essentially unchanged in both groups, while the systolic blood pressure showed a small non significant decrease (9 mm Hg) in the interventional group from a value of 153 mm Hg at start.Daily ingestion of 10 g dried broccoli sprouts does not improve endothelial function in the presence of hypertension in humans.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00252018."
https://openalex.org/W2044774134,"Background Pathogen-specific metabolic pathways may be detected by breath tests based on introduction of stable isotopically-labeled substrates and detection of labeled products in exhaled breath using portable infrared spectrometers. Methodology/Principal Findings We tested whether mycobacterial urease activity could be utilized in such a breath test format as the basis of a novel biomarker and diagnostic for pulmonary TB. Sensitized New-Zealand White Rabbits underwent bronchoscopic infection with either Mycobacterium bovis or Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Rabbits were treated with 25 mg/kg of isoniazid (INH) approximately 2 months after infection when significant cavitary lung pathology was present. [13C] urea was instilled directly into the lungs of intubated rabbits at selected time points, exhaled air samples analyzed, and the kinetics of δ13CO2 formation were determined. Samples obtained prior to inoculation served as control samples for background 13CO2 conversion in the rabbit model. 13CO2, from metabolic conversion of [13C]-urea by mycobacterial urease activity, was readily detectable in the exhaled breath of infected rabbits within 15 minutes of administration. Analyses showed a rapid increase in the rate of 13CO2 formation both early in disease and prior to treatment with INH. Following INH treatment, all evaluable rabbits showed a decrease in the rate of 13CO2 formation. Conclusions/Significance Urea breath testing may provide a useful diagnostic and biomarker assay for tuberculosis and for treatment response. Future work will test specificity for M. tuberculosis using lung-targeted dry powder inhalation formulations, combined with co-administering oral urease inhibitors together with a saturating oral dose of unlabeled urea, which would prevent the δ13CO2 signal from urease-positive gastrointestinal organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2039343405,"Different fusion oncogenes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have distinct clinical and laboratory features suggesting different modes of malignant transformation. Here we compare the in vitro effects of representatives of 4 major groups of AML fusion oncogenes on primary human CD34+ cells. As expected from their clinical similarities, MLL-AF9 and NUP98-HOXA9 had very similar effects in vitro. They both caused erythroid hyperplasia and a clear block in erythroid and myeloid maturation. On the other hand, AML1-ETO and PML-RARA had only modest effects on myeloid and erythroid differentiation. All oncogenes except PML-RARA caused a dramatic increase in long-term proliferation and self-renewal. Gene expression profiling revealed two distinct temporal patterns of gene deregulation. Gene deregulation by MLL-AF9 and NUP98-HOXA9 peaked 3 days after transduction. In contrast, the vast majority of gene deregulation by AML1-ETO and PML-RARA occurred within 6 hours, followed by a dramatic drop in the numbers of deregulated genes. Interestingly, the p53 inhibitor MDM2 was upregulated by AML1-ETO at 6 hours. Nutlin-3, an inhibitor of the interaction between MDM2 and p53, specifically inhibited the proliferation and self-renewal of primary human CD34+ cells transduced with AML1-ETO, suggesting that MDM2 upregulation plays a role in cell transformation by AML1-ETO. These data show that differences among AML fusion oncogenes can be recapitulated in vitro using primary human CD34+ cells and that early gene expression profiling in these cells can reveal potential drug targets in AML."
https://openalex.org/W2061455147,"Background We consider a focal adhesion to be made up of molecular complexes, each consisting of a ligand, an integrin molecule, and associated plaque proteins. Free energy changes drive the binding and unbinding of these complexes and thereby controls the focal adhesion's dynamic modes of growth, treadmilling and resorption. Principal Findings We have identified a competition among four thermodynamic driving forces for focal adhesion dynamics: (i) the work done during the addition of a single molecular complex of a certain size, (ii) the chemical free energy change associated with the addition of a molecular complex, (iii) the elastic free energy change associated with deformation of focal adhesions and the cell membrane, and (iv) the work done on a molecular conformational change. We have developed a theoretical treatment of focal adhesion dynamics as a nonlinear rate process governed by a classical kinetic model. We also express the rates as being driven by out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic driving forces, and modulated by kinetics. The mechanisms governed by the above four effects allow focal adhesions to exhibit a rich variety of behavior without the need to introduce special constitutive assumptions for their response. For the reaction-limited case growth, treadmilling and resorption are all predicted by a very simple chemo-mechanical model. Treadmilling requires symmetry breaking between the ends of the focal adhesion, and is achieved by driving force (i) above. In contrast, depending on its numerical value (ii) causes symmetric growth, resorption or is neutral, (iii) causes symmetric resorption, and (iv) causes symmetric growth. These findings hold for a range of conditions: temporally-constant force or stress, and for spatially-uniform and non-uniform stress distribution over the FA. The symmetric growth mode dominates for temporally-constant stress, with a reduced treadmilling regime. Significance In addition to explaining focal adhesion dynamics, this treatment can be coupled with models of cytoskeleton dynamics and contribute to the understanding of cell motility."
https://openalex.org/W2084685373,"We apply our recently developed information-theoretic measures for the characterisation and comparison of protein-protein interaction networks. These measures are used to quantify topological network features via macroscopic statistical properties. Network differences are assessed based on these macroscopic properties as opposed to microscopic overlap, homology information or motif occurrences. We present the results of a large-scale analysis of protein-protein interaction networks. Precise null models are used in our analyses, allowing for reliable interpretation of the results. By quantifying the methodological biases of the experimental data, we can define an information threshold above which networks may be deemed to comprise consistent macroscopic topological properties, despite their small microscopic overlaps. Based on this rationale, data from yeast-two-hybrid methods are sufficiently consistent to allow for intra-species comparisons (between different experiments) and inter-species comparisons, while data from affinity-purification mass-spectrometry methods show large differences even within intra-species comparisons."
https://openalex.org/W1995472515,"The Arf tumor suppressor acts as a sensor of oncogenic signals, countering aberrant proliferation in large part via activation of the p53 transcriptional program, though a number of p53-independent functions have been described. Mounting evidence suggests that, in addition to promoting tumorigenesis via disruptions in the homeostatic balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis of overt cancer cells, genetic alterations leading to tumor suppressor loss of function or oncogene gain of function can also incite tumor development via effects on the tumor microenvironment. In a transgenic mouse model of multi-stage pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinogenesis (PNET) driven by inhibition of the canonical p53 and Rb tumor suppressors with SV40 large T-antigen (Tag), stochastic progression to tumors is limited in part by a requirement for initiation of an angiogenic switch. Despite inhibition of p53 by Tag in this mouse PNET model, concomitant disruption of Arf via genetic knockout resulted in a significantly accelerated pathway to tumor formation that was surprisingly not driven by alterations in tumor cell proliferation or apoptosis, but rather via earlier activation of the angiogenic switch. In the setting of a constitutional p53 gene knockout, loss of Arf also accelerated tumor development, albeit to a lesser degree. These findings demonstrate that Arf loss of function can promote tumorigenesis via facilitating angiogenesis, at least in part, through p53-independent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1967596017,"Background Comparative genomics has revealed an unexpected level of conservation for gene products across the evolution of animal species. However, the molecular function of only a few proteins has been investigated experimentally, and the role of many animal proteins still remains unknown. Here we report the characterization of a novel family of evolutionary conserved proteins, which display specific features of cytoskeletal scaffolding proteins, referred to as LRCHs. Principal Findings Taking advantage of the existence of a single LRCH gene in flies, dLRCH, we explored its function in cultured cells, and show that dLRCH act to stabilize the cell cortex during cell division. dLRCH depletion leads to ectopic cortical blebs and alters positioning of the mitotic spindle. We further examined the consequences of dLRCH deletion throughout development and adult life. Although dLRCH is not essential for cell division in vivo, flies lacking dLRCH display a reduced fertility and fitness, particularly when raised at extreme temperatures. Conclusion/Significance These results support the idea that some cytoskeletal regulators are important to buffer environmental variations and ensure the proper execution of basic cellular processes, such as the control of cell shape, under environmental variations."
https://openalex.org/W1984372709,"Background The Abelson helper integration-1 (AHI1) gene is required for both cerebellar and cortical development in humans. While the accelerated evolution of AHI1 in the human lineage indicates a role in cognitive (dys)function, a linkage scan in large pedigrees identified AHI1 as a positional candidate for schizophrenia. To further investigate the contribution of AHI1 to the susceptibility of schizophrenia, we evaluated the effect of AHI1 variation on the vulnerability to psychosis in two samples from Spain and Germany. Methodology/Principal Findings 29 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in a genomic region including the AHI1 gene were genotyped in two samples from Spain (280 patients with psychotic disorders; 348 controls) and Germany (247 patients with schizophrenic disorders; 360 controls). Allelic, genotypic and haplotype frequencies were compared between cases and controls in both samples separately, as well as in the combined sample. The effect of genotype on several psychopathological measures (BPRS, KGV, PANSS) assessed in a Spanish subsample was also evaluated. We found several significant associations in the Spanish sample. Particularly, rs7750586 and rs911507, both located upstream of the AHI1 coding region, were found to be associated with schizophrenia in the analysis of genotypic (p = 0.0033, and 0.031, respectively) and allelic frequencies (p = 0.001 in both cases). Moreover, several other risk and protective haplotypes were detected (0.006<p<0.036). Joint analysis also supported the association of rs7750586 and rs911507 with the risk for schizophrenia. The analysis of clinical measures also revealed an effect on symptom severity (minimum P value = 0.0037). Conclusions/Significance Our data support, in agreement with previous reports, an effect of AHI1 variation on the susceptibility to schizophrenia in central and southern European populations."
https://openalex.org/W2022391531,"Background Significance Communication signals that function to bring together the sexes are important for maintaining reproductive isolation in many taxa. Changes in male calls are often attributed to sexual selection, in which female preferences initiate signal divergence. Natural selection can also influence signal traits if calls attract predators or parasitoids, or if calling is energetically costly. Neutral evolution is often neglected in the context of acoustic communication. Methodology/Principal Findings We describe a signal trait that appears to have evolved in the absence of either sexual or natural selection. In the katydid genus Neoconocephalus, calls with a derived pattern in which pulses are grouped into pairs have evolved five times independently. We have previously shown that in three of these species, females require the double pulse pattern for call recognition, and hence the recognition system of the females is also in a derived state. Here we describe the remaining two species and find that although males produce the derived call pattern, females use the ancestral recognition mechanism in which no pulse pattern is required. Females respond equally well to the single and double pulse calls, indicating that the derived trait is selectively neutral in the context of mate recognition. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that 1) neutral changes in signal traits could be important in the diversification of communication systems, and 2) males rather than females may be responsible for initiating signal divergence."
https://openalex.org/W2114869964,"Background Home management of malaria (HMM), promoting presumptive treatment of febrile children in the community, is advocated to improve prompt appropriate treatment of malaria in Africa. The cost-effectiveness of HMM is likely to vary widely in different settings and with the antimalarial drugs used. However, no data on the cost-effectiveness of HMM programmes are available. Methods/Principal Findings A Markov model was constructed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of HMM as compared to conventional care for febrile illnesses in children without HMM. The model was populated with data from Uganda, but is designed to be interactive, allowing the user to adjust certain parameters, including the antimalarials distributed. The model calculates the cost per disability adjusted life year averted and presents the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio compared to a threshold value. Model output is stratified by level of malaria transmission and the probability that a child would receive appropriate care from a health facility, to indicate the circumstances in which HMM is likely to be cost-effective. The model output suggests that the cost-effectiveness of HMM varies with malaria transmission, the probability of appropriate care, and the drug distributed. Where transmission is high and the probability of appropriate care is limited, HMM is likely to be cost-effective from a provider perspective. Even with the most effective antimalarials, HMM remains an attractive intervention only in areas of high malaria transmission and in medium transmission areas with a lower probability of appropriate care. HMM is generally not cost-effective in low transmission areas, regardless of which antimalarial is distributed. Considering the analysis from the societal perspective decreases the attractiveness of HMM. Conclusion Syndromic HMM for children with fever may be a useful strategy for higher transmission settings with limited health care and diagnosis, but is not appropriate for all settings. HMM may need to be tailored to specific settings, accounting for local malaria transmission intensity and availability of health services."
https://openalex.org/W2077103399,"The basement membrane (BM) proteins laminins, which consist of α, β, and γ chains, support tissue structures and cellular functions. To date only α4 and α5 types of laminins have been identified in the BMs of blood vessels. Our recent study suggested the presence of novel α3B-containing laminins in vascular BMs. Here we identified and characterized the third member of vascular laminins, laminin-3B11 (Lm3B11). RT-PCR analysis showed that microvascular endothelial (MVE) cells and umbilical vein endothelial cells expressed the messages for the α3B, β1, β2, and γ1 chains. In the culture of MVE cells, α3B was associated with β1 and γ1, producing Lm3B11. Recombinant Lm3B11 was overexpressed by introducing the cDNAs of the three chains into HEK-293 cells and purified to homogeneity. Purified Lm3B11 exhibited relatively weak cell adhesion activity through both α3β1 and α6β1 integrins. Most characteristically, Lm3B11 strongly stimulated MVE cells to extend many lamellipodial protrusions. This pseudopodial branching was blocked by an inhibitor for Src or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Consistently, Lm3B11 stimulated the phosphorylation of Src and Akt more strongly than other laminins, suggesting that the integrin-derived signaling is mediated by these factors. The unique activity of Lm3B11 appears to be favorable to the branching of capillaries and venules."
https://openalex.org/W1997423978,"Class V myosin (myosin-V) is a cargo transporter that moves along an actin filament with large (approximately 36-nm) successive steps. It consists of two heads that each includes a motor domain and a long (23 nm) neck domain. One of the more popular models describing these steps, the hand-over-hand model, assumes the two-headed structure is imperative. However, we previously succeeded in observing successive large steps by one-headed myosin-V upon optimizing the angle of the acto-myosin interaction. In addition, it was reported that wild type myosin-VI and myosin-IX, both one-headed myosins, can also generate successive large steps. Here, we describe the mechanical properties (stepsize and stepping kinetics) of successive large steps by one-headed and two-headed myosin-Vs. This study shows that the stepsize and stepping kinetics of one-headed myosin-V are very similar to those of the two-headed one. However, there was a difference with regards to stability against load and the number of multisteps. One-headed myosin-V also showed unidirectional movement that like two-headed myosin-V required 3.5 k(B)T from ATP hydrolysis. This value is also similar to that of smooth muscle myosin-II, a non-processive motor, suggesting the myosin family uses a common mechanism for stepping regardless of the steps being processive or non-processive. In this present paper, we conclude that one-headed myosin-V can produce successive large steps without following the hand-over-hand mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2049835322,"Background The recently described Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein (DARPin) technology can produce highly selective ligands to a variety of biological targets at a low production cost. Methodology/Principal Findings To investigate the in vivo use of DARPins for future application to novel anti-HIV strategies, we identified potent CD4-specific DARPins that recognize rhesus CD4 and followed the fate of intravenously injected CD4-specific DARPin 57.2 in rhesus macaques. The human CD4-specific DARPin 57.2 bound macaque CD4+ cells and exhibited potent inhibitory activity against SIV infection in vitro. DARPin 57.2 or the control E3_5 DARPin was injected into rhesus macaques and the fate of cell-free and cell-bound CD4-specific DARPin was evaluated. DARPin-bound CD4+ cells were detected in the peripheral blood as early as 30 minutes after the injection, decreasing within 6 hours and being almost undetectable within 24 hours. The amount of DARPin bound was dependent on the amount of DARPin injected. CD4-specific DARPin was also detected on CD4+ cells in the lymph nodes within 30 minutes, which persisted with similar kinetics to blood. More extensive analysis using blood revealed that DARPin 57.2 bound to all CD4+ cell types (T cells, monocytes, dendritic cells) in vivo and in vitro with the amount of binding directly proportional to the amount of CD4 on the cell surface. Cell-free DARPins were also detected in the plasma, but were rapidly cleared from circulation. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrated that the CD4-specific DARPin can rapidly and selectively bind its target cells in vivo, warranting further studies on possible clinical use of the DARPin technology."
https://openalex.org/W2073350413,"RNA splicing generates multiple transcript isoforms from a single gene and enhances the complexity of eukaryotic gene expression. In some eukaryotes, operon exists as an ancient regulatory mechanism of gene expression that requires strict positional and regulatory relationships among its genes. It remains unknown whether operonic genes generate transcript isoforms in a similar manner as non-operonic genes do, the expression of which is less likely limited by their positions and relationships with surrounding genes. We analyzed the number of transcript isoforms of Caenorhabditis elegans operonic genes and found that C. elegans operons contain a much higher proportion of genes with multiple transcript isoforms than non-operonic genes do. For genes that express multiple transcript isoforms, there is no apparent difference between the number of isoforms in operonic and non-operonic genes. C. elegans operonic genes also have a different preference of the 20 most common 3' splice sites compared to non-operonic genes. Our analyses suggest that C. elegans operons enhance expression complexity by increasing the proportion of genes that express multiple transcript isoforms and maintain splicing efficiency by differential use of common 3' splice sites."
https://openalex.org/W2026861727,"Parasite virulence evolution is shaped by both within-host and population-level processes yet the link between these differing scales of infection is often neglected. Population structure and heterogeneity in both parasites and hosts will affect how hosts are exploited by pathogens and the intensity of infection. Here, it is shown how the degree of relatedness among parasites together with epidemiological parameters such as pathogen yield and longevity influence the evolution of virulence. Furthermore, the role of kin competition and the degree of cheating within highly structured parasite populations also influences parasite fitness and infectivity patterns. Understanding how the effects of within-host processes scale up to affect the epidemiology has importance for understanding host-pathogen interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2079057862,"Gene silencing by transient or stable RNA-interference (RNAi) is used for the study of apoptosis with an assumption that apoptotic events will not influence RNAi. However, we recently reported that stable RNAi, i.e., a permanent gene-knockdown mediated by shRNA-generating DNA vectors that are integrated in the genome, fails rapidly after induction of apoptosis due to caspase-3-mediated cleavage and inactivation of the endoribonuclease Dicer-1 that is required for conversion of shRNA to siRNA. Since apoptosis studies also increasingly employ transient RNAi models in which apoptosis is induced immediately after a gene is temporarily knocked down within a few days of transfection with RNAi-inducing agents, we examined the impact of apoptosis on various models of transient RNAi. We report here that unlike the stable RNAi, all forms of transient RNAi, whether Dicer-1-independent (by 21mer dsRNA) or Dicer-1-dependent (by 27mer dsRNA or shRNA-generating DNA vector), whether for an exogenous gene GFP or an endogenous gene poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, do not fail for 2–3 days after onset of apoptosis. Our results reflect the differences in dynamics of achieving and maintaining RNAi during the early phase after transfection in the transient RNAi model and the late steady-state phase of gene-knockdown in stable RNAi model. Our results also sound a cautionary note that RNAi status should be frequently validated in the studies involving apoptosis and that while stable RNAi can be safely used for the study of early apoptotic events, transient RNAi is more suitable for the study of both early and late apoptotic events."
