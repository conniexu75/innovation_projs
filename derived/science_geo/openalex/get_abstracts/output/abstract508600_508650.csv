https://openalex.org/W2029649819,"The incidences of chronic inflammatory disorders have increased considerably over the past three decades. Recent shifts in dietary consumption may have contributed importantly to this surge, but how dietary consumption modulates inflammatory disease is poorly defined. Pstpip2(cmo) mice, which express a homozygous Leu98Pro missense mutation in the Pombe Cdc15 homology family protein PSTPIP2 (proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein 2), spontaneously develop osteomyelitis that resembles chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis in humans. Recent reports demonstrated a crucial role for interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in osteomyelitis, but deletion of the inflammasome components caspase-1 and NLRP3 failed to rescue Pstpip2(cmo) mice from inflammatory bone disease. Thus, the upstream mechanisms controlling IL-1β production in Pstpip2(cmo) mice remain to be identified. In addition, the environmental factors driving IL-1β-dependent inflammatory bone erosion are unknown. Here we show that the intestinal microbiota of diseased Pstpip2(cmo) mice was characterized by an outgrowth of Prevotella. Notably, Pstpip2(cmo) mice that were fed a diet rich in fat and cholesterol maintained a normal body weight, but were markedly protected against inflammatory bone disease and bone erosion. Diet-induced protection against osteomyelitis was accompanied by marked reductions in intestinal Prevotella levels and significantly reduced pro-IL-1β expression in distant neutrophils. Furthermore, pro-IL-1β expression was also decreased in Pstpip2(cmo) mice treated with antibiotics, and in wild-type mice that were kept under germ-free conditions. We further demonstrate that combined deletion of caspases 1 and 8 was required for protection against IL-1β-dependent inflammatory bone disease, whereas the deletion of either caspase alone or of elastase or neutrophil proteinase 3 failed to prevent inflammatory disease. Collectively, this work reveals diet-associated changes in the intestinal microbiome as a crucial factor regulating inflammasome- and caspase-8-mediated maturation of IL-1β and osteomyelitis in Pstpip2(cmo) mice."

https://openalex.org/W2080990615,"Insects and their six-legged relatives (Hexapoda) comprise more than half of all described species and dominate terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Understanding the macroevolutionary processes generating this richness requires a historical perspective, but the fossil record of hexapods is patchy and incomplete. Dated molecular phylogenies provide an alternative perspective on divergence times and have been combined with birth-death models to infer patterns of diversification across a range of taxonomic groups. Here we generate a dated phylogeny of hexapod families, based on previously published sequence data and literature derived constraints, in order to identify the broad pattern of macroevolutionary changes responsible for the composition of the extant hexapod fauna. The most prominent increase in diversification identified is associated with the origin of complete metamorphosis, confirming this as a key innovation in promoting insect diversity. Subsequent reductions are recovered for several groups previously identified as having a higher fossil diversity during the Mesozoic. In addition, a number of recently derived taxa are found to have radiated following the development of flowering plant (angiosperm) floras during the mid-Cretaceous. These results reveal that the composition of the modern hexapod fauna is a product of a key developmental innovation, combined with multiple and varied evolutionary responses to environmental changes from the mid Cretaceous floral transition onward."
https://openalex.org/W1969215521,"Global production of rice (Oryza sativa) grain is limited by water availability and the low ‘leaf-level’ photosynthetic capacity of many cultivars. Oryza sativa is extremely susceptible to water-deficits; therefore, predicted increases in the frequency and duration of drought events, combined with future rises in global temperatures and food demand, necessitate the development of more productive and drought tolerant cultivars. We investigated the underlying physiological, isotopic and morphological responses to water-deficit in seven common varieties of O. sativa, subjected to prolonged drought of varying intensities, for phenotyping purposes in open field conditions. Significant variation was observed in leaf-level photosynthesis rates (A) under both water treatments. Yield and A were influenced by the conductance of the mesophyll layer to CO2 (gm) and not by stomatal conductance (gs). Mesophyll conductance declined during drought to differing extents among the cultivars; those varieties that maintained gm during water-deficit sustained A and yield to a greater extent. However, the variety with the highest gm and yield under well-watered conditions (IR55419-04) was distinct from the most effective cultivar under drought (Vandana). Mesophyll conductance most effectively characterises the photosynthetic capacity and yield of O. sativa cultivars under both well-watered and water-deficit conditions; however, the desired attributes of high gm during optimal growth conditions and the capacity for gm to remain constant during water-deficit may be mutually exclusive. Nonetheless, future genetic and physiological studies aimed at enhancing O. sativa yield and drought stress tolerance should investigate the biochemistry and morphology of the interface between the sub-stomatal pore and mesophyll layer."
https://openalex.org/W2014944948,"Until now, physiological mechanisms and downstream targets responsible for the cadmium (Cd) tolerance mediated by endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) have been elusive. To address this gap, a combination of pharmacological, histochemical, biochemical and molecular approaches was applied. The perturbation of reduced (homo)glutathione homeostasis and increased H2S production as well as the activation of two H2S-synthetic enzymes activities, including L-cysteine desulfhydrase (LCD) and D-cysteine desulfhydrase (DCD), in alfalfa seedling roots were early responses to the exposure of Cd. The application of H2S donor sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), not only mimicked intracellular H2S production triggered by Cd, but also alleviated Cd toxicity in a H2S-dependent fashion. By contrast, the inhibition of H2S production caused by the application of its synthetic inhibitor blocked NaHS-induced Cd tolerance, and destroyed reduced (homo)glutathione and reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostases. Above mentioned inhibitory responses were further rescued by exogenously applied glutathione (GSH). Meanwhile, NaHS responses were sensitive to a (homo)glutathione synthetic inhibitor, but reversed by the cotreatment with GSH. The possible involvement of cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling in NaHS responses was also suggested. In summary, LCD/DCD-mediated H2S might be an important signaling molecule in the enhancement of Cd toxicity in alfalfa seedlings mainly by governing reduced (homo)glutathione and ROS homeostases."
https://openalex.org/W2011333269,"Transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes is increasingly well-understood on a global scale, yet no comparable information exists for long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes, which were recently recognized to be as numerous as protein-coding genes in mammalian genomes. We performed a genome-wide comparative analysis of the promoters of human lncRNA and protein-coding genes, finding global differences in specific genetic and epigenetic features relevant to transcriptional regulation. These two groups of genes are hence subject to separate transcriptional regulatory programs, including distinct transcription factor (TF) proteins that significantly favor lncRNA, rather than coding-gene, promoters. We report a specific signature of promoter-proximal transcriptional regulation of lncRNA genes, including several distinct transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Experimental DNase I hypersensitive site profiles are consistent with active configurations of these lncRNA TFBS sets in diverse human cell types. TFBS ChIP-seq datasets confirm the binding events that we predicted using computational approaches for a subset of factors. For several TFs known to be directly regulated by lncRNAs, we find that their putative TFBSs are enriched at lncRNA promoters, suggesting that the TFs and the lncRNAs may participate in a bidirectional feedback loop regulatory network. Accordingly, cells may be able to modulate lncRNA expression levels independently of mRNA levels via distinct regulatory pathways. Our results also raise the possibility that, given the historical reliance on protein-coding gene catalogs to define the chromatin states of active promoters, a revision of these chromatin signature profiles to incorporate expressed lncRNA genes is warranted in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2119582125,"Background and Aim Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most deadly tumors. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is effective for unresectable HCC. In recent years, miRNAs have been proposed as novel diagnostic and prognostic tools for HCC. This study aimed to identify whether microRNAs (miRNAs) can serve as biomarkers to reliably predict outcome before HCC patients are treated with TACE. Methods Eleven miRNAs (miR-, miR-19a, miR-101-3p, miR-199a-5p, miR-200a, miR-21, miR-214, miR-221, miR-222, miR-223 and miR-, -5p) were quantified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in 136 HCC patients’ serum before they received TACE therapy. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to identify the prognostic value of clinical parameters and miRNAs. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the prediction potency. Results The levels of some miRNAs were dramatically associated with clinicopathologic features regarding Child-Puge class, AFP, tumor size and satellite nodules. Univariate analysis revealed that miR-200a, miR-21, miR-122 and miR-224-5p were significantly associated with patients’ survival. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that AFP, satellite nodules and miR-200a were the independent prognostic factors associated with survival in this cohort (p = 0.000, 0.001, 0.000, respectively). The probability of the prognostic accuracy of miR-200a was 81.64% (74.47% specificity and 88.76% sensitivity), which was higher than the classifier established by combination of AFP and satellite nodules (76.87% probability, 70.21% specificity and 69.66% sensitivity). Furthermore, the combination of AFP, satellite nodules and miR-200a demonstrated as a classifier for HCC prognosis, yielding a ROC curve area of 88.19% (93.62% specificity and 68.54% sensitivity). Conclusions Our study indicated that serum miR-200a may prognosticate disease outcome in HCC patients with TACE therapy. Therefore, miR-200a can potentially guide individualized treatment for HCC patients with a high risk of TACE treatment failures."
https://openalex.org/W2081438904,"Background and Aims In an attempt to further investigate the role of cannabinoid (CB) system in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases, we employed two recently developed ligands, AM841 (a covalently acting CB agonist) and CB13 (a peripherally-restricted CB agonist) to establish whether central and peripheral CB sites are involved in the anti-inflammatory action in the intestine. Methods and Results AM841 (0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly decreased inflammation scores in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-treated mice when administered before induction of colitis or as a treatment of existing intestinal inflammation. The effect was absent in CB1, CB2 and CB1/2-deficient mice. A peripherally-restricted agonist CB13 did not alleviate colitis when given i.p. (0.1 mg/kg), but significantly decreased inflammation score after central administration (0.1 µg/animal). Conclusions This is the first evidence that central and peripheral CB receptors are responsible for the protective and therapeutic action of cannabinoids in mouse models of colitis. Our observations provide new insight to CB pharmacology and validate the use of novel ligands AM841 and CB13 as potent tools in CB-related research."
https://openalex.org/W2047188873,"In this article we investigate the heat and mass transfer analysis in mixed convective radiative flow of Jeffrey fluid over a moving surface. The effects of thermal and concentration stratifications are also taken into consideration. Rosseland's approximations are utilized for thermal radiation. The nonlinear boundary layer partial differential equations are converted into nonlinear ordinary differential equations via suitable dimensionless variables. The solutions of nonlinear ordinary differential equations are developed by homotopic procedure. Convergence of homotopic solutions is examined graphically and numerically. Graphical results of dimensionless velocity, temperature and concentration are presented and discussed in detail. Values of the skin-friction coefficient, the local Nusselt and the local Sherwood numbers are analyzed numerically. Temperature and concentration profiles are decreased when the values of thermal and concentration stratifications parameters increase. Larger values of radiation parameter lead to the higher temperature and thicker thermal boundary layer thickness."
https://openalex.org/W2058222111,"Deletion of GnT-V (MGAT5), which synthesizes N-glycans with β(1,6)-branched glycans, reduced the compartment of cancer stem cells (CSC) in the her-2 mouse model of breast cancer, leading to delay of tumor onset. Because GnT-V levels are also commonly up-regulated in colon cancer, we investigated their regulation of colon CSC and adenoma development. Anchorage-independent cell growth and tumor formation induced by injection of colon tumor cells into NOD/SCID mice were positively associated with GnT-V levels, indicating regulation of proliferation and tumorigenicity. Using Apc(min/+) mice with different GnT-V backgrounds, knock-out of GnT-V had no significant effect on the number of adenoma/mouse, but adenoma size was significantly reduced and accompanied increased survival of Apc(min/+) mice with GnT-V deletion (p < 0.01), suggesting an inhibition in the progression of colon adenoma caused by deletion of GnT-V. Decreased expression levels of GnT-V down-regulated the population of colon (intestine) CSC, affecting their ability for self-renewal and tumorigenicity in NOD/SCID mice. Furthermore, altered nuclear translocation of β-catenin and expression of Wnt target genes were positively associated with expression levels of GnT-V, indicating the regulation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. By overexpressing the Wnt receptor, FZD-7, in colon cancer cells, we found that FZD-7 receptors expressed N-linked β(1,6) branching, indicating that FZD-7 can be modified by GnT-V. The aberrant Wnt signaling observed after modulating GnT-V levels is likely to result from altered N-linked β(1,6) branching on FZD-7, thereby affecting Wnt signaling, the compartment of CSC, and tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2007116522,"Introduction Resting energy expenditure (REE) is expected to be higher in athletes because of their relatively high fat free mass (FFM). Therefore, REE predictive equation for recreational athletes may be required. The aim of this study was to validate existing REE predictive equations and to develop a new recreational athlete specific equation. Methods 90 (53M, 37F) adult athletes, exercising on average 9.1±5.0 hours a week and 5.0±1.8 times a week, were included. REE was measured using indirect calorimetry (Vmax Encore n29), FFM and FM were measured using air displacement plethysmography. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to develop a new FFM-based and weight-based REE predictive equation. The percentage accurate predictions (within 10% of measured REE), percentage bias, root mean square error and limits of agreement were calculated. Results The Cunningham equation and the new weight-based equation and the new FFM-based equation performed equally well. De Lorenzo's equation predicted REE less accurate, but better than the other generally used REE predictive equations. Harris-Benedict, WHO, Schofield, Mifflin and Owen all showed less than 50% accuracy. Conclusion For a population of (Dutch) recreational athletes, the REE can accurately be predicted with the existing Cunningham equation. Since body composition measurement is not always possible, and other generally used equations fail, the new weight-based equation is advised for use in sports nutrition."
https://openalex.org/W2034590394,"Due to the potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF, Glomeromycota) to improve plant growth and soil quality, the influence of agricultural practice on their diversity continues to be an important research question. Up to now studies of community diversity in AMF have exclusively been based on nuclear ribosomal gene regions, which in AMF show high intra-organism polymorphism, seriously complicating interpretation of these data. We designed specific PCR primers for 454 sequencing of a region of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II gene, and established a new reference dataset comprising all major AMF lineages. This gene is known to be monomorphic within fungal isolates but shows an excellent barcode gap between species. We designed a primer set to amplify all known lineages of AMF and demonstrated its applicability in combination with high-throughput sequencing in a long-term tillage experiment. The PCR primers showed a specificity of 99.94% for glomeromycotan sequences. We found evidence of significant shifts of the AMF communities caused by soil management and showed that tillage effects on different AMF taxa are clearly more complex than previously thought. The high resolving power of high-throughput sequencing highlights the need for quantitative measurements to efficiently detect these effects."
https://openalex.org/W1973908782,"Recombinant human Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (rhG-CSF) supplementation seems to be a promising innovative therapy in reproductive medicine, used in case of recurrent miscarriage, embryo implantation failure or thin endometrium, although its mechanisms of action remain unknown. Our aim was to identify possible endometrial pathways influenced by rhG-CSF.Hypothetical molecular interactions regulated by G-CSF were designed through a previous large scale endometrial microarray study. The variation of endometrial expression of selected target genes was confirmed in control and infertile patients. G-CSF supplementation influence on these targets was tested on an endometrial ex-vivo culture. Middle luteal phase endometrial biopsies were cultured on collagen sponge with or without rhG-CSF supplementation during 3 consecutive days. Variations of endometrial mRNA expression for the selected targets were studied by RT-PCR.At the highest dose of rhG-CSF stimulation, the mRNA expression of these selected target genes was significantly increased if compared with their expression without addition of rhG-CSF. The selected targets were G-CSF Receptor (G-CSFR), Integrin alpha-V/beta-3 (ITGB3) implicated in cell migration and embryo implantation, Plasminogen Activator Urokinase Receptor (PLAUR) described as interacting with integrins and implicated in cell migration, Thymidine Phosphorylase (TYMP) implicated in local angiogenesis, CD40 and its ligand CD40L involved in cell proliferation control.RhG-CSF seems able to influence endometrial expressions crucial for implantation process involving endometrial vascular remodelling, local immune modulation and cellular adhesion pathways. These variations observed in an ex-vivo model should be tested in-vivo. The strict indications or counter indication of rhG-CSF supplementation in reproductive field are not yet established, while the safety of its administration in early pregnancy on early embryogenesis still needs to be demonstrated. Nevertheless, rhG-CSF appears as a promising therapy in some difficult and unsolved cases of reproductive failure. Indications of pre-conceptual rhG-CSF supplementation may derive from a diagnosed lack of endometrial expression of some target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2075343643,"The common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is one of the most important food legumes, far ahead of other legumes. The average grain yield of the common bean worldwide is much lower than its potential yields, primarily due to drought in the field. However, the gene network that mediates plant responses to drought stress remains largely unknown in this species. The major goals of our study are to identify a large scale of genes involved in drought stress using RNA-seq. First, we assembled 270 million high-quality trimmed reads into a non-redundant set of 62,828 unigenes, representing approximately 49 Mb of unique transcriptome sequences. Of these unigenes, 26,501 (42.2%) common bean unigenes had significant similarity with unigenes/predicted proteins from other legumes or sequenced plants. All unigenes were functionally annotated within the GO, COG and KEGG pathways. The strategy for de novo assembly of transcriptome data generated here will be useful in other legume plant transcriptome studies. Second, we identified 10,482 SSRs and 4,099 SNPs in transcripts. The large number of genetic markers provides a resource for gene discovery and development of functional molecular markers. Finally, we found differential expression genes (DEGs) between terminal drought and optimal irrigation treatments and between the two different genotypes Long 22-0579 (drought tolerant) and Naihua (drought sensitive). DEGs were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR assays, which indicated that these genes are functionally associated with the drought-stress response. These resources will be helpful for basic and applied research for genome analysis and crop drought resistance improvement in the common bean."
https://openalex.org/W2000786976,"Astrocytes fulfill a central role in regulating K+ and glutamate, both released by neurons into the extracellular space during activity. Glial glutamate uptake is a secondary active process that involves the influx of three Na+ ions and one proton and the efflux of one K+ ion. Thus, intracellular K+ concentration ([K+]i) is potentially influenced both by extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o) fluctuations and glutamate transport in astrocytes. We evaluated the impact of these K+ ion movements on [K+]i in primary mouse astrocytes by microspectrofluorimetry. We established a new noninvasive and reliable approach to monitor and quantify [K+]i using the recently developed K+ sensitive fluorescent indicator Asante Potassium Green-1 (APG-1). An in situ calibration procedure enabled us to estimate the resting [K+]i at 133±1 mM. We first investigated the dependency of [K+]i levels on [K+]o. We found that [K+]i followed [K+]o changes nearly proportionally in the range 3–10 mM, which is consistent with previously reported microelectrode measurements of intracellular K+ concentration changes in astrocytes. We then found that glutamate superfusion caused a reversible drop of [K+]i that depended on the glutamate concentration with an apparent EC50 of 11.1±1.4 µM, corresponding to the affinity of astrocyte glutamate transporters. The amplitude of the [K+]i drop was found to be 2.3±0.1 mM for 200 µM glutamate applications. Overall, this study shows that the fluorescent K+ indicator APG-1 is a powerful new tool for addressing important questions regarding fine [K+]i regulation with excellent spatial resolution."
https://openalex.org/W1963930674,"Microglia and astrocytes play important role in maintaining the homeostasis of central nervous system (CNS). Several CNS impacts have been postulated to be associated with radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields exposure. Given the important role of inflammation in neural physiopathologic processes, we investigated the pro-inflammatory responses of microglia and astrocytes and the involved mechanism in response to RF fields. Microglial N9 and astroglial C8-D1A cells were exposed to 1800 MHz RF for different time with or without pretreatment with STAT3 inhibitor. Microglia and astrocytes were activated by RF exposure indicated by up-regulated CD11b and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). However, RF exposure induced differential pro-inflammatory responses in astrocytes and microglia, characterized by different expression and release profiles of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, PGE2, nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2). Moreover, the RF exposure activated STAT3 in microglia but not in astrocytes. Furthermore, the STAT3 inhibitor Stattic ameliorated the RF-induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in microglia but not in astrocytes. Our results demonstrated that RF exposure differentially induced pro-inflammatory responses in microglia and astrocytes, which involved differential activation of STAT3 in microglia and astrocytes. Our data provide novel insights into the potential mechanisms of the reported CNS impacts associated with mobile phone use and present STAT3 as a promising target to protect humans against increasing RF exposure."
https://openalex.org/W1971563688,"Objective Neurobiological models of depression posit limbic hyperactivity that should normalize after successful treatment. For psychotherapy, though, brain changes in patients with depression show substantial variability. Two critical issues in relevant studies concern the use of unspecific stimulation experiments and relatively short treatment protocols. Therefore changes in brain reactions to individualized stimuli were studied in patients with depression after eight months of psychodynamic psychotherapy. Methods 18 unmedicated patients with recurrent major depressive disorder were confronted with individualized and clinically derived content in a functional MRI experiment before (T1) and after eight months (T2) of psychodynamic therapy. A control group of 17 healthy subjects was also tested twice without intervention. The experimental stimuli were sentences describing each participant's dysfunctional interpersonal relationship patterns derived from clinical interviews based on Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnostics (OPD). Results At T1 patients showed enhanced activation compared to controls in several limbic and subcortical regions, including amygdala and basal ganglia, when confronted with OPD sentences. At T2 the differences in brain activity between patients and controls were no longer apparent. Concurrently, patients had improved significantly in depression scores. Conclusions Using ecologically valid stimuli, this study supports the model of limbic hyperactivity in depression that normalizes after treatment. Without a control group of untreated patients measured twice, though, changes in patients' brain activity could also be attributed to other factors than psychodynamic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2059709859,"Central nervous system (CNS) administration of angiotensin II (Ang II) raises blood pressure (BP). The rise in BP reflects increased sympathetic outflow and a slower neuromodulatory pressor mechanism mediated by CNS mineralocorticoid receptors (MR). We investigated the hypothesis that the sustained phase of hypertension is associated also with elevated circulating levels of endogenous ouabain (EO), and chronic stimulation of arterial calcium transport proteins including the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX1), the type 6 canonical transient receptor potential protein (TRPC6), and the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA2). Wistar rats received a chronic intra-cerebroventricular infusion of vehicle (C) or Ang II (A, 2.5 ng/min, for 14 days) alone or combined with the MR blocker, eplerenone (A+E, 5 µg/day), or the aldosterone synthase inhibitor, FAD286 (A+F, 25 µg/day). Conscious mean BP increased (P<0.05) in A (123±4 mm Hg) vs all other groups. Blood, pituitary and adrenal samples were taken for EO radioimmunoassay (RIA), and aortas for NCX1, TRPC6 and SERCA2 immunoblotting. Central infusion of Ang II raised plasma EO (0.58±0.08 vs C 0.34±0.07 nM (P<0.05), but not in A + E and A + F groups as confirmed by off-line liquid chromatography (LC)-RIA and LC-multistage mass spectrometry. Two novel isomers of EO were elevated by Ang II; the second less polar isomer increased >50-fold in the A+F group. Central Ang II increased arterial expression of NCX1, TRPC6 and SERCA2 (2.6, 1.75 and 3.7-fold, respectively; P<0.01)) but not when co-infused with E or F. Adrenal and pituitary EO were unchanged. We conclude that brain Ang II activates a CNS-humoral axis involving plasma EO. The elevated EO reprograms peripheral ion transport pathways known to control arterial Na+ and Ca2+ homeostasis; this increases contractility and augments sympathetic effects. The new axis likely contributes to the chronic pressor effect of brain Ang II."
https://openalex.org/W2059492864,"The mechanisms causing cognitive problems in chronic pain patients are not well understood. We used the Stroop color word task (SCWT) to investigate distraction-induced analgesia, cognitive performance, and cerebral activation patterns in 29 fibromyalgia (FM) patients (mean age 49.8 years, range 25–64 years) and 31 healthy controls (HC) (mean age 46.3 years, range 20–63 years). In the first study, SCWT was used to investigate distraction-induced analgesia in FM patients. Two versions of the task were applied, one with only congruent color-word images and one with incongruent images. Pressure pain thresholds were assessed using a pressure algometer before, during, and following SCWT. In the second study, reaction times (RTs) were assessed and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate cerebral activation patterns in FM patients and HC during the SCWT. An event-related task mixing incongruent and congruent images was used. In study one, we found reduced pressure pain sensitivity during SCWT in both groups alike and no statistically significant differences were seen between the incongruent and congruent conditions. The study two revealed longer RTs during the incongruent compared to the congruent condition in both groups. FM patients had longer RTs than HC in both conditions. Furthermore, we found a significant interaction between group and congruency; that is, the group differences in RTs were more pronounced during the incongruent condition. This was reflected in a reduced activation of the caudate nucleus, lingual gyrus, temporal areas, and the hippocampus in FM patients compared to HC. In conclusion, we found normal pain inhibition during SWTC in FM patients. The cognitive difficulties seen in FM patients, reflected in longer RTs, were related to reduced activation of the caudate nucleus and hippocampus during incongruent SCWT, which most likely affected the mechanisms of cognitive learning in FM patients."
https://openalex.org/W1982567944,"Two critical cysteine residues in the copper-A site (CuA) on subunit II (CoxB) of bacterial cytochrome c oxidase lie on the periplasmic side of the cytoplasmic membrane. As the periplasm is an oxidizing environment as compared with the reducing cytoplasm, the prediction was that a disulfide bond formed between these cysteines must be eliminated by reduction prior to copper insertion. We show here that a periplasmic thioredoxin (TlpA) acts as a specific reductant not only for the Cu2+ transfer chaperone ScoI but also for CoxB. The dual role of TlpA was documented best with high-resolution crystal structures of the kinetically trapped TlpA-ScoI and TlpA-CoxB mixed disulfide intermediates. They uncovered surprisingly disparate contact sites on TlpA for each of the two protein substrates. The equilibrium of CoxB reduction by TlpA revealed a thermodynamically favorable reaction, with a less negative redox potential of CoxB (E′0 = −231 mV) as compared with that of TlpA (E′0 = −256 mV). The reduction of CoxB by TlpA via disulfide exchange proved to be very fast, with a rate constant of 8.4 × 104 m−1 s−1 that is similar to that found previously for ScoI reduction. Hence, TlpA is a physiologically relevant reductase for both ScoI and CoxB. Although the requirement of ScoI for assembly of the CuA-CoxB complex may be bypassed in vivo by high environmental Cu2+ concentrations, TlpA is essential in this process because only reduced CoxB can bind copper ions.

https://openalex.org/W1994511246,"In practical applications of computed tomography (CT) imaging, due to the risk of high radiation dose imposed on the patients, it is desired that high quality CT images can be accurately reconstructed from limited projection data. While with limited projections, the images reconstructed often suffer severe artifacts and the edges of the objects are blurred. In recent years, the compressed sensing based reconstruction algorithm has attracted major attention for CT reconstruction from a limited number of projections. In this paper, to eliminate the streak artifacts and preserve the edge structure information of the object, we present a novel iterative reconstruction algorithm based on weighted total difference (WTD) minimization, and demonstrate the superior performance of this algorithm. The WTD measure enforces both the sparsity and the directional continuity in the gradient domain, while the conventional total difference (TD) measure simply enforces the gradient sparsity horizontally and vertically. To solve our WTD-based few-view CT reconstruction model, we use the soft-threshold filtering approach. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the efficiency and the feasibility of our algorithm. For a typical slice of FORBILD head phantom, using 40 projections in the experiments, our algorithm outperforms the TD-based algorithm with more than 60% gains in terms of the root-mean-square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square distance (NRMSD) and normalized mean absolute distance (NMAD) measures and with more than 10% gains in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) measure. While for the experiments of noisy projections, our algorithm outperforms the TD-based algorithm with more than 15% gains in terms of the RMSE, NRMSD and NMAD measures and with more than 4% gains in terms of the PSNR measure.

Several signaling pathways, including cAMP–PKA and mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are involved in the infection-related morphogenesis and pathogenicity of C. orbiculare. However, upstream regulators of these pathways for this species remain unidentified. In this study, CoIRA1, encoding RAS GTPase activating protein, was identified by screening the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (AtMT) mutant, which was defective in the pathogenesis of C. orbiculare. The coira1 disrupted mutant showed an abnormal infection-related morphogenesis and attenuated pathogenesis. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ira1/2 inactivates Ras1/2, which activates adenylate cyclase, leading to the synthesis of cAMP. Increase in the intracellular cAMP levels in coira1 mutants and dominant active forms of CoRAS2 introduced transformants indicated that CoIra1 regulates intracellular cAMP levels through CoRas2. Moreover, the phenotypic analysis of transformants that express dominant active form CoRAS2 in the comekk1 mutant or a dominant active form CoMEKK1 in the coras2 mutant indicated that CoRas2 regulates the MAPK CoMekk1–Cmk1 signaling pathway. The CoRas2 localization pattern in vegetative hyphae of the coira1 mutant was similar to that of the wild-type, expressing a dominant active form of RFP–CoRAS2. Moreover, we demonstrated that bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) signals between CoIra1 and CoRas2 were detected in the plasma membrane of vegetative hyphae. Therefore, it is likely that CoIra1 negatively regulates CoRas2 in vegetative hyphae. Furthermore, cytological analysis of the localization of CoIraI and CoRas2 revealed the dynamic cellular localization of the proteins that leads to proper assembly of F-actin at appressorial pore required for successful penetration peg formation through the pore. Thus, our results indicated that CoIra1 is involved in infection-related morphogenesis and pathogenicity by proper regulation of cAMP and MAPK signaling pathways through CoRas2."
https://openalex.org/W2084870201,"Ever since iron oxide nanoparticles have been recognized as promising scaffolds for biomedical applications, their surface functionalization has become even more important. We report the synthesis of a novel polyethylene glycol-based ligand that combines multiple advantageous properties for these applications. The ligand is covalently bound to the surface via a siloxane group, while its polyethylene glycol backbone significantly improves the colloidal stability of the particle in complex environments. End-capping the molecule with a carboxylic acid introduces a variety of coupling chemistry possibilities. In this study an antibody targeting plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 was coupled to the surface and its presence and binding activity was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and surface plasmon resonance experiments. The results indicate that the ligand has high potential towards biomedical applications where colloidal stability and advanced functionality is crucial."
https://openalex.org/W1996750559,"The function of selenium-binding protein 1 (SBP1), present in almost all organisms, has not yet been established. In mammals, SBP1 is known to bind the essential element selenium but the binding site has not been identified. In addition, the SBP family has numerous potential metal-binding sites that may play a role in detoxification pathways in plants. In Arabidopsis thaliana, AtSBP1 over-expression increases tolerance to two toxic compounds for plants, selenium and cadmium, often found as soil pollutants. For a better understanding of AtSBP1 function in detoxification mechanisms, we investigated the chelating properties of the protein toward different ligands with a focus on selenium using biochemical and biophysical techniques. Thermal shift assays together with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed that AtSBP1 binds selenium after incubation with selenite (SeO32−) with a ligand to protein molar ratio of 1:1. Isothermal titration calorimetry confirmed the 1:1 stoichiometry and revealed an unexpectedly large value of binding enthalpy suggesting a covalent bond between selenium and AtSBP1. Titration of reduced Cys residues and comparative mass spectrometry on AtSBP1 and the purified selenium-AtSBP1 complex identified Cys21 and Cys22 as being responsible for the binding of one selenium. These results were validated by site-directed mutagenesis. Selenium K-edge x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy performed on the selenium-AtSBP1 complex demonstrated that AtSBP1 reduced SeO32− to form a R-S-Se(II)-S-R-type complex. The capacity of AtSBP1 to bind different metals and selenium is discussed with respect to the potential function of AtSBP1 in detoxification mechanisms and selenium metabolism.

Selenium dietary consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of many diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. In addition, a lack of selenium can lead to Keshin-Beck and Keshan disease that can be treated by selenium supplementation (3.Mehdi Y. Hornick J.L. Istasse L. Dufrasne I.

In organisms where selenium is an essential nutrient, it is required for the biosynthesis of the selenoamino acid selenium-Cys, used for the translation of 25 selenoproteins, which are involved in critical functions such as redox reactions, free radical scavenging, and hormone regulation (1.Behne D.

In addition to its role as a micronutrient, selenium can have toxic effects. Selenium toxicity (selenosis) can occur in some areas where exploitation of seleniferous soils or fossil fuels leads to toxic accumulation of selenium in the environment and in plants. In mammals, excess selenium targets the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, and hematopoietic systems (3.Mehdi Y. Hornick J.L. Istasse L. Dufrasne I.

Selenium uptake, translocation, assimilation and metabolic fate in plants.Photosynth Res. 2005; 86: 373-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). As the line between selenium deficiency and toxicity is very narrow, both selenium deficiency and selenium toxicity are common problems worldwide. Selenium concentration in soils ranges from 0.01 to 2 mg/kg and can be >10 mg/kg in seleniferous soils (3.Mehdi Y. Hornick J.L. Istasse L. Dufrasne I.

When present in soil, selenium is absorbed and accumulated in plants and is subsequently disseminated along the whole food chain. In this context, plants may help to alleviate both selenium deficiency and toxicity problems. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the plant response to selenium including accumulation, protection, and sequestration can be considered as one of the most important challenges in the coming decades. Engineering plants with nutrient-enriched content for biofortification, using plants to remove toxic selenium for phytoremediation and selecting for selenium resistant plants are critical goals (5.Zhu Y.G. Pilon-Smits E.A. Zhao F.J. Williams P.N. Meharg A.A.

LeDuc D.L. Phytoremediation of selenium using transgenic plants.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2009; 20: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The impact of selenium on plant physiology has been extensively studied. Selenium is not essential to land plants, unlike in mammals. Plant homologues to selenoproteins from mammals and bacteria have a Cys residue in their sequence instead of selenocysteine. However, low concentrations of selenium can have a positive effect on plant growth and be beneficial in facing biotic and abiotic stress (9.Feng R.W. Wei C.Y. Tu S.X. The roles of selenium in protecting plants against abiotic stresses.Environ. Exp. Bot. 2013; 87: 58-68Crossref Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 10.Pilon-Smits E.A. Quinn C.F. Tapken W. Malagoli M. Schiavon M. Physiological functions of beneficial elements.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2009; 12: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) notably by protecting plants against oxidative stress. At higher concentrations, selenium is generally highly toxic to plants. The major forms of inorganic selenium in soils are Se(VI) (SeO42−) and Se(IV) (SeO32−), which are taken up by roots via sulfate and phosphate transporters, respectively (6.Ellis D.R. Salt D.E. Plants, selenium and human health.Curr. Opin. Plant. Biol. 2003; 6: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 11.Terry N. Zayed A.M. De Souza M.P. Tarun A.S. Selenium in higher plants.Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 401-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Once inside the cells, selenium toxicity results from its chemical similarity with sulfur that leads to nonspecific replacement of sulfur containing amino acids with their seleno derivatives (7.Sors T.G. Ellis D.R. Salt D.E. Selenium uptake, translocation, assimilation and metabolic fate in plants.Photosynth Res. 2005; 86: 373-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 12.Van Hoewyk D.

In addition, at high concentrations, selenium triggers oxidative stress by reducing the pool of glutathione (GSH) (12.Van Hoewyk D. A tale of two toxicities: malformed selenoproteins and oxidative stress both contribute to selenium stress in plants.Ann. Bot. 2013; 112: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The main mechanisms of selenium tolerance in plants are the conversion of SeMet and SeCys into their methylated forms, which are non-incorporable into proteins, and volatilization (5.Zhu Y.G. Pilon-Smits E.A. Zhao F.J. Williams P.N. Meharg A.A.

LeDuc D.L. Phytoremediation of selenium using transgenic plants.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2009; 20: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In addition to its incorporation into selenoproteins, selenium can be bound to proteins belonging to the selenium-binding protein family (SBP). 3The abbreviations used are: SBPselenium-binding proteinTSAthermal shift assayICP-MSinductively coupled plasma mass spectrometryXANESK–edge X ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopyDTNB5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)GSHGlutathioneITCisothermal titration calorimetry. Many of the beneficial impacts of selenium on mammalian health have been attributed to its role as a critical constituent of selenoproteins and to its binding to SBP1. Although the function of selenoproteins is well established, the activity of SBP1 proteins is still unclear and the link between selenium binding and SBP1 function has not yet been determined. Mammalian SBP1 was first identified in mouse liver (14.Bansal M.P. Mukhopadhyay T. Scott J. Cook R.G. Mukhopadhyay R. Medina D.

Two homologues are present in humans. Today, SBP genes have been identified in many organisms including plants (14.Bansal M.P. Mukhopadhyay T. Scott J. Cook R.G. Mukhopadhyay R. Medina D.

In the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, 3 genes encoding SBP are present (16.Flemetakis E. Agalou A. Kavroulakis N. Dimou M. Martsikovskaya A. Slater A. Spaink H.P. Roussis A. Katinakis P. Lotus japonicus gene Ljsbp is highly conserved among plants and animals and encodes a homologue to the mammalian selenium-binding proteins.Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2002; 15: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). AtSBP1 is the isoform that is the most highly expressed (35.Dutilleul C. Jourdain A. Bourguignon J. Hugouvieux V. The Arabidopsis putative selenium-binding protein family: expression study and characterization of SBP1 as a potential new player in cadmium detoxification processes.Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). One of the first functions that was assigned to SBP1 in plants was a putative role in selenium tolerance (15.Agalou A. Roussis A. Spaink H.P. The Arabidopsis selenium-binding protein confers tolerance to toxic levels of selenium.Funct. Plant Biol. 2005; 32: 881-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Indeed, plants over-expressing AtSBP1 have increased resistance to selenite (SeO32−), whereas reducing AtSBP1 and AtSBP2 expression increased plant sensitivity to the toxic compound (15.Agalou A. Roussis A. Spaink H.P. The Arabidopsis selenium-binding protein confers tolerance to toxic levels of selenium.Funct. Plant Biol. 2005; 32: 881-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). AtSBP1 could therefore be involved in selenium metabolism but no reports were available in the literature on the ability of AtSBP1 to bind selenium like its mammalian homologues. In addition to its putative role in selenium tolerance, AtSBP1 has been identified as a protein accumulating in response to the heavy metal cadmium in A. thaliana cultured cells using differential proteomic analysis (36.Sarry J.E. Kuhn L. Ducruix C. Lafaye A. Junot C. Hugouvieux V. Jourdain A. Bastien O. Fievet J.B. Vailhen D. Amekraz B. Moulin C. Ezan E. Garin J. Bourguignon J. The early responses of Arabidopsis thaliana cells to cadmium exposure explored by protein and metabolite profiling analyses.Proteomics. 2006; 6: 2180-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Cadmium is toxic to most organisms and is one of the most toxic pollutants in the world. One of the main mechanisms that plants use to face cadmium toxicity is the synthesis of polymers of GSH, called phytochelatines, that chelate cadmium and are then transferred into the vacuoles (37.Pal R. Rai J.P. Phytochelatins: peptides involved in heavy metal detoxification.Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 2010; 160: 945-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). AtSBP1 shows the ability to bind 3 cadmium in vitro and AtSBP1 over-expression in A. thaliana seedlings led to enhanced tolerance to cadmium (35.Dutilleul C. Jourdain A. Bourguignon J. Hugouvieux V. The Arabidopsis putative selenium-binding protein family: expression study and characterization of SBP1 as a potential new player in cadmium detoxification processes.Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This phenotype is more important in GSH- and phytochelatine-deficient Arabidopsis seedlings (35.Dutilleul C. Jourdain A. Bourguignon J. Hugouvieux V. The Arabidopsis putative selenium-binding protein family: expression study and characterization of SBP1 as a potential new player in cadmium detoxification processes.Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, AtSBP1 may have chelating properties in vivo toward cadmium and may represent a new detoxification mechanism that plants use to face heavy metal toxicity, possibly throught direct binding to the metal (35.Dutilleul C. Jourdain A. Bourguignon J. Hugouvieux V. The Arabidopsis putative selenium-binding protein family: expression study and characterization of SBP1 as a potential new player in cadmium detoxification processes.Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition to cadmium, AtSBP1 over-expressing A. thaliana plants showed increased tolerance to stress such as selenium and H2O2 that also require GSH for detoxification (38.Hugouvieux V. Dutilleul C. Jourdain A. Reynaud F. Lopez V. Bourguignon J. Arabidopsis putative selenium-binding protein1 expression is tightly linked to cellular sulfur demand and can reduce sensitivity to stresses requiring glutathione for tolerance.Plant Physiol. 2009; 151: 768-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Overexpression of OsSBP1 in rice enhanced tolerance to various pathogens (17.Sawada K. Hasegawa M. Tokuda L. Kameyama J. Kodama O. Kohchi T. Yoshida K. Shinmyo A. Enhanced resistance to blast fungus and bacterial blight in transgenic rice constitutively expressing OsSBP, a rice homologue of mammalian selenium-binding proteins.Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the importance of GSH in plant defense to biotic stress has been recently reviewed (39.Noctor G. Mhamdi A. Chaouch S. Han Y. Neukermans J. Marquez-Garcia B. Queval G. Foyer C.H. Glutathione in plants: an integrated overview.Plant Cell Environ. 2012; 35: 454-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). These results suggest that SBP1 may share similar functions with GSH in response to stress. In line with these results, stresses inducing SBP1 expression were also inducers of PRH43, which encodes 5′-adenylylphosphosulfate reductase 2, a key enzyme of the sulfur assimilation pathway and GSH biosynthesis (38.Hugouvieux V. Dutilleul C. Jourdain A. Reynaud F. Lopez V. Bourguignon J. Arabidopsis putative selenium-binding protein1 expression is tightly linked to cellular sulfur demand and can reduce sensitivity to stresses requiring glutathione for tolerance.Plant Physiol. 2009; 151: 768-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As an example, AtSBP1 and AtPRH43 are induced by cadmium, SeO42−, H2O2 and sulfur starvation. An internal sulfur demand of the cell could be a signal that triggers SBP1 expression in response to the different stresses (37.Pal R. Rai J.P. Phytochelatins: peptides involved in heavy metal detoxification.Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 2010; 160: 945-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and this correlates well with the potential functional redundancy between SBP1 and GSH. To date, all the data accumulated on SBP1 function in plants points to the importance of SBP1 in response to stress. The fact that AtSBP1 shows the ability to bind cadmium, a toxic metal, in vitro, and that the mammalian homologue can bind selenium in vivo, another toxic compound for plants, raises the question of whether AtSBP1 may have some chelating properties toward selenium as well as other metals in addition to cadmium. Because of the importance of selenium in human health, and the critical function of SBP1 in selenium tolerance in plants, we focused on the identification of the selenium-binding site in AtSBP1. By using complementary biochemical, spectroscopic, and biophysical approaches, we characterized the selenium and metal binding properties of AtSBP1. These data identify, for the first time, the selenium-binding site in any SBP1 homologues. Its characterization provides evidence that two Cys residues are involved in selenium binding and that AtSBP1 reduces selenite (SeO32−). This work provides an important step toward a better understanding of SBP1 function in selenium metabolism, detoxification, and accumulation mechanisms in plants. AtSBP1 cDNA contained in the entry clone (U15803, TAIR database) was cloned into the destination pGEX-3X for GST-AtSBP1 production as previously described (35.Dutilleul C. Jourdain A. Bourguignon J.

Despite being a central mediator of BMP canonical signaling pathway, inactivation of Smad4 in dental mesenchyme does not result in early developmental defects. In the current study, we investigated the mechanism of receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads) and Smad4 in the regulation of the odontogenic gene Msx1 expression in the dental mesenchyme. We showed that the canonical BMP signaling is not operating in the early developing tooth, as assessed by failed activation of the BRE-Gal transgenic allele and the absence of phospho-(p)Smad1/5/8-Smad4 complexes. The absence of pSmad1/5/8-Smad4 complex appeared to be the consequence of saturation of Smad4 by pSmad2/3 in the dental mesenchyme as knockdown of Smad2/3 or overexpression of Smad4 led to the formation of pSmad1/5/8-Smad4 complexes and activation of canonical BMP signaling in dental mesenchymal cells. We showed that Smad1/5 but not Smad4 are required for BMP-induced expression of Msx1 in dental mesenchymal cells. We further presented evidence that in the absence of Smad4, BMPs are still able to induce pSmad1/5/8 nuclear translocation and their binding to the Msx1 promoter directly in dental mesenchymal cells. Our results demonstrate the functional operation of an atypical canonical BMP signaling (Smad4-independent and Smad1/5/8-dependent) pathway in the dental mesenchyme during early odontogenesis, which may have general implication in the development of other organs."
https://openalex.org/W2031374671,"Metastasis is accountable for 90% of cancer deaths. During metastasis, tumor cells break away from the primary tumor, enter the blood and the lymph vessels, and use them as highways to travel to distant sites in the body to form secondary tumors. Cancer cell migration through the endothelium and into the basement membrane represents a critical step in the metastatic cascade, yet it is not well understood. This process is well characterized for immune cells that routinely transmigrate through the endothelium to sites of infection, inflammation, or injury. Previous studies with leukocytes have demonstrated that this step depends heavily on the activation status of the endothelium and subendothelial substrate stiffness. Here, we used a previously established in vitro model of the endothelium and live cell imaging, in order to observe cancer cell transmigration and compare this process to leukocytes. Interestingly, cancer cell transmigration includes an additional step, which we term ‘incorporation’, into the endothelial cell (EC) monolayer. During this phase, cancer cells physically displace ECs, leading to the dislocation of EC VE-cadherin away from EC junctions bordering cancer cells, and spread into the monolayer. In some cases, ECs completely detach from the matrix. Furthermore, cancer cell incorporation occurs independently of the activation status and the subendothelial substrate stiffness for breast cancer and melanoma cells, a notable difference from the process by which leukocytes transmigrate. Meanwhile, pancreatic cancer cell incorporation was dependent on the activation status of the endothelium and changed on very stiff subendothelial substrates. Collectively, our results provide mechanistic insights into tumor cell extravasation and demonstrate that incorporation is one of the earliest steps."

As reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a known source of damage to tissues of the inner ear following loud sound exposure, we examined the role of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT3 signaling pathway in noise induce hearing loss using the pathway specific inhibitor, JSI-124. Mice were exposed to a moderately damaging level of loud sound revealing the phosphorylation of STAT3 tyrosine 705 residues and nuclear localization in many cell types in the inner ear including the marginal cells of the stria vascularis, type II, III, and IV fibrocytes, spiral ganglion cells, and in the inner hair cells. Treatment of the mice with the JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor before noise exposure reduced levels of phosphorylated STAT3 Y705. We performed auditory brain stem response and distortion product otoacoustic emission measurements and found increased recovery of hearing sensitivity at two weeks after noise exposure with JAK2/STAT3 inhibition. Performance of cytocochleograms revealed improved outer hair cell survival in JSI-124 treated mice relative to control. Finally, JAK2/STAT3 inhibition reduced levels of ROS detected in outer hair cells at two hours post noise exposure. Together, these findings demonstrate that inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway is protective against noise-induced cochlear tissue damage and loss of hearing sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1975405640,"Background Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe and life-threatening acute lung injury (ALI) that is caused by noxious stimuli and pathogens. ALI is characterized by marked acute inflammation with elevated alveolar cytokine levels. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are involved in cytokine production, but the mechanisms that regulate these pathways remain poorly characterized. Here, we focused on the role of Sprouty-related EVH1-domain-containing protein (Spred)-2, a negative regulator of the Ras-Raf-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-MAPK pathway, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung inflammation. Methods Wild-type (WT) mice and Spred-2−/− mice were exposed to intratracheal LPS (50 µg in 50 µL PBS) to induce pulmonary inflammation. After LPS-injection, the lungs were harvested to assess leukocyte infiltration, cytokine and chemokine production, ERK-MAPK activation and immunopathology. For ex vivo experiments, alveolar macrophages were harvested from untreated WT and Spred-2−/− mice and stimulated with LPS. In in vitro experiments, specific knock down of Spred-2 by siRNA or overexpression of Spred-2 by transfection with a plasmid encoding the Spred-2 sense sequence was introduced into murine RAW264.7 macrophage cells or MLE-12 lung epithelial cells. Results LPS-induced acute lung inflammation was significantly exacerbated in Spred-2−/− mice compared with WT mice, as indicated by the numbers of infiltrating leukocytes, levels of alveolar TNF-α, CXCL2 and CCL2 in a later phase, and lung pathology. U0126, a selective MEK/ERK inhibitor, reduced the augmented LPS-induced inflammation in Spred-2−/− mice. Specific knock down of Spred-2 augmented LPS-induced cytokine and chemokine responses in RAW264.7 cells and MLE-12 cells, whereas Spred-2 overexpression decreased this response in RAW264.7 cells. Conclusions The ERK-MAPK pathway is involved in LPS-induced acute lung inflammation. Spred-2 controls the development of LPS-induced lung inflammation by negatively regulating the ERK-MAPK pathway. Thus, Spred-2 may represent a therapeutic target for the treatment of ALI."

Currently little transcriptomic and small RNAomic data are available to reveal the genes involve in the stress resistant in S. matsudana. Here, we report the RNA-seq analysis results of both transcriptome and small RNAome data using Illumina deep sequencing of shoot tips from two willow variants(Salix. matsudana and Salix matsudana Koidz. cultivar ‘Tortuosa’). De novo gene assembly was used to generate the consensus transcriptome and small RNAome, which contained 106,403 unique transcripts with an average length of 944 bp and a total length of 100.45 MB, and 166 known miRNAs representing 35 miRNA families. Comparison of transcriptomes and small RNAomes combined with quantitative real-time PCR from the two Salix libraries revealed a total of 292 different expressed genes(DEGs) and 36 different expressed miRNAs (DEMs). Among the DEGs and DEMs, 196 genes and 24 miRNAs were up regulated, 96 genes and 12 miRNA were down regulated in S. matsudana. Functional analysis of DEGs and miRNA targets showed that many genes were involved in stress resistance in S. matsudana. Our global gene expression profiling presents a comprehensive view of the transcriptome and small RNAome which provide valuable information and sequence resources for uncovering the stress response genes in S. matsudana. Moreover the transcriptome and small RNAome data provide a basis for future study of genetic resistance in Salix."
https://openalex.org/W2024184232,"The cellular and network basis for most vertebrate locomotor central pattern generators (CPGs) is incompletely characterized, but organizational models based on known CPG architectures have been proposed. Segmental models propose that each spinal segment contains a circuit that controls local coordination and sends longer projections to coordinate activity between segments. Unsegmented/continuous models propose that patterned motor output is driven by gradients of neurons and synapses that do not have segmental boundaries. We tested these ideas in the larval zebrafish, an animal that swims in discrete episodes, each of which is composed of coordinated motor bursts that progress rostrocaudally and alternate from side to side. We perturbed the spinal cord using spinal transections or strychnine application and measured the effect on fictive motor output. Spinal transections eliminated episode structure, and reduced both rostrocaudal and side-to-side coordination. Preparations with fewer intact segments were more severely affected, and preparations consisting of midbody and caudal segments were more severely affected than those consisting of rostral segments. In reduced preparations with the same number of intact spinal segments, side-to-side coordination was more severely disrupted than rostrocaudal coordination. Reducing glycine receptor signaling with strychnine reversibly disrupted both rostrocaudal and side-to-side coordination in spinalized larvae without disrupting episodic structure. Both spinal transection and strychnine decreased the stability of the motor rhythm, but this effect was not causal in reducing coordination. These results are inconsistent with a segmented model of the spinal cord and are better explained by a continuous model in which motor neuron coordination is controlled by segment-spanning microcircuits."
https://openalex.org/W2059577999,"Given that the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate is involved in cardiovascular pathophysiology, and since lipid accumulation and inflammation are hallmarks of calcific aortic stenosis, the role of sphingosine 1-phosphate on the pro-inflammatory/pro-osteogenic pathways in human interstitial cells from aortic and pulmonary valves was investigated. Real-time PCR showed sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor expression in aortic valve interstitial cells. Exposure of cells to sphingosine 1-phosphate induced pro-inflammatory responses characterized by interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and cyclooxygenase-2 up-regulations, as observed by ELISA and Western blot. Strikingly, cell treatment with sphingosine 1-phosphate plus lipopolysaccharide resulted in the synergistic induction of cyclooxygenase-2, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1, as well as the secretion of prostaglandin E2, the soluble form of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and the pro-angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor-A. Remarkably, the synergistic effect was significantly higher in aortic valve interstitial cells from stenotic than control valves, and was drastically lower in cells from pulmonary valves, which rarely undergo stenosis. siRNA and pharmacological analysis revealed the involvement of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors 1/3 and Toll-like receptor-4, and downstream signaling through p38/MAPK, protein kinase C, and NF-κB. As regards pro-osteogenic pathways, sphingosine 1-phosphate induced calcium deposition and the expression of the calcification markers bone morphogenetic protein-2 and alkaline phosphatase, and enhanced the effect of lipopolysaccharide, an effect that was partially blocked by inhibition of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors 3/2 signaling. In conclusion, the interplay between sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors and Toll-like receptor 4 signaling leads to a cooperative up-regulation of inflammatory, angiogenic, and osteogenic pathways in aortic valve interstitial cells that seems relevant to the pathogenesis of aortic stenosis and may allow the inception of new therapeutic approaches."

We made the same calculations on other PKA complexes that contain Kemptide derivatives (with mutations of the arginines, and with deletions of N and C-terminal amino acids). We predicted shifts in the free energy changes from the free PKA to PKA-substrate complex (ΔΔG(E→ES)) when Kemptide structure is modified (we consider that the calculated shifts correlate with the experimental shifts of the free energy changes from the free PKA to the transition states (ΔΔG(E→TS)) determined by the catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(M)) changes). Our results demonstrate that it is possible to predict the kinetic properties of protein kinases using simple computational biochemistry methods. As an additional benefit, these methods give detailed molecular information that permit the analysis of the atomic forces that contribute to the affinity between protein kinases and their substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1977182062,"Oxidative stress triggers the peroxidation of ω-6-polyunsaturated fatty acids to reactive lipid fragments, including (2E)-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE). We previously reported two parallel catabolic pathways of HNE. In this study, we report a novel metabolite that accumulates in rat liver perfused with HNE or 4-hydroxynonanoic acid (HNA), identified as 3-(5-oxotetrahydro-2-furanyl)propanoyl-CoA. In experiments using a combination of isotopic analysis and metabolomics studies, three catabolic pathways of HNE were delineated following HNE conversion to HNA. (i) HNA is ω-hydroxylated to 4,9-dihydroxynonanoic acid, which is subsequently oxidized to 4-hydroxynonanedioic acid. This is followed by the degradation of 4-hydroxynonanedioic acid via β-oxidation originating from C-9 of HNA breaking down to 4-hydroxynonanedioyl-CoA, 4-hydroxyheptanedioyl-CoA, or its lactone, 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA, and 2-ketoglutaric acid entering the citric acid cycle. (ii) ω-1-hydroxylation of HNA leads to 4,8-dihydroxynonanoic acid (4,8-DHNA), which is subsequently catabolized via two parallel pathways we previously reported. In catabolic pathway A, 4,8-DHNA is catabolized to 4-phospho-8-hydroxynonanoyl-CoA, 3,8-dihydroxynonanoyl-CoA, 6-hydroxyheptanoyl-CoA, 4-hydroxypentanoyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA. (iii) The catabolic pathway B of 4,8-DHNA leads to 2,6-dihydroxyheptanoyl-CoA, 5-hydroxyhexanoyl-CoA, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that HNE can be catabolically disposed via ω- and ω-1-oxidation in rat liver and kidney, with little activity in brain and heart. Dietary experiments showed that ω- and ω-1-hydroxylation of HNA in rat liver were dramatically up-regulated by a ketogenic diet, which lowered HNE basal level. HET0016 inhibition and mRNA expression level suggested that the cytochrome P450 4A are main enzymes responsible for the NADPH-dependent ω- and ω-1-hydroxylation of HNA/HNE."
https://openalex.org/W2012211581,"The porous polymer foams act as a template for neotissuegenesis in tissue engineering, and, as a reservoir for cell transplants such as pancreatic islets while simultaneously providing a functional interface with the host body. The fabrication of foams with the controlled shape, size and pore structure is of prime importance in various bioengineering applications. To this end, here we demonstrate a thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) based facile process for the fabrication of polymer foams with a controlled architecture. The setup comprises of a metallic template bar (T), a metallic conducting block (C) and a non-metallic reservoir tube (R), connected in sequence T-C-R. The process hereinafter termed as Dip TIPS, involves the dipping of the T-bar into a polymer solution, followed by filling of the R-tube with a freezing mixture to induce the phase separation of a polymer solution in the immediate vicinity of T-bar; Subsequent free-drying or freeze-extraction steps produced the polymer foams. An easy exchange of the T-bar of a spherical or rectangular shape allowed the fabrication of tubular, open- capsular and flat-sheet shaped foams. A mere change in the quenching time produced the foams with a thickness ranging from hundreds of microns to several millimeters. And, the pore size was conveniently controlled by varying either the polymer concentration or the quenching temperature. Subsequent in vivo studies in brown Norway rats for 4-weeks demonstrated the guided cell infiltration and homogenous cell distribution through the polymer matrix, without any fibrous capsule and necrotic core. In conclusion, the results show the “Dip TIPS” as a facile and adaptable process for the fabrication of anisotropic channeled porous polymer foams of various shapes and sizes for potential applications in tissue engineering, cell transplantation and other related fields."
https://openalex.org/W2143443405,"Vibrissa motoneurons in the facial nucleus innervate the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles that move the whiskers. Their intrinsic properties affect the way they process fast synaptic input from the vIRT and Bötzinger nuclei together with serotonergic neuromodulation. In response to constant current (Iapp) injection, vibrissa motoneurons may respond with mixed mode oscillations (MMOs), in which sub-threshold oscillations (STOs) are intermittently mixed with spikes. This study investigates the mechanisms involved in generating MMOs in vibrissa motoneurons and their function in motor control. It presents a conductance-based model that includes the M-type K+ conductance, gM, the persistent Na+ conductance, gNaP, and the cationic h conductance, gh. For gh = 0 and moderate values of gM and gNaP, the model neuron generates STOs, but not MMOs, in response to Iapp injection. STOs transform abruptly to tonic spiking as the current increases. In addition to STOs, MMOs are generated for gh>0 for larger values of Iapp; the Iapp range in which MMOs appear increases linearly with gh. In the MMOs regime, the firing rate increases with Iapp like a Devil's staircase. Stochastic noise disrupts the temporal structure of the MMOs, but for a moderate noise level, the coefficient of variation (CV) is much less than one and varies non-monotonically with Iapp. Furthermore, the estimated time period between voltage peaks, based on Bernoulli process statistics, is much higher in the MMOs regime than in the tonic regime. These two phenomena do not appear when moderate noise generates MMOs without an intrinsic MMO mechanism. Therefore, and since STOs do not appear in spinal motoneurons, the analysis can be used to differentiate different MMOs mechanisms. MMO firing activity in vibrissa motoneurons suggests a scenario in which moderate periodic inputs from the vIRT and Bötzinger nuclei control whisking frequency, whereas serotonergic neuromodulation controls whisking amplitude."
https://openalex.org/W2031995077,"Atrazine, metolachlor, carbaryl, and chlorothalonil are detected in streams throughout the U.S. at concentrations that may have adverse effects on benthic microbes. Sediment samples were exposed to these pesticides to quantify responses of ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate uptake by the benthic microbial community. Control uptake rates of sediments had net remineralization of nitrate (−1.58 NO3 µg gdm−1 h−1), and net assimilation of phosphate (1.34 PO4 µg gdm−1 h−1) and ammonium (0.03 NH4 µg gdm−1 h−1). Metolachlor decreased ammonium and phosphate uptake. Chlorothalonil decreased nitrate remineralization and phosphate uptake. Nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate uptake rates are more pronounced in the presence of these pesticides due to microbial adaptations to toxicants. Our interpretation of pesticide availability based on their water/solid affinities supports no effects for atrazine and carbaryl, decreasing nitrate remineralization, and phosphate assimilation in response to chlorothalonil. Further, decreased ammonium and phosphate uptake in response to metolachlor is likely due to affinity. Because atrazine target autotrophs, and carbaryl synaptic activity, effects on benthic microbes were not hypothesized, consistent with results. Metolachlor and chlorothalonil (non-specific modes of action) had significant effects on sediment microbial nutrient dynamics. Thus, pesticides with a higher affinity to sediments and/or broad modes of action are likely to affect sediment microbes' nutrient dynamics than pesticides dissolved in water or specific modes of action. Predicted nutrient uptake rates were calculated at mean and peak concentrations of metolachlor and chlorothalonil in freshwaters using polynomial equations generated in this experiment. We concluded that in natural ecosystems, peak chlorothalonil and metolachlor concentrations could affect phosphate and ammonium by decreasing net assimilation, and nitrate uptake rates by decreasing remineralization, relative to mean concentrations of metolachlor and chlorothalonil. Our regression equations can complement models of nitrogen and phosphorus availability in streams to predict potential changes in nutrient dynamics in response to pesticides in freshwaters."
https://openalex.org/W2171512261,"The indolamine melatonin (MEL) is described as an antioxidant and a free radical scavenger. However occasionally, the indoleamine has been reported to increase free radicals with insufficient mechanistic explanation. In an attempt to find a reason for those controversial results, a potential mechanism that explains MEL prooxidant activity is investigated. The current controversy about redox detection methods has prompted us to search a possible interaction between MEL and dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH2), perhaps the most widely fluorescence probe employed for free radicals detection in cellular models. Here, it is demonstrated that melatonin potentiates the photooxidation of DCFH2 in a cell-free system, increasing the production of its fluorescent metabolite. Indeed, MEL works as an antioxidant scavenging hydroxyl radicals in this system. Thus, this reaction between MEL and DCFH2 produces N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK), a biogenic amine with antioxidant properties too. This reaction is O2 and light dependent and it is prevented by antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine or ascorbic acid. Furthermore, when DCFH2 has been employed to evaluate antioxidant or prooxidant activities of MEL in cellular models it is confirmed that it works as an antioxidant but these results can be modulated by light misleading to a prooxidant conclusion. In conclusion, here is demonstrated that DCFH2, light and melatonin interact and results obtained using these fluorescence probes in studies with melatonin have to be carefully interpreted."
https://openalex.org/W1985406241,"Background The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is used in adults and children affected by a wide range of chronic diseases to evaluate their sub-maximal exercise capacity. It reflects the global response of various physiological systems in a situation simulating a daily life activity. Methods We analyzed factors affecting the 6MWT in 46 Sickle Cell Disease children. Forty-two were treated with hydroxyurea (HU). Patients with normal test (>80% of the age-standardized predicted value) were compared to patients with abnormal test (≤80%). Baseline hematological values, clinical events, cerebrovascular disease, cardio-pulmonary parameters and disease-modifying treatment were compared according to the performance of the test. Results Among the 46 patients, 14 had an abnormal 6MWT. In univariate analysis, both groups were similar for biological and clinical data. Six of the 14 patients with an abnormal 6MWT had silent infarct (SI) compared to 6/32 with a normal test (P = 0.09). When excluding chronically transfused patients, 4 of the 11 patients with an abnormal 6MWT had SI compared to 1/26 (P = 0.02). Baseline pulse oximetry was normal in both groups but slightly lower in patients with abnormal 6MWT (P = 0.02). No patient presented exercise-induced desaturation. In multivariate analysis, the only factor associated with abnormal 6MWT was the presence of SI (P = 0.045). Conclusions In our cohort of 46 patients characterized by high exposure rate to HU and by the absence of severe cardiopulmonary disease, the sole factor independently associated with 6MWT was the presence of SI. The lower exercise capacity of children with SI may reflect some subclinical neurological impairment as they do not differ by hemoglobin level or cardiopulmonary parameters."
https://openalex.org/W1970543375,"Non-coding small RNAs are involved in many physiological responses including viral life cycles. Adenovirus-encoding small RNAs, known as virus-associated RNAs (VA RNAs), are transcribed throughout the replication process in the host cells, and their transcript levels depend on the copy numbers of the viral genome. Therefore, VA RNAs are abundant in infected cells after genome replication, i.e. during the late phase of viral infection. Their function during the late phase is the inhibition of interferon-inducible protein kinase R (PKR) activity to prevent antiviral responses; recently, mivaRNAs, the microRNAs processed from VA RNAs, have been reported to inhibit cellular gene expression. Although VA RNA transcription starts during the early phase, little is known about its function. The reason may be because much smaller amount of VA RNAs are transcribed during the early phase than the late phase. In this study, we applied replication-deficient adenovirus vectors (AdVs) and novel AdVs lacking VA RNA genes to analyze the expression changes in cellular genes mediated by VA RNAs using microarray analysis. AdVs are suitable to examine the function of VA RNAs during the early phase, since they constitutively express VA RNAs but do not replicate except in 293 cells. We found that the expression level of hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) significantly decreased in response to the VA RNAs under replication-deficient condition, and this suppression was also observed during the early phase under replication-competent conditions. The suppression was independent of mivaRNA-induced downregulation, suggesting that the function of VA RNAs during the early phase differs from that during the late phase. Notably, overexpression of HDGF inhibited AdV growth. This is the first report to show the function, in part, of VA RNAs during the early phase that may be contribute to efficient viral growth."

Regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship with polysomnographic and spectral EEG power variables. Results The analysis did not provide any support for the a-priori formulated hypotheses of an association between brain morphology and polysomnographic variables. Exploratory analyses revealed that the thickness of the left caudal anterior cingulate cortex was positively associated with EEG beta2 power (24–32 Hz) during REM sleep. The volume of the left postcentral gyrus was positively associated with periodic leg movements during sleep (PLMS). Conclusions The function of the anterior cingulate cortex as well as EEG beta power during REM sleep have been related to dreaming and sleep-related memory consolidation, which may explain the observed correlation. Increased volumes of the postcentral gyrus may be the result of increased sensory input associated with PLMS. However, due to the exploratory nature of the corresponding analyses, these results have to be replicated before drawing firm conclusions."
https://openalex.org/W2074364733,"RAGE, receptor for advanced glycation endoproducts (AGE), has been characterized as an activator of osteoclastgenesis. However, whether RAGE directly regulates chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation is unclear. Here, we show that RAGE has an inhibitory role in chondrocyte differentiation. RAGE expression was observed in chondrocytes from the prehypertrophic to hypertrophic regions. In cultured cells, overexpression of RAGE or dominant-negative-RAGE (DN-RAGE) demonstrated that RAGE inhibited cartilaginous matrix production, while DN-RAGE promoted production. Additionally, RAGE regulated Ihh and Col10a1 negatively but upregulated PTHrP receptor. Ihh promoter analysis and real-time PCR analysis suggested that downregulation of Cdxs was the key for RAGE-induced inhibition of chondrocyte differentiation. Overexpression of the NF-κB inhibitor I-κB-SR inhibited RAGE-induced NF-κB activation, but did not influence inhibition of cartilaginous matrix production by RAGE. The inhibitory action of RAGE was restored by the Rho family GTPases inhibitor Toxin B. Furthermore, inhibitory action on Ihh, Col10a1 and Cdxs was reproduced by constitutively active forms, L63RhoA, L61Rac, and L61Cdc42, but not by I-κB-SR. Cdx1 induced Ihh and Col10a1 expressions and directly interacted with Ihh promoter. Retinoic acid (RA) partially rescued the inhibitory action of RAGE. These data combined suggests that RAGE negatively regulates chondrocyte differentiation at the prehypertrophic stage by modulating NF-κB-independent and Rho family GTPases-dependent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2148063880,"IL-32γ is a multifunctional cytokine involved in various inflammatory and auto-immune diseases in which neutrophils can affect the evolution of these diseases. To persist at inflammatory sites, neutrophils require inhibition of their rapid and constitutive apoptosis, an inhibitory effect that phlogogenic cytokines support. To date, the effects of IL-32γ on neutrophils remain unknown. We demonstrate that IL-32γ delays, in a dose-dependent manner, the spontaneous apoptosis of human blood neutrophils by activating mainly p38 MAPK through rapid p38 phosphorylation. PI3-K and ERK1/2 MAPK are also involved, but to a lesser extent. Most of cytokines that induce retardation of neutrophil apoptosis activate the expression of MCL-1 at both mRNA and protein levels. IL-32γ added to human blood neutrophils in vitro is associated with sustained levels of MCL-1 protein. This effect in neutrophils corresponds to a decrease of MCL-1 protein degradation without any effect on MCL-1 mRNA levels. The sustained levels of MCL-1 induced by IL-32γ are only abrogated by the p38β MAPK inhibitor SB202190. Additionally, IL-32γ induces a reduction in caspase 3 activity in neutrophils. In conclusion, IL-32γ affects human blood neutrophils in vitro by increasing their survival, suggesting that this cytokine could have profound effects on the deleterious functions of neutrophils in several diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2021704495,"Butanol (C4H10OH) has been used both to dissect the molecular targets of alcohols/general anesthetics and to implicate phospholipase D (PLD) signaling in a variety of cellular functions including neurotransmitter and hormone exocytosis. Like other primary alcohols, 1-butanol is a substrate for PLD and thereby disrupts formation of the intracellular signaling lipid phosphatidic acid. Because secondary and tertiary butanols do not undergo this transphosphatidylation, they have been used as controls for 1-butanol to implicate PLD signaling. Recently, selective pharmacological inhibitors of PLD have been developed and, in some cases, fail to block cellular functions previously ascribed to PLD using primary alcohols. For example, exocytosis of insulin and degranulation of mast cells are blocked by primary alcohols, but not by the PLD inhibitor FIPI. In this study we show that 1-butanol reduces catecholamine secretion from adrenal chromaffin cells to a much greater extent than tert-butanol, and that the PLD inhibitor VU0155056 has no effect. Using fluorescent imaging we show the effect of these drugs on depolarization-evoked calcium entry parallel those on secretion. Patch-clamp electrophysiology confirmed the peak amplitude of voltage-gated calcium channel currents (I(Ca)) is inhibited by 1-butanol, with little or no block by secondary or tert-butanol. Detailed comparison shows for the first time that the different butanol isomers exert distinct, and sometimes opposing, effects on the voltage-dependence and gating kinetics of I(Ca). We discuss these data with regard to PLD signaling in cellular physiology and the molecular targets of general anesthetics."
https://openalex.org/W2003426160,"Meiosis is a specialised cell division that involves chromosome replication, two rounds of chromosome segregation and results in the formation of the gametes. Meiotic DNA replication generally precedes chromosome pairing, recombination and synapsis in sexually developing eukaryotes. In this work, replication has been studied during premeiosis and early meiosis in wheat using flow cytometry, which has allowed the quantification of the amount of DNA in wheat anther in each phase of the cell cycle during premeiosis and each stage of early meiosis. Flow cytometry has been revealed as a suitable and user-friendly tool to detect and quantify DNA replication during early meiosis in wheat. Chromosome replication was detected in wheat during premeiosis and early meiosis until the stage of pachytene, when chromosomes are associated in pairs to further recombine and correctly segregate in the gametes. In addition, the effect of the Ph1 locus, which controls chromosome pairing and affects replication in wheat, was also studied by flow cytometry. Here we showed that the Ph1 locus plays an important role on the length of meiotic DNA replication in wheat, particularly affecting the rate of replication during early meiosis in wheat."
https://openalex.org/W2050492338,"In humans, more difficult decisions result in behavioural and physiological changes suggestive of increased arousal, but little is known about the effect of decision difficulty in other species. A difficult decision can have a number of characteristics; we aimed to monitor how finely balanced decisions, compared to unbalanced ones, affected the behaviour and physiology of chickens. An unbalanced decision was one in which the two options were of unequal net value (1 (Q1) vs. 6 (Q6) pieces of sweetcorn with no cost associated with either option); a finely balanced decision was one in which the options were of equal net value (i.e. hens were ""indifferent"" to both options). To identify hens' indifference, a titration procedure was used in which a cost (electromagnetic weight on an access door) was applied to the Q6 option, to find the individual point at which hens chose this option approximately equally to Q1 via a non-weighted door. We then compared behavioural and physiological indicators of arousal (head movements, latency to choose, heart-rate variability and surface body temperature) when chickens made decisions that were unbalanced or finely balanced. Significant physiological (heart-rate variability) and behavioural (latency to pen) differences were found between the finely balanced and balanced conditions, but these were likely to be artefacts of the greater time and effort required to push through the weighted doors. No other behavioural and physiological measures were significantly different between the decision categories. We suggest that more information is needed on when best to monitor likely changes in arousal during decision-making and that future studies should consider decisions defined as difficult in other ways."
https://openalex.org/W2066658177,"Background Ketosis-prone diabetes (KPDM) is new-onset diabetic ketoacidosis without precipitating factors in non-type 1 diabetic patients; after management, some are withdrawn from exogenous insulin, although determining factors remain unclear. Methods Twenty KPDM patients and twelve type 1 diabetic patients (T1DM), evaluated at baseline, 12 and 24 months with/without insulin maintenance underwent a standardized mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) for 2 h. Results At baseline, triglyceride and C3 were higher during MMTT in KPDM vs. T1DM (p<0.0001) with no differences in non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) while Acylation Stimulating Protein (ASP) tended to be higher. Within 12 months, 11 KPDM were withdrawn from insulin treatment (KPDM-ins), while 9 were maintained (KPDM+ins). NEFA was lower in KPDM-ins vs. KPDM+ins at baseline (p = 0.0006), 12 months (p<0.0001) and 24 months (p<0.0001) during MMTT. NEFA in KPDM-ins decreased over 30–120 minutes (p<0.05), but not in KPDM+ins. Overall, C3 was higher in KPDM-ins vs KPDM+ins at 12 months (p = 0.0081) and 24 months (p = 0.0019), while ASP was lower at baseline (p = 0.0024) and 12 months (p = 0.0281), with a decrease in ASP/C3 ratio. Conclusions Notwithstanding greater adiposity in KPDM-ins, greater NEFA decreases and lower ASP levels during MMTT suggest better insulin and ASP sensitivity in these patients."

https://openalex.org/W2014607709,"The complex multi-gear, multi-species tropical fisheries in developing countries are poorly understood and characterising the landings from these fisheries is often impossible using conventional approaches. A rapid assessment method for characterising landings at fish markets, using an index of abundance and estimated weight within taxonomic groups, is described. This approach was developed for contexts where there are no detailed data collection protocols, and where consistent data collection across a wide range of fisheries types and geographic areas is required, regardless of the size of the site and scale of the landings. This methodology, which was demonstrated at seven fish landing sites/fish markets in southern Indonesia between July 2008 and January 2011, provides a rapid assessment of the abundance and diversity in the wild catch over a wide variety of taxonomic groups. The approach has wider application for species-rich fisheries in developing countries where there is an urgent need for better data collection protocols, monitoring future changes in market demographics, and evaluating health of fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W1995958918,"Purpose To investigate the impact of clinical target volume (CTV) shape and size on CTV to planning target volume (PTV) margin expansion. Methods and Materials Using numerical integration methods, margins accounting for random errors and systematic errors were calculated for CTVs of different shapes and sizes. We use and to represent the coefficients, for random errors and systematic errors, respectively, that ensure that every point of the CTV receives ≥95% of the prescribed dose. Results The part of the margin accounting for random errors depends on CTV shape and size; generally, a convex part of a CTV would have a larger margin than a concave part. However, the part of the margin accounting for systematic errors is independent of CTV shape and size. Conclusions CTV shape and size should be considered when generating a PTV. For a complex CTV, the margins of the various parts of the CTV are different and related to local forms."
