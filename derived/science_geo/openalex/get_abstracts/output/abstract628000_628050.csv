https://openalex.org/W2912990441,"Signal peptides (SPs) are short amino acid sequences in the amino terminus of many newly synthesized proteins that target proteins into, or across, membranes. Bioinformatic tools can predict SPs from amino acid sequences, but most cannot distinguish between various types of signal peptides. We present a deep neural network-based approach that improves SP prediction across all domains of life and distinguishes between three types of prokaryotic SPs. SignalP 5.0 improves proteome-wide detection of signal peptides across all organisms and can distinguish between different types of signal peptides in prokaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2913914265,"Microbiome-wide association studies on large population cohorts have highlighted associations between the gut microbiome and complex traits, including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity1. However, the causal relationships remain largely unresolved. We leveraged information from 952 normoglycemic individuals for whom genome-wide genotyping, gut metagenomic sequence and fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels were available2, then combined this information with genome-wide-association summary statistics for 17 metabolic and anthropometric traits. Using bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to assess causality3, we found that the host-genetic-driven increase in gut production of the SCFA butyrate was associated with improved insulin response after an oral glucose-tolerance test (P = 9.8 × 10−5), whereas abnormalities in the production or absorption of another SCFA, propionate, were causally related to an increased risk of T2D (P = 0.004). These data provide evidence of a causal effect of the gut microbiome on metabolic traits and support the use of MR as a means to elucidate causal relationships from microbiome-wide association findings. Mendelian randomization analyses using genotyping data, gut metagenomic sequence and fecal short-chain-fatty-acid levels from 952 individuals combined with GWAS data show evidence of a causal effect of the gut microbiome on metabolic traits."
https://openalex.org/W2911604931,"Autologous induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) constitute an unlimited cell source for patient-specific cell-based organ repair strategies. However, their generation and subsequent differentiation into specific cells or tissues entail cell line-specific manufacturing challenges and form a lengthy process that precludes acute treatment modalities. These shortcomings could be overcome by using prefabricated allogeneic cell or tissue products, but the vigorous immune response against histo-incompatible cells has prevented the successful implementation of this approach. Here we show that both mouse and human iPSCs lose their immunogenicity when major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II genes are inactivated and CD47 is over-expressed. These hypoimmunogenic iPSCs retain their pluripotent stem cell potential and differentiation capacity. Endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and cardiomyocytes derived from hypoimmunogenic mouse or human iPSCs reliably evade immune rejection in fully MHC-mismatched allogeneic recipients and survive long-term without the use of immunosuppression. These findings suggest that hypoimmunogenic cell grafts can be engineered for universal transplantation. Genetic engineering prevents immune rejection of allogeneic cell transplants derived from iPSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2914658811,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a monogenic disorder and a candidate for therapeutic genome editing. There have been several recent reports of genome editing in preclinical models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy1-6, however, the long-term persistence and safety of these genome editing approaches have not been addressed. Here we show that genome editing and dystrophin protein restoration is sustained in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy for 1 year after a single intravenous administration of an adeno-associated virus that encodes CRISPR (AAV-CRISPR). We also show that AAV-CRISPR is immunogenic when administered to adult mice7; however, humoral and cellular immune responses can be avoided by treating neonatal mice. Additionally, we describe unintended genome and transcript alterations induced by AAV-CRISPR that should be considered for the development of AAV-CRISPR as a therapeutic approach. This study shows the potential of AAV-CRISPR for permanent genome corrections and highlights aspects of host response and alternative genome editing outcomes that require further study."
https://openalex.org/W2912937988,"Reproducibility in research can be compromised by both biological and technical variation, but most of the focus is on removing the latter. Here we investigate the effects of biological variation in HeLa cell lines using a systems-wide approach. We determine the degree of molecular and phenotypic variability across 14 stock HeLa samples from 13 international laboratories. We cultured cells in uniform conditions and profiled genome-wide copy numbers, mRNAs, proteins and protein turnover rates in each cell line. We discovered substantial heterogeneity between HeLa variants, especially between lines of the CCL2 and Kyoto varieties, and observed progressive divergence within a specific cell line over 50 successive passages. Genomic variability has a complex, nonlinear effect on transcriptome, proteome and protein turnover profiles, and proteotype patterns explain the varying phenotypic response of different cell lines to Salmonella infection. These findings have implications for the interpretation and reproducibility of research results obtained from human cultured cells. Systems-wide analysis of HeLa cell lines from 13 labs identifies substantial molecular and phenotypic variability."
https://openalex.org/W2914025980,"Cellular senescence is a stable growth arrest that is implicated in tissue ageing and cancer. Senescent cells are characterized by an upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, which is termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). NAD+ metabolism influences both tissue ageing and cancer. However, the role of NAD+ metabolism in regulating the SASP is poorly understood. Here, we show that nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting enzyme of the NAD+ salvage pathway, governs the proinflammatory SASP independent of senescence-associated growth arrest. NAMPT expression is regulated by high mobility group A (HMGA) proteins during senescence. The HMGA-NAMPT-NAD+ signalling axis promotes the proinflammatory SASP by enhancing glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. HMGA proteins and NAMPT promote the proinflammatory SASP through NAD+-mediated suppression of AMPK kinase, which suppresses the p53-mediated inhibition of p38 MAPK to enhance NF-κB activity. We conclude that NAD+ metabolism governs the proinflammatory SASP. Given the tumour-promoting effects of the proinflammatory SASP, our results suggest that anti-ageing dietary NAD+ augmentation should be administered with precision."

https://openalex.org/W3105060245,"Topological phases enable protected transport along the edges of materials, offering immunity against scattering from disorder and imperfections. These phases have been demonstrated for electronic systems, electromagnetic waves1-5, cold atoms6,7, acoustics8 and even mechanics9, and their potential applications include spintronics, quantum computing and highly efficient lasers10-12. Typically, the model describing topological insulators is a spatial lattice in two or three dimensions. However, topological edge states have also been observed in a lattice with one spatial dimension and one synthetic dimension (corresponding to the spin modes of an ultracold atom13-15), and atomic modes have been used as synthetic dimensions to demonstrate lattice models and physical phenomena that are not accessible to experiments in spatial lattices13,16,17. In photonics, topological lattices with synthetic dimensions have been proposed for the study of physical phenomena in high dimensions and interacting photons18-22, but so far photonic topological insulators in synthetic dimensions have not been observed. Here we demonstrate experimentally a photonic topological insulator in synthetic dimensions. We fabricate a photonic lattice in which photons are subjected to an effective magnetic field in a space with one spatial dimension and one synthetic modal dimension. Our scheme supports topological edge states in this spatial-modal lattice, resulting in a robust topological state that extends over the bulk of a two-dimensional real-space lattice. Our system can be used to increase the dimensionality of a photonic lattice and induce long-range coupling by design, leading to lattice models that can be used to study unexplored physical phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W2911835695,"The genomes of multicellular organisms are extensively folded into 3D chromosome territories within the nucleus1. Advanced 3D genome-mapping methods that combine proximity ligation and high-throughput sequencing (such as chromosome conformation capture, Hi-C)2, and chromatin immunoprecipitation techniques (such as chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing, ChIA-PET)3, have revealed topologically associating domains4 with frequent chromatin contacts, and have identified chromatin loops mediated by specific protein factors for insulation and regulation of transcription5–7. However, these methods rely on pairwise proximity ligation and reflect population-level views, and thus cannot reveal the detailed nature of chromatin interactions. Although single-cell Hi-C8 potentially overcomes this issue, this method may be limited by the sparsity of data that is inherent to current single-cell assays. Recent advances in microfluidics have opened opportunities for droplet-based genomic analysis9 but this approach has not yet been adapted for chromatin interaction analysis. Here we describe a strategy for multiplex chromatin-interaction analysis via droplet-based and barcode-linked sequencing, which we name ChIA-Drop. We demonstrate the robustness of ChIA-Drop in capturing complex chromatin interactions with single-molecule precision, which has not been possible using methods based on population-level pairwise contacts. By applying ChIA-Drop to Drosophila cells, we show that chromatin topological structures predominantly consist of multiplex chromatin interactions with high heterogeneity; ChIA-Drop also reveals promoter-centred multivalent interactions, which provide topological insights into transcription. A strategy using droplet-based and barcode-linked sequencing captures multiplex chromatin interactions at single-molecule precision, and here provides topological insight into chromatin structures and transcription in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2912048746,"Small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) are core spliceosome components and mediate pre-mRNA splicing. Here we show that snRNAs contain a regulated and reversible nucleotide modification causing them to exist as two different methyl isoforms, m1 and m2, reflecting the methylation state of the adenosine adjacent to the snRNA cap. We find that snRNA biogenesis involves the formation of an initial m1 isoform with a single-methylated adenosine (2′-O-methyladenosine, Am), which is then converted to a dimethylated m2 isoform (N6,2′-O-dimethyladenosine, m6Am). The relative m1 and m2 isoform levels are determined by the RNA demethylase FTO, which selectively demethylates the m2 isoform. We show FTO is inhibited by the oncometabolite d-2-hydroxyglutarate, resulting in increased m2-snRNA levels. Furthermore, cells that exhibit high m2-snRNA levels show altered patterns of alternative splicing. Together, these data reveal that FTO controls a previously unknown central step of snRNA processing involving reversible methylation, and suggest that epitranscriptomic information in snRNA may influence mRNA splicing. Two different methylation states of the adenosine adjacent to the snRNA cap are found in the biogenesis process of snRNAs, Am and m6Am, whose levels are regulated by FTO and are related to alternative pre-mRNA splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2913719405,"Covalent modification of LC3 and GABARAP proteins to phosphatidylethanolamine in the double-membrane phagophore is a key event in the early phase of macroautophagy, but can also occur on single-membrane structures. In both cases this involves transfer of LC3/GABARAP from ATG3 to phosphatidylethanolamine at the target membrane. Here we have purified the full-length human ATG12-5-ATG16L1 complex and show its essential role in LC3B/GABARAP lipidation in vitro. We have identified two functionally distinct membrane-binding regions in ATG16L1. An N-terminal membrane-binding amphipathic helix is required for LC3B lipidation under all conditions tested. By contrast, the C-terminal membrane-binding region is dispensable for canonical autophagy but essential for VPS34-independent LC3B lipidation at perturbed endosomes. We further show that the ATG16L1 C-terminus can compensate for WIPI2 depletion to sustain lipidation during starvation. This C-terminal membrane-binding region is present only in the β-isoform of ATG16L1, showing that ATG16L1 isoforms mechanistically distinguish between different LC3B lipidation mechanisms under different cellular conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2913758618,"CRISPR/Cas9-based therapies hold considerable promise for the treatment of genetic diseases. Among these, Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, caused by a point mutation in the LMNA gene, stands out as a potential candidate. Here, we explore the efficacy of a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach that reverts several alterations in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome cells and mice by introducing frameshift mutations in the LMNA gene."
https://openalex.org/W2914390513,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare lethal genetic disorder characterized by symptoms reminiscent of accelerated aging. The major underlying genetic cause is a substitution mutation in the gene coding for lamin A, causing the production of a toxic isoform called progerin. Here we show that reduction of lamin A/progerin by a single-dose systemic administration of adeno-associated virus-delivered CRISPR-Cas9 components suppresses HGPS in a mouse model."
https://openalex.org/W2913217538,"The root cap surrounding the tip of plant roots is thought to protect the delicate stem cells in the root meristem. We discovered that the first layer of root cap cells is covered by an electron-opaque cell wall modification resembling a plant cuticle. Cuticles are polyester-based protective structures considered exclusive to aerial plant organs. Mutations in cutin biosynthesis genes affect the composition and ultrastructure of this cuticular structure, confirming its cutin-like characteristics. Strikingly, targeted degradation of the root cap cuticle causes a hypersensitivity to abiotic stresses during seedling establishment. Furthermore, lateral root primordia also display a cuticle that, when defective, causes delayed outgrowth and organ deformations, suggesting that it facilitates lateral root emergence. Our results show that the previously unrecognized root cap cuticle protects the root meristem during the critical phase of seedling establishment and promotes the efficient formation of lateral roots."
https://openalex.org/W2911391764,"The contribution of lineage identity and differentiation state to malignant transformation is controversial. We have previously shown that adult neural stem and early progenitor cells give origin to glioblastoma. Here we systematically assessed the tumor-initiating potential of adult neural populations at various stages of lineage progression. Cell type-specific tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase transgenes were used to target glioblastoma-relevant tumor suppressors Nf1, Trp53 and Pten in late-stage neuronal progenitors, neuroblasts and differentiated neurons. Mutant mice showed cellular and molecular defects demonstrating the impact of tumor suppressor loss, with mutant neurons being the most resistant to early changes associated with tumor development. However, we observed no evidence of glioma formation. These studies show that increasing lineage restriction is accompanied by decreasing susceptibility to malignant transformation, indicating a glioblastoma cell-of-origin hierarchy in which stem cells sit at the apex and differentiated cell types are least susceptible to tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2912915410,"Retrieving and acting on memories of food-predicting environments are fundamental processes for animal survival. Hippocampal pyramidal cells (PYRs) of the mammalian brain provide mnemonic representations of space. Yet the substrates by which these hippocampal representations support memory-guided behavior remain unknown. Here, we uncover a direct connection from dorsal CA1 (dCA1) hippocampus to nucleus accumbens (NAc) that enables the behavioral manifestation of place-reward memories. By monitoring neuronal ensembles in mouse dCA1→NAc pathway, combined with cell-type selective optogenetic manipulations of input-defined postsynaptic neurons, we show that dCA1 PYRs drive NAc medium spiny neurons and orchestrate their spiking activity using feedforward inhibition mediated by dCA1-connected parvalbumin-expressing fast-spiking interneurons. This tripartite cross-circuit motif supports spatial appetitive memory and associated NAc assemblies, being independent of dorsal subiculum and dispensable for both spatial novelty detection and reward seeking. Our findings demonstrate that the dCA1→NAc pathway instantiates a limbic-motor interface for neuronal representations of space to promote effective appetitive behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2914390597,"Over their lifetime, long-term haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are exposed to a variety of stress conditions that they must endure. Many stresses, such as infection/inflammation, reactive oxygen species, nutritional deprivation and hypoxia, activate unfolded protein response signalling, which induces either adaptive changes to resolve the stress or apoptosis to clear the damaged cell. Whether unfolded-protein-response signalling plays any role in HSC regulation remains to be established. Here, we report that the adaptive signalling of the unfolded protein response, IRE1α-XBP1, protects HSCs from endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis. IRE1α knockout leads to reduced reconstitution of HSCs. Furthermore, we show that oncogenic N-RasG12D activates IRE1α-XBP1, through MEK-GSK3β, to promote HSC survival under endoplasmic reticulum stress. Inhibiting IRE1α-XBP1 abolished N-RasG12D-mediated survival under endoplasmic reticulum stress and diminished the competitive advantage of NrasG12D HSCs in transplant recipients. Our studies illuminate how the adaptive endoplasmic reticulum stress response is advantageous in sustaining self-renewal of HSCs and promoting pre-leukaemic clonal dominance."
https://openalex.org/W2913403432,"Streptococcus pyogenes causes 700 million human infections annually worldwide, yet, despite a century of intensive effort, there is no licensed vaccine against this bacterium. Although a number of large-scale genomic studies of bacterial pathogens have been published, the relationships among the genome, transcriptome, and virulence in large bacterial populations remain poorly understood. We sequenced the genomes of 2,101 emm28 S. pyogenes invasive strains, from which we selected 492 phylogenetically diverse strains for transcriptome analysis and 50 strains for virulence assessment. Data integration provided a novel understanding of the virulence mechanisms of this model organism. Genome-wide association study, expression quantitative trait loci analysis, machine learning, and isogenic mutant strains identified and confirmed a one-nucleotide indel in an intergenic region that significantly alters global transcript profiles and ultimately virulence. The integrative strategy that we used is generally applicable to any microbe and may lead to new therapeutics for many human pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2915235506,"DNA modification is known to regulate experience-dependent gene expression. However, beyond cytosine methylation and its oxidated derivatives, very little is known about the functional importance of chemical modifications on other nucleobases in the brain. Here we report that in adult mice trained in fear extinction, the DNA modification N6-methyl-2'-deoxyadenosine (m6dA) accumulates along promoters and coding sequences in activated prefrontal cortical neurons. The deposition of m6dA is associated with increased genome-wide occupancy of the mammalian m6dA methyltransferase, N6amt1, and this correlates with extinction-induced gene expression. The accumulation of m6dA is associated with transcriptional activation at the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) P4 promoter, which is required for Bdnf exon IV messenger RNA expression and for the extinction of conditioned fear. These results expand the scope of DNA modifications in the adult brain and highlight changes in m6dA as an epigenetic mechanism associated with activity-induced gene expression and the formation of fear extinction memory."
https://openalex.org/W2914063843,"Cellular stress or injury induces release of endogenous danger signals such as ATP, which plays a central role in activating immune cells. ATP is essential for the release of nonclassically secreted cytokines such as IL-1β but, paradoxically, has been reported to inhibit the release of classically secreted cytokines such as TNF. Here, we reveal that ATP does switch off soluble TNF (17 kDa) release from LPS-treated macrophages, but rather than inhibiting the entire TNF secretion, ATP packages membrane TNF (26 kDa) within microvesicles (MVs). Secretion of membrane TNF within MVs bypasses the conventional endoplasmic reticulum- and Golgi transport-dependent pathway and is mediated by acid sphingomyelinase. These membrane TNF-carrying MVs are biologically more potent than soluble TNF in vivo, producing significant lung inflammation in mice. Thus, ATP critically alters TNF trafficking and secretion from macrophages, inducing novel unconventional membrane TNF signaling via MVs without direct cell-to-cell contact. These data have crucial implications for this key cytokine, particularly when therapeutically targeting TNF in acute inflammatory diseases.-Soni, S., O'Dea, K. P., Tan, Y. Y., Cho, K., Abe, E., Romano, R., Cui, J., Ma, D., Sarathchandra, P., Wilson, M. R., Takata, M. ATP redirects cytokine trafficking and promotes novel membrane TNF signaling via microvesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2915260273,"Objectives The objective of this study was to build and assess the performance of survival prediction models using the gender-specific informative risk factors for patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Methods A lasso approach was used to decide the informative predictors for building semi-parametric proportional hazards Cox model. Separate models were built for all patients [N = 299], male patients [Nmale = 194 (64.88%)], and female patients [Nfemale = 105 (35.12%)], to observe the risk factors associated with the individual’s risk of death. The likelihood- ratio test was used to test the goodness of fit of the selected model, and the C-index was used to assess the predictive performance of the selected model(s) with respect to the overall model with all observed risk factors. Results The survival prediction model for females is notably different from that for males. For males, smoking, diabetes, and anaemia, whereas for females, ejection fraction, sodium, and platelets count are non-informative with zero regression coefficients. The goodness of fit of the selected models with respect to the general model with all observed risk factors is tested using the likelihood-ratio test. The results are in favor of the selected models with p-values 0.51,0.61, and 0.70 for all patients, male patients, and female patients, respectively. The same values of C-index for the full model and the selected models for overall data, for males, and for females (0.72, 0.73, and 0.77 for overall data, male data, and female data, respectively) indicate that the selected models are as good as the corresponding overall models regarding their predictive performance. Conclusion There is a substantial difference in the survival prediction models for heart failure (HF) of male and female patients in this study. More studies are needed in Pakistan for confirming this striking male-female difference regarding the potential risk factors to predict survival with heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2911549248,"Central ischemic necrosis is one of the biggest obstacles in the clinical application of traditional tissue-engineered bone (TEB) in critical-sized bone defect regeneration. Because of its ability to promote vascular invasion, endochondral ossification-based TEB has been applied for bone defect regeneration. However, inadequate chondrocyte hypertrophy can hinder vascular invasion and matrix mineralization during endochondral ossification. In light of recent studies suggesting that ceria nanoparticles (CNPs) improve the blood vessel distribution within TEB, we modified TEB scaffold surfaces with CNPs and investigated the effect and mechanism of CNPs on endochondral ossification-based bone regeneration. The CNPs used in this study were synthesized by the microemulsion method and modified with alendronate-anchored polyethylene glycol 600. We showed that CNPs accelerated new bone formation and enhanced endochondral ossification-based bone regeneration in both a subcutaneous ectopic osteogenesis model and a mouse model of critical-sized bone defects. Mechanistically, CNPs significantly promoted endochondral ossification-based bone regeneration by ensuring sufficient hypertrophic differentiation via the activation of the RNA helicase, DEAH (Asp-Glu-Ala-His) box helicase 15, and its downstream target, p38 MAPK. These results suggested that CNPs could be applied as a biomaterial to improve the efficacy of endochondral ossification-based bone regeneration in critical-sized bone defects.-Li, J., Kang, F., Gong, X., Bai, Y., Dai, J., Zhao, C., Dou, C., Cao, Z., Liang, M., Dong, R., Jiang, H., Yang, X., Dong, S.

https://openalex.org/W2914545056,"Spastin is a microtubule-severing AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) protein needed for cell division and intracellular vesicle transport. Currently, we lack chemical inhibitors to probe spastin function in such dynamic cellular processes. To design a chemical inhibitor of spastin, we tested selected heterocyclic scaffolds against wild-type protein and constructs with engineered mutations in the nucleotide-binding site that do not substantially disrupt ATPase activity. These data, along with computational docking, guided improvements in compound potency and selectivity and led to spastazoline, a pyrazolyl-pyrrolopyrimidine-based cell-permeable probe for spastin. These studies also identified spastazoline-resistance-conferring point mutations in spastin. Spastazoline, along with the matched inhibitor-sensitive and inhibitor-resistant cell lines we generated, were used in parallel experiments to dissect spastin-specific phenotypes in dividing cells. Together, our findings suggest how chemical probes for AAA proteins, along with inhibitor resistance-conferring mutations, can be designed and used to dissect dynamic cellular processes. The AAA protein spastin is needed for cell division and organelle transport. Testing spastin constructs with engineered mutations resulted in the identification of a chemical probe to analyze spastin-specific functions in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2916915766,"Genomic prediction is a useful tool for plant and animal breeding programs and is starting to be used to predict human diseases as well. A shortcoming that slows down the genomic selection deployment is that the accuracy of the prediction is not known a priori. We propose EthAcc (Estimated THeoretical ACCuracy) as a method for estimating the accuracy given a training set that is genotyped and phenotyped. EthAcc is based on a causal quantitative trait loci model estimated by a genome-wide association study. This estimated causal model is crucial; therefore, we compared different methods to find the one yielding the best EthAcc. The multilocus mixed model was found to perform the best. We compared EthAcc to accuracy estimators that can be derived via a mixed marker model. We showed that EthAcc is the only approach to correctly estimate the accuracy. Moreover, in case of a structured population, in accordance with the achieved accuracy, EthAcc showed that the biggest training set is not always better than a smaller and closer training set. We then performed training set optimization with EthAcc and compared it to CDmean. EthAcc outperformed CDmean on real datasets from sugar beet, maize, and wheat. Nonetheless, its performance was mainly due to the use of an optimal but inaccessible set as a start of the optimization algorithm. EthAcc’s precision and algorithm issues prevent it from reaching a good training set with a random start. Despite this drawback, we demonstrated that a substantial gain in accuracy can be obtained by performing training set optimization."
https://openalex.org/W2915439331,"Psoriasis and its associated inflammatory arthritis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), have a clear heritable component, but a large proportion of the heritable risk remains unexplained by gene sequence variation. This study aimed to determine if epigenetic factors contribute to the missing heritability in psoriatic disease. DNA methylation profiling was performed on sperm cells from 23 probands with psoriasis without PsA (PsC), 13 PsA probands, and 18 unaffected controls. Differentially methylated CpGs and regions (DMRs) were identified and validated by pyrosequencing. Underlying AluY and copy number variation (CNV) in the HCG26 and IL22 genes, respectively, were assessed by genotyping. Array, subject’s age, age of psoriasis onset, psoriasis severity, and medication usage were found to influence methylation at many genes and were included as covariates in the analysis. Between PsC probands vs. controls, 169 DMRs were found; 754 DMRs were found between PsA probands vs. controls, and 86 between PsA and PsC probands (adjusted p<0.05). Differences in methylation across DMRs were generally subtle (<10%) but correlated well with pyrosequencing. Biological inference prioritized notable DMRs associated with skin disease (SIGLEC14, JAM3, PCOLCE, RXRB), skin and/or joint disease (MBP, OSBPL5, SNORD115, HCG26), and joint disease (IL22, ELF5, PPP2R2D, PTPRN2, HCG26). Hypermethylation of the DMR within the first exon of arthritis-associated IL22 showed significant correlation (rho = 0.34, 95% CI 0.06–0.57, p = 0.01) between paired sperm and blood samples, independent of a CNV within the same region. Further studies are needed to rule out underlying genetic causes and determine if these represent heritable, constitutional epimutations, or are the result of exposure of germ cells to endogenous or exogenous environmental factors."
https://openalex.org/W2952620741,"Most crop simulation models require the use of Genotype Specific Parameters (GSPs) which provide the Genotype component of G×E×M interactions. Estimation of GSPs is the most difficult aspect of most modelling exercises because it requires expensive and time-consuming field experiments. GSPs could also be estimated using multi-year and multi locational data from breeder evaluation experiments. This research was set up with the following objectives: i) to determine GSPs of 10 newly released maize varieties for the Nigerian Savannas using data from both calibration experiments and by using existing data from breeder varietal evaluation trials; ii) to compare the accuracy of the GSPs generated using experimental and breeder data; and iii) to evaluate CERES-Maize model to simulate grain and tissue nitrogen contents. For experimental evaluation, 8 different experiments were conducted during the rainy and dry seasons of 2016 across the Nigerian Savanna. Breeder evaluation data were also collected for 2 years and 7 locations. The calibrated GSPs were evaluated using data from a 4-year experiment conducted under varying nitrogen rates (0, 60 and 120kg N ha-1). For the model calibration using experimental data, calculated model efficiency (EF) values ranged between 0.88–0.94 and coefficient of determination (d-index) between 0.93–0.98. Calibration of time-series data produced nRMSE below 7% while all prediction deviations were below 10% of the mean. For breeder experiments, EF (0.58–0.88) and d-index (0.56–0.86) ranges were lower. Prediction deviations were below 17% of the means for all measured variables. Model evaluation using both experimental and breeder trials resulted in good agreement (low RMSE, high EF and d-index values) between observed and simulated grain yields, and tissue and grain nitrogen contents. It is concluded that higher calibration accuracy of CERES-Maize model is achieved from detailed experiments. If unavailable, data from breeder experimental trials collected from many locations and planting dates can be used with lower but acceptable accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2917882525,"When divided by a given mutation rate, the ρ (rho) statistic provides a simple estimator of the age of a clade within a phylogenetic tree by averaging the number of mutations from each sample in the clade to its root. However, a long-standing critique of the use of ρ in genetic dating has been quite often cited. Here we show that the critique is unfounded. We demonstrate by a formal mathematical argument and illustrate with a simulation study that ρ estimates are unbiased and also that ρ and maximum likelihood estimates do not differ in any systematic fashion. We also demonstrate that the claim that the associated confidence intervals commonly estimate the uncertainty inappropriately is flawed since it relies on a means of calculating standard errors that is not used by any other researchers, whereas an established expression for the standard error is largely unproblematic. We conclude that ρ dating, alongside approaches such as maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference, remains a useful tool for genetic dating."
https://openalex.org/W2912994870,"Krüppel-like factor (KLF) 15 has emerged as a critical regulator of fibrosis in cardiovascular diseases. However, the precise role that KLF15 and its functional domain played in adventitial inflammation and fibrosis remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the role of the transactivation domain (TAD) of KLF15 in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced adventitial pathologic changes. KLF15 expression was decreased in the vascular adventitia of Ang II-infused mice (1000 ng/kg/min, 14 d) and in adventitial fibroblasts (AFs) stimulated by Ang II (10-7 M). Adenovirus-mediated KLF15 overexpression normalized Ang II-induced vascular hypertrophy, increased collagen deposition, macrophage infiltration, and CCL2 and VCAM-1 expression. Interestingly, KLF15-ΔTAD (KLF15 with deletion of TAD at amino acids 132-152) overexpression showed no effect on the above pathologic changes. Similarly, perivascularly overexpression of KLF15 but not KLF15-ΔTAD in carotid arteries also attenuated Ang II-induced vascular inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, KLF15 overexpression after Ang II infusion rescued Ang II-induced vascular remodeling. CCL2 or VCAM-1-mediated monocyte and macrophage migration or adhesion to AFs in response to Ang II was negatively regulated by KLF15 through TAD. Ang II-enhanced Smad2/3 activation and adventitial migration, proliferation, and differentiation of AFs were suppressed by KLF15 but not KLF15-ΔTAD overexpression. Conversely, small interfering RNA knockdown of KLF15 aggravated Ang II-induced Smad2/3 activation and dysfunction of AFs. Luciferase, coimmunoprecipitation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay were used to demonstrate that interaction of KLF15 with Smad2/3 suppressed CCL2 expression through TAD. Mechanistically, activation of Ang II type 1 receptor/phospholipase Cγ 1/ERK1/2 signaling resulted in a decrease of KLF15 expression. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that KLF15 negatively regulates activation of AFs through TAD, which plays an important role in Ang II-induced adventitial inflammation and fibrosis.-Lu, Y.-Y., Li, X.-D., Zhou, H.-D., Shao, S., He, S., Hong, M.-N., Liu, J.-C., Xu, Y.-L., Wu, Y.-J., Zhu, D.-L., Wang, J.-G., Gao, P.-J.

https://openalex.org/W2917210205,"Immune-regulation and homeostasis are critical in cancer therapy and immunomodulatory biomaterials have been used to decrease side effects of immunosuppressant drugs. Anionic macromolecules (CFAMs) were isolated from the seaweed Codium fragile, and its immune-enhancing biological activities were examined in CY-induced immunosuppressed mice. CFAMs improved the splenic lymphocyte proliferation, NK cell activity, and spleen index. The expression of immune-associated genes was highly upregulated in splenic lymphocytes, and gene expression was differently regulated according to mitogens such as T-cell (Con A) and B-cell (LPS) mitogens. Additionally, CFAMs boosted the proliferation, NO production, and phagocytosis of peritoneal macrophages. CFAMs also considerably stimulated immune-associated gene expression in peritoneal macrophages. Moreover, our results showed CFAMs mediated its immune-enhancing effects via the MAPK pathway. These suggested CFAMs can be used as a potent immunomodulatory material under immune-suppressive condition. Furthermore, CFAMs may also be used as a bio-functional and pharmaceutical material for improving human health and immunity."

Illumina cDNA libraries were produced from RNAs isolated from the roots of sunflower plants at 4 and 16 days after inoculation with the AM fungus Rhizoglomus irregulare and from their respective control plants. Illumina reads were mapped to a library of reverse transcriptase-encoding sequences, putatively belonging to long terminal repeat retrotransposons of Gypsy and Copia superfamilies. Forty-six different reverse transcriptase sequences were transcribed, although at a low rate, in mycorrhizal or control roots and only four were significantly over-expressed at day 16, compared with control roots. Almost all expressed or over-expressed sequences belonged to low-copy elements, mostly, of the Copia superfamily. A meta-analysis, using publicly available Illumina cDNA libraries obtained from sunflower plants treated with different hormones and chemicals, mimicking stimuli produced by abiotic and biotic stresses, was also conducted. Such analyses indicated that the four reverse transcriptase sequences over-expressed in mycorrhizal roots were explicitly induced only by AM symbiosis, showing the specificity of AM stimuli compared to that of other fungal/plant interactions."

However, no study of successfully applied genome editing has been reported in a dinoflagellate despite the first genetic transformation of Symbiodinium being published about 20 years ago. Using an array of different available transformation techniques, we attempted to transform Symbiodinium microadriaticum (CCMP2467), a dinoflagellate symbiont of reef-building corals, with the view to performing subsequent CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing. Plasmid vectors designed for nuclear transformation containing the chloramphenicol resistance gene under the control of the CaMV p35S promoter as well as several putative endogenous promoters were used to test a variety of transformation techniques including biolistics, electroporation and agitation with silicon carbide whiskers. Chloroplast-targeted transformation was attempted using an engineered Symbiodinium chloroplast minicircle encoding a modified PsbA protein expected to confer atrazine resistance. We report that we have been unable to confer chloramphenicol or atrazine resistance on Symbiodinium microadriaticum strain CCMP2467."
https://openalex.org/W2915049096,"Successful pregnancy requires normal placentation, which largely depends on the tight regulation of proliferation, invasion, and migration of trophoblast cells. Abnormal functioning of trophoblast cells may cause failure of uterine spiral artery remodeling, which may be related to pregnancy-related disorders, such as preeclampsia. Here, we reported that an actin-binding protein, α-actinin (ACTN)4, was dysregulated in placentas from early onset preeclampsia. Moreover, knockdown of ACTN4 markedly inhibited trophoblast cell proliferation by reducing AKT membrane translocation. Furthermore, E-cadherin regulated ACTN4 and β-catenin colocalization on trophoblast cell podosomes, and ACTN4 down-regulation suppressed the E-cadherin-induced cell invasion increase via depolymerizing actin filaments. Moreover, loss of ACTN4 recapitulated a number of the features of human preeclampsia. Therefore, our data indicate that ACNT4 plays a role in trophoblast function and is required for normal placental development.-Peng, W., Tong, C., Li, L., Huang, C., Ran, Y., Chen, X., Bai, Y., Liu, Y., Zhao, J., Tan, B., Luo, X., Wang, H., Wen, L., Zhang, C., Zhang, H., Ding, Y., Qi, H., Baker, P.

First, we sought to compare the in vitro susceptibility of liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) and anidulafungin on Candida albicans and Candida glabrata biofilms growing on silicone discs. Second, we sought to compare the activity of LAmB versus anidulafungin for the treatment of experimental catheter-related C. albicans and C. glabrata infections with the antifungal lock technique in a rabbit model.Two C. albicans and two C. glabrata clinical strains were used. The minimum biofilm eradication concentration for 90% eradication (MBEC90) values were determined after 48h of treatment with LAmB and anidulafungin. Confocal microscopy was used to visualize the morphology and viability of yeasts growing in biofilms. Central venous catheters were inserted into New Zealand rabbits, which were inoculated of each strain of C. albicans and C. glabrata. Then, catheters were treated for 48h with saline or with antifungal lock technique using either LAmB (5mg/mL) or anidulafungin (3.33mg/mL).In vitro: anidulafungin showed greater activity than LAmB against C. albicans and C. glabrata strains. For C. albicans: MBEC90 of anidulafungin versus LAmB: CA176, 0.03 vs. 128 mg/L; CA180, 0.5 vs. 64 mg/L. For C. glabrata: MBEC90 of anidulafungin versus LAmB: CG171, 0.5 vs. 64 mg/L; CG334, 2 vs. 32 mg/L. In vivo: for C. albicans species, LAmB and anidulafungin achieved significant reductions relative to growth control of log10 cfu recovered from the catheter tips (CA176: 3.6±0.3 log10 CFU, p≤0.0001; CA180: 3.8±0.1 log10 CFU, p≤0.01). For C. glabrata, anidulafungin lock therapy achieved significant reductions relative to the other treatments (CG171: 4.8 log10 CFU, p≤0.0001; CG334: 5.1 log10 CFU, p≤0.0001).For the C. albicans strains, both LAmB and anidulafungin may be promising antifungal lock technique for long-term catheter-related infections; however, anidulafungin showed significantly higher activity than LAmB against the C. glabrata strains."
https://openalex.org/W2916315837,"Cell differentiation is directed by extracellular cues and intrinsic epigenetic modifications, which control chromatin organization and transcriptional activation. Central to this process is PRC2, which modulates the di- and trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3; however, little is known concerning the direction of PRC2 to specific loci. Here, we have investigated the physical interactome of EZH2, the enzymatic core of PRC2, during retinoic acid-mediated differentiation of neuroepithelial, pluripotent NT2 cells and the dedifferentiation of neuroretinal epithelial ARPE19 cells in response to TGF-β. We identified Smad3 as an EZH2 interactor in both contexts. Co-occupation of the CDH1 promoter by Smad3 and EZH2 and the cooperative, functional nature of the interaction were established. We propose that the interaction between Smad3 and EZH2 targets the core polycomb assembly to defined regions of the genome to regulate transcriptional repression and forms a molecular switch that controls promoter access through epigenetic mechanisms leading to gene silencing.-Andrews, D., Oliviero, G., De Chiara, L., Watson, A., Rochford, E., Wynne, K., Kennedy, C., Clerkin, S., Doyle, B., Godson, C., Connell, P., O'Brien, C., Cagney, G., Crean, J.

https://openalex.org/W2917439076,"Low-frequency mowing has been proposed to be an effective strategy for the restoration and management of boreal fens after abandonment of traditional haymaking. This study investigates how mowing affects long-term vegetation change in both oceanic and continental boreal rich-fen vegetation. This will allow evaluation of the effectiveness of mowing as a management and restoration tool in this ecosystem in the face of climate change. At two nature reserves in Central Norway (Tågdalen, 63° 03’ N, 9° 05 E, oceanic climate and Sølendet, 62° 40’ N, 11° 50’ E, continental climate), we used permanent plot data from the two sites to compare plant species composition from the late 1960s to the early 1980s with that recorded in 2012–2015 in abandoned and mown fens. Changes in species composition and frequency were analysed by multivariate and univariate methods in relation to environmental variables and modelled climate and groundwater data. Mowing resulted in a decline in shrub and Molinia caerulea cover at the continental and oceanic sites respectively, and the total cover of specialist fen species had increased to a significantly greater extent in the mown plots than the unmown at the continental site. However, mowing did not have an effect on the cover of specialist bryophyte species, and some specialist species declined regardless of mowing treatment. Temperature sums had increased at both sites, but precipitation had not changed significantly. Mowing was shown to be the most important determinant of plant community composition at both sites, with local environmental conditions being of secondary importance. In conclusion, the abandonment of traditional management practices results in the loss of characteristic fen species. In order to encourage the restoration of typical rich-fen vegetation, particularly in oceanic areas, additional management measures, such as more intensive mowing, may be required."

We collected demographic and clinical information from attendees (aged 18–49). CT and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infection was determined by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) on self-collected urine specimens. Of 1,938 participants recruited, 10.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.6%-11.0%) tested positive for CT. Prevalence was similar between men (10.6% [85/804]; 95% CI, 9.5%–11.7%) and women (10.1% [115/1134]; 95% CI: 9.2%–11.0%). Being 18–25 years old (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.52; 95%CI:1.35–4.71), never tested for CT before (aOR = 2.42; 95%CI: 1.05–5.61) and infected with NG(aOR = 3.87; 95%CI: 2.10–7.10) were independently associated with CT infection.

The aptamers against the C4-HSL with a high affinity and specifity were successfully obtained and evaluated in real-time by this method. Results of biofilm inhibition experiments in vitro showed that the biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa was efficiently reduced to about 1/3 by the aptamers compared with that of the groups without the aptamers. Independent secondary structure simulation and computer-aided tertiary structure prediction (3dRNA) showed that the aptamers contained a highly conserved Y-shaped structural unit.

https://openalex.org/W2915558179,"Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) exhibits hepatotoxicity through signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) activation. On the contrary, interleukin-11 (IL-11) shows tissue-protective effects on various organs including the liver through STAT3 activation. Here, we found that IL-11 pretreatment protects hepatocytes from IFN-γ-induced death and investigated the molecular mechanisms, particularly focusing on signal crosstalk.Primary culture mouse hepatocytes were treated with IL-11 prior to IFN-γ, and cell death was evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase release into media. As a result, IL-11 pretreatment effectively suppressed IFN-γ-induced hepatocyte death. Since IFN-γ-induced hepatocyte death requires STAT1 signaling, the activity of STAT1 was analyzed. IFN-γ robustly activated STAT1 with its peak at 1 hr after stimulation, which was significantly attenuated by IL-11 pretreatment. Consistently, IL-11 pretreatment impeded mRNA increase of STAT1-downstream molecules promoting cell death, i.e., IRF-1, caspase 1, bak, and bax. IL-11-mediated suppression of STAT1 signaling was presumably due to upregulation of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) genes, which are well-known negative feedback regulators of the JAK/STAT pathway. Interestingly, however, IFN-γ pretreatment failed to affect the following IL-11-induced STAT3 activation, although IFN-γ also upregulated SOCSs. Finally, we demonstrated that IL-11 pretreatment mitigated oxidative stress through increasing expression of ROS scavengers.IL-11 protects hepatocytes from IFN-γ-induced death via STAT1 signal suppression and ROS scavenging. Further investigation into the mechanisms underlying selective negative feedback regulation of IFN-γ/STAT1 signaling compared to IL-11/STAT3 signaling may shed new light on the molecular biology of hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2917653876,"The Galveston Ship Channel (GSC) is a narrow, congested waterway that supports large-scale shipping, commercial fishing, dolphin tourism, and recreation. Human activity and common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) converge in the GSC with potentially negative consequences on the dolphins. Elevated land-based tracking and behavioral observation of dolphins and vessels were conducted along the GSC in June-August 2013 using a digital theodolite. Positional information was used to calculate dolphin movement patterns and proximity to vessels. Log-likelihood ratio and Chi-square contingency tests were used to assess behavioral states, and generalized additive models were used to analyze movement patterns (i.e., swimming speed, reorientation rate, and linearity) relative to endogenous and exogenous factors and vessel presence. Dolphins regularly use the GSC to forage (57% of observed behavioral states) and socialize (27%), and it is not a travel corridor for accessing other favorable sites (traveling = 5%). Dolphin behavior varied significantly based on time of day, group size, calf presence, and general boat presence. When boats were present, the proportion of time dolphins spent socializing and foraging was significantly less than expected by chance. Swimming speeds increased significantly in the presence of small recreational boats, dolphin-watching tour boats, shrimp trawlers, and when tour boats and shrimp trawlers were both present. Reorientation rate increased significantly in the presence of tour boats and trawlers. Dolphin behavioral responses to vessel presence may result in decreased energy consumption due to disrupted foraging activity. Without proper management, the observed behavioral changes may be detrimental to individuals within this population in the short term, with potential long-term consequences to health and survivorship."
https://openalex.org/W2908799441,"Background There is significant heterogeneity in the clinical expression of structural brain abnormalities, including Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers. Some individuals preserve their memory despite the presence of risk factors or pathological brain changes, indicating resilience. We aimed to test whether resilient individuals could be distinguished from those who develop cognitive impairment, using sociodemographic variables and neuroimaging. Methods We included 550 older adults participating in the Whitehall II study with longitudinal data, cognitive test results, and multi-modal MRI. Hippocampal atrophy was defined as Scheltens Scores >0. Resilient individuals (n = 184) were defined by high cognitive performance despite hippocampal atrophy (HA). Non-resilient participants (n = 133) were defined by low cognitive performance (≥1.5 standard deviations (S.D.) below the group mean) in the presence of HA. Dynamic and static exposures were evaluated for their ability to predict later resilience status using multivariable logistic regression. In a brain-wide analysis we tested for group differences in the integrity of white matter (structural connectivity) and resting-state networks (functional connectivity). Findings Younger age (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.92, p<0.001), higher premorbid FSIQ (OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.10, p<0.0001) and social class (OR 1 vs. 3: 4.99, 95% CI: 1.30 to 19.16, p = 0.02, OR 2 vs. 3: 8.43, 95% CI: 1.80 to 39.45, p = 0.007) were independently associated with resilience. Resilient individuals could be differentiated from non-resilient participants by higher fractional anisotropy (FA), and less association between anterior and posterior resting state networks. Higher FA had a significantly more positive effect on cognitive performance in participants with HA, compared to those without. Conclusions Resilient individuals could be distinguished from those who developed impairments on the basis of sociodemographic characteristics, brain structural and functional connectivity, but not midlife lifestyles. There was a synergistic deleterious effect of hippocampal atrophy and poor white matter integrity on cognitive performance. Exploiting and supporting neural correlates of resilience could offer a fresh approach to postpone or avoid the appearance of clinical symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2917861605,"Background Tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) and uveitis syndrome (TINU) are likely to be autoimmune diseases. Based on previous studies, adults with isolated idiopathic uveitis have polymorphisms in interleukin 10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) genes. We aimed to evaluate the presence of IL-10 and TNF-α polymorphisms in a nationwide cohort of pediatric TIN/TINU patients. Methods Single nucleotide polymorphisms in IL-10 (+434T/C, +504G/T, -1082G/A, -2849C/T) and in TNFα (-308G/A, -238G/A, -857C/T) genes were genotyped in 30 well-defined pediatric patients with idiopathic TIN/TINU syndrome. Control group frequencies for these SNPs were obtained from 393 independent Finnish subjects. Results The homozygous minor allele in IL-10 +434T (rs2222202) and IL-10+504G (rs3024490) was found in all patients with TIN or TINU syndrome while the frequency of these minor alleles in the control population was 44% and 23%, respectively (p <0.001). In IL-10 SNP -2849 (rs6703630) a significant difference was found with genotype TT in all patients (p = 0.004) and in subgroups with TINU syndrome (p = 0.017) and TINU syndrome with chronic uveitis (p = 0.01) compared to reference population. There were no statistical differences in any of the studied TNF-α genotypes between TIN/TINU patients and control population. Conclusions A significant difference in the frequency of IL-10+434T and +504G alleles was found between TIN/TINU patients and control population. Genotype -2849TT was more frequently present in patients with TINU syndrome than in the reference subjects. Genetic variation in the inflammatory mediators may predispose to autoimmune nephritis and uveitis."
https://openalex.org/W2917997745,"Objective The recent refugee crisis has resulted in the largest burden of displacement in history, with the US being the top resettlement country since 1975. Texas welcomed the second most US-bound refugees in 2016, with a large percentage arriving in San Antonio. Yet, the composition of the San Antonio refugees has not been described and their healthcare needs remain ill-defined. Through this study, we aim at elucidating their demographics and healthcare profiles, with the goal of devising recommendations to help guide refugee program development and guide other refugee resettlement programs. Methods Data from 731 charts belonging to 448 patients at the San Antonio Refugee Health Clinic (SARHC) were extracted and analyzed. Data included age, gender, country of origin, first language, interpretation need, health insurance status, medical history, vital signs, diagnoses, and prescribed medications. Results Women constituted the majority of patients (n = 267; 56.4%), and the median age of all patients was 39 (Q1:26, Q3:52). Nepali-speaking Bhutanese patients were the most represented group (n = 107, 43.1%), followed by Iraqi (n = 35, 14.1%), Burmese (n = 30, 12.1%), and Iranian (n = 19, 7.7%) refugees. Of those who responded, 200 (86.6%) did not have any form of health insurance. Additionally, 262 (50.9%) had a body-mass index (BMI) in the overweight or obese range. Further, 61.4% (n = 337) had blood pressures in the hypertensive range, while 9.3% (n = 51) had an elevated blood pressure. On average, each patient had 1.9 complaints, with abdominal pain, headaches, and cough being the predominant complaints. Allergic rhinitis, viral upper respiratory infections, and elevated blood pressure were the most common diagnoses. However, the list of common diagnoses differed per country of origin. Conclusion The SARHC demographics were different from those of other Texas refugees. The rate of the uninsured and the burden of non-communicable diseases were high. Furthermore, each refugee subgroup had a different set of common problems. These findings reveal important considerations for refugee healthcare providers and the unique approach that may be required for different communities."
https://openalex.org/W2915241193,"This work extends the understanding of how toxic exposures to amphetamine (AMPH) adversely affect the immune system and lead to tissue damage. Importantly, it determines which effects of AMPH are and are not due to pronounced hyperthermia. Whole blood messenger RNA (mRNA) and whole blood and serum microRNA (miRNA) transcripts were identified in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats after exposure to toxic AMPH under normothermic conditions, AMPH when it produces pronounced hyperthermia, or environmentally-induced hyperthermia (EIH). mRNA transcripts with large increases in fold-change in treated relative to control rats and very low expression in the control group were a rich source of organ-specific transcripts in blood. When severe hyperthermia was produced by either EIH or AMPH, significant increases in circulating organ-specific transcripts for liver (Alb, Fbg, F2), pancreas (Spink1), bronchi/lungs (F3, Cyp4b1), bone marrow (Np4, RatNP-3b), and kidney (Cesl1, Slc22a8) were observed. Liver damage was suggested also by increased miR-122 levels in the serum. Increases in muscle/heart-enriched transcripts were produced by AMPH even in the absence of hyperthermia. Expression increases in immune-related transcripts, particularly Cd14 and Vcan, indicate that AMPH can activate the innate immune system in the absence of hyperthermia. Most transcripts specific for T-cells decreased 50–70% after AMPH exposure or EIH, with the noted exception of Ccr5 and Chst12. This is probably due to T-cells leaving the circulation and down-regulation of these genes. Transcript changes specific for B-cells or B-lymphoblasts in the AMPH and EIH groups ranged widely from decreasing ≈ 40% (Cd19, Cd180) to increasing 30 to 100% (Tk1, Ahsa1) to increasing ≥500% (Stip1, Ackr3). The marked increases in Ccr2, Ccr5, Pld1, and Ackr3 produced by either AMPH or EIH observed in vivo provide further insight into the initial immune system alterations that result from methamphetamine and AMPH abuse and could modify risk for HIV and other viral infections."

This is due to the difficulty in eliminating viral covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA, which is central to the gene expression and replication of HBV. We developed an assay system for nuclear circular DNA using an integration-deficient lentiviral vector. This vector produced non-integrated circular DNA in nuclei of infected cells. We engineered this vector to encode firefly luciferase to monitor the lentiviral episome DNA. We screened 3,840 chemicals by this assay for luciferase-reducing activity and identified dicumarol, which is known to have anticoagulation activity. We confirmed that dicumarol reduced lentiviral episome DNA. Furthermore, dicumarol inhibited HBV replication in cell culture using NTCP-expressing HepG2 and primary human hepatocytes. Dicumarol reduced intracellular HBV RNA, DNA, supernatant HBV antigens and DNA. We also found that dicumarol reduced the cccDNA level in HBV infected cells, but did not affect HBV adsorption/entry. This is a novel assay system for screening inhibitors targeting nuclear cccDNA and is useful for finding new antiviral substances for HBV."
https://openalex.org/W2917426242,"Objectives To evaluate the associations of pre-endoscopy anxiety with discomfort and tolerance in patients undergoing unsedated esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Methods This is a hospital-based cohort study of 348 patients undergoing routine, non-advanced EGD without sedation. The primary outcomes were discomfort and tolerance. The anxiety before endoscopy was evaluated with a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS). The associations of pre-endoscopy anxiety with the outcomes were evaluated with logistic regression adjusting for potential confounders like age, sex, and body mass index. Results Seventy patients reported severe discomfort and 56 patients reported poor tolerance after endoscopy. The risk of severe discomfort increased with pre-endoscopy anxiety and reached a platform around 7–10 points. Compared with the participants with low pre-endoscopy anxiety, those with moderate (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17 to 6.22) and high level of anxiety (adjusted OR 6.87, 95% CI 2.16 to 21.79) were associated with a gradual increase in the risk of severe discomfort (P-trend < 0.001). The association between pre-endoscopy anxiety and tolerance was linear, with an adjusted OR of 1.67(95% CI 1.33 to 2.08) for a 1-score increase in pre-endoscopy anxiety VAS. The associations were not modified by age, sex, pharyngitis, duration of endoscopy, and diameter of the endoscope. Conclusions Pre-endoscopy anxiety was an independent predictor of severe discomfort and poor tolerance in Chinese patients undergoing unsedated EGD. Our findings suggested the importance of the management of anxiety to reduce adverse endoscopic experience and taking high level of anxiety as an indication for sedation."
https://openalex.org/W2912259386,"Although note taking during trials is known to enhance jurors’ recall of trial evidence, little is known about whether individual differences in note taking underpin this effect. Individual differences in handwriting speed, working memory, and attention may influence juror’s note taking. This, in turn, may influence their recall. It may also be the case that if jurors note down and recall more incriminating than non-incriminating evidence (or vice versa), then this may predict their verdict. Three studies examined the associations between the aforementioned individual differences, the amount of critical evidence jurors noted down during a trial, the amount of critical evidence they recalled, and the verdicts they reached. Participants had their handwriting speed, short-term memory, working memory, and attention assessed. They then watched a trial video (some took notes), reached a verdict, and recalled as much trial information as possible. We found that jurors with faster handwriting speed (Study 1), higher short-term memory capacity (Study 2), and higher sustained attention capacity (Study 3) noted down, and later recalled, the most critical trial evidence. However, working memory storage capacity, information processing ability (Study 2) and divided attention (Study 3) were not associated with note taking or recall. Further, the type of critical evidence jurors predominantly recalled predicted their verdicts, such that jurors who recalled more incriminating evidence were more likely to reach a guilty verdict, and jurors who recalled more non-incriminating evidence were less likely to do so. The implications of these findings are discussed."

In this paper, we point out that the security and efficiency claims given by Wang et al. are flawed. Specifically, we show that it is possible to solve finite field discrete logarithm problems defined over their elliptic curves in practice. On the elliptic curves with torsion points of 160 bits orders generated by Wang et al., their instances of finite field discrete logarithm problems are solved in around 4 hours by using a standard desktop PC. On the torsion points of 189 bits orders, their instances are solved in around 10 days by using two standard desktop PCs. The hardness of the finite field discrete logarithm problems is one of the most important bases of security; therefore, their elliptic curves should not be used for cryptographic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2915629237,"Test oracles are commonly used in software testing to determine the correctness of the execution results of test cases. However, the testing of many software systems faces the test oracle problem: a test oracle may not always be available, or it may be available but too expensive to apply. One such software system is a system involving abundant business processes. This paper focuses on the testing of business-process-based software systems and proposes a metamorphic testing approach for event sequences, called MTES, to alleviate the oracle problem. We utilized event sequences to represent business processes and then applied the technique of metamorphic testing to test the system without using test oracles. To apply metamorphic testing, we studied the general rules for identifying metamorphic relations for business processes and further demonstrated specific metamorphic relations for individual case studies. Three case studies were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. The experimental results show that our approach is feasible and effective in testing the applications with rich business processes. In addition, this paper summarizes the experimental findings and proposes guidelines for selecting good metamorphic relations for business processes."
https://openalex.org/W2916322457,"Polysome profiling is a widely used method to monitor the translation status of mRNAs. Although it is theoretically a simple technique, it is labor intensive. Repetitive polysome fractionation rapidly generates a large number of samples to be handled in the downstream processes of protein elimination, RNA extraction and quantification. Here, we propose a multiplex polysome profiling experiment in which distinct cellular extracts are pooled before loading on the sucrose gradient for fractionation. We used the multiplexing method to study translation in E. coli. Multiplexing polysome profiling experiments provided similar mRNA translation status to that obtained with the non-multiplex method with comparable distribution of mRNA copies between the polysome profiling fractions, similar ribosome occupancy and ribosome density. The multiplexing method was used for parallel characterization of gene translational responses to changing mRNA levels. When the mRNA level of two native genes, cysZ and lacZ was increased by transcription induction, their global translational response was similar, with a higher ribosome load leading to increased ribosome occupancy and ribosome densities. However the pattern and the magnitude of the translational response were gene specific. By reducing the number of polysome profiling experiments, the multiplexing method saved time and effort and reduced cost and technical bias. This method would be useful to study the translational effect of mRNA sequence-dependent parameters that often require testing multiple samples and conditions in parallel."
