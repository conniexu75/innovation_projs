The relationship of the amino acid constitution of a protein, or of the protein component of a food product, to its nutritive value for the growing rat can be best revealed, in the absence of accurate values for the amino acid requirements, by computing for each protein, or protein mojety, the percentage deviations of the contents of each essential eamino acid, expressed per 16 gm. of nitrogen, from the corresponding contents of a protein mixture, such as that of whole egg. thart is almost completely digestible by the rat and utilizable in adolescent metabolism. This has been done for a series of twenty-eight proteins and protein mixtures for which satisfactory analyses have been secured for all of the essential amino acids.

2. From such computations, the essential amino acid limiting the nutritive efficiency of the protein will be revealed as that one whose percentage deficit from that of the standard protein (whole egg) is the greatest, due consideration being given to the limiting amino acids thus indicated agree with those determined in feeding experiments with only one or two exceptions.

3. The proteins of foods may be ranked in the order of decreasing nutritive efficiency on the basis of increasing percentage deficits (as above defined) in their respective limiting essential amino acids. These percentage deficits are highly correlated (r = -0.86) with the corresponding biological values determined by the nitrogen metabolism method. Little or no correlation exists between the chemical ratings of th proteins and their digestibility by the growing rat.

4. The biological value of a protein (y) may be roughly estimated from its maximum percentage deficit in an essential amino acid (x) by the equation: = 102 - 0.634x.

5. However, there are known instances in which the biological value of a protein, or protein mixture, and its chemical rating do not agree, for various reasons discussed in the text.

6. In particular, the nutritive value of cereal proteins may be greatly impaired bt the application of heat with no demonstrated alteration in their content of the essential amino acids.

7. A basis for prediciting the effect of heat on the biological value of a food protein is suggested."

The calculations involved are, however, somewhat formidable, and a systematic investigation became possible only recently, with the acquisition of a calculating machine, for which grateful acknowledgment is made to the Moray Endowment Research Fund of the University of Edinburgh. The results have fully justified expectation and indicate that the age of the earth, reckoned from the time when radiogenic lead first began to accumulate in earth-materials, is of the order 3,000 million years."

https://openalex.org/W112382788,"Kinetic analyses have indicated that moderate hydrostatic pressures, up to some 700 atmospheres, oppose reversible and irreversible denaturations of certain enzyme systems, apparent at temperatures above the normal optimum of the enzyme reaction, as well as at lower temperatures in the presence of denaturants such as alcohol (1-4). Qualitative observations have shown that such pressures also retard the precipitation of highly purified human serum globulin and egg albumin at 65° (5) and slow the destruction of specific antitoxic activity at the same temperature (6). In this study we have obtained quantitative data with regard to the influence of various pressures, up to 10,000 pounds per sq. in., and of low concentrations of ethyl alcohol on the time course of precipitation of human serum globulin (1) at 65° and pH 6.0."

More than 25gamma are needed when the diet contains sulfasuxidine. Evidence for the possible indirect action of folic acid is summarized. Vitamin C or whole liver powder gives a slight response in the presence of adequate amounts of synthetic folic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2008475122,"FLUORESCENCE microspectrography has hitherto chiefly been utilized for the localization of porphyrins in thin sections of tissue, especially of pathological deposits of porphyrins in the tissues. The characteristic fluorescence spectra of the porphyrins and the comparatively great concentration of porphyrins have facilitated the use of the method under such conditions. On the other hand, difficulties have been encountered in identifying other fluorescent substances in histological sections by fluorescence microspectrography."

https://openalex.org/W2081859608,"THE tissue test method1, 2 has proved useful in the diagnosis of mineral element deficiencies in a variety of crop plants. Using this technique, however, it has not been possible hitherto to detect deficiency-levels of manganese in plant extracts, due to the fact that Morgan's reagent (100 gm. sodium acetate and 30 ml. glacial acetic acid per 1 litre at pH. 4.8) does not extract sufficient manganese from healthy or manganese-deficient tissues to be detected by the formaldoxime test2. The minimum concentration for which this reagent can be used is 1 part in 5 million. The value of the latter reagent in detecting excessive concentrations of manganese in plant tissue extracts has been reported previously2, 3, 4."

https://openalex.org/W2064364534,"THE aims of prehistoric archæology are, broadly, to give an account of the nature and activities of man where no written history is yet available, defined both in time and space and in character. The definition in time first began to take shape about a hundred years ago ; the vital importance of that in space has been recognized principally during the last twenty-five years, when a geographical approach has been seen to be indispensable to inquiries into matters both of time and of the character of prehistoric culture. These inquiries may be made either primarily from the 'historical' point of view, or primarily from the 'anthropological', aiming beyond simple definition in time and space at the fullest possible presentation of prehistoric cultural character. Each point of view has its appropriate methods, and, being essentially complementary, the two are accustomed to converge in the attainment of results ; but roughly speaking the 'historical' approach, which is the older established and uses the more purely archæological"
https://openalex.org/W1989114683,"THE following formulæ are proposed to measure the maximum rate of progress of selection for dominant quantitative genes. To simplify the problem, certain assumptions are made: (1) Selection begins in the F2 generation of a cross between two pure lines. (2) All genes are dominant in the positive direction. (3) Environmental effects are ignored, selection always being for the phenotypic class of maximum expression. This determines the maximum rate of progress, which would never be attained in actual practice. (4) All genes have either equal additive effects, when data are treated arithmetically, or equal geometric effects, when data should be treated logarithmically."

https://openalex.org/W4214494081,"J. FRANKLIN YAEGER of the U.S. Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine (J. Agric. Research, 71, 1 ; 1945) has prepared a very detailed paper on this subject. Under the title of “The Blood Picture of the Southern Armyworm (Prodenia eridania)”, the hsemocytes of this species of caterpillar are described, identified and classified. Also their incidence and changes at different stages in the development of the insect were noted. The blood cells or hsemocytes of insects, it may be added, are analogous to the leucocytes of vertebrates and form part of the defence mechanism against bacteria and other foreign bodies. There is evidence that the functions of these cells may be changed by the action of insecticides, but little progress is likely to be made as regards this problem until we know more about insect hsemocytes in general."

https://openalex.org/W4249867104,"THE speech which Sir John Boyd Orr delivered in the debate in the House of Commons on the world food shortage on April 4 is important in that it sets the problem in its true perspective and indicates the contribution to be expected from the Food and Agricultural Organisation. Sir John was concerned neither to attack nor defend the Government ; indeed, he is of opinion that any Government in power and any Food Minister would have been faced with the same difficulties and with much of the same criticism. The over-riding fact is the world food shortage and the inequitable distribution of available food ; and the temporary crisis, with which the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Combined Food Board are dealing, and the long-term planning necessary to relieve the world for ever from hunger and malnutrition are clearly related."
