Familial tumoral calcinosis is associated with hyperphosphatemia and massive ectopic calcifications. Here, we demonstrate that the secretion of the phosphaturic factor fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) requires O-glycosylation, and that GalNAc-T3 selectively directs O-glycosylation in a subtilisin-like proprotein convertase recognition sequence motif, which blocks processing of FGF23. The study suggests a novel posttranslational regulatory model of FGF23 involving competing O-glycosylation and protease processing to produce intact FGF23.

GalNAc-T3 is a member of the large polypeptide GalNAc transferase gene family containing 20 genes of which 15 have been shown to encode functional enzymes. The GalNAc-transferase gene family is the largest mammalian family of glycosyltransferases, which are involved in catalysis of a single glycosidic linkage, GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr, and collectively the GalNAc-transferase isoforms control the initiation of mucin-type O-glycosylation in the Golgi complex (3Hassan H.

Mucin-type O-glycosylation is one of the most abundant forms of glycosylation of proteins, and is found on a large variety of cell membrane and secreted glycopeptides and glycoproteins. O-Glycosylation imparts unique physicochemical features to glycoproteins and O-glycans have been shown to play important functions in almost all known biological processes including intracellular sorting, cell-cell adhesion, and microbial adhesion events (5Jentoft N.

Thus, FGF23 mutations affecting folding and secretion were identified in FTC patients without mutations in GalNAc-T3. Furthermore, ablation of FGF23 in mice leads to hyperphosphatemia resembling FTC (11Shimada T. Kakitani M. Yamazaki Y. Hasegawa H. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Tomizuka K. Yamashita T. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). FTC patients with mutations in GalNAc-T3 or FGF23 exhibit hyperphosphatemia and have reduced serum intact FGF23 levels, which may suggest that GalNAc-T3 and FGF23 act in a common pathway. GalNAc-T3 and FGF23 were found to be co-expressed in a number of tissues (2Ichikawa S. Lyles K.W. Econs M.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 90: 2420-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). FGF23 is a key regulator of phosphate homeostasis (12White K.E. Evans W.E. O'Riordan J.L.H. Speer M.C. Econs M.J.

Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Endocrinolology. 2002; 143: 3179-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). FGF23 is partially processed intracellularly by subtilisin-like proprotein convertases (SPC) at the consensus sequence RXXR↓ (RHTR179) between Arg179 and Ser180 (14Shimada T. Muto T. Urakawa I.

This processing step appears to be essential in the regulation of phosphate homeostasis, because mutations in the SPC cleavage sequence prevent processing and result in autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (12White K.E. Evans W.E. O'Riordan J.L.H. Speer M.C. Econs M.J. Lorenz-Depiereux B. Grabowski M. Meitinger T. Strom T.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Many secreted proteins and peptides essential for regulation of biological activities are synthesized as inactive proproteins, which are subsequently activated by site-specific proteolysis mainly by SPCs to form the intact active forms (17Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20745-20748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Examples of inactivation of proteins by SPCs have emerged more recently including FGF23 (14Shimada T. Muto T. Urakawa I. Yoneya T. Yamazaki Y. Okawa K. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T.

Chem. 2005; 280: 10974-10980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the SPC site in FGF23 contains the sequence RHTR179↓ with a potential O-glycosylation site at Thr178. We hypothesized that O-glycosylation and in particular O-glycosylation directed by GalNAc-T3 could play a role for processing and secretion of FGF23. The results presented in this study demonstrate that secretion of FGF23 is dependent on O-glycosylation in CHO ldlD cells and that co-expression of GalNAc-T3 in these cells results in a marked increase of secretion. Furthermore, in vitro studies demonstrate that GalNAc-T3 can glycosylate the SPC signal sequence of FGF23 at Thr178, which suggests that the underlying mechanism for GalNAc-T3 involvement in FTC is at least in part a role in O-glycosylation of the furin protease consensus sequence in FGF23. Expression of FGF23 and Glycosyltransferases in CHO ldlD Cells—An expression construct of the entire coding sequence of human FGF23 cloned into pcDNA3.1/myc-His (C-terminal tags) was prepared as previously reported (15Benet-Pages A.

The 5′-end of GalNAc-T3 (nucleotide 1–1032) was amplified by PCR using primer pair EHBC238 (5′-GCGGGATCCGTCAGAATGGCTCACCTAAAGCGA-3′)/EBHC222 (5′-ATCAGGAAGCGACTCCCAGCC-3′) with salivary gland mRNA (Clontech). An internal EcoRI site was used together with the BamHI site contained in EBHC238 to directionally clone the entire 5′-end of GalNAc-T3 into an existing secreted GalNAc-T3 construct (20Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The full coding core 3 β3GnT6 construct was amplified using primer pair MTHC2307 (5′-GCGGATCCACCATGGCTTTTCCCTGCCGCAGG-3′)/MTHC2302 (5′-GCGAATTCTCAGGAGACCCGGTGTCCCCG-3′) with human genomic DNA, and the product was cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI site of pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Both constructs were cloned into pcDNA3.1. Chinese hamster ovary mutant cells, CHO ldlD (22Kingsley D.M. Kozarsky K.F. Segal M. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1576-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), with defective UDP-Gal/UDP-GalNAc 4-epimerase were grown in Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1, v/v) supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum and 0.03% glutamine. Cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 constructs and stable transfectants were selected in 0.4 mg/ml G418 and/or 0.4 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) using immunostaining for expression of FGF23 (monoclonal anti-myc antibody (Invitrogen)) and GalNAc-T3 (monoclonal antibody UH5) (23Bennett E.P.

In the case of core 3 β3GnT6, stable transfectants were selected by loss of reactivity with an anti-Tn (GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr) monoclonal antibody (5F4) when cells were grown in medium with 1 mm GalNAc (24Sorensen A.L.

To evaluate the effects of O-glycosylation CHO ldlD transfectant cells were grown in medium supplemented with 0.1 mm Gal, 1 mm GalNAc, or a combination. Immunocytology—Immunostaining of CHO ldlD cells was performed with washed air-dried cells on multiwell slides using fixation with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100. Slides were incubated with monoclonal antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (F261, Dako) and examination on a Zeiss fluorescence microscope using epi-illumination. ELISA for Quantification of FGF23—A commercial ELISA kit for quantification of intact FGF23 was used with culture medium from CHO ldlD transfectant cells according to the manufacturer's protocol (Kainos Laboratories International). Culture medium from cells was diluted to 1:500 and the assay run with an internal standard. Glycosyltransferase Assays and Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Glycopeptides—All glycosyltransferases were expressed as soluble secreted truncated proteins in insect cells as previously described (24Sorensen A.L.

Peptides were custom synthesized by Schafer-N (Copenhagen, Denmark). Microsomal fractions derived from 200 μl of packed cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 1 h, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant used for assays with or without immuno-clearance of human GalNAc-T3. Immuno-clearance was performed by incubating the supernatant overnight with anti-GalNAc-T3 monoclonal antibody UH5 (23Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Mandel U. Hollingsworth M.A. Akisawa N. Ikematsu Y.

The resulting supernatants were used for GalNAc-transferase assays and incorporation of GalNAc was quantified by scintillation counting after Dowex-1 chromatography. Synthesis of glycopeptides was performed sequentially with HPLC purification between each step.

MALDI-TOF MS Analysis—Evaluation of the number of GalNAc residues and subsequently Gal and NeuAc residues incorporated into peptides was done by MALDI-TOF MS as previously described (24Sorensen A.L.

Briefly, 0.5 μl of enzyme reaction mixtures were diluted with 3.5 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, H2O, and 1 μl was applied and mixed with 1 μl of 25 mg/ml 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid dissolved in H2O/CH3CN (2:1) solution. Mass spectra were obtained on a Voyager-DE™ instrument (Applied Biosystems) operating at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV (grid voltage 96.5%, guide wire voltage 0.05%) in the linear mode with the delayed extraction setting. Recorded data were processed using GRAMS software. In Vitro Furin Cleavage Assay—An in vitro SPC cleavage assay with a human furin protease (Sigma) was developed with FGF23-related peptides covering the RHTR cleavage site. Assays were performed in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol using 10 μg of (glyco)peptides substrate and 1 unit of enzyme in a total volume of 50 μl with incubations at 37 °C for 1, 4, and 24 h. Product development was evaluated by MALDI-TOF. The effects of O-glycosylation of FGF23 were studied using the CHO ldlD mutant cell line. This cell line was originally developed and used to demonstrate that O-glycosylation of the low density lipoprotein receptor was required for stable cell-surface expression by preventing proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain (30Kozarsky K.F. Call S.M. Dower S.K. Krieger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3357-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). CHO ldlD cells are deficient in the UDP-Gal/UDP-GalNAc 4-epimerase, which catalyzes the reaction from UDP-glucose to UDP-galactose. The defect can be selectively restored by addition of GalNAc and/or Gal. Interestingly, addition of GalNAc alone results in O-glycosylation limited to GalNAc with no apparent elongation or sialylation (24Sorensen A.L. Reis C.A. Tarp M.A. Mandel U. Ramachandran K. Sankaranarayanan V. Schwientek T. Graham R. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Hollingsworth M.A. Burchell J. Clausen H. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), whereas the substitution of GalNAc and Gal leads to a complete restoration of O-glycosylation. Secretion of FGF23 Is Dependent on GalNAc O-Glycosylation—FGF23 has previously been expressed in CHO cells and both intact 32 kDa and processed fragments are secreted suggesting that CHO cells process FGF23 partially (31Shimada T. Mizutani S. Muto T. Yoneya T. Hino R. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Bone. 2001; 28: S89Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 secretion of FGF23 in CHO ldlD cells requires O-glycosylation with at least GalNAc, and the level of secretion is dramatically increased when GalNAc-T3 is co-expressed. All cells were characterized for expression of respective genes by immunocytology (Fig. 1A) and SDS-PAGE Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B, top panel). The stable transfectants of CHO ldlD cells with FGF23 alone or subsequent introduced GalNAc-T3 or control β3GnT6 expressed similar levels of FGF23 evaluated by anti-Myc reactivity. The β3GnT6 construct encodes the human β3GlcNAc-transferase that forms the core 3 mucin-type O-linked structure (GlcNAcβ1–3GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr), and is expected to elongate and mask the Tn structures expressed in CHO ldlD cells grown in only GalNAc (21Iwai T. Inaba N. Naundorf A. Zhang Y. Gotoh M. Iwasaki H. Kudo T. Togayachi A. Ishizuka Y. Nakanishi H. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12802-12809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The GalNAc-T3 transfectant cells exhibited the expected supranuclear Golgi-like staining (23Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Mandel U. Hollingsworth M.A. Akisawa N. Ikematsu Y. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Olofsson S. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25362-25370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). CHO ldlD cells grown in GalNAc-substituted medium express very little Tn glycoproteins (Fig. 1A), but cells transfected with FGF23 as well as FGF23 and GalNAc-T3 produced the expected diffuse cytoplasmic staining with anti-Tn (GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr). This suggests that indeed FGF23 is GalNAc-glycosylated in cells grown in GalNAc (Fig. 1A). The control β3GnT6-transfected cells when grown in GalNAc exhibited marked reduction in reactivity with anti-Tn compared with the parent FGF23 cells, in agreement with the expected function of this enzyme in elongation of Tn to core 3 structures (GlcNAcβ1–3Gal-NAcα1-O-Ser/Thr). Analysis of lysates of all transfectant cells grown with or without addition of sugars by anti-myc Western blotting revealed comparable levels of intracellular FGF23, although there was a clear tendency that cells grown in GalNAc as well as GalNAc and Gal exhibited slightly reduced levels compared with cells grown without GalNAc (Fig. 1B, top panel). Cell lysates contained a major anti-myc reactive protein with a molecular mass of ∼30 kDa with a trace of a higher molecular mass band of 32 kDa. The upper band does not appear to represent an O-glycosylated glycoform because it does not vary with growth conditions of cells, i.e. presence or absence of added Gal or GalNAc. Analysis of FGF23 levels in medium of cells grown for 72 h by Western blot analysis as well as ELISA showed complete lack of FGF23 when cells were grown without GalNAc, whereas two distinct molecular species of ∼31 and 32 kDa were found in the medium when cells were grown in GalNAc or GalNAc and Gal, respectively (Fig. 1, B and C). CHO ldlD cells grown in both GalNAc and Gal produce sialylated core 1 structures, which should account for the apparent higher molecular weight. A faint band of ∼14 kDa was also observed in medium from all cells grown in GalNAc, which represents the C-terminal myc-tagged fragment (FGF23-(180–251)) (14Shimada T. Muto T. Urakawa I. Yoneya T. Yamazaki Y. Okawa K. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Endocrinolology. 2002; 143: 3179-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). ELISA analysis of levels of secreted FGF23 from CHO ldlD FGF23 and the double FGF23 and β3GnT6 transfectants showed low or undetectable levels, whereas the GalNAc-T3 transfectant cells showed a marked increase. This increase was especially significant with cells grown in both GalNAc and Gal, which suggests that GalNAc-glycosylation alone promotes secretion to a lesser degree than the more complex glycosylation achieved with addition of Gal and GalNAc. Interestingly, lack of GalNAc-T3 does not appear to result in significant intracellular accumulation of FGF23 or degradation products (Fig. 1B). The major anti-myc reactive species of ∼30 kDa in cell lysates did appear to exhibit a weak inverse correlation with levels of secreted FGF23. It may therefore be assumed that rapid degradation controls the intracellular pool similar to what was observed with a FGF23 mutant in HEK293 cells (8Benet-Pages A. Orlik P. Strom T.M. Lorenz-Depiereux B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). O-Glycosylation Capacity in CHO ldlD Cells—The remarkable induction of secretion of FGF23 by co-expression of GalNAc-T3 suggests that CHO ldlD cells do not express an endogenous hamster GalNAc-T3 ortholog or other GalNAc-transferase isoforms with the same specificity; however, the repertoire of GalNAc-transferases in CHO ldlD cells is unknown. To evaluate the presence of such activity, we tested detergent lysates of CHO ldlD cells for GalNAc-transferase activity with a peptide sequence derived from FGF23 (FGF23b) and a MUC1-derived peptide sequence as control (Table 1). CHO ldlD cell lysates contained significant activity with Muc1a peptide and essentially no detectable activity with the FGF23b peptide. The GalNAc-T3 CHO ldlD transfectant cell lysates contained almost 2-fold higher activity with Muc1a and significant activity with the FGF23 peptide. Clearing the lysates with anti-GalNAc-T3 immobilized antibodies resulted in selective removal of the activity with FGF23. We did test for activity in the immunoprecipitates, because our previous studies of immunoprecipitation of soluble recombinant GalNAc-T3 by UH5 was found to be active (32Mandel U. Hassan H. Therkildsen M.H. Rygaard J. Jakobsen M.H. Juhl B.R. Dabelsteen E. Clausen H. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), however, no activity above background could be demonstrated in precipitates of CHO ldlD GalNAc-T3 cells. This is likely due to the fact that the enzyme is the membrane-bound form, which is known to be very unstable. These experiments indicate that CHO ldlD cells do not express GalNAc-T3 or isoforms with FGF23 substrate specificities in a significant degree. We have previously identified unique in vitro substrate specificities for the GalNAc-T3 isoform and its close subfamily member GalNAc-T6 (23Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Mandel U.

One peptide substrate identified from the V3-loop of HIV gp120 has been confirmed as an exclusive in vivo substrate for GalNAc-T3 in COS7 cells, which is the only available correlation of in vitro and in vivo functions of GalNAc-transferases to date (33Nehrke K.

Mechanical strain stimulated cardiovascular differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells as evaluated by quantification of contracting cardiac foci and capillary areas, respectively. Mechanical strain rapidly elevated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). After 24 h up-regulation of NADPH oxidase subunits p22-phox, p47-phox, p67-phox, and Nox-4 as well as Nox-1 and Nox-4 mRNA was observed. In parallel, mechanical strain increased hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA and protein as well as MEF2C and GATA-4 mRNA, which are involved in cardiovascular development. Furthermore, phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated kinase 1,2 (ERK1,2), p38, and c-jun N-terminal kinase (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)) was observed. Stimulation of cardiovascular commitment, HIF-1alpha, VEGF, and MEF2C expression as well as MAPK activation were abolished by free radical scavengers, whereas GATA-4 expression was increased. Cardiomyogenesis was inhibited by the p38 inhibitor SB203580, the ERK1,2 inhibitor UO126, and the JNK inhibitor SP600125. Vasculogenesis/angiogenesis was blunted following inhibition of ERK1,2 and JNK, whereas p38 inhibition was ineffective. Our data outline a role of ROS as mechanotransducing molecules in mechanical strain-stimulated cardiovascular differentiation of ES cells, and point toward a microenvironment of elevated ROS required for signaling cascades initiating cardiovascular differentiation programs."

For example, Ras-transformed fibroblasts overproduce superoxide, and ROS generation is inhibited by a dominant negative mutant form of Rac1 (6Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J. Sollott S. Der C. Rearon E.

Despite a clear association between Rac1 and ROS production in a variety of cells, the ROS-generating target(s) of Rac1 have not been convincingly elucidated, and the source has been speculated to be either mitochondria or an unknown Nox enzyme. This study presents evidence in a model cell system that Nox1 can mediate Rac1-induced ROS generation in nonphagocytic cells. The phagocyte NADPH-oxidase provides a paradigm for regulation of ROS generation by Rac (12Dinauer M.C. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2003; 10: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit gp91phox contains one FAD, two hemes, and an NADPH binding site (13Vignais P.V. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1428-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) and is associated in the membrane with p22phox, which provides both stabilization and a docking site for regulatory subunits. Together, gp91phox and p22phox constitute flavocytochrome b558, which functions catalytically in neutrophils and monocytes in conjunction with the regulatory subunits p47phox, p67phox, p40phox and the small GTPase Rac2. In vitro, both Rac1 and Rac2 support NADPH-oxidase activity (14Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 15Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Evans T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1991; 254: 1512-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), but in phagocytes from Rac1 or Rac2 knock-out animals, the system shows greater specificity for Rac2 (16Glogauer M. Marchal C.C. Zhu F. Worku A. Clausen B.E. Foerster I. Marks P. Downey G.P. Dinauer M. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5652-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 17Kim C. Dinauer M.C. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1223-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), which is selectively expressed in phagocytic cells. In naive neutrophils not exposed to bacteria or inflammatory mediators, flavocytochrome b558 is catalytically inactive, and its regulatory subunits p47phox and p67phox are located in the cytosol. Similarly, Rac in resting cells is complexed to GDP and is associated in the cytosol with the inhibitor protein RhoGDI (18DerMardirossian C. Bokoch G.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 356-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Upon exposure of cells to chemical activators or bacteria, p47phox (and possibly other subunits) becomes phosphorylated, triggering conformational changes that result in its translocation to the membrane and assembly with the flavocytochrome. Similarly, cell activation results in activation of one or more guanine nucleotide exchange factors, causing exchange of GDP for GTP on Rac, dissociation from RhoGDI, and translocation to the membrane where Rac binds to the flavocytochrome. Both Rac and p47phox contain binding sites for different regions of p67phox, which also translocates to the membrane, where it is oriented and held in place with the assistance of Rac and p47phox. The “activation domain” of p67phox (19Han C.-H. Freeman J.L.R. Lee T. Motalebi S.A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

The net result of cell activation, then, is to induce subunit assembly and activation of the enzyme. Nox1 is the first member to be described of a family of homologs of gp91phox (21Suh Y.-A.

Nature. 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar) that now numbers seven members in humans (22Lambeth J.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar). Nox1-dependent ROS generation can be reconstituted in cells by co-transfection with the regulatory subunits NOXO1 and NOXA1 (23Cheng G. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4737-4742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 24Banfi B. Clark R.A. Steger K. Krause K.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 25234-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). NOXO1 is a homolog of p47phox, and NOXA1 is a homolog of p67phox. Unlike p47phox and p67phox, NOXO1 and NOXA1 are co-localized with Nox1 in membranes in unstimulated cells (23Cheng G. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4737-4742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and therefore do not require cell activation for assembly at the membrane. This is consistent with the structure of NOXO1, which lacks an autoinhibitory region (AIR) that is present in p47phox and is the target of regulatory phosphorylations. In naive phagocytes, the AIR binds internally to the tandem Src homology 3 region (bis-Src homology 3) of p47phox, blocking its interaction with p22phox. Phosphorylation of AIR upon phagocyte activation relieves this inhibition, permitting association and assembly to occur. Therefore, the absence of the AIR in NOXO1 probably accounts in part for the ability of NOXO1 to assemble with Nox1 in resting cells (23Cheng G. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4737-4742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In addition, the PX domain of NOXO1 binds to phospholipids that are present in naive cells, allowing localization of NOXO1 to the membrane (23Cheng G. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4737-4742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Whereas less is known about NOXA1, this protein has an activation domain that is highly homologous to that present in p67phox. NOXA1 also contains a TPR domain that associates with Rac1 in yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays (26Takeya R. Ueno N. Kami K. Taura M. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Nunoi H. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25234-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). However, whether the NOXA1-Rac1 complex is functional in Nox1-dependent ROS production has not been demonstrated. Interestingly, in reconstitution studies using transfected cells (23Cheng G. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4737-4742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 24Banfi B. Clark R.A. Steger K. Krause K.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 25234-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), co-expression of Nox1, NOXO1, and NOXA1 results in the production of relatively high levels of reactive oxygen in several cell types without the need to co-express a small GTPase such as Rac1. In contrast, when gp91phox is expressed in HEK293 cells along with its regulatory subunits, there is an absolute requirement for co-expression of activated Rac in order to observe reactive oxygen generation (27Cheng G. Ritsick D.R. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34250-34255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The above results call into question whether a small GTPase is indeed required for Nox1-dependent activity. Whereas it is possible that Nox1 can function in the absence of a small GTPase, another hypothesis is that very low levels of endogenous activated small GTPases are sufficient for Nox1 activity, making it unnecessary to co-transfect an activated GTPase. The present studies were therefore designed to investigate whether Nox1 activity requires the small GTPase Rac1 for optimal ROS generation. Cells—HEK293H cells (Invitrogen) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Vectors Encoding Nox Enzymes and Regulatory Proteins—Cloning and subcloning of Nox1, Nox2 (gp91phox), NOXO1, NOXA1, p47phox, and p67phox were previously described (23Cheng G. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

(Myc)2-Rac1(G12V), Myc-Rac1 wild-type, and (HA)3-CDC42(G12V), in pcDNA3.1 were from the University of Missouri-Rolla cDNA Resource Center (Rolla, MO). (HA)3-Rac1(G12V) was constructed by amplifying HA and Rac1(G12V) separately and inserting these PCR products into pcDNA3.1. (HA)3-NOXA1 was constructed by inserting the NOXA1 PCR product into pCMV5-(HA)3. Myc-NOXO1 was constructed by inserting the PCR product of NOXO1 into the vector, pRK5(Myc). pRK5-Myc-PAK1 WT was kindly provided by Dr. Gary Bokoch (Scripps Research Institute). NOXA1(D68A) in pCMV-Sport6 was constructed by amplifying NOXA1 in pCMV-Sport6 using an SP6 primer and primer 1 (5′-AAG TTG GCC ACT CCT CGC TGG AAG AAG CCA ACC GCC ATG CAG GTGGCC TTG GTC ACG GCT TG-3′). Primer 1 introduces an MscI site (underlined) and changes (italics) codon 68 in NOXA1 from aspartic acid (D) to alanine (A). The PCR product was digested with XhoI and MscI. The digested fragment was inserted into XhoI and MscI sites of pCMV-Sport6/NOXA1 to replace the wild-type region. NOXA1(R103E) and NOXA1(D109A) in pCMV-Sport6 were made using an analogous strategy. NOXA1(D109A) also has a E100G mutation accidentally introduced by PCR. Transient Transfections—HEK293H cells were plated at 4 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates and grown overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin to reach to 40–50% confluence. Cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 or vectors harboring the insert gene using Fugene 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, cells were removed from the well and washed twice with cold Hanks' balanced salt solution containing calcium and magnesium. The cells were then pelleted at 1000 × g for 5 min and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species—Reactive oxygen was measured using luminol chemiluminescence as previously described (27Cheng G. Ritsick D.R. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay—The pM cloning vector (Clontech) contains a GAL4 DNA binding domain, and the vector of pVP16 (Clontech) encodes an activation domain from Herpes simplex virus V16 protein. Both pM and pVP16 were modified by adding KpnI sites in the multiple cloning sites upstream of their BamHI site. pG5CAT expresses a fusion protein consisting of five consensus GAL4 binding sites fused to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). pM3-VP16 is a positive control vector that expresses a fusion of the GAL4-BD and the VP16-AD. Full-length NOXA1 and its mutants, including NOXA1(D68A), NOXA1(R103E), and NOXA1(E100G/D109A), were subcloned into KpnI and BamHI sites of pM, whereas Rac1(G12V) and CDC42(G12V) were subcloned into KpnI and BamHI sites of pVP16. For detecting protein-protein interactions, HEK293H cells were co-transfected with 0.2 μg of pG5CAT along with 0.5 μg of pM (or its derivatives) plus 0.5 μg of pVP16 (or its derivatives) as indicated. Cells were harvested after 48 h and stored at –80 °C. CAT activity was assayed using the Fast CAT (deoxy)chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Briefly, frozen cells were resuspended in 100 μl of 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and lysed with three freeze-thaw cycles and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. 60 μl of supernatant was mixed with 10 μl of FAST CAT substrate solution and preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Then 10 μl of freshly prepared 9 mm acetyl-CoA was added and incubated at 37 °C for 2–3 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold ethyl acetate. The liquid phases were separated by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 3 min. 900 μl of ethyl acetate containing the reaction product was dried under vacuum, and the residue was redissolved in 20μl of ethyl acetate. A 5-μl aliquot was applied to a silica gel-60 thin layer chromatography plate (Merck), and separated using 85:15 (v/v) chloroform/methanol. The separated substrate and product were visualized under UV light and photographed using an Alphaimager™ (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Immunoprecipitation—HEK293H cells grown to ∼50% confluence on 10-cm plates were transfected with 5 μg of each plasmid indicated (Fig. 5), using FuGene 6. After 48 h, the cells were harvested by washing twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution. The cells were lysed in 600 μl of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). MgCl2 (60 mm) was included in the RIPA buffer for those experiments where Rac1 WT or endogenous Rac1 binding was examined. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and 1.5 mg protein of cleared lysate was used for each immunoprecipitation. The lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies with end-over-end rotation. The next morning, either 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (1:1 slurry; Sigma) or 20 μl of streptavidinagarose beads (Molecular Probes) was added to the mixtures and rotated for an additional 2.5 h at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted by centrifuging at 1,500 × g for 2 min and washed three times with cold RIPA buffer. The pellets were resuspended in 25 μl of RIPA buffer or RIPA buffer with 20 mm biotin. The immunocomplexes were analyzed by Western blotting and visualized by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate; Pierce). Antibodies—3 mg each of chicken anti-NOXO1 and anti-NOXA1 antibodies (23Cheng G. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4737-4742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 27Cheng G. Ritsick D.R. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

Anti-Nox1 E39.1 monoclonal antibody was previously described (23Cheng G. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4737-4742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and was the kind gift of Jackie Papkoff at diaDexus (S. San Francisco, CA). Anti-green fluorescent protein polyclonal antibody was purchased from ANASPEC, Inc. (San Jose, CA). Anti-Myc and anti-HA monoclonal antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technologies, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Anti-Rac1 and anti-CDC42 antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Charlottesville, VA). Rac Activation Assay—The endogenous GTP-associated form of Rac1 was detected using Rac/CDC42 Assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology), following the manufacturer's protocol. Similar to the above immunoprecipitation, HEK293H cells grown to confluence on 10-cm plates were harvested by washing twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution. The cells were lysed in 1× Mg2+ lysis buffer supplied by the manufacturer and supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. A total of four samples were prepared for each condition described in the legend to Fig. 1A. Two equal aliquots of the lysate were preloaded with either GTPγSor GDP as controls. A third equal aliquot was not preloaded. All three aliquots were then shaken with glutathione S-transferase-PAK1-(67–150) bound to glutathione-agarose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The fourth sample was composed of one-twenty-fifth of the volume of lysate that was used in the other three samples for the pull-down and was used directly for Western blotting. Beads were pelleted by centrifuging at 1,500 × g for 2 min and washed three times with cold Mg2+ lysis buffer provided by the kit. The pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and subjected to Western blotting. Rac1-GTP was visualized using an anti-Rac1 monoclonal antibody supplied with the kit (Upstate Biotechnology). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Lysate (60 μg of protein) was resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semidry electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) at 15 V for 1 h. In some experiments, 40 μg of cell lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using the Tank Transfer System (Bio-Rad). The proteins were detected using standard Western blotting and visualized by chemiluminescence as described above. Blots were stripped and reprobed as necessary. RNA Interference of Rac1 and CDC42—Nonspecific randomized control siRNA and Rac1 siRNA were purchased from Upstate USA, Inc. (catalog no. M-003560), whereas siRNA of CDC42 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) (catalog no. sc-29256). 200 pmol of control siRNA, Rac1 siRNA, and/or CDC42 siRNA were co-transfected into HEK293H cells in a 6-well plate with 0.5 μg each of Nox1, NOXO1, and NOXA1 using X-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After 72 h, the cells were harvested as described above. An aliquot of the cells was subject to luminol assay, and the remainder was used for Western blotting. Stimulation of Nox1-dependent ROS Production by Rac1—We previously reported that co-transfection of Nox1, NOXO1, and NOXA1 resulted in significant generation of ROS (23Cheng G. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4737-4742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In these earlier experiments, we failed to observe stimulation of Nox1-dependent ROS production by Rac1(G12V). Because these experiments used high concentrations of plasmids encoding Nox1, NOXO1, and NOXA1, this may have artifactually saturated Nox1 with its regulatory subunits, preventing further activation by Rac1. We therefore used relatively low concentrations of each plasmid in the present study. As shown in Fig. 1A, whereas significant ROS generation was still seen without co-expressed Rac1 and without phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation (Fig. 1A, lane 2), activity was increased slightly by expression of wild-type Rac1 (lane 3) and was further increased by expression of Rac1(G12V) (lane 4). To test whether there may have been endogenous Rac1-GTP present in these cells that might account for partial activation of Nox1 in the absence of Rac1(G12V), the content of endogenous Rac1GTP was evaluated using the Rac binding domain of PAK (PAK-(67–150)). This binding domain interacts exclusively with the GTP form of Rac1 and CDC42. As shown in the Western blot in Fig. 1B (top), Rac1 was seen in both the total cell lysate (lane 1) and in the PAK1 pull-down complex from lysates of untreated cells (lane 3). Because the pull-down complex was concentrated 25-fold compared with lysate and gave about 5% of the staining on the Western blot, compared with the band seen in the lysate, one can estimate that ∼0.2% of endogenous Rac1 is in the GTP-bound form. This was not affected by co-expression of Nox1, NOXA1, and NOXO1 (Fig. 1B, second panel). Co-transfection of Myc-tagged wild-type Rac1 WT along with Nox1, NOXA1, and NOXO1 did not result in an increase in the level of activated endogenous Rac1, but some activated Myc-tagged Rac1 WT was seen (Fig. 1B, third panel from the top). Finally, when Myc-Rac1(G12V) was co-expressed along with Nox1, NOXA1, and NOXO1, the PAK1 pull-down revealed both Rac1(G12V) and an increased level of endogenous activated Rac1 (Fig. 1B, bottom). For unknown reasons, Rac1(T17N) failed to inhibit ROS generation when co-expressed with Nox1, NOXO1, and NOXA1, perhaps because this cell type may utilize a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that is insensitive to inhibition by Rac1(T17N). The concentration dependence for Rac1(G12V) activation of Nox1 with and without PMA stimulation is shown in Fig. 1C. Without PMA, Nox1-dependent ROS generation was stimulated by Rac1(G12V) by ∼3-fold at the highest concentrations tested (1,000 ng). Rac2, which is expressed exclusively in phagocytic cells (28Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Kinsella B.T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), produced a similar -fold activation and dose dependence (data not shown). PMA caused up to 2-fold increase in basal activity in the absence of Rac1(G12V), and activity increased by a roughly constant amount throughout the Rac1(G12V) concentration range. We previously showed that Nox2, when co-expressed with p47phox, p67phox, and Rac1(G12V), can be activated by PMA (27Cheng G. Ritsick D.R. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34250-34255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As a control, we tested the dose dependence for activation of Nox2 by Rac1(G12V), as is shown in Fig. 1D. Nox2 activation absolutely required stimulation by PMA, and no basal activity was seen in the absence of Rac1(G12V). Thus, the quantity of endogenous Rac1-GTP in unstimulated cells is not sufficient to activate Nox2. The absolute requirement of PMA for Nox2, but not Nox1, activation is not surprising, since PMA-dependent phosphorylation of the AIR of p47phox and perhaps other components is well known (29Yuzawa S. Suzukik N.N. Fujioka Y. Ogura K. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Yuzawa S. Ogura K. Horiuchi M. Suzuki N.N. Fujiolka Y. Kataoka M. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29752-29760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whereas the AIR is absent in NOXO1. Interestingly, in a transgenic COS7 cell line stably expressing gp91phox, p22phox, p47phox, and p67phox, stimulus-independent ROS production was induced by transfection of Rac1(G12V) (31Price M. Atkinson S.J. Knaus U.G. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19220-19228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In these COSphox cells, transfection of Rac1(GV12) drove translocation of p47phox to the membrane, suggesting that Rac1 acts not only as a participant in the NADPH oxidase complex but also as a regulator of oxidase assembly. We were not able to compare the protein expression levels of Nox1 versus Nox2 in Fig. 1D due to the lack of an antibody that recognizes the same epit"
https://openalex.org/W2021477435,"Human glutathione S-transferase P1-1 (GSTP1-1) is an ubiquitously expressed protein that plays an important role in the detoxification and xenobiotics metabolism. It has been shown that GSTP1-1 interacts with c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and suppresses its activity. Here, we report a novel function of GSTP1-1 in regulating tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-triggered signaling. The present experiments showed that GSTP1-1 physically associated with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of GSTP1-1 inhibited TRAF2-induced activation of both JNK and p38 but not of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Glutathione S-transferase P1-1 also attenuated TRAF2-enhanced apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) autophosphorylation and inhibited TRAF2–ASK1-induced cell apoptosis by suppressing the interaction of TRAF2 and ASK1. Conversely, silencing of GSTP1-1 expression through RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in increase of TNF-α-dependent TRAF2–ASK1 association followed by hyper-activation of ASK1 and JNK. A mutant GSTP1-1 lacking TRAF domain-binding motif exhibited a significant decline of capacity to bind TRAF2 and block TRAF2–ASK1 signaling compared with the wild type of GSTP1-1. Moreover, the glutathione-conjugating activity of GSTP1-1 was not involved in the regulation of TRAF2 signaling. These findings indicate that GSTP1-1 plays an important regulatory role in TNF-α-induced signaling by forming ligand-binding interactions with TRAF2, which provides a new insight for analysing the protective effects of GSTP1-1 in tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2143002593,"Herpesviruses are the second leading cause of human viral diseases. Herpes Simplex Virus types 1 and 2 and Varicella-zoster virus produce neurotropic infections such as cutaneous and genital herpes, chickenpox, and shingles. Infections of a lymphotropic nature are caused by cytomegalovirus, HSV-6, HSV-7, and Epstein-Barr virus producing lymphoma, carcinoma, and congenital abnormalities. Yet another series of serious health problems are posed by infections in immunocompromised individuals. Common therapies for herpes viral infections employ nucleoside analogs, such as Acyclovir, and target the viral DNA polymerase, essential for viral DNA replication. Although clinically useful, this class of drugs exhibits a narrow antiviral spectrum, and resistance to these agents is an emerging problem for disease management. A better understanding of herpes virus replication will help the development of new safe and effective broad spectrum anti-herpetic drugs that fill an unmet need. Here, we present the first crystal structure of a herpesvirus polymerase, the Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 DNA polymerase, at 2.7 Å resolution. The structural similarity of this polymerase to other α polymerases has allowed us to construct high confidence models of a replication complex of the polymerase and of Acyclovir as a DNA chain terminator.

Only eight distinct viruses, spanning three subfamilies, designated α, β, and γ, of the greater than 80-member Herpesviridae family are known to cause clinically significant diseases in humans (1Coen D.M. Schaffer P.A. Nat. Rev. 2003; 2: 278-288Google Scholar). Herpesviruses possess a common replication cycle in which the viral polymerase (POL) 7The abbreviations used are: POL, DNA polymerase; HSV, Herpesvirus; HSV POL, herpes simplex 1 DNA polymerase; DHQ, dihydroquinolines; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 7The abbreviations used are: POL, DNA polymerase; HSV, Herpesvirus; HSV POL, herpes simplex 1 DNA polymerase; DHQ, dihydroquinolines; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. functions at multiple points and is thus an attractive target for the development of antiherpetic drugs (1Coen D.M.

Science. 1989; 244: 241-247Crossref Scopus (566) Google Scholar). However, drug resistances against these nucleotide analog drugs are severe, especially among the immunocompromised population (4Bacon T.H. Levin M.J. Leary J.J. Sarisky R.T. Sutton D. Clin.

Drug Resistance Update. 2002; 5: 88-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Alternative approaches, such as non-nucleotide drugs, may be needed (1Coen D.M. Schaffer P.A. Nat.

The Herpesvirus polymerases exhibit a 34-90% primary sequence identity and range in size from 1012 to 1242 amino acids. Herpes Simplex 1 DNA polymerase (HSV POL), the prototype for the herpesvirus POL family, has 1,235 amino acid residues and exhibits all the enzymatic functions of a polymerase (7Lehman I.R. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28059-28062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In addition to a polymerase activity required to extend the DNA primer chains, HSV POL possesses an intrinsic 3′-5′-exonuclease activity that serves as a proofreading activity to ensure the high fidelity of DNA replication (8Knopf K.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 98: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). HSV POL has also been reported to have an intrinsic RNase H activity that presumably functions in the removal of RNA primers during the processing of Okazaki fragments (9Crute J.J. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19266-19270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RNase H activity was initially attributed to a 5′-3′-exonuclease function associated with HSV POL; however, this activity was subsequently attributed to the potent 3′-5′-exonuclease of HSV POL (7Lehman I.R. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28059-28062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In vivo, the extreme COOH terminus of the cognate polymerase has been shown at the molecular level to interact with an accessory factor, UL42, that serves to increase the processivity of the polymerase (10Digard P. Bebrin W.R. Weisshart K. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 398-406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zuccola H.J. Filman D.J. Coen D.M. Hogle J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 267-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). During the predominant rolling circle mode of DNA replication, HSV POL forms a large complex with the viral primase·helicase complex (7Lehman I.R. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28059-28062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the details of which, at a molecular level, have yet to be elucidated. Based on sequence similarity, HSV POL belongs to the POL α family, which includes human polymerase α and polymerases from animals and other viruses. Crystal structures of POL α from thermophilic and archaebacteria and the apo, editing, and replication complexes of the bacteriophage RB69 POL have been reported (12Rodriguez A.C. Park H.W. Mao C.

These structures not only revealed the general architecture of the POL α polymerase but also provide important information on interactions of the enzyme with DNA and nucleotides. Detailed analysis of the HSV POL structure presented here with reference to those previously reported polymerase structures provides valuable insight into the domain functions, conformational changes required for catalysis, and an enhanced understanding of the herpesvirus DNA replication. Further, combined with other experimental data, this analysis enabled us to propose models for the dead-end complex formed with Acyclovir and of a prototype compound of non-nucleotide POL inhibitors, 4-oxo-dihydroquinolines (4-oxo-DHQ). Protein Expression and Purification—A fusion protein consisting of bacterial maltose-binding protein and full-length HSV 1 POL was constructed with either one factor Xa cleavage site at the linker region or with a second factor Xa site right after Asn-42 of HSV POL. The maltose-binding protein-HSV POL fusion protein was expressed in a baculovirus/insect cell system, and cells were harvested 65 h post-infection by slow speed centrifugation. Proteins were resolved by phosphocellulose chromatography, and the pooled fusion protein was cleaved by treatment with endogenous protease (one factor Xa site construct) or by factor Xa (construct with two factor Xa sites). The cleaved product, Asn-42-COOH-terminal, was further purified on a hydroxyapatite column followed by a heparin column. The purified protein was >95% pure as shown via SDS-PAGE and characterized by mass spectrum analysis, amino acid analysis, and NH2-terminal analysis. The purified polymerase proved to be highly active with radioactive nucleotide incorporation assay. Selenomethionine-labeled HSV POL was expressed in the baculovirus insect cell system (17Bellizzi J.J. III Widom Kemp J. Lu C. Das J.Y. Hofmann A.K. Clardy S. L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4573-4578Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Judged by the disappearance of normal methionine, ∼60% of normal methionine was substituted with selenomethionine. Crystallization and Data Collection—Purified protein was concentrated to ∼20 mg/ml in a buffer of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm guanidine HCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 11.1% Me2SO, and 10% glycerol. Crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion against a well buffer of 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mm ammonium sulfate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm guanidine HCl, and 4% polyethylene glycol-3350. For cryoprotection, crystals were transferred into a cryoprotectant buffer of 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 60 mm ammonium sulfate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm guanidine HCl, 10% polyethylene glycol-3350, 11% Me2SO, 10% polyethylene glycol-1000 by slow exchange with mother liquor and soaked in this buffer overnight. For heavy atom soaking, heavy atom compounds were added into cryoprotectant buffer to desired concentrations. Crystals were mounted with cryoloops and cooled immediately into liquid nitrogen afterward. The crystals of HSV POL belong to space group P212121, with typical unit cell dimensions of a = 103.9 Å, b = 125.6 Å, c = 220.6 Å. The diffraction data were collected on beamline 17ID of Advanced Ploton Source at Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL) and processed with the program HKL2000 (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Macromolecular Crystallography. 1997; (Academic Press, New York): 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Further data processing was conducted using program suite CCP4 (19Collaborative Computing Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Molecular replacement attempts with RB69 POL as search model failed to give solutions. Soaking of many different heavy atom compound solutions either destroyed the diffraction or introduced very few specific binding sites, thus very little phase information. The severe non-isomorphism between different crystals also severely limits the usage of multiple isomorphous replacement phasing method. The most promising heavy atom derivative was from crystals soaked in 20 mm trimethyllead acetate overnight: useful anomalous signal could be detected in a two-wavelength data set up to 5.0 Å. At this resolution the model building was impossible despite some secondary structure elements from one of the 3′-5′-exonuclease domains, and one of the palm subdomains could be recognized. The structure of HSV POL was eventually determined using multiple anomalous dispersion method with a crystal formed by selenomethionine-incorporated protein and soaked in 20 mm trimethyllead acetate overnight. The wavelengths were chosen at the absorption edges of selenium and lead, respectively, to maximize the anomalous and dispersive signals (Table 1).

Because selenomethionine incorporation in insect cells is still not very robust (17Bellizzi J.J. III Widom Kemp J. Lu C. Das J.Y. Hofmann A.K. Clardy S. L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4573-4578Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the incorporation level of the protein used in crystallization is ∼50-60%. Of a total of 40 selenomethionine sites 37 were found, along with 14 lead sites. Heavy atom refinement and phase calculations were carried out using the program MLPHARE implemented in CCP4 (19Collaborative Computing Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). The maximum useful phase information is at 3.5 Å. After heavy atom refinement and phase calculations, initial electron density was improved with the program SOLOMON (21Abrahams J.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar), and the quality of the electron density was ready for tracing. A phased rotation and translation search of fragments of known POL structures of the POL α family in the experimentally phased electron density map was used to locate some known domains with the program MOLREP (22Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4098) Google Scholar). Selenomethionine sites were used for sequence registration. A model was built with the program O (23Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). After model building, the initial model was refined against higher resolution native data (Table 1) with the refinement programs CNX (24Brunger A.T. XPLOR Version 3.1. 1992; (Yale University Press, New Haven, CT)Google Scholar) and REFMAC (25Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Cryst. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). In the final model, molecule A starts at 60 and ends at 1197, with peptides 504-513, 640-700, 1036-1066, and 1080-1135 missing. Molecule B starts at 59 and ends at 1197, with peptides 236-240, 641-700, and 1098-1135 missing. Peptide 641-700 is the linking peptide between the NH2-terminal domain and the polymerase domain. Peptide 1198 to the carboxyl end of the molecule (1235) is involved in accessory factor binding (10Digard P. Bebrin W.R. Weisshart K. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 398-406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zuccola H.J. Filman D.J. Coen D.M. Hogle J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 267-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Other missing peptides are all located at the protein surface. Some surface peptides such as NB, NC, P3, P4, and PB (Fig. 1) have very large temperature factors, reflecting their flexibility. To compare protein structures, domain superimposition of HSV POL with other polymerase structures was carried out using the program LSQMAN (26Kleywegt G.J. Zou J.Y. Kjedgaard M. Jones T.A. International Tables for Crystallography. 2001; F (Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands): 353-356Crossref Google Scholar). 4-Oxo-DHQ Binding Assay—Mixtures of HSV POL (100 nm) and/or activated calf thymus DNA (Amersham Biosciences) and/or a 14C-labeled 4-oxo-DHQ (PHA-708620, an analog of PNU-183792) (6Wathen M.W. Rev. Med. Virol. 2002; 12: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were incubated for 5 min and then subjected to rapid filtration by centrifugation (3 min, 14,000 × g) in a Microcon centrifugal concentrator unit (30,000 MWCO, cellulose membrane; Millipore). Aliquots of the resulting filtrate were scintillation counted (Ultima Gold scintillant). Comparison of the quantity of the 4-oxo-DHQ in the filtrate of test samples relative to control samples ([14C]4-oxo-DHQ only) yielded a measure of the amount of bound and free 4-oxo-DHQ. All steps were performed at ambient temperature. The buffer solutions used were either 6.4 mm sodium HEPES, 1 mm Tris-HCl, 11.7 mm KCl, 0.025 mm NaCl, 4.5 or 10 mm MgCl2 (or CaCl2), 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm CHAPS, 4.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 5% Me2SO, 0.046 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 0.001% azide, pH 7.5. The overall architecture of HSV POL closely resembles that of other POL α structures despite being at least 300 amino acid residues longer and exhibiting a low sequence homology (range 16-50%). HSV POL is comprised of 6 structure domains: a pre-NH2 domain, an NH2 domain, a 3′-5′-exonuclease domain, and polymerase palm, fingers, and thumb domains. Based on sequence conservation in the POL α polymerases family (5Gilbert C. Bestman-Smith J. Boivin G. Drug Resistance Update. 2002; 5: 88-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), the exonuclease domain contains conserved regions exo I, exo II (region IV), and exo III (δ-C region). Regions III and VI belong to the fingers, regions I, II, and VII are located in the palm subdomain, and the thumb subdomain contains the conserved region V (Fig. 1A). These domains assemble to form a disk-like shape around a central hole, with the NH2 and COOH termini at opposite sides of the protein (Fig. 1A). Three grooves can be seen emanating from the central hole (Fig. 1B). The first groove, located at the interface of NH2-terminal and exonuclease domains, is lined with positively charged side chains (Fig. 1B). In the RB69 POL replicating complex structure (14Wang J. Sattar A. Wang C.C. Karam J.D. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 1087-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 15Shamoo Y. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 155-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), the analogous groove binds the 5′-extension of the single-stranded DNA template (16Franklin M. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In HSV POL these positively charged side chains are predicted to interact with the phosphate backbone of the single-stranded DNA template. The second groove, located between the exonuclease domain and the tip of the thumb domain, leads to the putative exonuclease active site. In the RB69 POL editing complex structures (14Wang J. Sattar A. Wang C.C. Karam J.D. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 1087-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 15Shamoo Y. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 155-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), the unwound primer strand binds in this groove. The DNA duplex, in both the editing and replicating complex structures, binds to a third groove formed by the palm and thumb subdomains (15Shamoo Y. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 155-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 16Franklin M. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In the HSV POL crystal form there are two molecules in the crystallographic asymmetry unit. Each molecule adopts a slightly different conformation and can be superimposed as two groups. Group 1 consists of the pre-NH2-terminal, NH2-terminal, the exonuclease domain, and the finger domain (root mean square deviation 0.8 A for 595 Cα). Group 2 consists of the palm and thumb domains (root mean square deviation 0.95 A for 300 Cα). Both conformations are close to the open state observed in the apo RB69 POL structure (14Wang J. Sattar A. Wang C.C. Karam J.D. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 1087-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar); however, some conformational differences are observed when either of the two conformations of the HSV POL molecules is compared with RB69 POL and other POL α structures. No consistent concerted motions among different domains are observed when multiple structures are compared. The 3′-5′-exonuclease domain and polymerase palm, fingers, and thumb domains of HSV POL can be individually superimposed with the equivalent domain structures from other POL α structures. In the POL α-conserved regions all the residues of HSV POL can be superimposed with those in RB69 POL. For example, the residues of the secondary structures of the 3′-5′-exonuclease domain, essential for the fidelity of the viral DNA duplication (27Hwang Y.T. Liu B.Y. Hong C.Y. Shillitoe E.J. Hwang C.B.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5326-5332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), can be overlaid with those of RB69 POL, bringing Asp-368, Glu-370, and Asp-471 of HSV POL to Asp-114, Glu-116, and Asp-222 of RB69 POL that form the metal binding site for the nuclease activity (15Shamoo Y. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 155-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Key residues for polymerase catalysis are located on the palm and fingers domains and are superimposable with those of other POL α and will be discussed in the modeling section. In the structures of RB69 POL the thumb domain interacts with the backbone of DNA duplex, and the tip and base of this domain adopt different conformations at the editing and replication modes. Interestingly, the conformation of the thumb domain of HSV POL is similar to that of the replicating conformation of RB69 POL and thus does not require a large conformational change upon DNA binding (Fig. 1B). Sequence conservation in the thumb domain does not need to be high, as DNA duplex binding involves collective interactions; however, high sequence conservation of this domain in the herpes POL family as well as the conserved region V across POL α family does make sense in the context of interacting with DNA duplex backbone (e.g. Arg-959, Arg-1039, His-1051, and Arg-1071). Large deletions or insertions in these domains of the POL α family usually occur at loops or form some additional secondary structures distant from the catalytic centers. HSV POL possesses a 250-amino acid NH2-terminal extension relative to RB69 POL that forms the pre-NH2- and part of the NH2-terminal domains. The pre-NH2-terminal domain is unique to the herpes DNA POL family, and its function is unknown. With the exception of the first 42 residues, which are not present in our construct and are unique to herpes simplex 1 and 2 POL, the sequence similarities of this domain are high among the herpes POL family members. With the exception of two short β strands forming an anti-parallel β sheet, this domain lacks defined secondary structural elements (Fig. 2A) and interacts mainly with the 3′-5′-exonuclease domain located at the surface of the protein. Topologically, the highly conserved FYNPYL sequence at the NH2 terminus of this domain is positioned directly upstream of the putative binding groove for the 5′-extension of the single-stranded DNA template (Fig. 2A), suggesting a possible role for this domain in interacting with the viral primase·helicase complex during leading strand DNA synthesis (7Lehman I.R. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28059-28062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). If confirmed, disruption of these interactions would provide a new path to design anti-herpes drugs. The NH2-terminal domain of HSV POL consists of three motifs. The first motif (141-200 and 299-362) consists of two almost perpendicular β3 sheets (N1, N9 and N11, and N2, N3, N4, N10) plus short α helices NA and NE. The second motif (201-298) is a βαββαβ fold (N5, NC, N6, N7, ND, and N8), and the third (594-639) consists of two helixes separated in primary sequence from the first two motifs by the 3′-5′-exonuclease domain (Fig. 2B). The first motif is conserved within the herpes POL family, but with the NH2-terminal extension it is much larger than the equivalent domain in known α POL structures. The βαββαβ motif is a typical RNA binding motif (RNP) found in ribonucleoproteins (28Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 26: 615-621Crossref Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). The four β strands and two α helices of this motif approximately superimpose with those of human ribonucleoprotein A1 (PDB code 1HA1) with a root mean square deviation of 1.61 for 46 Cα atoms. In the RNP motif, the face of the β sheet above the α helices provides an open platform for RNA binding (28Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 26: 615-621Crossref Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). The analogous face in HSV POL contains a cluster of highly conserved positive charged (Arg-255, Arg-270, and Arg-302) and aromatic (Tyr-204, Tyr-206, and Tyr-293) residues that could interact with the RNA backbone and bases (Fig. 2B). The third motif of this domain has a structure common to others members of the POL α family and consists of two α helices of similar length, NF and NH, connected by a short α helix NG (HSV POL) or a loop. Together with the first and the third motifs of this domain, the putative RNA binding face forms a cleft that would likely accommodate the binding of an RNA or DNA terminus. In support of this, all of the RB69 POL structures contain a guanine nucleotide in this pocket (14Wang J. Sattar A. Wang C.C. Karam J.D. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 1087-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 15Shamoo Y. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 155-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 16Franklin M. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Of a controversial nature are reports that HSV POL possesses an intrinsic 5′-3′-RNase H activity that specifically degrades RNA·DNA heteroduplexes or duplex DNA (7Lehman I.R. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28059-28062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 9Crute J.J. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19266-19270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This activity is required for the excision of the RNA primers that initiate the synthesis of Okazaki fragments at the replication fork during the lagging strand DNA synthesis (7Lehman I.R. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28059-28062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The existence of an RNA binding motif in this domain suggests that this could be the 5′-3′-RNase H catalytic center. Inspection of the HSV POL structure reveals a cluster of residues that could form a metal ion binding site necessary for nuclease activity. In the RB69 POL structures a cluster of highly conserved residues, Glu-294, Asp-306, and Tyr-204, are observed near the phosphate tail of the guanine nucleotide. Topologically, binding of a single strand RNA primer or DNA in this cleft during DNA replication is plausible when one considers that the cleft is on the opposite side of the DNA binding surface (Fig. 1, A and B). Conversely, by analogy with other POL α, the possibility cannot be excluded of the involvement of this domain in the autoregulation of the POL synthesis via binding to its own mRNA (12Rodriguez A.C. Park H.W. Mao C. Beese L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 447-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 13Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Moarefi I. Leighton L. Lasken R. Kuriyan J.

Because of its purported effects and apparently low rate of side effects, ginseng remains one of the top selling natural product remedies in the United States. Given its potential role for improving age-related memory impairments and its common use in China for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease-like symptoms, we analyzed the effects of commercially available preparations of ginseng on the accumulation of the Alzheimer's amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) in a cell-based model system. In this model system, ginseng treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of Abeta in the conditioned medium. We next examined the effects of several compounds isolated from ginseng and found that certain ginsenosides lowered Abeta concentration in a dose-dependent manner with ginsenoside Rg3 having an approximate IC50 of under 25 microM against Abeta42. Furthermore, we found that three of these isolated components, ginsenoside Rg1, Rg3, and RE, resulted in significant reductions in the amount of Abeta detected in the brains of animals after single oral doses of these agents. The results indicate that ginseng itself, or purified ginsenosides, may have similarly useful effects in human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2108938583,"Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) is postulated to play a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We recently proposed a pathway of Abeta-induced toxicity that is APP dependent and involves the facilitation of APP complex formation by Abeta. The APP-dependent component requires cleavage of APP at position 664 in the cytoplasmic domain, presumably by caspases or caspase-like proteases, with release of a potentially cytotoxic C31 peptide. In this study we show that Abeta interacted directly and specifically with membrane-bound APP to facilitate APP homo-oligomerization. Using chimeric APP molecules, this interaction was shown to take place between Abeta and its homologous sequence on APP. Consistent with this finding, we demonstrated that Abeta also facilitated the oligomerization of beta-secretase cleaved APP C-terminal fragment (C99). We found that the YENPTY domain in the APP cytoplasmic tail and contained within C31 is critical for this cell death pathway. Deletion or alanine- scanning mutagenesis through this domain significantly attenuated cell death apparently without affecting either APP dimerization or cleavage at position 664. This indicated that sequences within C31 are required after its release from APP. As the YENPTY domain has been shown to interact with a number of cytosolic adaptor molecules, it is possible that the interaction of APP, especially dimeric forms of APP, with these molecules contribute to cell death."

https://openalex.org/W2138817111,"The disease state of cancer appears late in tumor development. Before being diagnosed, a tumor can remain for prolonged periods of time in a dormant state. Dormant human cancer is commonly defined as a microscopic tumor that does not expand in size and remains asymptomatic. Dormant tumors represent an early stage in tumor development and may therefore be a potential target for nontoxic, antiangiogenic therapy that could prevent tumor recurrence. Here, we characterize an experimental model that recapitulates the clinical dormancy of human tumors in mice. We demonstrate that these microscopic dormant cancers switch to the angiogenic phenotype at a predictable time. We further show that while angiogenic liposarcomas expand rapidly after inoculation of tumor cells in mice, nonangiogenic dormant liposarcomas remain microscopic up to one-third of the normal severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mouse life span, although they contain proliferating tumor cells. Nonangiogenic dormant tumors follow a similar growth pattern in subcutaneous (s.c.) and orthotopic environments. Throughout the dormancy period, development of intratumoral vessels is impaired. In nonangogenic dormant tumors, small clusters of endothelial cells without lumens are observed early after tumor cell inoculation, but the nonangiogenic tumor cannot sustain these vessels, and they disappear within weeks. There is a concomitant decrease in microvessel density, and the nonangiogenic dormant tumor remains harmless to the host. In contrast, microvessel density in tumors increases rapidly after the angiogenic switch and correlates with rapid expansion of tumor mass. Both tumor types cultured in vitro contain fully transformed cells, but only cells from the nonangiogenic human liposarcoma secrete relatively high levels of the angiogenesis inhibitors thrombospondin-1 and TIMP-1. This model suggests that as improved blood or urine molecular biomarkers are developed, the microscopic, nonangiogenic, dormant phase of human cancer may be vulnerable to antiangiogenic therapy years before symptoms, or before anatomical location of a tumor can be detected, by conventional methods."
https://openalex.org/W2166129425,"Macrophages (monocytes/microglia) could play a critical role in central nervous system repair. We have previously found a synchronism between the regression of spontaneous axonal regeneration and the deactivation of macrophages 3-4 wk after a compression-injury of rat spinal cord. To explore whether reactivation of endogenous macrophages might be beneficial for spinal cord repair, we have studied the effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the same paraplegia model and in cell cultures. There was a significant, though transient, improvement of locomotor recovery after a single delayed intraperitoneal injection of 2 microg GM-CSF, which also increased significantly the expression of Cr3 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by macrophages at the lesion site. At longer survival delays, axonal regeneration was significantly enhanced in GM-CSF-treated rats. In vitro, BV2 microglial cells expressed higher levels of BDNF in the presence of GM-CSF and neurons cocultured with microglial cells activated by GM-CSF generated more neurites, an effect blocked by a BDNF antibody. These experiments suggest that GM-CSF could be an interesting treatment option for spinal cord injury and that its beneficial effects might be mediated by BDNF."

Increased expression of 12-lipoxygenase has been documented in a number of carcinomas. When overexpressed in human prostate or breast cancer, 12-lipoxygenase promotes tumor angiogenesis and growth in vivo. The present study was undertaken to delineate the mechanisms by which 12-lipoxygenase enhances angiogenesis.

In addition urinary levels of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), the metabolite produced by 12-LOX, in prostate cancer patients are significantly elevated when compared with normal individuals and removal of the prostate gland results in a significant decrease in the urinary concentration of this eicosanoid (7Nithipatikom K.

Sakr W. Porter A.T. Crissman J.D. Pontes J.E. Powell I.J. Honn K.V. Urology. 1995; 46: 227-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In accordance with these findings, 12-LOX also plays a significant role in tumor cell survival and apoptosis (8Tang D.G. Chen Y.Q. Honn K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5241-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Inhibition of 12-LOX activity in prostate cancer cells results in cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis (9Pidgeon G.P. Kandouz M. Meram A. Honn K.V. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2721-2727PubMed Google Scholar) and overexpression of 12-LOX in PC3 cells leads to an increase in cell survival by the up-regulation of αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins (10Pidgeon G.P. Tang K. Cai Y.L. Piasentin E. Honn K.V. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4258-4267PubMed Google Scholar). Tumor xenografts in mice, generated by the injection of the 12-LOX-overexpressing cells were more angiogenic compared with the tumors formed by the empty vector control cells. These tumors demonstrated a higher microvessel density and these vessels were better organized compared with the controls. Conditioned medium from these cells in culture as well as 12(S)-HETE showed an enhanced capability in stimulating endothelial cell migration compared with medium from vector control cells (11Nie D. Hillman G.G. Geddes T. Tang K. Pierson C. Grignon D.J. Honn K.V. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4047-4051PubMed Google Scholar). The acquisition of the angiogenic phenotype by cancer cells is a pivotal point in the progression and metastasis of solid tumors. Angiogenesis, a complex process involving the formation of new blood vessels from the existing vasculature, is a seminal event in the field of tumor biology (12Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6116) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis is mediated by a complex interplay of a variety of factors which include tumor and endothelial cells, pro-angiogenic factors i.e. vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), proteolytic enzymes, for example MMPs, cell surface molecules, for example integrins and many other factors (13Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (3492) Google Scholar). In addition, anti-angiogenic factors also play a role in regulating blood vessel formation and the balance between the pro- and anti-angiogenic factors determines the rate of formation of the neovasculature. Pro-angiogenic gene expression is activated by a multitude of factors, which include physiological stimuli such as hypoxia, oncogene activation, and tumor suppressor mutations (14Bergers G. Benjamin L.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (2880) Google Scholar). Several experimental observations have proved that VEGF is a potent tumor angiogenesis factor. Agents that target VEGF and its signaling pathways inhibit tumor growth and propagation in various experimental models (15Ferrara N. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The promoter region of the VEGF gene has binding sites for transcription factors like Sp1/Sp3, AP-2, Egr-1, STAT-3, and HIF-1 (16Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 564-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Of these factors, HIF-1 is responsible for transcriptional regulation under hypoxic conditions (17Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3230) Google Scholar). VEGF expression also depends on post-transcriptional mechanisms, chiefly the stabilization of the VEGF mRNA, which is a major event under hypoxia (18Mukhopadhyay D. Datta K. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying the elevated angiogenic response exhibited by 12-LOX-overexpressing PC-3 cells is unknown. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying the enhanced angiogenic response mediated by 12-LOX in prostate tumors. These studies reveal that 12-LOX-overexpressing PC-3 cells secrete high concentrations of VEGF and demonstrate that 12-LOX mediates an increase in VEGF promoter activity and secretion through the Sp-1 and AP2 transcription factors in a PI 3-kinase/Akt-dependent fashion. Our data provide a novel insight into the regulation of angiogenesis by eicosanoids. Plasmids—The VPF/VEGF reporter construct, along with mutant constructs in the region between -88 and -66 of the VEGF promoter, were previously described (19Milanini J. Vinals F. Pouyssegur J. Pages G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18165-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). A LacZ expression construct was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Cell Culture and Generation of Stable Transfectants—PC-3 and Du145 cells were purchased from ATCC maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) in a humidified incubator supplied with 5% CO2 and air at 37 °C. PC-3 cells were plated in 6-well plates and incubated overnight in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were transfected with a platelet-type 12-LOX expression vector (gift from Dr. Colin Funk) or the empty vector (pcDNA 3.1(+)) (Invitrogen), using Geneporter Reagent (Genetherapy Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, cells were placed in selection medium containing G418 (Invitrogen). Clones expressing high levels of 12-LOX were isolated, and the protein levels of 12-LOX-expressing clones, named nL2, nL8, and nL12 were compared with the empty vector control cells (neo) and wild-type PC-3 cells. These cells were characterized in terms of their metabolic activity to produce higher levels of 12(S)-HETE compared with the vector control cells (neo) as described previously (11Nie D. Hillman G.G. Geddes T. Tang K. Pierson C. Grignon D.J. Honn K.V. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4047-4051PubMed Google Scholar). 12-LOX-transfected PC-3 cells (nL2, nL8, and nL12), and vector controls (neo-α, neo-σ, and neo-θ) were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml of G418 (Geneticin). Prior to use cells overexpressing 12-LOX were routinely confirmed for 12-LOX overexpression by Western blot with antisera against 12-LOX (Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, MI). HUVECs were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA), maintained in EGM-2 and used between passage numbers 2 and 9. Assays for Cytokine Measurement—For treatment of cells with inhibitors, 2 × 106 prostate cancer cells were plated in 35-mm wells using 6-well culture plates and cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS. Cells cultured in dishes were treated with various inhibitors as indicated in the text for 24 or 48 h. For each treatment, three wells were used. The culture media were then harvested for determination of VEGF levels or other cytokines using ELISA immunoassay kits from R&D Systems. For treatment of PC-3 cells with 12(S)-HETE, PC-3 cells were cultured in serum-free RPMI 1640 with 0.5% lipid free bovine serum albumin and then treated with escalating concentrations of 12(S)-HETE (Cayman Chemicals) for 48 h before harvesting the culture medium. VEGF165, the secreted predominant VEGF isoform in humans, derived from alternative splicing (20Ferrara N. Gerber H.P. LeCouter J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (7920) Google Scholar), bFGF, and IL-8 were measured in conditioned cell culture medium using ELISA immunoassay kits according to the manufacturer's instruction. Isolation of RNA, Northern Blotting, and Real Time PCR Analyses— Poly(A) mRNAs were isolated from wild-type PC-3, neo-α, neo-σ, nL2, and nL8 cells using an oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For Northern blot analysis, aliquots of poly(A) mRNA (2.5 μg) were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel and transferred to Duralon-UV membranes (Stratagene). The membranes were subjected to UV cross-linking in a Stratagene Crosslinker (Stratagene). The VEGF cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Shin Ohnishi (21Miura H. Miyazaki T. Kuroda M. Oka T. Machinami R. Kodama T. Shibuya M. Makuuchi M. Yazaki Y. Ohnishi S. J. Hepatol. 1997; 27: 854-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Membranes containing the transferred RNAs were prehybridized with QuikHyb solution (Stratagene) at 65 °C for 1 h and then hybridized with denatured [32Pi]VEGF cDNA and salmon sperm DNA at 65 °C for 2 h. Membranes were washed with 2× standard saline citrate (SSC)/0.1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature twice and then rinsed with 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS for 5 min at 65 °C. Radioactivity from the membranes was monitored with a Geiger counter until the background was at low levels, and the wet membranes were wrapped with plastic wrap and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film for 24 h at -80 °C. The membranes were reprobed with the 32P-labeled human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Clontech Laboratory Inc, Palo Alto, CA) as a loading control for mRNA levels in each sample. For Real Time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis, total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol with an additional step of membrane DNase treatment (using an Rnase-free DNase from Qiagen) to remove possible genomic DNA contamination. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the Super-Script III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT)20 primer. For real time detection of target gene expression, TaqMan® Gene Expression assays (Applied Biosystems) were used. PCR was performed using Applied Biosystems 7000 Real-Time PCR System in a total reaction mixture of 25 μl containing 150 ng of cDNA, 1× ABI TaqMan PCR Master mix and 1.25 μl of probe/primers mixture (TaqMan®® Gene Expression assays). After denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles were performed at 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 1 min (universal cycling conditions). Relative quantification was calculated using the comparative CT method also known as the 2-ΔΔCt method (ΔΔCt = ΔCt sample - ΔCt reference) as described previously (22Tai S.K. Tan O.J. Chow V.T. Jin R. Jones J.L. Tan P.H. Jayasurya A. Bay B.H. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 2009-2019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Lower ΔCT values and lower ΔΔCT reflect a relatively higher amount of gene transcript. Transient Transfection to Measure VEGF Promoter Activities—Cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells per 35-mm dish 2 days before transfection with the -1176/+54 VEGF promoter-luciferase construct, or other constructs as indicated, and a LacZ expression plasmid using Gene-Porter transfection reagent following the manufacturer's protocol (Gene Therapy System). Cells were harvested for luciferase assay 36 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). In all co-transfection experiments, transfection efficiency was normalized by assaying β-galactosidase activity using the β-galactosidase assay kit (Invitrogen). Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was used to evaluate the level of 12-LOX protein expression, and phosphorylation of Akt. Semiconfluent (70-80%) cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl 4-fluoride, 0.5 mm leupeptin, 0.15 mm pepstatin A, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and 30-μg protein samples were mixed with 2× SDS sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis in pre-made 4-20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After transfer, the membrane was blocked with TBS-T containing 5% low fat milk for 60 min, incubated with the primary antibody at the appropriate dilution (rabbit anti-Akt and anti-P-473 Ser Akt antibodies 1:1000; rabbit anti-12-LOX, 1:1000; mouse anti-β-actin 1:2500) in TBS-T with 5% low fat milk at 4 °C overnight. Polyclonal antibodies against Akt and phospho-Akt were purchased from Cell Signaling Inc. Monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody was purchased from Chemicon. After overnight incubation with primary antibody, the membrane was washed (3×) with TBS-T and probed with goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugates (1:2000) for 1 h at room temperature and washed (3×) with TBS-T for a total of 15 min. The immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro PI 3-Kinase Assay—In vitro phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositols was carried out with PY20 antibody (Transduction Laboratory) for the detection of immunoprecipitated PI 3-kinase essentially as previously described (23Timar J. Raso E. Dome B. Li L. Grignon D. Nie D. Honn K.V. Hagmann W. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Prostate cancer cells were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm sodium vanadate, 100 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin (lysis buffer). Soluble cell lysates were collected after microcentrifugation at 18,000 × g for 5 min. The protein concentration of cell lysates was adjusted to 0.8-1 μg/μl with lysis buffer and PY20 mAb (5 μg) was added to 500 μl of the cell lysate. The mixture was incubated with gentle rocking at 4 °C overnight, and then 10 mg of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) were added, and the incubation was continued for another 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed (3×) with the aforementioned lysis buffer, twice with 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m LiCl, and 10 μm sodium vanadate, and twice with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm EDTA. Then 50 μl of kinase buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EGTA, 25 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [32P]ATP, 10 μg/sample PtdIns) was added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The assay was terminated by adding 60 μl of 2 μm HCl and 160 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1)/sample, and followed by vortexing and centrifugation. The chloroform phase, which contained the inositides was removed and applied to Silica gel 60 thin layer chromatography (TLC) sheets (Merck). TLC was developed with chloroform/methanol/24% ammonium hydroxide/H2O (90:90:9:19). After drying, spots were located by autoradiography and compared with standards. Endothelial Cell Migration Assay—The migration assay was performed to assess the angiogenic potential of tumor cells using 96-well Chemo-TX invasion plate (Neuroprobe). HUVECs were harvested by trypsinization in the presence of EDTA and suspended in EBM-2 with 2% FBS at density of 5 × 105 cells/ml. To study whether PC-3 cells secrete chemotactic factors which stimulate endothelial cell migration, the conditioned medium from 12-LOX-transfected PC-3 cells and their vector control cells were concentrated (6×) using Centricon-10. The concentrated culture supernatants were then diluted (10×) with EBM-2% FBS and added in the bottom chamber of the well in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against VEGF-A, bFGF, or IL-8. Migration was initiated by adding cells (20 μl) to the upper chamber. After 12-18 h, the cells on the upper side of membrane were removed using Kimwipes, and the plate was fixed and stained. Cells migrated were enumerated in a double blind approach. Usually 5 fields (×100) representing two perpendicular cross-lines of each membrane were counted. For each treatment, at least 6 chambers were used. Reduction of VEGF Expression by 12-LOX Inhibitors—Previous studies clearly have demonstrated that 12-LOX is expressed in prostate carcinoma cells (23Timar J. Raso E. Dome B. Li L. Grignon D. Nie D. Honn K.V. Hagmann W. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and the level of 12-LOX mRNA exhibits a positive correlation with tumor grade and stage (6Gao X. Grignon D.J. Chbihi T. Zacharek A. Chen Y.Q. Sakr W. Porter A.T. Crissman J.D. Pontes J.E. Powell I.J. Honn K.V. Urology. 1995; 46: 227-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In addition, PC-3 cells overexpressing 12-LOX generate highly angiogenic tumors in mice (11Nie D. Hillman G.G. Geddes T. Tang K. Pierson C. Grignon D.J. Honn K.V. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4047-4051PubMed Google Scholar). A similar observation, regarding the proangiogenic role for 12-LOX, also has been demonstrated in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (24Connolly J.M. Rose D.P. Cancer Lett. 1998; 132: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Considering these findings, we examined whether 12-LOX regulates the production of VEGF, a putative angiogenic factor in prostate carcinoma. PC-3 cells were treated with either NDGA (50 μm), a pan-lipoxygense inhibitor or baicalein (10 μm), a specific platelet-type 12-LOX inhibitor for 24 h and the culture medium tested for VEGF protein levels using enzyme immunoassay. As shown in Fig. 1A, both NDGA and baicalein significantly decreased VEGF secretion (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively) whereas a COX inhibitor, indomethacin (50 μm), increased VEGF levels but not at statistically significant levels. The results suggest that 12-LOX may play a role in enhancing VEGF secretion from prostate cancer cells. 12-LOX converts arachidonic acid to 12(S)-HPETE, which is converted to 12(S)-HETE. To study whether 12(S)-HETE can regulate VEGF expression, PC-3 cells were treated with graded levels of 12(S)-HETE, and the protein levels of VEGF in culture medium were assayed by ELISA, normalized to the cell number. As shown in Fig. 1B, 12(S)-HETE treatment stimulated VEGF secretion from PC-3 cells within 48 h of treatment with optimal doses of 300-600 nm. The results suggest that exogenously added 12(S)-HETE regulates the production of VEGF in prostate cancer cells. Increased VEGF Secretion in 12-LOX-overexpressing PC-3 Cells—Previous studies demonstrated that tumors from 12-LOX-overexpressing PC-3 cells have greater angiogenic response compared with the control population (11Nie D. Hillman G.G. Geddes T. Tang K. Pierson C. Grignon D.J. Honn K.V. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4047-4051PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of 12-LOX-mediated enhancement of angiogenesis, we used PC-3 cells stably transfected with the platelet-type 12-LOX expression vector. These 12-LOX-transfected PC-3 cells were found to express higher levels of 12-LOX compared with their vector control (Fig. 2A). The cells were characterized for the presence of higher levels of 12(S)-HETE production as described previously (11Nie D. Hillman G.G. Geddes T. Tang K. Pierson C. Grignon D.J. Honn K.V. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4047-4051PubMed Google Scholar). ELISA for VEGF in the tumor-conditioned medium collected after 24 h of culture, demonstrated a higher secretion of VEGF by the nL8 and nL12 cells compared with empty vector-transfected cells (neo-σ) and wild-type PC-3 cells (Fig. 2B). No significant changes in IL-8 levels were found in culture medium from 12-LOX-transfected PC-3 cells compared with the control cells (Fig. 2C). We also did not detect bFGF in culture medium from PC-3 or any other transfectants (data not shown). These findings suggest a selective modulation of VEGF secretion by 12-LOX in prostate cancer cells. To verify that the observed increase in VEGF secretion is indeed an effect of 12-LOX enzymatic activity, we treated nL8 cells with NDGA (50 μm), baicalein (10 μm), or a COX inhibitor indomethacin (50 μm). Conditioned medium was collected from cells treated with each inhibitor, and the levels of VEGF were assayed by ELISA and normalized to cell number. We observed that NDGA or baicalein decreased VEGF secretion from nL8 cells compared with untreated nL8 cells (Fig. 2D). Also, we observed that indomethacin, a COX inhibitor, did not effect VEGF secretion from nL8 cells (Fig. 2D). The reduction of VEGF secretion in 12-LOX-overexpressing cells upon treatment with inhibitors suggests that the enzymatic activity of 12-LOX is required for VEGF secretion in these cells. These findings provide an explanation for our previous observation (11Nie D. Hillman G.G. Geddes T. Tang K. Pierson C. Grignon D.J. Honn K.V. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4047-4051PubMed Google Scholar) of a higher angiogenic response in tumors formed from 12-LOX-overexpressing cells. Transcriptional Regulation of VEGF Expression by 12-LOX—Regulation of VEGF gene expression occurs at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and/or translational levels (16Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 564-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). To determine whether the increased secretion of VEGF in 12-LOX-overexpressing PC-3 cells results from an increase in the transcriptional rate of the VEGF gene, we performed Northern blot and Real Time PCR analyses of VEGF transcription in these cells. Northern blot analysis revealed a substantial increase in the steady state levels of VEGF mRNA in 12-LOX-transfected PC-3 cells (nL2 and nL8) when compared with the neo vector control cells (Fig. 3). Similarly, RT-PCR analysis also demonstrated that nL8 cells have higher levels of VEGF mRNA compared with the neo cells. The ΔCT values for VEGF mRNA were 8.3 and 9.14 in nL8 and neo cells, respectively, with a p value of 0.035. From these experiments, it is evident that 12-LOX-mediated increase in VEGF secretion involves an increase in the steady state level of VEGF mRNA in the 12-LOX-overexpressing cells. An increase in VEGF mRNA levels may be attributed to either an increase in transcriptional rate or an increase in the stability of the VEGF mRNA (16Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 564-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 18Mukhopadhyay D. Datta K. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Ikeda E. Achen M.G. Breier G. Risau W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19761-19766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) or both. To identify the influence of 12-LOX on the transcription of the VEGF gene, we employed promoter luciferase assays. The p1176-luc vector, a VEGF promoter luciferase vector used in these studies, consists of the VEGF promoter region (-1176/+54) fused upstream of a luciferase gene in a PGL2 vector (19Milanini J. Vinals F. Pouyssegur J. Pages G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18165-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). nL8, nL12, and neo cells were transfected with the p1176-luc vector along with the LacZ plasmid to normalize transfection efficiency. Luciferase assay was performed on the lysed cells, and the values were normalized to β-gal enzyme activity measured using a β-gal assay kit. The assay revealed that there was an ∼10-fold increase in VEGF promoter activity in 12-LOX-overexpressing nL8 and nL12 cells compared with the empty vector control cells and the wild-type PC3 cells (Fig. 4A). These findings suggest that the observed increase in VEGF mRNA levels and secretion is a result of an increased transcriptional activity of the VEGF gene in 12-LOX-transfected PC-3 cells. To further confirm the stimulation of VEGF promoter activity by 12-LOX, we examined whether or not a transient"

However, the regulatory coordination between hypocotyl elongation and cotyledon expansion during early seedling development in plants remains unknown. We report the identification of a Z-box binding factor (ZBF2) and its functional characterization in cryptochrome-mediated blue light signaling. ZBF2 encodes a G-box binding factor (GBF1), which is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor. Our DNA-protein interaction studies reveal that ZBF2/GBF1 also interacts with the Z-box light-responsive element of light-regulated promoters. Genetic analyses of gbf1 mutants and overexpression studies suggest that GBF1 acts as a repressor of blue light-mediated inhibition in hypocotyl elongation, however, it acts as a positive regulator of cotyledon expansion during photomorphogenic growth. Furthermore, whereas GBF1 acts as a positive regulator of lateral root formation, it differentially regulates the expression of light-inducible genes. Taken together, these results demonstrate that GBF1 is a unique transcriptional regulator of photomorphogenesis in blue light.

Taken together, these results demonstrate that GBF1 is a unique transcriptional regulator of photomorphogenesis in blue light. Arabidopsis seedlings are genetically defined to follow two distinct developmental pathways: skotomorphogenesis or etiolation in the dark and photomorphogenesis or de-etiolation in the light (1Deng X.W. Quail P.H. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 2Neff M.M. Fanhauser C. Chory J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 257-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Chen M.

In the dark, seedlings grow with elongated hypocotyls, small and closed cotyledons, and the light-inducible genes are expressed either at low or below detectable levels. The presence of light inhibits hypocotyl elongation, promotes cotyledon opening and expansion, and thus results in photomorphogenesis. The light-inducible genes are expressed at high levels during photomorphogenic growth. Plants are able to perceive various wavelengths of light through photoreceptors.

COP1, a repressor of photomorphogenesis in the dark, acts as an ubiquitin ligase, and it interacts with and mediates the degradation of photomorphogenesis promoting factors such as HY5, HYH, LAF1, and HFR1 in the dark (9Holm M.

Analyses of the promoter sequences of light-inducible genes, including CAB, RBCS, and CHS, have led to identification of at least four commonly found light-responsive elements (LREs): G, GATA, GT1, and Z-box, which have been demonstrated to be essential for light-mediated transcriptional activity (29Ha S.-B.

Plant J. 2002; 31: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Several LRE-specific transacting factors have been identified earlier, and in some cases the genes that encode such factors have been cloned and their functions have been investigated (31Terzaghi W.B. Cashmore A.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 445-474Crossref Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 36Gilmartin P.M. Memelink J. Hiratsuka K. Kay S.A. Chua N.H. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A four-member gene family encoding proteins containing basic leucine zipper DNA binding domains (GBFs) have been reported (37Schindler U. Terzaghi W. Beckmann H. Kadesch T. Cashmore A.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1275-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 38Menkens A.E. Schindler U. Cashmore A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 506-510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Extensive DNA-protein interaction studies were carried out with GBFs. The light-regulated modification and subcellular localization of GBFs have also been investigated. It has been proposed from these studies that the limited nuclear access may be an important controller of the activities of GBFs (39Terzaghi W.B. Bertekap Jr., R.L. Cashmore A.R. Plant J. 1997; 11: 967-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the in vivo functions of these genes are yet to be defined. A Z-DNA-forming sequence (ATACGTGT) is present in CAB1 minimal promoter that is essential for light-dependent developmental expression of CAB1 gene (29Ha S.-B. An G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8017-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that the Z-box containing synthetic and native promoters are responsive to phyA, phyB, and cry1 photoreceptors and are under the control of downstream regulatory components such as COP1 and HY5 (33Puente P. Wei N. Deng X.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3732-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 35Yadav V. Kundu S. Chattopadhyay D. Negi P. Wei N. Deng X.W. Chattopadhyay S. Plant J. 2002; 31: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To identify and clone ZBFs (Z-box binding factors), we have carried out DNA-ligand binding screening to screen an Arabidopsis cDNA expression library and have identified several such factors. One of these ZBFs, ZBF1/MYC2, has very recently been shown to be a negative regulator of blue light-mediated photomorphogenic growth. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that ZBF1/MYC2 acts as a point of cross-talk among light, abscisic acid, and jasmonic acid signaling pathways (11Yadav V. Mallappa C. Gangappa S.N. Bhatia S. Chattopadhyay S. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1953-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 40Boter M. Ruiz-Rivero O. Abdeen A. Prat S.

Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1938-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). We have investigated the functional relevance to light-regulated gene expression and photomorphogenic growth of another ZBF (ZBF2/GBF1) in this study. Plant Materials and Transformations—Surface-sterilized seeds were sown on Murashige and Skoog plates, kept at 4 °C in darkness for 3-5 days, and transferred to light at 22 °C. The intensities of continuous light sources used in this study are: white light (100, 60, 30, 15, 5, and 1 μmol m−2 s−1); blue light (40, 30, 15, 5, and 1 μmol m−2 s−1); red light (95, 30, 15, and 5 μmol m−2 s−1); and far-red light (90, 30, 15, and 5 μmol m−2 s−1). Unless otherwise mentioned, the highest light intensities were used for the experiments. The T-DNA-tagged mutant lines heterozygous or homozygous for the zbf2/gbf1 mutations were identified by genomic PCR analyses. Individual plants of T2 generation, obtained from a self-fertilized heterozygous plant, were examined by genomic PCR using the left border-specific primer LBP: 5′-GCGTGGACCGCTTGCTGCACCT-3′ and GBF1-specific primers LP13: 5′-GTGCCATAAGGCGGCATCATA-3′ and RP13: 5′-TGCAAACAAACACCTTTGCATGT-3′ (for gbf1-1 mutants); and LP14: 5′-GCACCGAACCTTGGATTTCAC-3′ and RP14: 5′-TTCCCATCCCCAGTTGGATCT-3′ (for gbf1-2 mutants). A segregated wild-type (Col) line was used to compare the phenotypic and molecular differences with the gbf1 mutants. For the generation of GBF1/ZBF2 over-expresser transgenic lines, a 1.15-kb fragment of GBF1 cDNA was PCR-amplified using primers 5′-GAAGATCTTGAGTAACACAAGTAAGTAGTAAGC-3′ and 5′-GACTAGTAATCGTAGCTTTTGCAGCTT-3′. The PCR product was digested and cloned into BglII and SpeI site of pCAMBIA1303, a binary vector carrying the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35 S promoter. For the complementation test, a genomic fragment containing full-length GBF1 and ∼1.3 kb upstream DNA sequence was cloned into the SmaI site of pBI101.2 vector. The Agrobacterium strain GV3101 was transformed individually with each recombinant construct. The Arabidopsis wild-type (Ws) plants (for overexpression) or gbf1-1 mutant plants (for complementation) were transformed using Agrobacterium-mediated vacuum infiltration method. Transgenic plants (T1) were screened on 15 μg/ml hygromycin or 20 μg/ml kanamycin containing Murashige and Skoog plates. Several individual lines with a single T-DNA locus, as determined by the segregation of hygromycin- or kanamycin-resistant versus-sensitive ratios (3:1), were selected, and homozygous transgenic plants were generated for further studies. For the generation of gbf1 cry1, gbf1 cry2, and gbf1 phyA double mutants, homozygous gbf1-1 mutant plants (Col) were crossed individually with hy4-2.23N (Ler (4Cashmore A.R. Jarillo J.A. Wu Y.J. Liu D. Science. 1999; 284: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar)), cry2-1 (Col (42Guo H. Yang H. Mockler T.C. Lin C. Science. 1998; 279: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar)), and phyA-101 (RLD (43Parks B.M. Quail P.H. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar)) homozygous mutant lines. F2 seedlings were grown in white light (WL, 60 μmol m−2 s−1) or far-red light (FR, 30 μmol m−2 s−1) for the identification of cry1, cry2, or phyA homozygous lines, respectively, and elongated seedlings were transferred to soil. To determine the genotype at GBF1 locus, ∼40 seedlings from each line were tested by genomic PCR. F3 progeny that are homozygous for gbf1-1 mutant plants were further tested and designated as gbf1 cry1, gbf1 cry2, and gbf1 phyA double mutants. Because gbf1, cry1, cry2, and phyA were of different ecotype backgrounds, F2 seedlings, which were heterozygous for cry1, cry2, or phyA mutations but homozygous wild type for GBF1 were used as control (WT). Transgenic Lines with Promoter-GUS Constructs and GUS Assays—The promoter-reporter constructs used in this study have been described (33Puente P. Wei N. Deng X.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3732-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 35Yadav V. Kundu S. Chattopadhyay D. Negi P. Wei N. Deng X.W. Chattopadhyay S. Plant J. 2002; 31: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). GUS staining (using 20-30 seedlings in each sample) and GUS activity measurements (40-50 seedlings) has been described previously (34Chattopadhyay S. Puente P. Deng X.W. Wei N. Plant J. 1998; 15: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Wild-type and gbf1 mutant plants containing the same transgene were stained for the same length of time. Measurements of Epidermal Cell Length and Expansion—Measurements of epidermal cell length and expansion of 6-day-old seedlings were essentially carried out as described (44Steindler C. Matteucci A. Sessa G. Weimar T. Ohgishi M. Aoyama T. Morelli G. Ruberti I. Development. 1999; 126: 4235-4245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Liu W. Xu Z.H. Luo D. Xue H.W. Plant J. 2003; 36: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift (Gel Shift) Assays—The full-length GBF1 cDNA was cloned in pGEX4T-2 vector, and GST-GBF1 was induced using 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The overexpressed GST-GBF1 was affinity-purified following the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA binding assays were performed as described (13Chattopadhyay S. Ang L.H. Puente P. Deng X.W. Wei N. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The 189-bp DNA fragment of CAB1 minimal promoter was cloned into pBluescript vector after PCR with primers: forward, 5′-CGGAATTCATAAGGATAGAGAGATCTATTC-3′ and reverse, 5′-CGGGATCCTGAGGTTGCTATTGGCTAGTCAT-3′ using genomic DNA as template. The 189-bp fragment was digested with EcoRI plus BamHI, purified, and 3′-end-labeled for using as probe for the DNA binding assays. One nanogram of labeled DNA was used for each binding reactions. Northern and Immunoblot Analyses—Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy plant minikit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instruction. We used a 1.15-kb full-length cDNA fragment of GBF1 for probe preparation using random priming kit (Megaprime™, Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA fragments of CAB, RBCS, and CHS genes were used for probes as described (11Yadav V. Mallappa C. Gangappa S.N. Bhatia S. Chattopadhyay S. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1953-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To quantify the Northern blot data, the intensity of each band was quantified by Fluor-S-MultiImager (Bio-Rad) and ratios of the genes GBF1, CAB, RBCS, or CHS versus its corresponding 18 S rRNA band were determined and plotted. Protein extracts were prepared from wild-type or gbf1 mutant seedlings. 20 μg of total protein was used for immunoblot analysis. Proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. Pre-stained protein markers (Amersham Biosciences) were used for molecular mass determination. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for visualization. For immunoblot analysis, the proteins were transferred to Hybond C-Extra (Amersham Biosciences), blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl) and probed with affinity-purified GBF1 polyclonal antibodies. Chlorophyll and Anthocyanin Measurements—Chlorophyll and anthocyanin contents were measured following essentially the same protocols as described in (9Holm M. Ma L.-G. Qn L.-J. Deng X.W. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Sequence data (GBF1) from this article have been deposited with the EMBL/Gen-Bank™ data libraries under accession number AJ843257. Molecular Cloning of GBF1—We screened a cDNA expression library by DNA-ligand binding screening for the identification of ZBFs. Several genes were identified and cloned from this screen, the products of which showed specific interactions with the Z-box (11Yadav V. Mallappa C. Gangappa S.N. Bhatia S. Chattopadhyay S. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1953-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 35Yadav V. Kundu S. Chattopadhyay D. Negi P. Wei N. Deng X.W. Chattopadhyay S. Plant J. 2002; 31: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We chose one of these genes, ZBF2 (Z-box binding factor 2), which was represented by three independent cDNA clones, for this study. One of the cDNAs of ZBF2 isolated from the ligand binding screen appeared to be a full-length cDNA (At1g36730). It codes for a protein of 315 amino acids with a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA binding domain. The same protein was earlier shown to be interacting with the G-box and designated as GBF1 (37Schindler U. Terzaghi W. Beckmann H. Kadesch T. Cashmore A.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1275-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore, hence onwards we designate this gene as GBF1. GBF1 Interacts with the Z- and G-box LREs of Light-regulated Promoters—To further examine whether GBF1 was able to specifically interact with the Z-box, we purified GST-GBF1 fusion protein from E. coli and performed electrophoretic mobility shift (gel shift) assays using the Z-box DNA as probe. A high affinity DNA-protein complex was detected along with the free probe as shown in Fig. 1A (lane 3). This DNA binding activity of GBF1 was efficiently competed by 50 or 100 molar excess unlabeled Z-box DNA (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 5). Because it was earlier reported that GBF1 could interact with the G-box (Schindler et al. (37Schindler U. Terzaghi W. Beckmann H. Kadesch T. Cashmore A.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1275-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar)), we also competed this binding activity with a consensus G-box (13Chattopadhyay S. Ang L.H. Puente P. Deng X.W. Wei N. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A (lanes 6 and 7), the G-box was able to compete more efficiently this binding activity. Whereas 50 molar excess of Z-box was unable to complete the interaction completely, the unlabeled G-box was able to do so at the same molar excess. However, GT1 failed to compete for the GBF1 binding activity even at 100 m excess (Fig. 1A, lane 8). To further test the relative affinity of GBF1 for the G- and Z-box LREs, we carried out similar experiments using the tetrameric G-box as probe. As shown in Fig. 1B, whereas 50 molar excess of unlabeled Z-box was unable to compete the binding activity completely, the G-box was able to efficiently compete the interaction at the same molar excess (lanes 4-7). In fact, further experiments using various amounts of unlabeled G- or Z-box revealed that, whereas 40 molar excess of unlabeled G-box was able to compete the binding activity, ∼70 molar excess of Z-box was required to compete the binding activity of GBF1 completely (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that GBF1 interacts with the Z- and G-box LREs, and the protein may have slightly more affinity toward the G-box as compare with the Z-box. To further substantiate the interaction of GBF1 with the Z-box, we tested the ability of GBF1 to interact with the Z-box present in native CAB1 minimal promoter. The Z-box present within the minimal promoter region of CAB1 has been shown to be critical for light regulated expression of this gene (29Ha S.-B. An G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8017-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The 189-bp DNA fragment of CAB1 was used for gel shift assays. As shown in Fig. 1C, whereas GST alone did not show any binding activity, a strong low mobility DNA-protein complex was formed with GST-GBF1 fusion protein (lanes 2 and 3). This interaction was efficiently competed out with 80 or 120 molar excess of unlabeled Z-box (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 5) but not with 120 molar excess of GT1 or Zm, a mutated version of the Z-box (Fig. 1C, lanes 6 and 7). Taken together, these results demonstrate that GBF1 specifically binds to the Z-box of native CAB1 minimal promoter. Isolation and Characterization of Null Mutations in GBF1—To investigate the in vivo function of GBF1, we searched for mutants in T-DNA knock-out collections (46Alonso J.M. Stepanova A.N. Leisse T.J. Kim C.J. Chen H. Shinn Stevenson D.K. Zimmerman J. Barajas P. Cheuk R. Gadrinab C. Heller C. Jeske A. Koesema E. Meyers C.C. Parker H. Prednis L. Ansari Y. Choy N. Deen H. Geralt M. Hazari N. Hom E. Karnes M. Mulholland C. Ndubaku R. Schmidt I. Guzman P. Aguilar-Henonin L. Schmid M. Weigel D. Carter D.E. Marchand T. Risseeuw E. Brogden D. Zeko A. Crosby W.L. Berry C.C. Ecker J.R. Science. 2003; 301: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4153) Google Scholar). Two independent mutant lines with T-DNA insertion were identified, and the corresponding alleles were designated as gbf1-1 (zbf2-1) and gbf1-2 (zbf2-2). We performed PCR genotyping analyses to determine plants that are homozygous or heterozygous for gbf1-1 or gbf1-2 mutations. We monitored the segregation of self-fertilized plants heterozygous for gbf1-1 or gbf1-2. The segregation ratios determined by the analyses of genotyping PCR in T2 progeny suggested that a single T-DNA locus was present in each of gbf1-1 or gbf1-2 mutant lines. The junctions of T-DNA and GBF1 were amplified by PCR, and the DNA sequence analyses revealed that the T-DNA was inserted in nucleotide position 80 bp upstream to the start codon of GBF1 in gbf1-1, and in nucleotide position 660 bp downstream to the start codon of GBF1 in gbf1-2 mutants (Fig. 2A). Northern and immunoblot analyses were unable to detect any GBF1 mRNA or protein in gbf1-1 or gbf1-2 mutant backgrounds suggesting that gbf1-1 and gbf1-2 are likely to be null mutants (Fig. 2, B-D). Previous studies revealed that GBF1 mRNA was present in both light and dark grown cotyledons of 5-day-old wild-type seedlings (37Schindler U. Terzaghi W. Beckmann H. Kadesch T. Cashmore A.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1275-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To quantify and expand our understanding about the pattern of expression of GBF1 in wild-type background, we carried out time-course experiments. For these experiments, 5-day-old seedlings grown in constant darkness or WL were transferred to WL or darkness, respectively, for 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 h, and the steady-state mRNA levels were measured. About 3-fold reduction in the expression of GBF1 was detected after 4 h of exposure to WL as compared with dark grown seedlings (Fig. 2E, upper panel and I). In agreement with this observation, the expression of GBF1 was increased to ∼4-fold after 4 h of exposure to darkness as compared with WL grown seedlings (Fig. 2E, upper panel and I). We performed similar time-course experiments to determine whether the level of GBF1 protein was also higher in dark grown seedlings. However, we could not detect any significant change at the protein level during dark to WL transitions or vice versa (Fig. 2E, lower panel). These results suggest that, although the transcript level of GBF1 varies depending on the presence or absence of WL, the protein level remains largely unaltered. Because GBF1 is expressed in WL, we asked whether it was expressed under various wavelengths of light, including far-red light (FR), red light (RL), and blue light (BL). As shown in Fig. 2 (F and J), GBF1 was expressed in all light conditions tested with maximum level of expression in FR. To further examine the light-dependent expression of GBF1, we carried out time-course experiments. For these experiments, 5-day-old seedlings grown in constant WL were transferred to various wavelengths of light for 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 h, and the steady-state mRNA levels of GBF1 were determined. As shown in Fig. 2G, the expression of GBF1 slightly decreased or increased in RL or BL, respectively, however the expression of GBF1 was significantly elevated after 4 h of exposure to FR. The examination of tissue specific expression of GBF1 in adult plants revealed that the gene was expressed in root, stem, and flower at similar levels, however ∼2-fold less expression was detected in the leaf tissues (Fig. 2, H and K). gbf1 Mutants Exhibit Blue Light-specific Morphological Defects in Seedling Development—We monitored the growth of 6-day-old gbf1 mutant seedlings in constant darkness or WL conditions. As shown in Figs. 3A and 4 (A and B), no morphological difference was detected between wild-type and gbf1 mutants grown in constant darkness. However, gbf1 mutants displayed increased sensitivity to WL irradiation under various fluences and therefore, resulted in strikingly shorter hypocotyls as compared with the wild-type seedlings (Figs. 3B, 3C, 3J, and 4A). The effects appeared to be more pronounced within 5-30 μmol m−2 s−1 fluence rates of WL. We asked whether the hypersensitive phenotype of gbf1 was specific to a particular wavelength of light. To address this question, the growth of 6-day-old seedlings under various wavelengths of light was tested. The enhanced inhibition in hypocotyl elong"

Two mammalian pathogens, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and vaccinia virus, exploit Nck as part of their infection strategy. Conflicting data indicate potential differences in the recognition specificities of the SH2 domains of the isoproteins Nck1 (Nckα) and Nck2 (Nckβ and Grb4). We have characterized the binding specificities of both SH2 domains and find them to be essentially indistinguishable. Crystal structures of both domains in complex with phosphopeptides derived from the enteropathogenic E. coli protein Tir concur in identifying highly conserved, specific recognition of the phosphopeptide. Differential peptide recognition can therefore not account for the preference of either Nck in particular signaling pathways. Binding studies using sequentially mutated, high affinity phosphopeptides establish the sequence variability tolerated in peptide recognition. Based on this binding motif, we identify potential new binding partners of Nck1 and Nck2 and confirm this experimentally for the Arf-GAP GIT1.

A high sequence identity (68% overall and 82% for the SH2 domains) and single gene knockouts of Nck1 and Nck2 (1Bladt F. Aippersbach E. Gelkop S. Strasser G.A. Nash P. Tafuri A. Gertler F.B.

Furthermore, Nck1 and Nck2 have both been implicated in the infection process of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) (11Gruenheid S. DeVinney R. Bladt F. Goosney D. Gelkop S. Gish G.D. Pawson T.

EPEC adheres tightly to the membrane of intestinal enterocytes inducing massive remodeling of the microfilament system and suppression of microvilli (13Moon H.W. Whipp S.C. Argenzio R.A. Levine M.M.

This involves the “translocated intimin receptor” (Tir), introduced into the host cell by a type III secretion system (11Gruenheid S. DeVinney R. Bladt F. Goosney D. Gelkop S. Gish G.D. Pawson T.

By recruiting and activating N-WASP and hence the Arp2/3 complex through their SH3 domains (11Gruenheid S. DeVinney R. Bladt F. Goosney D. Gelkop S. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Finlay B.B. Nat.

Following its intracellular replication, the virus is transported to the cell periphery in a microtubule-dependent process (21Rietdorf J. Ploubidou A. Reckmann I. Holmstrom A. Frischknecht F. Zettl M. Zimmermann T. Way M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 992-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), where the viral envelope protein A36R is tyrosine-phosphorylated at Tyr112 recruiting Nck through its SH2 domain. Again, N-WASP/Arp2/3-induced actin polymerization leads to the formation of motile plasma membrane projections beneath the virus (21Rietdorf J. Ploubidou A. Reckmann I. Holmstrom A. Frischknecht F.

Nature. 1999; 401: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated the extent to which the SH2 domains of Nck1 and Nck2 differ in phosphotyrosine signaling. By surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, we identify a Tir-derived phosphopeptide as the strongest natural ligand of both Nck1 and Nck2 SH2 domains. By epitope scan, based on the sequential mutation of the Tir sequence, we derive the optimal peptide profile for both SH2 domains. Furthermore, we present the crystal structure of Nck1-SH2 without ligand and that of both Nck1- and Nck2-SH2 in complex with Tir-derived phosphopeptides. Based on our results, we predict new potential interaction partners for the SH2 domains of Nck1 and Nck2 and demonstrate the tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent interaction for one of these, GIT1. Overall, our analyses do not support distinct phosphotyrosine peptide affinities of the SH2 domains to explain distinguishing characteristics of Nck1 and Nck2. Differences must therefore involve regions outside the peptide-binding groove of the SH2 domains. Production of GST Fusion Proteins—The cDNA for Nck and Grb2 proteins was a kind gift from Michael Way (Cancer Research UK, Lincoln's Inn Fields Laboratories, London, UK) and Ottmar Janssen (Institute of Immunology, Kiel, Germany). Coding sequences of the SH2 domains of human Nck1 (amino acids 281-377) and Nck2 (amino acids 284-380) were amplified by PCR and ligated into the vector pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) using primers 5′-GGTCGGATCCCCTTGGTATTATGGCAAAGTCAC-3′ (5′-primer, BamHI restriction site) and 5′-GGCGCTCGAGTCATGATAAATGCTTGACAAGATA-3′ (3′-primer, XhoI restriction site) for Nck1-SH2, and 5′-GGTCGGATCCGAGTGGTACTACGGGAACGTG-3′ (5′-primer, BamHI restriction site) and 5′-GGCGCTCGAGTCACTGCAGGGCCCTGACGAG-3′ (3′-primer, XhoI restriction site) for Nck2-SH2. GST fusions of Nck and Grb2 SH2 domains were produced in E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus (Stratagene) at 22 °C overnight. Cells were centrifuged, resuspended in 50 ml of PBS, and disrupted by a French press. The supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and washed with PBS. For pulldown assays, PBS plus 10% glycerol allowed snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen. For all other assays, the GST/Nck-SH2 fusion protein was eluted using 10 mm glutathione in PBS (Nck1) or 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl (Nck2) and either used as such in peptide overlay studies or cleaved using PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences). Further purification included Mono Q anion exchange (20 mm citrate buffer, pH 6.0, Nck1) and gel filtration chromatography (20 mm citrate buffer, pH 6, 200 mm NaCl for Nck1 and 20 mm Tris/HCl, 200 mm NaCl for Nck2). Crystallization and Data Collection—Nck1-SH2 was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 4 °C by using 6-10 mg/ml protein in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and 25% PEG5000 MME, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, 0.2 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m guanidine HCl as precipitant. 20% MPD in mother liquor served as cryoprotectant. For co-crystallization, protein and peptide were mixed in a ratio of 1:1.1. Nck1-SH2:Tir12, where Tir12 is a 12-residue, chemically synthesized peptide derived from the EPEC-protein Tir. The complex was crystallized in 2.4 m (NH4)2HPO4, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5; Nck2-SH2/Tir8 in 50% MPD, 15% ethanol, and 0.01 m Na acetate. Diffraction data were collected at 100K at beamlines BL2 (Berliner Elektronenspeicherring-Gesellschaft für Synchrotronstrahlung m.b.

The membrane was blocked by overnight incubation with 10 ml of MBS (2 ml of blocking reagent (Sigma-Genosys), 0.5 g of saccharose, pH 7, and 8 ml of T-TBS (8.0 g/liter NaCl, 0.2 g/liter KCl, 6.1 g/liter Tris base, 0.05% Tween, pH 8.0)). GST-Nck1- or GST-Nck2-SH2 was incubated with the peptide membrane (5 μg/ml in MBS) for 2 h. After a brief T-TBS rinse, the membrane was incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated GST antibody for 1 h. After two washing steps, bound antibody was detected via development with the ECL kit (Roche Applied Science). The experiment was performed in triplicate. Intensity of spots was quantified by luminometry employing a CCD camera (Fuji) and analyzed using AIDA software (Raytest, Germany). Spot intensities of each experiment were normalized by division through the means of positive control intensities (original Tir12-peptides). Normalized intensities were set to percentages (mean of Tir12-peptides: 100%) and averaged over all three experiments. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed using a BIAcore 2000 (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) at 25 °C, and a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Biotinylated decapeptides were passed over and allowed to bind to the surface of a streptavidin-coated sensor chip (SA5, Pharmacia Biosensor). A dilution series of ∼1 mm to 10 nm Nck1- and Nck2-SH2 was prepared in running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20). Protein association and dissociation were each recorded for 2 min for each concentration. The surface was regenerated between injections using 1 m NaCl. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Sensorgrams for each protein concentration were aligned to the same base line after subtraction of the reference. The sensorgram data were quantified by plotting the resonance units at equilibrium (Req) against the protein concentration. The binding constant KD was determined by curve fitting to a 1:1 binding isotherm as shown in Equation 1, Req[Nck]=Rmax·[Nck]KD+[Nck](Eq. 1) where Req indicates the resonance units at equilibrium; KD is the dissociation constant; [Nck] is the molar concentration of Nck, and Rmax is the maximal resonance signal. Pulldown Assays—A431 cells (ATCC, CRL 1555) and HeLa S3 cells (CCl-2.2) were maintained as recommended by the supplier (ATCC, LGC Promochem, Wesel, Germany). 10-cm diameter dishes of 70% confluent cells were serum-deprived for 24 h and treated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence or absence of 2 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 10 min at 37 °C to stimulate protein phosphorylation. Cells were lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (12 mm Tris, 16 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 15 mm KCl, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4) for 10 min on ice and harvested with a cell scraper. The lysate was cleared at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotary wheel with 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose loaded with GST or GST-SH2 fusions of Grb2, Nck1, or Nck2. Precipitates were washed twice, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Anti-GIT1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Binding Affinities of Nck1- and Nck2-SH2 for Target-derived Phosphopeptides—We have determined the binding affinities of the sequentially related SH2 domains of Nck1 and Nck2 (Fig. 1A) for reported binding partner peptides by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy using chemically synthesized phosphopeptides, purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and verified by mass spectrometry. Peptides include those of the exogenous virulence factors Tir (EPEC) and A36R (vaccinia) and the endogenous interaction partners PDGFR, Dab-1, EphrinB1, and EphrinB2. Dab-1 and PDGFR each contain two phosphorylation sites, Tyr220 and Tyr232 for Dab-1, Tyr751 and Tyr1009 for PDGFR, and one for both EphrinB1 and -B2 (Tyr298 and Tyr304). Dissociation constants (KD) for various peptides were determined by analyzing the association and dissociation of Nck1- or Nck2-SH2 at various concentrations to peptide-coated chips (Table 1). With a KD of 60 nm and 370 nm for Nck1 and Nck2, both SH2 domains bind the Tir-derived phosphopeptide with high affinity. This is similar to the 313 nm observed for Nck1-SH2/Tir-phosphopeptide determined in an earlier study using fluorescence polarization (11Gruenheid S. DeVinney R. Bladt F. Goosney D. Gelkop S. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Finlay B.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 856-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). As expected, neither SH2 domain binds to the nonphosphorylated Tir peptide, a negative control. Binding to the A36R-derived peptide is ∼103-fold weaker (KD of 59 μm, 150 μm for Nck1/Nck2) than to the Tir-derived peptide but similar to those for PDGFR Tyr(P)1009 (27 μm/230 μm) and EphrinB1/2 (22 μm/130 μm) peptides. Unexpectedly, binding of Nck1- or Nck2-SH2 to Dab-1 Tyr(P)220 and Tyr(P)232 and PDGFR Tyr(P)751 peptides was not observed, contradicting their identification as Nck1 and Nck2 SH2 ligands. Overall, the isolated Nck2-SH2 displays a slightly weaker affinity (2-9-fold) than Nck1-SH2. Nevertheless, both proteins bind to the same peptides, and the trend in binding affinities is similar. Crystal Structures, Ligand-free SH2 Domain of Nck1—We started to crystallize both domains alone and in complex with tightly binding Tir-derived phosphopeptide to identify potential differences in phosphopeptide binding of Nck1 and Nck2 SH2 domains. The ligand-free structure of Nck1-SH2 at 1.8 Å resolution (Fig. 1B and Table 2) (Protein Data Bank code 2CI8) is broadly similar to that of other SH2 domains (36Bradshaw J.M. Waksman G. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 61: 161-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It consists of a central β-sheet (βB, βC, and βD) flanked by two α-helices (αA and αB). Compared with other SH2 domains, Nck1-SH2 has a second β-sheet (βF′/βF″) near the domain surface, also observed in the recent NMR structure of Nck2-SH2 (37Ran X. Song J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19205-19212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In our crystal, we find that Nck1-SH2 forms a domain-swapped dimer. The loop D′E that connects β-strands D′ and E adopts an extended conformation separating N- and C-terminal halves of the domain and allowing two domains to form a symmetrical dimer. The domain swapped dimeric form of Nck1-SH2 was not detected in solution by gel filtration, dynamic light scattering, and analytical ultracentrifugation, 4S. Frese, W.-D. Schubert, A. C. Findeis, T.

Peptide binding does not significantly affect the conformation of the SH2 domains. A relatively high root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.9 Å for C-α atoms between ligand-free Nck1-SH2 and Tir12-bound Nck1-SH2 is primarily caused by adjustments in the C terminus as well as flexible loops βB-βC, βC-βD, and βF′-βF″ not involved in peptide binding. Similarly, the SH2 domains of peptide-bound Nck1- and Nck2-SH2 are again highly similar despite an r.m.s.d. of 0.7 Å caused by deviations in the loops described above (Fig. 3). Residues involved in phosphopeptide binding are strictly conserved. As a result, interactions between the peptides and the Nck peptide-binding site are mostly equivalent ((Figs. 2C and 3A) corroborating the finding that both SH2 domains prefer the same substrates. Nonconserved residues are confined to loops (Fig. 3B) not involved in phosphopeptide binding. As observed previously for other SH2 domains (36Bradshaw J.M. Waksman G. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 61: 161-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the phosphate group of Tyr(P) is tightly bound in a hydrophilic pocket (Fig. 2). Two conserved arginines (Arg-αA2, Arg-βB5), three serines (Ser-βB7, Ser-βC2, and Ser-βC3) and the amide N of Glu-βC1 ensure tight coordination (Fig. 2C). Apart from the phosphate group, Tyr(P) is also held in position by hydrophobic interactions of the aromatic ring with Lys-βD6 and Arg-αA2 (cation-π interaction and stacking). Other phosphopeptide residues involved in binding include Val+3 (three residues C-terminal of Tyr(P)), Ala+4, Ile-1, and His-2, recognized by specific interactions including salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals interactions. Specific interactions for residues outside the eight central amino acids include a salt bridge of Arg-βF1 to Asp+6 as seen in the complex of Nck1-SH2 with Tir12. Phosphopeptide Residue Profiles Are Virtually Identical for Nck1-SH2 and Nck2-SH2—To establish the contribution of each phosphopeptide residue to the interaction with Nck SH2 domains, we systematically replaced each residue of the peptide (except Tyr(P)) by all 20 standard amino acids (cysteine was chemically protected by an acetamidomethyl group). An epitope scan method was employed to determine the relative binding affinities of Nck1 and Nck2 SH2 domains for these 201 12-residue phosphopeptides. GST-SH2 fusion proteins were allowed to bind to peptides immobilized to a cellulose matrix, and binding affinity was inferred by the signal intensity of each spot after chemiluminescent detection (supplemental Fig. 2A). The experiment was conducted in triplicate, and values for each peptide were averaged following normalization according to the signal derived from the original Tir peptide (red letters or boxes in supplemental Fig. 2, A and B). The peptide scans for Nck1- and Nck2-SH2 are summarized in Fig. 4, A and B. For each position of the phospho"

Here, we show that Sox4 protein is similarly upregulated in ACC by immunohistochemistry of 28 primary cancers and 20 normal tissues. To elucidate the functional significance of these findings, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated RNA silencing was used to downregulate Sox4 expression in the ACC-derived cell line, ACC3. With confirmed knockdown of Sox4 protein, cell viability was reduced by 51%, with a corresponding increase of apoptosis to 85% as compared to 12% in controls. Apoptosis was confirmed by cell morphology, DNA fragmentation and flow cytometry. Cells could be rescued from the proapoptotic effects of Sox4 RNAi by co-transfection with a construct expressing functional Sox4. Microarray gene expression profiling of RNAi knockdown experiments shows that downregulation of Sox4-modulated expression of critical genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle control. Overall, our findings suggest that Sox4 contributes to the malignant phenotype of ACC cells by promoting cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W1973817726,"The short arm of chromosome 8, 8p, is often rearranged in carcinomas, typically showing distal loss by unbalanced translocation. We analysed 8p rearrangements in 48 breast, pancreatic and colon cancer cell lines by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and array comparative genomic hybridization, with a tiling path of 0.2 Mb resolution over 8p12 and 1 Mb resolution over chromosome 8. Selected breast lines (MDA-MB-134, MDA-MB-175, MDA-MB-361, T-47D and ZR-75-1) were analysed further. Most cell lines showed loss of 8p distal to a break that was between 31 Mb (5′ to NRG1) and the centromere, but the translocations were accompanied by variable amplifications, deletions and inversions proximal to this break. The 8p12 translocation in T-47D was flanked by an inversion of 4 Mb, with a 100 kb deletion at the proximal end. The dicentric t(8;11) in ZR-75-1 carries multiple rearrangements including interstitial deletions, a triplicated translocation junction between NRG1 and a fragment of 11q (unconnected to CCND1), and two separate amplifications, of FGFR1 and CCND1 . We conclude that if there is a tumour suppressor gene on 8p it may be near 31 Mb, for example WRN; but the complexity of 8p rearrangements suggests that they target various genes proximal to 31 Mb including NRG1 and the amplicon centred around ZNF703/FLJ14299."
https://openalex.org/W2113800845,"Although lysosomal proteases are expressed in the heart at considerable levels, their specific functions in this organ remain elusive. Mice deficient for the lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L (CTSL) develop a late onset dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) that is characterized by cardiac chamber dilation, fibrosis, and impaired cardiac contraction at 12 month of age. Investigation of the pathogenic sequence of DCM in ctsl-/- mice revealed numerous dysmorphic lysosome-like structures in heart muscle as early as 3 days after birth, whereas skeletal muscle was not affected. Labeling of the acidic cell compartment of neonatal cardiomyocytes and detection of lysosomal markers after subcellular fractionation confirmed increased lysosome content in CTSL deficient myocardium; however, specific storage materials were not detected. The myocardium of ctsl+/+ and ctsl-/- mice revealed no differences in incidence of cell death, proliferation, and capillary density during DCM progression. However, an observed increase in mRNA expression of natriuretic peptides in young adult mice indicates the activation of the adaptive ""fetal"" gene program, while proteome analysis revealed decreased levels of the sarcomere-associated proteins alpha-tropomyosin, desmin, and calsarcin 1, as well as considerable changes of metabolic enzymes. Bioinformatic pathway analysis suggested a switch to anaerobic catabolism and impairment of mitochondrial respiration. This interpretation was supported by a 50% reduction in resting state oxygen consumption and impaired respiration capacity in ctsl-/- myocardial homogenates. In summary, the data indicate an essential role of CTSL in maintaining the structure of the endosomal/lysosomal compartment in cardiomyocytes. Lysosomal impairment in ctsl-/- hearts results in metabolic and sarcomeric alterations that promote DCM development."

We tested whether the secreted protein Slit2, which guides the projection of axons and developing neurons, could modulate brain tumor cell invasion. Slit2 inhibited the invasion of medulloblastoma cells in a variety of in vitro models. The effect of Slit2 was inhibited by the Robo ectodomain. Time-lapse videomicroscopy indicated that Slit2 reduced medulloblastoma invasion rate without affecting cell direction or proliferation. Both medulloblastoma and glioma tumors express Robo1 and Slit2, but only medulloblastoma invasion is inhibited by recombinant Slit2 protein. Downregulation of activated Cdc42 may contribute to this differential response. Our findings reinforce the concept that neurodevelopmental cues such as Slit2 may provide insights into brain tumor invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2118309978,"Gangliosides abundant in the nervous system have been implicated in a broad range of biological functions, including the regulation of cell proliferation and death. Glutamate-induced cell death, which is accompanied by an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is a major contributor to pathological cell death within the nervous system. However, the mechanism underlying this neuronal cell death has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we report that ganglioside GM3 is involved in neuronal cell death. GM3 was up-regulated in the mouse hippocampal cell line HT22 death caused by glutamate. Increment in GM3 levels by both the exogenous addition of GM3 and the overexpression of the GM3 synthase gene induced neuronal cell death. Overexpression of GM3 synthase by microinjecting mRNA into zebrafish embryos resulted in neuronal cell death in the central nervous system (CNS). Conversely, RNA interference-mediated silencing of GM3 synthase rescued glutamate-induced neuronal death, as evidenced by the inhibition of massive ROS production and intracellular calcium ion influx. 12-lipoxygenase (12-lipoxygenase) (12-LOX) was recruited to glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains (GEM) in a GM3-dependent manner during oxidative glutamate toxicity. Our findings suggest that GM3 acts as not only a mediator of oxidative HT22 death by glutamate but also a modulator of in vivo neuronal cell death."

Alzheimer disease is characterized by the presence of β-amyloid plaques, composed predominantly of the Aβ peptide, a 40- or 42-amino acid cleavage product of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP). 3The abbreviations used are: APP, β-amyloid precursor protein; apoE, apolipoprotein E; apoEr2, apoE receptor 2; CTF, C-terminal fragment; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; PTB, phosphotyrosine binding; HA, hemagglutinin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 3The abbreviations used are: APP, β-amyloid precursor protein; apoE, apolipoprotein E; apoEr2, apoE receptor 2; CTF, C-terminal fragment; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; PTB, phosphotyrosine binding; HA, hemagglutinin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. APP, a transmembrane protein, undergoes extracellular cleavage by α- or β-secretase, resulting in the formation of a large N-terminal extracellular fragment (APPs) and smaller, membrane-bound C-terminal fragments (CTF). If the initial cleavage event occurs via β-secretase, then cleavage of the CTF by γ-secretase results in the formation of Aβ (1Hoe H.S. Wessner D. Beffert U. Becker A.G. Matsuoka Y. Rebeck G.W. Mol.

Neurons were seeded on 50 μg/ml poly-d-lysine-coated 12-well tissue culture plates at a density of 2 × 106 cells.Co-immunoprecipitations—Transfected COS7 cells were washed with PBS and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and phosphatase and protease inhibitors. For immunoprecipitations, lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with the anti-HA antibody or an anti-6E10 antibody and protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4-15% polyacrylamide gels, transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk. The blots were incubated with antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were visualized by ECL detection system and exposed to film.Biotin-labeled Cell Surface Proteins—ApoEr2-transfected COS7 cells were washed twice with PBS, and surface proteins were labeled with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) under gentle shaking at 4 °C for 30 min, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quenching solution was added to cells, which were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer, collected with a cell scraper, disrupted by sonication on ice, incubated for 30 min on ice, and clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 2 min). To isolate biotin-labeled proteins, lysate was added to immobilized NeutrAvidin™ gel and incubated 1 h at room temperature. Gels were washed five times with wash buffer and incubated 1 h with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, including 50 mm dithiothreitol. Equal levels of total biotinylated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting.Immunocytochemistry—Primary neuronal cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After fixation, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 5810 and anti-FE65 antibody overnight at 4 °C. After primary incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 555 (red color) goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes) and Alexa Fluor 488 (green color) goat anti-mouse antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Stained cells were viewed with a confocal laser scanning microscope.Live Cell Surface Staining—Human embryonic kidney cells were washed with PBS and incubated with primary antibody diluted in ECS (containing 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose, 15 mm sucrose, 0.25 mg/liter phenol red, and 10 μm d-serine (all from Sigma), adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH) for 8 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times in ECS and then incubated with 5810 antibody (recognizing ApoEr2) for 8 min, washed with ECS, and incubated with Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit antibody for 8 min at room temperature. Final washes were carried out with ECS. Stained cells were imaged on an Axioskop FS microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a ×63, 0.9 N.A., Achroplan, water-immersion objective or with a Nikon E600 microscope equipped with a ×60, 1.0 N.A. objective.Mouse Brains—Brain lysates were prepared from Swiss-Webster mice in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and phosphatase and protease inhibitors). In addition, brains were isolated from 3-month-old male FE65 knock-out mice and controls (C57BL/6 × 129SvEv Bradley) (20Guenette S.Y. Chang Y. Hiesberger T. Richardson J.A. Eckman C.B. Eckman E.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 420-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).Statistical Analyses—Experiments were repeated a minimum of four times unless otherwise noted. All data were analyzed using analysis of variance with Graphpad Prism 4 software, using Tukey's multiple comparison test for post hoc analyses with significance determined as p < 0.05. Descriptive statistics were calculated with StatView 4.1 and displayed as an expressed mean ± S.E.RESULTSFE65 Interacts with APP in COS7 Cells—FE65 interacts with APP and alters APP processing in several cell types. To confirm that APP interacts with FE65 in our system, we transfected COS7 cells with APP and FE65, immunoprecipitated APP with 6E10 antibody, and probed for FE65 with anti-c-Myc antibody. Full-length FE65 co-precipitated with APP (Fig. 1A, upper panel) in cells expressing both APP and FE65. Western blot analysis of COS7 cell extracts confirmed that levels of total APP were consistent across transfections (Fig. 1A, lower panel). We tested whether FE65 affected APP processing in these cells by measuring secreted APP and APP CTF. We transfected COS7 cells with full-length APP; secreted APP was measured in conditioned media, and APP CTF was measured in cell lysates. We found that full-length FE65 strongly increased secreted APP and APP CTF in COS7 cells (Fig. 1B). Because FE65 affects APP processing, we examined whether it affected Aβ production. We found that full-length FE65 significantly decreased secreted Aβ42 levels by 55% in COS7 cells (p < 0.05) (data not shown). Thus, we confirmed that FE65 interacted with APP in COS7 cells and altered its processing.We also asked whether FE65 affected APP processing in CHO cells and whether this processing depended on the apoE receptor LRP. We transfected CHO cells containing or lacking LRP with full-length APP; secreted APP was measured in conditioned media, and APP CTF was measured in cell lysates. In contrast to the findings in COS7 cells, we found that full-length FE65 strongly decreased secreted APP and APP CTF in CHO cells (Fig. 1, C and D). There was little difference between the effects in LRP+/+ and LRP-/- cells (Fig. 1, C and D). An APP immunoblot (middle panel) showed that FE65 did not decrease total APP levels in all transfected cells (Fig. 1, C and D); indeed a slight, nonsignificant increase was observed.FE65 Interacts with ApoEr2 in COS7 Cells—To test whether FE65 interacts with ApoEr2, we transfected COS7 cells with ApoEr2 and FE65, immunoprecipitated ApoEr2 with anti-HA antibody, and probed with anti-c-Myc antibody. Full-length FE65 co-precipitated with ApoEr2 but did not precipitate in the absence of ApoEr2 (Fig. 2A, upper panel). Western blot analysis of COS7 cell extracts confirmed that levels of total ApoEr2 were consistent across transfections (Fig. 2A, lower panel). We also performed the reverse experiment, immunoprecipitating FE65 with anti-Myc antibody, and probing with anti-HA antibody. Full-length ApoEr2 co-precipitated with FE65 but did not precipitate in the absence of FE65 (Fig. 2B). We also tested whether FE65 interacted with ApoEr2 in CHO cells. Full-length FE65 co-precipitated with ApoEr2 in CHO cells (data not shown).FIGURE 2FE65 interacts with ApoEr2 in COS7 cells. A, COS7 cells were transfected with ApoEr2 and FE65 (Myc-tagged) or each construct alone. Cell lysates (200 μg) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-HA, and the precipitate was probed with anti-Myc. ApoEr2 co-precipitated with FE65 in COS7 cells (upper panel, 3rd lane). Lysates from co-transfected cells (20 μg) were probed for ApoEr2 to demonstrate expression (lower panel). B, COS7 cells were transfected with ApoEr2 and FE65 (Myc-tagged) or each construct alone.

We incubated mouse brain lysates with 5810 (α-ApoEr2) and probed the precipitates with FE65 antibody. Immunoprecipitation of ApoEr2 from brain lysates resulted in precipitation of FE65 (Fig. 3A, lane 2). No FE65 was detected in control experiments performed with an irrelevant antibody (α-P-JNK) (Fig. 3A, lane 1). We also incubated mouse brain lysates with α-FE65 and probed the precipitates with 5810. Immunoprecipitation of FE65 from brain lysates resulted in precipitation of ApoEr2 (Fig. 3B, lane 2). As a negative control, the experiment was conducted with an irrelevant antibody (α-P-JNK) (Fig. 3B, lane 1). ApoEr2 and FE65 immunoblots (middle and lower panels) showed that ApoEr2 and FE65 were present in the brain lysates (Fig. 3, A and B); FE65 appeared as an 80-kDa protein, but using another source of molecular weight markers (Invitrogen), it ran as the expected 95-kDa protein.FIGURE 3FE65 interacts with ApoEr2 in brain lysates and primary neuronal cells. A, mouse brain lysates (100 μg) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with antibody 5810 (recognizing ApoEr2) and probed with an anti-FE65 (lane 2). As a negative control, the experiment was conducted with an irrelevant antibody (α-P-JNK) (lane 1). Immunoblot of brain lysates showed similar levels of FE65 and ApoEr2 (middle and lower panels). B, mouse brain lysates (100 μg) were immunoprecipitated with α-FE65 and probed with 5810 (lane 2). As a negative control, the experiment was conducted with an irrelevant antibody (α-P-JNK) (lane 1). Immunoblot of brain lysates showed similar levels of FE65 and ApoEr2 (middle and lower panels). C, primary neuronal proteins (1 mg) were immunoprecipitated with 5810 and probed with α-FE65 (lane 2). As a negative control, the experiment was conducted with an irrelevant antibody (α-P-JNK) (lane 1). ApoEr2 and FE65 co-precipitated.

No ApoEr2 was detected in control experiments with an irrelevant antibody (α-P-JNK) (Fig. 3C, lane 1). Western blot analysis of primary neuronal cells confirmed similar levels of FE65 in the lysates (Fig. 3C, middle panel). We also incubated with α-FE65 and probed the precipitates with 5810. Immunoprecipitation of FE65 from primary neuronal cells resulted in precipitation of ApoEr2 (Fig. 3D, lane 2). As a negative control, the experiment was conducted with an irrelevant antibody (α-P-JNK) (Fig. 3D, lane1). ApoEr2 and FE65 immunoblots (middle and lower panels) showed expression of ApoEr2 and FE65 (Fig. 3, C and D).FE65 Co-localizes with ApoEr2 in Primary Neuronal Cells— To develop an assay for protein clustering, we performed immunocytochemistry on primary neuronal cells. Cells were fixed and immunostained with 5810 (recognizing ApoEr2) and anti-FE65 antibodies. ApoEr2 immunoreactivity was strong in all neurons and was punctate throughout processes (Fig. 4, left panel). Similarly, FE65 was present in cell bodies and expressed in a punctate pattern throughout neuronal processes, but only some of neurons were FE65 positive (Fig. 4, middle panel). ApoEr2 co-localized with FE65 within the neuronal processes and cell bodies (Fig. 4, right panel). Higher magnifications of co-localizations are shown in Fig. 4, lower panels.FIGURE 4Co-localization of ApoEr2 and FE65. After 10 days in culture, primary cortical neurons were fixed and immunostained for 5810 and α-FE65. Antibodies were detected with Alexa Fluor 555 anti-rabbit antibody (in red) (left panel) and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse antibody (in green) (center panel), observed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (×40). Co-localization of ApoEr2 and FE65 appears yellow as vesicular staining in the right panel. Higher magnifications (×100) of neuronal processes are shown in the lower panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ApoEr2 Exon 18 (Containing the NPXY Motif) Interacts with FE65—To determine which domain of ApoEr2 interacts with FE65, we co-transfected COS7 cells with full-length FE65 and ApoEr2 constructs of different C termini with HA tags (Fig. 5A, constructs 1-4). Proteins of expected sizes were expressed to similar levels from each ApoEr2 construct, as determined by Western blots (Fig. 5B). We immunoprecipitated ApoEr2 C termini with the anti-HA antibody and probed for FE65 with anti-c-Myc antibody. FE65 co-precipitated with ApoEr2 constructs possessing exon 18 (constructs 1, 3, and 4) but not the one lacking exon 18 (construct 2) (Fig. 5C). The specificity of the co-precipitation of FE65 with only some ApoEr2 constructs again suggests that the interaction is not due to overexpression of proteins in the same cells. An FE65 immunoblot (Fig. 5C, lower panel) showed that FE65 was expressed to similar levels in all transfected cells.FIGURE 5FE65 interacts with the NPXY motif of ApoEr2. A, constructs of the ApoEr2 cytoplasmic domain with HA tags were generated, including exons 18 and 19 (construct 1), exons 19 and 20 (construct 2), exons 18 and 20 (construct 3), and exons 18-20 (construct 4). B, proteins of expected sizes were expressed to similar levels from each ApoEr2 construct, as determined by Western blots. C, COS7 cells were transfected with different ApoEr2 C-terminal constructs (indicated along the top of the film) and FE65. Cell lysates (200 μg) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-HA antibody and probed with anti-Myc antibody. Only ApoEr2 constructs containing exon 18 immunoprecipitated with FE65. D, COS7 cells were transfected with FE65 and wild-type ApoEr2 (lanes 1 and 3) or an ApoEr2 NPXY to APXY mutant (lanes 2 and 4). Cell lysates (200 μg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and probed with anti-Myc antibody. The ApoEr2 APXY mutant showed decreased co-immunoprecipitation with FE65. ApoEr2 and FE65 immunoblots (middle and lower panels) of cell lysates showed that ApoEr2 was expressed at similar levels in all transfected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test whether the NPXY motif of ApoEr2 was important in the binding of ApoEr2 to FE65, we mutated the NPXY sequence to APXY in a full-length ApoEr2. We transfected COS7 cells with FE65 and wild-type or mutant ApoEr2. ApoEr2 was immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody, and precipitates were probed for FE65 with anti-c-Myc antibody. Mutant ApoEr2 showed significantly less co-precipitation with FE65, to 65% of the level of wild-type ApoEr2 (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5D). The levels of ApoEr2 and FE65 did not vary across conditions (Fig. 5D, middle and lower panels). There was still some interaction observed between ApoEr2 (APXY) and FE65, suggesting that alteration of the asparagine residue was not sufficient to prevent"
https://openalex.org/W2035834978,"Invasion-promoting membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) functions in cancer cells as an oncogene and as a mediator of proteolytic events on the cell surface. To exert its functional activity, MT1-MMP requires proteolytic removal of the prodomain sequence. There are two potential furin cleavage motifs, R89-R-P-R-C93 and R108-R-K-R-Y112, in the prodomain sequence of MT1-MMP. Our data suggest an important role of furin and related proprotein convertases (PCs) in mediating both the activation of MT1-MMP and the levels of functionally active MT1-MMP at the surface of cancer cells. We have determined that the peptide sequence that spans the first cleavage site is susceptible to furin and PC5/6, whereas the second sequence is susceptible to furin and also to PC5/6, PC7 and PACE4. In the structure of the MT1-MMP proenzyme, the R89-R-P-R-C93 site, however, is inaccessible to PCs. Our studies also demonstrated a direct functional link between the activation and the uptake rate of the proenzyme and the enzyme of MT1-MMP. Thus, the uptake rate of the latent MT1-MMP proenzyme noticeably exceeded that of the active enzyme. We conclude that furin and related PCs are the essential components of the specialized cellular machinery that controls the levels of the functionally active, mature, MT1-MMP enzyme on the cell surface to continually support the potency of pericellular proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2065828657,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which mediates biological actions in many physiological processes, is activated by cytokines and growth factors, and has been reported to be constitutively activated in numerous cancer cells. In this study, we examined whether low molecular weight-dual specificity phosphatase two (LMW-DSP2) is involved in the regulation of the interleukin 6 (IL-6)/leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)/STAT3-mediated signaling pathway. IL-6/LIF-induced LMW-DSP2 expression in murine testicular or hepatoma cell lines, while LMW-DSP2 overexpression in 293T cells suppressed IL-6-induced phosphorylation and activation of STAT3. Furthermore, LMW-DSP2 suppressed the expression of IL-6-induced endogenous genes. In contrast, small-interfering RNA-mediated reduction of LMW-DSP2 expression enhanced IL-6-induced STAT3-dependent transcription. In fact, LMW-DSP2 interacted with STAT3 in vivo and endogenous LMW-DSP2 bound to STAT3 in murine testicular GC-1 cells. These results strongly suggest that LMW-DSP2 acts as a negative regulator of the IL-6/LIF/STAT3-mediated signaling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2103510238,"Apomorphine (APO), a potent D1/D2 dopamine receptor agonist, is currently used as an antiparkinsonian drug. We have shown previously that APO stimulates synthesis and release of multiple trophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), in both mesencephalic and striatal neurons, thereby effectively preventing dopaminergic neuron loss in vitro. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of APO on fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) expression and regulation in astrocytes, and furthermore, to identify signaling mechanisms underlying these effects. Here, we show that FGF-2 expression is robustly induced in cultured astrocytes in response to APO. FGF-2 expression was proportional to APO concentration and time-dependent. Conversely, treatment with S-APO, a derivative of R-APO lacking DA receptor agonist activity, did not alter FGF-2 levels. APO treatment resulted in enhanced cytosol FGF-2 immunoreactivity, export of high MW forms of FGF-2 to the cytoplasm from the nucleus and increased extracellular release of FGF-2. Interestingly, both high and low MW forms of FGF-2 were detectable in conditioned medium of APO-treated cultures. This APO-induced effect was correlated with activation of D1 and D2 receptors, as it could be either mimicked by dopamine receptor agonists (SKF38393, quinpirole) or partially blocked by antagonists (SCH23390, SKF83566, haloperidol). Activation of the D1 receptor preferentially increased PKA activity, whereas activation of the D2 receptor only promoted phosphorylation of MAPK. Importantly, APO-modulated FGF-2 expression was independent of Akt/phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling. These data suggest that APO can enhance biosynthesis and release of FGF-2 through activation of dopamine receptors in striatal astrocytes. Both cAMP/PKA and MEK/MAPK signaling cascades are major steps mediating this process."
https://openalex.org/W1970358723,"To analyze mechanisms for cancer metastasis, we established high metastatic sublines from mouse Lewis lung cancer (P29) by repeated injection. Sublines established from the two subclones H7 and C4 commonly exhibited increased proliferation and invasion activity and reduced expression of ganglioside GM1, although they showed different preferences in their target organs of metastasis. The high metastatic sublines secreted higher levels of activated matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-9 as well as pro-MMP-9 in the culture medium than the parent lines. Furthermore, they contained MMP-9 at the glycolipid-enriched microdomain (GEM)/rafts fractionated by the sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation of Triton X-100 extracts, whereas the parent cells showed faint bands at the fraction. When high metastatic sublines were treated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, their invasion activities were dramatically suppressed, and the MMP-9 secretion was also suppressed. All these results indicated that GEM/rafts play crucial roles in the increased invasion and high metastatic potential. To clarify the implication of reduced GM1 expression, low GM1-expressing cell lines were established using an RNA interference-expression vector of the GM1 synthase. Low GM1-expressing cell lines showed increased proliferation and invasion, enrichment in the GEM/rafts, and increased secretion of MMP-9. Among adhesion molecules, only integrin β1 was detected in GEM/rafts with stronger intensity in high metastatic lines and low GM1-expressing cells. Taken together, integrins seemed to be enriched in the GEM/rafts by reduced GM1 levels, and subsequently MMP-9 was recruited to the GEM/rafts, resulting in its efficient secretion and activation, and eventually in the increased invasion and metastatic potentials.

The development of metastasis is a major cause of death in many human cancers. Mechanisms for the acquisition of metastatic potential are, however, not well understood. Cancer metastasis includes many processes, such as invasion into surrounding tissues, release from the primary tumor, intravasation, adhesion to vascular walls, extravasation, and formation of new foci. Consequently, multiple factors are involved in individual steps of metastasis. In the past decade, a number of systems and molecules involved in the metastasis have been identified, and their mutual correlations have also been widely investigated (1Harlozinska A. Anticancer Res. 2005; 25: 3327-3333PubMed Google Scholar). Among them, cell adhesion (2Kannagi R. Glycoconj.

Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5079) Google Scholar). Recently, a number of nonmatrix proteins have also been identified as substrates of these gelatinases, leading to the knowledge on the roles of theses enzymes in many other biological processes (6Bjorklund M. Koivunen E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1755: 37-69PubMed Google Scholar).Microdomains in the cell surface membrane are recognized as particularly important sites in many physiological and pathological cellular events (8Brown D.A.

Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In this study we call them GEM/rafts. Little is known about the roles of GEM/rafts in cancer metastasis to date, although their implications in the cell transformation and oncogenesis have been extensively studied (13Williams T.M. Lisanti M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C494-C506Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar).We established high metastatic sublines from mouse Lewis lung cancer P29 (14Nakanishi H. Oguri K. Yoshida K. Itano N. Takenaga K. Kazama T. Yoshida A. Okayama M. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) by repeated intravenous or subcutaneous injection, and we analyzed cellular changes between the parent cells and the high metastatic sublines with focus on the cell surface molecules. In this study, we found that ganglioside GM1 was specifically down-regulated in high metastatic sublines. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GM1 expression is one of crucial factors to regulate cancer metastatic potential via the modulation of MMP-9 localization and secretion, and to eventually suppress the tumor invasion activity. This study should be the first report on the roles of GM1 in the regulation of metalloproteases in GEM/rafts.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Culture—P29, a low metastatic subline (with subcutaneous inoculation) of the Lewis lung cancer cell line, was subcloned to establish monoclonal sublines H7 and C4. They were repeatedly injected into C57BL/6 mice (intravenous or subcutaneous), and high metastatic sublines were established. These sublines were then maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. GM1 synthase RNAi transfectant (GM1-siRNA) cells and vector control cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 7.5% FBS and puromycin (6 μg/ml) (Calbiochem).Antibodies—Rabbit anti-mouse MMP-9 (AB19047) was purchased from Chemicon International Inc.

GM1 expression was analyzed as described in flow cytometric analysis. Cell surface adhesion molecules were analyzed using rat mAbKMI6 (antimouse integrin β1 chain), hamster mAbHa31/8 (anti-mouse integrin α1 chain), hamster mAbHM2 (anti-mouse integrin α2 chain), rat mAbR1-2 (anti-mouse integrin α4 chain), rat mAb5H10-27 (anti-mouse integrin α5 chain), mAb2H5 (anti-sialyl Lewis x), rat mAbIM7 (anti-mouse CD44), rat mAb281-2 (anti-mouse syndecan-1), and rat mAb KY/8.2 (anti-mouse syndecan-4) from Pharmingen and rat mAb ECCD-2 (anti-mouse E-cadherin) from Takara (Otsu, Japan).Assay of Metastasis—Cells were detached from culture dishes by 5 min of treatment with 0.02% EDTA in PBS, centrifuged, and resuspended in 200 μl of PBS. For the spontaneous metastasis assay, cells (2 × 106/mouse) were inoculated subcutaneously into the thigh of age-matched female C57BL/6 mice (Nippon SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan). Mice were sacrificed at 4 weeks after injection, and metastatic nodules on the surface of lungs were counted by naked eye. The criteria used for the identification of metastatic nodules were as follows: round shape, whitish and uniformly colored, more than 1 mm in diameter, and a different quality of appearance from surrounding normal tissues. Preliminary microscopic examination of tissues had been performed to confirm the identity of metastatic foci compared with the macroscopic observation. For the experimental metastasis assay, cells (1.0 or 0.5 × 106/mouse) were injected into the tail vein of C57BL/6 mice. Mice were sacrificed 3 weeks after injection, and metastatic nodules on the surface of lungs were counted. When mice died before this term, metastatic nodules were counted at death. Metastatic nodules from lungs or other tissues such as ovary and adrenal gland were isolated and cultured to be used for the next injection and/or other functional assays. To examine the effects of MβCD treatment, H7-O cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with or without methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) (10 mg/ml) before injection into the tail vein of mice.MTT Assay—Cells (2 × 103) were seeded into 96-well plates and cultured in DMEM containing 7.5% FBS. Twenty μl of 5 mg/ml MTT (Sigma) in PBS was added to each well. After incubation for 3.5 h at 37 °C, 150 μl of n-propyl alcohol containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 4 mm HCl was added. The color reaction was quantitated using the automatic plate reader Immuno-Mini NJ-2300™ (Nihon InterMed, Tokyo, Japan) at 590 nm with a reference filter of 620 nm.Matrigel Invasion Assay—Cells (0.5 × 106) were suspended in serum-free DMEM and seeded in the upper chamber of Matrigel-coated transwell filters (8 μm pore) (BD Biosciences). The plain medium with or without serum was added to the lower chamber and incubated at 37 °C for 20 h. Noninvading cells remaining on the upper surface of the filter were removed, and the cells that appeared on the lower surface of the filter were fixed with 75% ethanol for 30 min and then stained and counted under a microscope. To examine the effects of MβCD treatment, cells (0.5 × 106) were seeded in upper chambers after being incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with MβCD.Flow Cytometric Analysis—Cell surface expression of gangliosides and adhesion molecules was analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). Cells were incubated with first mAbs for 40 min on ice and then stained with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM or anti-rat IgG or anti-hamster IgG (Cappel, Durham, NC) after being washed. To analyze GM1 expression, cells were incubated with the cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit-biotin conjugates (List Biological Laboratories, Inc., Campbell, CA) for 40 min on ice and then stained with FITC-conjugated avidin (EY Laboratories, San Mateo, CA). Control samples were prepared using the second antibody alone. Intensity of fluorescence was measured and presented in arbitrary units.Gelatin Zymography—Cells (2 × 106) were seeded in 10-cm culture dishes and cultured in DMEM containing 7.5% FBS up to 80% confluency. Cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in serum-free DMEM for another 24 h and then conditioned medium was harvested and concentrated 80-fold with centrifugal filter Amicon Ultra-15™ (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Samples were electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin (Wako, Tokyo, Japan). After electrophoresis, the gel was washed twice in 2.5% Triton X-100 in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) for 30 min to remove SDS. After overnight incubation in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm CaCl2 and 0.02% NaN3 at 37 °C, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid and destained in 20% methanol, 10% acetic acid. Gelatinolytic activity was identified as a clear band on a blue background. The density of the MMP-9 band was measured with a scanner using the NIH image program 1.62 (Bethesda, MD). For MβCD treatment, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with MβCD. Cells were further incubated for 5 or 20 h in plain DMEM, and the supernatants were concentrated.Isolation of Raft Fraction—GEM/rafts were isolated using a detergent extraction method essentially as described by Mitsuda et al. (15Mitsuda T. Furukawa K. Fukumoto S. Miyazaki H. Urano T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11239-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 107/15-cm dish and cultured up to 90% confluency, and five dishes of cells were used for each preparation. After washing twice with ice-cold PBS, the cells were collected, resuspended in 1 ml of MNE/Triton X-100 buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin), and then Dounce-homogenized 15 times. Samples were placed on the bottom of Ultra-Clear™ centrifuge tubes (Beckman Instruments) and mixed with an equal volume of 80% (w/v) sucrose in MNE buffer without Triton X-100. Then 2 ml of 30% sucrose (w/v) in MNE buffer without Triton X-100 was overlaid, and 1 ml of 5% (w/v) sucrose in MNE buffer without Triton X-100 was layered on the top. The samples were centrifuged at 36,000 rpm in an SW50.1 rotor for 16 h at 4 °C. The entire procedure was performed at 4 °C. From the top of the gradient, 0.5 ml of each fraction was collected to yield 10 fractions. For MβCD treatment assay, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with MβCD before the fractionation.Cell Lysis and Immunoblotting—Cells (0.5 × 106) were seeded in 6-cm culture dishes and cultured in DMEM containing 7.5% FBS. Cells were lysed separately in 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF) (Cell Signaling), and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Lysates were separated with SDS-PAGE using 10-15% gels. The separated proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Blots were blocked with in 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (PBST) containing 8% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. The membrane was first probed for 1 h with primary antibodies at the dilution suggested by the suppliers. After washing three times with PBST, the blots were then incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit IgGs or goat anti-mouse IgGs conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling) (1:4000). After the membranes were washed three times with PBST, bound conjugates were visualized with an ECL™ detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For the detection of GM1, the membranes were probed with CTB/biotin (1:200) and detected with an ABC™ kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).Coprecipitation Experiments—Cells (1 × 107) were solubilized in 1 ml of the lysis buffer (Cell Signaling), and the lysates were incubated with 10 μl of anti-integrin β1 (2 μg of IgG) or normal rabbit IgG overnight, and then 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (1:1) (Amersham Biosciences) was added and incubated for 6 h at 4°C. After being washed with immunoprecipitation washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4) four times, the precipitates were solubilized in 40 μl of a Laemmli sample buffer and heated for 3 min at 100 °C. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, as described above.Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed under different conditions, changing temperature and detergent. First, cells were solubilized in the Triton X-100-containing lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) at room temperature, and the lysates were incubated with 10 μl of anti-integrin β1 (2 μg of IgG) or normal rabbit IgG for 2 h at room temperature. Then 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (1:1) (Amersham Biosciences) was added and also incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, washing and electrophoresis were performed as described above. Second, cells were solubilized in another lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4,1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF), and then immunoprecipitation was performed as described under “Cell Lysis and Immunoblotting.”Extraction and Analysis of Gangliosides—Ganglioside extraction was performed as described previously (17Yamashiro S. Ruan S. Furukawa K. Tai T. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5395-5400PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, 1:1, and 1:2, sequentially) and desalted using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters Associates). Acidic glycolipids were separated using DEAE-dextran (A-50) ion exchange chromatography. Ganglioside fractions were analyzed by TLC using a solvent system of chloroform, methanol, 0.2% CaCl2 (55:45:10). For TLC immunostaining, glycolipids were separated by high performance TLC with aluminum sheet silica gel plates (Merck) using a solvent system of chloroform, methanol, 0.2% CaCl2 (55:45: 10, v/v/v). The plates were dipped in isopropyl alcohol, 0.2% CaCl2, methanol (4:20:7, v/v/v), and glycolipids were transferred onto a clear blot membrane-P™ (Atto, Tokyo) using TLC thermal blotter AC-5970™ (Atto, Tokyo). After incubation in PBS with 5% bovine serum albumin, the membranes were probed with CTB/biotin (1:200), and bands were detected with an ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) and immunostained with horseradish peroxidase-1000 kit from Konica (Tokyo, Japan).Expression Vector of RNAi against GM1 Synthase and Transfection—The RNAi expression vectors were constructed using an expression vector pH1-RNApuro (18Takamizawa J. Konishi H. Yanagisawa K. Tomida S. Osada T. Harano T. Yatabe Y. Nagino M. Nimura Y. Mitsudomi T. Takahashi T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3753-3760Crossref PubMed Scopus (2136) Google Scholar), which contained a DNA template for the synthesis of (siRNA). The 21-mer candidate target sequences were selected from the open reading frame of mouse β1,3-galactosyltransferase (B3galt4, GM1 synthase, GenBank™ accession number NM_019420), corresponding to nucleotides 463-483 (relative to the start codon) of B3galt4. The siRNA sequence contained a 5′ BamHI cloning site followed by 21-mer target sequences, a 9-mer spacer, another 21-mer reverse complementary target sequence, the transcription terminator (TTTTT), and the HindIII (3′) cloning site. The full-length of the sequence was 68-nucleotide oligonucleotides, which were synthesized in the forward and reverse directions and annealed to form double-stranded DNA. This double-stranded DNA was cloned into pH1-RNA-puro to form pH1-RNApuro/siB3galt4.For stable transfection of the RNAi expression vector, H7 cells (50-60% confluent) were grown in 6-cm culture dishes, and either 8 μg of pH1-RNApuro/siB3galt4 or pH1-RNApuro alone was introduced using Lipofectamine 2000™ (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, 6 μg/ml of puromycin (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) was added to the culture medium to select puromycin-resistant clones. Two weeks later, independent colonies were picked up, subcultured, and tested for expression of GM1 by flow cytometric analysis with biotin-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit as described above. The selected stable clones with decreased levels of GM1 were maintained in a complete culture medium containing puromycin (6 μg/ml).Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated in Trizol™ (Invitrogen), and template cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). Real time RT-PCR was done using DNA Engine Opticon2™ System (Bio-Rad). cDNA product (8 ng) was amplified in a 20-μl reaction containing 10 μl of DyNAmo™ SYBR Green qPCR kit (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) and 1 μl of each primer (5 mm). The primers for β1,3-Gal-T were 5′-GTCAGCAGCACACAGGGATA-3′ and 5′-CTGGGACGTTGACATACACG-3′, to amplify a 158-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides 751-594 in the open reading frame of the β1, 3-Gal-T gene (GenBank™ accession number NM_019420). The PCR program consisted of an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by amplification with 40 cycles (95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 20 s). Data were analyzed using Opticon Monitor2™ software (Bio-Rad).Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. After blocking with 10% normal goat serum (Chemicon International Inc.) for 30 min, cells were incubated with a mixture of anti-MMP-9 antibody (Ab19047) (10 μg/ml) and CTB-Alexa555 in 10% normal goat serum at 4 °C overnight. After washing, antibody binding was detected with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (MP Biomedicals, Inc. Eschwege, Germany) for 1 h at room temperature. The stained cells were analyzed with a confocal laser microscope Fluoview FV500™ (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance of data were determined using Student's t test.RESULTSEstablishment of High Metastatic Sublines—To establish high metastatic sublines using a low metastatic line of Lewis lung carcinoma (P29), we adopted a consecutive in vivo selection strategy. Before in vivo selection, we established two sublines H7 and C4 from P29 by a limiting dilution method. Then we repeatedly injected H7 or C4 cells into C57BL/6 mice with intravenous or subcutaneous injection. After five rounds of injection (Table 1), metastatic nodules from lung, ovary, adrenal gland, or lymph node were harvested to establish several high metastatic sublines growing in vitro, and they were designated as H7-Lu (lung metastasis of H7 by intravenous), H7-O (ovary metastasis of H7 by intravenous), H7-A (adrenal metastasis of H7 by intravenous), C4-sc (lung metastasis of C4 by subcutaneous), and C4-Ly (lymph node metastasis of C4 by subcutaneous) (Fig. 1A). Malignant properties of high metastatic sublines were analyzed by MTT assay and invasion assay. High metastatic sublines showed higher proliferation and invasion activity than the parent lines (Fig. 1, B and C). High metastatic sublines from C4 showed very high invasion activity when serum was present in the lower chamber.TABLE 1Lung metastatic potentials of P29 cells * indicates p < 0.05 (n = 4); ** indicates p < 0.001 (n = 5), as compared with the values at the first metastatic experiment.CloneRoute of injectionNo. of cells injected (×10–6)IncidenceNo. of foci/lungMeanRangeH7-1aThe first metastatic experimentIntravenous15/54.2 ± 2.52–8H7-5bThe fifth metastatic experimentIntravenous0.55/5153 ± 33.3**98–183H7-1aThe first metastatic experimentSubcutaneous20/400H7-5bThe fifth metastatic experimentSubcutaneous22/40.5 ± 0.60–1C4-1aThe first metastatic experimentIntravenous12/53.8 ± 6.15–14C4-5bThe fifth metastatic experimentIntravenous0.55/5140.2 ± 26.6**106–175C4-1aThe first metastatic experimentSubcutaneous20/400C4-5bThe fifth metastatic experimentSubcutaneous24/43.25 ± 1.7*1–5a The first metastatic experimentb The fifth metastatic experiment Open table in a new tab Expression of Gangliosides and Adhesion Molecules on the Cell Surface Membrane—We examined expression profiles of gangliosides on the cell surface membrane of high metastatic lines and parent lines by flow cytometry (Fig. 2A). Among the gangliosides examined, definite expression of GM1 and GD1a and minimal or low percentage expression of GM2, GA1, GD3, GD2, and GT1b were observed. Expression levels of GM1 markedly decreased in the high metastatic lines (H7-Lu, H7-O, H7-A, C4-sc, and C4-Ly). Expression levels of other gangliosides showed no apparent change compared with those in the individual parent lines.FIGURE 2Expression of gangliosides and adhesion molecules on the cells. Expression of gangliosides (A) and adhesion molecules (B) on the cells was analyzed by flow cytometry using anti-ganglioside mAbs and anti-adhesion molecule antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Ordinate and abscissa represent cell numbers and relative fluorescence intensity, respectively. Thin lines represent samples with first antibodies, and dark shadings represent controls with the second antibody alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of 10 adhesion molecules on the cell surface membrane was also analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2B). In the high metastatic lines, slightly lower expression of integrin subunit α1 was observed, but there were no obvious changes in the expression levels of other antigens between high metastatic lines and the individual parent lines, suggesting that changes in GM1 expression levels might be relevant to the increased metastatic potential.Increased Secretion and Activation Levels of MMP-9 in High Metastatic Lines—The secretion and activation levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9, main proteolytic enzymes for extracellular matrix components, in the culture supernatants were analyzed by gelatin zymography (Fig. 3). Both pro-form and active form of MMP-9 levels were significantly increased in the supernatants of high metastatic lines compared with those of the parent lines, although there were no persistent changes in the expression levels of MMP-2 between the high metastatic and the parent lines. These results suggested that the increased metastatic activities in the high metastatic lines depend mainly on the increased secretion and activity of MMP-9.FIGURE 3Increased MMP-9 secretion and activation levels in high metastatic lines. A, MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretion and activation levels of the cells were determined by gelatin zymography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, bands of pro-MMP-9 and act-MMP-9 in A were quantitated by a scanner, and the relative intensities of the bands were presented. Note that thick bands at 105 kDa were of a proform activated during the gel electro"
https://openalex.org/W2136164908,"Smurf2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that drives degradation of the transforming growth factor-β receptors and other targets. Recognition of the receptors by Smurf2 is accomplished through an intermediary protein, Smad7. Here we have demonstrated that the WW3 domain of Smurf2 can directly bind to the Smad7 polyproline-tyrosine (PY) motif. Of particular interest, the highly conserved WW domain binding site Trp, which interacts with target PY motifs, is a Phe in the Smurf2 WW3 domain. To examine this interaction, the solution structure of the complex between the Smad7 PY motif region (ELESPPPPYSRYPMD) and the Smurf2 WW3 domain was determined. The structure reveals that, in addition to binding the PY motif, the WW3 domain binds six residues C-terminal to the PY motif (PY-tail). Although the Phe in the WW3 domain binding site decreases affinity relative to the canonical Trp, this is balanced by additional interactions between the PY-tail and the β1-strand and β1–β2 loop of the WW3 domain. The interaction between the Smurf2 WW3 domain and the Smad7 PY motif is the first example of PY motif recognition by a WW domain with a Phe substituted for the binding site Trp. This unusual interaction allows the Smurf2 WW3 domain to recognize a subset of PY motif-containing proteins utilizing an expanded surface to provide specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2151237573,"Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) is a rare, inherited genodermatosis characterized by hair follicle hamartomas, kidney tumors and spontaneous pneumothorax. The BHD locus was mapped to chromosome 17p11.2 by linkage analysis, and germline mutations in a novel gene (BHD) were identified in a panel of BHD families. Using RNA interference to decrease expression of the Drosophila BHD homolog (DBHD), we have demonstrated that DBHD is required for male germline stem cell (GSC) maintenance in the fly testis. Reduction of DBHD gene activity suppresses the GSC overproliferation phenotype associated with overexpression of either unpaired (upd) or decapentaplegic (dpp). Further genetic interaction experiments suggest that DBHD regulates GSC maintenance downstream or in parallel of the JAK/STAT and Dpp signal-transduction pathways. These findings suggest that the BHD protein may regulate tumorigenesis through modulating stem cells in human."
https://openalex.org/W2066349981,"The estrogen receptor-α gene (ESR1) was previously identified as a direct target of the homeobox transcription factor BARX2 in MCF7 cells. Here, we show that BARX2 and ESR1 proteins bind to different ESR1 gene promoters and regulate the expression of alternatively spliced mRNAs that encode 66 and 46 kDa ESR1 protein isoforms. BARX2 increases the expression of both ESR1 isoforms; however, it has a greater effect on the 46 kDa isoform, leading to an increased ratio between the 46 and 66 kDa proteins. BARX2 also influences estrogen-dependent processes such as anchorage-independent growth and modulates the expression of the estrogen-responsive genes SOX5, RBM15, Dynein and Mortalin. In addition, BARX2 expression promotes cellular invasion and increases the expression of active matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9). BARX2 also increases the expression of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) genes, TIMP1 and TIMP3, in cooperation with estrogen signaling. Overall, these data indicate that BARX2 and ESR1 may coordinately regulate cell growth, survival and invasion pathways that are critical to breast cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2162084574,"Neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) are characterized by focal regions of demyelination and axonal loss associated with infiltrating T cells. However, the role of activated T cells in causing neuronal injury remains unclear. CD4 and CD8 T cells were isolated from normal donors and polyclonally activated using plate-bound anti-CD3 and soluble anti-CD28. The conditioned T cell supernatants caused toxicity to cultured human fetal neurons, which could be blocked by immunodepleting the supernatants of granzyme B (GrB). Recombinant GrB also caused toxicity in neurons by caspase-dependent pathways but no toxicity was seen in astrocytes. The neurotoxicity was independent of perforin and could not be blocked by mannose-6-phosphate. However, GrB-induced neurotoxicity was sensitive to pertussis toxin, implicating the stimulation of Gialpha protein-coupled receptors. GrB caused a decrease in cAMP levels but only modest increases in intracellular calcium. The effect on intracellular calcium could be markedly potentiated by stromal-derived factor 1alpha. GrB-induced neurotoxicity could also be blocked by vitamin E and a neuroimmunophilin ligand. In conclusion, GrB may be an important mediator of neuronal injury in T cell-mediated neuroinflammatory disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2100206769,"Several studies have shown that the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS-1) and phosphoinositol 4-kinase-β (PI4K-β) regulate the exocytotic process of nerve and neuroendocrine cells. The aim of our study was to investigate their possible interaction at rest and during stimulation in living cells and to decipher the role of this interaction in the secretory process. In PC12 cells, we observed a stimulation-induced recruitment of NCS-1 and PI4K-β from the intracellular compartment toward the plasma membrane. This recruitment was highly correlated to the intracellular Ca2+ rise induced by secretagogues. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer between PI4K-β-ECFP and NCS-1-EYFP, we show that both proteins are interacting in resting cells and that this interaction increases with stimulation. It appears that the membrane insertion of NCS-1 is necessary for the interaction with PI4K-β, since a mutation that prevented the membrane insertion of NCS-1 abolished NCS-1-PI4K-β interaction, as revealed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis. Additionally, the overexpression of mutated NCS-1 prevents the stimulatory effect on secretion induced by PI4K-β, suggesting that the interaction of the two proteins on a membrane compartment is necessary for the secretory function. Moreover, extinction of endogenous PI4K-β by small interfering RNA inhibits secretion and completely prevents the stimulatory effect of NCS-1 on calcium-evoked exocytosis from permeabilized PC12 cells, showing directly for the first time the functional implication of a NCS-1·PI4K-β complex in regulated exocytosis.

Indeed, the C-terminal part of NCS-1 interacts directly with the β subunit of P/Q type voltage-gated calcium channels (5Rousset M. Cens T. Gavarini S. Jeromin A. Charnet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7019-7026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal peptide of NCS-1 inhibited the facilitation current through P/Q calcium channels after NCS-1 injection (4Tsujimoto T. Jeromin A. Saitoh N. Roder J.C. Takahashi T. Science. 2002; 295: 2276-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PI4K-β together with phosphoinositide 5-kinase produces phosphoinositol 4,5-diphosphate (PIP2), which can form phospholipid microdomains (6Eberhard D.A. Cooper C.L. Low M.G.

Besides its effect on calcium channels, NCS-1 has also been shown to regulate PI4K-β activity (2Rajebhosale M. Greenwood S. Vidugiriene J. Jeromin A. Hilfiker S. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3909-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It was first believed that NCS-1 undergoes a Ca2+-induced conformational change, which allows its membrane insertion in secretory granules through its myristoyl residue and the subsequent interaction with PI4K-β (14Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 15Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). However, this model has been recently challenged (16McFerran B.W. Weiss J.L. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol.

The aim of our study was to determine the conditions of NCS-1 and PI4K-β type III interaction in living cells and to correlate this interaction with the secretory function. For this purpose, we used living transfected PC12 cells overexpressing PI4K-β-ECFP and/or NCS-1-EYFP as fusion proteins. A stimulation-induced recruitment of NCS-1 and PI4K-β was observed by biochemical and immunofluorescence approaches as well as by time lapse fluorescence imaging and correlated with the intracellular Ca2+ concentration changes. The interaction between NCS-1 and PI4K-β in PC12 cells was demonstrated through fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between two chromophores and by co-immunoprecipitation. Finally, extinction experiments demonstrated the functional implication of the NCS-1-PI4K-β interaction in dense core secretory granule exocytosis. Materials—Poly-l-ornithine (Mr 30,000–70,000) and the anti-βCOP were from Sigma, and monoclonal anti-NCS-1 antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. Rabbit anti-human PI4K-β type III antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-SNAP-25 antibody was from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Culture medium (RPMI 1640), laminin, nerve growth factor (2.5 S), and horse serum were purchased from Invitrogen. Fetal calf serum was purchased from Dominique Dutscher S.A. (Brumath, France), and type I collagen from rat tail was a product from BD Biosciences. Fura-2-AM was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The transfection reagent (GenePorter) was from Ozyme (St. Quentin/Yvelines, France). Cell Culture and Transfection Procedure—PC12 cells were plated on 35-mm glass bottom plastic Petri dishes (Falcon) coated with collagen and polyornithine (0.1 mg/ml each). They were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing l-glutamine supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum (both decomplemented), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. They were cultivated for 7 days in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. To induce cell differentiation, 2.5 S murine nerve growth factor (50 ng/ml) was added to the culture medium 24 h after plating. For transfection experiments, we used the following constructs. NCS-1-EYFP construct was generated by subcloning the rat NCS-1 cDNA into pEYFP-N1 (Clontech), as previously described (18Scalettar B.A. Rosa P. Taverna E. Francolini M. Tsuboi T. Terakawa S. Koizumi S. Roder J. Jeromin A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2399-2412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the PI4K-β-ECFP construct was generated by subcloning the human PI4K-β cDNA into pECFP-C2 (Clontech), retaining its kinase activity. 4Jean de Barry, A. Janoshazi, J. L. Dupont, O. Procksch, S. Chasserot-Golaz, A. Jeromin, and N. Vitale, unpublished results. After 4 days in culture, 0.5 μg of plasmid of interest was transfected using 5 μl of GenePorter in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 without serum and antibiotics. For co-transfection experiments, 0.5 μg of each plasmid was added to the cells with 10 μl of GenePorter in 1 ml of RPMI 1640. After 4–5 h of incubation, the transfection medium was replaced by full culture medium supplemented with murine nerve growth factor. The cells were used 24–36 h after transfection. Co-transfection efficacy was assessed by spectral fluorescence recording (see below) of single cells. In every co-transfected cell displaying fluorescence, two peaks at 495 and 525 nm were observed. The transfection efficacy for NCS-1-EYFP expression was also compared in monotransfected cells and in co-transfected cells. The fluorescence intensity from single cells (excitation, 460 nm; emission, 525 nm) was 4 times less in co-transfected cells (1090 ± 200; n = 20) than in monotransfected cells (4280 ± 770, n = 20), indicating that co-transfection was effective but affected the level of NCS-1-EYFP expression. For small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments, a bicistronic mammalian expression vector directing the synthesis of GH and siRNAs targeted against PI4K-β was generated essentially as described previously (19Vitale N. Mawet J. Camonis J. Regazzi R. Bader M.-F. Chasserot-Golaz S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29921-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Two cDNA fragments encoding a 19-nucleotide sequence derived from the target transcript and separated from its reverse 19-nucleotide complement by a short spacer were cloned in front of the H1-RNA promoter. The silencers were generated using the following sequences: rat PI4K-β type III (accession number NM_031083) nucleotides 875–893 (active), nucleotides 1869–1887 (inactive), and the active sequence with the first CA bases changed to GG (mutated)). The specificity of the sequence was verified by BLAST search against the gene data bank. To estimate the silencing effect, the plasmids were electroporated (260 V, 1050 microfarads, for 17 ms) in 107 PC12 cells, and 72 h post-transfection, cells were used for Western blot and immunofluorescence experiments. The transfection efficiency under these conditions was measured by counting GH-positive cells after immunofluorescence using an anti-GH antibody (19Vitale N. Mawet J. Camonis J. Regazzi R. Bader M.-F. Chasserot-Golaz S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29921-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and was found to be 60 ± 5%. Immunocytochemistry—We used an isoform-specific anti-PI4K-β antibody (20Godi A. Pertile P. Meyers R. Marra P. Di Tullio G. Iurisci C. Luini A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) and an anti-NCS-1 antibody (4Tsujimoto T. Jeromin A. Saitoh N. Roder J.C. Takahashi T. Science. 2002; 295: 2276-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 13Taverna E. Francolini M. Jeromin A. Hilfiker S. Rosa Roder. J.P. J.

Cultured cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4), for 20 min. After permeabilization for 10 min in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100™, cells were incubated for 1 h in 10% normal goat serum in PBS to block nonspecific binding. This step was followed by 2 h of incubation with primary antibodies in PBS containing 5% normal goat serum at room temperature (anti-PI4K-β, 1:100; anti-NCS-1, 1:100). Goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1000 in 5% goat serum) Alexafluor 488™-conjugated (Molecular Probes) or indocarbocyanine-conjugated (Cy3; Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) was applied for 1 h in PBS. Cultures were finally mounted in Vectashield™ medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) to reduce photobleaching. Controls were obtained by omitting the primary antibody in the incubation bath, and no staining of the cells was observed in these conditions. Immunostaining was performed as described previously (23Vitale N. Chasserot-Golaz S. Bailly Y. Morinaga N. Frohman M.A. Bader M.-F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and stained cells were visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Quantification was performed using the Zeiss CSLM instrument 3.2 software. Regions of interest (ROI) were selected by taking a similar ellipse (6.5 μm2) with the great diagonal (5 μm) at the plasma membrane. Imaging Experiments in Living Cells—PC12 cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in Krebs medium (106 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 11 mm d-glucose, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4, equilibrated with 5% CO2) containing 2 μm Fura-2-AM. Cells were then washed and subsequently incubated for 20 min with Krebs medium. After three washes, the cells were placed on an inverted microscope (Axiovert 35M; Zeiss), superfused with Krebs solution (1 ml/min), and alternatively illuminated at 350 ± 10 nm (for Fura-2) or at 490 ± 10 nm (for EGFP). The fluorescent emission was observed using a dichroic mirror at 500 nm and a long pass filter at 510 nm. For each excitation wavelength (350 nm for Fura-2 and 490 nm for EGFP) and every 2.5 s, an image was recorded using an intensified CCD camera (Extended Isis; Photonic Science) and the Fluostar software (Imstar, Paris, France). Drugs were applied by superfusion in Krebs solution for 1 min. Image Analysis and Semiquantification—Image analysis was performed according to Dupont et al. (22Dupont J.L. Janoshazi A. Bellahcene M. Mykita S. de Barry J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Two image series, each corresponding to one excitation wavelength (350 and 490 nm), were recorded for each experiment. After background subtraction from each image series, another image series was calculated by exponential interpolation to assess for the fluorescence base line during the whole recording period, taking into account probe bleaching and possible probe leaks. This interpolation was performed on a pixel-to-pixel basis between the initial recording period and the final recording period. Finally, a third image series was then calculated, dividing experimental images by interpolated base-line images on a pixel-to-pixel basis. This third set of images was called the normalized image series. The normalized values were independent of fluorescence bleaching and probe concentration heterogeneity in the preparation. Image analysis was performed on a DEC-Alpha work station (Digital Co., Boston, MA) using the Khoros function library (Khoral Research Inc.). On the normalized image series of the Fura-2 fluorescence, the data were then semiquantified by defining regions of interest usually corresponding to entire cells in the microscopic field. The average of the normalized values inside these regions was calculated and plotted versus the image record time. The curves displayed peaks corresponding to stimulation-induced increases in intracellular [Ca2+]. On the normalized image series of the EGFP fluorescence, we defined regions of interest corresponding to the periphery and the center of each fluorescent cell body in the microscopic field. For each cell, the average value of the normalized fluorescence intensity of the outer region was divided by the average value of the corresponding center. This ratio was then plotted versus recording time and revealed the protein translocation during the experiment. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Measurement—For FRET experiments, we used PI4K-β fused with ECFP as a donor and NCS-1 fused with EYFP as an acceptor. PC12 cells monotransfected with plasmids encoding PI4K-β-ECFP or NCS-1-EYFP or co-transfected with both plasmids were placed on an inverted fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 35M; Zeiss; dichroic mirror 470 nm), which was connected by optical fibers with the excitation and the emission monochromators of a spectrofluorimeter (Alphascan, PTI). A single cell was selected in the microscope field. As for imaging experiments, the cells were superfused by Krebs solution (1 ml/min), and drugs were applied by superfusion for 1 min. The cells were illuminated at 430 nm (the excitation wavelength of ECFP), and emission spectra between 480 and 600 nm were recorded every 15 s during the experiment. For FRET measurements, the emission spectra were deconvoluted after base-line subtraction to distinguish donor and acceptor fluorescence intensities. To minimize the bias due to differential expression of the tagged proteins in single cells, donor and acceptor intensities were then normalized by dividing the calculated intensities by the initial measured intensity. These normalized intensities were then plotted versus time. For bleaching resonance energy transfer, the procedure was similar. An initial emission spectrum (excitation 430 nm, the excitation wavelength of ECFP) was recorded, and the preparation was then continuously illuminated at 480 nm (excitation wavelength of EYFP) for 10 min while superfused with Krebs solution. A second emission spectrum (excitation 430 nm) was recorded after illumination. The changes in fluorescence intensities of the donor and the acceptor were calculated after spectral deconvolution. In separate experiments, PC12 cells coexpressing PI4K-β-ECFP and NCS-1-EYFP were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. They were observed on a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP2 AOBS), which allows spectral recording for each pixel of the image. The preparation was excited at 405 nm using a diode laser, and the images were spectrally recorded between 440 and 580 nm. The FRET signal was assessed by calculating the intensity ratio I530/I490. FRET images were generated using the Metamorph software (Universal Imaging). Subcellular Fractionation—PC12 cells were washed twice with Locke's solution and then incubated for 10 min with Locke's solution (Resting) or stimulated for 10 min with an elevated K+ solution. Medium was removed, and cells were immediately scraped in 1 ml of 0.32 m sucrose (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0). Cells were broken in a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 800 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was further centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g to obtain the cytosol (supernatant) and microsomes. The 20,000 × g pellet containing the crude membrane fraction was resuspended in 0.32 m sucrose (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0), layered on a cushion sucrose density gradient (1–1.6 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0), and centrifuged for 90 min at 100,000 × g to separate the plasma membrane from secretory granules (23Vitale N. Chasserot-Golaz S. Bailly Y. Morinaga N. Frohman M.A. Bader M.-F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The upper fractions containing SNAP-25 (plasma membrane marker) and the pellet containing chromogranin A (secretory granule markers) were collected and resuspended in buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2) before protein quantification by Bradford measurements. Immunoprecipitation—Cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells as described previously (19Vitale N. Mawet J. Camonis J. Regazzi R. Bader M.-F. Chasserot-Golaz S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29921-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and 500-μg aliquots were incubated for 24 h at 4 °C with anti-PI4K-β (1:50 dilution). PI4K-β was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant of each sample using protein A-agarose (19Vitale N. Mawet J. Camonis J. Regazzi R. Bader M.-F. Chasserot-Golaz S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29921-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Precipitated proteins were resolved on 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and immunoblotted with anti-PI4K-β (1:1000) and anti-NCS-1 (1:1000) antibodies. Blots were processed using the Western-Light Plus chemiluminescent detection system (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Secretion Measurements—PC12 cells were co-transfected with the plasmids of interest together with pXGH5 encoding human growth hormone using GenePorter. GH release experiments were performed 48 h after transfection (23Vitale N. Chasserot-Golaz S. Bailly Y. Morinaga N. Frohman M.A. Bader M.-F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were washed twice with Locke's solution and incubated for 10 min in Ca2+-free Locke's solution (basal release) or with Locke's solution containing either 59 mm KCl and 85 mm NaCl or 30 μm ATP. The supernatant was collected, and the cells were harvested by scraping in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline. The amount of GH secreted into the medium or present in the cells was measured using a radioimmunoassay kit (Nichols Institute). The amount of GH secretion is expressed as a percentage of total GH present in the cells before stimulation. Localization of PI4K-β and NCS-1—In resting PC12 cells, endogenous PI4K-β immunoreactivity appeared as small patches inside the cytoplasm, and the density of the fluorescence was higher around the nucleus (Fig. 1), probably in the Golgi apparatus, consistent with earlier observations (1McFerran B.

Discrete immunopositive portions of the plasma membrane were also observed, and a careful examination showed that the immunolabel was discontinuous on these portions (Fig. 1A, arrow). In depolarized cells, immunoreactivity appeared further concentrated at the level of the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A). No fluorescence staining of the cells was observed when the primary antibody was omitted, and the distribution pattern of PI4K-β-ECFP was similar to endogenous PI4K-β-immunoreactivity, albeit slightly more fuzzy (see Figs. 2 and 6).FIGURE 2Imaging of NCS-1 and PI4K-β recruitment in KCl-stimulated PC12 cells. A, resting or stimulated PC12 cells expressing either PI4K-β-EGFP or NCS-1-EGFP were fixed and processed for staining with anti-SNAP-25 antibodies. Confocal images in the green (PI4K-β or NCS-1) or red (SNAP-25) were recorded simultaneously in the same optical section by a double exposure procedure. Masks represent the region of colocalization obtained by selecting the double-labeled pixels. Bar, 5 μm. Specific ROI of the plasma membrane were selected (ellipse; see EGFP images).

The micrographs are color-coded according to their normalized fluorescence intensity when illuminated at 490 nm and observed at 520 ± 10 nm. During stimulation with 80 mm KCl for 1 min, both proteins were translocated toward the plasma membrane as revealed by pseudocolor ratio images. This translocation was also revealed by calculating the fluorescence intensity ratio between the outer part of single cells and the corresponding center of the cell body (shown in the graphs). Note that in both cases, the protein translocation during stimulation (solid bars) is transient and that the proteins translocate back to the cytoplasm after stimulus withdrawal (average of five different experiments involving 10–12 cells ± S.E.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6Localization of the FRET signal in resting and stimulated PC12 cells.

The merged images show the colocalization of the two proteins inside the cytoplasm and at the cell periphery (arrows). Pseudocolored FRET efficiency images show a faint FRET signal in resting cells. In stimulated cells, the FRET signal primarily increases in the perinuclear cytoplasm, whereas it seems to decrease at the periphery of the cells (calibration bar, 20 μm). The fluorescence spectrum recorded on the confocal microscope displayed two peaks at 490 and 520 nm, when the preparation was illuminated at 405 nm (continuous line)(C). In cells expressing PI4K-ECFP only a single peak was observed (dotted line)(C). The statistical distribution of the pixel values in FRET signal images shows a single pixel population with low FRET level in resting cells (red columns and dotted line)(D). In stimulated cells (black columns and dashed line)(D), most of the pixels exhibit a high FRET level, but a minor population of low FRET signal pixels is also present.

https://openalex.org/W1982131910,"Stimulus-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Munc18c was investigated as a potential regulatory mechanism by which the Munc18c-Syntaxin 4 complex can be dissociated in response to divergent stimuli in multiple cell types. Use of [(32)P]orthophosphate incorporation, pervanadate treatment, and phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies demonstrated that Munc18c underwent tyrosine phosphorylation. Phosphorylation was apparent under basal conditions, but levels were significantly increased within 5 min of glucose stimulation in MIN6 beta cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Munc18c was also detected in 3T3L1 adipocytes and increased with insulin stimulation, suggesting that this may be a conserved mechanism. Syntaxin 4 binding to Munc18c decreased as Munc18c phosphorylation levels increased in pervanadate-treated cells, suggesting that phosphorylation dissociates the Munc18c-Syntaxin 4 complex. Munc18c phosphorylation was localized to the N-terminal 255 residues. Mutagenesis of one residue in this region, Y219F, significantly increased the affinity of Munc18c for Syntaxin 4, whereas mutation of three other candidate sites was without effect. Moreover, Munc18c-Y219F expression in MIN6 cells functionally inhibited glucose-stimulated SNARE complex formation and insulin granule exocytosis. These data support a novel and conserved mechanism for the dissociation of Munc18c-Syntaxin 4 complexes in a stimulus-dependent manner to facilitate the increase in Syntaxin 4-VAMP2 association and to promote vesicle/granule fusion."

https://openalex.org/W2068847437,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) elicits a potent growth inhibitory effect on many normal cells by binding to specific serine/threonine kinase receptors and activating specific Smad proteins, which regulate the expression of cell cycle genes, including the p21 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor gene. Interestingly, cancer cells are often insensitive to the anti-mitogenic effects of TGF-β for which the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we found that the candidate prostate cancer susceptibility gene ELAC2 potentiates TGF-β/Smad-induced transcriptional responses. ELAC2 associates with activated Smad2; the C-terminal MH2 domain of Smad2 interacts with the N-terminal region of ELAC2. Small interfering siRNA-mediated knock-down of ELAC2 in prostate cells suppressed TGF-β-induced growth arrest. Moreover, ELAC2 was shown to specifically associate with the nuclear Smad2 partner, FAST-1 and to potentiate the interaction of activated Smad2 with transcription factor Sp1. Furthermore, activation of the p21 CDK inhibitor promoter by TGF-β is potentiated by ELAC2. Taken together our data indicate an important transcriptional scaffold function for ELAC2 in TGF-β/Smad signaling mediated growth arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2147814677,"The Ca(v)1.2 L-type Ca2+ channel is the dominant voltage-activated Ca2+ channel in heart and smooth muscle. The functional significance of this channel was studied in intestinal smooth muscle from mice carrying a smooth muscle-specific, conditional inactivation of the Ca(v)1.2 gene (Ca(v)1.2SMACKO mice). Inactivation was complete within 4 wk after tamoxifen treatment and confirmed by RT-PCR, Western blot and functional analysis. Ca(v)1.2SMACKO mice show reduced feces excretion, absence of rhythmic contractions in small and large intestinal muscle and signs of paralytic ileus. Extracellular field stimulation evoked smaller contractions in jejunum muscles from Ca(v)1.2SMACKO than from CTR mice, whereas carbachol-induced contractions of similar magnitude in both muscles. The Ca2+ needed for contraction in jejunum was provided mainly by Ca(v)1.2 channels and by store-operated channels in muscles from CTR and Ca(v)1.2SMACKO mice, respectively. In conclusion, the Ca(v)1.2 channel is essential for electromechanical coupling and important for pharmaco-mechanical coupling in intestinal smooth muscle and cannot be substituted functionally by other Ca2+ entry pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1990657979,"Mutations in the photoreceptor-specific ABCA4 gene are associated with several inherited retinal and macular degenerations. A prominent phenotype of these diseases is the accumulation of cytotoxic lipofuscin fluorophores such as A2E within the retinal pigment epithelium. Another compound, dihydro-N-retinylidene-N-retinylphosphatidyl-ethanolamine (A2PE-H2), also accumulates in retinas of mice and humans harboring ABCA4 mutations and was proposed to be a precursor of A2E. The role of A2PE-H2 in the biogenesis of A2E and its relationship to other retinal fluorophores has not been previously investigated. We report spectral properties and structural relationships of the principal retinal fluorophores that accumulate in retina and retinal pigment epithelium of abca4–/– mice. A long wavelength fluorescence emission intrinsic to abca4–/– retinal explants is shown to emanate from A2PE-H2. All-trans retinal dimer conjugates, which were also identified in the retinal explants, possessed distinct fluorescence and structural properties and, unlike A2PE-H2, did not accumulate in an age-dependent manner. Derivative absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that A2PE-H2, A2E, and N-retinylidene-N-retinyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (A2PE), a known precursor of A2E, share common electronic and resonant structures. Importantly, collision-induced dissociation of A2PE-H2 produced daughter ions that were identical to authentic A2E and its daughter ions. Finally, intravitreal administration of A2PE-H2 to wild-type mice resulted in the formation of A2PE and A2E. These data validate a previously hypothesized biosynthetic pathway for A2E and implicate A2PE-H2 as a precursor in this pathway. Fluorescence properties of A2PE-H2 and other related fluorophores characterized in this report have significance for evaluation of human retinal diseases characterized by aberrant fundus autofluorescence.

Vertebrate photoreceptor cells contain light-sensitive proteins called opsins. Photoreceptor opsins are located in a membranous structure called the photoreceptor outer segment (POS). 4The abbreviations used are: POS, photoreceptor outer segment; A2E, N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine; A2PE, N-retinylidene-N-retinylphosphatidylethanolamine; A2PE-H2, dihydro-N-retinylidene-N-retinylphosphatidylethanolamine; atRAL, all-trans retinaldehyde; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; LC/ESI-MS, liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; N-ret-PE, N-retinylidene phosphatidylethanolamine; ATR dimer-PE, all-trans retinal dimer-phosphatidylethanolamine; ATR dimer-Et, all-trans retinal dimer-ethanolamine; STGD1, Stargardt disease; CID, collision-induced dissociation. The visual chromophore for most vertebrate opsins is 11-cis-retinaldehyde. Absorption of a photon by an opsin pigment induces 11-cis to all-trans isomerization of the retinaldehyde chromophore. Restoration of light sensitivity to the bleached opsin pigment involves chemical reisomerization of the all-trans-retinaldehyde (atRAL) back to 11-cis-retinaldehyde via an enzymatic process called the visual cycle. Most steps of the visual cycle take place within cells of the RPE, a cell layer adjacent to the photoreceptors. Another function of the RPE is to phagocytose the distal tips of POS, which are shed daily by the photoreceptors (1Steinberg R.H. Doc. Ophthalmol. 1985; 60: 327-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 2Bok D. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1993; 17: 189-195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Thompson D.A. Gal A. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2003; 22: 683-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Through these and other functions, the RPE plays an important role in the maintenance of photoreceptor viability. A consequence of the ongoing shedding and phagocytosis of distal POS is the gradual accumulation of fluorescent retinoid, lipid, and protein debris, called lipofuscin, in RPE phagolysosomes (4Feeney-Burns L. Gao C.L. Berman E.R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1988; 29: 708-719PubMed Google Scholar, 5Eldred G.E. Katz M.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 47: 71-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). A major fluorescent constituent of lipofuscin is the bis-retinoid, A2E (6Eldred G.E. Lasky M.R. Nature. 1993; 361: 724-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). At the optical center of the retina is a region called the macula, which contains a high density of rod and cone photoreceptors. The macula subserves fine central vision and is vulnerable to degeneration in multiple inherited and acquired blinding diseases. Several forms of macular degeneration are characterized by excessive accumulation of lipofuscin fluorophores, including A2E, in cells of the RPE. A2E has been shown to be cytotoxic to RPE cells (7Bergmann M. Schutt F. Holz F.G. Kopitz J. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 8Sparrow J.R. Vollmer-Snarr H.R.

Eye Res. 2005; 80: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Stargardt disease (STGD1) is one example of an inherited macular degeneration associated with massive lipofuscin accumulation. STGD1 is caused by mutations in the ABCA4 gene. This gene encodes a photoreceptor-specific transporter called ABCR that helps to eliminate N-retinylidene phosphatidylethanolamine (N-ret-PE) from POS membranes (12Poincelot R.P. Millar P.G.

Subsequent steps in the biogenesis of A2E from N-ret-PE have not been resolved. We previously utilized mice homozygous for a null mutation in the ABCA4 gene to investigate the biosynthesis of A2E (16Weng J. Mata N.L. Azarian S.M. Tzekov R.T. Birch D.G. Travis G.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 17Mata N.L. Tzekov R.T. Liu X. Weng J. Birch D.G. Travis G.H. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Biochemical characterization of abca4–/– mice revealed elevated levels of atRAL and N-ret-PE in retina and A2E in the RPE. Additionally, a 500-nm absorbing species was observed to accumulate within POS in an age-dependent manner (17Mata N.L. Tzekov R.T. Liu X. Weng J. Birch D.G. Travis G.H. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1685-1690PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mata N.L. Weng J. Travis G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7154-7159Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Large amounts of this compound and A2E have also been identified in postmortem retina and RPE samples from STGD1 patients (18Mata N.L. Weng J. Travis G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7154-7159Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Significantly, an acid-mediated conversion of this 500-nm absorbing species to A2E through an oxidized intermediate (A2PE) was observed in vitro (18Mata N.L. Weng J. Travis G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7154-7159Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Based on these data, the compound was believed to be a dihydropyridinium precursor of A2E and was referred to as A2PE-H2; however, the exact chemical structure of this compound has not been solved. Recently, Fishkin et al. (19Fishkin N.E. Sparrow J.R. Allikmets R. Nakanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7091-7096Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) reported the identification of another 500-nm absorbing species in retina and RPE extracts from abca4–/– mice. Structural characterization of this compound showed it to be a dimer of atRAL conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine through a Schiff base linkage (termed ATR dimer-PE) (Fig. 1). Fishkin et al. (19Fishkin N.E. Sparrow J.R. Allikmets R. Nakanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7091-7096Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) suggest that ATR dimer-PE is the sole 500-nm absorbing species in abca4–/– ocular tissues and that A2PE-H2 may not exist. Similarities in the absorbance spectra of ATR dimer-PE and the compound previously identified as A2PE-H2, as well as the observation that ATR dimer conjugates rearrange to A2E under acidic conditions in vitro (19Fishkin N.E. Sparrow J.R. Allikmets R. Nakanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7091-7096Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), tend to support this contention. In this report, the relationship of dominant retinal fluorophores that accumulate in abca4–/– mice and their role in A2E biosynthesis in vivo has been examined. We show that in addition to ATR dimer conjugates, abca4–/– ocular tissues contain a second 500-nm absorbing species. Significant similarity in the electronic structure and chemical composition of this species with A2PE and A2E has been observed. These features are not shared by ATR dimer conjugates. In addition, this compound serves as a precursor to A2E in vivo. Based on these findings, we suggest that this compound is identical to the previously proposed A2PE-H2. Mice—Retinal tissue explants were dissected from abca4–/– (B6 × 129 hybrid) mice and age-matched, wild-type (C57BL/6) mice. Mice were maintained at 30–50 lux in a vivarium facility under 12-h cyclic light and were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (200 mg/kg) plus xylazine (10 mg/kg) before death by cervical dislocation. For the A2PE-H2 treatment study, A2PE-H2 (∼5 nmol by phosphorus content) was resuspended in a solution containing 0.2 mg/ml dioleoyl phosphatidyl-choline/dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (60: 40, v/v) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2 (final volume ∼0.2 ml). The solution was gently sonicated, and 2 μl was administered to anesthetized wild-type (BALB/c) mice by intravitreal injection. Six injections were given over a 12-day period. Mice were aged 1.5 months at study onset and were kept under 12-h cyclic light at 30 lux for 28 days following the final injection. Tissue Preparation and Extraction—Chloroform-soluble compounds were extracted from retinal tissues as described previously (17Mata N.L. Tzekov R.T. Liu X. Weng J. Birch D.G. Travis G.H. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1685-1690PubMed Google Scholar). The extracts were washed with 4 ml of distilled H2O/methanol (1:1, v/v), and the organic phase was then taken to dryness under a stream of N2. Sample residues were dissolved in 200 μl of 2-propanol for analysis by HPLC. All manipulations were done on ice under dim red light (Kodak Wratten 1A). HPLC—Phospholipid extracts and synthetic retinal fluorophores were analyzed/purified by normal phase HPLC on a silica column (Zorbax Rx-Sil 5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm, Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) using an Agilent model 1100 liquid chromatograph equipped with photodiode array and fluorescence detectors (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE). The mobile phase (hexane/2-propanol/ethanol/25 mm potassium phosphate/acetic acid, 485:376:100:37:0.275, v/v) was pumped through the system at 1 ml/min. Column and solvent temperatures were maintained at 40 °C. Liquid Chromatography/Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS)—Samples were analyzed by reverse-phase chromatography on a C18 column (Zorbax 300 SB-C18; 5 μm, 250 × 0.5 mm, Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) using an Agilent 1100 series capillary liquid chromatograph equipped with a photodiode array detector. The column was equilibrated with 25% methanol/75% chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). A linear gradient to 100% chloroform/methanol was initiated 5 min after sample injection. Total run time was 25 min. Flow rate was 10 μl/min, and column temperature was maintained at 40 °C. The LC was coupled to an LCQ Deca XP ion-trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). MS conditions were as follows: electrospray ionization = 5.0 kV; N2 gas flow = 20 units; capillary voltage = 15 V; tube lens offset = 46 V; capillary temperature = 225 °C. Helium collision energy was varied between 35 and 45% to optimize fragmentation of the desired ions. Synthesis and Analysis of A2E, A2PE, and ATR Dimer Conjugates—A2E and A2PE were synthesized as described previously (37Parish C.A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. Dillon J. Sparrow J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14609-14613Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). ATR dimer and ATR dimer-ethanolamine conjugate (ATR dimer-Et) were synthesized and purified according to published methods (19Fishkin N.E. Sparrow J.R. Allikmets R. Nakanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7091-7096Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A2E and A2PE were purified using normal phase HPLC as described above. ATR dimer-Et was purified on the same system except that the mobile phase was replaced with a gradient of 10% dioxane in n-hexane (16Weng J. Mata N.L. Azarian S.M. Tzekov R.T. Birch D.G. Travis G.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Quantitation of the purified compounds and comparison of ATR dimer-Et to native A2PE-H2 were achieved by UV-visible absorbance spectroscopy using a Shimadzu UV-2401 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu/Cole Scientific, Moorpark, CA). Successful synthesis of unprotonated ATR dimer-Et was confirmed by mass spectroscopy and by demonstration of a bathochromic shift following treatment with acetic acid (final [HAc] = 0.1 n in methanol). Fluorescence Spectroscopy of Retinal Explants—Fluorescence emission spectra from RPE-choroid and retina explants were acquired using a Tecan Safire II fluorescence microplate reader (Tecan US, Research Triangle Park, NC). Briefly, dissected tissue samples were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) and placed anterior side up in a modified 384-well microplate. Emission spectra were measured following excitation at 420 nm using top read mode. The z axis of the optical unit was optimally calibrated for each sample to account for differences in tissue depth and thickness. Fluorescence Spectroscopy of Synthetic and Native Fluorophores—Fluorescence spectroscopy of purified, synthetic, and native fluorophores was performed using a Fluorolog FL3-22 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ). Emission and excitation spectra for ATR dimer-Et (in methanol) were acquired with excitation and emission wavelengths of 363 and 550 nm, respectively. Bandpass was set at 5 nm. Excitation spectral intensities of unprotonated and protonated ATR dimer-Et were normalized to better compare spectral shape. Native A2E, A2PE, and A2PE-H2 were extracted from the eyecups (RPE-choroid + retina) of 14 abca4–/– mice aged 12–24 months. A2E, A2PE, and A2PE-H2 were purified from the sample extracts, as described above, taken to dryness under argon, and resuspended in hexane. Emission and excitation spectra were acquired for these samples using excitation and emission wavelengths of 420 and 590 nm, respectively. Bandpass was set at 10 nm. Second Derivative Spectroscopy—Second derivative spectral data were obtained from primary absorbance and fluorescence excitation data using an algorithm contained in Sigmaplot 2002 Version 8.02 scientific graphing software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, ILL). Fluorescence Properties of abca4–/– RPE and Retina Explants—Biogenesis of A2E is thought to begin within the retina. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that precursor fluorophores might be present in this tissue. We have explored this possibility by examining fluorescence properties of explants prepared from abca4–/– retina and RPE/eyecups. The emission spectrum acquired for RPE/eyecups in this study (Fig. 2A, dashed trace) is comparable with the spectra of A2E-laden human RPE cells (20Sparrow J.R. Parish C.A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 2988-2995PubMed Google Scholar) and human lipofuscin granules (21Haralampus-Grynaviski N.M. Lamb L.E. Clancy C.M. Skumatz C. Burke J.M. Sarna T. Simon J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3179-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast, the fluorescence spectrum from retina explants demonstrated lower intensity relative to RPE/eyecups and an emission maximum of ∼625 nm (Fig. 2A, solid trace). The intensity of this emission increased in an age-dependent manner (Fig. 2B) and was not detected in age-matched wild-type mice. To identify and characterize the fluorescent compound(s) in abca4–/– retinas, chloroform-soluble extracts were prepared from the retina explants. These extracts were analyzed by HPLC with online UV-spectral and fluorescence detection. Two major peaks with similar absorbance maxima (λmax ∼510 nm) and spectra were observed (Fig. 3A, compare left and center insets). However, only the peak eluting at ∼26 min demonstrated fluorescence emission when excited at 440 nm (Fig. 3A, solid trace). Importantly, the acquired emission spectrum (Fig. 3A, right inset) was very similar to the emission spectrum observed during epifluorescence analysis of retina explants. Like the fluorophore detected in retina explants, the fluorescence intensity associated with this peak increased in an age-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). An age-dependent accumulation was not observed for the early eluting peak. Characterization of Dominant Fluorophores in abca4–/– Retinas—It is likely that one of the two compounds detected in abca4–/– retinal extracts is the ATR dimer-PE species that was recently identified in abca4–/– retinas (19Fishkin N.E. Sparrow J.R. Allikmets R. Nakanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7091-7096Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Because the fluorescence intensity of the peak eluting at ∼26 min increased in an age-dependent manner and was not present in wild-type retinas, it is likely associated with the ABCA4 mutation. We sought to determine whether this compound might be an ATR dimer conjugate. To address this issue, we purified large amounts of the ∼26-min peak (designated 26mp) from abca4–/– retinal extracts and determined its relationship to a synthetic ATR dimer conjugate using absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy. ATR dimer-Et, rather than ATR dimer-PE, was used for comparison based upon increased product yield after synthesis, its validation in a previous study (19Fishkin N.E. Sparrow J.R. Allikmets R. Nakanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7091-7096Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and the fact that PE does not contribute to absorbance or fluorescence in the examined wavelength range (250–450 nm). We confirmed that the synthesized ATR dimer-Et possessed the expected molecular mass (m/z = 594.48, Fig. 4A) and a Schiff base that was susceptible to protonation. Thus, in the presence of 0.1 n HAc, an immediate and significant bathochromic shift in the absorbance spectra (from 420 to 510 nm) was observed (Fig. 4B). This same behavior has been described for ATR dimer-PE (19Fishkin N.E. Sparrow J.R. Allikmets R. Nakanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7091-7096Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In contrast, neither bathochromic nor hypsochromic shifts were observed for 26mp under either acidic or basic conditions (data not shown). These data indicate a qualitative difference in the bond configuration and/or chemical composition between ATR dimer-Et and 26mp. A comparison of protonated ATR dimer-Et and 26mp by absorption spectroscopy revealed subtle spectral differences (Fig. 4C). These differences became more obvious after second derivative transformation. This technique improves the signal-to-noise ratio of absorbing bands and is useful in extracting qualitative information from overlapping or incompletely resolved peaks (22Antonov L. Stoyanov S.T. Appl. Spectrosc. 1993; 47: 1712-1715Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Examination of the second derivative spectral shape and trough locations provides information regarding the electronic structure of a compound. Second derivative spectra for ATR dimer-Et and 26mp spectra showed significant variations in the 250–450 nm region despite the common ∼500-nm absorption peaks (Fig. 4D). These variations indicate differences in the chemical structures of ATR dimer-Et and 26mp. Fluorescence properties of ATR dimer-Et were also distinct from those of 26mp. Although the excitation spectrum of ATR dimer-Et was not significantly affected by protonation (excitation maximum ∼363 nm, Fig. 4E), the emission spectrum was dramatically altered. Unprotonated ATR dimer-Et demonstrated a very broad emission (500–570 nm) with 363-nm excitation. Protonation of the ATR dimer-Et Schiff base narrowed the emission, resulting in a spectrum with a well defined maximum at 450 nm (Fig. 4F). Excitation of either protonated or unprotonated ATR dimer-Et at 400–440 nm produced no detectable emission, a result consistent with the excitation spectra of this compound (Fig. 4E). In contrast, 26mp showed pronounced emission intensity with excitation in this wavelength range (Fig. 3A, right inset). These data demonstrate that 26mp is not an ATR dimer conjugate. The fact that only two ∼500-nm absorbing species, which possess similar UV-visible spectra, have been identified in abca4–/– retinas (i.e. ATR dimer conjugates and A2PE-H2) leads us to deduce that the early eluting peak in Fig. 3A is likely an ATR dimer conjugate. Indeed, the absence of fluorescence emission from this peak with 440-nm excitation (Fig. 3A) and an observed hypsochromic shift (from 510 to 425 nm) at alkaline pH (data not shown) are consistent with the behavior of an ATR dimer conjugate (19Fishkin N.E. Sparrow J.R. Allikmets R. Nakanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7091-7096Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Clearly, the long wavelength fluorescence emission observed in abca4–/– retinas cannot be attributed to ATR dimer conjugates. We can therefore conclude that the compound referred to here as 26mp is, in fact, A2PE-H2. Biochemical Relationships of Native Retinal Fluorophores—We next explored the relationship of A2PE-H2 to A2E and a known A2E precursor, A2PE (23Liu J. Itagaki Y. Ben-Shabat S. Nakanishi K. Sparrow J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29354-29360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In this analysis, the native fluorophores were purified from eyecups of aged abca4–/– mice and analyzed by second derivative absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy. Chromatography of eyecup extracts with fluorescence detection demonstrates that these are abundant fluorophores in abca4–/– eyecups (Fig. 5A, solid trace). The absorbance spectrum for each fluorophore is shown in the figure inset. Excitation and emission spectra of the purified compounds (measured in hexane) are provided in Fig. 5B. It is noteworthy that although A2E, A2PE, and A2PE-H2 demonstrate distinct absorbance spectra, their excitation spectra are quite similar. A structural homology among these fluorophores becomes readily evident upon examination of the second derivative absorbance and excitation spectra. Second derivative transformation of the absorbance spectra of Fig. 5A (inset) reveals two distinct bands at ∼330 and ∼420 nm that are present in each of the fluorophores (Fig. 5, C–E, indicated by arrows). Similarly, transformation of the excitation spectra of Fig. 5B exposes two common resonant features at ∼420 and ∼465 nm in each fluorophore (Fig. 5, F–H, indicated by arrows). These data demonstrate a significant structural relationship among A2PE-H2, A2PE, and A2E. Analysis of A2PE-H2 by Mass Spectrometry—Similarities in the electronic and resonant structures of A2PE-H2, A2PE, and A2E prompted an analysis of the A2PE-H2 chemical composition. In this study, A2PE-H2 was first purified using normal phase HPLC as described above (Fig. 5A). The purified A2PE-H2 sample was then analyzed by reverse-phase LC/ESI-MS. Like the normal phase system, the reversephase system provided baseline separation of the three fluorophores (data not shown). The retention time and absorbance spectrum of the injected A2PE-H2 sample was used to confirm its identity and purity (Fig. 6A and inset). A portion of the eluted A2PE-H2 peak (from 7.3 to 8.2 min) was delivered to the mass spectrometer in real time. In the first scan event (Full ms), a major ion at 1274.85 m/z was detected (Fig. 6B). Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of this ion in the second scan event (ms2) produced a prominent daughter ion at 672.44 m/z that is consistent with a phosphoryl A2E fragment (Fig. 6C and inset). In addition, a neutral loss of 602.54 from the 1274.85 m/z parent ion was also detected (not shown). This loss is consistent with the mass of dehydrated dioleoylglycerol. Based on these data, it appears that the 1274.85 parent ion may be dioleoyl A2PE. To better elucidate the composition of the 672.44 m/z ion, a second CID was performed in the third scan event (ms3). The daughter ions from this fragmentation (Fig. 6D) included an ion with an m/z identical to that of A2E (592.50) and an ion that is consistent with the m/z of dehydrated A2E (574.46). The 592.50 m/z ion was isolated for CID in the fourth scan event (ms4) to confirm its identity. Daughter ions generated in the fourth scan event (Fig. 6E) were then compared with daughter ions generated from CID of authentic A2E (Fig. 6F). The fragmentation patterns in these two scans were nearly identical and contained the same ions at similar relative abundances. It is clear from this analysis that the 592.50 m/z ion generated from fragmentation of A2PE-H2 was indeed A2E and, therefore, the 1274.85 m/z parent ion is likely A2PE. The facile conversion of A2PE-H2 to A2PE observed here has been previously noted (18Mata N.L. Weng J. Travis G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7154-7159Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and is consistent with the oxidative lability of this compound. The Relationship between A2PE-H2 and A2E in Vivo—Data gathered from the various in vitro analyses have revealed significant similarities between A2PE-H2 and A2E. However, a direct precursor-product relationship has not been established in vivo. We have explored this issue by examining the fate of A2PE-H2 following intravitreal administration into wild-type mice. Purified A2PE-H2 was suspended in a lipid emulsion and injected into the vitreous cavity of one eye. The contralateral eye was untreated. A separate group of age and strain-matched wild-type mice received intravitreal injections of the lipid suspension alone. At the end of the treatment period, an analysis of the A2PE-H2-lipid suspension was performed to ensure that it had not degraded during the treatment period. The analysis revealed a single peak that was identified as A2PE-H2, thereby confirming the integrity of the injected sample (Fig. 7A and inset). Extracts prepared from eyes that received a single injection of the A2PE-H2-lipid suspension (1 day after injection) showed three peaks that corresponded to the retention times of A2E, A2PE, and A2PE-H2 (∼17, 20, and 27 min, respectively, Fig. 7B). Spectral analysis of the ∼27-min peak confirmed that it was A2PE-H2. At the conclusion of the study period (28 days after injection), the A2PE-H2 peak was not detectable, and the peaks at ∼17 and ∼20 min increased ∼2-fold (Fig. 7B, compare red and black traces). Spectra acquired for the peaks identified in Fig. 7B (at 17.4 and 20.8 min) were compared with spectra of authentic A2E and A2PE (Fig. 7, D and E, respectively). The spectral overlays confirmed that the identified peaks were A2E and A2PE. Extracts prepared from either uninjected (contralateral) eyes or eyes injected with the lipid suspension alone did not contain these peaks (Fig. 7C). These data clearly establish A2PE-H2 as a precursor fluorophore involved in the biogenesis of A2PE and A2E in vivo. The ocular fundi of individuals afflicted with degenerative macular diseases such as STGD1 and age-related macular degeneration show dramatic, age-dependent accumulation of lipofuscin fluorophores (24Cideciyan A.V.

It has been theorized that this fluorescence is due to lipofuscin material contained within the RPE (29Delori F.C. Dorey C.K. Staurenghi G. Arend O. Goger D.G. Weiter J.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 718-729PubMed Google Scholar, 31Delori F.C. Retinal Pigment Epithelium and Macular Disease. 1995; (Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA): 37-45Google Scholar). Ocular tissues from abca4–/– mice also accumulate lipofuscin fluorophores (32Radu R.A. Han Y. Bui T.V. Nusinowitz S. Bok D. Lichter J. Widder K. Travis G.H. Mata N.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In this animal model of STGD1, the fluorescence emission has been attributed to A2E, which accumulates within the RPE. Importantly, A2E is known to be the major long wavelength emitting fluorophore in both rodent and human lipofuscin granules (4Feeney-Burns L. Gao C.L. Berman E.R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Sci. 2000; 41: 1981-1999PubMed Google Scholar), A2E compromises an inherent capacity of the RPE for proper digestion and disposal of phagocytosed retinal debris (7Bergmann M. Schutt F. Holz F.G. Kopitz J. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 35Finnemann S.C. Leung L.W. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3842-3847Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Accumulation of this undigested debris reduces cellular viability and may compromise the RPE support role on photoreceptors (1Steinberg R.H. Doc. Ophthalmol. 1985; 60: 327-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Continued accumulation of this debris may elicit an inflammatory response leading to further pathological changes (36Zarbin M.A. Arch. Ophthalmol. 2004; 122: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Our previous investigations of A2E biosynthesis in abca4–/– mice revealed a unique 500-nm absorbing compound within retinal tissue that converts to A2E under conditions that simulate the environment inside RPE phagolysosomes (18Mata N.L. Weng J. Travis G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7154-7159Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). This compound, referred to as A2PE-H2, was also identified in postmortem retina samples from STGD1 patients. Retinal tissue from age-matched control subjects did not contain A2PE-H2 (18Mata N.L. Weng J. Travis G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7154-7159Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). We concluded, therefore, that ABCA4 mutations cause the accumulation of A2PE-H2 and that A2PE-H2 may be a precursor in the A2E biosynthetic pathway in vivo. Presently, we have sought to provide additional information regarding the biochemical properties of A2PE-H2, its relationship to other known retinal fluorophores, and its role in A2E biosynthesis in vivo. The recent identification of ATR dimer conjugates (e.g. ATR dimer-PE) in abca4–/– retinal tissues (19Fishkin N.E. Sparrow J.R. Allikmets R. Nakanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7091-7096Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) has provided an additional impetus for this study. We have found that abca4–/– retinal extracts contain both A2PE-H2 and ATR dimer conjugates. However, only A2PE-H2 accumulated in an age-dependent manner and, like A2E, produced a prominent long wavelength fluorescence emission comparable with that observed in human fundus. We have also identified distinct structural differences between ATR dimer conjugates (e.g. ATR dimer-Et) and A2PE-H2. For example, ATR dimer-Et readily demonstrated a pH-dependent, bathochromic spectral shift consistent with the presence of a basic imine nitrogen that is amendable to protonation. In contrast, we observed no change in the spectrum of A2PE-H2 when it was placed in either an acidic or a basic environment. This finding is consistent with the proposed structure for A2PE-H2, which contains a quaternary amine nitrogen that cannot be protonated (Fig. 1). It is clear from these data that A2PE-H2 is not an ATR dimer conjugate. We performed derivative spectroscopy to compare the UV-absorbing and fluorescent spectral properties of native A2PE-H2, A2E, and a known A2E precursor, A2PE. This analysis revealed remarkable similarities among these fluorophores, indicating a common composition and arrangement of chemical bonds. Additionally, analysis of native A2PE-H2 by mass spectrometry confirmed a shared structural relationship with A2PE and A2E. In this analysis, the daughter ions generated from fragmentation of A2PE-H2 were identical to daughter ions produced by fragmentation of authentic A2E. Although A2E was produced from fragmentation of A2PE-H2, we do not believe that A2E per se is a structural substituent of A2PE-H2. Rather, it is likely that electrochemical oxidation of the A2PE-H2 dihydropyridinium ring occurred in the mass spectrometer prior to fragmentation. Based on the proposed structure for A2PE-H2 (Fig. 1), oxidation would result in the formation of A2PE. It is clear from the absorbance spectrum that was acquired immediately prior to mass analysis that A2PE-H2, rather than A2PE, was delivered to the mass spectrometer (Fig. 6A, inset). Fragmentation of the ion associated with the injected sample (1274.85 m/z) produced a phosphoryl A2E fragment (672.44 m/z) and a neutral ion at 602.54 m/z consistent with the mass of dehydrated dioleoylglycerol, a known constituent of retinal membranes. The most reasonable explanation is that the 1274.85 m/z ion is dioleoyl A2PE and was generated via oxidation of A2PE-H2. Like the in vitro conversion of A2PE-H2 to A2E described previously (18Mata N.L. Weng J. Travis G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7154-7159Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), data from the MS analysis demonstrate the oxidatively labile nature of A2PE-H2 and verify the tendency of this compound to undergo a facile transformation to A2E through an A2PE intermediate. The most compelling evidence that A2PE-H2 plays a role in the A2E biosynthetic pathway comes from the observed biosynthesis of A2PE and A2E from exogenous A2PE-H2 in vivo. The fact that this conversion took place within ocular tissues of wild-type mice indicates that A2E can be generated from A2PE-H2 under normal physiological conditions. It is noteworthy that the immediate precursor of A2E, A2PE, was generated during the treatment period. Thus, as the various in vitro analyses described above indicate, A2PE-H2, A2PE, and A2E are related fluorophores involved in an unusual non-enzymatic biosynthetic pathway. A growing body of clinical evidence has implicated aberrant fundus autofluorescence and lipofuscin accumulation in the pathogenesis of retinal degeneration in patients with STGD1 and atrophic age-related macular degeneration. Studies have shown that the presence and accumulation of lipofuscin fluorophores precedes RPE and retinal cell death (24Cideciyan A.V. Aleman T.S. Swider M. Schwartz S.B. Steinberg J.D. Brucker A.J. Maguire A.M. Bennett J. Stone E.M. Jacobson S.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 25Holz F.G. Bellman C. Staudt S. Schutt F. Volcker H.E. Investig.

Thus, it is conceivable that retinal fluorophores may directly compromise the health of retinal tissues. In the present report, the abca4 null mutant mouse, which excessively accumulates retinal fluorophores and lipofuscin in an age-dependent manner, has been used as a model system to characterize the native fluorophores and validate a previously proposed biosynthetic pathway. The data reveal that A2PE-H2 is a precursor in the A2E biosynthetic pathway and support the hypothesis that A2PE-H2 is an important mediator of lipofuscin-associated retinopathies. We thank Oktai Gassymov for critical analysis of the second derivative spectral data and Quan Yuan for valuable comments on the manuscript."

AP-2α and AP-2γ interact with p53 both physically and functionally. Expression microarray results in human breast carcinoma cells with forced p53 expression revealed AP-2γ as a putative transcriptional target of p53. To confirm and extend these findings we measured the effects of forced p53 expression in human breast carcinoma cells by real-time reverse transcription–PCR, Western blotting, electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays, promoter reporter, chromatin immunoprecipitation and chromatin accessibility assays. Wild-type p53 expression rapidly induced not only AP-2γ but also AP-2α mRNA. The subsequent increase in these proteins led to increased AP-2 DNA-binding and transactivating activity. Candidate p53-binding sites were identified in the AP-2α and AP-2γ promoters. p53 binding to these cis-elements in vivo was also observed, together with a relaxation of chromatin structure in these regions. Finally, expression of either AP-2α or γ inhibited growth of human breast carcinoma cells in vitro. Taken together, our findings indicate that these AP-2 genes are targets for transcriptional activation by p53 and suggest that AP-2 proteins may mediate some of the downstream effects of p53 expression such as inhibition of proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1975436172,"Streptothricins (STs) produced by Streptomyces strains are broad-spectrum antibiotics. All STs consist of a carbamoylated d-gulosamine to which the β-lysine homopolymer (1 to 7 residues) and the amide form of the unusual amino acid streptolidine (streptolidine lactam) are attached. Although many ST-resistance genes have been identified in bacteria, including clinically isolated pathogens and ST-producing Streptomyces strains, only one resistance mechanism has been identified to date. This mechanism involves the modification of the ST molecule by monoacetylation of the moiety of the β-lysine(s). In this study, we successfully isolated a novel ST-resistance gene (sttH) from Streptomyces albulus, which is a known ST nonproducer. The in vitro analysis of SttH demonstrated that this enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the amide bond of streptolidine lactam, thereby conferring ST resistance. Interestingly, the selective toxicity of ST-D possessing 3× β-lysine moiety was altered from broad-spectrum to bacteria-specific by the hydrolysis of streptolidine lactam, although ST-F (1× β-lysine) was detoxified by SttH in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (yeasts). STs have not been clinically developed due to their toxicities; however, in this study, we showed that hydrolyzed ST-D (ST-D-acid) exhibits potent antibacterial activity even when its toxicity against eukaryotic cells is reduced by SttH. This suggests that ST-D-acid is a potential candidate for clinical development or for use as a new lead compound for drug discovery.

All STs consist of a carbamoylated d-gulosamine to which the β-lysine homopolymer (1 to 7 residues) and the amide form of the unusual amino acid streptolidine (streptolidine lactam) are attached. STs inhibit protein biosynthesis in prokaryotic cells; in addition, they strongly inhibit the growth of eukaryotes such as yeast (2Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H.

However, STs are not currently used therapeutically due to their nephrotoxicity (9Hoffmann H. Kirchner E. Knappe H. Hillesheim H.G. Hartl A. Hubler D. Chemnitius K.H. Morgenstern E. Grupe R. Arch.

To date, many ST-resistance genes have been identified in transposons such as Tn1825 and Tn1826, which have been isolated from bacteria that are resistant to ST (12Partridge S.R. Hall R.M. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2005; 43: 4298-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); such transposons have also been isolated from human pathogens such as Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (13Singh R. Schroeder C.M. Meng J. White D.G. McDermott P.F. Wagner D.D. Yang H. Simjee S. Debroy C. Walker R.D. Zhao S. J. Antimicrob.

Chemother. 2005; 55: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Bacterial resistance to antibiotics that inhibit protein biosynthesis (e.g. aminoglycosides) can occur as a result of decreased antibiotic uptake and accumulation, modification of 16 S RNA or ribosomal proteins, or enzymatic modification of the antibiotics (15Vakulenko S.B. Mobashery S. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 16: 430-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). However, in the case of bacterial resistance to STs, only one resistance mechanism has yet been identified: the resistance is due to a modification of the ST molecule by monoacetylation at the β-amino group (position 16) of β-lysine(s) (Fig. 1). In fact, in ST producers such as S. lavendulae (16Horinouchi S. Furuya K. Nishiyama M. Suzuki H. Beppu T. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1929-1937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Streptomyces rochei (17Fernández-Moreno M.A. Vallín C. Malpartida F. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6929-6936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Streptomyces noursei (18Krugel H. Fiedler G. Haupt I. Sarfert E. Simon H. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 62: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19Grammel N. Pankevych K. Demydchuk J. Lambrecht K. Saluz H.P. Krugel H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the ST-resistance genes encoding N-acetyltransferase (NAT) have been identified and their role in self-resistance against their own STs has been investigated. Based on this resistance mechanism and the fact that streptothricin D (ST-D) is a more effective antibiotic than streptothricin F (ST-F), the moiety of β-lysine(s) has been shown to play a crucial role in antibiotic activity. On the other hand, Inamori et al. (20Inamori Y. Tominaga H. Okuno M. Sato H. Tsujibo H. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1988; 36: 1577-1580Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and Taniyama et al. (21Taniyama H. Sawada Y. Kitagawa T. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1971; 24: 662-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) have independently reported that ST-F-acid (Fig. 1, termed as racenomycin-A-acid in their studies), chemically prepared from ST-F, did not exhibit antibiotic activity against bacteria, fungi, and plants; however, the biological activity of ST-D-acid was not tested. This result confirmed that streptolidine lactam is essential for antibiotic activity. We therefore hypothesized that microorganisms showing resistance to STs through alternative resistance mechanisms might produce an enzyme that hydrolyzes streptolidine lactam, thereby inactivating STs. Actinomycetes are known to produce many natural products with structural diversity occurring due to the unique substrate specificities of the enzymes. Therefore, we focused on Streptomyces, the representative strains belonging to actinomycetes, to efficiently identify our target enzyme. Here, we describe the cloning of a gene whose product confers ST resistance through the modification of streptolidine lactam, as expected. Additionally, we used the recombinant enzyme of this gene product to investigate its functions and properties. We also discuss an interesting observation regarding the selective toxicity of an ST compound that was converted by the gene product. Chemicals—STs (clonNAT, a mixture of ST-F and ST-D; the ST-F: ST-D ratio was ∼5:1) were obtained from Werner BioAgents (Jena, Germany). All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and General Techniques for DNA Manipulation—Streptomyces albulus NBRC14147 was used as the DNA source for cloning of the sttH gene. The media and growth conditions for S. albulus NBRC14147 have been described previously (22Takagi H. Hoshino Y. Nakamori S. Inouye S. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2000; 89: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The E. coli-Streptomyces shuttle vector pWHM3 (23Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A.

The nat gene encoding NAT for STs was obtained from the pHN15 plasmid (Werner BioAgents). The pQE30 plasmid, E. coli M15(pREP4) (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan), and E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′ (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) were used to overexpress the recombinant protein. Recombinant DNA procedures for the E. coli and Streptomyces strains were performed using standard techniques (23Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. 2000; (John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK)Google Scholar, 24Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2001; (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar). Southern blotting was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) direct nucleic acid labeling and detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae CKY8 strain (MATα ura3-52 leu2-3112) and the yeast episomal plasmid pAD4 were employed for the expression of the sttH and nat genes in S. cerevisiae. This plasmid is known as the E. coli-Saccharomyces shuttle vector and contains selection markers, specifically, the ampicillin-resistance gene (for E. coli) and the LEU2 gene (for S. cerevisiae). The CKY8 strain was transformed using the Yeastmaker Yeast Transformation System 2 (Clontech). S. cerevisiae CKY8 strains possessing pAD4 derivatives were grown in a synthetic complete medium (25Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar) lacking l-leucine (SC-Leu) or yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium (25Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). The following microorganisms were used for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) studies with STs and ST-acids: S. cerevisiae S288C (same genetic background as strain CKY8), Schizosaccharomyces pombe L972, E. coli W3110, Bacillus subtilis NBRC13169, Staphylococcus aureus AB, and S. aureus FIR1169 (26Igarashi H. Fujikawa H. Usami H. Kawabata S. Morita T. Infect. Immun. 1984; 44: 175-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR Amplification of the Genes Encoding NATs in the Streptomyces Strains—Based on the highly conserved amino acid sequence of the NATs of S. lavendulae (16Horinouchi S. Furuya K. Nishiyama M. Suzuki H. Beppu T. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1929-1937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), S. rochei (17Fernández-Moreno M.A. Vallín C. Malpartida F. J.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we designed primers 5′-GACGC(G/C)GA(A/G)GC(G/C)ATCGA(A/G)G (G/C)(G/C)CT(G/C)GA-3′ and 5′-GTTST(C/T)GTT(G/C)GT(G/C) AC(C/T)TC(G/C)AGCCA-3′. PCR amplification was performed under the following conditions: 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min. Cloning of the sttH Gene of S. albulus NBRC14147—The genomic DNA of S. albulus NBRC14147 was partially digested with Sau3AI. The Sau3AI fragments that were larger than 2.0 kb were then ligated into the BamHI site of the pWHM3 plasmid carrying the thiostrepton-resistance gene. S. lividans TK23 was transformed using this ligated DNA, and transformants that were resistant to both STs, i.e. to ST-D and ST-F (100 μg/ml of a mixture of ST-F and ST-D with an ST-F:ST-D ratio of ∼5:1) and thiostrepton (20 μg/ml) were isolated on R5 agar medium (23Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. 2000; (John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK)Google Scholar). Of the 13 transformants, one harboring a plasmid containing a 2.9-kb insert (pWHM3-st11) was selected for further experiments (Fig. 2). After we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the 2.9-kb fragment, one plasmid carrying open reading frame-2 (ORF2)-ORF3 (pWHM3-orf2–3) and another carrying ORF1 (pWHM3-orf1) were constructed using pWHM3 (Fig. 2). Estimation of the Start Codon of the sttH (ORF2) Gene—To estimate the start codon in the sttH gene, seven forward primers and one reverse primer were designed, as shown schematically in Fig. 2, and were used to amplify the sttH gene. Additional BamHI sites (5′-GGGGGATCC-3′) were attached to all forward primers, and an additional HindIII site (5′-ACCAAGCTT-3′) was attached to the reverse primer. PCR cycles were performed under standard conditions. After sequence confirmation, each of the seven amplified fragments was inserted into the same site of pQE30 to obtain the following plasmids: pQE30-SHF1R (carrying a PCR fragment amplified with primers SH-F1 and SH-R), pQE30-SHF2R (SH-F2 and SH-R), pQE30-SHF3R (SH-F3 and SH-R), pQE30-SHF4R (SH-F4 and SH-R), pQE30-SHF5R (SH-F5 and SH-R), pQE30-SHF6R (SH-F6 and SH-R), and pQE30-SHF7R (SH-F7 and SH-R). Each resulting plasmid was introduced into E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′. In these transformants, the MICs for STs were determined on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates (24Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2001; (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar) containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml), 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and STs (0–100 μg/ml, a mixture of ST-F and ST-D with a ST-F:ST-D ratio of ∼5:1). Identification of ST-F- and ST-D-derived Compounds Formed by rSttH, and Kinetic Studies of rSttH—Following the protocol specified by the manufacturer (Qiagen), the recombinant SttH (rSttH) overexpressed as the N-terminal His6-tagged fusion protein was purified from the cell-free extract of E. coli M15(pREP4) harboring pQE30-SHF6R. The reaction mixture (500 μl) contained 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 1 mg/ml ST-F or ST-D, and 100 μg/ml purified rSttH. After incubation of the reaction mixture with or without rSttH at 30 °C for 1 h, chloroform extraction was carried out to remove proteins. The water layers were then analyzed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an ion-pair reagent. The analytical conditions were as follows: column, C18 reverse-phase Cosmosil 5C18-AR-II (250 × 4.6 mm) (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan); column temperature, 30 °C; detection, 210 nm; and flow rate, 1 ml/min. We used two different mobile phases: 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid, 18% acetonitrile (for reaction with ST-F) and 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid, 23% acetonitrile (for reaction with ST-D). Kinetic assays were performed under conditions identical to those described above, except that the enzyme concentration (2 μg/ml) and the reaction time (5 min) were reduced to enable measurement of steady-state kinetic parameters. All assays were carried out under linear conditions. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 15 μl of 2 n HCl, and the products were then analyzed by HPLC. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to estimate the kinetic constants. The native molecular mass of rSttH was estimated by gel filtration using a Cosmosil 5Diol-300 column (7.8 × 600 mm; Nacalai Tesque) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 100 mm Na2SO4. Purification of ST Compounds—ST-F and ST-D were purified from commercially available STs (a mixture of ST-F and ST-D) by reverse-phase HPLC under conditions identical to those described above, except for column size (250 × 10 mm), flow rate (4.72 ml/min), and acetonitrile concentration (25%). After removal of the organic solvent from the HPLC fractions, the aqueous layer was freeze-dried to yield the compounds in the form of a white powder. The enzymatically synthesized ST-F-acid and ST-D-acid were purified by the same procedure as that described for ST-F and ST-D purification. Determination of ST-F-acid and ST-D-acid Structures—Positive ion electrospray ionization tandem mass spectra (ESI-MS/MS) images of the ST compounds were obtained in the positive mode using a Finnigan MAT TSQ 7000 (Quadrapole Tandem MS/MS Analyzer). The 1H NMR spectral data for ST-F-acid and ST-D-acid were recorded at 500 MHz using a JEOL LNM-LA500 spectrometer and were the following: (i) ST-F-acid, 1H NMR (500 MHz, D2O) δ: 1.60 (4H, m, H-17, 18), 2.51 (1H, dd, J = 8 and 17 Hz, H-15), 2.62 (1H, dd, J = 5 and 17 Hz, H-15), 2.86 (2H, br s, H-19), 2.94 (1H, dd, J = 10 and 13 Hz, H-4), 3.08 (1H, dd, J = 3 and 13 Hz, H-3), 3.49 (1H, m, H-16), 3.55 (2H, d, J = 6 Hz, H-12), 3.98 (2H, m, H-5), 3.99 (1H, t, J = 3, Hz, H-9), 4.05 (1H, dd, J = 3 and 10 Hz, H-8), 4.14 (1H, t, J = 6 Hz, H-11), 4.31 (1H, d, J = 5 Hz, H-2), 4.59 (1H, d, J = 4 Hz, H-10), 4.95 (1H, d, J = 9 Hz, H-7). (ii) ST-D-acid, 1H NMR (500 MHz, D2O) δ: 1.43 (4H, m, H-18, 24), 1.51 (4H, m, H-17, 23), 1.60 (4H, m, H-29, 30), 2.40 (1H, dd, J = 8 and 16 Hz, H-27), 2.43 (1H, dd, J = 8 and 16 Hz, H-21), 2.48 (1H, dd, J = 8 and 16 Hz, H-15), 2.50 (1H, dd, J = 5 and 17 Hz, H-27), 2.53 (1H, dd, J = 5 and 17 Hz, H-21), 2.57 (1H, dd, J = 5 and 17 Hz, H-15), 2.85 (2H, m, H-31), 2.86 (2H, br s, H-19), 2.94 (1H, dd, J = 10 and 13 Hz, H-4), 3.05 (3H, m, acetyl), 3.08 (1H, dd, J = 3 and 13 Hz, H-3), 3.45 (4H, m, H-19, 25), 3.48 (3H, m, H-16, -22, and -28), 3.54 (2H, d, J = 6 Hz, H-12), 3.98 (1H, t, J = 3 Hz, H-9), 3.99 (2H, m, H-5), 4.06 (1H, dd, J = 3 and 10 Hz, H-8), 4.14 (1H, t, J = 6 Hz, H-11), 4.31 (1H, d, J = 5 Hz, H-2), 4.58 (1H, d, J = 4 Hz, H-10), and 4.94 (1H, d, J = 9 Hz, H-7). Investigation of the ST-D Resistance Profile in the E. coli and S. cerevisiae Strains Overexpressing SttH or NAT—To construct an E. coli strain that overexpressed NAT, the following set of primers was designed and used for PCR: 5′-GGGGGATCCACCACTCTTGACGACACGGCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACCAAGCTTTCAGGGGCAGGGCATGCTCAT-3′ (reverse). Restriction enzyme sites (underlined) and a stop codon (boldface) were introduced into these primers. An expression vector (pQE30-nat) possessing a fragment amplified with these primers was constructed using pQE30. The MICs of ST-F and ST-D in the E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′ strain harboring pQE30-nat or pQE30-SHF6R were determined on LB agar plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml), 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and STs (0–4 mm). We also constructed a S. cerevisiae CKY8 strain overexpressing NAT or SttH by the following procedure. The following two sets of primers with an additional restriction site (underlined) and a stop codon (boldface) were designed and used for PCR: 5′-ACCAAGCTTAATATGACCACTCTTGACGACACG-3′ (forward primer for the nat gene), 5′-AAACTGCAGTCAGGGGCAGGGCATGCTCAT-3′ (reverse primer for the nat gene); 5′-ACCAAGCTTACCATGCCCCCCGAGACCGCCGCG-3′ (forward primer for the sttH gene), 5′-AAACTGCAGTCAGCGCGCTGGAGCGGGCGG-3′ (reverse primer for the sttH gene). After sequence confirmation, the amplified fragments were inserted into the same sites of pAD4 to yield pAD4-nat and pAD4-sttH in which these genes were expressed under the control of the constitutive yeast promoter of alcohol dehydrogenase. An S. cerevisiae CKY8 strain harboring pAD4-nat or pAD4-sttH was grown in SC-Leu medium containing STs (ST-F or ST-D, 0–4 mm), and the MICs for ST-F and ST-D were then determined. Cloning and Sequencing Analysis of the ST-resistance Gene—Based on the present studies of MICs for STs in the Streptomyces strains that have not been accepted as ST producers, S. albulus NBRC14147 was found to be more resistant to STs than the ST producer S. lavendulae NBRC12789 (Table 1). Furthermore, PCR using primers designed for genes that encode NATs for STs and the genomic DNA of the NBRC14147 strain as a template did not show any amplified fragments. However, a specific amplified fragment was detected when the genomic DNA of S. lavendulae NBRC12789 was used (data not shown). Therefore, because the NBRC14147 strain was not believed to contain a homologous gene encoding NAT, this strain was selected as a source of the novel ST-resistance gene. To obtain the ST-resistance gene, the NBRC14147 strain genomic library was constructed with the pWHM3 plasmid carrying the thiostrepton-resistance gene. This library was introduced into S. lividans TK23, which is sensitive to STs and thiostrepton, and transformants resistant to both thiostrepton (20 μg/ml) and STs (>400 μg/ml, a mixture of ST-F and ST-D with ST-F:ST-D ratio of ∼5:1) were isolated. From these transformants, we selected one that harbored the pWHM3 plasmid carrying a 2.9-kb fragment (pWHM3-st11, Fig. 2 and Table 1) for further experiments because Southern blotting using this fragment as a probe revealed that all plasmids isolated from these transformants carried the 2.9-kb fragment (data not shown).TABLE 1ST resistance profiles of the Streptomyces strainsStreptomyces strainsMIC of STsST productionμg/mlS. lavendulae NBRC12789400aATCC medium 5 plates containing STs (0-400 μg/ml).YesS. albulus NBRC14147>400aATCC medium 5 plates containing STs (0-400 μg/ml).NoS. lividans TK236.25aATCC medium 5 plates containing STs (0-400 μg/ml).No +pWHM36.25bATCC medium 5 plates containing STs (0-400 μg/ml) and thiostrepton (20 μg/ml).

Open table in a new tab The sequencing analysis of the 2.9-kb DNA fragment and frame analysis with the codon usage for Streptomyces strains (27Bibb M.J. Findlay P.R. Johnson M.W. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 30: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) revealed two ORFs (ORF1 and -2) and one partial ORF (ORF3) (Fig. 2). To determine the functions of the individual ORFs, we searched the relevant databases (UniProt) with their translated products using BLAST (28Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar); the results are summarized in Fig. 2. In brief, the three ORFs showed similarity to esterase and β-lactamase (ORF1), isochorismatase-like hydrolase (ORF2), and lipase (ORF3). Thus, this fragment contained no gene homologous to the nat gene. To verify the genes that were responsible for ST resistance, we constructed plasmids pWHM3-orf1 and pWHM3-orf2–3, which carried ORF1 and ORF2-ORF3, respectively (Fig. 2), and introduced them into S. lividans TK23. MIC studies confirmed that the transformant harboring pWHM3-orf2–3 showed ST resistance (Table 1). Considering the fact that the pWHM3-orf2–3 plasmid carried only a partial form of ORF3, ORF2 was considered to confer STs resistance and was designated as sttH, a novel ST-resistance gene. Estimation of the Start Codon of the sttH Gene—Based on the results of the sequencing analysis and frame analysis, eight possible start codons (ATG and GTG, positions 1 to 8; Fig. 2) were identified in the sttH gene. Furthermore, the absence of the combination of a promoter region and a ribosome binding site, which is generally found in Streptomyces strains, made it difficult to identify the start codon. Therefore, we constructed six types of rSttH as N-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins, each of which had a different N-terminal region, to estimate a start codon based on their enzymatic activities indicated by MIC values. We constructed the expression plasmids for E. coli, pQE30-SHF1R (carrying the sttH gene from position 1), pQE30-SHF2R (position 2), pQE30-SHF3R (positions 3 and 4), pQE30-SHF4R (position 5), pQE30-SHF5R (positions 6 and 7), and pQE30-SHF6R (position 8); we also constructed pQE30-SHF7R even though it was not expected that the GTG codon at position 9 would be a possible start codon because the resultant peptide product was extremely short. After introducing these 7 plasmids and pQE30 (no insert) into E. coli, the MICs of STs (a mixture of ST-F and ST-D) were determined to be 12.5 μg/ml (E. coli strain possessing pQE30), 50 μg/ml (in each of pQE30-SHF1R, pQE30-SHF2R, and pQE30-SHF3R), 100 μg/ml (in each of pQE30-SHF4R and pQE30-SHF5R), >100 μg/ml (pQE30-SHF6R), and 12.5 μg/ml (pQE30-SHF7R). This suggests that the position 8 codon could function as a start codon in S. albulus NBRC14147. Identification and Structure Determination of the ST-F- and ST-D-derived Compounds Converted by rSttH—A highly purified rSttH obtained by nickel affinity chromatography was incubated with ST-F. An rSttH-dependent product eluted with a retention time longer than that of ST-F on reverse-phase HPLC was specifically detected in the reaction mixture without any additives such as cofactors or metal ions (Fig. 3). Similarly, an rSttH-dependent product was also detected when ST-D was used as a substrate (data not shown). To determine the structures of the rSttH-dependent products thus obtained, these compounds were purified and analyzed by ESI-MS and NMR. The molecular masses of ST-F and ST-F-derived compounds were determined to be 503 (m/z = 504 [M + H]+) and 521 (m/z = 522 [M + H]+), respectively, by ESI-MS analysis (Fig. 4, A and B). In addition, ESI-MS/MS spectra also revealed that this change in the molecular mass (18 Da) had occurred in the streptolidine lactam moiety. A correlative observation was also noted in the ST-D-derived compound (Fig. 4, C and D). This, together with the finding that the primary structure of SttH is similar to that of isochorismatase-like hydrolase, indicates that rSttH catalyzes the hydrolysis of the amide bond of streptolidine lactam. To confirm these predicted structures, we performed NMR analysis, finding that the obtained 1H NMR spectral features of the streptolidine moiety (see “Experimental Procedures”) were in complete agreement with those of a chemically synthesized streptolidine (Fig. 1) reported by Jackson et al. (29Jackson M.D. Gould S.J. Zabriskie T.M. J. Org. Chem. 2002; 67: 2934-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The rSttH products from ST-F and ST-D were thus determined to be ST-F-acid and ST-D-acid, respectively.FIGURE 4ESI-MS/MS analysis of the rSttH product from ST-F (ST-F-acid) and ST-D (ST-D-acid).

https://openalex.org/W2169810364,"The underlying cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to be the beta-amyloid aggregates formed mainly by Abeta1-42 peptide. Protective pentapeptides [e.g., Leu-Pro-Phe-Phe-Asp (LPFFD)] have been shown to prevent neuronal toxicity of Abeta1-42 by arresting and reversing fibril formation. Here we report that an endogenous tetrapeptide, endomorphin-2 (End-2, amino acid sequence: YPFF), defends against Abeta1-42 induced neuromodulatory effects at the cellular level. Although End-2 does not interfere with the kinetics of Abeta fibrillogenesis according to transmission electron microscopic studies and quasielastic light scattering measurements, it binds to Abeta1-42 during aggregation, as revealed by tritium-labeled End-2 binding assay and circular dichroism measurements. The tetrapeptide attenuates the inhibitory effect on cellular redox activity of Abeta1-42 in a dose-dependent manner, as measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,-5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. In vitro and in vivo electrophysiological experiments show that End-2 also protects against the field excitatory postsynaptic potential attenuating and the NMDA-evoked response-enhancing effect of Abeta1-42. Studies using [D-Ala (2), N-Me-Phe (4), Gly (5)-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO), a mu-opioid receptor agonist, show that the protective effects of the tetrapeptide are not mu-receptor modulated. The endogenous tetrapeptide End-2 may serve as a lead compound for the drug development in the treatment of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2062282323,"The malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum has two nucleosome assembly proteins, PfNapS and PfNapL (Chandra, B. R., Olivieri, A., Silvestrini, F., Alano, P., and Sharma, A. (2005) Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 142, 237–247). We show that both PfNapS and PfNapL interact with histone oligomers but only PfNapS is able to deposit histones onto DNA. This property of PfNapS is divalent cation-dependent and ATP-independent. Deletion of the terminal subdomains of PfNapS abolishes its nucleosome assembly capabilities, but the truncated protein retains its ability to bind histones. Both PfNapS and PfNapL show binding to the linker histone H1 suggesting their probable role in extraction of H1 from chromatin fibers. Our data suggests distinct sites of interaction for H1 versus H3/H4 on PfNapS. We show that PfNapS and PfNapL are phosphorylated both in vivo and in vitro by casein kinase-II, and this modification is specifically inhibited by heparin. Circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, and chymotrypsin fingerprinting data together suggest that PfNapL may undergo very small and subtle structural changes upon phosphorylation. Specifically, phosphorylation of PfNapL increases its affinity 3-fold for core histones H3, H4, and for the linker histone H1. Finally, we demonstrate that PfNapS is able to extract histones from both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated PfNapL, potentially for histone deposition onto DNA. Based on these results, we suggest that the P. falciparum NapL is involved in the nucleocytoplasmic relay of histones, whereas PfNapS is likely to be an integral part of the chromatin assembly motors in the parasite nucleus.

The major players in this process include multisubunit chromatin remodeling enzymes, histone-modifying enzymes, and histone chaperones (5Krude T. Keller C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 6Tyler J.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2268-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7Lusser A. Kadonaga J.T.

Nucleosome assembly protein (Nap), chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1), antisilencing function-1 (Asf1), and histone regulatory protein A (HirA) are histone chaperones that are involved in the deposition of core histones onto DNA (10Ito T.

Nucleosome assembly proteins function along with chromatin-remodeling enzymes such as ACF (ATP utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor) and CHD1 (chromodomain containing protein) to generate uniformly spaced nucleosomes (10Ito T.

Yeast Nap1 exchanges histone H2A-H2B dimers from nucleosomes resulting in chromatin fluidity, which assists processes like transcription (16Levchenko V. Jackson V.

Several Nap family proteins get phosphorylated with casein-kinase II, and the phosphorylation status of human Nap-2 changes during the cell cycle (23Dong A. Liu Z. Zhu Y. Yu F. Li Z. Cao K. Shen W.H.

Commun. 2003; 306: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) suggesting the importance of this protein family in eukaryotic cells. We have recently described two nucleosome assembly proteins from P. falciparum, PfNapS and PfNapL (1Chandra B.R. Olivieri A. Silvestrini F. Alano P. Sharma A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 142: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Both of these proteins form complexes with histone tetramer [(H3-H4)2] as well as histone octamer (formed by two heterodimers of H2A-H2B and a tetramer of histone H3-histone H4) (1Chandra B.R. Olivieri A. Silvestrini F. Alano P. Sharma A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 142: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here, we show that PfNapS and PfNapL, apart from interacting with core histones, also interact with the linker histone H1. Native gels and ELISA 4The abbreviations used are: ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; CK-II, caseinkinase II; DTT, dithiothreitol. -based assays indicate that DNA is able to compete with the interaction of PfNapS and PfNapL with core histones. Plasmid supercoiling assays suggest that PfNapS is able to deposit histones onto DNA, whereas PfNapL is not. This is in agreement with the nuclear localization of PfNapS and the predominantly cytoplasmic positioning of PfNapL (1Chandra B.R. Olivieri A. Silvestrini F. Alano P. Sharma A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 142: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Histone deposition by PfNapS requires divalent cations, and the process is ATP-independent. Our current studies indicate that PfNapS is phosphorylated both in vivo and in vitro by casein kinase-II, and this modification is inhibited by heparin, a specific inhibitor for CK-II. Circular dichroism spectroscopy, tryptophan fluorescence studies, and mild proteolysis data suggest that phosphorylation may induce small and subtle structural changes in PfNapL. We show that the histone binding activity PfNapL is enhanced significantly upon phosphorylation. Finally, we provide data to show that PfNapS is able to displace both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated PfNapL from PfNapL-histone complexes. Together, our analysis provides a model of histone relay from cytoplasm to the nucleus in P. falciparum based on these two nucleosome assembly proteins. Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The proteins PfNapS and PfNapL were expressed and purified as described earlier (1Chandra B.R. Olivieri A. Silvestrini F. Alano P. Sharma A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 142: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). PfNapS-HT (30–220 amino acid residues, HT refers to a construct missing terminal subdomains from 1 to 29 and 221 to 269) was cloned into pET28a, expressed, and purified like full-length PfNapS (1Chandra B.R. Olivieri A. Silvestrini F. Alano P. Sharma A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 142: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Calf thymus histones were obtained commercially from Roche and used as described earlier (1Chandra B.R. Olivieri A. Silvestrini F. Alano P. Sharma A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 142: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Tanaka Y. Tawaramoto-Sasanuma M. Kawaguchi S. Ohta T. Yoda K. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. Methods. 2004; 33: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, a total of 2 mg each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 lyophilized calf thymus histones (Roche Diagnostics) were dissolved in unfolding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 m urea, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 2 m NaCl) by rocking for 4 h at 20°C. The concentration of histones was kept at 1 mg/ml. The unfolded histones were transferred to a 3.5-kDa cut off dialysis bag and dialyzed against refolding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 2 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5% glycerol) with three changes at 8-h intervals. The contents were concentrated in a centriprep (Millipore) and loaded onto a S200 (Amersham Biosciences) GPC column in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl. The histone octamers and tetramers were collected in separate fractions (a chromatogram is provided in the supplemental information). The purified fractions were buffer-exchanged into histone storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 500 mm NaCl), stored in 25-μl aliquots at 1 mg/ml concentration, and transferred to –70 °C. Plate-based Histone Binding Assays—A total of 100 ng of each of the individual core histones H2A, H2B, H3, H4, and linker histone H1 were coated on an ELISA plate and allowed to interact with 25 ng of PfNapS or PfNapL proteins. The ELISAs were developed as described earlier (1Chandra B.R. Olivieri A. Silvestrini F. Alano P. Sharma A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 142: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In assays where phosphorylated PfNapS or PfNapL were used, commercially available casein kinase-II (New England Biolabs) was used to phosphorylate recombinant proteins (see below). Phosphorylation Assays—A total of 1 μg of PfNapS was phosphorylated with either commercial casein kinase II (New England Biolabs) or with P. falciparum lysate in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 1 h. In cases where parasite lysate was used, PfNap proteins were immunoprecipitated from the reactions. The phosphorylated samples were resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiographed. Heparin (Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 20 ng/μl of the reaction mixture for inhibition studies. Histone Binding Assays Using Native Gel Electrophoresis—Equimolar quantities of PfNapS, PfNapS-HT, or PfNapL were incubated with 1 μg of either histone tetramer or histone octamer in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT at 37 °C for 1 h. A total of 1 μg of plasmid DNA (pBluescript, 2.9 kb) was included in competition reactions. The complexes so formed were resolved on 7.5% native polyacrylamide gels in 1× TAE buffer at room temperature and later stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. DNA Supercoiling Assays—The assays were performed according to Ref. 14Fyodorov D.V. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 499-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar with following changes: the plasmid DNA (pBluescript, 2.9 kb) was relaxed by topoisomerase I (Promega) for 1 h. A total of 1 μg of relaxed plasmid from this reaction (along with topo I) was used for each supercoiling assay by incubating 1 μg of PfNapS or PfNapL or PfNapS-HT with 1 μg of either histone tetramer or octamer in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 1 mm DTT, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 1 h. The samples were deproteinized and analyzed on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel in 1× TAE buffer. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light. Circular Dichroism and Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated PfNapS and PfNapL were buffer exchanged into 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. Far UV CD spectra was recorded on Jasco J810 at 25 °C in a quartz cuvette of 0.2-cm path length between wavelengths 190 and 250 nm, at a scan speed of 200 nm/min over three accumulations. CK-II phosphorylated PfNapS and PfNapL were buffer-exchanged into 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. The fluorescence measurements were recorded at room temperature in a PerkinElmer LS 50B spectrometer with the excitation slit of 5 nm and emission slit of 10 nm at a scan speed of 900 nm/min. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated proteins were recorded from 310 to 500 nm with excitation at 280 nm. Fluorescence intensities were averaged across four scans. Chymotrypsin Fingerprinting—A total of 100 μg of PfNapL was phosphorylated using casein kinase II (New England Biolabs) according to published protocols (100-μl volume). An identical reaction without ATP was also done, and this was used as unphosphorylated PfNapL control in the chymotrypsin digestion experiment. A total of 100 ng of chymotrypsin was added to the 100 μg of PfNapL and incubated at 37 °C. After the indicated time points, 10 μl of reaction mixture was taken out from both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated PfNapL tubes, and digestion was stopped by adding protease inhibitor mixture and loading buffer. The samples were boiled and resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. PfNapS and PfNapL May Occupy the Same Binding Site on Histones—Prior to the study of histone deposition on DNA by PfNapS and PfNapL, we addressed the histone binding properties of PfNapS and PfNapL in the presence of plasmid DNA by native PAGE techniques (Fig. 1). The addition of DNA to PfNapS did not change its mobility on native gels suggesting that PfNapS may not interact with DNA on its own (Fig. 1A, lane 2). The histone tetramers and octamers alone did not enter native gels because of their basic charge character (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 5, respectively). Even in the presence of DNA, the histone tetramers and octamers did not enter native gels (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 6) because they are known to form higher order aggregates with DNA in the absence of histone chaperones as reported in previous studies (6Tyler J.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2268-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, the complexes of PfNapS interacted with both histone tetramer and octamer and migrated on native gels like a specific macromolecular assembly (Fig. 1A, lanes 7 and 9). Further, DNA could compete this interaction suggesting that histones have higher affinity for DNA than PfNapS (Fig. 1A, lanes 8 and 9). PfNapS-HT behaved similarly to full-length PfNapS in its interaction with the histone octamer (Fig. 1B). The protein PfNapL also formed complexes with the histone tetramer and histone octamer, and again DNA could compete this interaction (Fig. 1C). We then incubated PfNapS and PfNapL together and compared their interaction with histones (Fig. 1D). In the absence of histones, PfNapS and PfNapL retained their individual mobility and did not form a complex with each other (Fig. 1D, compare lane 7 with lanes 1 and 4). In the presence of histone tetramer or octamer, most of the PfNapS was bound to histones, whereas there was negligible binding seen with PfNapL. These data indicate that PfNapS has a higher affinity for histones as compared with PfNapL and suggest that both PfNapS/PfNapL are likely to occupy the same binding site on histones. The Terminal Subdomains of PfNapS Are Required for Both Proper Release of Histone Cargo on DNA and for Nucleosome Assembly—DNA supercoiling is a standard assay to study histone deposition onto plasmid DNA (14Fyodorov D.V. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 499-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For further dissection of histone-Nap-DNA interactions, we incubated DNA with histones and PfNap proteins, deproteinized the samples, and analyzed the migration of the complexes on ethidium bromide-stained native polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 2A). Neither PfNapS nor the histone octamer alone induced supercoiling in DNA, and DNA in presence of either of these migrated mostly in open circular form. However, in the presence of PfNapS and histone octamer, relaxed DNA was converted to supercoiled forms suggesting deposition of histone octamers onto DNA (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Deletion of the head-(1–29) and acidic-(221–269) subdomains from PfNapS (PfNapS-HT) abolished its histone deposition property (Fig. 2A, lane 7). We then tested whether the histone deposition activity was lost by PfNapS-HT because of its inability to interact with histones. We did not find any significant difference between PfNapS and PfNapS-HT in their interaction with core histones, but PfNapS-HT binding to linker histone H1 was reduced by 3-fold (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that the terminal subdomains of PfNapS are required for the proper release of core histones onto DNA. In contrast to PfNapS, PfNapL was unable to deposit histones in identical assays (Fig. 2A, lane 5). Because PfNapS has higher affinity for histones H3 and H4 than for H2A and H2B, we tested whether PfNapS could deposit histone tetramers onto DNA and facilitate subnucleosome assembly as well, using the same plasmid supercoiling assays (Fig. 2C). Once again, PfNapS was able to deposit histone tetramer onto DNA (Fig. 2C, lane 4), whereas PfNapL was not (lane 5). We also tested whether PfNapL could stimulate or cooperate with PfNapS in histone deposition. The addition of PfNapL did not change the extent of DNA supercoiling induced by PfNapS alone (data not shown). In earlier studies on histone deposition by other eukaryotic Nap proteins (14Fyodorov D.V. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 499-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), Nap proteins were first preincubated with histones for 30 min, and later DNA was added. We tested the above method, as well as simultaneous addition of all three components (Nap proteins, histones, and DNA) in the supercoiling assays (Fig. 2C). We did not observe any significant difference in the results from these alternative methods. PfNapS Requires Divalent Cations for Histone Deposition onto DNA—The concentrations of Mg2+ and Ca 2+ in the nucleoplasm are in the range of 2–4 mm and 4–6 mm, respectively (32Horn P.J. Peterson C.L. Science. 2002; 297: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 33Strick R. Srissel P.L. Gavrilov K. Levi-Setti R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We tested whether PfNapS-mediated histone deposition was dependent on divalent cations (Fig. 3). The addition of 1 mm EDTA completely abolished the histone deposition by PfNapS (Fig. 3A, lane 6), whereas optimal activity was observed in the presence of 1–10 mm MgCl2. Similarly, EGTA abrogated histone deposition by PfNapS (Fig. 3B), and the activity was optimal in 1–10 mm CaCl2. It is likely that the acidic nature histone chaperones provides multiple divalent coordination sites where Mg2+ and Ca2+ may be accommodated. Phosphorylation of PfNapS by Casein Kinase II and with P. falciparum Extracts—Many of the eukaryotic Nap proteins as well as PfNapL get phosphorylated with casein kinase-II (1Chandra B.R. Olivieri A. Silvestrini F. Alano P. Sharma A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 142: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Dong A. Liu Z. Zhu Y. Yu F. Li Z. Cao K. Shen W.H. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 1446-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26Li M. Strand D. Krehan A. Pyerin W. Heid H. Neumann B. Mechler B.M. J. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 298: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). P. falciparum extract was obtained from mixed asexual stages of the parasite and used for phosphorylation of PfNapS (Fig. 4, lane 2). To test whether PfNapS is a target of CK-II, we used commercial recombinant enzyme in kinase assays (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). Heparin, a specific inhibitor for CK-II, inhibited PfNapS phosphorylation by both parasite lysate as well as by recombinant CK-II (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 3, respectively). Effect of Phosphorylation on PfNapS and PfNapL Conformations—Circular dichroism spectroscopy studies were performed to study the secondary structural changes in PfNapL and PfNapS upon phosphorylation (Fig. 5). Characteristic spectra of a protein containing both α helical and β sheet structures were obtained for both PfNapL and PfNapS. Circular dichroism spectra of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated PfNapL/PfNapS suggested the possibility of very small and subtle conformational changes in the structures of these proteins upon phosphorylation (Fig. 5). We also measured tryptophan fluorescence of these proteins in phosphorylated and unphosphorylated states. Fluorescence was quenched in the case of phosphorylated PfNapL, suggesting the burial of the tryptophans Trp-103 and/or Trp-190 upon phosphorylation. PfNapS also showed fluorescence quenching upon phosphorylation (Fig. 6). PfNapS has five tryptophan residues, Trp-80, Trp-159, Trp-183, Trp-188, and Trp-209. Fluorescence measurements indicated emission maxima at 370 nm for this protein. Residues Trp-80 and Trp-159 are the most conserved tryptophans in PfNapS-like family of proteins, and these residues align with Trp-103 and Trp-190 of PfNapL, respectively. Overall, these data suggested the possibility of small and subtle conformational changes in PfNapL and PfNapS.FIGURE 6Tryptophan fluorescence spectra of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated PfNapS (A) and PfNapL (B). Both PfNapS and PfNapL were phosphorylated with casein kinase II. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated proteins were recorded from 310 to 500 nm with excitation wavelength at 280 nm. Fluorescence intensities are the average of four scans. The spectra in bold are that of unphosphorylated proteins, and the spectra with the dotted line are of phosphorylated proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of Phosphorylation on the Interaction of Pf NapL and Pf NapS with Histones—Because both PfNapL and PfNapS can be phosphorylated by casein kinase II, we studied whether this modification had any effect on the histone binding and histone deposition properties of these proteins (Fig. 7). Although both PfNapS and PfNapL bound to the linker histone H1 with specificity, PfNapS binding to H1 was 3-fold higher than the PfNapL-H1 interaction. However, upon phosphorylation, PfNapL binding to H1, H3, and H4 increased 3–4-fold, whereas there was no significant difference in its binding to H2A and H2B (Fig. 7A). Because phosphorylated PfNapL showed increased binding with histone H3 and H4, we tested whether it was also capable of depositing histone tetramer and histone octamer onto DNA. Supercoiling assays indicated that phosphorylated PfNapL was still unable to deposit histones on DNA (data not shown). This suggested that the phosphorylation of PfNapL controlled only its histone binding affinity. The phosphorylation on PfNapS, however, did not have any observable effect on its interaction with histones or on its ability to mediate histone deposition (Fig. 7B). Given that phosphorylation enhances the PfNapL-histone interaction, we decided to probe for the conformational changes induced upon phosphorylation by mild proteolysis. The chymotrypsin digestion of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated PfNapL produced several polymorphic bands (Fig. 7C) suggesting the likelihood of small and subtle structural changes. As shown in Fig. 7C, bands 1 and 2 are protected after phosphorylation. There is also a partial protection of band 3 at all of the time points considered. Bands 4 and 5 appear to be protected in the unphosphorylated PfNapL state. Overall, chymotrypsin fingerprinting data hint at very small and subtle conformational changes in PfNapL upon phosphorylation. These changes may lead to a 3-fold enhanced PfNapL-histone interaction. Pf NapS Replaces Pf NapL on Histones—In our earlier experiments (Fig. 1D), we had demonstrated that when both PfNapS and PfNapL were present together, PfNapS had a higher affinity for histones than PfNapL, as judged by migrations of complexes on native gels. The proteins PfNapS and PfNapL did not interact with each other, as determined both by ELISA-based plate assays and native gel shifts. We addressed whether PfNapS was able to extract histones already bound to PfNapL (Fig. 8). When both PfNapS and PfNapL were incubated with histone octamers, most of the PfNapS was bound to histones, whereas there was negligible binding with PfNapL (Fig. 8, lane 2). Even when the histone octamer had been incubated with PfNapL (phosphorylated or unphosphorylated) 30 min prior to PfNapS addition, most of PfNapS was bound to histones, leaving Pf NapL free (Fig. 8, lanes 3 and 4). We then incubated phosphorylated Pf NapL with Pf NapS and allowed them to interact with core histones. This competition of PfNapS for histones was seen even in the presence of phosphorylated Pf NapL (Fig. 8, lane 4). The same effect was observed when phosphorylated PfNapL was incubated earlier with core histones before the addition of PfNapS (Fig. 8, lane 5). Therefore, these data together suggest that PfNapS was able to extract the histone oligomers from preformed histone-PfNapL complexes. We have analyzed in considerable detail the biochemical functions of the two nucleosome assembly proteins from P. falciparum. Our studies indicate that these proteins play distinct roles for the parasite. In addition to their previously characterized interactions with individual and oligomeric histones (1Chandra B.R. Olivieri A. Silvestrini F. Alano P. Sharma A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 142: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), in this study we demonstrate that PfNapS and PfNapL bind to the linker histone H1 as well. In Xenopus and HeLa cells, the H1-Nap1 complexes are integral for extraction of H1 from chromatin fibers, which results in an extended and transcriptionally active chromatin conformation (34Shintomi K.

Toth K.F. Rippe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34063-34072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Given the nuclear association of PfNapS (1Chandra B.R. Olivieri A. Silvestrini F. Alano P. Sharma A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 142: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), this protein is likely to have the ability to modulate gene expression like other H1 interacting histone chaperones (29Ohkuni K. Shirahige K. Kikuchi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The terminal subdomains of PfNapS appear to make critical contacts with H1 histone, as PfNap-HT bound to H1 with lesser affinity. The deletion of terminal subdomains of PfNapS, however, does not alter its binding to H3 or H4 histones, suggesting distinct sites of interaction for H1 versus H3/H4 on PfNapS. The protein PfNapS is able to deposit both histone tetramer and histone octamer on DNA, whereas PfNapL does not possess this activity. This property of PfNapS is consistent with its nuclear association in both asexual and sexual stages of the parasite life cycle, whereas PfNapL is predominantly cytoplasmic (1Chandra B.R. Olivieri A. Silvestrini F. Alano P. Sharma A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 142: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The deletion of PfNapS terminal subdomains does not effect its interaction with core histones but reduces its interaction with linker histone H1 and abolishes its ability to deposit core histones onto DNA. This suggests that the terminal subdomains of PfNapS are involved in the proper release of the core histones onto DNA. We propose that the acidic PfNapS C-terminal subdomain might assist in the ordered release of histones, which otherwise aggregate on DNA, by altering the histone release dynamics on DNA. Although PfNapS/PfNapL do not interact with each other, they do compete for histones, suggesting that same surfaces on histones maybe involved in binding to these proteins. This competition between PfNapS and PfNapL is likely to be determined by the relative strengths of Nap-histone interactions rather than by a direct cross-talk between PfNapS and PfNapL. Like other eukaryotic Nap proteins (23Dong A. Liu Z. Zhu Y. Yu F. Li Z. Cao K. Shen W.H. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 1446-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26Li M. Strand D. Krehan A.

Biol. 2000; 298: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the two P. falciparum Nap proteins are phosphorylated with casein kinase II. Similar to the case of human Nap2 (27Rodriguez P. Pelletier J. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the phosphorylation of PfNapS does not change its interaction with histones or its histone deposition activity. Casein kinase II-mediated phosphorylation is known to change the conformation of some proteins (36Penrose K.J. Garcia-Alai M. de Prat-Gay G. McBride A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22430-22439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 37Raha T. Samal E. Majumdar A. Basak S. Chattopadhyay D. Chattopadhyay D.J. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our data suggest the possibility of a very small and subtle structural change in PfNapL upon phosphorylation. The PfNapL residue Trp-103 is conserved in nucleosome assembly proteins from various organisms, whereas Trp-190 is very close to threonine 186, a putative casein kinase II phosphorylation site. Histone binding assays indicate that phosphorylated PfNapL has higher affinity for histones H1, H3, and H4 explaining the role of phosphorylation. Our experiments suggest that CK-II-mediated phosphorylation up-regulates PfNapL affinity for histones but does not impart histone deposition ability. However, the 3-fold increase in histone binding of PfNapL after phosphorylation has little effect on histone transfer dynamics. PfNapS precluded the binding of histones to PfNapL and could compete for histones already bound to both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated PfNapL, indicating its higher affinity for histones and its ability to extract the same from PfNapL (Fig. 8). PfNapS is able to disrupt the preformed PfNapL-histone complex, highlighting a potential relay of histones between PfNapL, PfNapS, and DNA. This idea is further strengthened by the fact that PfNapL is predominantly cytoplasmic, and PfNapS is essentially associated with the nucleus (1Chandra B.R. Olivieri A. Silvestrini F. Alano P. Sharma A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 142: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Taken together, this work provides evidence for a cellular pathway that the histone cargo can take in P. falciparum, from cytoplasm to the nucleus. We propose a model for the relay of histones by P. falciparum Nap proteins to summarize our results (Fig. 9). The cytoplasmic PfNapL binds to histones poorly in an unphosphorylated state, but CK-II phosphorylates PfNapL and increases the affinity of the PfNapL-histone interaction. This PfNapL-histone complex is readily broken down in the presence of PfNapS. The histone cargo is therefore offloaded from PfNapL to PfNapS by virtue of the higher affinity for histones displayed by PfNapS, which can then shuttle the PfNapS-histone complex to the nucleus. The translocation of this complex to the nucleus will then enable the deposition of histones onto DNA during the nucleosome assembly process. This would be followed by release of free PfNapS for subsequent cycling. Our observations highlighting the role of PfNapS in nucleosome assembly are further strengthened by the recent protein-protein interaction studies in P. falciparum, which show PfNapS as the part of chromatin remodeling complex and in direct interaction with ISWI (38Suthram S. Ideker T. SittlerT. Nature. 2005; 438: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), a protein that regulates transcription and chromatin assembly (39Corona D.F. Tamkun J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). ISWI is an ATPase and is part of multiple remodeling machines like NURF (nucleosome remodeling factor), ACF (ATP utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor), and CHRAC (chromatin accessibility complex) in higher eukaryotes (40Eberharter A. Becker P.B. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3707-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 41Johnson C.N. Adkins N.L. Georgel P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Nap proteins from other eukaryotes are shown to act in concert with ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factors (10Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 14Fyodorov D.V. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 499-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Lusser A. Urwin D.L. Kadonaga J.T. Na.t Struc.t Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Together, our analysis suggests that PfNapS-mediated histone deposition appears to be functioning along with the ATPases such as ISWI to produce uniformly spaced nucleosomes. It is to be noted that the yeast two-hybrid studies indicate that PfNapL is not part of the chromatin-remodeling complex, but instead it interacts with nine ribosomal proteins (42LaCount D.J. Vignali M. Chettier R. Phansalkar A. Bell R. Hesselberth J.R. Schoenfeld L.W. Ota I. Sahasrabudhe S. Kurschner C. Hughes R.E. FieldsS. Nature. 2005; 438: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). This is also consistent with our findings, which demonstrate that PfNapL cannot deposit histones on DNA, but it can interact with both core histones and linker histone H1. It is likely that PfNapL might be involved in binding to nascent chains of histones that come off the ribosomes and in their subsequent transfer to PfNapS. The occurrence of PXXP motifs in both PfNapS and PfNapL offers the opportunity for protein-protein interactions involving these two chaperones and components of chromatin/signaling networks (43Ravi Chandra B. Gowthaman R. Raj Akhouri R. Gupta D. Sharma A. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Further, the occurrence of acidic residue homorepeats in PfNap proteins seems to be functionally relevant to the histone binding dynamics and in this case may not reflect the amino acid composition peculiarities of P. falciparum proteins (31Singh G.P. Chandra B.R. Bhattacharya A. Akhouri R.R. Singh S.K. Sharma A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 137: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In summary, our data suggest a distinct and non-overlapping functional roles for P. falciparum NapS and NapL proteins in chromatin assembly and histone transport, respectively. The elucidation of additional protein motors involved in chromatin organization is necessary for greater understanding of the cellular networks that maintain chromatin structure within the parasite.

Based on studies with recombinant α2M fragments expressed in bacteria and synthetic peptides, we previously localized a growth factor-binding site near the center of the α2M subunit. However, because intact α2M forms a hollow cylinder structure, an alternative model for growth factor binding involves nonspecific entrapment within the α2M core. To distinguish between these two models, we engineered mutations in the putative growth factor binding sequence of full-length α2M. These mutations did not perturb the tetrameric structure of α2M, reaction with proteases, the thiol ester bonds, or binding to LRP-1. A single mutation (E730R) completely blocked binding of platelet-derived growth factor-BB to intact α2M. E730R did not alter TGF-β1 binding; however, this mutation in combination with mutations at Glu714 and Asp719 eliminated the increase in TGF-β1 binding associated with α2M conformational change. These studies demonstrate that growth factor binding to intact α2M is specific, involving a defined region of the α2M subunit. The exact sequences required for binding different growth factors may be non-identical, mimicking the model of the bait region in which different proteases target adjacent and sometimes overlapping sequences. α2-Macroglobulin (α2M) inhibits diverse extracellular proteases, binds growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), and carries β-amyloid peptide. α2M may also trigger cell signaling by binding to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP-1) and/or other cell surface receptors.

Wollenberg G.K. Gonias S.L. Hayes M.A. Lab. Investig. 1991; 65: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar). Proteases react with α2M by cleaving any of a number of target peptide bonds near the center of the α2M subunit, in the “bait region” (2Barrett A.J. Starkey P.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Cleavage in the bait region induces a major conformational change in α2M that entraps the reacting protease within the hollow core of the cylindrical α2M structure (2Barrett A.J. Starkey P.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 3Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Sayers C.A. Biochem. J. 1979; 181: 401-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 4Gonias S.L. Exp. Hematol. 1992; 20: 302-311PubMed Google Scholar). α2M conformational change reveals the recognition site for the α2M receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP-1), which is cryptic in the native α2M conformation (5Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Nykjaer A. Andreasen P.A. Rasmussen H.H. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 17401-17404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, conformationally transformed α2M is referred to as “activated.” α2M thiol ester bonds, which are formed by the side chains of Cys949 and Glu952, also become exposed during α2M conformational change and may react with lysine residues of the attacking protease to form covalent linkages; however, these linkages are not necessary to stabilize the α2M-protease complex because the trapping mechanism is essentially irreversible under physiological conditions (7Feinman R.D. Wang D. Windwer S.R. Wu K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 421: 178-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 8Salvesen G.S. Sayers C.A. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). α2M conformational change may be induced in the absence of proteases by aminolysis of the thiol ester bonds with small primary amines such as methylamine (MA) (9Bjork I. Fish W.W. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Gonias S.L. Reynolds J.A. Pizzo S.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 705: 306-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). One growth factor reported to interact with α2M is platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a potent stimulator of mesenchymal cell mitogenesis and chemotaxis and a regulator of inflammation and wound healing in vivo (11Meyer-Ingold W. Eichner W. Cell Biol. Int. 1995; 19: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Biologically active PDGF is formed by homodimerization of A-chains or B-chains or by heterodimerization of the A- and B-chains to form PDGF-AB (11Meyer-Ingold W. Eichner W. Cell Biol. Int. 1995; 19: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently, PDGF C-chains and D-chains also have been described (12Fredriksson L. Li H. Eriksson U. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The PDGFs mediate biological activities by binding to the PDGF α-receptor or β-receptor; the specificity of this interaction is dictated by the subunit composition of the PDGF (12Fredriksson L. Li H. Eriksson U. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The interaction of PDGF with α2M was first discovered by analysis of PDGF carrier proteins in the plasma (13Huang J.S. Huang S.S. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 14Raines E.W. Bowen-Pope D.F. Ross R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3424-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrated binding of purified PDGF-BB and PDGF-AB to α2M, but not PDGF-AA (15Bonner J.C. Osornio-Vargas A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16236-16242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The interaction of PDGF-BB with α2M blocks PDGF-BB binding to its receptor (16Bonner J.C. Badgett A. Hoffman M. Lindroos P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6389-6395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Gonias S.L. Carmichael A. Mettenburg J.M. Roadcap D.W. Irvin W.P. Webb D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5826-5831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). TGF-β binding to α2M was also originally discovered by analysis of TGF-β carrier proteins in the plasma (18O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Wakefield L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14090-14099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because TGF-β in complex with α2M lacks biological activity, the complex was originally referred to as “latent complex,” a term now reserved for the secreted complex in which TGF-β retains its pro-region, the latency-associated peptide, and binds latent TGF-β-binding protein (19Taipale J. Saharinen J. Keski-Oja J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 87-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like PDGF, growth factors in the TGF-β family regulate inflammation and the response to injury (20Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3986) Google Scholar). These factors are also involved in development (20Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3986) Google Scholar). The latent TGF-β complex, which is released from cells, may be dissociated by proteases, chaotropic agents, or decreases in pH, yielding active growth factor (21Annes J.P. Munger J.S. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). Because liberated active TGF-β associates rapidly with native α2M, which is not LRP-1 recognized, the TGF-β is stabilized against renal clearance and may be reversibly released at sites of tissue remodeling or inflammation (18O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Wakefield L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14090-14099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of TGF-β1 and PDGF-BB is regulated by α2M conformational change; both growth factors bind with higher affinity to α2M that is activated by methylamine or by proteases (22Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gonias S.L. LaMarre J. Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Lopes M.B. Moses H.L. Hayes M.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 273-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). When native α2M and various forms of activated α2M are denatured, TGF-β1 binding becomes equivalent, confirming the role of α2M conformation in determining growth factor binding affinity (17Gonias S.L. Carmichael A. Mettenburg J.M. Roadcap D.W. Irvin W.P. Webb D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5826-5831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Webb D.J. Wen J. Karns L.R.

Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1986-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The ability of α2Mto bind growth factors after denaturation also suggests that linear sequences in the structure of α2M may be responsible for the observed interaction. To identify candidate growth factor-binding sites in the structure of α2M, we screened a library of overlapping glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and defined a binding site for TGF-β1 between amino acids 700 and 738 in the mature α2M subunit (24Webb D.J. Wen J. Karns L.R. Kurilla M.G. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13339-13346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Webb D.J. Roadcap D.W. Dhakephalkar A. Gonias S.L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1986-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins containing the same sequence also bound PDGF-BB and nerve growth factor-β, suggesting that these binding sites may be identical or overlapping (17Gonias S.L. Carmichael A. Mettenburg J.M. Roadcap D.W. Irvin W.P. Webb D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5826-5831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In subsequent studies, we screened synthetic peptides and further narrowed a putative binding site for TGF-β and PDGF-BB to between amino acids 714 and 733 (25Webb D.J. Roadcap D.W. Dhakephalkar A. Gonias S.L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1986-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Arandjelovic S. Freed T.A. Gonias S.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6121-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The growth factor binding peptides were notable for their high content of hydrophobic and negatively charged residues. Importantly, the peptides blocked binding of TGF-β1 to its receptors, suggesting that the peptides and receptors bind to equivalent or overlapping sites on the growth factor surface (26Arandjelovic S. Freed T.A. Gonias S.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6121-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Genetic engineering studies with full-length recombinant α2M (rα2M) have contributed considerably to our understanding of the structure and function of this protein. When Cys949 is mutated to serine, precluding formation of thiol esters, α2M is expressed in its conformationally transformed state (27Gettins P.G. Boel E. Crews B.C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Mutation of Asn1065 also alters thiol ester formation and its reaction with nucleophiles (28Suda S.A. Dolmer K. Gettins P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31107-31112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Truncation of the α2M bait region yields α2M variants incapable of protease entrapment and induces defects in subunit association (29Gettins P.G. Hahn K.H. Crews B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14160-14167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Finally, mutagenesis studies targeting the LRP-1 recognition sequence demonstrated an essential role for Lys1370 but not Lys1374 (30Arandjelovic S. Hall B.D. Gonias S.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 438: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although work with GST fusion proteins and synthetic peptides provided evidence regarding the potential location of a growth factor binding sequence in the structure of α2M, a pitfall in the use of this strategy involved the possibility that the discovered sequence is cryptic in full-length α2M. This concern was heightened by the highly hydrophobic nature of the identified sequence. Given what is known about the structure of MA-modified α2M, which approximates the shape of a hollow cylinder with a substantial internal cavity, an alternative hypothesis regarding growth factor binding might involve nonspecific entrapment within the α2M central core. Thus, to validate the results of our experiments with GST fusion proteins and synthetic peptides, it was necessary to reproduce the results in intact α2M. In this study, we expressed full-length rα2M and three mutated forms of rα2M in which acidic amino acids in the putative growth factor-binding site were subjected to charge reversal. We chose charge reversal as opposed to the more conventional approach of alanine mutagenesis to avoid possible collapse of what we hypothesized was already a highly hydrophobic surface patch in the structure of α2M. The mutated forms of rα2M included rα2M(E730R), rα2M(E714R,D719R), and rα2M(E714R,D719R,E730R). We have demonstrated that PDGF-BB binding is entirely eliminated in rα2M(E730R). TGF-β1 binding is not totally blocked by any of these three mutations; however, the substantial increase in TGF-β1 binding that accompanies conversion of α2M to the MA-transformed conformation is eliminated in rα2M(E714R,D719R,E730R). These studies have demonstrated that growth factor binding to α2M reflects a specific interaction involving defined amino acids within the α2M structure. Binding of different growth factors may involve non-identical but overlapping sites. Reagents—TGF-β1 and PDGF-BB were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).

Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, RPMI 1640, and trypsin-EDTA were from Invitrogen. Trypsin was purchased from Worthington (Lakewood, NJ). The concentration of trypsin was determined by active site titration with p-nitrophenyl p′-guanidino benzoate (31Chase Jr., T. Shaw E. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2212-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Trypsin was radioiodinated with IODO-BEADS (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 125I-Trypsin was collected by gel filtration into 1 mm HCl for storage. TGF-β1 and PDGF-BB were radioiodinated according to the procedure of Ruff and Rizzino (32Ruff E. Rizzino A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). 125I-TGF-β1 and 125I-PDGF-BB were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography to confirm integrity and stored at 4 °C for no longer than 2 weeks. The specific activity of 125I-TGF-β1 was 100–200 μCi/μg. The specific activity of 125I-PDGF-BB was 3–5 μCi/μg. Human α2 M—α2M was purified from outdated human plasma according to the method of Imber and Pizzo (33Imber M.J. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8134-8139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of α2M was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and the concentration determined by the absorbance at 280 nm using an A1%, 1.0 cm of 8.93 (34Hall P.K. Roberts R.C. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To form MA-activated α2M, native α2M was dialyzed against 200 mm MA in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.2, overnight at 22 °C, followed by extensive dialysis against 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (PBS) at 4 °C. Reaction of native α2M with MA was confirmed by the characteristic increase in electrophoretic mobility in nondenaturing PAGE (9Bjork I. Fish W.W. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Gonias S.L. Reynolds J.A. Pizzo S.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 705: 306-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The full-length human α2M cDNA in pAT153 (24Webb D.J. Wen J. Karns L.R. Kurilla M.G. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13339-13346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was cloned into the expression vector, pSecTag2/Hygro, from Invitrogen. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutated forms of rα2M, including rα2M(E730R); rα2M(E714R,D719R), also called rα2M(RR); and rα2M(E714R,D719R,E730R), also called rα2M(RRR), were confirmed by sequence analysis. K-562 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. K-562 cells do not express detectable levels of endogenous α2M, as previously described (30Arandjelovic S. Hall B.D. Gonias S.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 438: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Constructs encoding wild-type rα2M and the various mutated forms of rα2M were transfected by electroporation (270 V, 1180 μF) into 5 × 106 K-562 cells. The cells were selected in 200 μg/ml of Hygromycin-B (Invitrogen) and single cell cloned to identify high expressing cells. Rα2M expression and secretion into serum-free medium were determined by immunoblot analysis, using polyclonal rabbit anti-human α2M IgG from DAKO (Carpinteria, CA). rα2Ms were purified from conditioned medium by the method of Imber and Pizzo (33Imber M.J. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8134-8139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed as described for plasma α2M (34Hall P.K. Roberts R.C. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). MA-activated rα2Ms were radioiodinated using IODO-BEADS. The specific activity of 125I-rα2M(RRR) was 1–5 μCi/μg. Analysis of rα2M Structural Integrity and Conformational Change—In plasma-derived α2M, the four subunits are linked into pairs by disulfide bonds and into intact tetramers by noncovalent interactions (3Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Sayers C.A. Biochem. J. 1979; 181: 401-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). To assess subunit integrity and the pattern of disulfide bonds, wild-type and mutated forms of rα2M were subjected to SDS-PAGE. In some experiments, rα2M variants were treated with a 2-fold molar excess of active trypsin for 2 min. Reactions were terminated with p-nitrophenyl p′-guanidino benzoate and the products analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In plasma-derived α2M, trypsin cleaves only the bait region, converting the 180-kDa subunits into 90-kDa products (3Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Sayers C.A. Biochem. J. 1979; 181: 401-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). To assess rα2M conformational change in response to trypsin or MA, samples were subjected to nondenaturing PAGE on 5% slabs, according to the method of Van Leuven et al. (35Van Leuven F. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9016-9022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteases and MA induce nearly identical conformational change in plasma α2M (9Bjork I. Fish W.W. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Gonias S.L. Reynolds J.A. Pizzo S.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 705: 306-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Direct binding of trypsin to plasma-derived α2M, wild-type rα2M, and mutated forms of rα2M was determined using 125I-trypsin. Each α2M derivative was incubated with a 2-fold molar excess of 125I-trypsin for 2 min at 22 °C. Samples were subjected to nondenaturing PAGE and autoradiography to detect radio-iodinated trypsin co-migrating with α2M. In control experiments, we demonstrated that free 125I-trypsin does not migrate near the mobility of α2M. α2 M Receptor Binding Experiments—RAW 264.7 cells were obtained from the ATCC and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity. For receptor binding experiments, cells were plated at 5 × 105/well in 24-well plates and cultured until nearly confluent. The cells were then washed twice with Earles balanced salt solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1.0 mg/ml BSA (EHB) and equilibrated in the same solution. MA-activated 125I-rα2M(RRR) (0.1–5.0 nm) was incubated with cells for 4 h at 4 °C, alone or in the presence of nonradiolabeled MA-activated plasma-derived α2M (0.2 μm). The wells were washed two times with EHB and once with Earles balanced salt solution. Cell extracts were prepared in 0.1 m NaOH, 1.0% SDS. Cell-associated radioactivity was determined in a 1470 Wizard Gamma Counter (PerkinElmer). Cellular protein was measured by bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma). Specific binding was then determined as the fraction of total binding that was inhibited by the nonradiolabeled MA-activated plasma α2M (typically 75–95%). Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate. Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression, comparing single-site and two-site models. Analysis of PDGF-BB Binding to α2 M—125I-PDGF-BB (5 nm) was incubated with native or MA-activated plasma α2M, wild-type rα2M, or mutated forms of rα2M (0.1 μm) in PBS containing 15 μm BSA for 60 min at 37 °C. Samples were subjected to nondenaturing PAGE for 1 h at 150 V. 125I-PDGF-BB binding to α2M was determined by autoradiography. In control experiments, we demonstrated that free 125I-PDGF-BB does not migrate near α2M. We also analyzed 125I-PDGF-BB binding to α2M by co-immunoprecipitation. Various concentrations of MA-activated plasma α2M or rα2M(E730R) were coupled to rabbit anti-human α2M polyclonal antibody immobilized on Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The coupling time was 1 h at 22°C. The beads were washed and then incubated with 125I-PDGF-BB (1 nm) for 1 h at 37°C in PBS with 1 mg/ml of BSA. The beads were washed three times again, and the amount of 125I-PDGF-BB associated with the beads was determined by measuring radioactivity in a γ counter. Some of the beads were treated with SDS sample buffer under reducing conditions to dissociate immunoprecipitated proteins. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the gels were Coomassie stained and dried. Autoradiography was performed to detect 125I-PDGF-BB. As a control, 125I-PDGF-BB was incubated with α2M-specific antibody coupled to Protein A-Sepharose in the absence of α2M. Nonspecific binding was subtracted as background. As a third method to study 125I-PDGF-BB binding to α2M, we applied a cross-linking strategy. MA-activated plasma α2M and rα2M(E730R) (0.1 μm) were incubated with 125I-PDGF-BB for 1 h at 37°C in PBS with 1 mg/ml of BSA. The samples were then divided in two. One aliquot was denatured in SDS without further modification, so that only covalent interactions were preserved. The other aliquot was treated with the homobifunctional cross-linker BS3 (5 mm) for 1 min. Pulse exposure to BS3 covalently stabilizes a fraction of the non-covalent PDGF-BB-α2M complex. Because BS3 is reacted with the protein mixture under pseudo first-order conditions, the fraction of covalently stabilized α2M-PDGF-BB complex is constant and independent of the total amount of non-covalent complex (22Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking was terminated by acidification with HCl and immediate addition of buffered SDS (2.0% v/v). Samples were subjected to 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and dried. Autoradiography was performed to detect 125I-PDGF-BB in association with α2 M. PDGF Receptor Phosphorylation—Murine embryonic fibroblasts from wild-type C57/BL6 mice were seeded in 12-well tissue culture plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and cultured until nearly confluent. The cultures were washed three times with PBS and then serum starved for 18 h. Cells were treated for 10 min at 37 °C with PDGF-BB (2 ng/ml), plasma α2M (1 μm), rα2M(E730R) (1 μm), PDGF-BB plus plasma rα2M, or PDGF-BB plus rα2M(E730R). The α2M was MA activated. When PDGF-BB and the various forms of α2M were added to the same cultures, the two proteins were preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Treated cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and extracted in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins using the mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody from BD Biosciences. As a control for load, extracts were immunoblotted for total ERK1/2 using the rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK1/2 antibody from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). Analysis of TGF-β1 Binding to α2 M—125I-TGF-β1(1nm) was incubated with native or MA-activated plasma α2M, wild-type rα2M, and mutated forms of rα2M (0.1 μm) in PBS containing 15 μm BSA for 60 min at 37 °C. Samples were subjected to nondenaturing PAGE for 1 h at 150 V. 125I-TGF-β1 binding to α2M was determined by autoradiography. In control experiments, we demonstrated that free 125I-TGF-β1 does not migrate near α2M. TGF-β1 binding to α2M in solution was also determined by competition for binding to immobilized MA-activated plasma-derived α2Mas previously described (36Webb D.J. Crookston K.P. Hall S.W. Gonias S.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Plasma α2M (1.0 μgin100 μl) was incubated in each well of 96-well microtiter plates for 4 h at 22 °C. This procedure results in immobilization of ∼90 fmol α2M (36Webb D.J. Crookston K.P. Hall S.W. Gonias S.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The wells were washed three times with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and blocked with PBST for 16 h at 4 °C. As a control, some wells were blocked with PBST without first immobilizing α2M. 125I-TGF-β1 (0.1 nm) was incubated with the immobilized α2M in the presence of 15 μm BSA and 250 nm native or MA-activated plasma α2M or rα2M (RRR) for 1 h at 22°C. The wells were then washed three times with PBST. 125I-TGF-β1 that was associated with the immobilized phase was recovered in 0.1 m NaOH, 2% SDS and quantitated in a γ-counter. Analysis of Mutated Forms of rα2 M—We previously localized a specific region in the α2M subunit that includes putative binding sites for several growth factors, including TGF-β1, PDGF-BB, and nerve growth factor-β (24Webb D.J. Wen J. Karns L.R. Kurilla M.G. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13339-13346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Webb D.J. Roadcap D.W. Dhakephalkar A. Gonias S.L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1986-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We refer to this site as “protein interaction domain 1” (PID-1); however, the strict definition of “domain” may not apply. Fig. 1 shows the relationship of PID-1, in the primary sequence of the α2M subunit, to other functional domains. The second non-covalent protein interaction domain (PID-2) serves as a binding site for β-amyloid peptide (37Mettenburg J.M. Webb D.J. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13338-133"
