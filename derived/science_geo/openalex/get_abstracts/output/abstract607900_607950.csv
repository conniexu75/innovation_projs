https://openalex.org/W2794480084,"Computational single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) methods have been successfully applied to experiments representing a single condition, technology, or species to discover and define cellular phenotypes. However, identifying subpopulations of cells that are present across multiple data sets remains challenging. Here, we introduce an analytical strategy for integrating scRNA-seq data sets based on common sources of variation, enabling the identification of shared populations across data sets and downstream comparative analysis. We apply this approach, implemented in our R toolkit Seurat (http://satijalab.org/seurat/), to align scRNA-seq data sets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells under resting and stimulated conditions, hematopoietic progenitors sequenced using two profiling technologies, and pancreatic cell 'atlases' generated from human and mouse islets. In each case, we learn distinct or transitional cell states jointly across data sets, while boosting statistical power through integrated analysis. Our approach facilitates general comparisons of scRNA-seq data sets, potentially deepening our understanding of how distinct cell states respond to perturbation, disease, and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2794521141,"Differences in gene expression between individual cells of the same type are measured across batches and used to correct technical artifacts in single-cell RNA-sequencing data. Large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data sets that are produced in different laboratories and at different times contain batch effects that may compromise the integration and interpretation of the data. Existing scRNA-seq analysis methods incorrectly assume that the composition of cell populations is either known or identical across batches. We present a strategy for batch correction based on the detection of mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs) in the high-dimensional expression space. Our approach does not rely on predefined or equal population compositions across batches; instead, it requires only that a subset of the population be shared between batches. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with existing methods by using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data sets. Using multiple droplet-based scRNA-seq data sets, we demonstrate that our MNN batch-effect-correction method can be scaled to large numbers of cells."
https://openalex.org/W2795331645,"The lineage relationships among the hundreds of cell types generated during development are difficult to reconstruct. A recent method, GESTALT, used CRISPR-Cas9 barcode editing for large-scale lineage tracing, but was restricted to early development and did not identify cell types. Here we present scGESTALT, which combines the lineage recording capabilities of GESTALT with cell-type identification by single-cell RNA sequencing. The method relies on an inducible system that enables barcodes to be edited at multiple time points, capturing lineage information from later stages of development. Sequencing of ∼60,000 transcriptomes from the juvenile zebrafish brain identified >100 cell types and marker genes. Using these data, we generate lineage trees with hundreds of branches that help uncover restrictions at the level of cell types, brain regions, and gene expression cascades during differentiation. scGESTALT can be applied to other multicellular organisms to simultaneously characterize molecular identities and lineage histories of thousands of cells during development and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2795328021,"Fetal hemoglobin (HbF, α2γ2) level is genetically controlled and modifies severity of adult hemoglobin (HbA, α2β2) disorders, sickle cell disease, and β-thalassemia. Common genetic variation affects expression of BCL11A, a regulator of HbF silencing. To uncover how BCL11A supports the developmental switch from γ- to β- globin, we use a functional assay and protein binding microarray to establish a requirement for a zinc-finger cluster in BCL11A in repression and identify a preferred DNA recognition sequence. This motif appears in embryonic and fetal-expressed globin promoters and is duplicated in γ-globin promoters. The more distal of the duplicated motifs is mutated in individuals with hereditary persistence of HbF. Using the CUT&RUN approach to map protein binding sites in erythroid cells, we demonstrate BCL11A occupancy preferentially at the distal motif, which can be disrupted by editing the promoter. Our findings reveal that direct γ-globin gene promoter repression by BCL11A underlies hemoglobin switching."
https://openalex.org/W2794937040,"Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by preferential loss of the medium spiny neurons in the striatum. Using CRISPR/Cas9 and somatic nuclear transfer technology, we established a knockin (KI) pig model of HD that endogenously expresses full-length mutant huntingtin (HTT). By breeding this HD pig model, we have successfully obtained F1 and F2 generation KI pigs. Characterization of founder and F1 KI pigs shows consistent movement, behavioral abnormalities, and early death, which are germline transmittable. More importantly, brains of HD KI pig display striking and selective degeneration of striatal medium spiny neurons. Thus, using a large animal model of HD, we demonstrate for the first time that overt and selective neurodegeneration seen in HD patients can be recapitulated by endogenously expressed mutant proteins in large mammals, a finding that also underscores the importance of using large mammals to investigate the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and their therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2795230881,"Fusion is thought to open a pore to release vesicular cargoes vital for many biological processes, including exocytosis, intracellular trafficking, fertilization, and viral entry. However, fusion pores have not been observed and thus proved in live cells. Its regulatory mechanisms and functions remain poorly understood. With super-resolution STED microscopy, we observed dynamic fusion pore behaviors in live (neuroendocrine) cells, including opening, expansion, constriction, and closure, where pore size may vary between 0 and 490 nm within 26 milliseconds to seconds (vesicle size: 180-720 nm). These pore dynamics crucially determine the efficiency of vesicular cargo release and vesicle retrieval. They are generated by competition between pore expansion and constriction. Pharmacology and mutation experiments suggest that expansion and constriction are mediated by F-actin-dependent membrane tension and calcium/dynamin, respectively. These findings provide the missing live-cell evidence, proving the fusion-pore hypothesis, and establish a live-cell dynamic-pore theory accounting for fusion, fission, and their regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2794779684,"Systems-level organization in spontaneous infra-slow (<0.1Hz) brain activity, measured using blood oxygen signals in fMRI and optical imaging, has become a major theme in the study of neural function in both humans and animal models. Yet the neurophysiological basis of infra-slow activity (ISA) remains unresolved. In particular, is ISA a distinct physiological process, or is it a low-frequency analog of faster neural activity? Here, using whole-cortex calcium/hemoglobin imaging in mice, we show that ISA in each of these modalities travels through the cortex along stereotypical spatiotemporal trajectories that are state dependent (wake versus anesthesia) and distinct from trajectories in delta (1-4 Hz) activity. Moreover, mouse laminar electrophysiology reveals that ISA travels through specific cortical layers and is organized into unique cross-laminar temporal dynamics that are different from higher frequency local field potential activity. These findings suggest that ISA is a distinct neurophysiological process that is reflected in fMRI blood oxygen signals."
https://openalex.org/W2794878499,"Summary Coexpression of proteins in response to pathway-inducing signals is the founding paradigm of gene regulation. However, it remains unexplored whether the relative abundance of co-regulated proteins requires precise tuning. Here, we present large-scale analyses of protein stoichiometry and corresponding regulatory strategies for 21 pathways and 67–224 operons in divergent bacteria separated by 0.6–2 billion years. Using end-enriched RNA-sequencing (Rend-seq) with single-nucleotide resolution, we found that many bacterial gene clusters encoding conserved pathways have undergone massive divergence in transcript abundance and architectures via remodeling of internal promoters and terminators. Remarkably, these evolutionary changes are compensated post-transcriptionally to maintain preferred stoichiometry of protein synthesis rates. Even more strikingly, in eukaryotic budding yeast, functionally analogous proteins that arose independently from bacterial counterparts also evolved to convergent in-pathway expression. The broad requirement for exact protein stoichiometries despite regulatory divergence provides an unexpected principle for building biological pathways both in nature and for synthetic activities."

Astrocytes (AS) carry out general functions in the central nervous system (CNS), including blood-brain barrier formation, regulation of synaptogenesis, and the maintenance of metabolic, ionic, and neurotransmitter homeostasis (Allen, 2014Allen N.J.

Because AS are pervasive throughout the CNS and their processes tile within domains, they are key environmental determinants for neural circuits. We have proposed that regionally diversified AS could become “optimized” to enhance local function (Freeman and Rowitch, 2013Freeman M.R. Rowitch D.H.

Coordination of voluntary movement is complex and requires diversified motor neuron (MN) subtypes that form region- and muscle-specific interactions (Kanning et al., 2010Kanning K.C. Kaplan A.

However, the relationship between local AS specialization, neuron subtype selective support, and neural circuit function remains poorly understood. Spinal cord αMNs fall into two broad classes along the anterior posterior axis. Slow αMNs (SαMNs) innervate type I muscle fibers and generate fatigue-resistant, low-force contractions while fast αMNs (FαMNs) project to type II fast-fatigable muscle fibers and produce brief, but high force outputs (Burke et al., 1971Burke R.E.

Gamma MNs (γMNs) innervate muscle spindles to ensure proper muscle fiber tension. The morphological, transcriptional, and biophysical properties of these MN subtypes match their corresponding muscle contractile properties (Henneman, 1957Henneman E.

FαMNs are larger in size, are activated at higher thresholds, and fire action potentials in high-frequency bursts that are readily distinguishable from SαMNs (Hadzipasic et al., 2014Hadzipasic M. Tahvildari B. Nagy M. Bian M. Horwich A.L. McCormick D.A. Selective degeneration of a physiological subtype of spinal motor neuron in mice with SOD1-linked ALS.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 16883-16888Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness and paralysis resulting from MN death (Cleveland and Rothstein, 2001Cleveland D.W. Rothstein J.D. From Charcot to Lou Gehrig: deciphering selective motor neuron death in ALS.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). Although the majority of cases are sporadic, familial forms of ALS have provided insight into genetic causes of the disease (Robberecht and Philips, 2013Robberecht W. Philips T. The changing scene of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 248-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Of these, constitutive mutations of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) (Rosen, 1993Rosen D.R. Mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase gene are associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Nature. 1993; 364: 362Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have been the most extensively studied and are sufficient to cause clinical symptoms and MN death in rodent models (Philips and Rothstein, 2015Philips T. Rothstein J.D. Rodent models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Curr. Protocols Pharmacol. 2015; 69 (21): 1-21Google Scholar). FαMNs innervating fast-fatigable muscle fibers are selectively vulnerable in ALS (Saxena and Caroni, 2011Saxena S. Caroni P. Selective neuronal vulnerability in neurodegenerative diseases: from stressor thresholds to degeneration.Neuron. 2011; 71: 35-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In SOD1G93A transgenic ALS mice, these MNs display early transcriptional alterations and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Saxena et al., 2009Saxena S. Cabuy E. Caroni P. A role for motoneuron subtype-selective ER stress in disease manifestations of FALS mice.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) and selectively express matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), which regulates FαMN survival and disease progression (Kaplan et al., 2014Kaplan A. Spiller K.J. Towne C. Kanning K.C. Choe G.T. Geber A. Akay T. Aebischer P. Henderson C.E. Neuronal matrix metalloproteinase-9 is a determinant of selective neurodegeneration.Neuron. 2014; 81: 333-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Indeed, FαMN cell death in ALS is generally thought to cause loss of peak strength and clinical decline in both rodent models and human patients (Kanning et al., 2010Kanning K.C. Kaplan A.

Neurosci. 2006; 9: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). MN death in ALS also involves non-cell-autonomous mechanisms due to glial cell dysfunction (Lobsiger and Cleveland, 2007Lobsiger C.S. Cleveland D.W. Glial cells as intrinsic components of non-cell-autonomous neurodegenerative disease.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1355-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). For instance, selective removal of SOD1G37R in microglia (Boillée et al., 2006Boillée S. Yamanaka K. Lobsiger C.S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Kassiotis G. Kollias G. Cleveland D.W. Onset and progression in inherited ALS determined by motor neurons and microglia.Science. 2006; 312: 1389-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar), oligodendrocyte precursor cells (Kang et al., 2013Kang S.H.

Neurosci. 2013; 16: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), and AS (Yamanaka et al., 2008Yamanaka K. Chun S.J. Boillee S. Fujimori-Tonou N. Yamashita H. Gutmann D.H. Takahashi R. Misawa H. Cleveland D.W. Astrocytes as determinants of disease progression in inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 251-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) slowed disease progression, suggesting that mutant SOD1 is detrimental to glial cell functions. Is there a role for local ventral horn AS to selectively maintain the physiological properties and function of MN subtypes, and is this role disrupted in ALS? We have previously shown that ventral horn AS-encoded function of Sema3a is essential for the survival of αMNs (Molofsky et al., 2014Molofsky A.V. Kelley K.W. Tsai H.H. Redmond S.A. Chang S.M.

Astrocyte-encoded positional cues maintain sensorimotor circuit integrity.Nature. 2014; 509: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Here, we focused on the astrocytic inward-rectifying K+ channel Kir4.1 (a.k.a. Kcnj10), which is selectively enriched in ventral compared to dorsal spinal cord AS (Olsen et al., 2007Olsen M.L. Campbell S.L. Sontheimer H. Differential distribution of Kir4.1 in spinal cord astrocytes suggests regional differences in K+ homeostasis.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 98: 786-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 are the major inward-rectifying K+ channels expressed in AS and are important for K+ homeostasis, establishing the characteristic high resting K+ current and setting AS resting membrane potential (Djukic et al., 2007Djukic B.

Neurochem. 2006; 99: 900-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), raising the question of whether such dysregulation is pathological or maladaptive. Here, we report that AS Kir4.1 is specifically required to maintain functional properties—but not survival—of FαMN populations in the mouse spinal cord. AS Kir4.1 expression surrounding FαMNs was developmentally upregulated in a VGLUT1-dependent manner. Conditional knockout (cKO) of AS-encoded Kir4.1 (AS-Kir4.1cKO) led to a highly selective and pervasive reduction in FαMN size and characteristic electrophysiological properties. AS-Kir4.1cKO animals showed decreased fast-twitch muscle fiber size and peak strength. In contrast, SαMNs and γMNs showed no detectable abnormalities. Viral overexpression of Kir4.1 in AS was sufficient to increase both FαMN and SαMN soma size through activation of the PI3K/mTOR/pS6 pathway. In cultured AS derived from ALS patient-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we observed significant reduction of KIR4.1 (KCNJ10) expression, suggesting that ALS-associated SOD1 mutation causes cell-autonomous downregulation of KIR4.1. Because AS Kir4.1 was dispensable for FαMN survival even in the mutant SOD1 ALS mice, we conclude that its function is required to maintain peak strength, FαMN cellular, and biophysical properties, but not MN survival. Collectively, these results suggest that clinical loss of peak strength in ALS could signify downregulation of AS Kir4.1 expression and therefore be uncoupled from FαMN cell death. To identify regions with the highest Kir4.1 expression levels, we analyzed mRNA expression profiling data from human (GTEx Consortium, 2015GTEx ConsortiumHuman genomics.

The spinal cord has well-defined organization in the dorsoventral (DV) axis with MNs located in the ventral horn (Figures 1C and 1D). Kir4.1 showed marked expression in ventral gray matter as compared to dorsal horn in human (Figure 1C; Table S1) and mouse (Figures 1D and 1E) spinal cord. In mice, Kir4.1 was enriched in ventral versus dorsal AS in both cultured and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified AS from Aldh1l1-GFP mice (Cahoy et al., 2008Cahoy J.D. Emery B.

Regulated temporal-spatial astrocyte precursor cell proliferation involves BRAF signalling in mammalian spinal cord.Development. 2012; 139: 2477-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (Figure 1F). We determined the cell-type contributions to Kir4.1 expression in the mouse spinal cord using Aldh1l1-GFP mice to label AS along with markers of oligodendrocytes and neurons. We found an 8-fold enrichment of Kir4.1 mRNA in FACS-isolated AS compared to non-AS (Figure 1G), consistent with mRNA expression profiling data from human and mouse cortex (Figures S1A and S1B). Kir4.1 was also expressed in approximately 30% of gray matter oligodendrocytes in the ventral horn, but not in NeuN+ or choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)+ neurons (Figure 1D; Figures S1C and S1D). Using MMP-9 as a marker of FαMNs (Kaplan et al., 2014Kaplan A. Spiller K.J. Towne C. Kanning K.C. Choe G.T. Geber A. Akay T. Aebischer P. Henderson C.E. Neuronal matrix metalloproteinase-9 is a determinant of selective neurodegeneration.Neuron. 2014; 81: 333-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), we observed a graded expression pattern of Kir4.1 with highest levels surrounding MMP-9+ FαMNs as compared to MMP-9− SαMNs (Figures 1H and 1I). As Kir4.1 function is related to synaptic activity (Cheung et al., 2015Cheung G. Sibille J. Zapata J. Rouach N. Activity-dependent plasticity of astroglial potassium and glutamate clearance.Neural Plast. 2015; 2015: 109106Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and neuronal signaling regulates the expression levels of other AS transporters (Muthukumar et al., 2014Muthukumar A.K.

Won Park J. et al.Presynaptic regulation of astroglial excitatory neurotransmitter transporter GLT1.Neuron. 2009; 61: 880-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), we investigated Kir4.1 expression in relation to the excitatory presynaptic terminal markers VGLUT1 (Figures S2A–S2D) and VGLUT2 (Figure S2E) in the developing mouse spinal cord. We observed correlated spatiotemporal expression of Kir4.1 with VGLUT1, but not VGLUT2, expression during development in the mouse spinal cord (Figure S2). Interestingly, FαMNs have a larger VGLUT1 synaptic density than SαMNs (Basaldella et al., 2015Basaldella E. Takeoka A. Sigrist M. Arber S. Multisensory signaling shapes vestibulo-motor circuit specificity.Cell. 2015; 163: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), consistent with the observed higher Kir4.1 expression levels around FαMNs (Figures 1H and 1I). To determine whether VGLUT1 activity is required for AS Kir4.1 expression, we analyzed VGLUT1−/− conventional KO animals (Morel et al., 2014Morel L. Higashimori H. Tolman M. Yang Y. VGluT1+ neuronal glutamatergic signaling regulates postnatal developmental maturation of cortical protoplasmic astroglia.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 10950-10962Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We found that VGLUT1 loss of function led to dramatic reduction of AS Kir4.1 expression in ventral horn (Figures 1J and 1K). Consistent with Kir4.1 expression dictated in part by neuron-derived factors, we found that spinal cord Kir4.1 (Kcnj10) levels were downregulated in a genetic MN ablation model at embryonic day 18.5 (E18.5) (Figure S3). Together, these findings suggest that AS Kir4.1 expression levels show both regional (i.e., ventral versus dorsal horn) and subregional (i.e., FαMNs versus SαMNs) differences and are regulated in a VGLUT1-dependent manner in vivo. The findings above suggested that AS Kir4.1 developmental upregulation requires VGLUT1 synaptic signaling on MNs. To investigate a requirement for AS-encoded Kir4.1 for ventral horn MNs, we intercrossed Aldh1l1-cre, which targets most AS in the ventral spinal cord (but not MNs, and only 30% of oligodendrocytes; Molofsky et al., 2014Molofsky A.V.

Casper K.B. Philpot B.D. Chin L.S. McCarthy K.D. Conditional knock-out of Kir4.1 leads to glial membrane depolarization, inhibition of potassium and glutamate uptake, and enhanced short-term synaptic potentiation.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 11354-11365Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) (Figures S4A–S4C). Aldh1l1-cre:Kir4.1fl/fl animals, heretofore called AS-Kir4.1cKO, survived in normal numbers up to at least 1 year of age (data not shown). Mice were crossed with Aldh1l1-GFP reporter animals for AS visualization. AS Kir4.1 protein expression was undetectable in ventral horn gray matter AS of AS-Kir4.1cKO mice compared to cre-negative controls (Figures S4A–S4C); in contrast, Kir4.1 expression was preserved in 70% of oligodendrocytes in AS-Kir4.1cKO animals (Figures S4A–S4C). The number of Aldh1l1-GFP+ AS was identical in AS-Kir4.1cKO and cre-negative control mice (data not shown). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of FACS-purified spinal cord Aldh1l1-GFP+ AS from AS-Kir4.1cKO and cre-negative control mice showed that: (1) Kir4.1 (Kcnj10) was the most significantly downregulated transcript, whereas in contrast, (2) other AS differentiation genes, including glutamate transporters, showed non-significant changes (Figure S4D). Although previous work showed that Kir4.1-dependent maintenance of AS membrane potential was required for glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) function (Djukic et al., 2007Djukic B. Casper K.B. Philpot B.D. Chin L.S. McCarthy K.D. Conditional knock-out of Kir4.1 leads to glial membrane depolarization, inhibition of potassium and glutamate uptake, and enhanced short-term synaptic potentiation.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 11354-11365Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), we did not find any difference in total and GLT-1-mediated (+DHK) glutamate uptake between AS-Kir4.1cKO and cre-negative control spinal cords (Figure S4E). These findings indicate that Aldh1l1-cre drives AS loss of Kir4.1 function but does not change glutamate uptake/transporter expression. Moreover, we did not observe gliosis or microglial activation at any time points analyzed in AS-Kir4.1cKO mice (Figures S4F–S4H). Having confirmed AS Kir4.1 loss of function, we next focused on consequences for MN survival. AS-Kir4.1cKO and cre-negative controls were intercrossed with ChAT-GFP mice for MN visualization (Figure 2A). We did not detect losses in FαMN, SαMN, or γMN populations in the lumbar spinal cord of AS-Kir4.1cKO mice compared to cre-negative controls at postnatal day 14 (P14), P30, and 6 months of age, as shown in Figure 2A. Thus, AS Kir4.1 is dispensable for the specification and survival of MNs. We next analyzed the morphological properties of MN subpopulations (Kanning et al., 2010Kanning K.C. Kaplan A. Henderson C.E. Motor neuron diversity in development and disease.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 33: 409-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). While we observed normal mature soma sizes for all MN subtypes at P14 (Figures 2B and 2C), by P30 the largest ChAT+ MN populations were no longer detectable in the lumbar (L3–L6) ventral spinal cord of AS-Kir4.1cKO mice. Indeed, we found a selective decrease in size of FαMNs at P30 and 6 months of age, whereas the size of SαMNs and γMNs remained unaffected (Figures 2B–2G).

We infected 9 pregnant monkeys with ZIKV, 6 early in pregnancy (weeks 6-7 of gestation) and 3 later in pregnancy (weeks 12-14 of gestation), and compared findings with uninfected controls. 100% (6 of 6) of monkeys infected early in pregnancy exhibited prolonged maternal viremia and fetal neuropathology, including fetal loss, smaller brain size, and histopathologic brain lesions, including microcalcifications, hemorrhage, necrosis, vasculitis, gliosis, and apoptosis of neuroprogenitor cells. High-resolution MRI demonstrated concordant lesions indicative of deep gray matter injury. We also observed spinal, ocular, and neuromuscular pathology. Our data show that vascular compromise and neuroprogenitor cell dysfunction are hallmarks of CZS pathogenesis, suggesting novel strategies to prevent and to treat this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2794576774,"How primates perceive objects along with their detailed features remains a mystery. This ability to make fine visual discriminations depends upon a high-acuity analysis of spatial frequency (SF) along the visual hierarchy from V1 to inferotemporal cortex. By studying the transformation of SF across macaque parafoveal V1, V2, and V4, we discovered SF-selective functional domains in V4 encoding higher SFs up to 12 cycles/°. These intermittent higher-SF-selective domains, surrounded by domains encoding lower SFs, violate the inverse relationship between SF preference and retinal eccentricity. The neural activities of higher- and lower-SF domains correspond to local and global features, respectively, of the same stimuli. Neural response latencies in high-SF domains are around 10 ms later than in low-SF domains, consistent with the coarse-to-fine nature of perception. Thus, our finding of preserved resolution from V1 into V4, separated both spatially and temporally, may serve as a connecting link for detailed object representation."
https://openalex.org/W2794944257,"Recent studies suggest that cardiac fibroblast-specific p38α MAPK contributes to the development of cardiac hypertrophy, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Our study used a novel fibroblast-specific, tamoxifen-inducible p38α knockout (KO) mouse line to characterize the role of fibroblast p38α in modulating cardiac hypertrophy, and we elucidated the mechanism. Myocardial injury was induced in tamoxifen-treated Cre-positive p38α KO mice or control littermates via chronic infusion of the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. Cardiac function was assessed by pressure-volume conductance catheter analysis and was evaluated for cardiac hypertrophy at tissue, cellular, and molecular levels. Isoproterenol infusion in control mice promoted overt cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction (reduced ejection fraction, increased end systolic volume, increased cardiac weight index, increased cardiomyocyte area, increased fibrosis, and up-regulation of myocyte fetal genes and hypertrophy-associated microRNAs). Fibroblast-specific p38α KO mice exhibited marked protection against myocardial injury, with isoproterenol-induced alterations in cardiac function, histology, and molecular markers all being attenuated. In vitro mechanistic studies determined that cardiac fibroblasts responded to damaged myocardium by secreting several paracrine factors known to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, including IL-6, whose secretion was dependent upon p38α activity. In conclusion, cardiac fibroblast p38α contributes to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac dysfunction, potentially via a mechanism involving paracrine fibroblast-to-myocyte IL-6 signaling.-Bageghni, S.

Surveillance systems based on predictions allow for timely decision making processes, and in turn, timely and efficient interventions to reduce the burden of the disease. We conducted a comparative study of dengue predictions in São Paulo city to test the performance of trained seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models, generalized additive models and artificial neural networks. We also used a naïve model as a benchmark. A generalized additive model with lags of the number of cases and meteorological variables had the best performance, predicted epidemics of unprecedented magnitude and its performance was 3.16 times higher than the benchmark and 1.47 higher that the next best performing model. The predictive models captured the seasonal patterns but differed in their capacity to anticipate large epidemics and all outperformed the benchmark. In addition to be able to predict epidemics of unprecedented magnitude, the best model had computational advantages, since its training and tuning was straightforward and required seconds or at most few minutes. These are desired characteristics to provide timely results for decision makers. However, it should be noted that predictions are made just one month ahead and this is a limitation that future studies could try to reduce."
https://openalex.org/W2794664352,"Rapid and efficient synaptic vesicle fusion requires a pool of primed vesicles, the nearby tethering of Ca2+ channels, and the presence of the phospholipid PIP2 in the target membrane. Although the presynaptic active zone mediates the first two requirements, it is unclear how fusion is targeted to membranes with high PIP2 content. Here we find that the C2B domain of the active zone scaffold RIM is critical for action potential-triggered fusion. Remarkably, the known RIM functions in vesicle priming and Ca2+ influx do not require RIM C2B domains. Instead, biophysical experiments reveal that RIM C2 domains, which lack Ca2+ binding, specifically bind to PIP2. Mutational analyses establish that PIP2 binding to RIM C2B and its tethering to the other RIM domains are crucial for efficient exocytosis. We propose that RIM C2B domains are constitutive PIP2-binding modules that couple mechanisms for vesicle priming and Ca2+ channel tethering to PIP2-containing target membranes."

Ozanimod and its active metabolite, RP-101075, exhibit a similar specificity profile at the S1P receptor family in vitro and pharmacodynamic profile in vivo. The NZBWF1 mouse model was used in therapeutic dosing mode to assess the potential benefit of ozanimod and RP-101075 in an established animal model of systemic lupus erythematosus. Compared with vehicle-treated animals, ozanimod and RP-101075 reduced proteinuria over the duration of the study and serum blood urea nitrogen at termination. Additionally, ozanimod and RP-101075 reduced kidney disease in a dose-dependent manner, as measured by histological assessment of mesangial expansion, endo- and exo-capillary proliferation, interstitial infiltrates and fibrosis, glomerular deposits, and tubular atrophy. Further exploration into gene expression changes in the kidney demonstrate that RP-101075 also significantly reduced expression of fibrotic and immune-related genes in the kidneys. Of note, RP-101075 lowered the number of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, a major source of interferon alpha in lupus patients, and reduced all B and T cell subsets in the spleen. Given the efficacy demonstrated by ozanimod and its metabolite RP-101075 in the NZBWF1 preclinical animal model, ozanimod may warrant clinical evaluation as a potential treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus."

Both surveys included questions on asthma, COPD, respiratory and sleep-related symptoms, including difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early-morning awakening, and excessive daytime sleepiness. ACO was defined as having both self-reported asthma and COPD. Results The prevalence of ACO was 1.0%. The group with ACO had a higher prevalence of both insomnia and respiratory symptoms than subjects with only asthma or COPD. Having ACO was independently associated with a 2–3 times higher probability of having sleep-related symptoms as compared with the group without asthma or COPD, after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, smoking history and educational level (adjusted odds ratio 2.14–3.36, 95% CI).

MgF2 conversion layer was first produced by immersing Mg alloy substrate in hydrofluoric acid solution. The outer PCL coating was then prepared using dip coating technique. Morphology, elements profile, phase structure, roughness, mechanical properties, invitro corrosion, and biocompatibility of duplex MgF2/PCL coating were then characterized and compared to those of fluoride coated and uncoated Mg samples. The invivo degradation behavior and biocompatibility of duplex MgF2/PCL coating with respect to ZK60 Mg alloy were also studied using rabbit model for 2 weeks. SEM and TEM analysis showed that the duplex coating was uniform and comprised of porous PCL film (~3.3 μm) as upper layer with compact MgF2 (~2.2 μm) as inner layer. No significant change in microhardness was found on duplex coating compared with uncoated ZK60 Mg alloy. The duplex coating showed improved invitro corrosion resistance than single layered MgF2 or uncoated alloy samples. The duplex coating also resulted in better cell viability, cell adhesion, and cell proliferation compared to fluoride coated or uncoated alloy. Preliminary invivo studies indicated that duplex MgF2/PCL coating reduced the degradation rate of ZK60 Mg alloy and exhibited good biocompatibility. These results suggested that duplex MgF2/PCL coating on magnesium alloy might have great potential for orthopedic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2795777685,"Objective 
Using our previously developed and tested Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) Stigma Scale, we investigated factors associated with perceived SRH stigma among adolescent girls in Ghana.


Methods 
We drew upon data from our survey study of 1,063 females 15-24yrs recruited from community- and clinic-based sites in two Ghanaian cities. Our Adolescent SRH Stigma Scale comprised 20 items and 3 sub-scales (Internalized, Enacted, Lay Attitudes) to measure stigma occurring with sexual activity, contraceptive use, pregnancy, abortion and family planning service use. We assessed relationships between a comprehensive set of demographic, health and social factors and SRH Stigma with multi-level multivariable linear regression models.


Results 
In unadjusted bivariate analyses, compared to their counterparts, SRH stigma scores were higher among girls who were younger, Accra residents, Muslim, still in/dropped out of secondary school, unemployed, reporting excellent/very good health, not in a relationship, not sexually experienced, never received family planning services, never used contraception, but had been pregnant (all p-values <0.05). In multivariable models, higher SRH stigma scores were associated with history of pregnancy (β = 1.53, CI = 0.51,2.56) and excellent/very good self-rated health (β = 0.89, CI = 0.20,1.58), while lower stigma scores were associated with older age (β = -0.17, 95%CI = -0.24,-0.09), higher educational attainment (β = -1.22, CI = -1.82,-0.63), and sexual intercourse experience (β = -1.32, CI = -2.10,-0.55).


Conclusions 
Findings provide insight into factors contributing to SRH stigma among this young Ghanaian female sample. Further research disentangling the complex interrelationships between SRH stigma, health, and social context is needed to guide multi-level interventions to address SRH stigma and its causes and consequences for adolescents worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2796183710,"α-Synuclein (α-syn) is a major component of Lewy bodies found in synucleinopathies including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Under the pathological conditions, α-syn tends to generate a diverse form of aggregates showing toxicity to neuronal cells and able to transmit across cells. However, mechanisms by which α-syn aggregates affect cytotoxicity in neurons have not been fully elucidated. Here we report that α-syn aggregates preferentially sequester specific synaptic proteins such as vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) through direct binding which is resistant to SDS. The sequestration effect of α-syn aggregates was shown in a cell-free system, cultured primary neurons, and PD mouse model. Furthermore, we identified a specific blocking peptide derived from VAMP2 which partially inhibited the sequestration by α-syn aggregates and contributed to reduced neurotoxicity. These results provide a mechanism of neurotoxicity mediated by α-syn aggregates and suggest that the blocking peptide interfering with the pathological role of α-syn aggregates could be useful for designing a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of PD."

Utilizing a cross-sectional design, potential correlates of DV experience were explored among a geographically-clustered random sample of 100 recently-married women residing in slums in Pune, India. In multivariable regression, DV experience was associated with less educational attainment by the participant's spouse (standardized β = -0.281, p = 0.004), less satisfaction of the spouse's family with the maanpaan (wedding-related gifts provided by the bride's family) they received at the time of marriage (standardized β = -0.298, p<0.001), poorer conflict negotiation skills (standardized β = -0.308, p<0.001), and greater acknowledgement of DV occurrence in family and friends (standardized β = 0.436, p<0.001). These correlates suggest strategies that could be incorporated into future DV primary prevention interventions for this vulnerable population (i.e. promoting completion of formal education of boys alongside girls, mitigating causes of familial dowry harassment, improving conflict negotiation skills, and challenging norms surrounding DV)."

The crystal structure of human PPM1A (also known as PP2Cα), the first PPM structure determined, displays two tightly bound Mn2+ ions in the active site and a small subdomain, termed the Flap, located adjacent to the active site. Some recent crystal structures of bacterial or plant PPM phosphatases have disclosed two tightly bound metal ions and an additional third metal ion in the active site. Here, the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of human PPM1A, PPM1Acat, complexed with a cyclic phosphopeptide, c(MpSIpYVA), a cyclized variant of the activation loop of p38 MAPK (a physiological substrate of PPM1A), revealed three metal ions in the active site. The PPM1Acat D146E–c(MpSIpYVA) complex confirmed the presence of the anticipated third metal ion in the active site of metazoan PPM phosphatases. Biophysical and computational methods suggested that complex formation results in a slightly more compact solution conformation through reduced conformational flexibility of the Flap subdomain. We also observed that the position of the substrate in the active site allows solvent access to the labile third metal-binding site. Enzyme kinetics of PPM1Acat toward a phosphopeptide substrate supported a random-order, bi-substrate mechanism, with substantial interaction between the bound substrate and the labile metal ion. This work illuminates the structural and thermodynamic basis of an innate mechanism regulating the activity of PPM phosphatases."

A total of 50 defects were created in the diaphysis of the radii of 25 male Sprague-Dawley rats. These defects were randomly divided into five groups (n = 10 defects for each group) and treated by autograft, plain PMMA, PG and PMMA-PG or left untreated. The rats were examined clinically and radiologically during the experiment and also after euthanasia at the 8th post-operative week, the healed defects were evaluated by gross morphology, histopathology, histomorphometry, computed tomography, scanning electron microscopy and biomechanical testing. PG could function as efficiently as autograft in promoting bone healing of the radial bones. Additionally, bone formation, and densities of cartilaginous and osseous tissues in the defects treated with autograft, PG and PMMA-PG were more satisfactory than the untreated and PMMA treated defects. Compared with the PMMA-PG implant, more PMMA residuals remained in the defect area and induced more intense inflammatory reaction. In conclusion, addition of PG could improve the bone regenerative properties of PMMA bone cement compared with PMMA alone in vivo. Therefore, the PG-PMMA can be proposed as a promising option to increase regenerative potential of PMMA, particularly when it is used as fixator, filler or adhesive in the dentistry, neurosurgery and bone tissue engineering applications."

Material and methods Sixty-four people with T1DM (13 females; age: 34 ± 8 years; HbA1c: 7.8 ± 1% (62 ± 13 mmol.mol-1) performed a CPX test until maximum exhaustion. kHR was calculated by a second-degree polynomial representation between post-warm up and maximum power output. Adjusted stepwise linear regression analysis was performed to investigate kHR and its associations. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed based on kHR for groups kHR < 0.20 vs. > 0.20 in relation to HbA1c. Results We found significant relationships between kHR and HbA1c (β = -0.70, P < 0.0001), age (β = -0.23, P = 0.03) and duration of diabetes (β = 0.20, P = 0.04). Stepwise linear regression resulted in an overall adjusted R2 of 0.57 (R = 0.79, P < 0.0001). Our data revealed also significant associations between kHR and percentage of heart rate at heart rate turn point from maximum heart rate (β = 0.43, P < 0.0001) and maximum power output relativized to bodyweight (β = 0.44, P = 0.001) (overall adjusted R2 of 0.44 (R = 0.53, P < 0.0001)). ROC curve analysis based on kHR resulted in a HbA1c threshold of 7.9% (62 mmol.mol-1). Conclusion Our data demonstrate atypical HRPC during CPX testing that were mainly related to glycemic control in people with T1DM."
https://openalex.org/W2794911386,"Background Agreed international development standards underpin high quality de novo clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). There is however, no international consensus on how high quality CPGs should ‘look’; or on whether high quality CPGs from one country can be viably implemented elsewhere. Writing de novo CPGs is generally resource-intensive and expensive, making this challenging in resource-poor environments. This paper proposes an alternative, efficient method of producing high quality CPGs in such circumstances, using existing CPGs layered by local knowledge, contexts and products. Methods We undertook a mixed methods case study in South African (SA) primary healthcare (PHC), building on findings from four independent studies. These comprised an overview of international CPG activities; a rapid literature review on international CPG development practices; critical appraisal of 16 purposively-sampled SA PHC CPGs; and additional interrogation of these CPGs regarding how, why and for whom, they had been produced, and how they ‘looked’. Results Despite a common aim to improve SA PHC healthcare practices, the included CPGs had different, unclear and inconsistent production processes, terminology and evidence presentation styles. None aligned with international quality standards. However many included innovative succinct guidance for end-users (which we classified as evidence-based summary recommendations, patient management tools or protocols). We developed a three-tiered model, a checklist and a glossary of common terms, for more efficient future production of better quality, contextually-relevant, locally-implementable SA PHC CPGs. Tier 1 involves transparent synthesis of existing high quality CPG recommendations; Tier 2 reflects local expertise to layer Tier 1 evidence with local contexts; and Tier 3 comprises tailored locally-relevant end-user guidance. Conclusion Our model could be relevant for any resource-poor environment. It should reduce effort and costs in finding and synthesising available research evidence, whilst efficiently focusing scant resources on contextually-relevant evidence-based guidance, and implementation."

Dual or multiple modal imaging modalities mediated by different types of multifunctional contrast agent are generally needed for efficient cell tracking. Here, we created a new contrast agent—PLGA/iron oxide microparticles (PLGA/IO MPs) and characterized the morphology, structure and function of enhancing both photoacoustic (PA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both PA and MRI signal increased with increased Fe concentration of PLGA/IO MPs. Fluorescent staining, Prussian blue staining and transmission electron microscope (TEM) certified that PLGA/IO MPs were successfully encapsulated in the labeled TSCs. The established PLGA/IO MPs demonstrated superior ability of dual-modal PA/MRI tracking of TSCs without cytotoxicity at relatively lower Fe concentrations (50, 100 and 200 μg/mL). The optimal Fe concentration of PLGA/IO MPs was determined to be 100 μg/mL, thus laying a foundation for the further study of dual-modal PA/MRI tracking of TSCs in vivo and promoting the repair of injured tendon."

In recent times, treatment with glucocorticoid analogues has been shown to improve the neurological symptoms that characterize this condition, but the molecular mechanism of action of these analogues remains unknown. Hence, the aim of this study was to gain insight into the molecular mechanism of action of glucocorticoid analogues in the treatment of A-T by investigating the role of Dexamethasone (Dexa) in A-T lymphoblastoid cell lines. We used 2DE and tandem MS to identify proteins that were influenced by the drug in A-T cells but not in healthy cells. Thirty-four proteins were defined out of a total of 746±63. Transcriptome analysis was performed by microarray and showed the differential expression of 599 A-T and 362 wild type (WT) genes and a healthy un-matching between protein abundance and the corresponding gene expression variation. The proteomic and transcriptomic profiles allowed the network pathway analysis to pinpoint the biological and molecular functions affected by Dexamethasone in Dexa-treated cells. The present integrated study provides evidence of the molecular mechanism of action of Dexamethasone in an A-T cellular model but also the broader effects of the drug in other tested cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2795992573,"miR-27b is reported to participate in the proliferation and differentiation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and to regulate fat metabolism of rat HSCs by targeting retinoid X receptor a. Our previous study also indicated that the recombinant P40 protein from Schistosoma japonicum (rSjP40) inhibited the activation of HSCs. In this study, we observed the expression of miR-27b in rSjP40-treated LX-2 cells and explored its potential mechanisms. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that rSjP40 inhibits the expression of miR-27b in LX-2 cells. Further results obtained by Western blot and dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-27b regulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g (PPARγ) expression in rSjP40-treated LX-2 cells by targeting the 3′-UTR of PPARγ. 5-AZA-2’ -deoxycytidine (5-AZA-dC), which inhibits methylation of HSCs, partially reversed rSjP40-induced down-regulation expression of miR-27b in LX-2 cells. 5-AZA-dC also partially reversed rSjP40-induced up-regulation expression of PPARγ in LX-2 cells. The increased expression of PPARγ in rSjP40-treated LX-2 cells may be partially due to miR-27b methylation. Therefore, our study provides further insight into the mechanism by which rSjP40 inhibits HSC activation and provides a basis for future study of the blocking effect of rSjP40 in liver fibrosis.—Zhu, D., Lyu, L., Shen, P., Wang, J., Chen, J., Sun, X., Chen, L., Zhang, L., Zhou, Q., Duan, Y. rSjP40 protein promotes PPARγ expression in LX-2 cells through microRNA-27b.

https://openalex.org/W2795656741,"Objective 
The aim of this study was to perform an exposure assessment of PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5μm in aerodynamic diameter) among children and to explore the potential sources of exposure from both indoor and outdoor environments.


Methods 
In terms of real-time exposure measurements of PM2.5, we collected data from 57 children aged 8–12 years (9.64 ± 0.93 years) in two schools in Shanghai, China. Simultaneously, questionnaire surveys and time-activity diaries were used to estimate the environment at home and daily time-activity patterns in order to estimate the exposure dose of PM2.5 in these children. Principle component regression analysis was used to explore the influence of potential sources of PM2.5 exposure.


Results 
All the median personal exposure and microenvironment PM2.5 concentrations greatly exceeded the daily 24-h PM2.5 Ambient Air Quality Standards of China, the USA, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The median Etotal (the sum of the PM2.5 exposure levels in different microenvironment and fractional time) of all students was 3014.13 (μg.h)/m3. The concentration of time-weighted average (TWA) exposure of all students was 137.01 μg/m3. The median TWA exposure level during the on-campus period (135.81 μg/m3) was significantly higher than the off-campus period (115.50 μg/m3, P = 0.013 < 0.05). Besides ambient air pollution and meteorological conditions, storey height of the classroom and mode of transportation to school were significantly correlated with children’s daily PM2.5 exposure.


Conclusions 
Children in the two selected schools were exposed to high concentrations of PM2.5 in winter of 2013 in Shanghai. Their personal PM2.5 exposure was mainly associated with ambient air conditions, storey height of the classroom, and children’s transportation mode to school."
https://openalex.org/W2795182400,"The type I cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKG I) serve essential physiological functions, including smooth muscle relaxation, cardiac remodeling, and platelet aggregation. These enzymes form homodimers through their N-terminal dimerization domains, a feature implicated in regulating their cooperative activation. Previous investigations into the activation mechanisms of PKG I isoforms have been largely influenced by structures of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Here, we examined PKG Iα activation by cGMP and cAMP by engineering a monomeric form that lacks N-terminal residues 1–53 (Δ53). We found that the construct exists as a monomer as assessed by whole-protein MS, size-exclusion chromatography, and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Reconstruction of the SAXS 3D envelope indicates that Δ53 has a similar shape to the heterodimeric RIα–C complex of PKA. Moreover, we found that the Δ53 construct is autoinhibited in its cGMP-free state and can bind to and be activated by cGMP in a manner similar to full-length PKG Iα as assessed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy. However, we found that the Δ53 variant does not exhibit cooperative activation, and its cyclic nucleotide selectivity is diminished. These findings support a model in which, despite structural similarities, PKG Iα activation is distinct from that of PKA, and its cooperativity is driven by in trans interactions between protomers."

The tau pathology burden correlates with neurodegeneration and dementia observed in these diseases. The microtubule binding domain of tau is essential for its physiological functions in promoting neuronal cytoskeletal stability, however it is also required for tau to assemble into an amyloid structure that comprises pathological inclusions. A series of novel monoclonal antibodies were generated which recognize the second and fourth microtubule-binding repeat domain of tau, thus enabling the identification specifically of 4-repeat tau versus 3-/4-repeat tau, respectively. These antibodies are highly specific for tau and recognize pathological tau inclusions in human tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and in transgenic mouse models of tauopathies. These new antibodies will be useful for identifying and characterizing different tauopathies and as tools to target tau pathology in these diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2795657975,"Eyespot, caused by the soil-borne necrotrophic fungi Oculimacula yallundae and O. acuformis, is a disease of major economic significance for wheat, barley and rye. Pacific Northwest (PNW) winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown in areas of high rainfall and moderate winters is most vulnerable to infection. The objective of this research was to identify novel genomic regions associated with eyespot resistance in winter wheat adapted to the PNW. Two winter wheat panels of 469 and 399 lines were compiled for one of the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of eyespot resistance in US winter wheat germplasm. These panels were genotyped with the Infinium 9K and 90K iSelect SNP arrays. Both panels were phenotyped for disease resistance in a two-year field study and in replicated growth chamber trials. Growth chamber trials were used to evaluate the genetic resistance of O. acuformis and O. yallundae species separately. Best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) were calculated across all field and growth chamber environments. A total of 73 marker-trait associations (MTAs) were detected on nine different chromosomes (1A, 2A, 2B, 4A, 5A, 5B, 7A, 7B and 7D) that were significantly associated (p-value <0.001) with eyespot resistance in Panel A, and 19 MTAs on nine different chromosomes (1A, 1B, 2A, 2D, 3B, 5A, 5B, 7A, and 7B) in Panel B. The most significant SNPs were associated with Pch1 and Pch2 resistance genes on the long arms of chromosome 7D and 7A. Most of the novel MTAs appeared to have a minor effect on reducing eyespot disease. Nevertheless, eyespot disease scores decreased as the number of resistance alleles increased. Seven SNP markers, significantly associated with reducing eyespot disease across environments and in the absence and presence of Pch1 were identified. These markers were located on chromosomes 2A (IWB8331), 5A (IWB73709), 5B (IWB47298), 7AS (IWB47160), 7B (IWB45005) and two SNPs (Ex_c44379_2509 and IAAV4340) had unknown map positions. The additive effect of the MTAs explained most of the remaining phenotypic variation not accounted for by Pch1 or Pch2. This study provides breeders with adapted germplasm and novel sources of eyespot resistance to be used in the development of superior cultivars with increased eyespot resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2795825566,"Immune response of insect vectors to transmitted pathogens or insect hosts against parasites are well studied, whereas the mechanism of tripartite interactions remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the immune interactions of the vector beetle Monochamus alternatus (Ma) to the devastating plant parasitic nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Bx) and the insect parasitic nematode Howardula phyllotretae (Hp). We report the unique immune mechanism by which the vectorbeetle tolerates many devastating Bx in its trachea, yet that immune tolerance is compromised by the parasitic nematode Hp. Contact with either nematode species triggers epithelial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in Ma. Only the entry of Bx, not Hp, infection, induces increased expression of antioxidative genes, through which the ROS levels are balanced in the trachea of beetles. Furthermore, we found that up-regulation of antioxidative genes was induced by the interaction of Toll receptors. In contrast, beetles infected by Hp retain high levels of oxidative stress and melanization in trachea, and as a result, decrease Bx loading. This study highlights the role of Toll receptors in mediating the activation of antioxidative genes in immune tolerance to plant parasitic nematodes, and suggests the use of insect parasites as a biologic control.—Zhou, J., Zhao, L.-L., Yu, H.-Y., Wang, Y.-H., Zhang, W., Hu, S.-N., Zou, Z., Sun, J.-H.

A lack of taxonomic knowledge and species misidentifications are particularly critical for conservation. Here we present an example of Potamogeton floridanus, the Florida Pondweed, an endangered taxon endemic to a small area in the Florida panhandle, whose taxonomic status remained controversial for more than a century, and all previous attempts to elucidate its identity have failed. We applied molecular approaches to tackle the origin of the mysterious taxon and supplemented them with morphological and anatomical investigations of both historical herbarium collections and plants recently collected in the type area for a comprehensive taxonomic reassessment. Sequencing of two nuclear ribosomal markers and one chloroplast non-coding spacer resulted in the surprising discovery that P. floridanus is a hybrid of P. pulcher and P. oakesianus, with the former being the maternal parent. The hybrid colony is currently geographically isolated from the distribution range of P. oakesianus. We show that previous molecular analyses have failed to reveal its hybrid identity due to inadequate nuclear DNA sequence editing. This is an example how the uncritical use of automized sequence reads can hamper molecular species identifications and also affect phylogenetic tree construction and interpretation. This unique hybrid taxon, P. ×floridanus, adds another case study to the debate on hybrid protection; consequences for its conservation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2795125381,"Exercise plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of chronic liver disease and associated metabolic disorders. A single bout of exercise induces tissue blood flow redistribution, which decreases splanchnic circulation and leads to physiologic hypoxia in the gastrointestinal system and liver. The transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), and its regulator, prolylhydroxylase 2 (PHD2), play pivotal roles in the response to oxygen flux by regulating downstream gene expression levels in the liver. We hypothesized that exercise increases the HIF-1α levels in the liver, and that the hepatic PHD2/HIF-1α axis is involved in postexercise restoration of systemic energy homeostasis. Through constant O2 consumption, CO2 production, food and water intake, and physical activity detection with metabolic chambers, we observed that one 30-min session of swimming exercise enhances systemic energy metabolism in mice. By using the noninvasive bioluminescence imaging ROSA26 oxygen-dependent domain Luc mouse model, we reveal that exercise increases in vivo HIFa levels in the liver. Intraperitoneal injections of the PHD inhibitor, dimethyloxalylglycine, mimicked exercise-induced HIFα increase, whereas the HIF-1α inhibitor, PX-478, blocked this effect. We next constructed liver-specific knockout (LKO) mouse models with albumin-Cre-mediated, hepatocyte-specific Hifla and Phd2 deletion. Compared with their controls, Hifla-LKO and Phd2-LKO mice exhibited distinct patterns of hepatic metabolism-related gene expression profiles. Moreover, Hifla-LKO mice failed to restore systemic energy homeostasis after exercise. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that a single bout of exercise disrupts systemic energy homeostasis, increasing the HIF-1a levels in the liver. These findings also provide evidence that the hepatic PHD2/HIF-1α axis is involved in postexercise systemic metabolic homeostasis.—Luo, B., Xiang, D., Wu, D., Liu, C., Fang, Y., Chen, P., Hu, Y.-P.

However, in character perception this effect is limited to characters printed in a familiar font (font-sensitive LSB effect). Here we investigated whether the LSB and font-sensitive LSB effects depend on participants’ familiarity with global structure or local component information of the stimuli through examining their transfer effects across simplified and traditional Chinese scripts: the two Chinese scripts share similar overall structures but differ in the visual complexity of local components in general. We found that LSB in expert Chinese character processing could be transferred to the Chinese script that the readers are unfamiliar with. In contrast, the font-sensitive LSB effect did not transfer, and was limited to characters with the visual complexity the readers were most familiar with. These effects suggest that the LSB effect may be generalized to another visual category with similar overall structures; in contrast, effects of within-category variations such as fonts may depend on familiarity with local component information of the stimuli, and thus may be limited to the exemplars of the category that experts are typically exposed to."

Advanced biliary tract cancer was rarely analyzed about the relationship between obesity and prognosis. We performed this study to evaluate the BMI and body weight change as prognostic factors for advanced biliary tract cancer patients with palliative chemotherapy. Methods Between January 2005 and December 2016, two hundred and seventy-six patients who underwent chemotherapy for biliary tract cancer were retrospectively analyzed. The relationship between BMI (kg/m2) and clinical outcomes including overall and progression-free survival was assessed. Additionally the relationship between change in body composition and overall survival was evaluated. Results Median overall survival was 9.7 months for underweight patients, 10.1 months for normal patients, 15.8 months for overweight group, 13.1 months for obese patients, respectively. (p = 0.047) Univariate analysis showed that BMI, stage III, age less than 64 year-old, gallbladder cancer, operation, radiotherapy and ECOG performance were significantly associated with better survival. Compared with normal patients, overweight patients (BMI 23–24.9kg/m2) had a reduced risk of mortality in multivariate analysis (HR 0.632; 95% CI 0.436–0.918, p = 0.016). In the additional analysis for the effect of changes in body weight and BMI to the overall survival, decrease in body weight and BMI (HR 1.410, 95% CI 1.168–1.986, p = 0.046) was associated with a shorter in overall survival. Conclusion Overweight status and the maintenance of body weight during the initial period of chemotherapy are important and independent predictors of better overall survival in advanced biliary tract cancer patients."

Recently, the PLEASE study did not demonstrate any additional clinical benefit of longer-term versus shorter-term antibiotic treatment. However, the economic impact of the antibiotic strategies has not been investigated. Methods This prospective economic evaluation, adhering a societal perspective, was performed alongside the PLEASE study, a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind 1:1:1 randomized clinical trial in which all patients received open-label intravenous ceftriaxone for two weeks before the 12-week randomized blinded oral antibiotic regimen (doxycycline, clarithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine, or placebo). Between 2010 and 2013, patients (n = 271) with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms were enrolled and followed for one year. Main outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental net monetary benefit of longer-term versus shorter-term antibiotic therapy. Results Mean quality-adjusted life years (95% CI) were not significantly different (p = 0.96): 0.82 (0.77–0.88) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline (n = 82), 0.81 (0.76–0.88) for ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine (n = 93), and 0.81 (0.76–0.86) for ceftriaxone/placebo (n = 96). Total societal costs per patient (95% CI) were not significantly different either (p = 0.35): €11,995 (€8,823-€15,670) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline, €12,202 (€9,572-€15,253) for ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine, and €15,249 (€11,294-€19,781) for ceftriaxone/placebo. Incremental net monetary benefit (95% CI) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline compared to ceftriaxone/placebo varied from €3,317 (-€2,199-€8,998) to €4,285 (-€6,085-€14,524) over the willingness-to-pay range, and that of ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine compared to ceftriaxone/placebo from €3,098 (-€888-€7,172) to €3,710 (-€4,254-€11,651). For every willingness-to-pay threshold, the incremental net monetary benefits did not significantly differ from zero. Conclusion The longer-term treatments were similar with regard to costs, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness compared to shorter-term treatment in patients with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms after one year of follow-up. Given the results of this study, and taking into account the external costs associated with antibiotic resistance, the shorter-term treatment is the antibiotic regimen of first choice."

By reducing the feed rate, the optimal feed rate when the chip formation became unstable was studied. Most importantly, the impact on the roughness and reflectance was examined when the chip formation ceased to be continuous. It was determined that for a feed rate below 3 mm/min, the surface roughness always improved as the feed rate decreased, at the cost of a reduction of the normalized reflectance. The reduction of reflectance was determined to be the result of the lower material removal rates that led to a discontinuous chip formation."
https://openalex.org/W2794614275,"The thylakoid lumen is a membrane-enclosed aqueous compartment. Growing evidence indicates that the thylakoid lumen is not only a sink for protons and inorganic ions translocated during photosynthetic reactions but also a place for metabolic activities, e.g. proteolysis of photodamaged proteins, to sustain efficient photosynthesis. However, the mechanism whereby organic molecules move across the thylakoid membranes to sustain these lumenal activities is not well understood. In a recent study of Cyanophora paradoxa chloroplasts (muroplasts), we fortuitously detected a conspicuous diffusion channel activity in the thylakoid membranes. Here, using proteoliposomes reconstituted with the thylakoid membranes from muroplasts and from two other phylogenetically distinct organisms, cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and spinach, we demonstrated the existence of nonselective channels large enough for enabling permeation of small organic compounds (e.g. carbohydrates and amino acids with Mr < 1500) in the thylakoid membranes. Moreover, we purified, identified, and characterized a muroplast channel named here CpTPOR. Osmotic swelling experiments revealed that CpTPOR forms a nonselective pore with an estimated radius of ∼1.3 nm. A lipid bilayer experiment showed variable-conductance channel activity with a typical single-channel conductance of 1.8 nS in 1 m KCl with infrequent closing transitions. The CpTPOR amino acid sequence was moderately similar to that of a voltage-dependent anion-selective channel of the mitochondrial outer membrane, although CpTPOR exhibited no obvious selectivity for anions and no voltage-dependent gating. We propose that transmembrane diffusion pathways are ubiquitous in the thylakoid membranes, presumably enabling rapid transfer of various metabolites between the lumen and stroma."
https://openalex.org/W2795415008,"Objective This study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new more thermostable Flolan (epoprostenol) solution prepared with the reformulated pH 12.0 diluent in Japanese patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) receiving higher doses of Flolan than those typically administered in Western countries. Methods This open-label, single-arm study was conducted in 10 Japanese PAH patients. During the run-in period, patients were intravenously infused with Flolan (45 ng/kg/min or higher doses) solution prepared with the existing pH 10.5 diluent. The patients were then switched to a new more thermostable Flolan solution prepared with the reformulated pH 12.0 diluent and observed for a 4-week treatment period. As a primary endpoint, safety after switching to the new Flolan solution was evaluated. Secondary endpoints included hemodynamics and the necessity for dose adjustment of Flolan in these patients. Results All 10 patients completed the study period. Observed adverse events were nausea and hepatic function abnormal in 1 patient each, and both events were mild. No patients required dose adjustment due to the change from baseline in mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) measured 3 hrs after switching to Flolan solution prepared with the reformulated diluent. No major changes from baseline in mPAP, pulmonary vascular resistance, or right atrial pressure were observed at 24 hrs and at 4 weeks after switching to the Flolan solution prepared with pH 12.0 diluent. Although some patients showed increases in cardiac output (CO) from baseline at 24 hrs and 4 weeks, no patients required dose reduction as a result of an increase in CO. Conclusion Neither safety/efficacy concerns nor any dose adjustments of Flolan after switching to a more thermostable Flolan solution prepared with the reformulated pH 12.0 diluent could be required in Japanese patients with PAH receiving higher doses of Flolan.

https://openalex.org/W2795437100,"It is well-known that blood glucose oscillates with a period of approximately 15 min (900 s) and exhibits an overall complex behaviour in intact organisms. This complexity is not thoroughly studied, and thus, we aimed to decipher the frequency bands entailed in blood glucose regulation. We explored high-resolution blood glucose time-series sampled using a novel continuous intravascular sensor in four pigs under general anaesthesia for almost 24 hours. In all time series, we found several interesting oscillatory components, especially in the 5000–10000 s, 500–1000 s, and 50–100 s regions (0.0002–0.0001 Hz, 0.002–0.001 Hz, and 0.02–0.01 Hz). The presence of these oscillations is not permanent, as they come and go. This is the first report of glucose oscillations in the 50–100 s range. The origin of these oscillations and their role in overall blood glucose regulation is unknown. Although the sample size is small, we believe this finding is important for our understanding of glucose regulation and perhaps for our understanding of general homeostatic regulation in intact organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2795576647,"Despite increasing ability to store and analyze large amounts of data for organismal and ecological studies, the process of collecting distance and count measurements from images has largely remained time consuming and error-prone, particularly for tasks for which automation is difficult or impossible. Improving the efficiency of these tasks, which allows for more high quality data to be collected in a shorter amount of time, is therefore a high priority. The open-source web application, webpic, implements common web languages and widely available libraries and productivity apps to streamline the process of collecting distance and count measurements from images. In this paper, I introduce the framework of webpic and demonstrate one readily available feature of this application, linear measurements, using fossil leaf specimens. This application fills the gap between workflows accomplishable by individuals through existing software and those accomplishable by large, unmoderated crowds. It demonstrates that flexible web languages can be used to streamline time-intensive research tasks without the use of specialized equipment or proprietary software and highlights the potential for web resources to facilitate data collection in research tasks and outreach activities with improved efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2795432763,"This study investigated the development of young children's causal inference by studying variability in behavior. Two possible sources of variability, strategy use and accuracy in strategy execution, were discriminated and related to age. To this end, a relatively wide range of causal inference trials was administered to children of a relatively broad age range: 2- to 5-year-olds. Subsequently, individuals' response patterns over trials were analyzed with a latent variable technique. The results showed that variability in children's behavior could largely be explained by strategy use. Three different strategies were distinguished, and tentative interpretations suggest these could possibly be labeled as ""rational"", ""associative"", and ""uncertainty avoidance"" strategies. The strategies were found to be related to age, and this age-related strategy use better explained the variability in children's behavior than age-related increase in accuracy of executing a single strategy. This study can be considered a first step in introducing a new, fruitful approach for investigating the development of causal inference."
https://openalex.org/W2795975739,"Left ventricle (LV) assist, which refers to the use of a mini-pump or catheter implanted across the aortic valve connected to the pump, can promote myocardial recovery after left ventricle failure. However, conventional LV assist catheters compress the aortic valve, which can induce aortic insufficiency. Here we describe a novel LV assist catheter containing a retractable stent at its distal end that may prevent such insufficiency. The device was tested in six goats in which the coronary artery was ligated to induce acute LV failure, and then an LV assist was installed with a novel catheter in the left ventricle via the left subclavian artery. Inserting the catheter into the left ventricle caused mild to moderate aortic insufficiency. Releasing the stent maintained the catheter in the center of the three valve leaflets, which resolved the aortic insufficiency and, within a few minutes, led to significantly lower left ventricle end diastolic pressure (9.0±3.0 mmHg) than without stent release (17.6±5.0 mmHg, p = 0.012) as well as significantly higher left ventricle dP/dtmax (614±299 mmHg/s) than without stent release (343±245 mmHg/s, p = 0.03). Our results indicate that this novel drainage catheter with retractable stent can effectively prevent aortic insufficiency by maintaining the catheter in the center of the aortic valve leaflets, thereby lowering left ventricular end diastolic pressure and improving systolic function."
https://openalex.org/W2796199396,"Background After the building of the Berlin Wall in the 1960s, a number of international pharmaceutical manufacturers from the West had their drugs tested in Eastern Germany (GDR). So far, the extensive collection of documents on the subject stored in the archives of the GDR State Security Service (Stasi, MfS) has not been systematically analysed. Until now, the role of the Stasi with respect to the surveillance of the trials has been unclear. Methods A keyword search within the database of the Stasi files was conducted. All available files were screened in order to identify institutions, companies and personnel involved in the clinical trials. On this basis, further files were requested. A total of 259 files were available for analysis. Relevant data was derived from 160 of these files. A contextualised approach was applied, which critically explored the origin, content, and impact of the data. In addition, an approach guided by the central steps of document analysis was applied. Results At least 400 clinical trials were conducted during the GDR period. The exact number remains speculative. According to references found in the Stasi files, it might have been considerably higher. Initially, the main goal of the trials was for the GDR authorities to decide whether to import certain Western drugs. By 1983, this intention had changed. Now, the primary aim of the trials was the procurement of foreign currency. The Stasi feared that the pharmaceutical companies could have a significant influence on GDR Health System. Stasi spies were holding positions in the responsible medical committees, universities, and hospitals. Constant surveillance by the Stasi served the purpose of monitoring any contact between people from the West and the East. Unknowingly, representatives of Western companies were surveilled by the Stasi. The studied documents also point to the fact that a number of clinical trials conducted during the GDR period did not comply with GDR regulations, and were therefore deemed illegal by the Stasi. The Stasi was not particularly interested in medico-ethical questions. Conclusions Clinical trials conducted during the GDR period were surveilled by the Stasi. It was their aim to monitor all people involved in the trials, including their Western contacts. Relevant medico-ethical questions like patient consent and safety with respect to the clinical trials were not the focus. Considering the significant number of conducted trials, only limited evidence exists of doctors having discussed them critically. The public was not officially informed about the trials."
