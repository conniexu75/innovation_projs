We show that activation of the transcription factor c-Jun in Schwann cells is a global regulator of Wallerian degeneration. c-Jun governs major aspects of the injury response, determines the expression of trophic factors, adhesion molecules, the formation of regeneration tracks and myelin clearance and controls the distinctive regenerative potential of peripheral nerves. A key function of c-Jun is the activation of a repair program in Schwann cells and the creation of a cell specialized to support regeneration. We show that absence of c-Jun results in the formation of a dysfunctional repair cell, striking failure of functional recovery, and neuronal death. We conclude that a single glial transcription factor is essential for restoration of damaged nerves, acting to control the transdifferentiation of myelin and Remak Schwann cells to dedicated repair cells in damaged tissue.

Melton D.A. Extreme makeover: converting one cell into another.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 382-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These findings raise a key question: to what extent are natural transitions in the state of differentiated cells also governed by specific transcription factors? Such phenotypic transitions are seen in tumorigenesis, dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation. They are also fundamental to tissue repair and regeneration, and in regenerative systems, a major focus of work is identification of gene programs that are selectively activated after injury and which impact the repair process. The striking regenerative capacity of the PNS rests on the surprising plasticity of Schwann cells, and the ability of these cells to switch between differentiation states, a feature that is highly unusual in mammals (Jessen and Mirsky, 2005Jessen K.R.

In a process reminiscent of the radical injury responses of zebrafish cardiomyocytes or pigment cells of the newt iris, nerve injury, and loss of axonal contact causes mammalian Schwann cells to lose their differentiated morphology, downregulate myelin genes, upregulate markers of immature Schwann cells, and re-enter the cell cycle. This radical process of natural dedifferentiation has few if any parallels in mammalian systems. At the same time as Schwann cells dedifferentiate, they upregulate genes implicated in promoting axon growth, neuronal survival, and macrophage invasion, and activate mechanisms to break down their myelin sheaths and transform morphologically into cells with long, parallel processes. This allows them to form uninterrupted regeneration tracks (Bands of Bungner) that guide axons back to their targets (Chen et al., 2007Chen Z.L. Yu W.M. Strickland S. Peripheral regeneration.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 209-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar; Vargas and Barres, 2007Vargas M.E. Barres B.A. Why is Wallerian degeneration in the CNS so slow?.Annu. Rev.

Accelerating axon growth to overcome limitations in functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury.Neurosurgery. 2009; 65: A132-A144Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Collectively, these events together with the axonal death that triggers them are called Wallerian degeneration. This response transforms the normally growth-hostile environment of intact nerves to a growth supportive terrain, and endows the PNS with its remarkable and characteristic regenerative potential. To complete the repair process, Schwann cells envelop the regenerated axons and transform again to generate myelin and nonmyelinating (Remak) cells. Little is known about the transcriptional control of changes in adult differentiation states, including natural dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation, in any system (Jopling et al., 2011Jopling C. Boue S. Izpisua Belmonte J.C. Dedifferentiation, transdifferentiation and reprogramming: three routes to regeneration.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In line with this, although Wallerian degeneration including the Schwann cell injury response are key to repair, the molecular mechanisms that control these processes are not understood (Chen et al., 2007Chen Z.L. Yu W.M. Strickland S. Peripheral regeneration.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 209-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar; Jessen and Mirsky, 2008Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. Negative regulation of myelination: relevance for development, injury, and demyelinating disease.Glia. 2008; 56: 1552-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Conceptually also, the nature of the Schwann cell injury response has remained uncertain, since the generation of the denervated Schwann cell is commonly referred to either as dedifferentiation or as activation. These terms highlight two distinct aspects of the process, namely loss of the differentiated Schwann cell phenotypes of normal nerves and gain of the regeneration promoting phenotype, respectively, without providing a framework for analysis and comparison with other regenerative models. Here, we use mice with selective inactivation of the transcription factor c-Jun in Schwann cells to show that c-Jun is a global regulator of the Schwann cell injury response that specifies the characteristic gene expression, structure, and function of the denervated Schwann cell, a cell that is essential for nerve repair. Consequently, axonal regeneration and functional repair are strikingly compromised or absent when Schwann cell c-Jun is inactivated. Notably, the effects of c-Jun are injury specific, since c-Jun inactivation has no significant effects on nerve development or adult nerve function. These observations provide a molecular basis for understanding Schwann cell plasticity, show that c-Jun is a key regulator of Wallerian degeneration, and offer conclusive support for the notion that glial cells control repair in the PNS. They also show that the Schwann cell injury response has much in common with transdifferentiation, since it represents the generation, by dedicated transcriptional controls, of a distinct Schwann cell repair phenotype, specialized for supporting axon growth and neuronal survival in injured nerves. Because these cells form the regeneration tracks called Bungner’s bands, we will refer to them as Bungner cells. Earlier, we found that neonatal mice with conditional deletion of c-Jun in Schwann cells (c-Jun mutant mice) show delayed loss of myelin proteins and mRNA after nerve injury (Parkinson et al., 2008Parkinson D.B. Bhaskaran A. Arthur-Farraj P. Noon L.A. Woodhoo A. Lloyd A.C. Feltri M.L. Wrabetz L. Behrens A. Mirsky R. Jessen K.R. c-Jun is a negative regulator of myelination.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). This suggested that Schwann cell c-Jun might play an important role in specifying the phenotype of denervated Schwann cells. To test this comprehensively, we used Affymetrix whole-genome microarray to examine gene expression in the sciatic nerve of adult c-Jun mutant mice and control (WT) littermates and compared this with gene expression in denervated cells in the distal stump of transected nerves without regenerating axons, to avoid the complicating effects of axon-induced redifferentiation (Figure 1). We chose 7 days after injury since in regenerating mouse nerves this is near the mid-point of active axonal regrowth. Seven day denervated cells therefore represent the terrain that confronts regenerating axons in WT and mutant nerves. Before injury, the nerves of adult c-Jun mutant mice were normal on the basis of a number of criteria. Thus, the numbers of myelinated and unmyelinated axons (see Figures 4E and 4F), myelinating Schwann cells and Remak bundles (see Table S1 available online), g-ratios (Figure S1), sciatic functional index (SFI) (see Figure 7E), motor performance in a rotarod test (unpublished), and responses to heat and light touch (see Figures 7B and 7C) were similar to WT controls. While c-Jun was excised from almost all Schwann cells (Parkinson et al., 2008Parkinson D.B. Bhaskaran A. Arthur-Farraj P. Noon L.A. Woodhoo A. Lloyd A.C. Feltri M.L. Wrabetz L. Behrens A. Mirsky R. Jessen K.R. c-Jun is a negative regulator of myelination.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), c-Jun expression in neurons, macrophages, and fibroblasts was normal, and the rate of axonal disintegration after cut was similar in WT and mutants (Figures S2 and S3). The close similarity between WT and mutant nerves was confirmed by the Affymetrix screen (Figure 1), since only two genes (keratin 8 and desmoplakin) were differentially expressed. Furthermore, following injury, a comparable number of genes changed expression in WT and c-Jun mutants (Figure 1A). Importantly, however, comparison of the distal stumps of WT and c-Jun mutants revealed 172 significant differences in gene expression (Figure 1 and Tables S2 and S3). The differentially regulated genes included genes which have been implicated in regeneration and trophic support such as BDNF, GDNF, Artn, Shh, and GAP-43 that failed to upregulate after injury, together with genes that failed to downregulate normally after injury such as the myelin genes Mpz, Mbp, and Cdh1 (also known as E-cadherin). Gene ontology analysis indicated that known functions of these 172 genes were particularly related to neuronal growth and regeneration (Figure 1C). We selected 32 of the 172 disregulated genes for further analysis by RT-QPCR. In every case this confirmed the disregulation shown by the microarray data (Figures 1D–1F and Table S3). Six of the thirty-two genes were then analyzed in purified Schwann cell cultures. Comparison of c-Jun mutant and WT cells confirmed the regulation seen in the distal stumps. Furthermore, as predicted, enforced c-Jun expression in c-Jun mutant cells, by adenoviral gene transfer, activated c-Jun, BDNF, and GDNF expression but suppressed Chd1, Mpz, and Mbp expression (Figure 2A). These results show directly that c-Jun regulates these genes in Schwann cells, demonstrates that this control is independent of the nerve environment, and confirms results obtained by microarray and RT-QPCR. Lastly, we found that three proteins implicated in regeneration, N-cadherin, p75NTR, and NCAM, were disregulated in cut mutant nerves, although their mRNAs were normally expressed. Injured mutant nerves expressed strongly reduced N-cadherin and p75NTR but elevated levels of NCAM (Figures 2B and 2C). Sox2 protein, which, like c-Jun, is upregulated in WT Schwann cells of injured nerves (Parkinson et al., 2008Parkinson D.B. Bhaskaran A. Arthur-Farraj P. Noon L.A. Woodhoo A. Lloyd A.C. Feltri M.L. Wrabetz L. Behrens A. Mirsky R. Jessen K.R. c-Jun is a negative regulator of myelination.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), remained normally upregulated in injured nerves of c-Jun mutants (Figure S4). Denervated Schwann cells in injured adult nerves are often considered similar to immature Schwann cells in developing nerves. However, the immature cells for instance do not share the axon guidance, myelin breakdown and macrophage recruitment functions of denervated cells, and these cells differ in molecular expression (Jessen and Mirsky, 2008Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. Negative regulation of myelination: relevance for development, injury, and demyelinating disease.Glia. 2008; 56: 1552-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). To explore the idea that the denervated cell represents a distinct Schwann cell phenotype regulated by c-Jun, we examined three genes, Olig1, Shh, and GDNF, which showed strong, c-Jun-dependent activation in denervated cells (Figure 1D). Using RT-QPCR and in situ hybririsization we confirmed strong expression of these genes in WT adult denervated cells, but found that they were not (Olig1 and Shh) or borderline (GDNF) detectable in immature Schwann cells (from WT embryo day 18 nerve). They were also essentially absent from uncut nerves (Figures 2D and 2E and Table S4). This supports the notion that denervated adult Schwann cells and immature Schwann cells in perinatal nerves represent distinct cell types. It shows also that c-Jun takes part in controlling the distinctive molecular profile of the adult denervated cell. The response of neonatal cells to injury remains to be determined. Together these results show that c-Jun controls the molecular reprogramming that transforms mature Schwann cells to the denervated cell phenotype following injury. This includes the regulation of genes that differentiate denervated from immature cells and extends to the posttranscriptional control of protein expression. Denervated Schwann cells form cellular columns that replace the axon-Schwann cell units of intact nerves and serve as substrate for growing axons. We examined these structures by electron microscopy in the distal stump 4 weeks after cut. Because these cells have been without axonal contact for 4 weeks they are comparable to the cells encountered by growing axons in distal parts of crushed nerves in the c-Jun mutant where regeneration is delayed beyond the normal 3–4 week period, while at this time WT nerves have just reached their targets. We found that the structure of these regeneration tracks is strikingly abnormal in c-Jun mutants (Figure 3A). There are many fewer cell profiles per column, indicating reduced process formation (Figure 3B) and the cells have flattened as confirmed by reduction in the roundness index of cell profiles in vivo (Figure 3C). Flattening and paucity of processes are also seen even in c-Jun−/− cells from neonatal nerves in vitro (Figures 3D and 3E). Therefore, this is a robust phenotype that does not depend on long term denervation in vivo. Thus, c-Jun is an cell-intrinsic determinant of Schwann cell morphology that controls the structure of the essential regeneration tracks that guide growing axons back to correct targets. c-Jun specification of gene expression and morphology of denervated cells suggested that Schwann cell c-Jun might exert a decisive control over nerve repair. Because survival of injured neurons is the basis for repair, we measured the survival of small and large dorsal root sensory (DRG) neurons following sciatic nerve crush at the sciatic notch. We counted axons in L4 dorsal roots (Coggeshall et al., 1997Coggeshall R.E. Lekan H.A. Doubell T.P. Allchorne A. Woolf C.J. Central changes in primary afferent fibers following peripheral nerve lesions.Neuroscience. 1997; 77: 1115-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and the tibial nerve, and neuronal somas and nucleoli in DRGs. Comparable results were obtained using all methods. Axon counts in WT dorsal roots showed that 20%–25% of the unmyelinated axons were lost following crush, as expected (Coggeshall et al., 1997Coggeshall R.E. Lekan H.A. Doubell T.P. Allchorne A. Woolf C.J. Central changes in primary afferent fibers following peripheral nerve lesions.Neuroscience. 1997; 77: 1115-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, 55%–60% of these axons were lost in c-Jun mutants, showing increased death of small DRG neurons in the mutant. This was confirmed by corrected (Abercrombie, 1946Abercrombie M. Estimation of nuclear population from microtome sections.Anat. Rec. 1946; 94: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar) counts of B neuron profiles in DRGs, showing 25%–30% loss in WT but 45%–65% loss in the mutants (Figures 4A and 4B ). The number of myelinated axons in dorsal roots remained unchanged in injured WT mice as expected (Coggeshall et al., 1997Coggeshall R.E. Lekan H.A. Doubell T.P. Allchorne A. Woolf C.J. Central changes in primary afferent fibers following peripheral nerve lesions.Neuroscience. 1997; 77: 1115-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). But surprisingly, in the mutants the number of myelinated axons was reduced by 30%–35%, indicating death of large DRG cells. In confirmation, the corrected number of large A cell profiles in DRGs was reduced by about 40% in the mutants. The number of these profiles did not change significantly in injured WT (Figures 4C and 4D). We also carried out counts on DRG sections using nucleoli as the counted entity, an approach that theoretically provides increased accuracy. Nucleoli in A type DRG neurons from uncut WT (n = 3), 10 week cut WT (n = 3), and 10 week cut c-Jun mutant (n = 3) mice were counted, corrected (Abercrombie, 1946Abercrombie M. Estimation of nuclear population from microtome sections.Anat. Rec. 1946; 94: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar), and expressed as percentage of uncut WT. This showed a 12% reduction in cut WT, (not significant; p > 0.40) but a 50% reduction in the c-Jun mutant (highly significant; p < 0.017). This provides a third line of evidence (in addition to counts of myelinated axons in dorsal roots and cell profiles) for the notion that nerve injury results in the loss of A type DRG neurons in mice that selectively lack c-Jun in Schwann cells. Consistent with neuronal death, the number of myelinated axons in the mutant tibial nerve 10 weeks after crush was reduced by about 35% and unmyelinated axons were reduced by about 65%, both compared to crushed WT controls (Figures 4E and 4F). These experiments show that without Schwann cell c-Jun, small, unmyelinated DRG neurons are about twice as likely to die following axonal damage. Significantly, about a third of the large, myelinated DRG neurons also die in crushed c-Jun mutants, although none die in injured WT controls, and in other studies these cells are resistant to death following axonal damage (Tandrup et al., 2000Tandrup T. Woolf C.J. Coggeshall R.E. Delayed loss of small dorsal root ganglion cells after transection of the rat sciatic nerve.J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 422: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These experiments establish that a key function of denervated Schwann cells is to prevent the death of injured neurons and that this rescue depends on c-Jun activation. The number of myelinated axons in ventral roots of both WT and mutant mice remained unchanged following sciatic nerve crush (Table S6). Therefore, unlike DRG neurons, survival of injured ventral horn motoneurons is independent of Schwann cell c-Jun. Nevertheless, the corrected (Abercrombie, 1946Abercrombie M. Estimation of nuclear population from microtome sections.Anat. Rec. 1946; 94: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar) counts of motoneurons that reconnected with the target muscle showed a large reduction in the mutant, even as late as 10 weeks after injury, reaching only about 55% of that in controls, judged by motoneuron backfilling (Figures 5A and 5B ). This indicates that in the mutants, axonal regeneration by surviving neurons is severely and permanently compromised. To analyze regeneration, we examined sciatic nerves 4 days after crush, using the nerve pinch test and by quantifying the number and length of axons in longitudinal sections immunolabeled by CGRP or galanin antibodies to label regenerating DRG and motoneurons. This showed a strong decrease in axon outgrowth in the mutants compared to WT (Figures 5C–5H). Regeneration in the mouse sciatic nerve is independent of Schwann cell proliferation (Kim et al., 2000Kim H.A. Pomeroy S.L. Whoriskey W. Pawlitzky I. Benowitz L.I. Sicinski P. Stiles C.D.

Cell. Neurosci. 2008; 38: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, because c-Jun contributes to proliferation in vitro (Parkinson et al., 2008Parkinson D.B. Bhaskaran A. Arthur-Farraj P. Noon L.A. Woodhoo A. Lloyd A.C. Feltri M.L. Wrabetz L. Behrens A. Mirsky R. Jessen K.R. c-Jun is a negative regulator of myelination.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), we counted Schwann cells in WT and mutant distal stumps (Table S7). In crushed, actively regenerating nerves (14 days after injury) Schwann cell numbers were not significantly different between WT and mutants; both were elevated 5- to 6-fold compared to uncut nerves. Four days after crush, cell numbers were higher in WT nerves, while 7 days after cut, again the difference between mutants and WT was not significant. The tendency toward lower Schwann cell numbers in the mutants is in line with the involvement of c-Jun in proliferation (Parkinson et al., 2004Parkinson D.B. Bhaskaran A. Droggiti A. Dickinson S. D’Antonio M. Mirsky R. Jessen K.R. Krox-20 inhibits Jun-NH2-terminal kinase/c-Jun to control Schwann cell proliferation and death.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Together this shows that in the absence of Schwann cell c-Jun, the regeneration of axons from surviving neurons is severely reduced, leading to a permanent deficit in the number of neurons that reconnect with denervated targets. The observation that that Schwann cell numbers in regenerating mutant nerves are elevated up to 5-fold compared to uninjured nerves, together with the independence of regeneration from elevated Schwann cell numbers (Kim et al., 2000Kim H.A. Pomeroy S.L. Whoriskey W. Pawlitzky I. Benowitz L.I. Sicinski P. Stiles C.D. Roberts T.M.

Cell. Neurosci. 2008; 38: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and analysis using microfluidic chambers (following section), shows that that regeneration failure in c-Jun mutants is not caused by lack of Schwann cells. A nerve is a complex cell community. We therefore used microfluidic chambers containing neurons and purified Schwann cells to test whether the poor axon growth in mutants was caused by disturbance of direct axon-Schwann cell interactions or whether the effect depended on other cells. Axon regeneration by axotomized, adult WT DRG neurons was strongly stimulated by control Schwann cells relative to laminin substrate alone, as expected (Figures 5I–5K). The c-Jun mutant cells, however, were ineffective, the number and area of axons extending on their surface falling to only 40%–50% of that seen on WT cells. Importantly, reactivation of c-Jun in mutant cells by adenoviral gene transfer, fully restored axon number and length to WT levels. These experiments show that injury-activated Schwann cell c-Jun controls direct communication between Schwann cells and growing neurites. We have shown that c-Jun controls three important functions of denervated Schwann cells, formation of regeneration tracks, support of neuronal survival, and promotion of axon regrowth. A fourth major role classically ascribed to these cells is removal of myelin and associated growth inhibitors, a task they accomplish by breaking down myelin early after injury and indirectly by instructing macrophages to complete myelin clearance (Hirata and Kawabuchi, 2002Hirata K. Kawabuchi M. Myelin phagocytosis by macrophages and nonmacrophages during Wallerian degeneration.Microsc. Res. Tech. 2002; 57: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We found that myelin clearance was substantially delayed in mutants. Four weeks after sciatic nerve transection (without regeneration), the distal stump of WT nerves was translucent, while mutant nerves remained gray/white (Figure 6A). Osmium stained lipid debris occupied about 10-fold larger area in the mutant than WT nerves (Figure 6B). Electron microscopy revealed that although transected mutant nerves did not contain intact myelin, many Schwann cells contained lipid droplets, a late product of myelin breakdown (Figure 6C). This was not seen in 4 week transected WT controls. We therefore tested whether myelin breakdown was impaired in mutant Schwann cells. First, in cut adult nerves, the loss of myelin sheaths was delayed in the mutants (Figure 6D). This was not due to infiltrating macrophages, because the difference between WT and mutants was fully maintained when the cut nerves were maintained in vitro (Figure 6E). Second, this delay was confirmed by slower breakdown of myelin basic protein (MBP) in vivo (Figures S5A and S5B). Third, when myelinating cells from postnatal day 8 nerves were cultured, myelin proteins were broken down slowly by c-Jun mutant cells compared to WT, and mutant cultures contained many Schwann cells bloated with myelin debris (Figures 6F–6H). Both types of culture contained similar numbers of F4/80+ macrophages (5.6+/−1.8% and 5.8+/−1.7%, n = 4, in WT and mutants, respectively, at 3 days in vitro), and no F4/80+ cells containing myelin proteins were seen, suggesting macrophages are not significantly involved in myelin breakdown in these experiments. These findings show that c-Jun mutant Schwann cells are deficient in their ability to break down myelin. Surprisingly, abnormalities in myelin breakdown extended to the macrophage compartment, although the macrophages are genetically normal (Figure S2). Four weeks after cut, macrophages in the mutants contained large amounts of myelin debris, and counts of lipid droplets per macrophage showed that they were about 7 times more numerous than in WT (Figures 6I and 6J). Furthermore, the number of very large (>150 μm2) foamy macrophages bloated with debris was elevated 3-fold in mutant nerves at this time point. Macrophage numbers in the distal stump were strongly elevated in both WT and c-Jun mutant nerves after injury. Three days after cut, their number close to the injury site was significantly higher in WT mice, and a migration assay using Boyden chambers showed that WT nerves attracted more macrophages than mutant nerves (Figures S5C and S5D). But at 1 and 6 weeks after cut, the number of macrophages was similar in WT and mutants, and at 4 and 14 days after crush, macrophage numbers were not significantly different (Table S7). RT-QPCR of cytokines in the distal stumps 36 hr after cut did not reveal significant differences between WT and mutants (Figure S5E). This indicates that c-Jun mutants do not suffer from a major failure in macrophage recruitment. Reduced numbers shortly after injury in the mutant might relate to lower Schwann cell numbers rather than to significant disturbance in the expression of macrophage attractants by individual cells. These results show that injured c-Jun mutant nerves develop substantial problems with myelin clearance. This is evident not only in Schwann cells but also in macrophages, an observation that suggests a role for Schwann cells in the control of macrophage activation and myelin degradation. Previous sections show that injury-activated Schwann cell c-Jun controls the generation of the dener"
https://openalex.org/W2143498816,"Uterine spiral artery remodeling is required for successful human pregnancy; impaired remodeling is associated with pregnancy complications, including late miscarriage, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. The molecular triggers of remodeling are not known, but it is now clear that there are ""trophoblast-independent"" and ""trophoblast-dependent"" stages. Uterine natural killer (uNK) cells are abundant in decidualized endometrium in early pregnancy; they surround spiral arteries and secrete a range of angiogenic growth factors. We hypothesized that uNK cells mediate the initial stages of spiral artery remodeling. uNK cells and extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells were isolated from early pregnancy decidua and placenta. Chorionic plate arteries from full-term placentas and spiral arteries from nonpregnant myometrium were cultured with angiogenic growth factors or conditioned medium (CM) from uNK cells or EVT or uNK cell/EVT cocultures. In both vessel models, uNK cell CM induced disruption of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and breakdown of extracellular matrix components. Angiopoietin (Ang)-1, Ang-2, interferon-γ, and VEGF-C also disrupted VSMC integrity with an Ang-2 inhibitor abrogating the effect of uNK cell CM. These results provide compelling evidence that uNK cells contribute to the early stages of spiral artery remodeling; failure of this process could contribute to pregnancy pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2098220565,"In plants, where cells cannot migrate, asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) must be confined to the appropriate spatial context. We investigate tissue-generating asymmetric divisions in a stem cell daughter within the Arabidopsis root. Spatial restriction of these divisions requires physical binding of the stem cell regulator SCARECROW (SCR) by the RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR) protein. In the stem cell niche, SCR activity is counteracted by phosphorylation of RBR through a cyclinD6;1-CDK complex. This cyclin is itself under transcriptional control of SCR and its partner SHORT ROOT (SHR), creating a robust bistable circuit with either high or low SHR-SCR complex activity. Auxin biases this circuit by promoting CYCD6;1 transcription. Mathematical modeling shows that ACDs are only switched on after integration of radial and longitudinal information, determined by SHR and auxin distribution, respectively. Coupling of cell-cycle progression to protein degradation resets the circuit, resulting in a ""flip flop"" that constrains asymmetric cell division to the stem cell region."

Here, we use next-generation sequencing, and Illumina and Affymetrix microarray platforms, to compare the transcriptome of human, chimpanzee, and macaque telencephalon. Our analysis reveals a predominance of genes differentially expressed within human frontal lobe and a striking increase in transcriptional complexity specific to the human lineage in the frontal lobe. In contrast, caudate nucleus gene expression is highly conserved. We also identify gene coexpression signatures related to either neuronal processes or neuropsychiatric diseases, including a human-specific module with CLOCK as its hub gene and another module enriched for neuronal morphological processes and genes coexpressed with FOXP2, a gene important for language evolution. These data demonstrate that transcriptional networks have undergone evolutionary remodeling even within a given brain region, providing a window through which to view the foundation of uniquely human cognitive capacities."
https://openalex.org/W2125490008,"Propagation of gene-expression patterns through the cell cycle requires the existence of an epigenetic mark that re-establishes the chromatin architecture of the parental cell in the daughter cells. We devised assays to determine which potential epigenetic marks associate with epigenetic maintenance elements during DNA replication in Drosophila embryos. Histone H3 trimethylated at lysines 4 or 27 is present during transcription but, surprisingly, is replaced by nonmethylated H3 following DNA replication. Methylated H3 is detected on DNA only in nuclei not in S phase. In contrast, the TrxG and PcG proteins Trithorax and Enhancer-of-Zeste, which are H3K4 and H3K27 methylases, and Polycomb continuously associate with their response elements on the newly replicated DNA. We suggest that histone modification enzymes may re-establish the histone code on newly assembled unmethylated histones and thus may act as epigenetic marks."
https://openalex.org/W2054347272,"The replay of previously stored memories during hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SWRs) is thought to support both memory retrieval and consolidation in distributed hippocampal-neocortical circuits. Replay events consist of precisely timed sequences of spikes from CA3 and CA1 neurons that are coordinated both within and across hemispheres. The mechanism of this coordination is not understood. Here, we show that during SWRs in both awake and quiescent states there are transient increases in slow gamma (20-50 Hz) power and synchrony across dorsal CA3 and CA1 networks of both hemispheres. These gamma oscillations entrain CA3 and CA1 spiking. Moreover, during awake SWRs, higher levels of slow gamma synchrony are predictive of higher quality replay of past experiences. Our results indicate that CA3-CA1 gamma synchronization is a central component of awake memory replay and suggest that transient gamma synchronization serves as a clocking mechanism to enable coordinated memory reactivation across the hippocampal network."
https://openalex.org/W2161515013,"Decision making is an important determinant of health and well-being across the lifespan but is critical in aging, when many influential decisions are made just as cognitive function declines. Increasing evidence suggests that older adults, even those without dementia, often make poor decisions and are selectively vulnerable to scams. To date, however, the factors associated with poor decision making in old age are unknown. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that poor decision making is a consequence of cognitive decline among older persons without Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment.Participants were 420 non-demented persons from the Memory and Aging Project, a longitudinal, clinical-pathologic cohort study of aging in the Chicago metropolitan area. All underwent repeated cognitive evaluations and subsequently completed assessments of decision making and susceptibility to scams. Decision making was measured using 12 items from a previously established performance-based measure and a self-report measure of susceptibility to scams.Cognitive function data were collected over an average of 5.5 years prior to the decision making assessment. Regression analyses were used to examine whether the prior rate of cognitive decline predicted the level of decision making and susceptibility to scams; analyses controlled for age, sex, education, and starting level of cognition. Among 420 persons without dementia, more rapid cognitive decline predicted poorer decision making and increased susceptibility to scams (p's<0.001). Further, the relations between cognitive decline, decision making and scams persisted in analyses restricted to persons without any cognitive impairment (i.e., no dementia or even mild cognitive impairment).Poor decision making is a consequence of cognitive decline among older persons without Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment, those widely considered ""cognitively healthy."" These findings suggest that even very subtle age-related changes in cognition have detrimental effects on judgment."
https://openalex.org/W2149572651,"Pheromone responses are highly context dependent. For example, the C. elegans pheromone ascaroside C9 (ascr#3) is repulsive to wild-type hermaphrodites, attractive to wild-type males, and usually neutral to ""social"" hermaphrodites with reduced activity of the npr-1 neuropeptide receptor gene. We show here that these distinct behavioral responses arise from overlapping push-pull circuits driven by two classes of pheromone-sensing neurons. The ADL sensory neurons detect C9 and, in wild-type hermaphrodites, drive C9 repulsion through their chemical synapses. In npr-1 mutant hermaphrodites, C9 repulsion is reduced by the recruitment of a gap junction circuit that antagonizes ADL chemical synapses. In males, ADL sensory responses are diminished; in addition, a second pheromone-sensing neuron, ASK, antagonizes C9 repulsion. The additive effects of these antagonistic circuit elements generate attractive, repulsive, or neutral pheromone responses. Neuronal modulation by circuit state and sex, and flexibility in synaptic output pathways, may permit small circuits to maximize their adaptive behavioral outputs."
https://openalex.org/W2050568934,"Both neuroprotective and neurotoxic roles have previously been described for histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1). Here we report that HDAC1 expression is elevated in vulnerable brain regions of two mouse models of neurodegeneration, the R6/2 model of Huntington disease and the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK)/p25 double-transgenic model of tauopathic degeneration, suggesting a role in promoting neuronal death. Indeed, elevating HDAC1 expression by ectopic expression promotes the death of otherwise healthy cerebellar granule neurons and cortical neurons in culture. The neurotoxic effect of HDAC1 requires interaction and cooperation with HDAC3, which has previously been shown to selectively induce the death of neurons. HDAC1-HDAC3 interaction is greatly elevated under conditions of neurodegeneration both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the knockdown of HDAC3 suppresses HDAC1-induced neurotoxicity, and the knockdown of HDAC1 suppresses HDAC3 neurotoxicity. As described previously for HDAC3, the neurotoxic effect of HDAC1 is inhibited by treatment with IGF-1, the expression of Akt, or the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). In addition to HDAC3, HDAC1 has been shown to interact with histone deacetylase-related protein (HDRP), a truncated form of HDAC9, whose expression is down-regulated during neuronal death. In contrast to HDAC3, the interaction between HDRP and HDAC1 protects neurons from death, an effect involving acquisition of the deacetylase activity of HDAC1 by HDRP. We find that elevated HDRP inhibits HDAC1-HDAC3 interaction and prevents the neurotoxic effect of either of these two proteins. Together, our results suggest that HDAC1 is a molecular switch between neuronal survival and death. Its interaction with HDRP promotes neuronal survival, whereas interaction with HDAC3 results in neuronal death."
https://openalex.org/W2013653029,"Brain abnormalities acquired early in life may cause schizophrenia, characterized by adulthood onset of psychosis, affective flattening, and cognitive impairments. Cognitive symptoms, like impaired cognitive control, are now recognized to be important treatment targets but cognition-promoting treatments are ineffective. We hypothesized that cognitive training during the adolescent period of neuroplastic development can tune compromised neural circuits to develop in the service of adult cognition and attenuate schizophrenia-related cognitive impairments that manifest in adulthood. We report, using neonatal ventral hippocampus lesion rats (NVHL), an established neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, that adolescent cognitive training prevented the adult cognitive control impairment in NVHL rats. The early intervention also normalized brain function, enhancing cognition-associated synchrony of neural oscillations between the hippocampi, a measure of brain function that indexed cognitive ability. Adolescence appears to be a critical window during which prophylactic cognitive therapy may benefit people at risk of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2090400710,"For the past 10 to 13 million years, Antarctic notothenioid fish have undergone extraordinary periods of evolution and have adapted to a cold and highly oxygenated Antarctic marine environment. While these species are considered an attractive model with which to study physiology and evolutionary adaptation, they are poorly characterized at the molecular level, and sequence information is lacking. The transcriptomes of the Antarctic fishes Notothenia coriiceps, Chaenocephalus aceratus, and Pleuragramma antarcticum were obtained by 454 FLX Titanium sequencing of a normalized cDNA library. More than 1,900,000 reads were assembled in a total of 71,539 contigs. Overall, 40% of the contigs were annotated based on similarity to known protein or nucleotide sequences, and more than 50% of the predicted transcripts were validated as full-length or putative full-length cDNAs. These three Antarctic fishes shared 663 genes expressed in the brain and 1,557 genes expressed in the liver. In addition, these cold-adapted fish expressed more Ub-conjugated proteins compared to temperate fish; Ub-conjugated proteins are involved in maintaining proteins in their native state in the cold and thermally stable Antarctic environments. Our transcriptome analysis of Antarctic notothenioid fish provides an archive for future studies in molecular mechanisms of fundamental genetic questions, and can be used in evolution studies comparing other fish."
https://openalex.org/W1983335488,"A major difficulty in treating cancer is the inability to differentiate between normal and tumor cells. The immune system differentiates tumor from normal cells by T cell receptor (TCR) binding of tumor-associated peptides bound to Major Histocompatibility Complex (pMHC) molecules. The peptides, derived from the tumor-specific proteins, are presented by MHC proteins, which then serve as cancer markers. The TCR is a difficult protein to use as a recombinant protein because of production issues and has poor affinity for pMHC; therefore, it is not a good choice for use as a tumor identifier outside of the immune system. We constructed a synthetic antibody-fragment (Fab) library in the phage-display format and isolated antibody-fragments that bind pMHC with high affinity and specificity. One Fab, fE75, recognizes our model cancer marker, the Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2/neu) peptide, E75, bound to the MHC called Human Leukocyte Antigen-A2 (HLA-A2), with nanomolar affinity. The fE75 bound selectively to E75/HLA-A2 positive cancer cell lines in vitro. The fE75 Fab conjugated with (64)Cu selectively accumulated in E75/HLA-A2 positive tumors and not in E75/HLA-A2 negative tumors in an HLA-A2 transgenic mouse as probed using positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging. Considering that hundreds to thousands of different peptides bound to HLA-A2 are present on the surface of each cell, the fact that fE75 arrives at the tumor at all shows extraordinary specificity. These antibody fragments have great potential for diagnosis and targeted drug delivery in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1969665042,"Visual cues often modulate auditory signal processing, leading to improved sound detection. However, the synaptic and circuit mechanism underlying this cross-modal modulation remains poorly understood. Using larval zebrafish, we first established a cross-modal behavioral paradigm in which a preceding flash enhances sound-evoked escape behavior, which is known to be executed through auditory afferents (VIIIth nerves) and command-like neurons (Mauthner cells). In vivo recording revealed that the visual enhancement of auditory escape is achieved by increasing sound-evoked Mauthner cell responses. This increase in Mauthner cell responses is accounted for by the increase in the signal-to-noise ratio of sound-evoked VIIIth nerve spiking and efficacy of VIIIth nerve-Mauthner cell synapses. Furthermore, the visual enhancement of Mauthner cell response and escape behavior requires light-responsive dopaminergic neurons in the caudal hypothalamus and D1 dopamine receptor activation. Our findings illustrate a cooperative neural mechanism for visual modulation of audiomotor processing that involves dopaminergic neuromodulation."
https://openalex.org/W2089269684,"Zinc homeostasis is essential for fungal growth, as this metal is a critical structural component of several proteins, including transcription factors. The fungal pathogen Cryptococcus gattii obtains zinc from the stringent zinc-limiting milieu of the host during the infection process. To characterize the zinc metabolism in C. gattii and its relationship to fungal virulence, the zinc finger protein Zap1 was functionally characterized. The C. gattii ZAP1 gene is an ortholog of the master regulatory genes zafA and ZAP1 that are found in Aspergillus fumigatus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively. There is some evidence to support an association between Zap1 and zinc metabolism in C. gattii: (i) ZAP1 expression is highly induced during zinc deprivation, (ii) ZAP1 knockouts demonstrate impaired growth in zinc-limiting conditions, (iii) Zap1 regulates the expression of ZIP zinc transporters and distinct zinc-binding proteins and (iv) Zap1 regulates the labile pool of intracellular zinc. In addition, the deletion of ZAP1 reduces C. gattii virulence in a murine model of cryptococcosis infection. Based on these observations, we postulate that proper zinc metabolism plays a crucial role in cryptococcal virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2053658035,"N-type voltage-gated calcium channels localize to presynaptic nerve terminals and mediate key events including synaptogenesis and neurotransmission. While several kinases have been implicated in the modulation of calcium channels, their impact on presynaptic functions remains unclear. Here we report that the N-type calcium channel is a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). The pore-forming α(1) subunit of the N-type calcium channel is phosphorylated in the C-terminal domain, and phosphorylation results in enhanced calcium influx due to increased channel open probability. Phosphorylation of the N-type calcium channel by Cdk5 facilitates neurotransmitter release and alters presynaptic plasticity by increasing the number of docked vesicles at the synaptic cleft. These effects are mediated by an altered interaction between N-type calcium channels and RIM1, which tethers presynaptic calcium channels to the active zone. Collectively, our results highlight a molecular mechanism by which N-type calcium channels are regulated by Cdk5 to affect presynaptic function."
https://openalex.org/W2108878645,"When it is difficult to develop selective ligands within a family of related G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), chemically engineered receptors activated solely by synthetic ligands (RASSLs) are useful alternatives for probing receptor function. In the present work, we explored whether a RASSL of the free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2) could be developed on the basis of pharmacological variation between species orthologs. For this, bovine FFA2 was characterized, revealing distinct ligand selectivity compared with human FFA2. Homology modeling and mutational analysis demonstrated a single mutation in human FFA2 of C4.57G resulted in a human FFA2 receptor with ligand selectivity similar to the bovine receptor. This was exploited to generate human FFA2-RASSL by the addition of a second mutation at a known orthosteric ligand interaction site, H6.55Q. The resulting FFA2-RASSL displayed a >100-fold loss of activity to endogenous ligands, while responding to the distinct ligand sorbic acid with pEC50 values for inhibition of cAMP, 5.83 ± 0.11; Ca2+ mobilization, 4.63 ± 0.05; ERK phosphorylation, 5.61 ± 0.06; and dynamic mass redistribution, 5.35 ± 0.06. This FFA2-RASSL will be useful in future studies on this receptor and demonstrates that exploitation of pharmacological variation between species orthologs is a powerful method to generate novel chemically engineered GPCRs.—Hudson, B.

The neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the learning of time are unknown. We used functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging to investigate neurophysiological changes and individual brain differences underlying the learning of time in the millisecond range. We found that the representation of a trained visual temporal interval was associated with functional and structural changes in a sensory-motor network including occipital, parietal, and insular cortices, plus the cerebellum. We show that both types of neurophysiological changes correlated with changes of performance accuracy and that activity and gray-matter volume of sensorimotor cortices predicted individual learning abilities. These findings represent neurophysiological evidence of functional and structural plasticity associated with the learning of time in humans and highlight the role of sensory-motor circuits in the perceptual representation of time in the millisecond range."
https://openalex.org/W2093922849,"The accumulation of amyloid fibrils is a feature of amyloid diseases, where cell toxicity is due to soluble oligomeric species that precede fibril formation or are formed by fibril fragmentation, but the mechanism(s) of fragmentation is still unclear. Neutrophil-derived elastase and histones were found in amyloid deposits from patients with different systemic amyloidoses. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are key players in a death mechanism in which neutrophils release DNA traps decorated with proteins such as elastase and histones to entangle pathogens. Here, we asked whether NETs are triggered by amyloid fibrils, reasoning that because proteases are present in NETs, protease digestion of amyloid may generate soluble, cytotoxic species. We show that amyloid fibrils from three different sources (α-synuclein, Sup35, and transthyretin) induced NADPH oxidase-dependent NETs in vitro from human neutrophils. Surprisingly, NET-associated elastase digested amyloid fibrils into short species that were cytotoxic for BHK-21 and HepG2 cells. In tissue sections from patients with primary amyloidosis, we also observed the co-localization of NETs with amyloid deposits as well as with oligomers, which are probably derived from elastase-induced fibril degradation (amyloidolysis). These data reveal that release of NETs, so far described to be elicited by pathogens, can also be triggered by amyloid fibrils. Moreover, the involvement of NETs in amyloidoses might be crucial for the production of toxic species derived from fibril fragmentation."
https://openalex.org/W1971460289,"Extracellular matrix (ECM) production is critical to preserve the function and integrity of mature blood vessels. Toward the engineering of blood vessels, studies have centered on ECM production by supporting cells, whereas few studies implicate endothelial cells (ECs) with ECM synthesis. Here, we elucidate variations between cultured human arterial, venous, and progenitor ECs with respect to ECM deposition assembly, composition, and response to biomolecular and physiological factors. Our studies reveal that progenitor ECs, endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs), deposit collagen IV, fibronectin, and laminin that assemble to an organized weblike structure, as confirmed by decellularized cultures. Mature ECs only express these ECM proteins intracellularly. ECFC-derived ECM is abrogated in response to TGFβ signaling inhibition and actin cytoskeleton disruption. Hypoxic (1%) and physiological (5%) O(2) tension stimulate ECM deposition from mature ECs. Interestingly, deposition of collagen I is observed only under 5% O(2) tension. ECM production from all ECs is found to be regulated by hypoxia-inducible factors 1α and 2α but differentially in the different cell lines. Collectively, we suggest that ECM deposition and assembly by ECs is dependent on maturation stage and oxygen supply and that these findings can be harnessed to advance engineered vascular therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2094157899,"An enduring problem in avian ecology and conservation is linking breeding and wintering grounds of migratory species. As migratory species and populations vary in the degree to which individuals from distinct breeding locales mix on stop-over sites and wintering grounds, establishing migratory connectivity informs our understanding of population demography and species management. We present a new Bayesian approach for inferring breeding grounds of wintering birds of unknown origins in North America. We incorporate prior information from analysis of genetic markers into geographic origin assignment based upon stable-hydrogen isotope analysis of feathers (δ(2)H(f)), using the Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus). Likely geographic origins derived from analyses of DNA microsatellites were used as priors for Bayesian analyses in which birds were assigned to a breeding-ground origin using their δ(2)H(f) values. As with most applications of Bayesian methods, our approach greatly improved the results (i.e. decreased the size of the potential area of origin). Area of origin decreased by 3 to 5-fold on average, but ranged up to a 10-fold improvement. We recommend this approach in future studies of migratory connectivity and suggest that our methodology could be applied more broadly to the study of dispersal, sources of productivity of migratory populations, and a range of evolutionary phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W1984699853,"Pheromones elicit innate sex-specific mating behaviors in many species. We demonstrate that in C. elegans, male-specific sexual attraction behavior is programmed in both sexes but repressed in hermaphrodites. Repression requires a single sensory neuron pair, the ASIs. To repress attraction in adults, the ASIs must be present, active, and capable of sensing the environment during development. The ASIs release TGF-β, and ASI function can be bypassed by experimental activation of TGF-β signaling. Sexual attraction in derepressed hermaphrodites requires the same sensory neurons as in males. The sexual identity of both these sensory neurons and a distinct subset of interneurons must be male to relieve repression and release attraction. TGF-β may therefore act to change connections between sensory neurons and interneurons during development to engage repression. Thus, sensation in a single sensory neuron pair during development reprograms a common neural circuit from male to female behavior. Pheromones elicit innate sex-specific mating behaviors in many species. We demonstrate that in C. elegans, male-specific sexual attraction behavior is programmed in both sexes but repressed in hermaphrodites. Repression requires a single sensory neuron pair, the ASIs.

TGF-β may therefore act to change connections between sensory neurons and interneurons during development to engage repression. Thus, sensation in a single sensory neuron pair during development reprograms a common neural circuit from male to female behavior. Male sexual attraction is latent in the hermaphrodite brain but normally repressed Two sensory neurons, the ASIs, release TGF-β during development to engage repression Males express TGF-β, but repression acts only on the hermaphrodite nervous system Sexual attraction requires distributed sex differences in sensory and interneurons In most species, males and females display sex-specific behavioral repertoires. Courtship and mating behaviors elicited by pheromones are among the most obvious sexually dimorphic repertoires because they are innate and stereotyped (Stowers and Logan, 2010Stowers L. Logan D.W. Sexual dimorphism in olfactory signaling.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2010; 20: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). What are the neural differences that give rise to different behaviors in each sex? Behavioral differences could be due to differences in the ability of each sex to detect pheromone or to differences in the processing of pheromone sensory information. For example, female mice with an impaired vomeronasal organ exhibit male mating behaviors, suggesting that the underlying neural circuitry is the same in both sexes but only active in males (Kimchi et al., 2007Kimchi T. Xu J. Dulac C. A functional circuit underlying male sexual behaviour in the female mouse brain.Nature. 2007; 448: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). It may be that females are capable of smelling pheromones that males cannot and that smelling these compounds represses male mating. In this case, the difference is at the level of detection. Alternatively, male flies detect pheromone identically to females (Kurtovic et al., 2007Kurtovic A. Widmer A. Dickson B.J. A single class of olfactory neurons mediates behavioural responses to a Drosophila sex pheromone.Nature. 2007; 446: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) but possess male-specific ganglia that initiate male courtship behavior (Clyne and Miesenböck, 2008Clyne J.D.

Female contact activates male-specific interneurons that trigger stereotypic courtship behavior in Drosophila.Neuron. 2011; 69: 498-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), even in an animal that is otherwise female (Kimura et al., 2008Kimura K.

Fruitless and doublesex coordinate to generate male-specific neurons that can initiate courtship.Neuron. 2008; 59: 759-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Here, both sexes smell the same compound, cis-vaccenyl acetate, but male and female higher brain centers generate different responses (Kurtovic et al., 2007Kurtovic A. Widmer A. Dickson B.J. A single class of olfactory neurons mediates behavioural responses to a Drosophila sex pheromone.Nature. 2007; 446: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Thus, in this case, the difference is at the level of processing. The two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. In Manduca sexta, transplanting the nascent male sensory apparatus (his antennae) to a female larva induces male development in the female brain, and the adult animal has male behaviors (Schneiderman et al., 1986Schneiderman A.M. Hildebrand J.G. Brennan M.M. Tumlinson J.H. Trans-sexually grafted antennae alter pheromone-directed behaviour in a moth.Nature. 1986; 323: 801-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The reciprocal switch generates an animal that has female behaviors (Kalberer et al., 2010Kalberer N.M. Reisenman C.E. Hildebrand J.G. Male moths bearing transplanted female antennae express characteristically female behaviour and central neural activity.J. Exp. Biol. 2010; 213: 1272-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this case, a difference in detection induces sexually dimorphic wiring, resulting in a difference in processing. Behavior that depends only on differences in detection could be easily modulated, for example, by regulating chemoreceptor expression. Behavior that is dependent on sex-specific brain structures must be hardwired during development, and the different contributions of sex-determination pathways and the environment to this hardwiring are not clear. Here, we address these fundamental questions in C. elegans, an animal with relatively few sex-specific neurons but a rich sex-specific behavioral repertoire. C. elegans reproduces both as a self-fertilizing hermaphrodite and by mating between hermaphrodites and males. C. elegans hermaphrodites are essentially females that make their own sperm for a short time during development, which they store to later fertilize their own eggs (for review, see Herman, 2005Herman, R.K. (2005). Introduction to sex determination. In WormBook, The C. elegans Research Community, ed. http://dx.doi.org/10.1895/wormbook.1.71.1, http://www.wormbook.org.Google Scholar). Hermaphrodites release pheromones that elicit behaviors in both sexes. Hermaphrodite pheromones fall into two broad classes: daf-22 dependent (Butcher et al., 2009Butcher R.A. Ragains J.R. Li W.

The daf-22-dependent class of pheromones appears to act as density signals that mediate both development and behavior (Srinivasan et al., 2012Srinivasan J. von Reuss S.H. Bose N. Zaslaver A.

Nicholas T.J. Gritton J. Truong L. Davidson E.R. Jorgensen E.M. The sensory circuitry for sexual attraction in C. elegans males.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1847-1857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As in many species, both sexes are exposed to sex pheromones, but they compel sexual attraction only in males. The mechanism by which male-specific sexual attraction behavior is established in C. elegans is unknown. We surveyed existing C. elegans mutants for those with altered sexual attraction and found that daf-7 mutant hermaphrodites show sexual attraction behavior (Figure 1A). That is, daf-7 mutant hermaphrodites are attracted to sex pheromones, whereas wild-type hermaphrodites are not. In daf-7 males, sexual attraction is not detectably altered (see Figure S1 available online). Thus, the absence of DAF-7/TGF-β reveals latent sexual attraction behavior in hermaphrodites. Sexual attraction requires the same neurons in males and daf-7 hermaphrodites. Most of the C. elegans nervous system is the same in both sexes (Sulston et al., 1983Sulston J.E. Schierenberg E. White J.G. Thomson J.N. The embryonic cell lineage of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Dev. Biol. 1983; 100: 64-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2795) Google Scholar): 294 neurons comprise this core nervous system (out of 302 total in the hermaphrodite). In males, sexual attraction requires the core sensory neurons AWA, AWC, and ASK, and although male-specific sensory neurons normally contribute, these core sensory neurons are sufficient (White et al., 2007White J.Q. Nicholas T.J. Gritton J. Truong L. Davidson E.R. Jorgensen E.M. The sensory circuitry for sexual attraction in C. elegans males.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1847-1857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar; Figure S2). Furthermore, if any of these core neurons are surgically ablated in juvenile males, the remaining neurons compensate and the operated adults express full sexual attraction. As in males, in daf-7 hermaphrodites sexual attraction requires the core sensory neurons AWA, AWC, and ASK (Figure 1B). Furthermore, as in males, in daf-7 mutant hermaphrodites, these sensory neurons compensate for one another (Figure 1B). If only one pair is removed late in development (L4 larval stage), the circuit is disrupted and behavior is compromised. However, if only one pair is removed early in development (L3 larval stage), the remaining pairs take over and behavior is not detectably affected, unless all three pairs are removed concurrently. Although other explanations for attraction in daf-7 hermaphrodites are formally possible, such as altered chemoreceptor expression (Nolan et al., 2002Nolan K.M. Sarafi-Reinach T.R. Horne J.G. Saffer A.M. Sengupta P. The DAF-7 TGF-β signaling pathway regulates chemosensory receptor gene expression in C. elegans.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3061-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), it is striking that the same distinct set of sensory neurons are required and show the same property of compensation. Given these results, it is likely that the same neural circuit generates sexual attraction in both males and daf-7 hermaphrodites. The sole source of DAF-7/TGF-β in C. elegans is the ASI sensory neuron pair (Ren et al., 1996Ren P. Lim C.S. Johnsen R. Albert P.S. Pilgrim D. Riddle D.L.

Chemosensory neurons function in parallel to mediate a pheromone response in C. elegans.Neuron. 1996; 17: 719-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Ablation of the ASI neurons reveals sexual attraction in hermaphrodites (Figure 2A). That is, ASI-ablated hermaphrodites are attracted to sex pheromones, whereas intact hermaphrodites are not. Sexual attraction in ASI-ablated hermaphrodites requires the ASK, AWA, and AWC neurons (Figure 2A). The ASI neurons express a cGMP-gated channel containing the TAX-4 subunit (Komatsu et al., 1996Komatsu H. Mori I. Rhee J.S. Akaike N. Ohshima Y.

This channel is required for ASI development and activity (Coburn and Bargmann, 1996Coburn C.M. Bargmann C.I.

Zallen J.A. Yarrow J.C. Bargmann C.I. Sensory activity affects sensory axon development in C. elegans.Development. 1999; 126: 1891-1902PubMed Google Scholar) but makes only a residual contribution to sexual attraction in males (White et al., 2007White J.Q. Nicholas T.J. Gritton J. Truong L. Davidson E.R. Jorgensen E.M. The sensory circuitry for sexual attraction in C. elegans males.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1847-1857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Mutant tax-4 hermaphrodites show sexual attraction behavior (Figure 2B). Attraction in tax-4 hermaphrodites is not as consistent as in daf-7 hermaphrodites, suggesting that—as in males—TAX-4 may also function in cells that promote attraction. Expression of TAX-4 in ASI neurons completely restored wild-type behavior to tax-4 mutant hermaphrodites (Figure 2B; “wild-type behavior” means that attraction is repressed), but expression in other neurons, such as ASK, did not. Thus, TAX-4 function solely in the ASIs is sufficient to repress attraction. The ASIs are classified as sensory neurons in part because they have dendrites exposed to the external environment (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sensory dendrites in ASI require the OSM-3 kinesin to develop properly; osm-3 mutants have stunted sensory endings (Snow et al., 2004Snow J.J. Ou G. Gunnarson A.L. Walker M.R. Zhou H.M. Brust-Mascher I. Scholey J.M. Two anterograde intraflagellar transport motors cooperate to build sensory cilia on C. elegans neurons.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), but OSM-3 is not required in males for sexual attraction (White et al., 2007White J.Q. Nicholas T.J. Gritton J. Truong L. Davidson E.R. Jorgensen E.M. The sensory circuitry for sexual attraction in C. elegans males.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1847-1857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). osm-3 mutant hermaphrodites exhibit sexual attraction behavior (Figure 2C), most likely because their ASI neurons are not sensing the external environment and so do not engage repression. Thus, ASI neurons must be (1) present during development, (2) active, and (3) capable of sensing the external environment in order to repress sexual attraction in adult hermaphrodites. To repress sexual attraction, the ASI pair could act solely by releasing DAF-7/TGF-β or it could have additional roles. To separate the functions of DAF-7 from the ASI neurons, we experimentally activated TGF-β signaling independent of the ASIs in two ways. First, we expressed DAF-7/TGF-β specifically in the AWC and ASE sensory neurons, but not in ASI, in daf-7 mutant animals. As expected, DAF-7/TGF-β expression in the AWC and ASE neurons rescues three classic phenotypes of daf-7 mutants: (1) inappropriate induction of dauer larvae, (2) a dark intestine, and (3) aggregation. Importantly, DAF-7/TGF-β expression in the AWC and ASE neurons also rescues wild-type behavior in daf-7 mutant hermaphrodites: transgenic hermaphrodites are not attracted to sex pheromones (Figure 2D). Notably, ablation of the ASI neurons has no discernible effect on the attraction behavior of these transgenic hermaphrodites; sexual attraction is repressed regardless of whether ASI is present (Figure 2D). Second, we activated TGF-β signaling using genetics: in a daf-3 mutant, the absence of DAF-3 function activates the DAF-7 signaling pathway in target cells, independent of DAF-7 (Thomas et al., 1993Thomas J.H. Birnby D.A. Vowels J.J. Evidence for parallel processing of sensory information controlling dauer formation in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 1993; 134: 1105-1117PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, daf-7; daf-3 double mutant hermaphrodites have repressed sexual attraction (Figure 2D). That is, daf-7; daf-3 hermaphrodites are no longer attracted to sex pheromones. Their brothers, daf-7; daf-3 double mutant males, exhibit obvious sexual attraction behavior (Figure 2D) comparable to daf-3 single mutant males (data not shown). Thus, although ASI activity normally modulates expression and release of DAF-7/TGF-β (Chang et al., 2006Chang A.J. Chronis N. Karow D.S. Marletta M.A. Bargmann C.I. A distributed chemosensory circuit for oxygen preference in C. elegans.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e274Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar; Schackwitz et al., 1996Schackwitz W.S. Inoue T. Thomas J.H. Chemosensory neurons function in parallel to mediate a pheromone response in C. elegans.Neuron. 1996; 17: 719-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), ASI activity may be bypassed either by forcing expression of DAF-7/TGF-β elsewhere or by activating TGF-β signaling. Therefore, the sole role of ASI in repressing sexual attraction is to release DAF-7/TGF-β. To establish sexually dimorphic behavior, DAF-7/TGF-β could alter how the underlying neural circuit is built, how it is maintained, or how it is modulated. To address these possibilities, we determined when the nervous system must be sexualized to generate sexual attraction behavior. At different times during development, we masculinized the hermaphrodite nervous system using a FLP-ON strategy (Davis et al., 2008Davis M.W. Morton J.J. Carroll D. Jorgensen E.M. Gene activation using FLP recombinase in C. elegans.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000028Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Sexual attraction behavior emerges in adults when the nervous system is switched during development (during the final L4 larval stage or earlier), but not when switched in adults (Figure 3). Consistent with these results, sexual attraction is revealed in adult hermaphrodites only when the ASI neurons are ablated during development (prior to the L4 larval stage or earlier), not when ablated in adults (Figure 2A). The requirement for the ASI neurons during development coincides with the time when they express DAF-7/TGF-β (Ren et al., 1996Ren P. Lim C.S. Johnsen R. Albert P.S. Pilgrim D. Riddle D.L. Control of C. elegans larval development by neuronal expression of a TGF-β homolog.Science. 1996; 274: 1389-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar; Schackwitz et al., 1996Schackwitz W.S. Inoue T. Thomas J.H. Chemosensory neurons function in parallel to mediate a pheromone response in C. elegans.Neuron. 1996; 17: 719-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Therefore, DAF-7/TGF-β most likely alters how the sexual attraction circuits are built. To localize neural sex differences required for sexual attraction behavior, we masculinized subsets of neurons in animals that were otherwise hermaphrodites. We focused on the sensory neurons required for sexual attraction behavior (AWA, AWC, and ASK) and the interneurons that comprise their synaptic targets and gap-junction partners (Figure 4A). Because the male wiring diagram is incomplete, connectivity information is based on the hermaphrodite wiring diagram (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Chen et al., 2006Chen B.L. Hall D.H. Chklovskii D.B. Wiring optimization can relate neuronal structure and function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 4723-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Using cell-selective promotors, we masculinized sets of sensory neurons and interneurons in different combinations (Experimental Procedures; Figure 4B). Hermaphrodites with masculinized AWA, AWC, ASK, and ASI sensory neurons exhibited no detectable sexual attraction (using Podr-4, Figure 4C). That is, attraction remained repressed in these animals. Likewise, hermaphrodites in which a broad set of interneurons were masculinized also exhibited no detectable sexual attraction (using a combination of Pglr-2, Pglr-5, and Pser-2b). In contrast, hermaphrodites in which both sensory neurons and interneurons were masculinized exhibited robust sexual attraction (Figures 4B and 4C, using a combination of Podr-4, Pglr-2, Pglr-5, and Pser-2b), indistinguishable from male controls (Figure 4C) and comparable to masculinization of the entire nervous system using Prab-3 (White et al., 2007White J.Q. Nicholas T.J. Gritton J. Truong L. Davidson E.R. Jorgensen E.M. The sensory circuitry for sexual attraction in C. elegans males.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1847-1857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The particular set of interneurons is important, because masculinizing the Podr-4 sensory neurons together with Punc-17 interneurons and motor neurons did not enable expression of sexual attraction; the behavior remained repressed. Thus, both sensory neurons and interneurons must be male for male-specific sexual attraction to emerge. Masculinization of only the Podr-4 sensory neuron set—which includes both ASI and the sensory neurons required for sexual attraction—is not sufficient. Likewise, masculinization of only an interneuron set—regardless of which—is not sufficient. If either set has a female sexual identity, DAF-7/TGF-β can act—either directly or indirectly—to repress sexual attraction in hermaphrodites. If pheromone sensory input converges on a single interneuron pair that functions, for example, as a modulatory hub (Macosko et al., 2009Macosko E.Z. Pokala N. Feinberg E.H. Chalasani S.H. Butcher R.A. Clardy J. Bargmann C.I. A hub-and-spoke circuit drives pheromone attraction and social behaviour in C. elegans.Nature. 2009; 458: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) or a site of integration (Shinkai et al., 2011Shinkai Y. Yamamoto Y. Fujiwara M. Tabata T. Murayama T. Hirotsu T. Ikeda D.D. Tsunozaki M. Iino Y. Bargmann C.I. et al.Behavioral choice between conflicting alternatives is regulated by a receptor guanylyl cyclase, GCY-28, and a receptor tyrosine kinase, SCD-2, in AIA interneurons of Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 3007-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), then these neurons might also be the site of the sex differences that account for sexual attraction. To address this, we masculinized a constant set of sensory neurons (using Podr-4) in combination with smaller subsets of interneurons. Based on the hermaphrodite wiring diagram (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Chen et al., 2006Chen B.L. Hall D.H. Chklovskii D.B. Wiring optimization can relate neuronal structure and function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 4723-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), the most heavily connected interneurons that are directly postsynaptic to the AWA, AWC, and ASK sensory neurons are the AIA, AIB, AIY, and AIZ pairs (Figure 4A). Notably, no single interneuron class is postsynaptic to all three sensory neuron classes. In addition, the RMG interneuron pair modulates signaling from the ASKs via gap junctions (Macosko et al., 2009Macosko E.Z. Pokala N. Feinberg E.H. Chalasani S.H. Butcher R.A. Clardy J. Bargmann C.I. A hub-and-spoke circuit drives pheromone attraction and social behaviour in C. elegans.Nature. 2009; 458: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). A subset that should masculinize all of the AIA, AIB, AIY, and AIZ neurons but not the RMG interneurons (Pglr-2 + Pser-2b) fully expressed sexual attraction, comparable to broad masculinization (Pglr-2 + Pglr-5 + Pser-2b). That is, repression was not engaged. Subsets that should masculinize only some of the AIA, AIB, AIY, and AIZ neurons and include the RMG neurons also fully expressed sexual attraction (the Pglr-5 + Pglr-2 and Pglr-2 + Pser-2b combinations). In contrast, subsets that should masculinize only some of the AIA, AIB, AIY, and AIZ neurons but do not include RMG expressed sexual attraction less frequently (Pglr-2) or not at all (Pser-2b). Conversely, a subset that should masculinize RMG, but not AIA, AIY, and AIZ (and possibly not AIB; Pglr-5), did not exhibit sexual attraction. Within the framework provided by the hermaphrodite wiring diagram (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Chen et al., 2006Chen B.L. Hall D.H. Chklovskii D.B. Wiring optimization can relate neuronal structure and function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 4723-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), a straightforward interpretation of these results is that sexual differences in AIA and AIB are most important for sexual attraction, with contributions from AIY and AIZ and possibly modulation by RMG. Independent of the hermaphrodite wiring, it appears unlikely that pheromone sensory input converges on a single interneuron class but instead remains distributed. Taken together, the neuron-selective masculinization experiments suggest that the AWA, AWC, and ASK sensory neurons and their interneuron partners—most likely the AIA, AIB, AIY, and AIZ neurons—must be male for the animal to display male behavior. A simple model based on these data is that a male-specific constellation of connections among these sensory neurons and interneurons forms during development to generate male-specific sexual attraction (Figure 4D). In this model, hermaphrodites are also capable of developing these connections, but repression either prevents them from being established or subsequently disables them. In general, sex-specific behaviors may be generated by extra circuitry entirely present only in one sex or by modification of circuitry present in both sexes (Stowers and Logan, 2010Stowers L. Logan D.W. Sexual dimorphism in olfactory signaling.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2010; 20: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, there a"

This study aimed to identify the cell types responsible for cardiac telomerase activity in neonatal, adult, and cryoinjured adult hearts using transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), driven by the promoter for murine telomerase reverse transcriptase (mTert), which is a necessary and rate-limiting component of telomerase. A rare population of mTert-GFP-expressing cells was identified that possessed all detectable cardiac telomerase RNA and telomerase activity. It was heterogeneous and included cells coexpressing markers of cardiomyocytic, endothelial, and mesenchymal lineages, putative cardiac stem cell markers, and, interestingly, cardiomyocytes with a differentiated phenotype. Quantification using both flow cytometry and immunofluorescence identified a significant decline in mTert-GFP cells in adult animals compared to neonates (~9- and ~20-fold, respectively). Cardiac injury resulted in a ~6.45-fold expansion of this population (P<0.005) compared with sham-operated controls. This study identifies the cells responsible for cardiac telomerase activity, demonstrates a significant diminution with age but a marked response to injury, and, given the relationship between telomerase activity and stem cell populations, suggests that they represent a potential target for further investigation of cardiac regenerative potential.—Richardson, G.

https://openalex.org/W2151800337,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is a typical childhood and heterogeneous neoplasm for which efficient targeted therapies for high-risk tumors are not yet identified. The chemokine CXCL12, and its receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 have been involved in tumor progression and dissemination. While CXCR4 expression is associated to undifferentiated tumors and poor prognosis, the role of CXCR7, the recently identified second CXCL12 receptor, has not yet been elucidated in NB. In this report, CXCR7 and CXCL12 expressions were evaluated using a tissue micro-array including 156 primary and 56 metastatic NB tissues. CXCL12 was found to be highly associated to NB vascular and stromal structures. In contrast to CXCR4, CXCR7 expression was low in undifferentiated tumors, while its expression was stronger in matured tissues and specifically associated to differentiated neural tumor cells. As determined by RT-PCR, CXCR7 expression was mainly detected in N-and S-type NB cell lines, and was slightly induced upon NB cell differentiation in vitro. The relative roles of the two CXCL12 receptors were further assessed by overexpressing CXCR7 or CXCR4 receptor alone, or in combination, in the IGR-NB8 and the SH-SY5Y NB cell lines. In vitro functional analyses indicated that, in response to their common ligand, both receptors induced activation of ERK1/2 cascade, but not Akt pathway. CXCR7 strongly reduced in vitro growth, in contrast to CXCR4, and impaired CXCR4/CXCL12-mediated chemotaxis. Subcutaneous implantation of CXCR7-expressing NB cells showed that CXCR7 also significantly reduced in vivo growth. Moreover, CXCR7 affected CXCR4-mediated orthotopic growth in a CXCL12-producing environment. In such model, CXCR7, in association with CXCR4, did not induce NB cell metastatic dissemination. In conclusion, the CXCR7 and CXCR4 receptors revealed specific expression patterns and distinct functional roles in NB. Our data suggest that CXCR7 elicits anti-tumorigenic functions, and may act as a regulator of CXCR4/CXCL12-mediated signaling in NB."

The present study investigates endothelial cells isolated from such material as well as factors present in the surgical PEA material, which may contribute to impairment of recanalization and thrombus non-resolution. We observed muscularized vessels and non-muscularized vessels in the PEA material. The isolated endothelial cells from the PEA material showed significantly different calcium homeostasis as compared to pulmonary artery endothelial cells (hPAECs) from normal controls. In the supernatant (ELISA) as well as on the tissue level (histochemical staining) of the PEA material, platelet factor 4 (PF4), collagen type I and interferon-gamma-inducible 10 kD protein (IP-10) were detected. CXCR3, the receptor for PF4 and IP-10, was particularly elevated in the distal parts of the PEA material as compared to human control lung (RT-PCR). PF4, collagen type I and IP-10 caused significant changes in calcium homeostasis and affected the cell proliferation, migration and vessel formation in hPAECs. The presence of angiostatic factors like PF4, collagen type I and IP-10, as recovered from the surgical PEA material from CTEPH patients, may lead to changes in calcium homeostasis and endothelial dysfunction."

Methodology/Principal Finding A prospective cohort study was performed in 107 women with PPROM between 23.0 and 36.6 weeks of gestational age. Twenty-six proteins were assayed by multiple immunoassay in amniotic fluid. The policy for PPROM in Czech Republic is active, and 90% of the women were delivered within 96 hours of membrane rupture. Histopathological placental findings were evaluated based on the Salafia classification. Data were analyzed in four subgroups of population according to the presence of MIAC and/or HCA. Results were stratified by gestational age at PPROM (< or ≥34.0 weeks). The rates of MIAC and HCA were 44% and 57%, respectively. Regardless of gestational age at PPROM, intra-amniotic inflammatory response was higher when MIAC and HCA were both present. There were no differences in the intra-amniotic inflammatory response between women with MIAC or HCA alone and women without infection. Conclusion A higher intra-amniotic inflammatory response was identified when both HCA and MIAC were detected."

Genuine and putative gene transfer agents have been discovered in diverse genera and are becoming recognized as potentially an important source of genetic exchange and microbial evolution in the oceans. Despite being discovered over 30 years ago, little is known about many essential aspects of RcGTA biology. Here, we validate the use of direct fluorescence reporter constructs, which express the red fluorescent protein mCherry in R. capsulatus. A construct containing the RcGTA promoter fused to mCherry was used to examine the single-cell expression profiles of wild type and RcGTA overproducer R. capsulatus populations, under different growth conditions and growth phases. The majority of RcGTA production clearly arises from a small, distinct sub-set of the population in the wild type strain and a larger sub-set in the overproducer. The most likely RcGTA release mechanism concomitant with this expression pattern is host cell lysis and we present direct evidence for the release of an intracellular enzyme accompanying RcGTA release. RcGTA ORF s is annotated as a ‘cell wall peptidase’ but we rule out a role in host lysis and propose an alternative function as a key contributor to RcGTA invasion of a target cell during infection."
https://openalex.org/W2102665007,"Background Mitochondria or mitochondrion-derived organelles are found in all eukaryotes with the exception of secondary or tertiary plastid endosymbionts. In these highly reduced systems, the mitochondrion has been lost in all cases except the diatom endosymbionts found in a small group of dinoflagellates, called ‘dinotoms’, the only cells with two evolutionarily distinct mitochondria. To investigate the persistence of this redundancy and its consequences on the content and structure of the endosymbiont and host mitochondrial genomes, we report the sequences of these genomes from two dinotoms. Methodology/Principal Findings The endosymbiont mitochondrial genomes of Durinskia baltica and Kryptoperidinium foliaceum exhibit nearly identical gene content with other diatoms, and highly conserved gene order (nearly identical to that of the raphid pennate diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus). These two genomes are differentiated from other diatoms' by the fission of nad11 and by an insertion within nad2, in-frame and unspliced from the mRNA. Durinskia baltica is further distinguished from K. foliaceum by two gene fusions and its lack of introns. The host mitochondrial genome in D. baltica encodes cox1 and cob plus several fragments of LSU rRNA gene in a hugely expanded genome that includes numerous pseudogenes, and a trans-spliced cox3 gene, like in other dinoflagellates. Over 100 distinct contigs were identified through 454 sequencing, but intact full-length genes for cox1, cob and the 5′ exon of cox3 were present as a single contig each, suggesting most of the genome is pseudogenes. The host mitochondrial genome of K. foliaceum was difficult to identify, but fragments of all the three protein-coding genes, corresponding transcripts, and transcripts of several LSU rRNA fragments were all recovered. Conclusions/Significance Overall, the endosymbiont and host mitochondrial genomes in the two dinotoms have changed surprisingly little from those of free-living diatoms and dinoflagellates, irrespective of their long coexistence side by side in dinotoms."

The abundance of hemicellulose such as xylan suggests that their hydrolysis and conversion to biofuels can improve the economics of bioenergy production. In an effort to understand xylan hydrolysis at high temperatures, we sequenced the genome of the thermophilic bacterium Caldanaerobius polysaccharolyticus. Analysis of the partial genome sequence revealed a gene cluster that contained both hydrolytic enzymes and also enzymes key to the pentose-phosphate pathway. The hydrolytic enzymes in the gene cluster were demonstrated to convert products from a large endoxylanase (Xyn10A) predicted to anchor to the surface of the bacterium. We further use structural and calorimetric studies to demonstrate that the end products of Xyn10A hydrolysis of xylan are recognized and bound by XBP1, a putative solute-binding protein, likely for transport into the cell. The XBP1 protein showed preference for xylo-oligosaccharides as follows: xylotriose > xylobiose > xylotetraose. To elucidate the structural basis for the oligosaccharide preference, we solved the co-crystal structure of XBP1 complexed with xylotriose to a 1.8-Å resolution. Analysis of the biochemical data in the context of the co-crystal structure reveals the molecular underpinnings of oligosaccharide length specificity."

Specification of motoneuron morphology and axon pathfinding has been studied extensively, implicating the combinatorial action of Lim-homeodomain transcription factors. However, the specification of electrical properties is not understood. Here, we address the key issues of whether the same transcription factors that specify morphology also determine subtype specific electrical properties. We show that Drosophila motoneuron subtypes express different K+ currents and that these are regulated by the conserved Lim-homeodomain transcription factor Islet. Specifically, Islet is sufficient to repress a Shaker-mediated A-type K+ current, most likely due to a direct transcriptional effect. A reduction in Shaker increases the frequency of action potential firing. Our results demonstrate the deterministic role of Islet on the excitability patterns characteristic of motoneuron subtypes.

Embryonic motoneurons show subtype-specific electrical properties Common developmental mechanisms predetermine morphology and electrical properties Islet suppresses A-type K+ channel expression in ventral motoneurons Absence of the A-type K+ channel increases action potential firing frequency Diversity in neuronal signaling is critical for emergence of appropriate behavior. This diversity is reflected in dendrite morphology, axon pathfinding, choice of synaptic partners, transmitter phenotype, and cocktail of ion channels expressed by individual neurons. Many aspects of vertebrate (e.g., chick, zebrafish, and mouse) motoneuron development, including cell specification, axonal pathfinding, and neurotransmitter choice are regulated through expression of LIM-homeodomain transcription factors, including Islet1/2, Lim1/3, and Hb9 (Appel et al., 1995Appel B.

However, the extent to which neuronal electrical properties are similarly predetermined as part of cell-intrinsic developmental mechanisms remains unknown. Neurons grown in culture often express their normal complement of both voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels (O'Dowd et al., 1988O'Dowd D.K. Ribera A.B. Spitzer N.C. Development of voltage-dependent calcium, sodium, and potassium currents in Xenopus spinal neurons.J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 792-805PubMed Google Scholar; Ribera and Spitzer, 1990Ribera A.B. Spitzer N.C.

Development of voltage-dependent and ligand-gated channels in excitable membranes.Prog. Brain Res. 1994; 102: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This suggests a significant degree of cell autonomy in the determination of electrical properties that presumably facilitates initial network formation. Once part of a circuit, however, such neurons become exposed to synaptic activity. As a result, predetermined electrical properties are modified by a variety of well-described mechanisms (Davis and Bezprozvanny, 2001Davis G.W. Bezprozvanny I. Maintaining the stability of neural function: a homeostatic hypothesis.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 847-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar; Spitzer et al., 2002Spitzer N.C. Kingston P.A. Manning T.J. Conklin M.W. Outside and in: development of neuronal excitability.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Such tuning ensures consistency of network output in response to potentially destabilizing activity resulting from Hebbian-based synaptic plasticity (Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004Turrigiano G.G. Nelson S.B. Homeostatic plasticity in the developing nervous system.Nat. Rev. 2004; 5: 97-107Crossref Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). The formation of functional neural circuits would seem, therefore, critically reliant on both intrinsic predetermination and subsequent extrinsic activity-dependent mechanisms to shape neuronal electrical properties. Key to understanding how intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms are integrated will be the identification of factors that regulate predetermination. The fruitfly, Drosophila, has been central to studies that have identified intrinsic determinants of neuronal morphology. Within the Drosophila central nervous system (CNS) the transcription factor Islet is expressed in the RP1, RP3, RP4, and RP5 motoneurons (termed ventral motoneurons, vMNs) that project to ventral muscles (Broihier and Skeath, 2002Broihier H.T.

Tomlinson A. Thomas J.B. A LIM-homeodomain combinatorial code for motor-neuron pathway selection.Nature. 1999; 397: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). By contrast, motoneurons projecting to dorsal muscles (e.g., aCC and RP2, termed dorsal motoneurons, dMNs) express a different homeodomain transcription factor, Even-skipped (Eve) (Broihier and Skeath, 2002Broihier H.T.

Roy S. Prokop A. VijayRaghavan K. Bate M. even-skipped determines the dorsal growth of motor axons in Drosophila.Neuron. 1999; 22: 43-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Misregulation of these transcription factors is sufficient to alter subtype-specific axonal projections (Broihier and Skeath, 2002Broihier H.T. Skeath J.B. Drosophila homeodomain protein dHb9 directs neuronal fate via crossrepressive and cell-nonautonomous mechanisms.Neuron. 2002; 35: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar; Landgraf et al., 1999Landgraf M.

Bate M. even-skipped determines the dorsal growth of motor axons in Drosophila.Neuron. 1999; 22: 43-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, Eve and Islet constitute what might be considered a bimodal switch with each being deterministic for either dorsal or ventral-projecting motor axon trajectories, respectively. Here, we report that the presence of Islet is also deterministic for expression of Shaker (Sh)-mediated outward A-type K+ current. The vMN and dMN subgroups differ in magnitude of outward K+ currents recorded by whole-cell patch clamp. We show that this difference is maintained by endogenous expression of islet in the vMNs. We also show that Islet is sufficient to repress expression of a Sh-mediated K+ current. By contrast, dMNs, which do not express islet, exhibit a robust Sh-mediated K+ current. The deterministic function of Islet is evidenced first by the fact that loss of function results in a transformation of total outward K+ current in the vMNs to mirror that present in dMNs. Second, ectopic expression of islet in dMNs or body wall muscle is sufficient to repress expression of the endogenous Sh-mediated K+ current. Thus, in addition to being sufficient to predetermine aspects of neuronal connectivity, Islet is sufficient to specify electrical properties in those neurons in which it is expressed. A crucial test of the hypothesis that Islet regulates ion channel gene expression is the demonstration that membrane electrical properties of Islet-expressing vMNs differ to those of Eve-expressing dMNs. To determine if this is true, we recorded total K+ currents from both motoneuron subtypes in first-instar larvae (1–4 hr after hatching; see Figure 1A). Motoneurons were initially identified on the basis of their medial dorsal position in the ventral nerve cord; following electrophysiological patch clamp recordings precise subtype was confirmed on the basis of axonal projection that was visualized by dye filling. We did not observe differences within either subgroups; therefore, recordings have been pooled for the vMN or dMN subtypes. Figure 1B shows averaged total outward K+ currents recorded from both the dMNs and vMNs. The outward K+ current is composed of a fast-activating and inactivating component, (IKfast, indicated by the arrow in Figure 1B) and a slower-activating, noninactivating component, (IKslow, indicated by the box in Figure 1B). Analyzing current densities for IKfast and IKslow (Figure 1C) shows that dMNs have significantly larger outward K+ currents compared to vMNs (Figure 1C; at holding potential of +40 mV IKfast: 60.1 ± 4.3 versus 42.6 ± 3.1 pA/pF; IKslow: 49.0 ± 4.4 versus 33.3 ± 2.4 pA/pF, dMNs versus vMNs, respectively, p ≤ 0.01). Thus, vMNs and dMNs differ in their electrical properties. The CNS of a first-instar larva is a mature functional neural network in which synaptic transmission is active. Hence, the differences we observe in K+ currents could be established entirely due to network activity. Alternatively, subtype specificity might be determined prior to neuronal network formation and, as such, could be considered an intrinsic property of the specific motoneurons. To determine this experimentally, we repeated our analysis following complete block of synaptic transmission (i.e., absence of network activity), achieved through expressing tetanus toxin light chain (TeTxLC) throughout the entire CNS. Using the GAL41407 driver, TeTxLC was expressed pan-neuronally starting at the early neuroblast stage. Since TeTxLC-expressing embryos do not hatch, we recorded K+ currents just prior to expected hatching (at late embryonic stage 17). At this stage motoneurons have become fully functional components of the motor network (Baines and Bate, 1998Baines R.A. Bate M. Electrophysiological development of central neurons in the Drosophila embryo.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4673-4683PubMed Google Scholar). We found that IK was not significantly perturbed, in either dMNs or vMNs, by blockade of synaptic release. Moreover the difference in K+ currents between the dMNs and vMNs was maintained for both IKfast and IKslow. That differences in IK levels between dMNs and vMNs are established and maintained in the absence of synaptic release strongly suggests that they arise from intrinsic developmental mechanisms independent of evoked synaptic transmission. Drosophila larval motoneurons that project axons to ventral muscles express Islet, while those that innervate dorsal muscles express Eve. Loss of islet is sufficient to direct ventral-projecting axons dorsally and loss of eve to direct dorsal-projecting axons ventrally (Landgraf et al., 1999Landgraf M. Roy S. Prokop A. VijayRaghavan K. Bate M. even-skipped determines the dorsal growth of motor axons in Drosophila.Neuron. 1999; 22: 43-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar; Thor and Thomas, 1997Thor S. Thomas J.B. The Drosophila islet gene governs axon pathfinding and neurotransmitter identity.Neuron. 1997; 18: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). These two distinct motoneuron subtypes provide, therefore, a tractable system to test whether the differences we observe in K+ conductance is also intrinsically determined. In order to test whether Islet is able to influence K+ currents we recorded from vMNs in an islet null (−/−) mutant. This analysis indicated that Islet is sufficient to regulate K+ conductance in these motoneurons. Thus, peak current density for IKfast was significantly increased in homozygous islet−/− mutants (Figure 2A; WT 42.6 ± 3.1 versus islet 62.6 ± 5.8 pA/pF p ≤ 0.05). By contrast, IKfast in heterozygous siblings (+/−) did not differ from WT (data not shown). To better measure IKslow we inactivated IKfast by applying a −20mV prepulse (100 ms; see Baines and Bate, 1998Baines R.A. Bate M. Electrophysiological development of central neurons in the Drosophila embryo.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4673-4683PubMed Google Scholar). Figure 2B shows that loss of islet had no effect on IKslow (WT 24.2 ± 2.3 versus islet 28 ± 3.9 pA/pF p = 0.45). We also compared voltage-gated inward currents (i.e., INa and ICa) in vMNs of heterozygous islet+/− and homozygous islet−/− mutants. Loss of islet did not affect the peak current densities of either current (INa: −23.4 ± 2.7 versus −19.7 ± 2.4 and ICa: −19.69 ± 1.68 versus −21.03 ± 2.43, islet+/− versus islet−/−). Thus, loss of islet results in a selective increase in only IKfast in the vMNs. To test for autonomy of effect, we also recorded from dMNs in the islet−/− mutant. Dorsal MNs do not express islet, and IKfast currents of WT and mutant larvae were statistically indistinguishable (Figure 2C; WT 60.1 ± 4.3 pA/pF versus islet−/− 68.2 ± 5.9 pA/pF p = 0.28). We conclude that loss of islet only affects IKfast in vMNs in which it is normally expressed, but not in dMNs that lack expression of this transcription factor. We further noted that loss of islet from the vMNs resulted in a transformation of IKfast to recapitulate the magnitude of this same current recorded in dMNs. When averaged responses of islet−/− vMNs and WT dMNs were superimposed, only small kinetic differences remain (Figure 2D). Such an observation is entirely consistent with, and indeed predictive of, the magnitude of IKfast being regulated by endogenous expression of Islet. Fast K+ currents in Drosophila neurons are encoded by one or more of at least three different genes: two voltage-gated fast-activating and inactivating channels (A-currents) termed Shal and Shaker (Sh) and a Ca2+-activated BK channel termed slowpoke (Baker and Salkoff, 1990Baker K. Salkoff L. The Drosophila Shaker gene codes for a distinctive K+ current in a subset of neurons.Neuron. 1990; 4: 129-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar; Elkins et al., 1986Elkins T.

Properties of potassium currents and their role in membrane excitability in Drosophila larval muscle fibers.J. Exp. Biol. 1990; 152: 59-76PubMed Google Scholar). To determine which K+ current is increased in vMNs following loss of islet, we used specific blockers of these individual currents. We first explored whether IKslowpoke is repressed by Islet. To do so we added Cd2+ to the bath solution. Cd2+ blocks Ca2+ entry and, as a consequence, prevents activation of Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Addition of Cd2+ did not diminish the increase in IKfast observed in the vMNs in islet−/− mutants (data not shown). We conclude from this that Islet does not influence IKslowpoke. By contrast, the presence of α-Dentrotoxin (DTx), a potent and specific blocker for Sh-mediated K+ currents (Ryglewski and Duch, 2009Ryglewski S. Duch C. Shaker and Shal mediate transient calcium-independent potassium current in a Drosophila flight motoneuron.J. Neurophysiol. 2009; 102: 3673-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar; Wu et al., 1989Wu C.F. Tsai M.C. Chen M.L. Zhong Y. Singh S. Lee C.Y. Actions of dendrotoxin on K+ channels and neuromuscular transmission in Drosophila melanogaster, and its effects in synergy with K+ channel-specific drugs and mutations.J. Exp. Biol. 1989; 147: 21-41PubMed Google Scholar), completely abolishes the increase of IKfast seen in the vMNs in islet−/− (Figure 3A; control 58.5 ± 6.9 versus DTx 43.1 ± 2.7 pA/pF p ≤ 0.05). Indeed, IKfast values obtained in the presence of DTx closely mirrored untreated WT vMNs (43.1 ± 2.7 versus 42.6 ± 3.1 p = 0.9). That DTx negates the islet−/− phenotype is consistent with Islet inhibiting a Sh-mediated K+ current in WT vMNs. To verify this prediction, we recorded IKfast in a Sh;islet double mutant. Similarly, under these conditions, peak current density of IKfast in the double mutant was indistinguishable from WT vMNs (Figure 3A; p = 0.24). Our data are consistent with Islet acting to repress expression of Sh in vMNs. Moreover, removal of this repression results in expression of Sh-mediated K+ channels that confer “dorsal-like” electrical properties. This model posits, therefore, that dMNs normally express a Sh-mediated K+ current. To test this, we compared IKfast in dMNs between WT and in the presence of either DTx or in a Sh null mutant (Sh[14]). We performed these recordings in the presence of external Cd2+ to block Ca2+-activated fast K+ currents. Both acute block of Sh activity (DTx) and loss of function of Sh expression significantly reduced IKfast (Figure 3B; WT 40.5 ± 1.9 versus WT + DTx 29.3 ± 2.7 versus Sh[14] 26.1 ± 1.7 pA/pF; p ≤ 0.01 and p ≤ 0.01, respectively). Moreover, the IKfast recorded in dMNs under both conditions (WT + DTx 29.3 ± 2.7 and Sh[14] 26.1 ± 1.7 pA/pF) was indistinguishable from that of vMNs in WT (26.1 ± 2.3 pA/pF, DTx p = 0.38, Sh p = 1), which is in full agreement with our model. To further support the notion that the difference in IKfast that exists between dMNs and vMNs is due, at least in part, to expression of Sh in dMNs, we recorded IKfast in vMNs under the same conditions. As expected, neither the presence of DTx, nor loss of Sh, had any marked effect on IKfast in vMNs (p = 0.51 and 0.23, respectively; Figure 3B). To further verify the differential expression of Sh in dMNs versus vMNs we assessed transcription of Sh in these two cell types by in situ hybridization. We designed probes that specifically recognize the Sh pre-mRNA. These intron probes label the unspliced Sh transcript at the site of transcription within the nucleus, but not the fully mature message in the cytoplasm. We detected Sh transcription in dMNs, labeled with Eve antibody (Figure 3C, black arrowheads), but not in vMNs, labeled by expression of GFP (Lim3 > nlsGFP; Figure 3D, white arrowheads). Taken together, both electrophysiology and in situ hybridization are consistent with dMNs expressing Sh while the vMNs do not. Next, we tested whether Islet is sufficient to repress Sh-mediated K+ currents in cells where Sh, but not islet, is normally expressed. We used two different preparations for these experiments. First, we ectopically expressed islet in dMNs. Driving a UAS-islet transgene with GAL4RN2-0 significantly reduced IKfast (34.4 ± 2.6 versus 41.2 ± 1.9 pA/pF, experimental versus controls which consisted of WT and heterozygous GAL4 driver line, p ≤ 0.05; Figure 4A). These recordings were carried out in the presence of external Cd2+ to eliminate Ca2+-dependent K+ currents. The observed reduction in IKfast in dMNs could, however, be due to a reduction in either Sh- or Shal-mediated K+ currents. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we tested for DTx sensitivity, which is observed in WT dMNs and is an indicator for the presence of Sh currents. DTx sensitivity was lost when islet was ectopically expressed in dMNs (Figure 4A). In addition, when we expressed ectopic islet in dMNs in a Sh−/− background, there was no further reduction in IKfast compared to ectopic islet expression in a WT background (Figure 4A). We conclude from this that ectopic expression of islet in dMNs is sufficient to downregulate Sh-mediated IKfast. The second preparation we used takes advantage of the fact that IKfast in body wall muscle is solely due to Sh and Slowpoke (the latter of which can be easily blocked [Singh and Wu, 1990Singh S. Wu C.F. Properties of potassium currents and their role in membrane excitability in Drosophila larval muscle fibers.J. Exp. Biol. 1990; 152: 59-76PubMed Google Scholar]). We recorded from muscle 6 in abdominal segments 3 and 4 in first-instar larvae. To remove the IKslowpoke component and hence isolate the Sh-mediated IKfast, recordings were done in low calcium (0.1 mM) external saline. Figure 4B depicts the averaged responses from voltage-clamp recordings in control muscle (heterozygous GAL424B driver, upper trace) and muscle expressing islet (lower trace). Peak current densities of IKfast (entirely due to Sh-mediated K+ current) and the slow noninactivating currents recorded at +40 mV are shown in Figure 4C. Ectopic expression of islet in muscle is sufficient to produce a significant reduction in IKfast (control 26.6 ± 2.4 versus 24B > islet 15.8 ± 1.0 pA/pF, p ≤ 0.01) while no effect was seen on the slow current. Thus, expression of islet in dMNs is sufficient to reduce a DTx-sensitive component of IKfast. Similar expression in muscle clearly demonstrates that Islet is sufficient to downregulate a Sh-mediated fast K+ current. Our electrophysiology indicates that Islet is able to repress Sh-mediated K+ current. To identify putative targets of Islet we used DamID, a well-accepted technique for demonstrating direct binding to chromatin or DNA in vivo (Choksi et al., 2006Choksi S.P. Southall T.D. Bossing T.

Our analysis identifies 1,769 genes (exhibiting one or more peaks of Islet binding within 5 kb of the transcriptional unit) as direct targets of Islet (FDR < 0.1%). Consistent with our model of Islet regulating a Sh-mediated K+ current, we find three significant binding sites within introns of the Sh locus (arrows 1 to 3 in Figure 5). Intragenic binding of transcription factors is common in both vertebrates (Robertson et al., 2007Robertson G. Hirst M. Bainbridge M. Bilenky M. Zhao Y. Zeng T. Euskirchen G. Bernier B. Varhol R. Delaney A. et al.Genome-wide profiles of STAT1 DNA association using chromatin immunoprecipitation and massively parallel sequencing.Nat.

Neural stem cell transcriptional networks highlight genes essential for nervous system development.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3799-3807Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A fourth significant peak is found upstream of Sh (arrow 4 in Figure 5). Binding of Islet at this site could regulate the expression of either Sh and/or CG15373 an adjacent, divergently transcribed, gene. By contrast, Shal and slowpoke, which also encode fast neuronal K+ currents, were not identified as putative targets (Figure 5). Thus, these data show that Islet binds to the Sh locus and is likely to regulate transcription of the Sh gene directly. To confirm that Islet binds Sh and regulates its transcription, we used qRT-PCR to quantify levels of Sh transcripts. We compared Sh transcript levels in larval CNS between control, islet−/− and panneuronal islet expression (1407 > islet). In comparison to control, the absence of islet−/− resulted in a 27% increase in Sh (1.27 ± 0.01, n = 2, p < 0.05). By contrast, panneuronal expression of transgenic islet resulted in a 45% decrease in Sh transcript (0.45 ± 0.06, n = 2, p < 0.05). We also measured Sh transcript level in body wall muscle following ectopic expression of islet (24B > islet). Similar to the CNS, Sh transcripts were reduced by 31% relative to control (0.31 ± 0.01, n = 2, p < 0.05). Taken together with the results obtained by DamID, this strongly suggests that Islet binds to, and represses transcription of, the Sh gene. Voltage-dependent K+ currents, such as those mediated by Sh, contribute to setting membrane excitability (and thus the ability to fire action potentials) (Goldberg et al., 2008Goldberg E.M.

https://openalex.org/W2108631599,"The MYST family of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes, such as the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Lysine autoacetylation of the MYST HATs has recently received considerable attention. Nonetheless, the mechanism and function of the autoacetylation process are not well defined. To better understand the biochemical mechanism of MYST autoacetylation and the impact of autoacetylation on the cognate histone acetylation, we carried out detailed analyses of males-absent-on-the-first (MOF), a key member of the MYST family. A number of mutant MOF proteins were produced with point mutations at several key residues near the active site of the enzyme. Autoradiography and immunoblotting data showed that mutation of these residues affects the autoacetylation activity and HAT activity of MOF by various degrees demonstrating that MOF activity is highly sensitive to the chemical changes in those residues. We produced MOF protein in the deacetylated form by using a nonspecific lysine deacetylase. Interestingly, both the autoacetylation activity and the histone acetylation activity of the deacetylated MOF were found to be very close to that of wild-type MOF, suggesting that autoacetylation of MOF only marginally modulates the enzymatic activity. Also, we found that the autoacetylation rates of MOF and deacetylated MOF were much slower than the cognate substrate acetylation. Thus, autoacetylation does not seem to contribute to the intrinsic enzymatic activity in a significant manner. These data provide new insights into the mechanism and function of MYST HAT autoacetylation."

https://openalex.org/W1995002220,"Inhibitor of Growth (ING) proteins are epigenetic ""readers"" that recognize trimethylated lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4Me3) and target histone acetyl transferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes to chromatin.Here we asked whether dysregulating two epigenetic pathways with chemical inhibitors showed synergistic effects on breast cancer cell line killing. We also tested whether ING1 could synergize better with chemotherapeutics that target the same epigenetic mechanism such as the HDAC inhibitor LBH589 (Panobinostat) or a different epigenetic mechanism such as 5-azacytidine (5azaC), which inhibits DNA methyl transferases. Simultaneous treatment of breast cancer cell lines with LBH589 and 5azaC did not show significant synergy in killing cells. However, combination treatment of ING1 with either LBH589 or 5azaC did show synergy. The combination of ING1b with 5azaC, which targets two distinct epigenetic mechanisms, was more effective at lower doses and enhanced apoptosis as determined by Annexin V staining and cleavage of caspase 3 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). ING1b plus 5azaC also acted synergistically to increase γH2AX staining indicating significant levels of DNA damage were induced. Adenoviral delivery of ING1b with 5azaC also inhibited cancer cell growth in a murine xenograft model and led to tumor regression when viral concentration was optimized in vivo.These data show that targeting distinct epigenetic pathways can be more effective in blocking cancer cell line growth than targeting the same pathway with multiple agents, and that using viral delivery of epigenetic regulators can be more effective in synergizing with a chemical agent than using two chemotherapeutic agents. This study also indicates that the ING1 epigenetic regulator may have additional activities in the cell when expressed at high levels."
https://openalex.org/W2018642631,"Regulation of gene expression by microRNAs (miRNAs) is now considered as an essential mechanism for cell development and homeostasis. Indeed, numerous studies have reported that modulating their expression, maturation, or activity can affect cell survival, identity or activation. In particular, miRNAs are key players in the tight regulation of signaling cascades, and as such, they appear as perfectly suited immunomodulators. Several immune-related processes, including inflammation, have recently been demonstrated to require specific miRNAs. In addition, the discovery of herpesvirus-encoded miRNAs has reinforced this assumption. To decipher the potential roles of miRNAs in innate antiviral immune response, we developed an in vivo model based on the inoculation of mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) in mice. Furthermore, we exploited a mouse line carrying a hypomorphic mutation in the Dicer gene to visualize the impact of impaired miRNA biogenesis upon the anti-MCMV response. Our data indicate that miRNAs are important actors in mounting an efficient response against herpesviruses. We suggest that a rapid and transient interferon response following viral infection requires miRNA-dependent repressor release. In addition, our in vivo efforts identified several miRNA targets, thus providing a conceptual framework for future analyzes on the regulation of specific actors involved in the Type I interferon pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1995056292,"Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) is an aggressive tumor often diagnosed at an advanced stage, when there is little or no prospect of cure. Despite advances in surgical and chemotherapeutic strategies, only marginal improvements in patient outcome have been obtained. Hence, unraveling the biological mechanisms underpinning EOC progression is critical for improving patients' survival. Recently, we reported that CD157 (an ectoenzyme regulating leukocyte diapedesis) is expressed in EOC and that high expression of the molecule is negatively correlated with the disease outcome in patients. Here, we demonstrate that forced overexpression of CD157 in OVCAR-3, TOV-21G, A2780 and OV-90 ovarian cancer cell lines promotes morphological and phenotypic changes characterized by disruption of intercellular junctions, downregulation of epithelial markers and upregulation of mesenchymal ones. These changes in cell shape and phenotype bring to reduced sensitivity to anoikis, increased anchorage-independent growth, cell motility and mesothelial invasion. Conversely, knockdown of CD157 in OV-90 and OC314 cells reverts the mesenchymal phenotype and reduces the cells' migratory potential. Transcriptome profiling analysis highlighted 378 significantly differentially expressed genes, representing the signature of CD157-overexpressing OVCAR-3 and OV-90 cells. The modulation of selected genes translates into alteration of protein expression that give cells a highly malignant phenotype. The overall picture deduced from the analysis of the modulated transcripts is that high expression of CD157 strengthens a number of biological processes favoring tumor progression (including development and cell motility), and weakens several biological processes hindering tumor progression (such as apoptosis, cell death and response to stress). Together, these findings implicate CD157 in the progression of EOC to metastatic disease and suggest that CD157 may represent a valuable therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W1987276345,"Catalase activity of the dual-function heme enzyme catalase-peroxidase (KatG) depends on several structural elements, including a unique adduct formed from covalently linked side chains of three conserved amino acids (Met-255, Tyr-229, and Trp-107, Mycobacterium tuberculosis KatG numbering) (MYW). Mutagenesis, electron paramagnetic resonance, and optical stopped-flow experiments, along with calculations using density functional theory (DFT) methods revealed the basis of the requirement for a radical on the MYW-adduct, for oxyferrous heme, and for conserved residues Arg-418 and Asp-137 in the rapid catalase reaction. The participation of an oxyferrous heme intermediate (dioxyheme) throughout the pH range of catalase activity is suggested from our finding that carbon monoxide inhibits the activity at both acidic and alkaline pH. In the presence of H(2)O(2), the MYW-adduct radical is formed normally in KatG[D137S] but this mutant is defective in forming dioxyheme and lacks catalase activity. KatG[R418L] is also catalase deficient but exhibits normal formation of the adduct radical and dioxyheme. Both mutants exhibit a coincidence between MYW-adduct radical persistence and H(2)O(2) consumption as a function of time, and enhanced subunit oligomerization during turnover, suggesting that the two mutations disrupting catalase turnover allow increased migration of the MYW-adduct radical to protein surface residues. DFT calculations showed that an interaction between the side chain of residue Arg-418 and Tyr-229 in the MYW-adduct radical favors reaction of the radical with the adjacent dioxyheme intermediate present throughout turnover in WT KatG. Release of molecular oxygen and regeneration of resting enzyme are thereby catalyzed in the last step of a proposed catalase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2011445921,"Wide availability of highly palatable foods is often blamed for the rising incidence of obesity. As palatability is largely determined by the sensory properties of food, this study investigated how sensitivity to these properties affects how much we eat. Forty females were classified as either high or low in sensory sensitivity based on their scores on a self-report measure of sensory processing (the Adult Sensory Profile), and their intake of chocolate during the experiment was measured. Food intake was significantly higher for high-sensitivity compared to low-sensitivity individuals. Furthermore, individual scores of sensory sensitivity were positively correlated with self-reported emotional eating. These data could indicate that individuals who are more sensitive to the sensory properties of food have a heightened perception of palatability, which, in turn, leads to a greater food intake."
https://openalex.org/W2084292595,"The social environment of animals strongly influences the mating preferences of both the choosing and the observing individuals. Notably, there is recent evidence that polygamous males decrease their selectivity when being observed by competitors in order to direct their rivals' attention away from their true interest and, consequently, reduce sperm competition risk. Yet, other mechanisms, whose importance remains unexplored, could induce similar effects. In monogamous species with mutual choice, particularly, if males adjust their selectivity according to the risk of being rejected by their preferred mate, they should as well become less selective when potential rivals are present. Here, we investigated whether the presence of bystanders modifies male mating preferences when the risk of sperm competition is low, by carrying out mate-choice experiments with male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) whose preferences for two females were measured twice: with and without an audience. We found that the presence of potential rivals had no effect on the males' choosiness. However, with an audience, they spent more time with the female that was considered as the less attractive one in the control condition. These findings support the hypothesis that monogamous males alter their mate choice decisions in the presence of a male audience to reduce the risk of remaining unpaired. Thus, our results indicate that several explanations can account for the changes in male preferences due to the presence of competitors and highlight the importance of assessing the relative role of each mechanism potentially involved, to be able to make conclusions about the effect of an audience on signal evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2020948969,"To examine ethnic differences in cardiometabolic risk profile in early age, and explore whether such differences can be explained by differences in body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference (WC).Anthropometric measurements, blood pressure and (in a subsample) fasting blood were collected during a health check of 2,509 children aged 5-6 years. Four ethnic groups were distinguished: Dutch (n=2,008; blood n=1,300), African descent (n=199; blood n=105), Turkish (n=108; blood n=57) and Moroccan (n=194; blood n=94). Ethnic differences in diastolic and systolic blood pressure (DBP/SBP), fasting glucose, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglyceride levels were determined and the explanatory role of BMI and WC was examined with regression analysis.After adjustment for confounders, African descent children showed higher DBP (β2.22 mmHg; 95%CI:1.09-3.36) and HDL levels (β:0.09 mmol/l; 95%CI:0.03-0.16) compared to Dutch children (reference group). Turkish children showed higher SBP (β:1.89 mmHg; 95%CI:0.25-3.54), DBP (β:2.62 mmHg; 95%CI:1.11-4.13), glucose (β:0.12 mmol/L; 95%CI:0.00-0.25) and triglyceride levels (β:0.13 mmol/L; 95%CI:0.02-0.25). Higher BMI values were found in all non-Dutch groups (differences ranged from 0.53-1.03 kg/m(2)) and higher WC in Turkish (β:1.68 cm; 95%CI:0.99-2.38) and Moroccan (β:1.65 cm; 95%CI:1.11-2.19) children. BMI and WC partly explained the higher SBP/DBP and triglyceride levels in Turkish children.Ethnic differences in cardiometabolic profile exist early in life and are partly explained by differences in BMI and WC. African children showed favourable HDL levels and Turkish children the most unfavourable overall profile, whereas their Moroccan peers have less increased cardiometabolic risk in spite of their high BMI and WC."
https://openalex.org/W2091293340,"In species where females mate promiscuously, the reproductive success of males depends both on their ability to acquire mates (pre-copulatory sexual selection) and ability of their ejaculates to outcompete those of other males (post-copulatory sexual selection). Sperm competition theory predicts a negative relationship between investment in body traits favouring mate acquisition (secondary sexual characters, SSCs) and investment in ejaculate size or quality, due to the inherent costs of sperm production. In contrast, the phenotype-linked fertility hypothesis posits that male fertilizing efficiency is reliably reflected by the phenotypic expression of male SSCs, allowing females to obtain direct benefits by selecting more ornamented males as copulation partners. In this study, we investigated the relationships between male SSCs and size and quality (viability and longevity) of ejaculates allocated to females in mating trials of the freshwater crayfish Austropotamobius italicus. We showed that the relative size of male weapons, the chelae, was negatively related to ejaculate size, and that chelae asymmetry, resulting from regeneration of lost chelipeds, negatively covaried with sperm longevity. Moreover, males allocated more viable sperm to mates from their own rather than different stream of origin. Our findings thus suggest that, according to sperm competition theory, pre-copulatory sexual selection for large weapons used in male fighting may counteract post-copulatory sperm competition in this crayfish species, and that investment in cheliped regeneration may impair ejaculate quality."
https://openalex.org/W2050987923,"In Giardia, lysosome-like peripheral vacuoles (PVs) need to specifically coordinate their endosomal and lysosomal functions to be able to successfully perform endocytosis, protein degradation and protein delivery, but how cargo, ligands and molecular components generate specific routes to the PVs remains poorly understood. Recently, we found that delivering membrane Cathepsin C and the soluble acid phosphatase (AcPh) to the PVs is adaptin (AP1)-dependent. However, the receptor that links AcPh and AP1 was never described. We have studied protein-binding to AcPh by using H6-tagged AcPh, and found that a membrane protein interacted with AcPh. This protein, named GlVps (for Giardia lamblia Vacuolar protein sorting), mainly localized to the ER-nuclear envelope and in some PVs, probably functioning as the sorting receptor for AcPh. The tyrosine-binding motif found in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail domain of GlVps was essential for its exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and transport to the vacuoles, with this motif being necessary for the interaction with the medium subunit of AP1. Thus, the mechanism by which soluble proteins, such as AcPh, reach the peripheral vacuoles in Giardia appears to be very similar to the mechanism of lysosomal protein-sorting in more evolved eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2056548554,"In adipocytes, vesicles containing glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) redistribute from intracellular stores to the cell periphery in response to insulin stimulation. Vesicles then fuse with the plasma membrane, facilitating glucose transport into the cell. To gain insight into the details of microtubule involvement, we examined the spatial organization and dynamics of microtubules in relation to GLUT4 vesicle trafficking in living 3T3-L1 adipocytes using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Insulin stimulated an increase in microtubule density and curvature within the TIRF-illuminated region of the cell. The high degree of curvature and abrupt displacements of microtubules indicate that substantial forces act on microtubules. The time course of the microtubule density increase precedes that of the increase in intensity of fluorescently-tagged GLUT4 in this same region of the cell. In addition, portions of the microtubules are highly curved and are pulled closer to the cell cortex, as confirmed by Parallax microscopy. Microtubule disruption delayed and modestly reduced GLUT4 accumulation at the plasma membrane. Quantitative analysis revealed that fusions of GLUT4-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane, detected using insulin-regulated aminopeptidase with a pH-sensitive GFP tag (pHluorin), preferentially occur near microtubules. Interestingly, long-distance vesicle movement along microtubules visible at the cell surface prior to fusion does not appear to account for this proximity. We conclude that microtubules may be important in providing spatial information for GLUT4 vesicle fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2086897034,"Altered fibrin clot architecture is increasingly associated with cardiovascular diseases; yet, little is known about how fibrin networks are affected by small molecules that alter fibrinogen structure. Based on previous evidence that S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) alters fibrinogen secondary structure and fibrin polymerization kinetics, we hypothesized that GSNO would alter fibrin microstructure.Accordingly, we treated human platelet-poor plasma with GSNO (0.01-3.75 mM) and imaged thrombin induced fibrin networks using multiphoton microscopy. Using custom designed computer software, we analyzed fibrin microstructure for changes in structural features including fiber density, diameter, branch point density, crossing fibers and void area. We report for the first time that GSNO dose-dependently decreased fibrin density until complete network inhibition was achieved. At low dose GSNO, fiber diameter increased 25%, maintaining clot void volume at approximately 70%. However, at high dose GSNO, abnormal irregularly shaped fibrin clusters with high fluorescence intensity cores were detected and clot void volume increased dramatically. Notwithstanding fibrin clusters, the clot remained stable, as fiber branching was insensitive to GSNO and there was no evidence of fiber motion within the network. Moreover, at the highest GSNO dose tested, we observed for the first time, that GSNO induced formation of fibrin agglomerates.Taken together, low dose GSNO modulated fibrin microstructure generating coarse fibrin networks with thicker fibers; however, higher doses of GSNO induced abnormal fibrin structures and fibrin agglomerates. Since GSNO maintained clot void volume, while altering fiber diameter it suggests that GSNO may modulate the remodeling or inhibition of fibrin networks over an optimal concentration range."
https://openalex.org/W2084237476,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) play important neurophysiological roles and are of considerable medical relevance. They have been studied extensively, greatly facilitated by the gastropod acetylcholine-binding proteins (AChBP) which represent soluble structural and functional homologues of the ligand-binding domain of nAChR. All these proteins are ring-like pentamers. Here we report that AChBP exists in the hemolymph of the planorbid snail Biomphalaria glabrata (vector of the schistosomiasis parasite) as a regular pentagonal dodecahedron, 22 nm in diameter (12 pentamers, 60 active sites). We sequenced and recombinantly expressed two ∼25 kDa polypeptides (BgAChBP1 and BgAChBP2) with a specific active site, N-glycan site and disulfide bridge variation. We also provide the exon/intron structures. Recombinant BgAChBP1 formed pentamers and dodecahedra, recombinant BgAChBP2 formed pentamers and probably disulfide-bridged di-pentamers, but not dodecahedra. Three-dimensional electron cryo-microscopy (3D-EM) yielded a 3D reconstruction of the dodecahedron with a resolution of 6 Å. Homology models of the pentamers docked to the 6 Å structure revealed opportunities for chemical bonding at the inter-pentamer interfaces. Definition of the ligand-binding pocket and the gating C-loop in the 6 Å structure suggests that 3D-EM might lead to the identification of functional states in the BgAChBP dodecahedron."
https://openalex.org/W1969541536,"Our goal was to investigate how the propagation of alternating signals (i.e. AC), like action potentials, into the dendrites influenced nonlinear firing behaviour of motor neurons using a systematically reduced neuron model. A recently developed reduced modeling approach using only steady-current (i.e. DC) signaling was analytically expanded to retain features of the frequency-response analysis carried out in multicompartment anatomically reconstructed models. Bifurcation analysis of the extended model showed that the typically overlooked parameter of AC amplitude attenuation was positively correlated with the current threshold for the activation of a plateau potential in the dendrite. Within the multiparameter space map of the reduced model the region demonstrating ""fully-bistable"" firing was bounded by directional DC attenuation values that were negatively correlated to AC attenuation. Based on these results we conclude that analytically derived reduced models of dendritic trees should be fit on DC and AC signaling, as both are important biophysical parameters governing the nonlinear firing behaviour of motor neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2019282805,"Vegetation light use efficiency (LUE) is a key parameter of Production Efficiency Models (PEMs) for simulating gross primary production (GPP) of vegetation, from regional to global scales. Previous studies suggest that grasslands have the largest inter-site variation of LUE and controlling factors of grassland LUE differ from those of other biomes, since grasslands are usually water-limited ecosystems. Combining eddy covariance flux data with the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the plant canopy from MODIS, we report LUE on a typical steppe and a desert steppe in Inner Mongolia, northern China. Results show that both annual average LUE and maximum LUE were higher on the desert steppe (0.51 and 1.13 g C MJ−1) than on the typical steppe (0.34 and 0.88 g C MJ−1), despite the higher GPP of the latter. Water availability was the primary limiting factor of LUE at both sites. Evaporative fraction (EF) or the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to potential evapotranspiration (AET/PET) can explain 50–70% of seasonal LUE variations at both sites. However, the slope of linear regression between LUE and EF (or AET/PET) differed significantly between the two sites. LUE increased with the diffuse radiation ratio on the typical steppe; however, such a trend was not found for the desert steppe. Our results suggest that a biome-dependent LUEmax is inappropriate, because of the large inter-site difference of LUEmax within the biome. EF could be a promising down-regulator on grassland LUE for PEMs, but there may be a site-specific relationship between LUE and EF."

However, the underlying mechanisms of beta adrenergic overstimulation in cerebrovascular dysfunctions are not well known. We investigated the possible cerebrovascular dysfunction response to isoproterenol induced beta-adrenergic overstimulation (ISO) in rabbit cerebral arteries (CAs).ISO was induced in six weeks aged male New Zealand white rabbit (0.8-1.0 kg) by 7-days isoproterenol injection (300 μg/kg/day). We investigated the alteration of protein expression in ISO treated CAs using 2DE proteomics and western blot analysis. Systemic properties of 2DE proteomics result were analyzed using bioinformatics software. ROS generation and following DNA damage were assessed to evaluate deteriorative effect of ISO on CAs. Intracellular Ca(2+) level change and vascular contractile response to vasoactive drug, angiotensin II (Ang II), were assessed to evaluate functional alteration of ISO treated CAs. Ang II-induced ROS generation was assessed to evaluated involvement of ROS generation in CA contractility.Proteomic analysis revealed remarkably decreased expression of cytoskeleton organizing proteins (e.g. actin related protein 1A and 2, α-actin, capping protein Z beta, and vimentin) and anti-oxidative stress proteins (e.g. heat shock protein 9A and stress-induced-phosphoprotein 1) in ISO-CAs. As a cause of dysregulation of actin-cytoskeleton organization, we found decreased level of RhoA and ROCK1, which are major regulators of actin-cytoskeleton organization. As functional consequences of proteomic alteration, we found the decreased transient Ca(2+) efflux and constriction response to angiotensin II and high K(+) in ISO-CAs. ISO also increased basal ROS generation and induced oxidative damage in CA; however, it decreased the Ang II-induced ROS generation rate. These results indicate that ISO disrupted actin cytoskeleton proteome network through down-regulation of RhoA/ROCK1 proteins and increased oxidative damage, which consequently led to contractile dysfunction in CA."
https://openalex.org/W2038869676,"For research findings to be generalized, a sample must be representative of the actual population of interest. Lower limb amputation is most frequently performed in older patients with vascular disease, a population that is often under-represented in research. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of selection bias by comparing characteristics from a sample included in a prospective study of phantom pain with the actual population who underwent amputation. Only 27% of all potential patients were referred during the first year of the prospective study. The referred patients were 8 years younger (p<0.001) and less likely to have had amputation because of a vascular condition, diabetes or infection (p=0.003) than those not referred. There was also a significant difference in one year survival between the groups; 67% of referred patients survived compared with just 40% of non-referred patients (p=0.004). The biased population in the phantom pain study may have resulted in an underestimation of phantom pain in the original study and subsequent protective factors should be considered within the context of the younger population reported. Selection bias is common in amputation research, and research methods to minimize its impact must be given greater attention."
