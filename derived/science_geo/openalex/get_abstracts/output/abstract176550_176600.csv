https://openalex.org/W2071801517,"Cyclosporin A (CsA) inhibits opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), a critical event in some forms of necrotic and apoptotic cell death, by binding to cyclophilin D (CyP-D) and inhibiting its peptidyl-prolylcis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity. Sanglifehrin A (SfA), like CsA, exerts its immunosuppressive action by binding to cyclophilin A but at a different site from CsA, and unlike the latter, SfA does not inhibit calcineurin activity. Here we demonstrate that SfA inhibits the PPIase activity of CyP-D (K 0.5 2 nm) and acts as a potent inhibitor of MPTP opening under both energized and de-energized conditions. However, unlike CsA, the dose-response curve for inhibition by SfA is sigmoidal rather than hyperbolic, suggesting a multimeric structure for the MPTP with cooperativity between subunits. Furthermore, SfA does not prevent CyP-D binding to submitochondrial particles or detergent-solubilized adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), implying that CyP-D binding to the ANT does not require PPIase activity but pore opening does. Once bound to the MPTP, SfA is not readily dissociated, and inhibition of pore opening is maintained following extensive washing. To investigate the potential of SfA as an inhibitor of cell death in vivo, we used the Langendorff perfused rat heart. SfA caused a time-dependent inhibition of the MPTP that was maintained on mitochondrial isolation to a greater extent than was CsA inhibition. We demonstrate that SfA, like CsA, improves the recovery of left ventricular developed pressure during reperfusion after 30 min of global ischemia and greatly reduces lactate dehydrogenase release, implying inhibition of necrotic damage. Because SfA does not inhibit calcineurin activity, our data suggest that it may be more desirable than CsA for protecting tissues recovering from ischemic episodes and for studying the role of the MPTP in cell death.

Trans. 2000; 28: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). To date, the most specific inhibitor of the MPTP is cyclosporin A (CsA) (5Crompton M. Ellinger H. Costi A. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 357-360PubMed Google Scholar), which acts by inhibiting the peptidyl-prolylcis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity of CyP-D (6Halestrap A.P. Davidson A.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 7Griffiths E.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Indeed, CsA can act as a potent inhibitor of both apoptotic and necrotic cell death under some circumstances (1Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar, 2Halestrap A.P. Doran E. Gillespie J.P. O'Toole A. Biochem. Soc.

Nevertheless, inhibition of cell death by CsA does not provide definitive evidence for a critical role of the MPTP in the process, because CsA exerts other effects on cell function. In particular, the immunosuppressant action of the drug is mediated through inhibition of calcineurin, a calcium-activated protein phosphatase involved in the regulation of gene expression and other intracellular functions (8Schreiber S.L.

However, there are CsA analogues such as N-Me-Ala-6-cyclosporin A andN-Me-Val-4-cyclosporin A that do not inhibit calcineurin activity and yet still inhibit the PPIase activity of CyP-D, antagonize the opening of the MPTP and protect cells from apoptotic and necrotic cell death (11Griffiths E.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 12Nicolli A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Wenger R.M. Bernardi P. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3194-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this paper we investigate another immunosuppressant drug, sanglifehrin A, that is unrelated to CsA but like CsA binds tightly to cyclophilin A (CyP-A) with aK 0.5 of 4–7 nm, inhibiting its PPIase activity (K 0.5 13 nm). However, unlike the CyP-A·CsA complex, the CyP-A·SfA complex does not inhibit calcineurin (14Zenke G. Strittmatter U. Fuchs S. Quesniaux V.F. Brinkmann V. Schuler W. Zurini M. Enz A. Billich A.

Maurer C. Schilling W. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1999; 52: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Rather, SfA specifically blocks T cell proliferation in response to interleukin 2 through a mechanism involving an NFκB-mediated increase in the expression of the tumor suppressor genes p53 and p21, with the latter binding to and inhibiting the appearance of cell cycle kinase activity cyclin E-Cdk2 (14Zenke G. Strittmatter U. Fuchs S. Quesniaux V.F. Brinkmann V. Schuler W. Zurini M. Enz A. Billich A. Sanglier J.J. Fehr T. J.

Liu J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43534-43540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). If SfA were able to bind tightly to CyP-D and inhibit its PPIase activity and the opening of the MPTP, its lack of effect on calcineurin might make it an alternative to N-Me-Ala-6-cyclosporin A andN-Me-Val-4-cyclosporin A in studying the role of the MPTP in cell death. Here, we demonstrate that SfA is as potent as CsA as an inhibitor of the PPIase activity of CyP-D and of MPTP opening. It is also able to improve functional recovery of rat hearts reperfused following an ischemic episode, as well as reduce necrotic damage. However, SfA shows some important differences from CsA in its mode of action on the MPTP. It demonstrates a sigmoidal rather than a hyperbolic dose-response curve for MPTP inhibition and does not prevent CyP-D binding to the ANT. These data provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of the MPTP. Percoll-purified rat liver mitochondria and SMPs were prepared as described previously (18Halestrap A.P. Woodfield K.Y. Connern C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3346-3354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 19Owen M.R. Doran E. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). For measurement of MPTP opening under de-energized conditions, they were stored on ice overnight before use to deplete them of adenine nucleotides (18Halestrap A.P. Woodfield K.Y. Connern C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3346-3354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The opening of the MPTP was determined under energized or de-energized conditions by following the decrease in light scattering (monitored as A 520) that accompanies mitochondrial swelling at 25 °C (6Halestrap A.P. Davidson A.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The buffer for energized conditions was 125 mm KCl, 20 mm Mops, 10 mm Tris, 2 mm potassium Pi, 2 mm succinate, 0.5 μm rotenone, pH 7.2, and for de-energized conditions was 150 mm KSCN, 20 mm Mops, 10 mm Tris, 2 mmnitrilotriacetic acid, 2 μmA23187, 0.5 μmrotenone, 0.5 μm antimycin A, pH 7.2. Additions of CsA (Calbiochem) or SfA (Novartis) were made as required. MPTP opening was initiated by addition of CaCl2 to give the free [Ca2+] indicated. The sensitivity of the MPTP to [Ca2+] was also determined by following the shrinkage of pre-swollen mitochondria (as an increase inA 520) upon the addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG-2000) as described previously (18Halestrap A.P. Woodfield K.Y. Connern C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3346-3354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 20Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). De-energized buffer was used, and pre-swollen mitochondria were preincubated for 2 min with the required [Ca2+] and other additions before initiation of shrinkage by the addition of 7% (w/v) PEG. The rates of swelling and shrinking of mitochondria were determined by differentiation of theA 520 time course (18Halestrap A.P. Woodfield K.Y. Connern C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3346-3354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The PPIase activity of recombinant CyP-D (produced by thrombin cleavage of GST-CyP-D (21Woodfield K. Ruck A. Brdiczka D. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar)) was determined by following the rate of hydrolysis ofN-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide by chymotrypsin as described previously (6Halestrap A.P. Davidson A.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 7Griffiths E.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Chymotrypsin only hydrolyzes the trans form of the peptide, and hydrolysis of the cis form, the concentration of which is maximized by using a stock dissolved in trifluoroethanol containing 470 mm LiCl (22Garciaecheverria C. Kofron J.L. Kuzmic P. Rich D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), is limited by the rate ofcis-trans isomerization. Recombinant CyP-D (10 μg), prepared as described previously (21Woodfield K. Ruck A. Brdiczka D. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), was added to 100 μg of SMPs (4 mg protein/ml in isolation medium) and incubated for 15 min at 22 °C before sedimenting by centrifugation (157,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C). After being washed once in isolation buffer, bound CyP-D was determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-CyP-D antibodies (21Woodfield K. Ruck A. Brdiczka D. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This was performed essentially as described previously using detergent-solubilized purified inner mitochondrial membrane and recombinant GST-CyP-D bound to glutathione-Sepharose (21Woodfield K. Ruck A. Brdiczka D. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). When required, the bound GST-CyP-D was preincubated with CsA or SfA (25 μm) for 15 min at 22 °C prior to the addition of solubilized inner mitochondrial membranes. After extensive washing the specifically bound protein was then eluted with glutathione and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-ANT antibodies (21Woodfield K. Ruck A. Brdiczka D. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Isolated rat hearts were perfused in the Langendorff mode as described previously (23Griffiths E.J. Halestrap A.P. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1993; 25: 1461-1469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) with continuous monitoring of left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) using a pressure transducer connected to a water-filled balloon inserted into the left ventricle. Following control perfusion for 50 min, with the addition of CsA or SfA as required, perfusion was halted to initiate global isothermic (37 °C) ischemia. After 30 min, ischemia perfusion was restarted and was continued for 10 min in the presence of drug and a further 20 min in its absence. Samples of perfusate were collected prior to ischemia and every 1 min during reperfusion for the determination of lactate dehydrogenase activity spectrophotometrically. In Fig. 1 we show that SfA inhibits the PPIase activity of recombinant CyP-D with a K i(±S.E.) of 2.2 ± 0.7 nm, a potency similar to that of CsA (6Halestrap A.P. Davidson A.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 7Griffiths E.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2 a we demonstrate that submicromolar concentrations of SfA inhibit opening of the MPTP of energized mitochondria induced by 100 nmol of Ca2+/mg of mitochondrial protein. However, the concentration dependence of inhibition was complex, with the lowest concentration of SfA (100 nm) failing to exhibit any inhibition no matter how long the mitochondria were exposed to the drug. We have previously shown (18Halestrap A.P. Woodfield K.Y. Connern C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3346-3354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) that energized mitochondria are not ideal for probing the mechanism of the MPTP because many factors can affect the sensitivity of pore opening to [Ca2+]. These include changes in membrane potential, matrix adenine nucleotide concentrations, and calcium transport (18Halestrap A.P. Woodfield K.Y. Connern C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3346-3354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). In addition, the accumulation of calcium in the presence of phosphate can lead to an increase in light scattering prior to pore opening that becomes dominant when the MPTP is inhibited (6Halestrap A.P. Davidson A.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 24Novgorodov S.A. Gudz T.I. Milgrom Y.M. Brierley G.P. J. Biol.

Lemasters J.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). This is apparent in Fig 2 a. For this reason, we routinely use de-energized conditions (iso-osmotic KSCN buffer with respiratory chain inhibitors) in the presence of the calcium ionophore A23187 to ensure that calcium equilibrates across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondria are also stored overnight following their preparation because they lose a fair proportion of their adenine nucleotides during the first few hours of storage on ice, which causes the sensitivity of the MPTP toward calcium to change over this period. Using these conditions it is possible to obtain detailed dose-response curves for CsA analogues allowing calculation of K 0.5values that closely match the K i for inhibition of the PPIase activity of CyP-D (6Halestrap A.P. Davidson A.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 7Griffiths E.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar).Figure 2Inhibition of the MPTP by SfA. Inpanel a, MPTP opening in rat liver mitochondria (1.5 mg protein/ml) was assayed under energized conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) by monitoring the decrease inA 520 with a split beam spectrophotometer after the addition of 100 μm CaCl2 to the sample cuvette. When present, SfA or CsA were added at the concentrations shown at 2 min before calcium addition. Inpanel b the protocol was similar, but de-energized conditions were employed and pore opening initiated by the addition of CaCl2 to give a calculated free concentration of 100 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The data of Fig. 2 b show some typical traces for the inhibition of the MPTP by CsA and SfA under such de-energized conditions, whereas in Fig. 3 we present detailed dose-response curves. These data show clearly that CsA and SfA behave differently. Whereas inhibition by CsA is progressive and can be fitted to the equation for binding to a single site as described previously (6Halestrap A.P. Davidson A.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 7Griffiths E.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), the inhibition by SfA is sigmoidal with little or no inhibition apparent at low inhibitor concentrations. However, a steep concentration dependence for inhibition developed as SfA reached a concentration at which CsA gave about 50% inhibition, the value being dependent on the concentration of mitochondria in the assay (Fig.3 b). The concentration of SfA required to inhibit pore opening by >80% was almost identical to that when CsA was used (Fig3 a), consistent with both inhibitors associating with the same target protein (CyP-D). SfA also inhibited the MPTP when assayed using the shrinkage assay, and here too the concentration dependence for inhibition was sigmoidal as shown in Fig.4 a. The effect of SfA, like that by CsA (18Halestrap A.P. Woodfield K.Y. Connern C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3346-3354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), was to decrease the sensitivity of the MPTP to [Ca2+] as shown in Fig. 4 b. Thus, even in the presence of a concentration of SfA that gave maximal inhibition (1 μm), the pore could be opened at higher [Ca2+].Figure 4The effect of SfA on the calcium dependence of the MPTP. In both panels the extent of MPTP opening was determined by measuring the rate of shrinkage of pre-swollen mitochondria upon the addition of 7% (w/v) PEG as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In panel a the pre-swollen mitochondria were incubated for 2 min with 50 μm[Ca2+] and the concentration of SfA shown before the addition of PEG to initiate shrinkage. In panel b the concentration of Ca2+ was varied as indicated in the absence or presence of 1 μm SfA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effects of SfA and CsA on CyP-D binding to SMPs were compared, and the data are shown in Fig.5 a. SfA slightly increased the binding of recombinant CyP-D to SMPs (lane 4), unlike CsA, which greatly reduced binding (lane 3) as observed previously (12Nicolli A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Wenger R.M. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2185-2192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 20Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In nine such experiments the mean binding of CyP-D in the presence of SfA as percentage of control (±S.E.) was 132 ± 12% (p < 0.05), whereas for CsA the binding was reduced to 34 ± 8% (p < 0.001). Treatment of the CyP-D with SfA before (lane 7) or after (lane 6) CsA treatment overcame the CsA inhibition of CyP-D binding. A slight reversal of CyP-D binding to SMPs was detected when CsA was added after CyP-D was already bound (lane 8), but again no effect of SfA was observed (lane 9). These data suggest that CsA binds to CyP-D at the same site as the ANT, whereas SfA binds to a distinct site that actually enhances CyP-D binding to the ANT while displacing bound CsA. Further evidence in favor of this interpretation was obtained when the effects of CsA and SfA on the binding of ANT present in detergent-solubilized inner mitochondrial membranes to a GST-CyP-D affinity column were studied (Fig. 5 b). ANT binding was enhanced by pretreatment of mitochondria with diamide and inhibited by pretreatment of the GST-CyP-D with CsA as found previously (21Woodfield K. Ruck A. Brdiczka D. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In contrast, SfA did not prevent binding, and in the case of diamide-treated mitochondria, the binding of ANT was actually increased by SfA. The MPTP has now been recognized as playing a critical role in both necrotic and apoptotic cell death, and evidence for this has come from the ability of CsA to protect cells from a variety of death signals (1Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar, 2Halestrap A.P. Doran E. Gillespie J.P. O'Toole A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 3Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). We and others (23Griffiths E.J. Halestrap A.P. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1993; 25: 1461-1469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 29Nazareth W. Yafei N. Crompton M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1991; 23: 1351-1354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 30DiLisa F. Menabo R. Canton M. Barile M. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2571-2575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the necrotic damage associated with reperfusion of the ischemic rat heart (irreversible reperfusion injury) can be protected by pretreatment of the heart with CsA, with optimal effects being observed at 0.2 μm. Thus it would be expected that SfA might act in the same manner. Initial experiments using Langendorff perfused rat hearts subjected to 30 min of global ischemia followed by reperfusion failed to show any protective effects of 0.2 μm SfA when functional recovery was determined by measurement of LVDP and LVEDP. One explanation of why SfA gave no protection under these conditions would be that it fails to reach the mitochondria in the perfused heart. To test this possibility the experiments reported in Fig. 6 were performed. In Fig. 6 a we investigated whether, following treatment of mitochondria with SfA, the drug remains bound to CyP-D through extensive washing of mitochondria in the absence of SfA. Mitochondria pretreated with 1 μm CsA and then washed free of CsA exhibited greatly reduced MPTP opening in response to Ca2+when compared with untreated mitochondria, although the inhibition was not as complete as when the CsA was added directly to the assay. These data suggest that some CsA dissociated from CyP-D during the washing. In contrast, mitochondria pretreated with 1 μm SfA maintained complete inhibition of the MPTP following washing. These data indicate that SfA dissociates from CyP-D less readily than CsA. In addition, they imply that if SfA has access to mitochondria within the perfused heart, this will be detected as an inhibition of the MPTP in subsequently isolated mitochondria. In Fig. 6 b we demonstrate that this is the case. In hearts pretreated with 0.2 μm CsA for 3 min, the conditions found optimal for protecting hearts from reperfusion injury (23Griffiths E.J. Halestrap A.P. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1993; 25: 1461-1469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), some inhibition of MPTP opening was detected at both 100 and 200 μm Ca2+. In contrast, treatment with 0.2 μm SfA for 5 min gave no detectable inhibition of the MPTP, consistent with its inability to protect hearts from reperfusion injury under these conditions. However, when hearts were perfused with 1 μm SfA for 10 min, almost total inhibition of the MPTP could be demonstrated. This inhibition is unlikely to be due to the carry over of SfA into the isolation buffer because the total amount of extracellular medium in the heart (about 0.5 ml) contains only 500 pmol of SfA. This compares with a mitochondrial CyP-D content of the heart of >2000 pmol (calculated from data in Refs. 11Griffiths E.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar and 31Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, we have confirmed this conclusion experimentally in two ways. First, when 1 μm SfA was perfused through the heart for only 1 min prior to mitochondrial preparation, opening of the MPTP was similar to control mitochondria (data not shown). Second, when hearts were exposed to 1 μm SfA for 10 min and then the SfA removed by a 30-s perfusion with SfA-free buffer, the MPTP opening in subsequently isolated mitochondria remained inhibited even at 1 mmcalcium (Fig. 6 b). Thus it would be predicted that these conditions should protect hearts from reperfusion injury; the data of Fig. 7 demonstrate that this is indeed the case. In Fig. 7 a we show that pretreatment of hearts with 0.2 μm CsA for 3 min before 30 min of global ischemia greatly improved function recovery of the heart during reperfusion, as reflected in the greater LVDP (69 ± 8% of pre-ischemic values,cf. control value of 26 ± 8%; p < 0.01) and lower LVEDP (37 ± 6 mm Hg, cf. control value of 64 ± 6; p < 0.01). These data confirm previous data from our and other laboratories (23Griffiths E.J. Halestrap A.P. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1993; 25: 1461-1469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 30DiLisa F. Menabo R. Canton M. Barile M. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2571-2575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Very similar results were obtained when hearts were pretreated with 1 μm SfA for 10 min, with recovery of LVDP being 79 ± 10% of pre-ischemic values and the LVEDP being 33 ± 4 mm Hg (both p < 0.01 versus controls). To confirm that this functional protection reflects an inhibition of necrotic cell death during reperfusion, lactate dehydrogenase release was determined, and the results are reported in Fig. 7 b. It is clear that both SfA and CsA greatly reduce lactate dehydrogenase release coincident with their protection of heart function. We have shown previously (6Halestrap A.P. Davidson A.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 7Griffiths E.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 18Halestrap A.P.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8172-8180Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and confirm here that CsA binds to CyP-D, inhibiting its PPIase activity and preventing its binding to the ANT. This would appear to be the mechanism by which CsA inhibits opening of the MPTP as we originally proposed (6Halestrap A.P. Davidson A.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). In contrast, SfA inhibits the PPIase activity of CyP-D (Fig. 1) and inhibits MPTP opening (Figs.Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) without preventing CyP-D binding to the ANT (Fig. 5). It seems probable that both CsA and SfA act to inhibit the MPTP via their binding to CyP-D because the concentration of each required to inhibit pore opening by >80% is almost identical (Fig. 3 a). However, our data imply that SfA and CsA bind to CyP-D at different sites. In both cases the PPIase activity is inhibited, but only for CsA does binding of the inhibitor prevent binding of CyP-D to the ANT. Thus the SfA·CyP-D complex can still bind to the ANT but is unable to facilitate the conformational change, triggered by [Ca2+], that induces pore opening. This allows a further conclusion to be drawn. Binding of CyP-D alone is not sufficient to promote pore opening; a subsequent conformational change, catalyzed by the PPIase activity of CyP-D, must then occur that is inhibited by SfA. CsA prevents the PPIase-dependent conformational change because it prevents CyP-D binding, whereas SfA still allows CyP-D binding but not the subsequent conformational change. A further insight into the mechanism of the MPTP is provided by the sigmoidal nature of the concentration dependence of pore opening by SfA (Figs. 3 and 4). These data imply that SfA only inhibits pore opening once a significant proportion (about 50%) of the matrix CyP-D has bound SfA. This contrasts with CsA, where inhibition occurs directly in proportion to the amount bound to CyP-D (Fig. 3) (6Halestrap A.P. Davidson A.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 7Griffiths E.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 20Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The most probable explanation of this observation is that the MPTP is a multi-subunit complex, with the CyP-D-mediated conformational change required to open the pore involving co-operative interactions between the subunits. The simplest model, illustrated in Fig.8, would be that the ANT, which exists as a dimer, must bind two CyP-D molecules to induce the conformational change required to prime the MPTP to open upon triggering with Ca2+. Even if one of the two CyP-D molecules has SfA bound, the conformational change will occur, but if both of the bound CyP-D molecules are associated with SfA, the conformational change cannot occur. However, a CyP-D-independent conformational change of the ANT can also induce pore opening at high levels of [Ca2+] (33Brustovetsky N. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8483-8488Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), which may explain why pore opening can still be observed in the presence of the maximally inhibiting concentration of SfA when higher levels of [Ca2+] are employed (Fig.4 b). It should be noted that our data do not eliminate other models for the MPTP pore. Thus a membrane protein other than the ANT may be the true target, or an additional target, of CyP-D binding that is responsible for MPTP formation. Indeed He and Lemasters (28He L. Lemasters J.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) have suggested that many misfolded proteins may be capable of producing pores but are prevented from doing so by the binding of CyP-D and other chaperone proteins. This interaction may be disrupted by a calcium-mediated conformational change induced by the PPIase activity of CyP-D and blocked by CsA (28He L. Lemasters J.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Our data could be reconciled with such a model by substituting a denatured protein aggregate for the dimeric ANT shown in our scheme (Fig. 8). However, the well documented effects on the MPTP of adenine nucleotides and other ligands of the ANT, such as bongkrekic acid and carboxyatractyloside (18Halestrap A.P. Woodfield K.Y. Connern C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3346-3354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), are strongly suggestive that the ANT is the key membrane component that operates under most pathophysiological conditions. So too is the ability of the purified reconstituted ANT to form a nonspecific channel at high [Ca2+] (33Brustovetsky N. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8483-8488Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), which in the presence of CyP-D is opened at lower [Ca2+] in a CsA-sensitive manner (2Halestrap A.P. Doran E. Gillespie J.P. O'Toole A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar,34Crompton M. Virji S. Ward J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). To establish a role for the MPTP in apoptotic cell death, many workers have relied on the use of either CsA or bongkrekic acid as specific inhibitors of the MPTP. In reality, neither of these agents is specific. The use of bongkrekic acid is especially suspect, because its primary effect is to inhibit ATP/ADP transport across the mitochondrial inner membrane, a process that is fundamental to the metabolic and bioenergetic integrity of almost all cells. The use of CsA is open to criticism because when bound to CyP-A it inhibits the calcium-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin, which has many intracellular roles (8Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). This may, in part, explain why protection of hearts from reperfusion injury by CsA is critically dependent on its concentration, with optimal effects being observed at 0.2 μm (23Griffiths E.J. Halestrap A.P. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1993; 25: 1461-1469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 29Nazareth W. Yafei N. Crompton M. J. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2571-2575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). There are CsA analogues such asN-Me-Ala-6-cyclosporin A andN-Me-Val-4-cyclosporin A that do not inhibit calcineurin activity and yet still inhibit the PPIase activity of CyP-D, antagonize the opening of the MPTP and protecting cells from apoptotic and necrotic cell death (11Griffiths E.J.

Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3194-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). SfA also lacks the ability to inhibit calcineurin (14Zenke G. Strittmatter U. Fuchs S. Quesniaux V.F. Brinkmann V.

It thus represents an important new specific tool for exploring the role of the MPTP in cell death, which may have advantages over CsA analogues as a protective agent against reperfusion injury and other cellular stresses that cause cell death through MPTP opening. The immunosuppressant activity of SfA is exerted by blocking T cell proliferation in response to interleukin 2, through a mechanism involving an NFκB-mediated increase in the expression of the tumor suppressor genes p53 andp21, with the latter binding to and inhibiting the appearance of cell cycle kinase activity cyclin E-Cdk2 (14Zenke G.

Whether this action of SfA on the cell cycle will have any detrimental effects when the drug is used to inhibit reperfusion injury is unknown, although the relatively short time scales involved in reperfusion after ischemia would suggest not. In conclusion, SfA provides new clues to the molecular mechanism of the MPTP and represents an important additional tool for studying the role of the MPTP in both necrotic and apoptotic cell death. The lack of any effect of SfA on calcineurin activity may also make it an appropriate therapeutic agent for the protection of tissues from reperfusion injury. Two situations of particular importance in this regard are the treatment of stroke and coronary thrombosis, where reperfusion of the ischemic area following clot disruption may induce necrotic or apoptotic cell death. Finally, our data demonstrate that there are two distinct sites on CyP-D that may be targeted in the design of novel inhibitors of the MPTP that could be used therapeutically to protect from reperfusion injury.

https://openalex.org/W2032189958,"The process of amyloid fibril formation by the human calcitonin hormone is associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma. Based on the effect of pH on the fibrillization of human calcitonin, the analysis of conformationally constrained analogues of the hormone, and our suggestion regarding the role of aromatic residues in the process of amyloid fibril formation, we studied the ability of a short aromatic charged peptide fragment of calcitonin (NH<sub>2</sub>-DFNKF-COOH) to form amyloid fibrils. Here, using structural and biophysical analysis, we clearly demonstrate the ability of this short peptide to form well ordered amyloid fibrils. A shorter truncated tetrapeptide, NH<sub>2</sub>-DFNK-COOH, also formed fibrils albeit less ordered than those formed by the pentapeptide. We could not detect amyloid fibril formation by the NH<sub>2</sub>-FNKF-COOH tetrapeptide, the NH<sub>2</sub>-DFN-COOH tripeptide, or the NH<sub>2</sub>-DANKA-COOH phenylalanine to the alanine analogue of the pentapeptide. The formation of amyloid fibrils by rather hydrophilic peptides is quite striking, because it was speculated that hydrophobic interactions might play a key role in amyloid formation. This is the first reported case of fibril formation by a peptide as short as a tetrapeptide and one of very few cases of amyloid formation by pentapeptides. Because the aromatic nature seems to be the only common property of the various very short amyloid-forming peptides, it further supports our hypothesis on the role of aromatic interactions in the process of amyloid fibril formation."

TRPV4 is characterized by both inward and outward rectification, voltage-dependent block by Ruthenium Red, a moderate selectivity for divalent versus monovalent cations, and an Eisenman IV permeability sequence. We identify two aspartate residues, Asp672 and Asp682, as important determinants of the Ca2+ sensitivity of the TRPV4 pore. Neutralization of either aspartate to alanine caused a moderate reduction of the relative permeability for divalent cations and of the degree of outward rectification. Neutralizing both aspartates simultaneously caused a much stronger reduction of Ca2+permeability and channel rectification and additionally altered the permeability order for monovalent cations toward Eisenman sequence II or I. Moreover, neutralizing Asp682 but not Asp672 strongly reduces the affinity of the channel for Ruthenium Red. Mutations to Met680, which is located at the center of a putative selectivity filter, strongly reduced whole cell current amplitude and impaired Ca2+ permeation. In contrast, neutralizing the only positively charged residue in the putative pore region, Lys675, had no obvious effects on the properties of the TRPV4 channel pore.

Therefore, the functional importance of this channel may be connected to its role as a promiscuous Ca2+ influx channel integrating multiple physical and chemical stimuli. Based on their pore properties, the TRPV subfamily can be subdivided into two groups.

In the present study, we were led by a sequence comparison of the pore region of the TRPVs to search for possible molecular determinants for the pore features of TRPV4 and identify several residues that contribute to the permeability profile and blocker sensitivity of the channel. We used the recombinant bicistronic expression plasmid pdiTRP12, which carries the entire protein-coding region for murine TRPV4 (mouse mTRP12; accession numberCAC20703) and for green fluorescent protein coupled by an IRES sequence. Human embryonic kidney cells, HEK293, were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% (v/v) human serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 2 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidity controlled incubator with 10% CO2. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the above-described vector using methods described previously (9Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Prenen J. Stuiver M. Willems P.H. Droogmans G. Nilius B.

Positively transfected cells were visually identified based on their green fluorescence. Nontransfected cells from the same batch were used as controls. Mutations to the TRPV4 pore were made using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The nucleotide sequences of the mutants have been verified by sequencing of the corresponding cDNAs. The standard extracellular solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, buffered at pH 7.4 with NaOH. The osmolality of this solution, as measured with a vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor 5500, Schlag, Gladbach, Germany), was 320 ± 5 mosmol. When indicated in the figure legends, the Ca2+ concentration of this solution was varied between 0 and 30 mm. To study the relative permeability of mono- and divalent cations, we used extracellular solutions containing 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and either 150 mmXCl (where X = sodium, lithium, cesium, potassium, or rubidium) or 30 mmXCl2 (X = calcium or magnesium) and 120 N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride. These solutions were titrated to pH 7.4 with the appropriate base. Two different intracellular solutions were used yielding virtually identical results after correcting for the liquid junction potential (see below). The cesium-based solution contained 20 mmCsCl, 100 mm cesium aspartate, 1 mmMgCl2, 4 mm Na2ATP, 0.022 mm CaCl2, 10 mm BAPTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH.

Whole cell membrane currents were monitored with an EPC-9 (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany; 8-Pole Bessel filter, 2.9 kHz) using ruptured patches. Patch electrodes had a DC resistance between 2 and 4 mΩ when filled with intracellular solution. An Ag-AgCl wire was used as a reference electrode. Capacitance and access resistance were monitored continuously. Between 50 and 70% of the series resistance was electronically compensated to minimize voltage errors. Unless mentioned otherwise, we have applied a ramp protocol consisting of a 20-ms voltage step to −100 mV followed by a 380-ms linear ramp to +100 mV. This protocol was repeated every 5 s. The currents were sampled at 1.25 kHz. The time course of the whole cell current and current densities were obtained by averaging the current in a narrow window around −80 mV during the voltage ramp protocol. All of the experiments were performed at room temperature (20–23 °C). The relative permeability of monovalent cations was calculated from the shift in reversal potential after complete substitution of extracellular Na+ by the specific cation, according to the following equation.

Overall statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance. In case of significance (p < 0.01), individual groups were compared using Student’s ttest. Fig.1 shows an alignment of the putative pore region of murine TRPV4 (residues 663–686) with the corresponding regions of the other members of the TRPV subfamily and of the bacterial potassium channel KcsA. In this region, TRPV4 has the highest homology with TRPV1 and TRPV2, with which it shares a central stretch of 11 highly conserved amino acids. There is also significant homology with TRPV5 and TRPV6 and, to a lesser extent, with the pore region of KcsA. When comparing TRPV1/2/4 with the highly Ca2+-selective TRPV5/TRPV6 pores two differences are immediately obvious. Firstly, the TRPV1/2/4 pores contain a positively charged lysine (Lys675in TRPV4), which is not present in TRPV5/6. Secondly, TRPV1/2/4 contain a methionine (Met680 in TRPV4) at the position corresponding to Asp542 in TRPV5 (Asp541 in TRPV6), which is crucial for the high Ca2+ selectivity of the latter channel. Moreover, TRPV4 contains two negatively charged residues within the conserved stretch of 11 amino acids: Asp672, which is conserved among all TRPVs, and Asp682, which is not present in TRPV5/6 and corresponds to Asp646 in TRPV1, a residue involved in Ruthenium Red block and Mg2+ permeability. To assess the contribution of these TRPV4 pore residues to the pore properties of the channel, we constructed seven cDNAs coding for TRPV4 channels in which point mutations were introduced into the pore. Charged residues were neutralized (mutants D672A, D682A, and K675A and double mutant D572A/D682A), the pore methionine residue was substituted by an alanine (mutant M680A), and, to mimic the TRPV5/6 pore, a negative charge was introduced, either alone or in combination with a deletion of the positively charged Lys675 (mutants M680D and M680D/ΔK675). As shown in Fig. 2, all seven mutants expressed as functional ion channels, as indicated by the activation of a cation current upon stimulation of transfected HEK293 cells with the specific TRPV4 activator 4α-PDD. When compared with wild type TRPV4, the current densities were significantly larger for the D572A, D582A, and D572A/D582A mutants, whereas mutations to Met680 led to a reduction in current density. These differences in current density could arise from alterations in plasma membrane expression, single-channel conductance, or sensitivity toward activation by 4α-PDD. This latter possibility would not be unprecedented, because gating of TRPV1 by extracellular protons critically depends on a negatively charged residue (Glu646) within the TRPV1 pore region (17Jordt S.-E. Tominaga M. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8134-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), but more work is needed to elucidate a possible involvement of pore residues in activation of TRPV4. In this manuscript, we focus on the contribution of these residues to typical pore properties: permeability, rectification, and voltage-dependent block. It has been previously shown that TRPV4 is moderately selective for Ca2+ over Na+ ions and displays a monovalent cation permeability sequence corresponding to Eisenman IV. We investigated whether these properties are affected by mutations to the putative pore region by determining the relative cation permeabilities for all mutant channels. After full activation of the current with 4α-PDD, we switched between extracellular solutions containing a single permeant cation species and calculated relative permeabilities from the shifts in the reversal potential after correcting for liquid junction potentials (see “Materials and Methods”). For wild type TRPV4, switching from a Na+-containing extracellular solution to solutions containing 30 mm Ca2+ or Mg2+ as the sole permeant cation caused a decrease of the inward current at negative potentials and a rightward shift of the reversal potential (Fig. 3A). Relative permeabilities calculated according to Equation 3 were 6.85 ± 0.55 (n = 25) and 2.52 ± 0.29 (n= 7) for Ca2+ and Mg2+, respectively. Substituting extracellular Na+ by other monovalent cations caused only small shifts in the reversal potential (Fig.4A), confirming that TRPV4 poorly discriminates between monovalent cations. The deduced monovalent cation permeability sequence was K+ > Cs+ ≥ Rb+ > Na+ > Li+, which corresponds to Eisenman sequence IV for a weak field strength site. A possible explanation for the relatively low Ca2+selectivity and the weak field strength of the TRPV4, TRPV1, and TRPV2 pores could be the presence of a positively charged lysine (Lys675 in TRPV4) in the central part of the putative pore region, which is not present in the strong field strength site TRPV5 and TRPV6 pores. However, neutralizing this lysine into alanine (mutant K675A) had no significant effect on the divalent selectivity of the channel (Fig. 3B). Likewise, the K675A pore still poorly discriminates between monovalent cations (Fig. 4B) and retains the Eisenman IV permeation profile. Thus, the low field strength binding site is conserved, indicating that Lys675does not significantly influence the electrical field within the TRPV4 channel pore. The two negatively charged residues in the pore region, Asp672 and Asp682, could potentially function as (part of) Ca2+-binding sites within the TRPV4 pore, similar to the role played by aspartate and glutamate residues in the Ca2+ selective pores of TRPV5, TRPV6, and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Consistent with such a role, we found that the D672A and D682A mutants both displayed a reduced Ca2+selectivity, as can be judged from the less positive reversal potentials upon switching to a Ca2+-containing extracellular solution (Fig. 3, C and D). The relative Ca2+ permeability (PCa/PNa) was approximately halved in both mutants, to 3.20 ± 0.70 (n = 4; p < 0.05) and 4.09 ± 0.22 (n = 5; p < 0.05) for D672A and D682A, respectively (Table I). Likewise, inward current densities with 30 mm Ca2+ as the sole charge carrier were significantly smaller for both mutants than for wild type TRPV4 despite the significantly larger current densities in Na+-containing solutions (Fig. 2), indicating that Ca2+ conduction is hindered when these pore aspartates are neutralized. Like wild type TRPV4, the D672A and D682A pores discriminate poorly between monovalent cations and display the Eisenman IV permeation profile (Fig. 4C and data not shown). However, we found that both channels display a significantly higher relative permeability for K+ ions, withPK/PNa values of 1.63 ± 0.10 (D672A, n = 5; p < 0.05) and 1.58 ± 0.07 (D682A, n = 6;p < 0.05) compared with 1.35 ± 0.03 (n = 10) for wild type TRPV4 (Table I).Table IRelative permeabilities of wild type and mutant TRPV4 channelsChannelPCa/PNaPMg/PNaPK/PNaPRb/PNaPCs/PNaPLi/PNaEisenman1-aThe values in brackets indicate the number of times a selectivity sequence was observed and the number of trials.Wild type6.9 ± 0.62.5 ± 0.31.35 ± 0.031.27 ± 0.041.32 ± 0.030.78 ± 0.08IV (9/10)K675A6.3 ± 0.61.7 ± 0.21.35 ± 0.021.32 ± 0.021.26 ± 0.110.73 ± 0.06IV (17/21)D672A3.2 ± 0.71.9 ± 0.21.60 ± 0.141.37 ± 0.021.37 ± 0.160.80 ± 0.09IV (5/6)D682A4.1 ± 0.31.7 ± 0.21.58 ± 0.071.52 ± 0.041.43 ± 0.090.86 ± 0.06IV (6/6)D672A/D682A2.5 ± 0.2≪11-bVery small inward currents and strong leftward shift of the reversal potential, indicative of a negligible permeability.1.22 ± 0.031.28 ± 0.031.23 ± 0.020.73 ± 0.03I (5/8), II (2/8)M680A3.3 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.12.37 ± 0.341.68 ± 0.111.56 ± 0.050.69 ± 0.10IV (7/7)M680D≪11-bVery small inward currents and strong leftward shift of the reversal potential, indicative of a negligible permeability.≪11-bVery small inward currents and strong leftward shift of the reversal potential, indicative of a negligible permeability.2.09 ± 0.152.01 ± 0.301.40 ± 0.090.63 ± 0.06IV (8/8)M680D/ΔK675≪11-bVery small inward currents and strong leftward shift of the reversal potential, indicative of a negligible permeability.≪11-bVery small inward currents and strong leftward shift of the reversal potential, indicative of a negligible permeability.1.92 ± 0.091.81 ± 0.261.49 ± 0.090.61 ± 0.07IV (5/5)The relative permeabilities were calculated as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data are given as the means ± S.E. from at least three cells.1-a The values in brackets indicate the number of times a selectivity sequence was observed and the number of trials.1-b Very small inward currents and strong leftward shift of the reversal potential, indicative of a negligible permeability. Open table in a new tab The relative permeabilities were calculated as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data are given as the means ± S.E. from at least three cells. Simultaneous neutralization of both aspartates (double mutant D672A/D682A) induced some more drastic changes in permeation phenotype. The relative Ca2+ permeability was even more reduced than in the single mutants (Fig. 3E;PCa/ PNa = 2.45 ± 0.19, n = 12; p < 0.01), and there was no longer a measurable permeability for Mg2+. Moreover, the permeability sequence for monovalent cations was different from that of wild type, with both Cs+ and Rb+ being more permeant than K+ in 7 of 8 cells (Fig. 4D). The observed Cs+ ≈ Rb+ > K+ > Na+ > Li+ permeability sequence is consistent with a reduction of the field strength of the cation-binding site to Eisenman sequence II or I (Table I). We also observed important differences in the rectification properties between wild type TRPV4 and the D672A/D682A mutant, which, as will be discussed below, arise from differences in Ca2+ block. From the sequence comparison in Fig. 1, two lines of evidence indicated that Met680 is positioned at a potentially crucial position within the putative pore region of TRPV4. Firstly, at the corresponding position in TRPV5 we found an aspartate (residue 542), which is crucial for the high Ca2+ selectivity of this channel. Secondly, at the corresponding position in voltage-gated K+ channels there is a tyrosine, part of the so-called K+ channel “signature sequence” (T(V/I)GYG), whose backbone atoms contribute to the lining of the K+ selectivity filter. Mutants in which Met680 was substituted by alanine or aspartate gave rise to sizable but strongly reduced current densities upon stimulation with 4α-PDD (Fig. 2), which may have some quantitative bearings on the determination of relative permeabilities of the M680A, M680D, and M680D/ΔK675 mutants. Still, some drastic changes in divalent permeability of these mutants were obvious. In the M680A mutant, switching from a Na+-containing extracellular solution a solution containing 30 mm Ca2+ as the sole permeant cation caused a rightward shift of the reversal potential (Fig. 3F), corresponding to aPCa/PNa value of 3.26 ± 0.09 (n = 6; p < 0.05). Under the same conditions, we observed a leftward shift of the reversal potential for the M680D and M680D/ΔK675 mutants (Fig. 3, Gand H), indicating that these pore mutations abolish the Ca2+ selectivity of the TRPV4 pore (PCa/PNa values ≪1;p < 0.01). Compared with wild type TRPV4, no changes in the monovalent permeability sequence (Eisenman IV) were observed (data not shown), but all three mutants had a significantly higher relative permeability for K+ (Table I). The current-voltage relation of wild type TRPV4 in extracellular solutions containing “physiological” concentrations of mono- and divalent cations displays both inward and outward rectification. As illustrated in Fig.5A, this behavior strongly depends on the extracellular Ca2+ concentration. In the absence of divalent cations, the current-voltage relation is linear with identical current amplitudes at +100 and −100 mV. Increasing concentrations of Ca2+ cause an inhibition of the current that is more pronounced at negative potentials, characteristic of a voltage-dependent block. However, Ca2+concentrations up to 30 mm do not cause a complete block of the inward current, because Ca2+ itself permeates the channel, as evidenced by the rightward shift of the reversal potential. To quantify the effect of extracellular Ca2+ we normalized the inward current at −100 mV to the outward current at +100 mV, assuming that the Ca2+ block disappears at highly positive potentials (Fig. 5D). For wild type TRPV4, theI−100 mV/I+100 mVratio decreased from ∼1 in nominally Ca2+-free solution to ∼0.25 in the presence of 30 mm Ca2+. Virtually identical results were obtained for the K675A mutant, again indicating that this residue is not an important determinant of TRPV4 pore properties (Fig. 5D and data not shown). In contrast, neutralization of Asp672 and Asp682 strongly reduced the sensitivity of the channel to extracellular Ca2+. In the D672A/D682A double mutant, the current-voltage relation was still completely linear with 1 mmCa2+ in the extracellular solution (Fig. 5B), and outward rectification remained reduced for Ca2+concentrations up to 30 mm (Fig. 5, B andD). The Ca2+-dependent rectification properties of the single mutants D672A and D682A were intermediate between wild type and the D672A/D682A double mutant (Fig.5D), which can also be appreciated from the normalized current-voltage relations measured with 5 mm extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that both aspartate residues contribute to the Ca2+ sensitivity of the TRPV4 pore. Ruthenium Red (RR) is a polycationic molecule that has been shown to inhibit members of the TRPV family with nanomolar to low micromolar affinity. As illustrated in Fig.6 (A and B), extracellular RR is a potent, voltage-dependent blocker of wild type TRPV4. At a concentration of 1 μm, extracellular RR completely inhibited inward currents, whereas significant outward currents were measured at positive potentials more positive than +20 mV (Fig. 6, A and B). The apparent fraction of unblocked channels, measured from tail currents, increased from <0.05 at −100 mV to ∼0.8 at +80 mV, with 50% block at +60.8 ± 0.8 mV (n = 4; Fig. 6E). The rate of RR block was relatively fast, with a time constant for block of 0.9 ± 0.1 ms at −100 mV (n = 4). We also performed experiments in which a high concentration (50 μ M) of RR was included in the pipette solution. Under this condition, we did not observe inhibition of the TRPV4 current, whereas a subsequent addition of 1 μm RR to the extracellular medium resulted in the expected voltage-dependent block. These data establish that RR blocks TRPV4 from the extracellular side by binding in a voltage-dependent manner to a site in the channel pore, within the transmembrane electrical field. Virtually identical results were obtained for the D572A and K680A mutants (Fig.6E and data not shown). In contrast, the D682A and D672A/D862A mutants were much less sensitive to block by extracellular RR (Fig. 6, C and D, and data not shown), and the voltage dependence of the block was shifted to more negative potentials (Fig. 6E). For both mutants, the apparent fraction of unblocked channels increased from ∼0.15 at −100 mV to ∼1 at potentials >+40 mV (Fig. 6E), with 50% block at −21.0 ± 1.4 mV (n = 4) and −23.5 ± 2.5 mV (n = 3) for D672A/D682A and D682A, respectively. The rate of RR block was also much slower for these mutants, with time constants of 25.4 ± 1.3 ms (n = 4, D672A/D682A) and 24.7 ± 2.5 ms (n = 3, D682A). Thus, the negative side chain of Asp682 appears to be crucial for the high sensitivity of TRPV4 for RR, similar to Asp646 in the pore of TRPV1 (18Garcia-Martinez C. Morenilla-Palao C. Planells-Cases R. Merino J.M. Ferrer-Montiel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32552-32558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In recent years, the persistent discovery of new members within the TRP superfamily of cation channels has greatly advanced our understanding of Ca2+ influx mechanisms in many cell types. However, it is not always clear whether the ionic currents that are observed after expression of members of the TRP family are directly mediated by the TRP proteins themselves or whether they merely act as modulators of endogenous channels. The situation is further complicated by the findings that TRP proteins can form heteromultimers (19Strubing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) and/or reside in intracellular membranes (20Koulen P. Cai Y. Geng L. Maeda Y. Nishimura S. Witzgall R. Ehrlich B.E. Somlo S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The analysis of channel permeation properties and modulation of these properties by mutations to pore residues form the ultimate proof of the channel nature of these proteins. At present, this goal has only been achieved for TRPV1 and TRPV5 (11Nilius B. Vennekens R. Prenen J. Hoenderop J.G.J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J.M. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 13889-13894Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The present study adds another member of the TRPV family to this list, the osmosensitive and ligand-gated TRPV4. We have demonstrated that two negatively charged aspartate residues and the non-polar amino acid methionine are critical determinants of the pore properties of TRPV4. In the presence of both monovalent and divalent cations in the extracellular solution, the current-voltage relation of TRPV4 displays both inward and outward rectification, a feature it shares with TRPV1, TRPV2, and several members of the TRPM and TRPC families (22Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Our present results show that, at least for TRPV4, this behavior depends on extracellular Ca2+ ions, which both block the channel in a voltage-dependent manner and permeate the channel. We found that two negatively charged residues, Asp672 and Asp682, contribute to the channel’s Ca2+sensitivity, as evidenced by the reduced Ca2+-dependent rectification and ∼2-fold lower relative Ca2+ permeability in both the D672A and D682A mutants. The D672A/D682A double mutant displays an even stronger reduction in Ca2+-dependent rectification and Ca2+ permeability, indicating that the effect of neutralizing these aspartates on the Ca2+ sensitivity of TRPV4 is additive. Moreover, this double mutant has a very low selectivity for monovalent cations and a Cs+ ≈ Rb+ > K+ > Na+ > Li+permeability sequence, indicative of a very weak field binding site (Eisenman I or II). These results seem to indicate that these aspartates are fully equivalent and possibly contribute to a single negatively charged binding site for cations within the channel pore. However, both aspartates contribute differently to the voltage-dependent block of TRPV4 by the large polycation RR; the D672A mutant is blocked with the same affinity and voltage dependence as wild type by TRPV4, whereas block of the D682A or D672A/D682A mutants is strongly impaired. The potential for half-maximal block of these latter mutants by 1 μm RR is shifted to the left by ∼80 mV, and the rate of block at −100 mV is ∼25 times slower. Taken together, these results indicate that both aspartates contribute to the lining of the TRPV4 pore but differ in their accessibility to extracellular cations. Asp682 is positioned close to the outer mouth of the pore, where it can interact with both Ca2+ and RR. In contrast, Asp672 is likely to be located more toward the cytoplasmic site of the channel, because it can interact with the permeant cation Ca2+ but not with the bulky, impermeant cation RR. Our results also indicate that Met680 is crucial for the proper functioning of the TRPV4 pore. Substituting this residue with an alanine results in a decreased Ca2+ permeability and overall current amplitude. Introducing a negative charge at this position (mutant M680D) causes a further reduction of the current density and a complete loss of Ca2+ permeation. One possible explanation is that this additional negative charge enhances the affinity of the Ca2+-binding site to such an extent that it can no longer permeate the channel. We had hypothesized that neutralization of the positively charged lysine residue Lys675 could be involved in determining the field strength of the putative cation-binding site within the pore. This hypothesis originated from the fact that this residue is not present in the highly Ca2+-selective channels TRPV5 and 6. However, permeation properties for monovalent cations are not altered, and the relative Ca2+ permeability remains unchanged in the K675A mutant. Likewise, the two other mutants that were constructed to transfer the high Ca2+ selectivity and strong field binding site of TRPV5/6 onto TRPV4 (M680D and M680D/ΔK675) did not give the expected result and yielded channels with strongly reduced Ca2+ selectivity. It thus appears that the differences in pore properties between TRPV1/2/4 and TRPV5/6 cannot be reduced to single amino acid substitutions within the pore region. As shown in Fig. 1, the pore region of TRPV4 shows significant homology with the pore region of KcsA, the bacterial K+ channel whose crystal structure has been determined at 2.0 Å resolution (23Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar,24Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that both channels share a similar pore architecture. The results from our mutagenesis study are at least consistent with this hypothesis. Firstly, as discussed above, we concluded that Asp682 is located at the extracellular part of the TRPV4 pore where it can interact with RR, whereas Asp672 seems to be located more toward the cytoplasm. Indeed, in the KcsA structure, Asp80 (corresponding to Asp682 in TRPV4) is located at the outer mouth of the selectivity filter, whereas Glu71 (corresponding to Asp672) is directed more toward the intracellular side of the channel. Secondly, we found that Met680 is crucial for proper channel function, because mutating it to an alanine or aspartate strongly affects the permeability for monovalent and divalent cations. In the KcsA structure, the corresponding residue, Tyr78, is at the center of the selectivity filter, where its backbone oxygens interact with dehydrated K+ ions (23Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar, 24Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar). Finally, we concluded that the positively charged Lys675 does not significantly influence the pore properties of TRPV4. Interestingly, KcsA, like TRPV5/6, lacks a positive charge at the corresponding residue. However, if the structure homology between KcsA and TRPV4 holds true, Lys675 is expected to be part of the so-called pore helix (24Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar), the residues of which do not directly contribute to the lining of the channel pore. In conclusion, we have unambiguously shown that TRPV4 is a channel-forming protein that responds to mutations in its putative pore region with changes in ion permeability and block. Two negatively charged aspartates and a non-polar methionine residue were identified as critical determinants of the pore properties of the channel. Moreover, our results are compatible with the hypothesis that TRPV channels have the same basic pore architecture as K+channels, although further work, including a determination of the multimeric structure of the channel, may be needed to substantiate this notion. The present work may also form a starting point for future studies aimed at the unraveling of the exact gating mechanism or the discovery of more selective TRPV4 antagonists.

Capillary electrophoresis with fluorescence-labeled gliadin peptides was used to separate and quantify deamidated and transamidated products. In a competition assay, the affinity of TG2 to a set of overlapping γ-gliadin peptides was measured and compared with their recognition by celiac lesion T cells. Peptides differed considerably in their competition efficiency. Those peptides recognized by intestinal T cell lines showed marked competition indicating them as excellent substrates for TG2. The enzyme fine specificity of TG2 was characterized by synthetic peptide libraries and mass spectrometry. Residues in positions −1, +1, +2, and +3 relative to the targeted glutamine residue influenced the enzyme activity, and proline in position +2 had a particularly positive effect. The characterized sequence specificity of TG2 explained the variation between peptides as TG2 substrates indicating that the enzyme is involved in the selection of gluten T cell epitopes. The enzyme is mainly localized extracellularly in the small intestine where primary amines as substrates for the competing transamidation reaction are present. The deamidation could possibly take place in this compartment as an excess of primary amines did not completely inhibit deamidation of gluten peptides at pH 7.3. However, lowering of the pH decreased the reaction rate of the TG2-catalyzed transamidation, whereas the rate of the deamidation reaction was considerably increased. This suggests that the deamidation of gluten peptides by TG2 more likely takes place in slightly acidic environments.

The disease is precipitated by dietary wheat gluten and related proteins in barley and rye. The ingestion of such proteins induces mucosal lymphocyte infiltration and villus atrophy. Subjects with active disease have autoantibodies specific for the enzyme tissue transglutaminase (3Dieterich W. Ehnis T. Bauer M. Donner P. Volta U. Riecken E.O. Schuppan D. Nat.

Gluten-reactive CD4+ T cells isolated from the small intestine of CD patients are almost exclusively restricted by either of these HLA molecules (4Lundin K.E.A. Scott H. Hansen T. Paulsen G.

Interestingly, the gluten-reactive T cells of the celiac lesion predominantly recognize gluten peptides in which certain glutamines are converted to glutamic acid by deamidation (6Sjo¨stro¨m H.

TG2 is best known for its ability to catalyze an acyl transfer reaction in which the carboxamide group of a peptide-bound glutamine residue is the acyl donor and an appropriate primary amine is the acyl acceptor (10Folk J.E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 1-56PubMed Google Scholar). The active site of TG2 comprises a catalytic triad built by cysteine 277, histidine 335, and aspartic acid 358 (11Liu S. Cerione R.A. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2743-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In the first step, a glutamine residue forms a thiol ester with the active site cysteine, and ammonia is released (acylation). In the following rate-limiting transamidation step, the acyl group is transferred to the acyl acceptor amine forming an isopeptide bond (deacylation). However, the thiol ester bond can be also hydrolyzed, resulting in deamidation of the bound glutamine. In the literature the deamidation reaction is described to have a slower rate than the transamidation reaction (10Folk J.E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 1-56PubMed Google Scholar). To better understand how TG2 can be involved in formation of gluten T cell epitopes in CD, we have examined the affinity of various peptides to TG2, we have characterized the specificity of the enzyme, and we have studied the propensity of the enzyme to catalyze transamidation and deamidation reactions. We found that the affinity of various gliadin peptides to TG2 varies, and the peptides that stimulate T cells are among those with the highest affinity. The variation in affinity between the peptides can be explained by the fine specificity of the enzyme. The ratio of the deamidation to transamidation increased when pH was lowered beneath neutral pH. Our results suggest that the specificity of TG2 is involved in selection of gluten T cell epitopes and that the deamidation reaction of gluten peptides in celiac disease is taking place in slightly acidic environments. Synthetic peptides and peptide libraries were prepared by multiple solid-phase peptide synthesis on a robotic system (Syro MultiSynTech, Bochum, Germany) using Fmoc/O-t-butyl chemistry. Individual peptides were synthesized on 2-chlorotrityl resin (Senn Chemicals AG, Dielsdorf, Switzerland) as described previously (12Jung G. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1992; 31: 367-383Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar). For fluorescein labeling, carboxyfluorescein (3 eq, Sigma) was coupled to the free N-terminal amino group of the resin-bound, protected peptide using diisopropylcarbodiimide (5 eq) as coupling reagent. Identity of peptides was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry, and purity was analyzed by reversed phase-HPLC. Based on the sequence of the undecapeptide, TSEKSQTPLVT (13Pucci P. Malorni A. Marino G. Metafora S. Esposito C. Porta R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), 10 peptide libraries were synthesized on polystyrene A RAM amide resin (Rapp Polymere, Tu¨bingen, Germany). In each library one of the amino acid residues flanking the central glutamine was replaced by a randomized position (X), carrying all natural amino acids except cysteine. Randomized positions were introduced by double couplings with an equimolar mixture of 19 Fmoc-l-amino acids used in an equimolar ratio with respect to the coupling sites of the resin. Defined sequence positions were introduced using a 5-fold molar excess of single Fmoc-l-amino acids. An optimized synthesis and work-up protocol was used to obtain equimolar mixtures (14Wiesmu¨ller K.-H. Feiertag S. Fleckenstein B. Kienle S. Stoll D. Herrmann M. Jung G. Jung G. Combinatorial Peptide and Nonpeptide Libraries. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1996: 203-246Google Scholar) as analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry (15Metzger J.W. Kempter C. Wiesmu¨ller K.H. Jung G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 261-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The pepsin and trypsin digestion of crude gliadin and avenin was performed as described previously (8van de Wal Y. Kooy Y. van Veelen P. Pena S. Mearin L. Papadopoulos G. Koning F. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1585-1588PubMed Google Scholar). Human TG2 was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli using the vector construct as described previously (16Lai T.S. Slaughter T.F. Koropchak C.M. Haroon Z.A. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31191-31195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Guinea pig TG2 was obtained from Sigma. All analyses were done on a Beckman MDQ capillary electrophoresis system equipped with a laser-induced fluorescence detector (488 nm). CE was carried out in a fused-silica capillary (25-cm length, 75-μm inner diameter) equilibrated by three rinsing steps using 100 mm sodium hydroxide, water, and electrophoresis buffer (20 p.s.i., 1.5 min each). Samples were injected by pressure (0.5 p.s.i., 5 s), and separations were performed at 22 kV at room temperature. All samples were running from the cathode to the anode. Two forms of CE using different electrophoresis buffers were applied: standard capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) runs were done with 80 mm sodium borate, pH 9.3; for micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) 64 mm sodium borate, 20 mm sodium dodecylsulfate, pH 9.3 was used. The fluorescein-labeled peptide QLQPFPQPQLPY (defined as F-αI, corresponding to α9-gliadin-(57–68)), its deamidated derivative α9-(57–68)E65 (defined as F-αIE), and the F-αI-TG2 complex were separated and quantified by MEKC. The transamidation product of F-αI, which is obtained by using 5-biotinylpentylamine (5-BP) as an acyl acceptor, is defined as F-αI5BP. F-αI and F-αIE were separated from F-αI5BP by CZE. F-αI was incubated at the concentrations indicated with 1 μm TG2 at 37 °C in 100 mm Tris/Cl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.3 except in experiments in which the effect of pH was investigated. In competition assays different amounts of single unlabeled competitor peptides or peptic-tryptic digests of gliadin or avenin were added, and incubation was done for 18 min. To quantify deamidationversus transamidation, 5-BP was titrated as a primary amine, and samples were incubated for different time periods. In case of CZE, samples were diluted at least 1:33 by 100 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA. For MEKC, samples were diluted by 64 mm sodium borate, 20 mm SDS, pH 9.3. It was shown that under both conditions the enzymatic activity of TG2 was shut off immediately. Peptide libraries (1 mm) and 5-BP were incubated with 0.1 μm TG2 (guinea pig enzyme, Sigma) in 100 mmTris/Cl, pH 7.5 at 37 °C (1 mm 5-BP, 2 h; 0.5 mm 5-BP, 1 h; 100-μl total volume). Samples were desalted by solid-phase extraction using C18 ZipTip (Millipore GmbH, Eschborn, Germany) and analyzed by direct infusion ESI-FTICR mass spectrometry on a passively shielded 4.7-T APEXII ESI-MALDI-FTICR mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany). The software XMASS version 5.0.10 (Bruker Daltonik) was used for data acquisition and processing. All samples were diluted in a solution of 1% acetic acid in acetonitrile/water (50/50). ESI (Analytica of Branford, Branford, CT) was performed in the positive ion mode with a grounded capillary sprayer needle mounted 60° off-axis. No supporting nebulizer gas was used, and the flow rate was 1 μl/min. Transamidated reaction products were identified by their typical mass shift of +311.2 atomic mass units (+155.6 atomic mass units for doubly charged peptides) compared with the original peptides in the library. In each spectrum, the peak intensities of the converted products were divided by those of the corresponding unconverted peptides in the same sample to compensate for differences in ionization behavior and the partial lack of exact equimolar presentation between different peptides in the library. These ratios were defined as the “transamidation rate.” Gluten-reactive T cells were generated from intestinal biopsies of treated adult celiac disease patients as described elsewhere (9Molberg Ø. McAdam S. Lundin K.E.A. Kristiansen C. Arentz-Hansen H. Kett K. Sollid L.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1317-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The establishment of the T cell clones 380 E2, 387 E9, and 430.1.142 specific for the DQ2-α-I (α9-(57–68)E65) epitope has been described previously (17Arentz-Hansen H. Ko¨rner R. Molberg Ø. Quarsten H. Vader W. Kooy Y.M. Lundin K.E.A. Koning F. Roepstorff P. Sollid L.M. McAdam S.N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). T cell proliferation assays were done as described previously (9Molberg Ø. McAdam S. Lundin K.E.A. Kristiansen C. Arentz-Hansen H. Kett K. Sollid L.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1317-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) using an HLA-matched Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell line (irradiated 80 grays) as antigen-presenting cells. The synthetic peptides F-αI and F-αIE were used to work out separation conditions by CZE. The deamidated peptide, which carries an extra negative charge, was base-line separated from F-αI and eluted 0.85 min later. Moreover, the formation of F-αIE by incubation of F-αI with TG2 was demonstrated by CZE (data not shown). However, as we were also interested in separating and quantifying covalent F-αI-TG2 complexes (not discussed in this paper), we changed to MEKC, which allowed us to separate F-αI, the enzymatic deamidation product F-αIE, and F-αI-TG2 complexes (Fig. 1,A and B). The identity of F-αIE and F-αI-TG2 complexes was confirmed by adding the synthetic peptide and a chemically labeled fluorescein isothiocyanate-TG2 adduct, respectively. The second product observed in Fig. 1B is most probably a double deamidated derivative, defined as F-αIEE. Incubation of F-αI with TG2 in the presence of 5-BP led to the expected transamidation product F-αI5BP, which was separated from F-αI and deamidated products only by CZE (Fig. 1C). The identity of the obtained signals was proven by adding streptavidin-coated beads (Dynal). The major reaction product and a minor by-product were specifically removed, identifying them as F-αI5BP and a double transamidated derivative F-αI2×5BP. The quantification of TG2-catalyzed deamidation products by MEKC and the use of the fluorescence-labeled substrate F-αI was first validated by measuring the deamidation of F-αI by TG2 in 100 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.3, 2 mm Ca2+. Plotting the reaction velocityV versus [F-αI] revealed akcat of 21 min−1 and aKm of 0.17 mm, resulting in akcat/Km of 124 min−1 mm−1. Compared with the parameters obtained in a recent study for the non-labeled peptide (kcat = 23 min−1,Km = 0.35 mm) (18Piper J.L. Gray G.M. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), our measuredKm value is slightly lower, whereaskcat values are identical. The observedkcat/Km value is still in the order as expected and may partly reflect the fluorescence labeling of the peptide and different buffers used in both studies. For a further validation of the CE-based analysis, single unlabeled α- and γ-gliadin peptides were used to compete with the deamidation of F-αI. These peptides are known as substrates of TG2 as they are converted to T cell epitopes by specific deamidation of glutamine residues. The deamidated reaction product F-αIE was quantified by MEKC, and by comparing results with and without competitors we calculated the competition efficiency over a broad concentration range. The calculated IC50 values obtained from these titration experiments ranged from 50 μm (for DQ2-α-II) to 235 μm (for DQ2-α-I) (Fig.2). As controls, three peptides from ovalbumin, from hen egg lysozyme, and from the mouse λ-light chain (λ2(315)-(89–107)A90) were used. These peptides have not been described as substrates of TG2 and carry only one (ovalbumin and hen egg lysozyme peptide) or no (λ-light chain peptide) glutamine residues. For all three peptides only a weak competition ≤15% was observed at the highest competitor concentration used (550 μm), and IC50 values were estimated to be significantly higher than 550 μm. The established competition assay and the validated CE analysis was used to measure competition of a set of 23 20-mer peptides overlapping by 10 residues and covering nearly the complete sequence of the γ-gliadin M36999 (19Scheets K. Hedgcoth C. Plant Sci. 1988; 57: 141-150Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Osman A.A. Gunnel T. Dietl A. Uhlig H.H. Amin M. Fleckenstein B. Richter T. Mothes T. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 121: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). F-αI was used as reporter peptide, and its deamidation by TG2 was quantified by MEKC. To limit the number of assays and CE runs, competition of each peptide was measured at a single concentration of 110 μm, a concentration where the titration curves obtained for the gliadin peptides showed the highest slope. The γ-gliadin peptides showed significant differences in their competition potency ranging from 73% (M13) to 9% (M4) (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, a sequence region (M36999 residues 61–140) was identified in which all peptides showed competitions >56% (M7–M13). The same set of 20-mer peptides was screened for recognition after TG2 treatment by six gluten-specific, polyclonal intestinal T cell lines generated from six different celiac disease patients, and the results are reported in detail elsewhere (21Arentz-Hansen, H., McAdam, S. N., Molberg, Ø., Fleckenstein, B., Lundin, K. E. A., Jo¨rgensen, T. J. D., Jung, G., Roepstorff, P., and Sollid, L. M. (2002)Gastroenterology, in pressGoogle Scholar). Although these T cell lines recognized different numbers of peptides (from one to six) and varied in their response to the recognized peptides, the six T cell lines together recognized eight of the 23 γ-gliadin peptides: M2, M7, M8, M10, M12, M13, M23, and M24 (Fig. 3A). With the exception of M23 (46% competition), all these peptides showed competition higher than 58%, and five reside in the region M36999 (residues 61–140). Subsequently, more heterogeneous mixtures, as a peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin and avenin, and the known protein substrate N,N-dimethylcasein (22Slaughter T.F. Achyuthan K.E. Lai T.S. Greenberg C.S. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) were used as competitors. From these titration experiments (using 10 μm F-αI) IC50 values of 94 and 210 μg/ml were obtained for the peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin andN,N-dimethylcasein, respectively. For the peptic-tryptic digest of avenin, an IC50 of at least 2000 μg/ml was estimated. The undecapeptide TSEKSQTPLVT is an acyl donor substrate for TG2 (13Pucci P. Malorni A. Marino G. Metafora S. Esposito C. Porta R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Ten peptide libraries randomized in positions −5 to −1 and +1 to +5 with respect to the central glutamine targeted by TG2 (TableI) were applied in transamidation assays using guinea pig TG2 and 5-BP as a primary amine. Transamidated reaction products were identified by ESI-FTICR mass spectrometry, and “transamidation rates” were determined.Table ISubstrate specificity of guinea pig TG2Peptide libraryPositionInfluence of aa in position X on the transamidation of Gln (Q)+ ++±− −XSEKSQTPLVT−5All1-aAll 19 amino acids present in the X position.TXEKSQTPLVT−4All1-aAll 19 amino acids present in the X position.TSXKSQTPLVT−3All1-aAll 19 amino acids present in the X position.TSEXSQTPLVT−2All1-aAll 19 amino acids present in the X position.TSEKXQTPLVT−1FYWSAGQNTVPDILMEHKRTSEKSQXPLVT+1RKHYWFILVQASTEDNMGPTSEKSQTXLVT+2PWYFVALMIQHSTNGDEKRTSEKSQTPXVT+3ILVFYWTSMNQADEHKRGPTSEKSQTPLXT+4All1-aAll 19 amino acids present in the X position.TSEKSQTPLVX+5All1-aAll 19 amino acids present in the X position.Synthetic peptide libraries were used in a transamidation assay, and the reaction products were characterized by semiquantitative FTICR mass spectrometry.

Positions −5 to +5 indicate the distance between theX position and the targeted glutamine residue (Q). The same notation is given on the x axis of Fig. 4. aa, amino acids. These experiments allowed us to assess semiquantitatively the influence of all 19 amino acid residues in the 10 randomized sequence positions on TG2-catalyzed transamidation as summarized in Table I. In positions −5, −4, −3, −2, +4, and +5, all amino acids were more or less equally well accepted by TG2 as all 19 peptides in these libraries were found to be transamidated in similar amounts. In all other positions, amino acid residues influenced the observed transamidation rate. The most pronounced effect was observed for proline: in position +2, proline showed by far the most supportive effect, and the transamidated peptide TSEKSQTPLVT represented almost 40% of all reaction products. Furthermore, hydrophobic residues were tolerated more than hydrophilic side chains. A completely opposite result was found for positions +1 and +3, where proline, and also glycine, quantitatively abolished transamidation. Almost all other residues were tolerated in position +1, whereas in position +3 mainly hydrophobic amino acids were preferred compared with hydrophilic and charged residues. Although no amino acid showed a pronounced effect in position −1, different residues induced different transamidation rates, and charged side chains decreased transamidation. The variance of all transamidation rates found for the 19 amino acids in an Xposition describes its impact on the sequence specificity of TG2. Thus, for the investigated undecapeptide, positions +2 and +3 were found as most important followed by positions −1 and +1 (Fig.4). The data above strongly suggest that the spacing between the targeted glutamine and C-terminal proline residues dominates the specificity of TG2, i.e. QxP (where x, representing a variable amino acid, indicates the distance between Gln and Pro) strongly supports transamidation, whereas QP and QxxP abolish it (Table I). These motifs were used to predict targeted glutamine residues within the γ-gliadin peptides to explain their competition data (Fig. 3A). Glutamines within QP or QxxP were predicted as not targeted. Glutamines that are part of the QxP motif were predicted as targets, and a value of 1 was assigned to such peptides. Sequences containing QxPP or QPPx were not found in these peptides. Glutamines, which are not followed by proline in positions +1, +2, or +3, were predicted as moderately targeted if at least three residues in positions −1, +1, +2, or +3 matched those listed under “+” in Table I. If so, a value of 0.5 was assigned to such peptides. The sum of the values assigned to a given peptide would then reflect the number of predicted glutamine residues that can be targeted by TG2. We found that the prediction correlated with the competition data of the overlapping γ-gliadin peptides (Fig. 3B). Especially for peptides M7–M13, prediction scores ≥2.5 were obtained that correlated with competition values >56%. Also, competition of C-terminal peptides M22–M24 (≥45%) was predicted, although smaller scores were obtained for these peptides. In contrast, for peptides M1 and M6 prediction scores of 2.5 and 3.0 were found, respectively, but both showed only moderate competition. Using CZE, both TG2-catalyzed deamidation and transamidation of F-αI were quantified in the presence of 5-BP as a primary amine (Fig. 1C). Incubation of 10 μm F-αI with increasing amounts of 5-BP for 2 h resulted, as expected, in an increase of the transamidated and a decrease of the deamidated product (Fig.5A). Notably, at an equimolar ratio between F-αI and 5-BP, deamidation was still superior to transamidation. Both reaction rates became similar at about 50 μm 5-BP. However, significant deamidation of F-αI was measured even at a 20- and 40-fold excess of 5-BP compared with F-αI. The amount of remaining F-αI (about 0.5 μm) was independent of the 5-BP concentration. Increasing the F-αI concentration at a fixed 5-BP concentration resulted in higher amounts of F-αIE (Fig. 5B). At equimolar conditions (5, 10, 50, and 200 μm F-αI and 5-BP), 2.0, 4.0, 14.5, and 19.5 μm F-αIE was measured showing a decrease in the relative amount of F-αIEwith increased substrate concentrations (40, 40, 29, and 9.8%). Nevertheless, an excess of 5-BP of 80-fold (for 5 μmF-αI), 40-fold (for 10 μm F-αI), 10-fold (for 50 μm F-αI), or 5-fold (for 200 μm F-αI) still resulted in significant generation of deamidated peptide. However, no deamidation was measured for 50 μm F-αI and 1000 μm 5-BP. The data obtained from CZE were complemented with functional assays using three DQ2-restricted intestinal T cell clones (TCCs) specific for the DQ2-αIE-epitope. These TCCs are highly specific for the deamidated peptide; they do not recognize the native α9-(57–68) peptide or its transamidated derivative. In control experiments, we found that these TCCs recognized the free (DQ2-αIE) and labeled peptides (F-αIE) with similar sensitivity (data not shown). As shown for a representative TCC, the T cell proliferation was not significantly different in samples of 10 μm F-αI tested after incubation with TG2 in the presence of no or 10 μm 5-BP (Fig. 6). However, decreased proliferation was observed in the presence of higher concentrations of 5-BP (50 and 400 μm). Even at a 40-fold excess of 5-BP compared with F-αI, proliferation of the three TCCs clearly exceeded that measured for the background (incubation of 10 μm F-αI without TG2). TG2 was incubated with F-αI and 5-BP in 100 mm Tris/Cl, 2 mm Ca2+ at various pH values ranging from 7.5 to 5.5. Separation and quantification of the deamidated (F-αIE) and transamidated reaction product (F-αI5BP) by CZE showed that the ratio of the deamidation to transamidation reaction rates is influenced by pH (Fig.7). Lowering of the pH resulted in decreased formation of F-αI5BP and increased formation of F-αIE. Determination of initial transamidation and deamidation reaction rates showed almost a bisection of the transamidation rate when pH was lowered from pH 7.5 to pH 6.0 (Fig.8A). In parallel, however, the deamidation rate rose 10-fold, reaching nearly the velocity of transamidation. Furthermore, initial transamidation rates were compared with deamidation rates determined in the absence of 5-BP. In this case the deamidation rate stayed constant for both pH values (Fig.8B).Figure 8Initial reaction rates of the transamidation and deamidation reactions at pH 7.5 and pH 6.0. F-αI (50 μm) and human TG2 (1 μm) were incubated with 5-BP (200 μm,black bars) or without 5-BP (open bars) in 100 mm Tris/Cl, 2 mmCaCl2 at 37 °C. Formation of deamidated and transamidated reaction products at different time points was quantified by CZE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The majority of T cells of the celiac small intestinal lesion recognize deamidated gluten peptides. This study provides details as to how the enzyme TG2 is responsible for this deamidation and demonstrates that the enzyme is directly involved in the selection of gluten T cell epitopes. Moreover, our results reveal that TG2-catalyzed gluten deamidation could possibly occur extracellularly as an excess of primary amines did not completely inhibit deamidation at pH 7.3. However, the deamidation is more likely to take place in a slightly acidic environment. Lowering of the pH resulted in a dramatic increase in the ratio of deamidated to transamidated products formed in the presence of primary amines. Deamidation of a glutamine side chain adds a negative charge to the peptide. Capillary electrophoresis, which separates mainly according to charge, functioned well for fast separation and quantification of educt and deamidated and transamidated reaction products. All reaction products of a fluorescein-labeled reporter peptide could be detected with high specificity and sensitivity with laser-induced fluorescence detection also in competition assays. This was especially relevant when heterogeneous competitor samples, like peptic-tryptic digests of gliadin or avenin, were used. Interestingly, the peptic-tryptic digest of avenin was found to be a much poorer substrate for TG2 than the peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin. This is likely related to the different toxicities of the two cereal proteins for celiac patients (23Janatuinen E.K. Kemppainen T.A. Pikkarainen P.H. Holm K.H. Kosma V.M. Uusitupa M.I. Ma¨ki M. Julkunen R.J. Gut. 2000; 46: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A similar conclusion was recently reached in a study by Vader et al. (24Vader L.W. de Ru A. van der Wal Y. Kooy Y.M. Benckhuijsen W. Mearin M.L. Drijfhout J.W. van Veelen P. Koning F. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We addressed the question of whether TG2 is involved in the selection of gliadin-derived T cell epitopes. We measured the competition of a set of overlapping γ-gliadin peptides and compared these data with the recognition of the same peptides by intestinal T cell lines generated from CD patients. We also determined the specificity of TG2. The latter was analyzed by means of peptide libraries and mass spectrometry using guinea pig TG2 in a transamidation assay with 5-BP. Transamidated reaction products differ in mass from their educts by +311.2 atomic mass units, compared with +1 atomic mass unit for the deamidation reaction, and were therefore easier to identify when a peptide library was used as an educt. As the acyl donor substrate (glutamine-containing peptide) is bound to the enzyme prior to the primary amine, sequence specificity should be identical in the deamidation and transamidation reactions. The spacing between the targeted glutamine and proline in the C-terminal positions +1,+2, and +3 played a dominating role in the specificity of TG2. Our data (i.e. TG2 preferred mostly QxP but not QP or QxxP) are in accordance with a previous report on specificity of guinea pig TG2 where deamidation within synthetic substitution analogs of gliadin peptides was analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (24Vader L.W. de Ru A. van der Wal Y. Kooy Y.M. Benckhuijsen W. Mearin M.L. Drijfhout J.W. van Veelen P. Koning F. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Unlike the previous report, we also found an influence of residues in position −1. The determined sequence specificity of TG2 nicely explains the variation in competition observed between the overlapping γ-gliadin peptides. Although these experiments do not directly prove the deamidation within these peptides, eight peptides were recognized after TG2 treatment by the T cell lines indicating that they indeed undergo TG2-catalyzed deamidation. Notably, these peptides were among those with the highest competition values signifying them as excellent substrates of TG2. From these results it can be concluded that TG2 itself is participating in epitope selection in CD. At pH 7.3, TG2-mediated deamidation did occur even at an excess of primary amines (5-BP). In the small intestine, TG2 is predominantly expressed extracellularly in the subepithelial region just beneath the basal membrane (7Molberg Ø. McAdam S.N. Ko¨rner R. Quarsten H. Kristiansen C. Madsen L. Fugger L. Scott H. Noren O. Roepstorff P. Lundin K.E.A. Sjo¨stro¨m H. Sollid L.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar) where the pH is likely around 7.3 and a variety of primary amines competing for the transamidation reaction are present. Our data indicate that DQ2-restricted T cell epitopes can be formed by TG2-catalyzed deamidation in this extracellular compartment in vivo. However, the ratio of deamidated to transamidated products was significantly increased when pH was lowered from 7.3. This suggests that deamidation in the gut is likely to occur in compartments with a slightly acidic pH. Apart from its extracellular expression, TG2 is also expressed in the epithelial cells including the brush border (7Molberg Ø. McAdam S.N. Ko¨rner R. Quarsten H. Kristiansen C. Madsen L. Fugger L. Scott H. Noren O. Roepstorff P. Lundin K.E.A. Sjo¨stro¨m H. Sollid L.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). The pH in the proximal small intestine is about pH 6.6 (25Evans D.F. Pye G. Bramley R. Clark A.G. Dyson T.J. Hardcastle J.D. Gut. 1988; 29: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar), which should allow a predominant deamidation of peptides in the brush border. Another possibility is that TG2 is endocytosed and is active during the initial pH decrease in early endosomes. This could be by endocytosis of surface immunoglobulin by TG2-specific B cells (26Sollid L.M. Molberg Ø. McAdam S. Lundin K.E.A. Gut. 1997; 41: 851-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) or by endocytosis of TG2 expressed in the surface membranes of macrophages and dendritic cells (27Murtaugh M.P. Arend W.P. Davies P.J. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 159: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 28Le Naour F. Hohenkirk L. Grolleau A. Misek D.E. Lescure P. Geiger J.D. Hanash S. Beretta L. J. Biol.

A substantial fraction of the active site of TG2 may be occupied by gluten peptides in the gut (18Piper J.L. Gray G.M. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and co-internalized free gluten peptides also could be subjected to deamidation. Our data demonstrate that the rates of the transamidation and deamidation reactions are dramatically changed over a narrow pH range (from pH 6.0 to pH 7.3). The results resemble titration curves of an acid/base pair around a given pKa value. To allow the nucleophilic attack on the thiol ester intermediate, the amine must be unprotonated. As the pKa of lysine and 5-BP is around 10.5, slight pH changes in the range we observed would not lead to significant alteration in the ratio of their protonated and unprotonated ε-amino group as suggested in an earlier study to explain the decreased transamidation at low pH (31Mycek M.J. Waelsch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 3513-3517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rather we propose a general base-catalyzed deacylation mechanism for the transamidation reaction (32Leblanc A. Gravel C. Labelle J. Keillor J.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8335-8342Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A basic amino acid in TG2 (possibly histidine 335 of the catalytic triad) removes a proton from the amine substrate during the rate-limiting deacylation step. Notably, the pKa of the imidazole group of a histidine in active sites of enzymes is in the range where we observed the pH effect on the transamidation reaction (33Liu T. Ryan M. Dahlquist F.W. Griffith O.H. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1937-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Lowering of the pH below the pKa of this base would increase its protonation. Consequently the competing nucleophilic attack by water molecules is favored, explaining the increased deamidation rate. As the concentration of water molecules is pH-independent, deamidation in the absence of primary amines is not influenced by a pH shift. Our data strongly suppose that TG2 is involved in the selection of epitopes recognized by T cells of the intestinal celiac lesion and indicate that TG2-catalyzed deamidation occurs in a slightly acidic environment. To define exactly where this is in the intestinal mucosa should be the focus of further studies. Detailed insight into the cell biology and biochemistry of this process may lead to the identification of new targets for therapy in CD. We thank Profs.

It cycles between the bloodstream of a mammalian host and the digestive tract of the tsetse fly. During transmission, T. bruceidifferentiates into different life cycle stages characterized by distinct morphologies, surface proteins, and energy metabolisms. The energy metabolism of the long slender bloodstream forms in the vertebrate host is based on glycolysis, which is localized in a specialized organelle, called the glycosome. Long slender bloodstream forms have a mitochondrion whose volume is much reduced when compared with the one in the other life cycle stages. Furthermore, since the cytochromes and many citric acid cycle enzymes are missing, it is not capable of performing oxidative phosphorylation (1Clayton C.E. Michels P. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 465-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 2Tielens A.G.M. VanHellemond J.J. Parasitol. Today. 1998; 14: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The procyclic form in the midgut of the fly, on the other hand, is characterized by a large mitochondrion. It has a complete citric acid cycle and a fully functional respiratory chain (3Durieux P.O. Schutz P. Brun R. Kohler P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Energy production in procyclic cells is mainly based on the mitochondrion. There are three partially overlapping pathways in which ATP can be produced (indicated as types I–III in Fig.1, as discussed below). In type I, as in mitochondria from other organisms, ATP is produced by oxidative phosphorylation in a cyanide-sensitive electron transport chain. The main mitochondrial respiratory substrate appears to be succinate (4Turrens J.F. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Succinate is oxidized by succinate dehydrogenase (SDH),1 which transfers the electrons to the cytochrome bc1 complex via the lipid soluble electron carrier ubiquinone. The presence of a functional NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase has also been reported (5Beattie D.S. Howton M.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 6Fang J. Wang Y. Beattie D.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 2001: 3075-3082Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar); however, to what extent this complex is involved in ATP production is a matter of debate (7Turrens J. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 346-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In type II, as expected, one step of substrate-level phosphorylation catalyzed by succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCoAS) occurs in the citric acid cycle. In higher eukaryotes, it is GTP that is synthesized at this step, whereas the T. brucei enzyme directly produces ATP. In type III, finally, mitochondrial ATP can be produced anaerobically by substrate level phosphorylation coupled to acetate formation using the as yet poorly characterized acetate:succinate CoA transferase/SCoAS cycle (ASCT cycle) (8vanHellemond J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Tielens A.G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3036-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This pathway consists of two enzymes, the acetate:succinate CoA transferase, which is responsible for transferring the CoA from acetyl-CoA to succinate, and a SCoAS activity, which conserves the energy in the thioester bond of succinyl-CoA. Occurrence of the ASCT cycle in mitochondria is very restricted; it has only been found in trypanosomatid and some parasitic helminths (8vanHellemond J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Tielens A.G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3036-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, the ASCT cycle is also found in the hydrogenosome of trichomonads and some fungi. Hydrogenosomes are double membrane-bounded organelles involved in pyruvate degradation. They do not perform oxidative phosphorylation and do not have their own genome (9Dyall S. Johnson P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, morphological and molecular data suggest that mitochondria and hydrogenosomes are related. T. bruceibelongs to the earliest branching eukaryotes that have mitochondria (10Sogin M.L. Elwood H.J. Gunderson J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1383-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The fact that they share the ASCT cycle with hydrogenosomes therefore supports a common evolutionary origin for both organelles. In this study, we have established a system that allows the separate analysis of the three mitochondrial ATP production pathways in procyclic T. brucei by measuring ATP production in anin organello system in response to different substrates and a panel of specific inhibitors. Furthermore, RNA interference (RNAi)-induced ablation of key enzymes of each pathway was used to determine their relative importance for the survival of cultured procyclic T. brucei cells. Procyclic T. brucei, stock 427, was grown at 27 °C in SDM-79 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were harvested at 3.5–4.5 × 107 cells/ml. Procyclic T. brucei, strain 29-13, on which the RNAi knock-down cell lines are based, was grown in SDM-79 (11Brun R. Scho¨nenberger M. Acta Tropica. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml hygromycine, and 15 μg/ml G-418, and it was harvested at a density of 0.5–2 × 107 cells/ml. Mitochondria of T. brucei 427 used for the in organello ATP production assays shown in Fig. 2 were isolated under isotonic conditions (12Hauser R. Pypaert M. Ha¨usler T. Horn E.K. Schneider A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 517-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in a mitochondrial preparation having intact outer and inner membranes (13Allemann N. Schneider A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The final fraction of mitochondria was resuspended at 30–50 mg of protein/ml in SoTE (0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 2 mm EDTA) containing 20 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and frozen in aliquots. Mitochondria used for in organello ATP production assays from the RNAi knock-down cell lines were prepared by digitonin extraction as described (14Tan T.H.P. Pach R. Crausaz A. Ivens A. Schneider A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3707-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The resulting mitochondrial pellet (108 cell equivalents each) was resupended in 750 μl of the buffer used for the in organello ATP production assays. ATP production assays were done as described (13Allemann N. Schneider A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For each sample, 50–100 μg of isotonically purified mitochondrial fractions or 107 cell equivalents of the digitonin-extracted samples were used. To induce ATP production, 5 mm of the indicated substrates (succinate, α-ketoglutarate, or pyruvate/succinate) and 67 μm ADP was added. After incubation at 25 °C for 30 min, the reaction was processed, and the ATP concentration was determined as described. Inhibitors were preincubated with mitochondria for 10 min on ice and used at the following final concentrations: atractyloside (33.3 μg/ml), malonate (6.7 mm), antimycin (2.7 μm). ATP production was then induced by the addition of substrate and ADP. The T. brucei databases (obtained from The Sanger Institute web site at www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/T_brucei) was analyzed with the BLAST software using default parameter settings to search for the genes for SDH, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KDH), SCoAS, and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) by homology to the corresponding genes in other organisms (Table I). Fragments corresponding to the 5′-part of the coding region of the flavoprotein subunit of the SDH and the E1 subunit of the KDH gene were amplified using 5′- and 3′-primers having flanking XhoI andHindIII sites, respectively. The resulting fragments were cloned into the corresponding restriction sites of the pZJM vector, which contains opposing T7 RNA polymerase promoters (15Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The RNAi constructs for the β subunit of SCoAS and the E1 α-subunit of PDH were based on pLew100. pLew100 was modified by replacing theHindIII/BamHI fragment with a fragment corresponding to 690 nucleotides of the trypanosomal spliced leader sequence. The inserted fragment carries adjacentHindIII/XbaI sites at its 5′-end and adjacentXhoI/BamH sites at its 3′-end. Essentially the vector represents a version of the previously described stem loop construct carrying convenient cloning sites (15Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Fragments corresponding to the 5′-part of the coding region of the SCoAS and PDH genes were amplified using 5′-primers carrying flankingBamHI/HindIII sites and 3′-primers carryingXbaI/XhoI sites. The PCR fragments from the two genes were then digested with HindIII/XbaI and inserted into the corresponding sites of the modified stem loop vector. The resulting plasmids, carrying one gene fragment each, as well as the original PCR fragments, were then digested byBamHI/XhoI, allowing insertion of the same gene fragments in the opposite direction.Table IOligonucleotides used for the construction of the RNAi-plasmidsEnzymeSubunitGenBank™ accession numbers1-aSequencing of the T. brucei genome was performed by the following sequencing centers: Sanger Centre and The Institute of Genomic Research (TIGR).Oligonucleotides1-b5′- and 3′-primers used for the amplification of the inserts in the corresponding RNAi constructs are shown.SDHFlavoproteinAQ659505gaggtatcaacgctgctcAL496599.1gctttcggagcataccgcKDHE1AQ657187gagaaactgtgggtgtggAQ656461cttgcccagcaaaagcagSCoASβAQ659061cttcccacgaaggctgcgAQ655451agcattttcagcggcgcgPDHE1 αAQ953618gcttaagtgtgtcagccgtcgagggcatagcgccac1-a Sequencing of the T. brucei genome was performed by the following sequencing centers: Sanger Centre and The Institute of Genomic Research (TIGR).1-b 5′- and 3′-primers used for the amplification of the inserts in the corresponding RNAi constructs are shown.

It was shown previously that isolated mitochondria are depleted of nucleotides as well as of endogenous substrates (13Allemann N. Schneider A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Addition of ADP is therefore required forin organello ATP production, irrespective of which substrate is being used. Treatment of mitochondria with atractyloside, a specific inhibitor of the ADP/ATP translocator, blocks import of ADP and therefore provides a simple way to test whether an observed ATP production is indeed mitochondrial. The use of malonate, a competitive inhibitor of SDH, and antimycine, which inhibits the cytochromebc1 complex, permits us to determine which fraction of an observed ATP production is due to oxidative phosphorylation (13Allemann N. Schneider A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the nature of the ATP production in isolated mitochondria induced by succinate, α−ketoglutarate, and pyruvate, the three substrates that have been used throughout this study. As shown previously, succinate induces an ATP production that is completely abolished in the presence of malonate or antimycine and therefore is entirely due to oxidative phosphorylation (type I) (13Allemann N. Schneider A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Addition of α−ketoglutarate, on the other hand, leads to an ATP production essentially due to substrate level phosphorylation occurring in the citric acid cycle and catalyzed by SCoAS (type II). The low but statistically significant amount of ATP synthesis that is inhibited by malonate and antimycine (∼20%) is due to the produced succinate that is fed into the respiratory chain. No ATP production was measured in the presence of pyruvate alone. This was surprising since pyruvate is expected to be metabolized to acetyl-CoA, which can be used by the citric acid as well as by the ASCT cycle. A possible explanation for these results is that co-substrates were missing. Indeed, when the pyruvate-containing reaction was supplemented with succinate, ATP production could be induced. Approximately 68% of the observed production was malonate- and antimycine-insensitive and therefore caused by substrate level phosphorylation most likely linked to the ASCT cycle (type III). The remaining ∼32% are due to succinate alone giving its electrons to the respiratory chain. A small amount of ATP production (∼20% of the pyruvate succinate combination) was also observed when pyruvate was combined with either malate or fumarate, indicating that pyruvate can also enter the citric acid cycle (not shown). Comparing the absolute values of ATP production (Fig. 2B), it is clear that more ATP is synthesized in response to α−ketoglutarate and pyruvate/succinate, which induce mainly substrate level phosphorylation (type II and III), than to succinate alone, which induces oxidative phosphorylation only (type I). However, the amounts of ATP produced by substrate level phosphorylation cannot directly be compared with the amounts produced by oxidative phosphorylation, for the following reason. During the mitochondrial isolation procedure, fragmentation of the large procyclic mitochondria cannot be avoided. The resulting mitochondrial vesicles reseal, but the membranes may still be more leaky to protons than in vivo, resulting in an underestimation of the ATP that can be produced by oxidative phosphorylation within the intact cell. RNAi is a recently discovered process in which the presence of a double-stranded RNA in a cell causes specific degradation of the corresponding mRNA in a variety of organisms. RNAi was shown to be a powerful method for the inhibition of gene expression in T. brucei (15Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 17Shi H. Djikeng A. Mark T. Wirtz E. Tschudi C. Ullu E. RNA (N.

A. 1998; 95: 14687-14692Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Therefore, to dissect the different ATP production pathways and to determine their relative importance for procyclic T. brucei, we established tetracycline-inducible (19Wirtz E. Clayton C. Science. 1995; 268: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) RNAi cell lines that have reduced amounts of SDH, KDH, SCoAS, and PDH. Subsequently, all cell lines were analyzed for a growth phenotype in SDM 79 medium (11Brun R. Scho¨nenberger M. Acta Tropica. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar) and for the presence of the three mitochondrial ATP production pathways described in the Introduction. For all experiments, two sets of controls were performed: 1) All biochemical assays were done in parallel with mitochondria isolated from cells uninduced and induced for the expression of double-stranded RNA. It is expected that in all experiments, mitochondria from uninduced cells should behave like the ones from wild-type T. brucei shown in Fig. 2. This was indeed the case since the results of the in organello ATP assays performed with cells grown in the absence of tetracycline were essentially identical for all cell lines and substrates tested (Fig. 3, left sides of the bar diagrams). 2) For each of the four cell lines, the ATP production pathways expected not to be affected by the RNAi knock-down effect were used as positive controls (Fig. 3,CONTROL) to show the integrity of the mitochondria. SDH links the citric acid cycle to the respiratory chain. A RNAi knock-down of the flavoprotein subunit of SDH results in an essentially complete loss of oxidative phosphorylation in response to succinate (Fig. 3A). Substrate level phosphorylation induced by either α-ketoglutarate or pyruvate/succinate, however, was not affected. Interestingly, despite the severe biochemical phenotype, no effect on growth was observed. The KDH complex converts α-ketoglutarate into succinyl-CoA. RNAi-induced ablation of the E1 subunit of KDH selectively affects the substrate level phosphorylation occurring in the citric acid cycle (Fig. 3B). As expected, oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production in the ASCT cycle were not affected. Similarly to SDH knock-down cell lines, growth of procyclic T. brucei in culture is not affected by the at least 90% reduction of KDH activity in the RNAi knock-down cell line. Fig. 3C shows the effect of RNAi-induced ablation of the β-subunit of SCoAS on in organello ATP synthesis. As expected, oxidative phosphorylation is not affected. ATP production induced by α−ketoglutarate, however, is essentially eliminated. Furthermore, the malonate-resistant substrate level phosphorylation induced by pyruvate/succinate is also abolished in organelles from the induced cell line. These results show that the same SCoAS activity is used for substrate level phosphorylation in the citric acid and in the ASCT cycle. Interestingly, there appears to be a compensatory change in induced cells since the succinate present in the pyruvate/succinate mixture is ∼1.7-fold more efficiently used in oxidative phosphorylation than in the uninduced cells. SCoAS activity is essential for procyclic T. brucei, as evidenced by the observed growth arrest of induced cells after 3–5 days. Fig. 4D shows in organello ATP production assays from cell lines ablated for the E1 α-subunit of PDH. As expected, ATP production induced by succinate and α-ketoglutarate is normal. Substrate level phosphorylation in the ASCT cycle, however, is completely abolished. Furthermore, similar to the SCoAS knock-down cells, there appears to be a compensatory elevation of oxidative phosphorylation; the added succinate that does not contribute to oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria from uninduced cells results in a net ATP production reaching ∼50% of that observed in organelles from induced cells. Despite the fact that RNAi-induced ablation appears to completely abolish PDH activity, only a marginal growth phenotype is observed. This might, however, not only be due to the lack of ATP synthesis in the ASCT cycle but also to the reduced levels of acetyl-CoA, which is also expected to interrupt the citric acid cycle at the level of citrate synthase. Except for SCoAS, no strong growth phenotypes were observed in the RNAi knock-down cell lines for any of the tested enzymatic activities. This allowed us to produce RNAi cell lines in which two enzymatic activities are ablated simultaneously. In a practical sense, this was done by replacing the phleomycine resistance marker in the RNAi plasmids with a puromycine resistance gene. A previously characterized, clonal RNAi knock-down cell line for a single gene can then be transfected with a second plasmid carrying another gene. In a first such experiment, we created a cell line ablated for both KDH and for PDH activities. As expected, both type II and III ATP productions are eliminated in mitochondria from induced cells (Fig.4A). Furthermore, despite the fact that no or only a marginal growth phenotype is observed in the corresponding single RNAi knock-down cell lines (Fig. 3, B and D), a complete growth arrest is observed if both activities are ablated simultaneously. In fact, the cell line exhibits the same biochemical and growth phenotypes as were observed in the single RNAi-SCoAS knock-down cell line (Fig. 3C). In a second double knock-down cell line, both SDH and PDH activities were ablated. In organello ATP production assays show that oxidative phosphorylation induced by succinate as well as substrate level phosphorylation in the ASCT cycle are abolished. The substrate level phosphorylation in the citric acid cycle, however, is not affected (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the cell line shows no stronger growth phenotype than the corresponding single RNAi cell lines (Fig. 3, A and D). It therefore appears that the substrate level phosphorylation in the citric acid cycle alone is sufficient to support growth of procyclic T. brucei, albeit at a somewhat slower rate than in wild-type cells. In summary, these results suggest that substrate level phosphorylation linked to either the citric acid cycle or the ASCT cycle is essential for growth of procyclic T. brucei. We have used in organello ATP production in response to different substrates to study mitochondrial energy metabolism in procyclic T. brucei. Energy metabolism of trypanosome mitochondria has been investigated before, mainly by monitoring oxygen consumption in intact cells or isolated organelles (5Beattie D.S. Howton M.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Bienen E.J. Webster P. Fish W.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1991; 73: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In our study, we have directly measured ATP production, which has the advantage that it is not influenced by oxygen reduction linked to the alternative oxidase (21Chaudhuri M. Ajayi W. Hill G.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In organello ATP production assays were combined with RNAi-induced ablation of specific enzyme activities, which allowed us to selectively disrupt the distinct ATP production pathways. Growth of the RNAi knock-down cell lines was monitored in standard SDM-79 medium containing proline as well as glucose and pyruvate as carbon sources (11Brun R. Scho¨nenberger M. Acta Tropica. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar). Proline is expected to metabolize into α-ketoglutarate, fueling substrate level phosphorylation in the citric acid cycle as well as oxidative phosphorylation. Glucose and pyruvate, on the other hand, are used for substrate level phosphorylation in the ASCT cycle but can also be fed into the citric acid cycle. The SDM-79 medium therefore provides all required substrates for the three mitochondrial ATP production pathways. A summary of the phenotypes observed in the RNAi cell lines is shown in Table II. Succinate-induced oxidative phosphorylation can be abolished without significantly inhibiting growth (Figs. 3A and 4B). Substrate level phosphorylation either linked to the citric acid cycle or to the ASCT cycle, however, is essential since if both pathways are interrupted in the same cell line, either by ablating the SCoAS activity (Fig.3C) or by removing KDH and PDH simultaneously (Fig.4A), the cells stop growing.Table IIPhenotypes of RNAi cell linesRNAi-ablated activitiesATP production pathways2-aPlus or minus symbol indicates the presence or absence of the respective ATP production pathway.Growth2-b+++, growth rate identical to uninduced cells; ++, slightly slower growth than uninduced cells; –, no growth.Oxidative phosphorylationSubstrate level phosphorylationCitric acid cycleASCT cycleSDH–+++++KDH+–++++SCoAS+–––PDH++–++KDH/PDH+–––SDH/PDH–+–++2-a Plus or minus symbol indicates the presence or absence of the respective ATP production pathway.2-b +++, growth rate identical to uninduced cells; ++, slightly slower growth than uninduced cells; –, no growth. Open table in a new tab All in organello oxidative phosphorylation detected, irrespectively of which substrate is used, is entirely inhibited by malonate (Fig. 2) or absent in the SDH RNAi knock-down cell line (Fig.3A). This is also true for the ∼20% of oxidative phosphorylation induced by the NADH-generating substrate α-ketoglutarate (Fig. 2) and the one induced by glutamate (not shown), suggesting that no functional NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase linked to the respiratory chain exists in procyclic T. brucei. If this is indeed the case, the only entry point of mitochondrial reducing equivalents into the classic respiratory chain is via SDH. Intramitochondrial NAD may be regenerated in this scenario by NADH dehydrogenases, which are not linked to the respiratory chain (22Fang J. Beattie D.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3065-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or by fumarate reductase (23Hernandez F.R. Turrens J.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 93: 135-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). There is overwhelming evidence, such as the inability to obtain diskinetoplastic mutants (24Schnaufer A. Domingo G.J. Stuart K. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 1071-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and the observed growth arrest of a cytochrome c1knock-down cell line (not shown), that the respiratory chain is essential in procyclic T. brucei. It is therefore surprising that the lack of SDH activity does not result in a growth defect. There are at least two possible explanations for these results: (a) The essential function of the respiratory chain may be to use electrons from the cytosolic substrate glycerol-3-phosphate. Indeed, an intermembrane space localized glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity has been shown in procyclic T. brucei(13Allemann N. Schneider A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Unlike in bloodstream cells, this enzyme is at least in part linked to the classic respiratory chain since glycerol-3-phosphate is able to induce ATP production in isolated organelles. Interestingly, there is even more ATP synthesized in response to glycerol-3-phosphate than to succinate (13Allemann N. Schneider A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, succinate is known to accumulate during growth of procyclic T. brucei (25TerKuile B.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4699-4705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that only a fraction of it is used for oxidative phosphorylation. (b) It may not be the ATP production that is the essential function of the respiratory chain but the depletion of cytosolic oxygen, which according to the Ox Tox model was the primary function of ancestral mitochondria (26Kurland C.G. Andersson S.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 786-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Neither ablation of SDH nor of KDH activity results in a growth phenotype, suggesting that a complete citric acid cycle is not essential for procyclic T. brucei. SCoAS, on the other hand, is required for growth. Unlike in most other organisms, the trypanosomal SCoAS is not only linked to the citric acid but also linked to the ASCT cycle (8vanHellemond J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Tielens A.G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3036-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Ablation of SCoAS therefore interrupts two pathways, which may explain why it is required for growth. The essential function of SCoAS is in agreement with a previous study showing that an inhibitor of SCoAS phosphorylation was able to arrest growth of procyclic T. brucei (27Hunger-Glaser I. Brun R. Linder M. Seebeck T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 100: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Detection of substrate level phosphorylation with pyruvate/succinate, which depends on PDH and SCoAS but not on KDH activity, for the first time directly demonstrates ATP production in the ASCT cycle. Removal of PDH activity interrupts the ASCT cycle in the in organello system as well as the citrate synthase branch of the citric acid cycle, which, however, only marginally contributes to ATP production (not shown). The slight growth phenotype observed in the PDH RNAi knock-down cell line therefore suggests that the ASCT cycle is dispensable for procyclic T. brucei, provided that substrate level phosphorylation in the citric acid cycle is still operational. However, in vivo, not all acetyl-CoA might be produced by PDH alone. To definitively decide whether the ASCT pathway is essential, a knock-out cell line for the only enzymatic activity specific for the ASCT cycle, the acetate:succinate CoA transferase, whose gene has not been identified yet, would be required. The procyclic stage of T. brucei depends on a functional respiratory chain (see above), and the same is true forSaccharomyces cerevisiae, which is grown on non-fermentable carbon sources. Interestingly, the relative importance of the different citric acid cycle enzymes appears to be very different in the two organisms. Whereas in T. brucei SDH, KDH, and PDH appear to be dispensable, they are required for growth of yeast on non-fermentable carbon sources. On the other hand, SCoAS, which is essential for growth of procyclic T. brucei, is the only citric acid cycle enzyme of yeast that can be disrupted without abolishing growth on non-fermentable carbon sources (28Przybyla-Zawislak B. Dennis R.A. Zakharkin S.O. McCammon M.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 736-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 29Przybyla-Zawislak B. Gadde D.M. Ducharme K. McCammon M.T. Genetics. 1999; 152: 153-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, our results suggest that substrate level phosphorylation is essential for the growth of procyclic T. brucei. However, it does not seem to matter in which pathway, the citric acid or the ASCT cycle, the ATP is being synthesized. Neither the ATP produced in the citric acid cycle, assuming that succinate accumulates as an end product, nor the ATP produced in the ASCT cycle depends on oxygen. Procyclic T. brucei is adapted to life in the digestive tract of the tsetse fly. The fact that at least one pathway encompassing substrate level phosphorylation is essential for survival may therefore reflect an adaptation to the partly hypoxic conditions in the fly. Furthermore, our study also shows that in T. brucei, RNAi-induced ablation of defined enzymatic activities is a powerful tool to untangle the complex interrelations of different pathways in a metabolic network. We thank Drs. P. Englund and G. Cross for providing us with the pZJM vector, pLew100, and the T. brucei 29-13 strain, respectively.

Beyond this simplified scheme, cAMP inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and inhibition of PI3K, by a specific inhibitor, stimulates melanogenesis. However, the link between the PI3K pathway and melanogenesis remained to be elucidated. In this report, we showed that cAMP, through a protein kinase A-independent mechanism, led to inhibition of AKT phosphorylation and activity. Consistent with the role of AKT in the regulation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), cAMP decreased the phosphorylation of GSK3β and stimulated its activity. Further, experiments were performed to investigate the role of GSK3β in the regulation of MITF expression and function. We observed that GSK3β regulated neither MITF promoter activity nor the intrinsic transcriptional activity of MITF but synergized with MITF to activate the tyrosinase promoter. Additionally, lithium, a GSK3β inhibitor, impaired the response of the tyrosinase promoter to cAMP, and cAMP increased the binding of MITF to the M-box. Taking into account that GSK3β phosphorylates MITF and increases the ability of MITF to bind its target sequence, our results indicate that activation of GSK3β by cAMP facilitates MITF binding to the tyrosinase promoter, thereby leading to stimulation of melanogenesis.

In human, melanins play a crucial photo-protective role against the carcinogenic and deleterious effects of ultraviolet radiation of solar light. Thus, numerous efforts have been made to understand the molecular mechanisms that govern pigment production. In mice as well as in humans, it is now well established that pro-opiomelanocortic peptides, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)1 and α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (αMSH), play a key role in the control of pigmentation. Indeed, any disturbance of αMSH or ACTH signaling, due to mutations of the melanocortin type I receptor (MC1R) (1Valverde P. Healy E. Jackson I. Rees J.L. Thody A.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 328-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar) or to a decrease of αMSH or ACTH expression, results in an inhibition of melanin synthesis (2Krude H. Biebermann H. Luck W. Horn R. Brabant G. Gruters A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). Conversely, pathologic overexpression of αMSH (3Pears J.S. Jung R.T. Bartlett W. Browning M.C. Kenicer K. Thody A.J. Br. J. Dermatol. 1992; 126: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or ACTH (4Lamerson C.L. Nordlund J.J. Nordlund J.J. Boissy R.E. Hearing V.J.

Nature. 1961; 189: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Binding of ACTH or αMSH to the Gαs-coupled MC1R leads to adenylate cyclase activation, elevation of intracellular cAMP, and activation of the protein kinase A (PKA) (8Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17359-17362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cAMP pathway plays a pivotal role in the regulation of skin pigmentation. Indeed, patients with McCune-Albright syndrome display large hyperpigmented areas caused by an activating mutation in the Gαs protein that controls cAMP level (9Schwindinger W.F. Francomano C.A.

Further, mutations in the type Iα regulatory subunit of PKA, leading to a constitutive activation of PKA, have been described in patients with Carney syndrome characterized by spotty skin pigmentation (11Casey M. Vaughan C.J., He, J. Hatcher C.J. Winter J.M. Weremowicz S. Montgomery K. Kucherlapati R. Morton C.C. Basson C.T. J. Clin.

Finally, the propigmenting effects of αMSH can be mimicked, in vitro, by forskolin that directly binds and activates adenylate cyclase (13Englaro W. Rezzonico R. Durand-Clement M. Lallemand D.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 205-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations clearly demonstrate the meaningful role of the cAMP pathway in the regulation of melanogenesis and skin pigmentation by melanocortins. cAMP increases melanogenesis mainly through the stimulation of tyrosinase expression, the enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting reaction of the melanin synthesis process (15Hearing V.J., Jr. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 154-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 16Korner A.

We have shown that cAMP, through activation of PKA and CREB transcription factor, promotes an increase in the expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) (18Bertolotto C. Abbe P. Hemesath T.J. Bille K. Fisher D.E. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), a melanocyte-specific transcription factor crucial for melanocyte development and differentiation (19Hodgkinson C.A.

Genet. 1994; 8: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). As a result, MITF binds to and activates the tyrosinase promoter, leading thereby to stimulation of melanogenesis (21Goding C.R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 503-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In the course of these studies, we observed that cAMP regulates other signaling pathways that are also involved in the control of melanogenesis. In melanocytes and melanoma cells, elevation of the intracellular cAMP content results in the activation of the Ras/ERK cascade (13Englaro W. Rezzonico R. Durand-Clement M. Lallemand D. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24315-24320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, activation of Ras/ERK leads to an inhibition of melanogenesis, and this pathway has been thought to be a feedback mechanism preventing an excessive production of melanin that would be toxic for cells (24Englaro W. Bertolotto C. Busca R. Brunet A. Pages G. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9966-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Indeed, ERK and RSK (ribosomal S6 kinase), which is activated by ERK, phosphorylate MITF and promote its degradation, thereby leading to an inhibition of tyrosinase expression and melanogenesis (25Hemesath T.J. Price E.R. Takemoto C. Badalian T. Fisher D.E. Nature. 1998; 391: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 26Wu M. Hemesath T.J. Takemoto C.M. Horstmann M.A. Wells A.G. Price E.R. Fisher D.Z. Fisher D.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 301-312PubMed Google Scholar). Further, in B16 melanoma cells, we showed previously that cAMP inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (27Busca R. Bertolotto C. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31824-31830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Additionally, the PI3K-specific inhibitor, LY294002, stimulates melanogenesis. These observations suggest that the PI3K pathway might be involved in the regulation of melanin synthesis by cAMP. Although the PKA/CREB and Ras/ERK pathways have been thoroughly dissected, the involvement of the PI3K pathway in cAMP-induced melanogenesis remains to be elucidated. One of the key effectors of PI3K is the serine/threonine kinase AKT. In response to growth factors and hormones, AKT is activated by binding to the membrane PI3K phospholipid products and phosphorylation on threonine 308 and serine 473 (28Bellacosa A. Testa J.R. Staal S.P. Tsichlis P.N. Science. 1991; 254: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 29Jones P.F. Jakubowicz T. Pitossi F.J. Maurer F. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4171-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Activated AKT phosphorylates the glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) on serine 9 and promotes its inactivation (30Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). GSK3β is a serine/threonine kinase, first described to regulate glycogen synthase activity. More recently, GSK3β was demonstrated to be a key mediator of vertebrate development, tumorigenesis, and cell differentiation (31Kim L. Kimmel A.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 32Plyte S.E. Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Pulverer B.J. Woodgett J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Taking into account the role of cAMP in the regulation of melanogenesis, we wished to evaluate the involvement of AKT and GSK3β in the regulation of melanocyte differentiation by cAMP. In this report, we clearly demonstrated, in B16 melanoma cells, that cAMP, by a PKA-independent mechanism, led to inhibition of AKT phosphorylation and activity, resulting in a dephosphorylation and activation of GSK3β. Further, we showed that GSK3β regulated neither MITF transcription nor MITF intrinsic transcriptional activity. However, we found that lithium, a GSK3β inhibitor, decreased the response to cAMP of the tyrosinase promoter. Additionally, we showed that GSK3β synergized with MITF to stimulate the tyrosinase promoter. Finally, short cAMP treatment, which did not up-regulate MITF expression, enhanced the binding of MITF to the M-box sequence of the tyrosinase promoter. Together, our results suggest that activation of GSK3β by cAMP is involved in the regulation of cAMP-induced melanogenesis by up-regulating the binding of MITF to the tyrosinase promoter.

Western blot assays were representative of at least three experiments. The luciferase reporter plasmids pTyro and pMITF and the expression vector encoding MITF were described previously (18Bertolotto C. Abbe P. Hemesath T.J. Bille K. Fisher D.E. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The pCDNA3 vector encoding GSK3β was kindly provided by Dr. T.C Dale (London, UK). B16 melanoma cells were seeded in 24-well dishes, and transient transfections were performed the following day using 2 μl of LipofectAMINE and 0.5 μg of total DNA plasmid. pCMV-β-galactosidase was transfected with the test plasmids to control the variability in transfection efficiency. After 48 h, cells were harvested in 50 μl of lysis buffer and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. All transfections were repeated at least three times. B16 cells were seeded in 6-well dishes, and transient transfections were performed the following day using 10 μl of LipofectAMINE and 1.5 μg of HA-tagged AKT or 1 μg of HA-tagged AKT with 2 μg of empty pCDNA3 or vector encoding RasV12. HA-tagged AKT in the mammalian expression vector pCDNA3 was a kind gift from Dr. G. Baier (Innsbruck, Austria), and the vector encoding RasV12 was provided by Dr. A. Eychene (Orsay, France). Cells were treated for 1 h with 50 μm forskolin or 15 μmLY294002, and then they were lysed in buffer A and immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody coupled to protein G-Sepharose for 3 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were washed, and AKT activity was assayed with Crosstide as a substrate in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm ATP, 30 μm Crosstide, and 3.3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. The phosphorylation reaction was stopped by spotting onto Whatman p81 papers and immersing them in 1% orthophosphoric acid. The papers were washed, rinsed in ethanol, and air-dried, and the radioactivity was determined by Cerenkov counting. B16 cells were seeded in 6-well dishes, exposed to 50 μm forskolin or 15 μm LY294002 for the times indicated in the figure legends, and lysed as described previously for the AKT assay, and GSK3β was immunoprecipitated with an anti-GSK3β antibody for 3 h at 4 °C. The activity of GSK3β was assayed with GS peptide-2 as a substrate in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm glycogen synthase peptide-2 as substrate, 10 μm ATP, and 3.3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 30 °C. The following steps were as described for the AKT assay. Nuclear extracts from control cells or cells incubated with forskolin for 1 h were prepared as described previously (34Bertolotto C. Bille K. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1665-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A double-stranded synthetic M-box, 5′-GAAAAAGTCATGTGCTTTGCAGAAGA-3′, was γ-32P-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase. 5 μg of nuclear proteins were preincubated in a binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 4% glycerol, 80 μg/ml of salmon sperm DNA, 0.1 μg poly(dIdC), 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm spermidine for 15 min on ice. Then, 30,000–50,000 cpm of 32P-labeled probe were added to the binding reaction for 10 min at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1 acrylamide-bisacrylamide) in TBE buffer (22.5 mm Tris borate, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8) for 1.5 h at 100 V. For supershift assays, 0.3 μl of preimmune serum or anti-MITF antibody (33Bertolotto C. Bille K. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) were preincubated with nuclear extracts in the binding reaction buffer before adding the labeled probe. First, we investigated, in B16 melanoma cells, the effects of two cAMP-elevating agents, αMSH and forskolin, on AKT. Immunoblotting of cell lysates with phospho-specific antibodies to AKT revealed that αMSH, a physiologic melanocyte-differentiating agent, as well as forskolin, induced a strong inhibition of AKT phosphorylation on both threonine 308 and serine 473 as compared with control cells (Fig.1A). As expected, LY294002, a specific pharmacological inhibitor of PI3K, also abolished AKT phosphorylation on both residues. Increase in cAMP content led to a complete dephosphorylation of AKT after 30 min (Fig. 1B). The effect of LY294002 was even more rapid since no phosphorylation persisted after 15 min of treatment. Further, B16 cells, transfected with a vector encoding a HA-tagged AKT were left untreated or exposed to forskolin or to LY294002 for 30 min. Then, HA-AKT was immunoprecipitated to perform anin vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 1C, forskolin and LY294002 reduced the activity of AKT to about 50 and 70%, respectively, indicating that the decrease in AKT phosphorylation correlated with an inhibition of its activity. In each experiment, detection of AKT regardless of its phosphorylation state ensured even loading of each lane (Fig. 1). To investigate whether cAMP mediates its effect through a PI3K-dependent mechanism, B16 cells were infected with an adenovirus encoding a constitutively active (p110CAAX) or a kinase-dead (p110KD) form of the p110 subunit of PI3K. B16 cells were then exposed or not to forskolin, and phosphorylation of AKT was examined. p110CAAX stimulated the phosphorylation of AKT over the basal and markedly reduced the effect of cAMP as compared with cells infected with a control adenovirus (Fig. 2A). The kinase dead-mutant had no effect on AKT regulation by cAMP. Therefore, in B16 melanoma cells, cAMP leads to an inhibition of AKT phosphorylation and activity that appears to be mediated through a PI3K-dependent mechanism. To better define the site of cAMP action, experiments were designed to evaluate whether cAMP acted upstream of p21ras, which has been described to activate PI3K. B16 cells were co-transfected with vectors encoding a HA-tagged AKT and a constitutively active mutant of p21ras, RasV12. Cells were treated or not with forskolin, and HA-AKT was immunoprecipitated to perform an in vitro kinase assay. Consistent with Fig.1C, forskolin reduced the activity of AKT to about 50% in the presence of a pCDNA3 empty plasmid (Fig.2B). Further, co-expression of HA-AKT with RasV12 increased the basal AKT activity, which was also inhibited by forskolin to about 50%. These results indicate that cAMP acts independently of Ras to inhibit AKT. Next, we wanted to determine whether AKT inactivation by cAMP had an impact on downstream events in B16 melanoma cells. To this aim, we focused our attention on GSK3β, a cellular substrate of AKT. Immunoblotting experiments of cells exposed to forskolin or to LY294002 with phospho-specific antibody revealed a decrease of GSK3β phosphorylation on serine 9 as compared with control cells (Fig. 3A). Next, we investigated the effect of this dephosphorylation on GSK3β activity. After treatment of the cells with forskolin or LY294002, GSK3β was immunoprecipitated and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. Results presented in Fig. 3B show that forskolin and LY294002 stimulated GSK3β activity. Immunodetection of total GSK3β indicated that these differences were not due to variations in the level of protein expression. To confirm the activation of GSK3β, the effects of forskolin and LY294002 on the phosphorylation of endogenous substrates of GSK3β such as the glycogen synthase and the microtubule-associated protein, Tau, were then analyzed in intact cells. Using phospho-specific antibodies, we observed that forskolin and LY294002 increased phosphorylation of both glycogen synthase and Tau protein as compared with cells in basal condition (Fig. 3C). The blot was also incubated with an anti-ERK2 antibody to control for the equal loading of the gel. In conclusion, these results clearly demonstrate that in B16 melanoma cells, GSK3β is activated in response to cAMP. Although PKA is the major cellular target of cAMP, this nucleotide appears to have some PKA-independent actions (35Busca R. Abbe P. Mantoux F. Aberdam E. Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2900-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 36Gray P.C. Scott J.D. Catterall W.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 37Matthews G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 245-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, to define whether PKA was involved in the regulation of AKT and GSK3β following cAMP treatment, we used H89, a cell-permeable and selective inhibitor of PKA. Treatment of melanoma cells with H89 had no effect on forskolin-induced inhibition of AKT phosphorylation on threonine 308 and serine 473 (Fig.4A). Immunoblotting also indicated that H89 did not prevent the inhibition of GSK3β phosphorylation on serine 9 induced by forskolin (Fig. 4A). The functionality of H89 was assessed by its ability to block forskolin-induced phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133. Detection of ERK2 ensured that each lane was evenly loaded. These results clearly indicate that in B16 melanoma cells, PKA is not involved in the regulation of AKT and GSK3β by cAMP. Interestingly, we have recently reported that cAMP stimulates the Ras/ERK pathway via a PKA-independent mechanism (35Busca R. Abbe P. Mantoux F. Aberdam E. Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2900-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wished to explore the possibility that the Ras/ERK pathway was involved in the effect of cAMP on AKT and GSK3β. To this purpose, we took advantage of C. sordelii LT, which is an inhibitor of p21ras and thus allows the inhibition of the downstream cascade. Immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies demonstrated that LT failed to abolish the inhibition of AKT and GSK3β phosphorylation induced by forskolin exposure (Fig. 4B). The functionality of LT was demonstrated by its ability to block forskolin-induced phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/ERK2. Together, these results show that in B16 melanoma cells, cAMP regulates the AKT/GSK3β cascade via a mechanism that involves neither PKA nor Ras/ERK signaling pathways. As MITF, through the regulation of tyrosinase expression is a key actor in cAMP-induced melanogenesis, we explored the possibility that GSK3β regulates MITF expression through a stimulation of the transcriptional activity of its promoter. As shown in Fig. 5A, GSK3β did not alter basal or cAMP-induced MITF promoter activity, demonstrating that GSK3β did not affect MITFtranscription. We also investigated the possible involvement of GSK3β in the stimulation of MITF activity. Using a mammalian one-hybrid system, we found that GSK3β did not up-regulate the intrinsic transcriptional activity of MITF (Fig. 5B). Finally, we wished to evaluate the potential role of GSK3β in the regulation of tyrosinase expression, the enzyme that controls melanin synthesis. To do so, B16 cells were transfected with the tyrosinase promoter and then exposed to forskolin in presence or absence of lithium, an inhibitor of GSK3β. The results presented on Fig.6A showed that lithium reduced by 50% the response to cAMP of the tyrosinase promoter. Additionally, we showed that GSK3β by itself did not significantly affect the activity of the tyrosinase promoter but synergized with MITF to stimulate the tyrosinase promoter (Fig. 6B). Together, these data suggest that GSK3β, through the control of MITF function, is involved in the regulation of tyrosinase transcription by cAMP. Finally, gel shift assays were performed with nuclear extracts from control cells or cells that have been exposed to cAMP for 1 h. We observed an increased binding of nuclear proteins from cAMP-treated cells to the M-box probe as compared with control cells (Fig.6C, lower panel).Figure 6GSK3β mediates the effect of cAMP on the tyrosinase promoter. B16 cells were transfected with 0.3 μg of pTyro (A). After transfection, cells were incubated with 50 μm forskolin and/or 15 mm LiCl for 48 h. B16 cells were transfected with 0.3 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmid pTyro and 0.05 μg of pCDNA3 encoding MITF and/or 0.1 μg of pCDNA3 encoding GSK3β (B). The total DNA was maintained constant at 0.5 μg per point by the addition of empty pCDNA3 vector. Luciferase activity was measured and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Results are expressed as fold stimulation of the basal luciferase activity from each experiment. Data are means ± S.E. of three experiments performed in triplicate. Gel shift assay was performed using the32P-labeled M-box and B16 nuclear extracts from control cells (C) or cells treated for 1 h with forskolin (Fsk) (C). Binding reactions were performed in the presence of 0.3 μl of preimmune serum (PI) or with 0.3 μl of a specific anti-MITF serum (I). The Western blot experiment in thelower panel shows the detection of total MITF in each condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The complexes were shifted by specific MITF antibody, indicating that cAMP stimulated the formation of MITF/M-box complexes. Since cAMP did not stimulate MITF expression at 1 h (Fig. 6C,upper panel), we concluded that cAMP increased the ability of MITF to bind its target sequence. Together, these results suggest that GSK3β plays a key role in cAMP-induced melanogenesis by enhancing the binding of MITF to the tyrosinase promoter. In the course of investigating the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of melanocyte differentiation, we have observed previously, in B16 cells, an inhibition of PI3K during cAMP-induced melanogenesis (27Busca R. Bertolotto C. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31824-31830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Since the inhibition of PI3K stimulates melanogenesis, we wished to dissect, in the present report, the molecular events that connected the PI3K pathway to melanin synthesis. We first focused our attention on AKT, a well characterized kinase that functions downstream of PI3K. Depending on the cell type, cAMP has been reported to inhibit or stimulate AKT (38Filippa N. Sable C.L. Filloux C. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4989-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 39Li M. Wang X. Meintzer M.K. Laessig T. Birnbaum M.J. Heidenreich K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9356-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Thus, we verified the effect of cAMP on AKT in B16 melanoma cells. Our results showed that cAMP potently inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT at threonine 308 and serine 473 and led to an inhibition of AKT activity. Additionally, the effect of cAMP on AKT was abolished in the presence of a constitutively active mutant of PI3K, demonstrating that cAMP promotes an inhibition of AKT through a PI3K-dependent mechanism. However, overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of p21ras did not block the inhibition of AKT evoked by cAMP, indicating that the inhibition of AKT by cAMP is mediated through a p21ras-independent pathway. It should be noted that we have reported previously an activation of p21ras by cAMP in melanocytes and melanoma cells (35Busca R. Abbe P. Mantoux F. Aberdam E. Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2900-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Thus, in the conditions in which we observed an inhibition of AKT, p21ras is activated, demonstrating that the activation of p21ras cannot prevent the inhibition of AKT. AKT phosphorylates GSK3β at serine 9, leading to GSK3β inactivation. Therefore, the inhibition of AKT by cAMP should lead to the activation of GSK3β. However, it has also been reported that PKA directly phosphorylates GSK3β at serine 9 and inhibits its activity (39Li M. Wang X. Meintzer M.K. Laessig T. Birnbaum M.J. Heidenreich K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9356-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 40Fang X., Yu, S.X., Lu, Y. Bast R.C., Jr. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11960-11965Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In B16 cells, cAMP decreased the phosphorylation of GSK3β at serine 9 and led to the stimulation of its kinase activity. Consistent with the effect of AKT on GSK3β and the effect of cAMP on AKT, we demonstrate for the first time that cAMP promotes an activation of GSK3β. As PKA is the major intracellular target of cAMP, it was tempting to propose that the effect of cAMP on AKT and GSK3β involved the PKA. However, a pharmacological inhibitor of PKA did not impair the effect of cAMP on AKT and GSK3β. As mentioned above, in B16 cells, cAMP also stimulates the Ras/ERK pathway via a PKA-independent mechanism (35Busca R. Abbe P. Mantoux F. Aberdam E. Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2900-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that the activation of the Ras/ERK pathway could mediate the effect of cAMP on AKT and GSK3β. However, inhibition of p21ras, and consequently of ERK, by C. sordeliilethal toxin did not alter the effect of cAMP on AKT and GSK3β. Thus, cAMP leads to an inhibition of AKT and a stimulation of GSK3β through PKA and p21ras/ERK-independent pathways. Recently, it has been also reported that cAMP inhibits AKT through a mechanism that does not involve PKA (41Wang L. Liu F. Adamo M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37242-37249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). GSK3β has been widely implicated in cell homeostasis by its ability to phosphorylate a broad range of substrates including the glycogen synthase, the microtubule-associated protein Tau, and β-catenin (42Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cAMP-induced activation of GSK3β stimulated phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein, Tau (Fig.2C). Considering the role of Tau in the organization of microtubule and actin cytoskeleton (43Garcia M.L. Cleveland D.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 44Gundersen G.G. Cook T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), as well as in the regulation of organelle traffic (45Stamer K. Vogel R. Thies E. Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1051-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar), our results point to a potential role of GSK3β and Tau in the regulation of cAMP-induced dendritogenesis and melanosome transport, two key parameters of melanocyte differentiation. Further, phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK3β promotes its degradation and prevents its translocation to the nucleus, where β-catenin acts in concert with the lymphoid enhancer factor-1/T-cell factor (LEF-1/TCF) family of transcription factors to transactivate target genes. The promoter of MITF contains a LEF-1 binding site, and β-catenin stimulates the transcriptional activity of the MITF promoter (46Takeda K. Yasumoto K. Takada R. Takada S. Watanabe K. Udono T. Saito H. Takahashi K. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14013-14016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Thus, the activation of GSK3β following cAMP exposure should lead to an inhibition of the MITF promoter activity due to β-catenin degradation. However, in B16 cells, elevation of the cAMP content did not induce the phosphorylation of β-catenin and did not affect the activity of a TOPFlash reporter plasmid bearing LEF-1 binding sites (data not shown). Cotransfection of MITF promoter reporter construct with GSK3β confirms that GSK3β did not regulate the transcriptional activity of the MITF promoter (Fig.5A). Recently, Takeda et al. (47Takeda K. Takemoto C. Kobayashi I. Watanabe A. Nobukuni Y. Fisher D.E. Tachibana M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that GSK3β phosphorylates MITF on serine 298, thereby enhancing its binding to the tyrosinase promoter. Interestingly, mutation of the MITF serine 298 has been identified in patients with Waardenburg syndrome type II, which is characterized by pigmentary disorders, emphasizing the physiopathologic importance to understand the role of GSK3β in the control of pigmentation. Therefore, since GSK3β stimulates neither the MITF promoter activity nor the intrinsic transcriptional activity of MITF, we hypothesized that cAMP, through GSK3β activation, could increase the ability of MITF to bind its target sequence. Consistent with the work from Takeda et al.(47Takeda K. Takemoto C. Kobayashi I. Watanabe A. Nobukuni Y. Fisher D.E. Tachibana M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that GSK3β stimulated the action of MITF on the tyrosinase promoter. Additionally, lithium, a GSK3β inhibitor, decreased cAMP-induced stimulation of the tyrosinase promoter. Finally, we demonstrated that cAMP increases the binding of MITF to the M-box sequence. To demonstrate the key role of the serine 298 phosphorylation, we studied the effect of an MITF mutant, MITF S298A. This mutant cannot be phosphorylated by GSK3β, and thus the effect of this mutant should not be increased by GSK3β or by cAMP. However, in agreement with the previous observation of Takeda et al. (47Takeda K. Takemoto C. Kobayashi I. Watanabe A. Nobukuni Y. Fisher D.E. Tachibana M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), this mutant is devoid of any transcriptional activity (data not shown). Further, we constructed two other mutants in which the serine 298 was replaced either by an aspartate or by a glutamate. The positive charge of these amino acids was expected to mimic the charge brought by the phosphate group. Unexpectedly, these two mutants were also unable to transactivate the tyrosinase promoter (data not shown). Together, these results show that in parallel to the PKA/CREB pathway, which stimulates MITF expression, cAMP, through the activation of GSK3β, increases the ability of MITF to bind to the tyrosinase promoter. These two pathways cooperate, allowing cAMP-elevating agents to efficiently stimulate tyrosinase transcription and thereby melanogenesis. In conclusion, elevation of intracellular cAMP leads to the activation of a complex network of signaling pathways that converge to MITF to control melanin synthesis and melanocyte differentiation (Fig. 7). Our findings, demonstrating that GSK3β plays an active role in cAMP-induced melanogenesis and in melanocyte differentiation, bring information of paramount importance on the molecular mechanisms that control melanin synthesis and skin pigmentation.

https://openalex.org/W2121277695,"Up-regulation of several stress proteins such as heat-shock proteins and glucose-regulated proteins participate in tolerance against environmental stress. Previously, we found that protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) is specifically up-regulated in response to hypoxia/brain ischemia in astrocytes. In addition, the overexpression of this gene into neurons protects against apoptotic cell death induced by hypoxia/brain ischemia. To address the detailed function of PDI, we screened for proteins that interact with PDI using the yeast two-hybrid system. We report here that PDI interacts with ubiquilin, which has a ubiquitin-like domain and a ubiquitin-associated domain. Interestingly, ubiquilin is also up-regulated in response to hypoxia in glial cells with a time course similar to that of PDI induction. In hypoxia-treated glial cells, the endogenous ubiquilin and PDI were almost completely co-localized, suggesting that ubiquilin is an endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein. Overexpression of this gene in neuronal cells resulted in significant inhibition of the DNA fragmentation triggered by hypoxia, but not that induced by nitric oxide or staurosporine. Moreover, ubiquilin has the ability to attenuate CHOP induction by hypoxia. These observations suggested that ubiquilin together with PDI have critical functions as regulatory proteins for CHOP-mediated cell death, and therefore up-regulation of these proteins may result in acquisition of tolerance against ischemic stress in glial cells.

Commun. 2001; 286: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). These biosynthetic responses have been hypothesized to contribute to maintenance of cellular homeostasis during adaptation to altered environmental conditions. In particular, neurons are fragile and very sensitive to stress, whereas glial cells show tolerance to stress in the brain (3Swanson R.A. Choi D.W. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1993; 13: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 4Coyle J.T. Puttfarchen P. Science. 1993; 262: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (3533) Google Scholar, 5Ferrer I. Tortoise A. Macaya A. Sierra A. Moreno D. Munell F. Blanco R. Squier W. Brain Pathol. 1994; 4: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For example, brain ischemic stress results in neuronal apoptosis, but has no effect on glial cells. Under these conditions, several proteins such as HSPs and GRPs are induced in glial cells. Previously, we reported that protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI, EC 5.3.4.1) is up-regulated in response to hypoxia/brain ischemia in glial cells (6Tanaka S. Uehara T. Nomura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10388-10393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). PDI is a multifunctional protein mainly located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (7Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3553-3556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Freedman R.B. Cell. 1989; 57: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). During protein folding in the ER, PDI catalyzes thiol/disulfide exchange, including disulfide bond formation and rearrangement reactions (9Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). PDI has two domains with homology to the small, redox-active protein, thioredoxin (10Edman J.C. Ellis L. Blacher R.W. Roth R.A. Rutter R.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The thiol/disulfide centers of the two thioredoxin-like domains function as two independent active sites (11Vuori K. Myllyla R. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7211-7214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increased PDI expression in neurons resulted in both attenuation of the loss of cell viability in vitro and reduction of the number of DNA-fragmented cells in the rat hippocampal CA1 subregion in vivo. Therefore, it has been suggested that up-regulated PDI has an essential role in glial cell survival under severe conditions. The ER is an organelle in which secretory proteins are folded and processed before export from the cell (12Andrews D.W. Johnson A.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 365-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The ER undergoes stress responses when unfolded immature proteins accumulate (13Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 14Sidrauski C. Chapman R. Walter R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 245-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Although severe ER stress can result in apoptosis through ER-specific caspase-12 (15Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N., Li, E., Xu, J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar), the ER withstands relatively mild stress through the regulation of expression of stress proteins such as GRPs, oxygen-regulated proteins, and PDI. These stress proteins behave as molecular chaperones, i.e. functional proteins that assist in the maturation and transport of unfolded secretory proteins (16Gillece P. Luz M.J. Lennarz W.J. Cruz F.

In the present study, we attempted to isolate PDI-interacting proteins as protective factors against hypoxia by yeast two-hybrid screening. Our results indicated that ubiquilin interacts with PDI both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we showed that ubiquilin is up-regulated in response to hypoxia and suppresses hypoxia-induced neuronal cell death, suggesting that the interaction of ubiquilin with PDI may contribute to adaptive responses to ischemic stress, thereby ultimately contributing to enhanced survival of neurons. Rabbit polyclonal anti-ubiquilin antibody was produced by immunization with synthetic peptide containing the N-terminal 15 amino acids of ubiquilin, followed by affinity chromatography using immobilized protein A. Mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody was purchased from MBL (Japan). Anti-rabbit IgG and mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa 488 or 594, and fluorescein di-β-d-galactopyranoside were purchased from Molecular Probes. Anti-FLAG M5 monoclonal antibody and anti-HA polyclonal antibody were purchased from Sigma and Santa Cruz, respectively. pEGFP and the yeast two-hybrid system were from CLONTECH. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Full-length ubiquilin and PDI cDNAs and several truncated mutants were isolated from human neuroblastoma RNA by RT-PCR. For yeast two-hybrid assay, full-length PDI and ubiquilin cDNA and several truncated fragments were subcloned into pAS2-1 and pACT2 (CLONTECH), respectively. The PDI expression vector-fused HA tag in its C-terminal (PDI-HA) was engineered. The cDNAs encoding ubiquilin and calreticulin tagged with FLAG and the HA epitope at the N-terminal (FLAG-ubiquilin and HA-calreticulin) were subcloned into mammalian expression vector pCR3.1, respectively. The pAS2-1/PDI plasmid, which contained the full sequence of the PDI coding region, was used for the yeast two-hybrid library screening to isolate PDI-interacting proteins. The two-hybrid screen was performed with a pretransformed cDNA library derived from the human fetal kidney mRNA (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. GAL4-BD/p53 and GAL4-AD/SV40 T-antigen were used as positive controls in this assay. GST and GST-ubiquilin were purified from a 1-liter culture of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pGEX-6P-1 and pGEX-GST-ubiquilin, respectively, as described previously (25Ahn S.J. Han S.J., Mo, H.J. Chung J.K. Hong S.H. Park T.K. Kim C.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Lysates from SK-N-MC cells were first incubated with 3 μg of GST or GST-ubiquilin for 4 h in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 0.25% gelatin, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.02% NaN3 and then applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). After extensive washing of the column, the proteins recovered from the resin were separated in a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS, blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter, and reacted with an anti-PDI antibody. Human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC and SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in modified Eagle's medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. Human astrocytoma CCF-STTG1 cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. When the cells became subconfluent, they were cultured in a mixture of 5% CO2and the balance of N2 in a humidified incubator (ANX-1, HIRASAWA, Tokyo, Japan) at 37 °C within a sealed, anaerobic, gloved cabinet containing a catalyst to scavenge free oxygen as described previously (6Tanaka S. Uehara T. Nomura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10388-10393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 26Araya R. Uehara T. Nomura Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 27Uehara T. Kaneko M. Tanaka S. Okuma Y. Nomura Y. Brain Res. 1999; 823: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Oxygen tension in the chamber and medium were measured using a oxygen analyzer (Teledyne) and a blood gas analyzer (ABL-2, Radiometer, Sweden), respectively. The oxygen levels in the cabinet were measured with a monitor sensitive to oxygen concentrations of <10 ppm throughout the incubation period. Oxygen tension in the culture medium at 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 6 h, and 48 h after transfer into the hypoxic chamber fell to 4.3, 3.0, 2.2, 2.0, and 2.0 ± 0.2%, respectively. The medium was then changed, and the cells were cultured under normal conditions for the indicated periods (reoxygenation). SK-N-MC cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged for 10 min. The resultant supernatant was incubated for 16 h with the indicated antibodies, which had been precoupled with protein G-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer, boiled for 5 min with SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat milk for 1 h and then treated with primary antibody (1:1000 dilution) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The immunoreactive bands were revealed by chemiluminescence (ECL Western detection kit; AmershamBiosciences). To examine the kinetics of ubiquilin induction by hypoxia in the CCF-STTG1 cells, the cells were cultured in a mixture of 5% CO2 and the balance of the N2 in a humidified anaerobic incubator at 37 °C for the indicated periods as described (26Araya R. Uehara T. Nomura Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 27Uehara T. Kaneko M. Tanaka S. Okuma Y. Nomura Y.

Multiple human tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were hybridized for 16 h at 42 °C using the ubiquilin cDNA probe labeled with [32P]dCTP. Filters were washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS for 15 min at room temperature and in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 68 °C. The levels of ubiquilin mRNA were analyzed using a FUJI BAS 2000. Human CCF-STTG1 astrocytoma cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-ubiquilin, GFP-fused ubiquilin (GFP-ubiquilin), and PDI-HA using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, permeabilized for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and then incubated for 1 h in 10% normal blocking serum. Cells were treated with anti-FLAG M5 monoclonal antibody, anti-GFP monoclonal antibody, and/or anti-HA polyclonal (1:100 dilution) for 1 h. After the wash, the cells were incubated with anti-mouse antibody conjugated with Alexa 488 and/or anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with Alexa 594 (1:200 dilution) for 1 h. All images were taken on a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Total RNA was isolated from CCF-STTG1 or SK-N-MC cells using guanidium/cesium chloride as described previously (6Tanaka S. Uehara T. Nomura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10388-10393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The primers used were as follows: ubiquilin upstream primer, 5′-AAATAACTGAAAACCCACAA; ubiquilin downstream primer, 5′-CTGCTGAATAAACTGCTGATG; CHOP upstream primer, 5′-AGCTGAGTCATTGCCTTTCT-3′; CHOP downstream primer, 5′-CTGGTTCTCCCTTGGTCTTC-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase upstream primer, 5′-AAACCCATCACCATCTTCCAG; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase downstream primer, 5′-AGGGGCCATCCACAGTCTTCT. For the DNA fragmentation assay, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 27,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated with 40 μg/ml proteinase K for 30 min at 37 °C and extracted with equal volumes of phenol, phenol/chloroform (1:1 v/v), and chloroform. The DNA was precipitated from the supernatants with a 1/10 volume of 3m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 2 volumes of ethanol and treated with 40 μg/ml RNase A for 1 h at 37 °C. The recovered DNA was then analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Cell viability was estimated by two methods (6Tanaka S. Uehara T. Nomura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10388-10393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Initially, viability was measured by counting the stained viable cells for β-galactosidase activity derived from transfection of that gene. Briefly, 0.3 μg of lacZ plus 1.25 μg of each gene were co-transfected into SK-N-MC cells using the transfection reagent SuperFect (Qiagen) and incubated for 24 h. After hypoxic challenge, cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde for 10 min, rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and stained in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) buffer (0.5 mg/ml X-gal, 4 mmK4[Fe(CN)6], 4 mmK3[Fe(CN)6], 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) at 37 °C for 2 h. The number of stained blue cells in cultures challenged by hypoxiaversus that in normoxic cultures was counted by two investigators blind to the experimental treatments, and the results are expressed as the percentage of hypoxia/normoxia. As another strategy, the viability was estimated by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage method using a cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. LDH activity was measured as the optimal density at 492 nm, and LDH leakage (%) was defined as the ratio of LDH activity in the culture medium to the total activity (% = (extracellular activity)/(extracellular activity + remaining cellular activity)). To identify the proteins interacting with PDI, we performed a yeast two-hybrid library screening using full-length PDI as bait. Approximately 1 × 107 independent clones in the human kidney cDNA expression library were screened on selective medium, and then the β-galactosidase assay was performed to eliminate false positives. Several independent clones were isolated as determined by activation of reporter genes. Sequence analysis demonstrated that a clone was identical to ubiquilin and the remaining five clones were unknown proteins. The interaction between ubiquilin and PDI was analyzed precisely by the yeast two-hybrid assay. Ubiquilin is composed of at least four domains (a ubiquitin-like (UB) region, two Asn-Pro repeat regions, and a ubiquitin-associated region) (Fig.1 A). To determine the PDI-binding region of ubiquilin, various deletion constructs fused to GAL4 were used for the two-hybrid assay with full-length PDI as bait. The wild-type ubiquilin, 1–535, 1–420, and 318–535 mutants bound to PDI, whereas the N-terminal-(1–317) half-fragment spanning amino acids of ubiquilin did not (Fig. 1 A). Next, we evaluated the ubiquilin-binding region of PDI using the yeast two-hybrid system. PDI is composed of at least three domains (two thioredoxin-like regions (a and a′), two unknown regions (b and b′), and a putative Ca2+-binding region (C)). As shown in Fig.1 B, PDI interacted specifically with ubiquilin through its C-terminal-(441–509) containing the putative Ca2+-binding region. To examine ubiquilin mRNA expression in different tissues, we performed Northern blotting analysis using a radioactive probe corresponding to full-length ubiquilin cDNA. This probe detected a major transcript of ∼4.5-kb in all human tissues. Particularly, high levels of ubiquilin mRNA expression were seen in the adult heart, brain, and placenta, and in fetal brain, liver, lung, and kidney (Fig. 2). To confirm whether PDI interacts with ubiquilin, we performed bothin vitro pull-down assay and co-immunoprecipitations using lysates in mammalian cells transfected with PDI and ubiquilin. Cell lysates were incubated with GST or GST fused with ubiquilin, and PDI was detected in proteins eluted from the beads binding to GST-ubiquilin but not from those binding to GST alone (Fig. 2 A). To determine whether the interaction between PDI and ubiquilin occursin vivo, SK-N-MC cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-ubiquilin together with PDI-HA. Western blotting analysis showed that PDI-HA and FLAG-ubiquilin were expressed in each transfectant (Fig. 2 B). Whole cell lysates immunoprecipitated with control IgG, anti-FLAG mAb, or anti-HA pAb were then analyzed by Western blotting using HA or FLAG antibody. As show in Fig.2 B, PDI-HA protein was detected in immunoprecipitates with anti-FLAG from cells co-transfected with PDI-HA and FLAG-ubiquilin. FLAG-ubiquilin protein was also detected in immunoprecipitates with anti-HA. PDI has been reported to be localized specifically in the lumen of the ER. Based on the above observations, we speculated that ubiquilin was at least partly localized in the ER. To determine the cellular localizations of PDI and ubiquilin, expression vectors for GFP- or FLAG-ubiquilin and PDI-HA were transfected into human CCF-STTG1 cells. Two days after transfection, the cells were treated with anti-GFP or FLAG and anti-HA antibody, and the proteins were stained by the Alexa 488- and Alexa 594-conjugated second antibodies. On indirect immunofluorescence labeling of GFP/FLAG-ubiquilin, both GFP-ubiquilin and FLAG-ubiquilin (green) were mainly observed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3 C). In addition, localization of ubiquilin (green) was completely coincidental with those of PDI (red) and calreticulin (red) as an ER marker in the cytoplasm as shown by theyellow color (Fig. 3 C). These results,i.e. the perinuclear staining and peripheral lace-like network, suggested that overexpressed ubiquilin may be associated with the ER. We demonstrated previously that PDI is up-regulated in response to hypoxia in astrocytes (6Tanaka S. Uehara T. Nomura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10388-10393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether ubiquilin is also induced by hypoxic stress in astrocytes. Using anti-ubiquilin IgG raised against the N-terminal synthetic peptide, immunoblotting studies were performed on lysates of cultured human CCF-STTG1 astrocytes exposed to hypoxia and hypoxia followed by reoxygenation. Ubiquilin was not detected or was detected only at a very low level in astrocytes in the quiescent state, was detected 12 h after hypoxia, and the level continued to increase at least 48 h. There were no significant changes in cell viability during this period (data not shown). Following replacement of hypoxic cultures into the normoxic environment, the intensity of the ubiquilin band decreased gradually (Fig. 4 A). We next investigated whether this phenomenon was accompanied with an increase in mRNA induction (Fig. 4 B). Hypoxia-inducedubiquilin mRNA expression was detected at 12 h after hypoxia and was sustained for 12 h after reoxygenation, decreasing gradually thereafter. As up-regulation of the endogenous ubiquilin in response to hypoxia was detected by immunoblotting, we attempted to elucidate the subcellular localization of ubiquilin by indirect fluorescent immunocytochemistry. Under normoxic conditions, immunostaining of astrocytes with anti-ubiquilin and anti-PDI antibodies showed little and slight staining, respectively (Fig.4 C), consistent with the protein levels observed by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 4 B). Immunofluorescent staining of up-regulated endogenous ubiquilin revealed bright perinuclear staining as well as peripheral stained structures (Fig. 4 C). The pattern was reminiscent of the ER staining. In addition, we assessed the co-localization of ubiquilin and PDI, a marker protein of the ER. The pattern of immunoreactivity with anti-PDI antibody was nearly identical to that with anti-ubiquilin antibody as shown by the yellow signal (Fig. 4 C). Previously, we reported that up-regulated PDI has a protective effect against the loss of cell viability induced by hypoxia (6Tanaka S. Uehara T. Nomura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10388-10393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that ubiquilin may also have a protective role against hypoxic stress. Initially, we established transfectants that stably expressed ubiquilin in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. As shown in Fig. 5 A, hypoxia resulted in DNA ladder formation in mock-transfected SH-SY5Y cells. However, there was little fragmentation by hypoxia in ubiquilin-transfected cells. Interestingly, overexpression of ubiquilin showed a protective effect against apoptosis induced by only hypoxia, but not other apoptosis inducers such as NOC18 (a nitric oxide donor) and staurosporine (Fig. 5 B). In addition, we examined whether co-expression of PDI and ubiquilin in neuronal cells has an additive effect on hypoxia-induced loss of cell viability. As shown in Fig. 5 C, co-expression of both ubiquilin and PDI rendered the cells more resistant against hypoxia than cells expressing either ubiquilin or PDI alone. It is well known that CHOP (a C/EBP homolog) is induced by several ER stresses and plays a critical role in cell death. We examined the effects of ubiquilin and PDI on ER stress-induced CHOP induction in neuronal cells. In mock-transfected SK-N-MC cells, kinetic analysis revealed that CHOP mRNA was detectable after 24 h of hypoxia treatment, and the high level of this induction was sustained for up to 36 h. On treatment with hypoxic stress, the loss of cell viability was observed after 24 h coincident with the time course of CHOP induction. After 36 h of stress treatment, the cells were mostly nonviable (Fig.6). In contrast, the CHOPinduction by hypoxia was selectively delayed in ubiquilin- or PDI-overexpressed neuronal cells. In particular, the induction was not detected for up to 36 or 24 h in ubiquilin- or PDI-transfected cells, respectively. At these time points, ubiquilin and PDI significantly attenuated the loss of cell viability. These results suggested that ubiquilin inhibits ER stress-induced neuronal cell death via attenuation of CHOP induction. The aim of this study was to isolate and identify proteins capable of interacting with PDI because we have reported previously that PDI up-regulated by hypoxia/brain ischemia may be involved in the acquisition of tolerance against these stresses. In the present study, we carried out yeast two-hybrid screening to isolate proteins and consequently characterized an interaction between PDI and ubiquilin. This interaction was possibly mediated via the asparagine-proline (NP) repeat region in the C terminus (residues 365–476) of ubiquilin and the C terminus (residues 441–509) of PDI containing a putative Ca2+-binding region (Fig. 1). Ubiquilin has sequence similarities to a region of ubiquitin in its N terminus and to the yeast protein Dsk2, Xenopus protein XDRP1, mouse protein PLIC-1/DA41, PLIC-2, and mouse protein UBIN (29Mah A.

All of these proteins possess a well conserved ubiquitin-like domain at their N termini and ubiquitin-associated domain at their C termini, suggesting that both are involved in targeting and degradation of proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2082952854,"Associated with the metastatic progression of epithelial tumors is the dynamic regulation of cadherins. Whereas E-cadherin is expressed in most epithelium and carcinomas, recent studies suggest that the up-regulation of other cadherin subtypes in carcinomas, such as N-cadherin, may function in cancer progression. We demonstrate that a signal transduction cascade links the N-cadherin·catenin adhesion complex to up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. In suspension, aggregates of DU-145 cells, an E-cadherin expressing human prostate carcinoma line, survive loss of integrin-dependent adhesion by a different anti-apoptotic signaling pathway than the N-cadherin expressing lines PC3 and PC3N. N-cadherin intercellular adhesion mediates a 3.5-fold increase in Bcl-2 protein expression, whereas the level of the proapoptotic protein Bax remains constant. Only N-cadherin ligation in PC3 cells, which express both N-cadherin and E-cadherin, is sufficient to induce activation of Akt/protein kinase B. N-cadherin homophilic ligation initiates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent activation of Akt resulting in Akt phosphorylation of Bad on serine 136. Following N-cadherin homophilic adhesion phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was identified in immunoprecipitates of the N-cadherin·catenin complex. The recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the adhesion complex is dependent on ligation of N-cadherin and an organized actin cytoskeleton because cytochalasin D blocks the recruitment. We propose that N-cadherin homophilic adhesion can initiate anti-apoptotic signaling, which enhances the Akt cell survival pathway in metastatic cancer. Associated with the metastatic progression of epithelial tumors is the dynamic regulation of cadherins. Whereas E-cadherin is expressed in most epithelium and carcinomas, recent studies suggest that the up-regulation of other cadherin subtypes in carcinomas, such as N-cadherin, may function in cancer progression. We demonstrate that a signal transduction cascade links the N-cadherin·catenin adhesion complex to up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. In suspension, aggregates of DU-145 cells, an E-cadherin expressing human prostate carcinoma line, survive loss of integrin-dependent adhesion by a different anti-apoptotic signaling pathway than the N-cadherin expressing lines PC3 and PC3N.

We propose that N-cadherin homophilic adhesion can initiate anti-apoptotic signaling, which enhances the Akt cell survival pathway in metastatic cancer. phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase glutathioneS-transferase poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase hemagglutinin epidermal growth factor N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium salt bovine serum albumin phosphate-buffered saline 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid Cadherins are transmembrane cell-cell adhesion receptors, which have important functional roles in mediating cell segregation during embryonic development and in maintenance of adult tissue integrity (1Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). Functional cell adhesion by cadherin subtypes requires both the coordinated homophilic binding of the extracellular domain and the cadherin cytoplasmic domain with the actin cytoskeleton (2Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Calcium binds to the cadherin extracellular domain inducing a conformation that initiates and stabilizes the homophilic binding of cadherin subtypes on adjacent cells (3Troyanovsky R.B.

Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The conserved cadherin cytoplasmic domain is associated with a lateral network of actin filaments through the catenins (5Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Either β-catenin or γ-catenin binds the complex to α-catenin, which either interacts directly with peripheral actin filaments, or indirectly through actin-associated proteins, such as vinculin or α-actinin (6Hazan R.B.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). In addition, p120ctn binds to a separate site in the juxtamembrane region of cadherins and controls the strength of cadherin-mediated adhesion (8Yap A.S. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar).Although the classical cadherin subtypes and the catenins lack enzymatic activity, they can associate with kinases and phosphatases, such as Fer and PTP1B, in adheren junctions (9Tsukita S. Oishi K. Akiyama T. Yamanashi Y. Yamamoto T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 867-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 10Arregui C. Pathre P. Lilien J. Balsamo J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1263-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Homophilic E-cadherin adhesion initiates the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)1followed by downstream activation of Akt/protein kinase B (11Pece S. Chiariello M. Murga C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 6708-6718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The serine/threonine kinase Akt is an important regulator of metabolic pathways, as well as, apoptotic pathways. Akt is activated in response to diverse extracellular stimuli, such as EGF and other growth factors and integrin adhesion to matrix (13Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). Akt kinase activity is regulated by PI 3-kinase at the plasma membrane through the production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-biphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate, which bind to the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt altering its conformation. For full activation, Akt requires phosphorylation on threonine 308 (Thr-308) and serine 473 (Ser-473) by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (14Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 2/integrin-linked kinase (15Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Thr-308 occurs when Akt is recruited to the membrane, but is not sufficient for activation of kinase activity, which requires phosphorylation of Ser-473 (16Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar). Activated Akt can phosphorylate several substrates that result in suppression of apoptosis (13Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar).Upon exposure to apoptotic signals, it is proposed that cell fate is determined by the relative balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic protein interactions of the Bcl-2 family (17Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). Members of this family include the pro-apoptotic proteins Bad, Bik, Bid, and the anti-apoptotic cell survival proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (18Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4779) Google Scholar). Whereas homodimers of Bcl-2 in the mitochondrial membrane prevent the activation of caspase-9, heterodimerization of Bcl-2 and Bad induces the activation of caspase-9 and initiates an irreversible pathway (19Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One mechanism by which Akt prevents apoptosis is through the phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad. Akt phosphorylates Bad on Ser-136, which inhibits the heterodimer formation of Bad and Bcl-2 in the mitochondrial membrane (20Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S., Fu, H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4914) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Bad is sequestered in the cytoplasm by interacting with 14-3-3 scaffolding proteins, which in turn suppresses apoptosis (21Masters S.C. Yang H. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Fu H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).Among the alterations that facilitate prostate cancer progression are changes in cell adhesion molecule expression along with the increased resistance to apoptosis (22Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2410-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). E-cadherin is essential for adhesion of glandular epithelial cells to each other, and homophilic cell-cell adhesion results in the formation of adheren junctions, which in turn regulates differentiation, growth, and survival within the tissue microenvironment (23Boudreau N. Bissell M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 640-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 24Vallorosi C.J. Day K.C. Zhao X. Rashid M.G. Rubin M.A. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. Day M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3328-3334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Decreased expression of E-cadherin is an important factor in the regulation of carcinoma invasiveness and metastasis (25Birchmeier W. Behrens J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). The dysregulation of cell adhesion in prostate cancer metastasis is, in part, facilitated by the gain in expression of nonepithelial cadherins and members of the integrin family (26Cress A.E. Rabinovitz I. Zhu W. Nagle R.B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). N-cadherin is up-regulated in dedifferentiated, invasive prostate carcinomas (27Tran N.L. Nagle R.B. Cress A.E. Heimark R.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 28Bussemakers M.J. Van Bokhoven A. Tomita K. Jansen C.F. Schalken J.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and N-cadherin expression is reported to induce a motile scattered phenotype in breast carcinoma cells (29Hazan R.B. Phillips G.R. Qiao R.F. Norton L. Aaronson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) and squamous cell carcinomas (30Islam S. Carey T.E. Wolf G.T. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1643-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar).Evidence indicates that disruption of cadherin adhesion can initiate apoptosis in both normal and cancer cells (31Hermiston M.L. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 32Kantak S.S. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16953-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) similar to the inhibition of integrin adhesion to extracellular matrix (33Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). Several studies have partly delineated the molecular mechanisms that link integrin-mediated signal transduction pathways to the intracellular apoptotic machinery, but the mechanism whereby cadherin adhesion contributes to cell survival is poorly understood. To test the importance of cadherin subtypes in cell survival, we examined the homophilic ligation of cadherins on the phosphorylation and activation of Akt. Increased Akt activity has been implicated in prostate tumor progression androgen independence (34Graff J.R. Konicek B.W. McNulty A.M. Wang Z. Houck K. Allen S. Paul J.D. Hbaiu A. Goode R.G. Sandusky G.E. Vessella R.L. Neubauer B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24500-24505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that the anti-apoptotic effects of N-cadherin in prostate carcinomas depend on its ability to recruit PI 3-kinase to the N-cadherin·catenin·actin complex and results in an increased Bcl-2/Bax protein level. Overexpression of Bcl-2 has been observed in androgen-independent prostate adenocarcinomas, which correlated with the presence of metastases (35Colombel M. Symmans F. Gil S. O'Toole K.M. Chopin D. Benson M. Olsson C.A. Korsmeyer S. Buttyan R. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 390-400PubMed Google Scholar, 36Krajewska M. Krajewski S. Epstein J.I. Shabaik A. Sauvageot J. Song K. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1567-1576PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that the gain of N-cadherin expression by prostate carcinomas in advanced stages of metastasis may be an inhibitor of apoptosis through stabilization of Bcl-2.DISCUSSIONThe studies presented here suggest new insights into the function and interaction of the cadherin subtypes, E-cadherin and N-cadherin. Our data indicates that N-cadherin has dual functional roles in the regulation of apoptosis and in homophilic cell-cell adhesion. Genetic studies have also demonstrated a dual role for N-cadherin in null mouse embryos where populations of neural cells in the homozygous null embryos were apoptotic and myocardium was disorganized but not apoptotic (52Luo Y. Ferreira-Cornwell M. Baldwin H. Kostetskii I. Lenox J. Lieberman M. Radice G. Dev. Suppl. 2001; 128: 459-469Google Scholar). We found that N-cadherin homophilic adhesion in prostate carcinoma cells is linked to Akt signaling and inhibition of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins affect mitochondrial function and regulate the release of apoptosis-activating factors (18Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4779) Google Scholar). Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members act to preserve mitochondrial integrity by suppressing the release of cytochrome c. The clustering of N-cadherin extracellular domains between adjacent PC3N cells leads to organization of actin cytoskeletal structure and provides specific outside-in signals that regulate the steady state level of Bcl-2. Inhibition of homophilic binding of the N-cadherin extracellular domain correlates with decreased cellular levels of activated Akt and Bcl-2 protein expression. Cadherin engagement between adjacent cells has an essential role in the recruitment of the actin cytoskeleton to the adherens junction complex and regulation of actin polymerization (12Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6708-6718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 49Adams C.L. Chen Y.T. Smith S.J. Nelson W.J. J.

Cell. 2000; 100: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). We identified that formation of the adherens junction complex leads to the recruitment and activation of PI 3-kinase and phosphorylation of Akt. Subsequent activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway leads to phosphorylation of Bad at Ser-136 and stabilization of Bcl-2. The cytoprotective effects of Bcl-2 are in part through the inhibition of formation of Bax homodimers in the mitochondrial outer membrane (53Mikhailov V. Mikhailova M. Pulkrabek D.J. Dong Z. Venkatachalam M.A. Saikumar P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18361-18374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar).In previous studies (11Pece S. Chiariello M. Murga C. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19347-19351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 12Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6708-6718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) E-cadherin ligation has been implicated in the regulation of PI 3-kinase and the localized production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate that initiates phosphorylation of Akt. Thus, both E-cadherin and N-cadherin have the potential to activate Akt signaling pathways. In a prostate carcinoma cell line, which expresses both E-cadherin and N-cadherin, our results using an antibody immobilization assay to ligate cadherin subtypes with specific antibodies show that only N-cadherin leads to phosphorylation of Akt. Ligation of E-cadherin in PC-3 cells under the same conditions failed to activate Akt (Ser-473 phosphorylation). In prostate carcinomas, E-cadherin adhesion can prevent apoptosis in suspension, however, this is through a survival mechanism controlling retinoblastoma activation and G1 arrest (41Day M.L. Zhao X. Vallorosi C.J. Putzi M. Powell C.T. Lin C. Day K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9656-9664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Results from studies by Laure et al. (54Larue L. Antos C. Butz S. Huber O. Delmas V. Dominis M. Kemler R. Dev. Suppl. 1996; 122: 3185-3194Google Scholar) indicate that cadherin subtypes are directly involved in the differentiation of different tissue types suggesting that cadherins influence specific signal tranduction pathways regulating gene expression activity. Taken together these results suggest that the outside-in signaling of cadherin subtypes depends on their expression in a cellular context.Evidence suggests that following cellular attachment the suppression of apoptosis is not mediated solely by integrin-mediated adhesion to extracellular matrix but, rather, by the ability of the cells to spread and adopt an optimal cell shape (55Chen C.S. Mrksich M. Huang S. Whitesides G.M. Ingber D.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1425-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4144) Google Scholar). Cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is an additional mechanism to control cell shape and organization of the cytoskeleton. Formation of intercellular adherens junctions is a dynamic process that involves actin reorganization and polymerization initiated by cadherin adhesion (50Vasioukhin V. Bauer C. Yin M. Fuchs E. Cell. 2000; 100: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar,56Drubin D.G. Nelson W.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 335-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Cadherin homophilic binding initiates clustering of the extracellular domains, and interaction of the cytoplasmic domain with the actin cytoskeleton is an important mechanism to strengthen the weak forces provided by homophilic binding (57Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Pruschy M. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 308-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Association of the N-cadherin·catenin·vinculin complexes in PC3 cells with the peripheral actin cytoskeleton provides sites for attachment of the cytoskeleton at the membrane, which are important for the development of mechanical stress during epithelial polarization and control of cell shape (56Drubin D.G. Nelson W.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 335-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). This cadherin-mediated interaction also transmits signals from the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton, ranging from activation of the Rho family of small GTPases (58Braga V.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 59Noren N.K. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. Burridge K. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) to production of phosphoinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (61Sechi A.S. Wehland J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113, Part 21: 3685-3695Google Scholar), which can regulate actin cytoskeleton organization. Homophilic E-cadherin ligation activates the GTPases Cdc42 and Rac, which regulates actin cytoskeletal rearrangement and can modulate cadherin function (58Braga V.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar,62Kim S.H., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The PI 3-kinase product phosphoinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate is required for the activation and recruitment of exchange factors for the GTPases such as Tiam-1, which is required for epithelial adherens junction formation (64Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The survival signals initiated by integrin adhesion activate specific pathways that converge on the activation of Akt (65Giancotti F.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 691-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), in addition to the activation of other molecular mechanisms that inhibit apoptosis (66Stromblad S. Becker J.C. Yebra M. Brooks P.C. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Thus, our results suggest an overlap in the cell survival signal transduction cascades that are stimulated by integrin adhesion to extracellular matrix, and intercellular adhesion by N-cadherin.Following homophilic ligation of N-cadherin, our observations show that an intact actin cytoskeleton with the N-cadherin·catenin complex recruits PI 3-kinase. In addition to the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton at the membrane by N-cadherin engagement, Lambert et al. (46Lambert M. Padilla F. Mege R.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2207-2219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that local accumulation of N-cadherin signaling complexes result in tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in the adhesion complex. These tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins apparently serve as binding sites for the two Src homology 2 domains of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase to the cadherin·catenin complex. The major role of the p85 Src homology 2 domain is to mediate tyrosine kinase-dependent regulation of PI 3-kinase by increasing the catalytic activity of the p110 and recruitment of PI 3-kinase to the signaling complex (67Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: M11-M16PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase has been identified to tyrosine-phosphorylated cytosolic and cadherin-associated β-catenin (68Woodfield R.J. Hodgkin M.N. Akhtar N. Morse M.A. Fuller K.J. Saqib K. Thompson N.T. Wakelam M.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The activation and autophosphorylation of EGF receptor by EGF elicits remodeling of actin (69Chan A.Y. Raft S. Bailly M. Wyckoff J.B. Segall J.E. Condeelis J.S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 199-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which initiates the formation of lamellipodia (70Hill K. Welti S., Yu, J. Murray J.T. Yip S.C. Condeelis J.S. Segall J.E. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3741-3744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and requires the activity of PI 3-kinase. Distinct signaling properties for the class I isoforms of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase have been demonstrated (71Vanhaesebroeck B. Jones G.E. Allen W.E. Zicha D. Hooshmand-Rad R. Sawyer C. Wells C. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). EGF-stimulated lamellipodia extension was shown to be a function of the α isoform and not the β isoform of the catalytic subunit (70Hill K. Welti S., Yu, J. Murray J.T. Yip S.C. Condeelis J.S. Segall J.E. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3741-3744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), although both p110 catalytic subunits are capable of leading to downstream Akt activation (72Kurosu H.K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The differential utilization of the p110 isoforms could reflect the specific signaling properties that distinguish between the N-cadherin and EGF receptor signal transduction complexes.Because the protein and lipid phosphatase PTEN is a negative regulator of the PI 3-kinase pathway and is lost in advanced prostate cancer (73Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penninger J.M. Siderovski D.P. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar), tumor progression is likely to be associated with increased responsiveness to extracellular signals, such as from cadherin adhesion that activates the PI 3-kinase pathway. Our studies show that the level of Bcl-2 protein expression is enhanced inPTEN negative prostate carcinoma cell lines that form N-cadherin-mediated adherens junctions. The association of PI 3-kinase with the N-cadherin·catenin complex was transient even though PC3 cells are deficient in PTEN.Tyrosine phosphatases, such as PTP1B (10Arregui C. Pathre P. Lilien J. Balsamo J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1263-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), are also associated with the N-cadherin·catenin adhesion complex and potentially function to reduce PI 3-kinase binding. We observed that following N-cadherin ligation, Akt translocated from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm and then to the nucleus (data not shown), and returned to a basal level of phosphorylation by 24 h suggesting action of a phosphatase, such as PP2A.Altogether our results suggest a potential mechanism where N-cadherin adhesion can contribute to the regulation of apoptosis in carcinoma cells. Several studies have shown that regulation of apoptosis by the Bcl-2 family of proteins involves regulation of the mitochondrial outer membrane integrity (18Adams J.M. Cory S.

In the unphosphorylated state Bad can form heterodimers with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologs and promotes cell death by allowing Bax-Bax homo-oligomers in the mitochondrial membrane.

During apoptosis the activation of caspases is a critical step and may contribute to the loss of anti-apoptotic signaling from cadherins because many of the substrates of caspases have been shown to be components of adherens junctions including plakoglobin, β-catenin, and E-cadherin (24Vallorosi C.J.

Thus these new insights into the function of the cadherin survival signaling pathway may provide new approaches for the therapeutic treatment of uncontrolled growth and metastasis of prostate cancer cells.

Functional cell adhesion by cadherin subtypes requires both the coordinated homophilic binding of the extracellular domain and the cadherin cytoplasmic domain with the actin cytoskeleton (2Yap A.S.

Apoptotic cell death is a process characterized by cell shrinkage, loss of membrane integrity, DNA fragmentation, and formation of apoptotic bodies (24Green D.R. Cell. 2000; 102: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). The key apoptotic effectors in mammals are a family of cysteine-containing, aspartate-specific proteases called caspases (25Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). One important issue to be elucidated concerns the mechanism of activation of the caspase cascades. Yang et al.(26Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) reported that activating the signaling complex at the CD-95 (Fas/Apo-1) receptor leads to the autoproteolytic activating of caspase 8.

Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar) have identified events in apoptosis involving the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Recently, Stewart et al. (28Stewart S.A. Poon B. Song J.Y. Chen I.S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3105-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) reported that in vitro HIV-1 Vpr induced apoptosis and activation of caspase 3 suggesting that HIV utilized one of the major pathways of apoptosis. Recently, Jocototet al. (17Jacotot E. Ravagnan L. Loeffler M. Ferri K.F. Vieira H.L. Zamzami N. Costantini P. Druillennec S. Hoebeke J. Briand J.P. Irinopoulou T. Daugas E. Susin S.A. Cointe D. Xie Z.H. Reed J.C. Roques B.P. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 3: 33-46Crossref Scopus (401) Google Scholar) reported that isolated HIV-1 Vpr protein when added to isolated intact mitochondria dissipate/neutralizes their membrane potential. However, it remains to be clarified through what pathway(s) HIV-1 Vpr as part of infectious virions induces apoptosis in primary cells.The aims of the present study were, therefore, first to investigate the mechanism of apoptosis induced by HIV-1 Vpr in primary PBMCs and T-cells. To achieve this goal we used a HIV-1 pseudotype system and a novel adenoviral system that we developed to express HIV-1 Vpr or recombinant Vpr. We found that viral borne HIV-1 Vpr induces apoptosis in PBMCs as well as T-cells. Apoptosis was coincident with mitochondrial depolarization and activation of the caspase 9 pathway resulting in caspase 3 activation and the downstream effects of apoptosis. The caspase 8 pathway was not involved, demonstrating a lack of involvement of the Fas/FADD pathway. These findings have important implications for our understanding of Vpr-induced pathogenesis.DISCUSSIONThe loss of functional immune cells is a hallmark of AIDS. Induction of apoptosis following viral infection of a cell is generally viewed as an attempt by the host cell to limit virus replication. In fact, many viruses carry their own anti-apoptotic genes or up-regulate anti-apotoptic cellular genes, which can block the premature death of infected cells. This strategy facilitates a persistent infection or prolongs the survival of infected cells to maximize the production of viral progeny. On the other hand, it has also been suggested that apoptotic cell death may be part of the cycle of HIV-1 replication. Thus, like other animal viruses, HIV-1 may have developed strategies to modulate the apoptotic cell death of its target cells. Research into the biology of the accessory genes of HIV-1 constitutes an active area of investigation. The vpraccessory gene is a potent regulator of the host cell. One dramatic function of Vpr is its effect on host cell proliferation, which results in transcription changes in host cells (35Levy D.N Fernandes L.S. Williams W.V. Weiner D.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This growth arrest occurs in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (6Boon B. Grovit-ferbas K. Stewart S.A. Chen I.S.Y. Science. 1998; 281: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 7Emerman M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1096-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 10Stewart S.A.

Virol. 1995; 69: 6705-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Cell cycle arrest may be at least temporally linked to the induction of apoptosis (10Stewart S.A. Poon B. Jowet J.B.M. Chen I.S.Y. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5579-5592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The apoptotic cascade induced by Vpr is not understood in detail; however, recent studies have helped to provide a scaffold of information for consideration. Stewart et al. (28Stewart S.A. Poon B. Song J.Y. Chen I.S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3105-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) have reported that Vpr activates caspase 3. The relationship of this downstream activator of apoptosis and Vpr biology requires further work. Most recently, by studying Vpr as a free protein, a direct effect on isolated mitochondria was observed, and protein Vpr induced mitochondria destabilization resulting in the induction of the apoptotic cascade in vitro (17Jacotot E. Ravagnan L. Loeffler M. Ferri K.F. Vieira H.L. Zamzami N. Costantini P. Druillennec S. Hoebeke J. Briand J.P. Irinopoulou T. Daugas E. Susin S.A. Cointe D. Xie Z.H. Reed J.C. Roques B.P. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 3: 33-46Crossref Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 39Jacotot E. Ferri K., El Hamel C. Brenner C. Druillennec S. Hoebeke J. Rustin P. Metivier D. Lenoir C. Geuskens M. Vieira H.

However, these studies did not test the effects of viral borne Vpr on primary cells that are the actual targets of HIV infection. Furthermore, the link between caspase 3 activation and the destabilization of the mitochondrial pathway by either of the upstream caspase pathways 8 or 9 was not determined. Finally analysis of the direct relationships between Vpr cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, caspase activation, and mitochondrial destabilization in primary lymphocytes by viral borne Vpr has not been investigated previously.Accordingly, we first directly tested caspase activation induced by viral delivered HIV-1 Vpr in PBMCs. We delivered Vpr protein into target cells by infection using pseudotyped viruses. Compared with previous transfection studies, the infection model more closely resembles the natural process in which Gag-associated protein Vpr and other viral proteins as well as genomic RNA are introduced into target cells. In addition, infection allows delivery of viral proteins into cells that are difficult to transfect, such as human PMBCs.There are two major pathways for induction of apoptosis, the Fas-Fas ligand pathway and the mitochondrial pathway. In both cases, a hallmark and downstream target of both of these apoptotic pathways is the activation of caspase 3. Therefore, we examined caspase 3 activation in cells infected with pseudotyped viruses that carry Vprwt or Vpr−. In cells infected with virions that carry Vprwt, caspase 3 was dramatically elevated. These data confirmed a prior study which illustrated that HIV-1 Vpr apoptosis involves activation specifically of caspase 3 (28Stewart S.A. Poon B. Song J.Y. Chen I.S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3105-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We subsequently tested both caspase 8 and caspase 9 activity. Caspase 8 activity is a downstream indicator of activation of the Fas-Fas ligand apoptotic pathway, whereas caspase 9 is a downstream indicator of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. We found that infection Vprwt or Vpr− viruses failed to induce caspase 8 activity. This suggested that in PBMCs HIV-1 Vpr-induced apoptosis is not through the Fas death receptor pathway. There are several additional links of evidence that collectively illustrate that Vpr acts independently of the caspase 8 Fas/FADD pathway.Some HIV genes including env and nef were reported to activate the CD95 receptor pathway by increasing the CD95 expression or inducing the CD95L. Therefore, we investigated whether this mechanism also involves Vpr. Flow cytometric analysis of infected cells neither increased CD95 expression nor induced CD95L. In addition, these results were further corroborated using the antagonistic anti-CD95 antibody ZB4. Preincubation with this antibody blocked CD95L-induced apoptosis, whereas Vpr-mediated cell death was unaffected. Finally we tested the ability of Vpr to induce apoptosis of a Fas/FADD-deficient cell line SW480 (40Suzuki A. Obata S. Hayashida M. Kawano H. Nakano T. Shiraki K. Nat. Med. 2000; 7: 88-93Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). SW480 was effectively induced to undergo apoptosis by Vpr. Thus, Vpr is able to trigger apoptosis independent of the CD95 receptor pathway.Besides the caspase cascades initiated by death receptors, another cascade that is essentially controlled by mitochondria is also important in apoptosis. The natural pro-caspase 9 activation pathways involve the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which form a complex with Apaf-1. The complex that activates the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway consists of cytochrome creleased from the mitochondria (Apaf-2), the human homolog of Ced-4 (Apaf-1), and the caspase 9 proenzyme (Casp9) (Apaf-3). The Apaf-1-cytochrome c complex recruits pro-caspase 9 and induces its auto-activation by aggregation (41Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X.

Inhibitors such as XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis), c-IAP-1 (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1), and c-IAP-2 (43Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Van Arsdale T. Zhou Q.

Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7787-7790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) also regulate the activity of caspase 9. Recently, a new protein Smac has been identified that activates the caspase 9 pathway by eliminating IAP inhibition (45Du C. Fang M., Li, Y., Li, L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar). In order to elucidate whether Vpr as a viral protein asserts its apoptotic effect through the mitochondria, or if it by passes mitochondria and acts directly on the downstream pro-caspase 9, we measured the transmembrane potential of the mitochondria during viral infection. The disruption of transmembrane potential, which indicates the disruption of the membrane integrity, is one of the earliest phenomena in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. We observed that HIV-1 viral borne Vpr disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating that Vpr induces apoptosis through mitochondria disruption. By making the mitochondria membrane-permeable, Vpr would facilitate the release of apoptotic proteins such as cytochromec, which ultimately affects caspase 9 and later cleaves caspase 3. During the course of this study, Jocotot et al.(17Jacotot E. Ravagnan L. Loeffler M. Ferri K.F. Vieira H.L. Zamzami N. Costantini P. Druillennec S. Hoebeke J. Briand J.P. Irinopoulou T. Daugas E. Susin S.A. Cointe D. Xie Z.H. Reed J.C. Roques B.P. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 3: 33-46Crossref Scopus (401) Google Scholar) reported that a synthetic Vpr could destabilize isolated purified mitochondria. Here we observed the release of cytochrome cwas induced by Vpr in whole cells, thus extending these original observations.Because the Bcl-2 protein family regulates mitochondrial potential and early apoptotic changes, we have further investigated the expression of Bcl-2 and Vpr-induced apoptosis. Vpr markedly reduced the expression level of Bcl-2 proteins, as assessed by Western blot assay. These proteins inhibit the release of caspases and caspase-activating factors from apoptotic mitochondria (46Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar). However, Bcl-2 overexpression did not inhibit the ability of Vpr to induce apoptosis. This result is interesting as it suggests that either the enhanced breakdown of Bcl-2 or through another mechanism Vpr can overcome this block to apoptosis.In summary, we observe that HIV-1 Vpr induces apoptosis through the caspase 9-dependent mitochondrial pathway in primary immune cells. Vpr as an apoptotic protein targets the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway resulting in its destabilization as follows: release of cytochrome c which likely aggregates Apaf-1 and induces a heightened level of caspase 9 activity, and heightened levels of caspase 3 activity leading ultimately to the autodestruction of infected targets of HIV. Furthermore, investigation into the role of the caspase 9 apoptotic pathway in HIV pathobiology is warranted, as it is interesting to speculate that inhibition of this pathway may be exploited as an approach to novel therapeutics.

To achieve this goal we used a HIV-1 pseudotype system and a novel adenoviral system that we developed to express HIV-1 Vpr or recombinant Vpr. We found that viral borne HIV-1 Vpr induces apoptosis in PBMCs as well as T-cells.

High affinity uptake systems are induced under metal-limiting conditions to maintain an adequate supply of these essential nutrients. Low affinity uptake systems function when their substrates are in greater supply. The FET4 gene encodes a low affinity iron and copper uptake transporter. FET4expression is regulated by several environmental factors. In this report, we describe the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation. First, we found that FET4 expression is induced in iron-limited cells by the Aft1 iron-responsive transcriptional activator. Second, FET4 is regulated by zinc status via the Zap1 transcription factor. We present evidence that FET4 is a physiologically relevant zinc transporter and this provides a rationale for its regulation by Zap1. Finally, FET4expression is regulated in response to oxygen by the Rox1 repressor. Rox1 attenuates activation by Aft1 and Zap1 in aerobic cells. Derepression of FET4 may allow the Fet4 transporter to play an even greater role in metal acquisition under anaerobic conditions. Thus, Fet4 is a multisubstrate metal ion transporter under combinatorial control by iron, zinc, and oxygen.

Chelex-treated synthetic defined medium δ-aminolevulinic acid bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid Combinatorial control of gene expression occurs when a single gene is regulated in response to different signals (1Latchman D.S. Eukaryotic Transcription Factors. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, New York1995Google Scholar). This control is often mediated by the combination of different transcription factor-binding sites in a promoter of the gene and action on those elements by multiple transcriptional activators and/or repressors. Combinatorial control allows expression of a gene to be modulated by multiple signals and this can provide several advantages to a cell or an organism. For example, activity of a particular gene product may be beneficial under a variety of conditions. Alternatively, a gene product may play different roles under different conditions and combinatorial control can allow this to occur as well. Combinatorial control also allows modulation of expression by more than one signal to optimize the expression of a gene to match a particular combination of factors. In this paper, we describe the combinatorial transcriptional regulation of the yeast FET4 gene. FET4 encodes a metal ion transporter and its regulation by multiple signals allows modulation of expression in response to iron, zinc, and oxygen.Metals ions such as iron and zinc are essential nutrients for cells. However, if accumulated to excessive levels, these same elements can be toxic. Therefore, genes encoding the proteins responsible for uptake of metal ions are highly regulated. Metal uptake systems have been well characterized in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2Eide D.J. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2000; 43: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, iron uptake is mediated by several different pathways in this organism. First, yeast can accumulate iron bound to microbial siderophores (3Lesuisse E. Blaiseau P.L. Dancis A. Camadro J.M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although S. cerevisiae does not produce its own siderophores, a number of different transporters can accumulate iron bound by siderophores secreted by other microbes. S. cerevisiae also uses a reductive mechanism for iron uptake. Extracellular Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) by the Fre1 and Fre2 reductases located in the plasma membrane (4Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 5Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The Fe(II) product is then the substrate of a high affinity transport system composed of the Fet3 multicopper oxidase and the Ftr1 permease (6Askwith C. Eide D., Ho, A.V. Bernard P.S., Li, L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 7Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Fet3 uses O2 as a substrate to oxidize Fe(II) back to Fe(III) for subsequent transport by Ftr1 (8DeSilva D.M. Askwith C.C. Eide D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1098-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). High affinity copper uptake is also mediated by a reductive mechanism. Extracellular Cu(II) is reduced to Cu(I) by Fre1 reductase prior to transport across the plasma membrane by the Ctr1 and Ctr3 transporters (9Georgatsou E. Mavrogiannis L.A. Fragiadakis G.S.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1917-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Finally, high affinity zinc transport is mediated by the Zrt1 and Zrt2 proteins (13Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 14Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar).These high affinity uptake systems are tightly regulated in response to the cellular status of their respective metal substrates. Iron-limiting growth conditions trigger increased expression of the genes encoding Fre1, Fre2, Fet3, Ftr1, and many other genes involved in iron acquisition (2Eide D.J. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2000; 43: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This induction is mediated by two related transcription factors, Aft1 and Aft2, that share overlapping but nonidentical sets of target genes (15Blaiseau P.L. Lesuisse E. Camadro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34221-34226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 16Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14322-14327Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In a similar fashion, expression of the ZRT1 and ZRT2 genes is induced under zinc deficiency by the Zap1 transcription factor (17Zhao H. Eide D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and the copper uptake transporters are regulated by the Mac1 copper-responsive activator protein (18Jungmann J. Reins H. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Each of these factors controls their respective target genes by binding to specific sequences in their promoters.In addition to the high affinity systems, low affinity uptake systems for these substrates are also present in yeast. This is evident because mutational inactivation of the high affinity systems does not result in nonviable cells. Previous work identified a low affinity iron transporter encoded by the FET4 gene (19Dix D.R. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26092-26099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dix D. Bridgham J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11770-11777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The Fet4 protein has six predicted membrane spanning regions and is localized to the plasma membrane. In addition to its role in iron transport, Fet4 has also been shown to be a physiologically relevant copper transporter (21Hassett R. Dix D.R. Eide D.J. Kosman D.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Portnoy M.E. Schmidt P.J. Rogers R.S. Culotta V.C. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 265: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Other studies suggested that Fet4 may be capable of transporting cobalt, manganese, and zinc as well (23Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These observations lead us to the hypothesis that Fet4 plays a central role in the accumulation of a number of metal ions in yeast.Various studies have indicated that FET4 expression and/or activity is influenced by a number of environmental factors. First, levels of Fet4 were ∼4-fold higher in iron-deficient cells than in iron-replete cells (20Dix D. Bridgham J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11770-11777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A recent microarray study (24Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) from our laboratory revealed that FET4 transcription was increased under zinc deficiency and that FET4 may be a Zap1 target gene. Finally, another microarray study comparing yeast cells grown in aerobic and anaerobic conditions indicated that FET4mRNA levels were greatly elevated under anaerobiosis (25ter Linde J.J. Liang H. Davis R.W. Steensma H.Y. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7409-7413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggested that FET4 transcription is under combinatorial control and regulated by multiple environmental factors. However, the underlying mechanisms for this regulation were unknown. In this report, we provide an understanding of FET4 regulation at a molecular level. FET4 transcription is subject to regulation by iron status via the Aft1 transcription factor and zinc status via Zap1. We present evidence that Fet4 is a physiologically relevant zinc transporter in yeast and this is likely the reason for its regulation by zinc status. Finally, repression of FET4expression in aerobic cells is mediated by the Rox1 repressor in response to O2 levels. These different regulatory proteins integrate FET4 gene expression with several environmental factors.DISCUSSIONDuring the preparation of this manuscript, Jensen and Culotta (41Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) reported a related analysis of FET4 gene expression. Our studies confirm and extend on their work. We demonstrate here that theFET4 gene is subject to transcriptional regulation in response to iron and zinc status and the presence or absence of O2. These studies also provide an understanding of this regulation at a molecular level. In response to iron- or zinc-limiting growth conditions, FET4 expression is activated by Aft1 or Zap1, respectively. The role of Rox1 is to attenuate iron and zinc responsive expression in aerobic cells and allow derepression in anaerobic conditions. We have not provided evidence here that these proteins directly interact with the FET4 promoter. However, the effects of mutations in the genes encoding these transcription factors on FET4 expression plus the presence and importance of promoter elements similar to their consensus binding sites strongly support a direct role of these factors in regulating FET4transcription.Regulation of FET4 by iron status is easily understood given the importance of the Fet4 protein in iron accumulation (19Dix D.R. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26092-26099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dix D. Bridgham J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11770-11777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Both our results and those of Jensen and Culotta (41Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) indicate thatFET4 is regulated in response to iron status by Aft1. This conclusion is also supported by the work of Li and Kaplan (23Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) who showed that FET4 expression is up-regulated in afet3Δ mutant. Our results indicate that this increase is because of iron limitation imposed by loss of the high affinity iron uptake system. These observations were surprising given that two previous studies addressing FET4 regulation had discounted a role of Aft1. Casas et al. (42Casas C. Aldea M. Espinet C. Gallego C. Gil R. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 621-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) observed thatFET4 mRNA levels were not altered in cells treated with the iron chelator ferrozine, whereas other Aft1 target genes were induced. One possible explanation is that this treatment regimen was not sufficiently iron limiting to elicit a detectable response fromFET4. Also of note in their study (42Casas C. Aldea M. Espinet C. Gallego C. Gil R. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 621-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was thatFET4 mRNA was detected in an aft1Δ mutant, indicating that other factors were involved in its expression. We now know that at least one other positive factor, i.e. Zap1, activates FET4 expression. Intriguingly, Dix et al. (20Dix D. Bridgham J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11770-11777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) noted that the Fet4 protein level and activity were induced ∼4-fold in response to iron limitation. However, a constitutive allele of AFT1,AFT1–1up, did not cause increased Fet4 uptake activity in iron-replete cells. Given that theAFT1–1up allele greatly increasedFET4 mRNA levels in iron-replete cells (41Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), it now seems likely that some form of post-transcriptional regulation of Fet4 activity may occur in response to iron status. Post-translational control of copper (43Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), manganese (44Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4863-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and zinc (45Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 46Gitan R.S. Eide D.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) uptake transporters has already been observed in yeast so this seems a likely prospect.Previous microarray analyses from our laboratory suggested the zinc-responsive control of FET4 transcription by Zap1 (24Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Here we confirm that FET4 expression is increased under zinc-deficient conditions. Most of the increase in FET4expression under zinc limitation was lost in the zap1Δmutant or when the ZRE in the FET4 promoter was mutated. However, there was a residual 2-fold response to zinc deficiency observed in a zap1Δ mutant strain and with aFET4 reporter where the ZRE was mutated. This residual zinc responsiveness may be because of loss of some Rox1 repression in zinc-deficient cells resulting from a possible decrease in heme levels. The second enzyme in heme biosynthesis, ALA dehydratase, is zinc-dependent (47Senior N.M. Brocklehurst K. Cooper J.B. Wood S.P. Erskine P. Shoolingin-Jordan P.M. Thomas P.G. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and in zinc-deficient conditions, this enzyme could conceivably become limiting for heme biosynthesis. It is also attractive to speculate that the iron status of aerobic cells may be communicated to FET4 transcription through effects of iron depletion on heme levels with a resultant decrease in Rox1 repression. However, this does not appear to occur; all iron responsiveness we observed in aerobic cells required Aft1. Iron-deficient aft1Δ mutants did not show residual iron responsiveness as we would expect if heme levels were also used as an indicator of iron status.Regulation of FET4 by Zap1 is now understandable given our new appreciation of the role of Fet4 in zinc uptake. Several of our observations indicate that Fet4 is a relevant pathway for zinc uptake in wild-type cells. Most zinc uptake in aerobically grown yeast is mediated by the Zrt1 and Zrt2 transporters (14Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). However, azrt1Δzrt2Δ double mutant is viable indicating that additional systems of zinc uptake are present and our results suggest that Fet4 is one of those systems. A zrt1Δzrt2Δfet4Δmutant, whereas requiring more zinc to grow than the double mutant, is also viable indicating that still other mechanisms of zinc uptake are present. One possible pathway for zinc accumulation is by fluid-phase endocytosis to the vacuole where the Zrt3 zinc transporter could mediate transport of zinc into the cytoplasm (32MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar).Microarray analysis indicated that FET4 expression was greatly increased in anaerobic cells when compared with cells grown aerobically (25ter Linde J.J. Liang H. Davis R.W. Steensma H.Y. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7409-7413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results are in agreement with this previous study and we further showed that Rox1 is responsible for repressingFET4 expression in aerobic conditions. Loss of Rox1 repression under anaerobiosis results in increased expression ofFET4. In aerobic cells, Rox1 serves to attenuate activation by both of the metal-responsive activators, Aft1 and Zap1, that controlFET4 expression. Rox1 functions by recruiting the Ssn6 and Tup1 repressors to promoters where they block activation by positive factors (38Zitomer R.S. Limbach M.P. Rodriguez-Torres A.M. Balasubramanian B. Deckert J. Snow P.M. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1997; 11: 279-288Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that in Candida albicans, Tup1 regulates iron uptake genes in response to iron status (48Knight S.A.B. Lesuisse E. Stearman R. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, ours is not the first example of these multifunctional transcription repressors acting to control metal ion uptake in fungi.Given that FET4 can contribute to the accumulation of iron and zinc in aerobic cells, the question arises as to whyFET4 is repressed under these conditions. One possible explanation for this repression is that, because Fet4 is relatively nonselective in its metal substrates, metal toxicity may occur by expressing FET4 at high levels in aerobic conditions. Indeed, such an effect was observed in experiments withfet3Δ mutants where FET4 is more highly expressed; fet3Δ mutants have increased sensitivity to cobalt, copper, manganese, and zinc (23Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For cobalt, this increased sensitivity was shown to be dependent on FET4expression. Moreover, Jensen and Culotta (41Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) showed that cells overexpressing FET4 aerobically because of mutation ofROX1 are hypersensitive to cadmium. Thus, repression of the relatively nonspecific Fet4 transporter allows aerobic cells to rely on the more specific high affinity metal uptake systems.If high level Fet4 activity is so dangerous to cells, why then isFET4 expression derepressed in anaerobic cells? One possible explanation is that Fet4 is required under anaerobic conditions to compensate for the loss of Fet3 activity. The high affinity iron uptake system is composed of the Ftr1 transporter and the Fet3 multicopper oxidase. Fet3 activity is oxygen-dependent and the high affinity iron uptake system does not function under anaerobic conditions (8DeSilva D.M. Askwith C.C. Eide D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1098-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). 3D. Kosman, personal communication.Up-regulation of Fet4 in anaerobic cells may be a necessary risk taken by cells to maintain adequate iron accumulation and predicts that Fet4 will play a predominant role in iron accumulation under anaerobic conditions. In support of this hypothesis, Jensen and Culotta (41Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) observed that anaerobically grown fet4Δ mutants accumulated much less iron than wild-type cells. Furthermore, expression of many iron uptake genes including FET3,FTR1, SIT1, and FIT2 was found to be repressed in anaerobic conditions (25ter Linde J.J. Liang H. Davis R.W. Steensma H.Y. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7409-7413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Hassett R.F. Romeo A.M. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7628-7636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This repression, which is mediated through Aft1 (49Hassett R.F. Romeo A.M. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7628-7636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), may result from changes in iron status because of FET4 derepression. An additional reason underlying the increased expression of FET4 under anaerobic conditions may be related to changes in metal toxicity. Under anaerobic conditions, metal ions such as iron and copper are less likely to participate in metal-catalyzed Fenton chemistry that contributes to their toxicity (50Avery S.V. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 2001; 49: 111-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, higher levels of some metals may be more tolerable under conditions of low O2. One scenario that illustrates this point is that zinc-limited anaerobic cells may accumulate more iron and/or copper through Fet4 than would be tolerable under aerobic conditions.Early studies of metal ion transport suggested the existence of a general divalent metal ion uptake system that was responsible for accumulation of many different substrates (51Cooper T.G. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 399-461Google Scholar). With the subsequent characterization of the high affinity systems responsible for the specific uptake of copper (Ctr1 and Ctr3), iron (Fet3/Ftr1), manganese (Smf1), and zinc (Zrt1 and Zrt2), this hypothesis fell from favor. However, with our growing appreciation of the function of Fet4 in the uptake of multiple metal ion substrates, this model gains renewed credibility. We now know that Fet4 is a relevant transporter of iron, copper, and zinc in aerobic cells. Given the even higher levels ofFET4 expression in anaerobic cells, our data and those of others (41Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) argue that Fet4 plays an even greater role in the uptake of multiple metal ions under these conditions. Thus, combinatorial control of FET4 expression allows this protein to function in iron and/or zinc uptake depending on the metal status of the cell. Combinatorial control also allows modulation of activity of the Fet4 in aerobic cells to prevent overaccumulation of toxic metal ions and compensate for lost high affinity transporter activity under these conditions. Combinatorial control of gene expression occurs when a single gene is regulated in response to different signals (1Latchman D.S. Eukaryotic Transcription Factors. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, New York1995Google Scholar). This control is often mediated by the combination of different transcription factor-binding sites in a promoter of the gene and action on those elements by multiple transcriptional activators and/or repressors. Combinatorial control allows expression of a gene to be modulated by multiple signals and this can provide several advantages to a cell or an organism. For example, activity of a particular gene product may be beneficial under a variety of conditions. Alternatively, a gene product may play different roles under different conditions and combinatorial control can allow this to occur as well. Combinatorial control also allows modulation of expression by more than one signal to optimize the expression of a gene to match a particular combination of factors. In this paper, we describe the combinatorial transcriptional regulation of the yeast FET4 gene. FET4 encodes a metal ion transporter and its regulation by multiple signals allows modulation of expression in response to iron, zinc, and oxygen. Metals ions such as iron and zinc are essential nutrients for cells. However, if accumulated to excessive levels, these same elements can be toxic. Therefore, genes encoding the proteins responsible for uptake of metal ions are highly regulated. Metal uptake systems have been well characterized in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2Eide D.J. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2000; 43: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, iron uptake is mediated by several different pathways in this organism. First, yeast can accumulate iron bound to microbial siderophores (3Lesuisse E. Blaiseau P.L. Dancis A. Camadro J.M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although S. cerevisiae does not produce its own siderophores, a number of different transporters can accumulate iron bound by siderophores secreted by other microbes. S. cerevisiae also uses a reductive mechanism for iron uptake. Extracellular Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) by the Fre1 and Fre2 reductases located in the plasma membrane (4Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 5Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The Fe(II) product is then the substrate of a high affinity transport system composed of the Fet3 multicopper oxidase and the Ftr1 permease (6Askwith C. Eide D., Ho, A.V. Bernard P.S., Li, L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 7Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Fet3 uses O2 as a substrate to oxidize Fe(II) back to Fe(III) for subsequent transport by Ftr1 (8DeSilva D.M. Askwith C.C. Eide D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1098-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). High affinity copper uptake is also mediated by a reductive mechanism. Extracellular Cu(II) is reduced to Cu(I) by Fre1 reductase prior to transport across the plasma membrane by the Ctr1 and Ctr3 transporters (9Georgatsou E. Mavrogiannis L.A. Fragiadakis G.S.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1917-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Finally, high affinity zinc transport is mediated by the Zrt1 and Zrt2 proteins (13Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 14Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). These high affinity uptake systems are tightly regulated in response to the cellular status of their respective metal substrates. Iron-limiting growth conditions trigger increased expression of the genes encoding Fre1, Fre2, Fet3, Ftr1, and many other genes involved in iron acquisition (2Eide D.J. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2000; 43: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This induction is mediated by two related transcription factors, Aft1 and Aft2, that share overlapping but nonidentical sets of target genes (15Blaiseau P.L. Lesuisse E. C"

To determine whether the different N-terminal isoforms are functionally distinct with respect to structure, Ca2+ sensitivity, and inhibition of force development, the four known human cardiac troponin T isoforms, TnT1 (all exons present), TnT2 (missing exon 4), TnT3 (missing exon 5), and TnT4 (missing exons 4 and 5), were expressed, purified, and utilized in skinned fiber studies and in reconstituted actomyosin ATPase assays. TnT3, the adult isoform, had a slightly higher α-helical content than the other three isoforms. The variable region in the N terminus of cardiac TnT was found to contribute to the determination of the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development in a charge-dependent manner; the greater the charge the higher the Ca2+ sensitivity, and this was primarily because of exon 5. These studies also demonstrated that removal of either exon 4 or exon 5 from TnT increased the cooperativity of the pCa force relationship. Troponin complexes reconstituted with the four TnT isoforms all yielded the same maximal actin-tropomyosin-activated myosin ATPase activity. However, troponin complexes containing either TnT1 or TnT2 (both containing exon 5) had a reduced ability to inhibit this ATPase activity when compared with wild type troponin (which contains TnT3). Interestingly, fibers containing these isoforms also showed less relaxation suggesting that exon 5 of cardiac TnT affects the ability of Tn to inhibit force development and ATPase activity. These results suggest that the different N-terminal TnT isoforms would produce different functional properties in the heart that would directly affect myocardial contraction.

Four isoforms of cardiac TnT (CTnT) are expressed in human cardiac muscle through combinatorial alternative splicing of two 5′ exons (Fig.1, exons 4 and 5) in a developmentally regulated manner (1Anderson P.A.

First, the skeletal isoforms are shorter by about 30 amino acid residues compared with the cardiac isoforms, and the number of acidic residues (mainly glutamic acid) is much higher in the cardiac isoforms than in the skeletal isoforms. A comparison of CTnTs from different species (human, bovine, rabbit, and chicken, see Fig. 2) shows near identity of the N-terminal 13 amino acid residues (exons 2 and 3), with most of the differences occurring in the next 60 residues (exons 4–8), whereas the next 220 residues (exons 9–18) show high homology. These differences suggest that the N-terminal region of CTnT has possible tissue-specific and developmentally specific role(s).Figure 2Comparison of the N-terminal amino acid sequences of different HCTnT isoforms showing the alternative splicing patterns in the N-terminal hypervariable region.

The HCTnT1 and HCTnT2 isoforms are expressed in the fetal heart, with HCTnT2 being expressed at a very low level. During perinatal heart development, the expression level of HCTnT1 decreases, and the expression of HCTnT3 increases and becomes the only HCTnT isoform in the normal adult heart. HCTnT4 is also expressed in the fetal heart and is re-expressed in the failing adult heart (1Anderson P.A. Malouf N.N. Oakeley A.E. Pagani E.D. Allen P.D. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 1226-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 2Townsend P.J. Barton P.J. Yacoub M.H. Farza H. J. Mol. Cell.

The effects of disease and development on HCTnT isoform expression strongly suggest that these isoforms are important contributors to the vascular function of the heart, helping the heart to adapt to changes in workload. Whether these changes in CTnT isoform expression are an adaptive compensatory response to heart failure is not known. Because TnT is one of the major regulatory proteins in the thin filament (5Zot A.S. Potter J.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 535-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), isoform switching of TnT during heart development may be important in the Ca2+ regulation of myocardial contraction. However, the physiological relevance of HCTnT isoforms in human heart is still poorly understood partially due to the fact that TnT isoform expression is different between vertebrates. Extensive studies with human cardiac tissue have not been possible because of the difficulty of timely processing of the tissue and the limited availability of normal heart tissue. Altered TnT isoform expression has been linked to cardiac hypertrophy, diabetes, and congenital heart disease (6Akella A.B. Ding X.L. Cheng R. Gulati J. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 600-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Gulati J. Akella A.B. Nikolic S.D. Starc V. Siri F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 384-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the changes in TnT isoform expression that occur in heart failure are important in maintaining contractility in the diseased heart. Failed hearts from patients with human idiopathic cardiomyopathy also show HCTnT alterations (1Anderson P.A. Malouf N.N. Oakeley A.E. Pagani E.D. Allen P.D. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 1226-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In guinea pigs subjected to chronic pressure overload with aortic banding to induce ventricular hypertrophy, four distinct TnT isoforms were detected that underwent changes in the relative proportions of the different isoforms during hypertrophy (7Gulati J. Akella A.B. Nikolic S.D. Starc V. Siri F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 384-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Tobacman and Lee (8Tobacman L.S. Lee R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 2668-2672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) investigated the two known bovine CTnT isoforms, BCTnT1 and BCTnT2, that differ from each other by the presence or absence of residues 15–19 (Fig. 2). Differences in the Ca2+ regulation of acto-S1 ATPase were found for these isoforms with BCTnT2 having the highest Ca2+ sensitivity. These results suggest that the N terminus of TnT affects the interaction of Tn with Ca2+. However, some studies (10Wolff M.R. Buck S.H. Stoker S.W. Greaser M.L. Mentzer R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) were unable to find a correlation between the myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity of force in failing hearts and fetal TnT content. The main goal of the present study was to gain insight into the role of the N-terminal hypervariable region in CTnT in cardiac muscle contraction. To address this question, we have characterized four HCTnT isoforms (Fig. 1) using two in vitro functional assays to determine whether any differences exist between the wild type (adult isoform) and other isoforms of TnT. In order to better understand the structure-function relationship of the alternatively spliced N-terminal region of HCTnT, we have also determined the secondary structure of the HCTnT isoforms. This is the first report of purified HCTnT isoforms being used in reconstituted systems and skinned fiber studies. Our results suggest that this alternatively spliced N-terminal region is an important modulator of the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development and also affects the overall secondary structure of the different HCTnT isoforms. Actomyosin ATPase assays also show that the alternatively spliced regions in HCTnT are important for regulating inhibitory ATPase activity. Human CTnT isoforms and mutants were made using a sequential overlapping PCR method (11Ausubel F.M. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995Google Scholar). The adult isoform of HCTnT (HCTnT3), which was already cloned in this laboratory (12Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), was used as a template for PCR with primers designed to introduce or delete the 15- or 30-bp regions which in various combinations results in isoforms 1, 2, and 4. HCTnT1 was created by adding a 30-bp region (exon 5) using the following primers: 3′ CTCCTCCTGCTCGTCTTCGTCCTCTCTCCAGTCCTCCTCTTCTTCAACAGCTGCTTCTTCCTGCTC; 5′ GCAGCTGTTGAAGAAGAGGAGGACTGGAGAGAGGACGAAGACGAGCAGGAGGAGGCAGCGGAAGAG. HCTnT1 was then used to create HCTnT2 by deleting the 15-bp region (exon 4) using the following primers: 3′ GTCCTCCTCTTCTTCCTGCTCCTCCTCCTCGTACTC; 5′ GAGGAGCAGGAAGAAGAGGAGGACTGGAGAGAGGAC. HCTnT3 was used as the template to create HCTNT4 (the 15-bp exon 4 was deleted) using the following oligonucleotides: 3′ CTCCTCCTGCTCTTCCTGCTCCTCCTCCTCGTACTC; 5′ GAGGAGCAGGAAGAGCAGGAGGAGGCAGCGGAAGAG. All subcloned DNA sequences were inserted into the expression plasmid pET3d and sequenced to verify the correct sequences prior to expression and purification. Standard methods previously used in this lab were utilized for expression and purification of the different CTnT mutants (13Potter J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacterially expressed and extracted HCTnTs were purified on a Fast Flow Q-Sepharose column. HCTnT was eluted from this column with a NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m). The semi-purified HCTnT was then further purified on a human troponin C (HCTnC) affinity column. HCTnT was eluted from this column with a double gradient of urea and EDTA (0–6 m and 0–3 mm, respectively). All steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. The purity of the isolated HCTnT was determined by SDS-PAGE. Formation of the human cardiac troponin complexes containing human recombinant HCTnT, HCTnC, and human cardiac troponin I (HCTnI) was carried out as described recently by Szczesna et al. (12Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Proper stoichiometry was verified by SDS-PAGE. Although not done routinely, gel filtration of these formed Tn complexes showed that this reconstitution method resulted in a single species. Porcine cardiac myosin, rabbit skeletal F-actin, porcine cardiac TM, and recombinant human cardiac TnC were prepared as described previously (12Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G.

The ATPase inhibitory assay was performed in a 1-ml reaction mixture of 100 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm ATP, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7. The ATPase activation assay was carried out in the same 1-ml reaction mixture with 1 mm EGTA replaced with 0.5 mm CaCl2. F-actin (3.5 μm), myosin (0.6 μm), and TM (1 μm) were homogenized and added to the reaction tube after the addition of buffer and either wild type (adult) human cardiac Tn (HCTn3), HCTn containing HCTnT1 (HCTn1), HCTn containing HCTnT2 (HCTn2), HCTn containing HCTnT3 (HCTn3), and HCTn containing HCTnT4 (HCTn4) to the assay tube. The ATPase reaction was initiated with the addition of ATP and stopped after 20 min with trichloroacetic acid (4% final concentration). After sedimenting the precipitate, the inorganic phosphate concentration in the supernatant was determined according to the method of Fiske and SubbaRow (14Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The ATPase rates were measured by single time points that were predetermined to be linear with time. All skinned muscle experiments were performed with glycerated porcine papillary muscle preparations. Hearts from newly slaughtered pigs were obtained from a nearby slaughterhouse. Strips of muscle, a few millimeters (mm) in diameter and ∼5 mm in length, were dissected from the papillary muscle of the left ventricle and extracted for 24 h in a 1% Triton X-100 (by volume) containing 49.5% pCa 8.0 relaxing solution and thereafter transferred to a similar replacement solution without Triton X-100. Skinned preparations were treated with low concentrations of HCTnT (isoforms 1–4) resulting in the displacement of the endogenous Tn complex by the added HCTnT (isoforms 1–4). The displaced Tn was then reconstituted by treating the preparation containing the added TnT with a preformed HCTnC·HCTnI complex. To test if the TnT-treated fibers were functional, the Ca2+dependence of force development was measured. As expected, the TnT-treated fibers before reconstitution with HCTnI·HCTnC had unregulated force, and regulation was restored with the addition of a HCTnI·HCTnC complex (12Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The skinned cardiac muscles were mounted using stainless steel clips to a force transducer and immersed in a relaxation solution (pCa 8.0) containing 10−8m[Ca2+], 5 mm [Mg2+], 7 mm EGTA, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 5 mm [Mg2+-ATP], 15 mm creatine phosphate, and 20 units/ml phosphocreatine kinase and between 76 and 92 mm potassium propionate to achieve a constant ionic strength of 150 mm in all solutions (15Guth K. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13627-13635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The contraction solution (pCa 4.0) was the same composition as thepCa 8.0 solution except that the Ca2+concentration was 10−4m and was used to measure the initial force. To determine the dependence of force development, the contraction of skinned cardiac muscle was tested in solutions containing intermediate concentrations of Ca2+. The various pCa solutions were prepared using the room temperature binding constants of Fabiato and Fabiato (16Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1978; 276: 233-255Crossref Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Treatment of the fibers with HCTnT (2 times for 1 h at room temperature with fresh HCTnT solution changed after 1 h of incubation) resulted in a loss of Ca2+ dependence of force, and the fibers became unregulated. The protein concentration of TnT was adjusted to 0.8 mg/ml to obtain maximal displacement of Tn subunits and loss of Ca2+-regulated force. When these fibers were incubated with a preformed HCTnI·HCTnC complex (30 μm), in relaxing solution (pCa 8), the fibers underwent a gradual relaxation as the Tn activity was reconstituted. Once fully relaxed, the force became entirely regulated by Ca2+. Control fibers were treated with the same solutions (minus HCTnT and minus the HCTnI·HCTnC complex) for the same amount of time, in order to estimate the amount of rundown of the fiber during this time. Control experiments carried out on porcine fibers as described above showed that the average rundown for these fibers was ∼12–18%. Taking this average rundown of the fibers into account, the average recovered force for these skinned fiber studies was ∼70% of the original force before treatment with HCTnT and reconstitution with HCTnI·HCTnC. CD spectra of the HCTnT isoforms were recorded on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter using a cell path length of 0.1 cm at ambient temperature (22 °C) in a 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 500 mm KCl solution. In some cases NaF was used instead of KCl to avoid the strong absorption of chloride ions in the far ultraviolet region (17Stafford W.F. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded at 190–250 nm with a bandwidth of 1 nm at a speed of 50 nm/min and a resolution of 0.2 nm. The concentration of the HCTnT isoforms was determined using a Bradford assay with HCTnT3 as the standard. The protein concentration of the HCTnT3 was accurately determined by nitrogen analysis. Analysis and processing of data were carried out using the Jasco system software (Windows Standard Analysis, version 1.20). Ten scans were averaged, base lines subtracted, and no numerical smoothing applied. Mean residue ellipticity ([θ]MRE, in degrees·cm2·dmol−1) for the spectra were calculated (utilizing the Jasco system software) using Equation1, [θ]MRE=[θ]/(10.Cr.l)Equation 1 where [θ] is the measured ellipticity in millidegrees,Cr is the mean residue molar concentration, and lis the path length in cm. The α-helical content for each protein was calculated using the standard Equation 2 for [θ] at 222 nm (18Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 44: 1285-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). [θ]222=−30,300fH−2340Equation 2 f H is the fraction of α-helical content (f H × 100, expressed in %). Spectra are presented as the mean residue ellipticity. The [θ] at 222 nm was the same whether KCl or NaF was used. Values are presented as mean ± S.D. The statistical significance of the differences between the mean values was analyzed by Student's t test. Four isoforms of HCTnT, which are known to be expressed in the human heart, have been generated, purified (Fig.3), and functionally characterized. The regions of TnT involved in critical interactions with TnI and TnC in the Tn complex and with TM in the thin filament have been characterized by various biochemical and biophysical methods and are summarized in Fig. 1. Most of the known binding regions for TM, TnC, and TnI occur in residues 70–278 of HCTnT3. Fig. 3 shows an SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the purified HCTnT isoforms used in these studies. When run on 12% SDS-PAGE, each HCTnT isoform could be separated from the others demonstrating the differences in mobility caused by the deletion of 5, 10, and 15 amino acids in HCTnT2, HCTnT3, and HCTnT4, respectively. The maximum ATPase activity for Tn complexes containing the different HCTnT isoforms in the presence of Ca2+ was similar for all the isoforms (Fig.4). At Tn concentrations greater than 1 μm, the maximum ATPase activity only increased slightly (<10%), and as such the ATPase activity results are presented as a bar chart so that the different HCTnT isoforms could be directly compared. In these experiments the amount of Tn required for maximal ATPase activation was between 1 and 1.5 μm, which is consistent with a ratio of Tn:TM of 1:1. The human cardiac Tn complex containing HCTnT1 (HCTn1) and HCTnT3 (HCTn3) showed slightly lower maximal ATPase activity than the other complexes (Tn complex containing HCTnT2, HCTn2, and Tn complex containing HCTnT4, HCTn4) (Fig. 4). However, this difference in maximal ATPase activity was not found to be significant according to the Student's t test. The ability of HCTnT isoforms to inhibit actin-TM-activated myosin ATPase activity in reconstituted thin filaments was also examined to determine whether the inhibitory activity of the HCTn was affected by the deletions in the N-terminal region of HCTnT. The myosin ATPase activity in the absence of HCTn was considered to be 100% activity (0% inhibition). Whereas HCTn3 was able to inhibit ATPase activity nearly fully in the presence of EGTA (∼82% at 3 μm HCTn3concentration), HCTn1 and HCTn2 were both less effective at inhibiting actomyosin ATPase activity (∼67% at 3 μm HCTn concentration, Fig.5). Under the same conditions used for the HCTn3, HCTn4 inhibited the actin-TM-activated myosin ATPase activity by 84 ± 2%. Although the Tn complexes do not inhibit the myosin ATPase activity fully at physiological concentrations, we are still able to observe a difference between HCTn1 and HCTn3 at physiological Tn concentrations (Fig. 5).Figure 5Effect of the HCTnT isoforms on the inhibition (−Ca2+) of the actin-TM-activated myosin-ATPase activity. The protein concentrations used in this assay are as follows: 3.5 μm actin, 1 μm Tm, 0–3 μm Tn, and 0.6 μm myosin. Each data point represents the average of 4–5 separate experiments each performed in duplicate and is expressed as mean ± S.D. The minimal ATPase activity values for the HCTn1 and HCTn2 are significantly different from the HCTn3 and HCTn4 in the absence of Ca2+ (p< 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When the adult isoform of HCTnT (HCTnT3) was used to displace the native porcine cardiac troponin complex and the skinned fibers then reconstituted with a preformed HCTnI·HCTnC complex, the reconstituted fibers were less sensitive to Ca2+(ΔpCa50 about −0.14) than intact fibers (Fig.6 A). This difference is presumably due to the different Ca2+ response to the endogenous porcine and the human Tn complexes reconstituted into skinned muscle fibers and has been reported previously (19Lang R. Gomes A.V. Zhao J. Housmans P.R. Miller T. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11670-11678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Porcine skinned fiber studies using the TnT displacement of the endogenous Tn complex and HCTnI·HCTnC reconstitution is now a well established method in this laboratory (19Lang R. Gomes A.V. Zhao J. Housmans P.R. Miller T. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11670-11678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because HCTnT3 is the adult isoform, the dependence of all the other isoforms was compared with the Ca2+ dependence of HCTnT3-treated and HCTnI·HCTnC-reconstituted fibers. TableI summarizes thepCa50 values of the force-pCa relationship and the Hill coefficients (n H) for the fibers treated with different HCTnT isoforms.Table IEffect of HCTnT isoforms on the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development (pCa50) and the Hill coefficient (nH) in skinned porcine cardiac muscle fibersHCTnT isoform utilized in the fiberspCa50Hill coefficient, n HNo. experimentsnHCTnT15.66 ± 0.03aIndicates that thepCa50 values for the respective TnT isoforms are significantly different from HCTnT3 and HCTnT4 (p < 0.05).1.76 ± 0.09bIndicates that then H value for HCTnT1 isoform is significantly different from HCTnT4 (p < 0.05).4HCTnT25.63 ± 0.03aIndicates that thepCa50 values for the respective TnT isoforms are significantly different from HCTnT3 and HCTnT4 (p < 0.05).1.92 ± 0.103HCTnT35.53 ± 0.012.01 ± 0.084HCTnT45.48 ± 0.022.13 ± 0.103The pCa50 and n H values are the average of three to four independent fiber experiments, and the errors are the S.D. values.a Indicates that thepCa50 values for the respective TnT isoforms are significantly different from HCTnT3 and HCTnT4 (p < 0.05).b Indicates that then H value for HCTnT1 isoform is significantly different from HCTnT4 (p < 0.05). Open table in a new tab The pCa50 and n H values are the average of three to four independent fiber experiments, and the errors are the S.D. values. In these experiments, after displacing the endogenous porcine Tn complex with the different HCTnT isoforms (0.8 mg/ml), HCTnI·HCTnC was used to reconstitute the HCTnT replaced skinned fibers. The thick and the thin filament proteins exhibit a strict stoichiometry with each other having specific interrelated role(s) in controlling muscle contraction and relaxation. No significant change in any of the other porcine fiber proteins was detected after HCTnT displacement. Both HCTnI and HCTnC levels were restored upon reconstitution as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis (data not shown). After HCTnI·HCTnC was added to the skinned fibers, all the HCTnT isoforms investigated were able to restore the Ca2+ dependence of force development. The Ca2+ dependence of force development was measured before treating each fiber with HCTnT. The level of Ca2+ unregulated force following the HCTnT treatment was equal to ≈60% of the force developed by the untreated skinned fiber preparations. For clarity this level of Ca2+unregulated force was set to 100% to determine the percentage of force activation and inhibition following the HCTnT treatment. In the absence of Ca2+ the level of force remaining after reconstituting the fibers with the HCTnI·HCTnC complex is equivalent to the percentage of Ca2+ unregulated force that was not inhibited by the Tn complex (Fig. 7). The fibers reconstituted with HCTnT1 and HCTnI·HCTnC (HCTn1) had a force of 9.1 ± 4% of unregulated force compared with 3 ± 1% force of fibers reconstituted with HCTnT3 and HCTnI·HCTnC (HCTn3). The level of force after reconstitution of porcine fibers with HCTn3 atpCa 8.0 (3 ± 1%) is consistent with previously published values (11Ausubel F.M. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995Google Scholar). This suggests that Tn containing HCTnT1 is unable to properly inhibit force development at low Ca2+concentrations. The fibers reconstituted with HCTnT2 and HCTnI·HCTnC (HCTn2) had a force of 6.4 ± 2.7% of unregulated force. HCTn4-reconstituted fibers had a slightly lower force that HCTn3-reconstituted fibers at low Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 7). The maximum Ca2+-dependent force recovered is equivalent to the level of force developed in fibers after reconstituting the fibers with the appropriate Tn complex and treating the fiber with pCa 4 solution. The maximal level of force recovered with the different HCTnT isoforms was not significantly different from each other. As seen in Fig. 6, a significant change in the Ca2+ dependence of force was observed between the fibers displaced with the different HCTnT isoforms after reconstitution with HCTnI·HCTnC complex. Fig. 6 B presents the Ca2+ response of force of HCTnT1-treated fibers. HCTnT1-trea"

In primary rat neuronal and HT22 cells, FGF1 promoted a time-dependent inactivation of GSK3β by phosphorylation at serine 9. Blocking FGF1 receptors with heparinase reduced this effect. The effects of FGF1 on GSK3β were dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt) because inhibitors of this pathway or infection with dominant negative Akt adenovirus blocked inactivation. Furthermore, treatment of neuronal cells with FGF1 resulted in ERK-independent Akt phosphorylation and β-catenin translocation into the nucleus. On the other hand, infection with wild-type GSK3β recombinant adenovirus-associated virus increased activity of GSK3β and cell death, both of which were reduced by FGF1 treatment. Moreover, FGF1 protection against glutamate toxicity was dependent on GSK3β inactivation by the PI3K-Akt but was independent of ERK. Taken together these results suggest that neuroprotective effects of FGF1 might involve inactivation of GSK3β by a pathway involving activation of the PI3K-Akt cascades.

While some factors, such as nerve growth factor, support a narrowly defined neuronal population (e.g. cholinergic neurons), other factors such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF)1 support more diverse populations (1Peterson D.A. Lucidi-Phillipi C.A. Murphy D.P. Ray J. Gage F.H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 886-898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the more than 20 members of the FGF family (2Eckstein F.P. J.

Moffett J. Maher P. Tucholski J. Stachowiak E.K. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 15: 257-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Of the four FGF receptors (FGFRs), three are found in the brain: FGFR1 is mainly expressed on neurons, while FGFR2 and FGFR3 are found on glial cells (1Peterson D.A. Lucidi-Phillipi C.A. Murphy D.P. Ray J. Gage F.H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 886-898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Eckstein F.P. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1467-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 6Clarke M.S. Khakee R.

Binding of FGF leads to dimerization of FGFR followed by tyrosine kinase activation (2Eckstein F.P. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1467-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). FGF2 promotes survival of cortical and hippocampal neurons (8Morrison R.S. Sharma A. de Vellis J. Bradshaw R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Similarly, FGF1 protects selective neuronal populations against the neurotoxic effects of molecules involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (10Guo Z. Mattson M. Cereb. Cortex. 2000; 10: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 11Thorns V. Masliah E. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 886-898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is no consensus as to the signal transduction pathways initiated by FGF during neuronal differentiation or during neuroprotection. Some studies suggest that during FGF2-induced neuronal differentiation (i) activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1 and ERK2), is neither necessary nor sufficient, (ii) activation of Src kinases is necessary but not sufficient, and (iii) FGF2 requires at least two signaling pathways activated by Ras and Src (15Klint P. Kanda S. Kloog Y. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3354-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16Kuo W. Chung K. Rosner M. Mol. Cell.

These results indicate that the neuroactive effects of FGF depend on signaling pathways other than ERK. Most studies have focused on the neurotrophic effects of FGF2, while fewer studies have investigated the effects of FGF1. We hypothesize that the neurotrophic effects of FGF1 might involve regulation of other signaling cascades such as the glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) pathway, which is important in determining cell fate (18Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 19Torres M.A. Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Moon R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1427-1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Supporting this possibility, a recent study showed that FGF2-mediated tau hyperphosphorylation was inhibited by lithium, an inhibitor of GSK3β, but not by inhibitors of ERK or the cyclin-dependent kinases (20Tatebayashi Y. Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5245-5254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the present study, we investigated the effects of FGF1 on the GSK3β pathway in rat primary neuronal and HT22 cells. Our results suggest that the neuroprotective properties of FGF1 might involve phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of GSK3β via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway. All experiments were performed with rat primary cortical neurons prepared from embryonic day 17 Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (21Sagara Y. Schubert D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6662-6671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with HT22 cells (22Tan S. Sagara Y. Liu Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), mouse hippocampal cells derived from the HT4 cell line (23Morimoto B.H. Koshland D.E., Jr. Neuron. 1990; 5: 875-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, primary cortical neurons were dissociated from the cortex and maintained in tissue culture dishes coated with 100 μg/ml poly-d-lysine in minimum Eagle’s medium supplemented with 30 mm glucose, 2 mmglutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cultures were used within 1 week after preparation. HT22 cells were maintained at no greater than 70% confluence in 10% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (high glucose, Irvine Scientific, Irvine, CA) with 1 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). To analyze the effects of FGF1 on neurons, cells were placed in N-2-supplemented serum-free medium (Invitrogen) 24 h before treatment. Neurons were then exposed to FGF1 (10 ng/ml, Sigma) for 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min and analyzed by immunoblot for levels of GSK3β, Akt, and ERK1/2. To confirm that FGF1 effects involve signaling through the FGFR pathway, cells were treated with heparinase since FGF signal transduction involves binding both at the high affinity FGF receptor and the low affinity heparin sulfate receptor. Because heparin optimizes the effects of FGF (24Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D165-D177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), additional experiments were performed in which heparin (2.5 units/ml, Sigma) and heparinase (1unit/ml, Sigma) were added 1 h prior to FGF1 treatment (11Thorns V. Masliah E. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To investigate the intracellular signaling pathways involved in mediating FGF1 effects, cells were pretreated for 30 min with (i) ERK inhibitors U0126 and PD98059 (10 μm, Calbiochem) or (ii) PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 μm, Calbiochem). All experiments were performed at least three times. Replication-defective adenovirus vectors expressing mouse Akt protein fused in-frame to the FLAG epitope under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter were constructed as described previously (kind gifts from Dr. Kenneth Walsh, Tufts University, Boston, MA) (26Becker T.C.

For infections, HT22 neuronal cells were plated at ∼50% confluence in serum-free medium and cultured for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Half of the conditioned serum-free medium was removed from each sample, pooled, and stored at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 50 in preconditioned serum-free medium for 4 h. Cells were rinsed three times in warm PBS, and medium was replaced with pooled preconditioned serum-free medium followed by a 48-h incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 48 h, cells were treated with FGF1 (10 ng/ml) for 10 min, harvested in lysis buffer, stored at −20 °C, and later used for the Akt and GSK3β kinase activity assays and Western analyses. For immunocytochemistry, cells were cultured on coverslips and treated as described above, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and blocked overnight at 4 °C in 10% horse serum and 5% bovine serum albumin. Cells on coverslips were then labeled overnight at 4 °C with primary anti-FLAG (1:50) (Sigma) followed by incubation with secondary biotinylated IgG (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) (1:200) for 1 h at room temperature. FLAG proteins were detected with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) and visualized by light microscopy to access FLAG production and transduction efficiency (data not shown). This assay confirmed that transfection efficiency was up to 90%. Experiments were conducted at least three times to ensure reproducibility. Expression of exogenous GSK3β was performed using the recombinant adenovirus-associated virus (rAAV) Helper-Free System (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with minor modifications. Briefly, pXT7 plasmids bearing wild-type GSK3β cDNA (kind gifts from Dr. Zhengui Xia, University of Washington, Seattle, WA and Dr. Isabel Dominguez, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA) were digested with XbaI followed by ligation of the fragments into the XbaI site of the pCMV-MCS expression vector (Stratagene). The resulting pCMV-MCS-GSK3β plasmids were then cut with NotI followed by ligation of GSK3β-containing fragments to the NotI fragments of pAAV-LacZ (Stratagene) to yield the pAAV-GSK3β. For generation of the rAAV, subconfluent 293T cells were transfected without or with the pAAV-GSK3β together with pAAV-RC and pHelper plasmid (Stratagene) using Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After incubation for 72 h, cells were harvested and lysed by four freeze-thaw cycles. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min to remove cell debris and frozen at −80 °C until use. As a positive control, pAAV-GFP (Stratagene) was used to confirm the transfection efficiency. Subconfluent neuronal cells were preincubated with hydroxyurea (40 mm) and sodium butylate (1 mm) for 6 h. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with the transfected 293T cell lysates (1/10 dilution) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 2% fetal calf serum for 24 h. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 2% fetal calf serum for an additional 36 h. Finally, cells treated with or without FGF1 were harvested and further analyzed as described above. As a positive control, HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells were used to confirm the transfection efficiency. Experiments were conducted at least three times to ensure reproducibility. Briefly, as previously described (11Thorns V. Masliah E. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar,31Sanders V. Everall I.P. Johnson R.W. Masliah E. Group T.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 671-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), pellets of whole neuronal cell homogenates treated as previously described were sonicated for 30 s in HEPES homogenization buffer (1 mm HEPES, 5 mm benzamidine, 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 3 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm magnesium sulfate, 0.05% sodium azide, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry (58Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 10–15 μg of protein/well were loaded onto 10% Tris-glycine ready gels (Bio-Rad). Samples were electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and immunolabeled with primary antibodies against total GSK3β (mouse monoclonal, 1:2500, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), phospho-GSK3β (Ser-9, rabbit polyclonal, 1:2500, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), total ERK1/2 (mouse monoclonal, 1:2500, New England Biolabs), phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204, mouse monoclonal, 1:2500, New England Biolabs), total Akt (rabbit polyclonal, 1:2500, New England Biolabs), and phospho-Akt (Thr-308, rabbit polyclonal, 1:2500, New England Biolabs). Membranes were incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-tagged secondary antibody (1:5000) and exposed to the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) followed by autoradiography. Western blots were performed at least three times to ensure reproducibility. Assays were performed essentially as described previously with some modifications (18Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Briefly, for the GSK3β assay, cells were rinsed twice with cold PBS and incubated for 20 min on ice in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). The cell lysates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm, and protein concentration was determined using the BCA reagent (Pierce). Two hundred micrograms of the supernatant were preabsorbed with a protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, and the precleared lysates were incubated with anti-GSK3β monoclonal antibody (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were then washed twice with the lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA). Finally, the immune complexes were incubated in 30 μl of the kinase buffer containing either 2.5 μg of phosphoglycogen synthase-2 peptides or the Ala-21 mutant peptides (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid NY) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 500 mm EDTA and 5 mm ATP. Samples were then spotted onto Whatman P81 phosphocellulose filter paper. The filters were washed with 180 mm phosphoric acid, dried with acetone, and analyzed by scintillation counting. Immune complex kinase assays for Akt were performed as described for the GSK3β assay with minor modifications. Briefly, the precleared lysates were incubated with polyclonal anti-human Akt antibody (anti-protein kinase B-(88–100)) (1 μg/sample) (Calbiochem) followed by incubation in protein G-Sepharose. After washing, immune complex assays were performed in the presence of 1.0 μg of GSK3β fusion protein (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) as substrate. Reactions were terminated by an addition of the SDS sample buffer. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (15%) analysis followed by autoradiography. Quantification was performed with the PhosphorImager using the Image Quant software (Amersham Biosciences). Further analysis of catalytically active GSK3β was carried out in neuronal cultures by immunocytochemical visualization of the cellular localization of β-catenin. Using this method, inactivation of GSK3β is associated with nuclear translocation of β-catenin (32Dierick H. Bejsovec A. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 153-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 33Hart M. de los Santos R. Albert I. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, exposed to FGF1 in the presence or absence of inhibitors as described above, and fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were then immunolabeled with the mouse monoclonal antibody against β-catenin (1:1000, Transduction Laboratories) followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG (1:75) (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Cells on coverslips were analyzed with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad MRC 1024). For each experimental condition, a total of 20 cells were analyzed in duplicate. For each condition, cellular distribution of β-catenin was recorded, and computer-assisted image analysis was performed to estimate the percentage of cells displaying predominantly nuclear versuscytoplasmic distribution of β-catenin. To determine whether the effects of FGF1 on the PI3K-Akt, GSK3β, and ERK pathways influenced cell viability, neuronal cells treated with glutamate (5 mm, Sigma) were analyzed for DNA fragmentation and by the MTT assay and trypan blue exclusion. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis for the DNA fragmentation was conducted using the flow cytometric method of Nicoletti et al. (34Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4414) Google Scholar) as previously described. This assay is highly correlated (R2 = 0.82) with the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis as determined by annexin-V staining. Briefly, cell nuclei were stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide in a hypotonic lysis buffer at 4 °C for 2 h. Samples were then run on a FACScan (BD PharMingen) to quantify DNA fragmentation on the FL3 channel (propidium iodide). Cell debris were excluded from nuclei by an empirical setting of forward scatter and side scatter threshold levels. Apoptotic nuclear bodies appeared as a broad hypodiploid peak easily discernable from the narrow peak of cells with normal diploid DNA content. For the MTT assay, 2.5 × 103 cells/well were plated in 100 μl of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in 96-well microtiter plates. On the following day, after replacing the growth medium with the N-2-supplemented serum-free medium, cells were treated with inhibitors or activators (pharmacological, adenoviral or adenovirus-associated constructs) of the PI3K-Akt or GSK3β pathways followed by a 24-h treatment with FGF1 (10 ng/ml). The next day, cells were treated with 5 mm glutamate for an additional 24 h followed by cell survival assays. For the MTT assay (35Hsu L.J. Sagara Y. Arroyo A. Rockenstein E. Sisk A. Mallory M. Wong J. Takenouchi T. Hashimoto M. Masliah E. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), 10 μl of MTT solution (2.5 mg/ml) was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 4–8 h followed by the addition of 100 μl of solubilization solution (50% dimethylformamide and 20% SDS, pH 4.8). The next day absorption values were read at 570 nm. Experiments were done in triplicate, and results were averaged. For trypan blue exclusion, after treating as described, cells were stained with trypan blue (Sigma), and 100 cells/sample were visualized and counted as either dead or alive with an Axiovert inverted microscope. Cells staining blue, indicating cell membrane compromise, were counted as dead. To investigate the effects of FGF1 on Akt, GSK3β, and ERK, we first determined the time course for phosphorylation of these protein kinases in rat cortical neurons and HT22 cells. Western blot analysis showed that stimulation with FGF1 resulted in maximum Akt, GSK3β, and ERK phosphorylation at 10–15 min followed by a progressive decrease reaching non-detectable levels at 60 min (Fig.1). Since FGF1 signal transduction involves binding both at the high affinity FGF receptor and the low affinity heparin sulfate receptor, optimizing the effects of FGF (24Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), experiments were performed with heparin and heparinase. While pretreatment with heparinase blocked primarily Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation and to a lesser extent reduced ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2), heparin enhanced FGF1-mediated phosphorylation of all three kinases (not shown).Figure 2Effects of heparinase on FGF1-mediated Akt , GSK3β, and ERK phosphorylation in primary cortical neurons. Western blot analysis showed that pretreatment of neuronal cells with heparinase (1 unit/ml, 1 h) reduced the effects of FGF1 in promoting phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β but had no effect on ERK phosphorylation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since time course experiments (Fig. 1) suggested that the effects of FGF1 on GSK3β might be mediated via either the PI3K-Akt or the ERK signaling pathways, further analysis of the molecular events was conducted by treating cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or the ERK inhibitors U0126 and PD98059 prior to FGF1 stimulation. Inhibition of PI3K, which is upstream of Akt (18Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar), resulted in decreased phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β but had no effect on ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3). In contrast, inhibitors of the ERK pathway completely blocked FGF1-mediated ERK phosphorylation with only slight effects on Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Taken together these results indicate that phosphorylation of GSK3β by FGF1 stimulation is mediated via the PI3K-Akt pathway but is independent of ERK. To further confirm that FGF1-mediated phosphorylation of GSK3β via PI3K-Akt resulted in inactivation of GSK3β, immunocomplex kinase assays were performed. FGF1 treatment decreased GSK3β activity by 40%, while inhibition of the PI3K-Akt pathway with LY294002 re-established GSK3β activity even in the presence of FGF1 (Fig.4A). Inhibition of the ERK pathway with U0126 did not interfere with the FGF1-mediated effect on GSK3β activity (Fig. 4A). Moreover, while transfection of neuronal cells with dominant negative Akt re-established GSK3β activity and blocked FGF1 effects on GSK3β (Fig. 4B), constitutively active Akt reduced GSK3β activity in a similar fashion to FGF1 (Fig. 4B). Immunocomplex activity assays for Akt confirmed that dominant negative Akt blocked FGF1 effects on Akt (Fig.4C), and constitutively active Akt increased basal Akt activity levels (Fig. 4C). Consistent with these results, Western blot analysis showed that dominant negative Akt resulted in reduced Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation, while constitutively active Akt increased Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, these effects were enhanced by FGF1 (Fig.4D). Neuronal cells were also infected with a rAAV-expressing wild-type GSK3β or with a control vector (AdV-GFP). In cells transfected with rAAV wild-type GSK3β, the activity of this enzyme (Fig.5A) as well as cell death (not shown) increased over basal levels compared with vector control. In contrast, pretreatment with FGF1 decreased GSK3β activity in neuronal cells infected with rAAV wild-type GSK3β (Fig. 5A). Western blot analysis using antibodies against phosphorylated and total GSK3β (Fig. 5B) confirmed these findings. Taken together these results support the notion that FGF1 might regulate GSK3β activity via PI3K-Akt activation. Since previous studies show that inactivation of GSK3β by phosphorylation at serine 9 results in translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus (33Hart M. de los Santos R. Albert I. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), immunocytochemical analyses with β-catenin antibodies were performed in neurons treated with FGF1 with or without pharmacological inhibitors. Laser scanning confocal microscopy showed that under basal conditions β-catenin immunoreactivity was primarily in the cytoplasm and, to a lesser extent, in the nucleus (Fig.6, A and B). After stimulation with FGF1, β-catenin labeling in the nucleus was significantly increased (Fig. 6, C and D). Consistent with Western blot studies (Fig. 3) and kinase assays (Fig.4), the effects of FGF1 on β-catenin nuclear localization were blocked by LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) (Fig. 6E) but not by the ERK inhibitors PD98059 (Fig. 6F) and U0126 (Fig.6G), supporting the idea that FGF1 blocks GSK3β activation leading to β-catenin degradation. To investigate the physiological relevance of FGF1 on the PI3K-Akt, GSK3β, and ERK pathways, cell viability was measured by DNA fragmentation, the MTT assay, and trypan blue exclusion in cells pretreated with FGF1 (10 ng/ml, 24 h) and challenged with glutamate (5 mm, 24 h) in the presence or absence of specific inhibitors. Consistent with results from the MTT assay and trypan blue exclusion (not shown), DNA fragmentation studies showed that FGF1 protected neurons against neurotoxic effects of glutamate and that these ef"

Submicromolar phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), which stimulates PKC, acutely activated Ca2+ uptake in VR1-expressing cells at pH 5.5, but not at mildly acidic or neutral pH. PDBu was antagonized by bisindolylmaleimide, a PKC inhibitor, and ruthenium red, a VR1 ionophore blocker, but not capsazepine, a vanilloid antagonist indicating that catalytic activity of PKC is required for PDBu activation of VR1 ion conductance, and is independent of the vanilloid site. Chronic PDBu dramatically down-regulated PKCα in dorsal root ganglion neurons or the VR1 cell lines, whereas only partially influencing PKCβ, -δ, -ε, and −ζ. Loss of PKCα correlated with loss of response to acute re-challenge with PDBu. Anandamide, a VR1 agonist in acidic conditions, acts additively with PDBu and remains effective after chronic PKC down-regulation. Thus, two independent VR1 activation pathways can be discriminated: (i) direct ligand binding (anandamide, vanilloids) or (ii) extracellular ligands coupled to PKC by intracellular signaling. Experiments in cell lines co-expressing VR1 with different sets of PKC isozymes showed that acute PDBu-induced activation requires PKCα, but not PKCε. These studies suggest that PKCα in sensory neurons may elicit or enhance pain during inflammation or ischemia.

In addition, evidence is accumulating that protein kinases, including PKA and PKC, may directly induce or potentiate VR1 activity (7De Petrocellis L. Harrison S. Bisogno T. Tognetto M. Brandi I.

Physiol. 2001; 534: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). However, the specific PKC isozyme(s) and exact mechanism(s) leading to channel opening are under active investigation. Acute application of phorbol esters sensitizes knee joint sensory nerves (10Schepelmann K. Messlinger K. Schmidt R.F. Exp. Brain Res. 1993; 92: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and enhances neuronal ionic currents activated by a noxious thermal stimulus (11Cesare P. McNaughton P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15435-15439Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 12Cesare P. Dekker L.V. Sardini A. Parker P.J. McNaughton P.A. Neuron. 1999; 23: 617-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), but these studies did not connect PKC activation to VR1 activation. PKC also seems to be an important mediator of bradykinin- and epinephrine-induced nociceptor sensitization and hyperalgesia (13McGuirk S.M. Dolphin A.C. Neuroscience. 1992; 49: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Khasar S.G. McCarter G. Levine J.D. J.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4680-4685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, PKC appears to be an effector in multiple signal transduction cascades in primary afferent neurons. However, PKC is not a “single entity,” but a family of at least 11 serine-threonine kinases with different protein substrate specificities (17Tanaka C. Nishizuka Y. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 551-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 18Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem.

Whereas there are functional differences between PKC isozymes, it is not exactly known which isozymes contribute to nociceptive processing. One approach to demonstrate specific involvement of a particular PKC isozyme is targeted gene deletion. Knockout of the PKCγ isozyme in mice suggested that this enzyme, which is normally highly expressed in specific second order neurons in spinal inner lamina II, was involved in the proper processing of incoming afferent nociceptive signals (20Iadarola J.M. Caudle R.M. Science. 1997; 278: 239-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Malmberg A.B. Chen C. Tonegawa S. Basbaum A.I.

Fowler J.H. McGill M.M. Todd A.J. Brain Res. 1999; 833: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Another approach to identify specific isozyme participation is selective down-regulation of PKC isotypes by exposure to active phorbol esters. Acute treatment (i.e. 1 μm PDBu for 10 min) not only activates classical and novel PKC isozymes but also induces enzyme translocation to the plasma membrane. Upon chronic exposure (∼24 h) this leads to isozyme-selective proteolysis and differential down-regulation. Either classical PKC isotypes, activated by diacylglycerol and Ca2+, or novel PKC isotypes, activated by diacylglycerol only, can be specifically down-regulated by micromolar doses of PDBu, but to different degrees (24Spiegel S. Olah Z. Cuvillier O. Edsall L.C. Janoff A.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In primary sensory neurons prepared from 2-day-old rats, Cesare et al.(12Cesare P. Dekker L.V. Sardini A. Parker P.J. McNaughton P.A. Neuron. 1999; 23: 617-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) reported expression of only 5 isoforms, PKCβI, -βII, -δ, -ε, and -ζ. Upon treatment with bradykinin, an endogenous algesic peptide, only PKCε was determined to translocate to the plasma membrane in the DRG cultures (12Cesare P. Dekker L.V. Sardini A. Parker P.J. McNaughton P.A. Neuron. 1999; 23: 617-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In contrast to the isozyme pattern detected in sensory neurons from newborns, PKCα, an additional isozyme was positively identified in DRG cultures prepared from 3-month-old rats, which may regulate VR1 in adults (25Ma W. Zheng W.H. Belanger S. Kar S. Quirion R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 1125-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Bradykinin was also found to release VR1 from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-mediated inhibition, a mechanism proposed for pain-specific channel opening (26Chuang H.H. Prescott E.D. Kong H. Shields S. Jordt S.E. Basbaum A.I. Chao M.V. Julius D. Nature. 2001; 411: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). The intracellular signaling pathways upstream of PKC isozymes in nociceptive afferents still represent open questions. Receptors for histamine, peptides, different allergens, and neuronal growth and survival factors and eicosanoids, which are connected via phospholipases (i.e. phospholipases C and D) to PKC signaling, are all good candidates to modulate VR1 activity of sensory neurons. Nerve growth factor (NGF), abundantly synthesized de novo after spinal cord injury and inflammation, was noted to couple to PKC. Administration of NGF to neonatal and adult ratsin vivo was reported to produce hyperalgesia through activation of PKC (27Lewin G.R. Ritter A.M. Mendell L.M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2136-2148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Axonal growth and differentiation experiments in cultured PC-12 rat pheochromocytoma cells pointed toward the novel PKCε, a Ca2+-insensitive isotype, as an effector enzyme for NGF-mediated intracellular signaling (28Safieh-Garabedian B. Poole S. Allchorne A. Winter J. Woolf C.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 115: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 29Ohmichi M. Zhu G. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). NGF pretreatment also was noted to potentiate CAP-induced inward currents in voltage-clamped DRG neurons, suggesting either synergy or additively (30Shu X. Mendell L.M. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 274: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Moreover, other neurotrophins, such as neurotrophins-3 can influence the central terminals of their respective afferent neurons after injury (31Mendell L.M. Pain. 1999; 6 (suppl.): S127-S132Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Among several mRNAs, NGF can induce transcription of VR1 in dissociated cultures of adult DRG, as well as VR1 protein levels in undamaged DRG neurons after partial nerve injury (32Winston J. Toma H. Shenoy M. Pasricha P.J. Pain. 2001; 89: 181-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 33Hudson L.J. Bevan S. Wotherspoon G. Gentry C. Fox A. Winter J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 2105-2114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together these observations suggest that NGF may engender hyperalgesia either by de novo transcription and translation or by direct, PKC-mediated activation of VR1. The regulation of VR1 by PKC is also supported by the PKCε−mediated increase in VR1 ion currents in DRG neurons and in cells ectopically expressing recombinant vanilloid receptor (8Premkumar L.S. Ahern G.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). In addition, or as an alternative to direct signaling via PKC, NGF was observed to act as a liberator of VR1 from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-mediated blockade (26Chuang H.H. Prescott E.D. Kong H. Shields S. Jordt S.E. Basbaum A.I. Chao M.V. Julius D. Nature. 2001; 411: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). In the current study, we present evidence suggesting a direct role of PKC in VR1 activation. In particular, full expression of PKCα was found to be essential for acute activation of VR1 with PDBu, a synthetic, stable agonist of classic and novel PKCs. This action was examined in primary DRG cultures as well as NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells stably transfected to express VR1ε, a C-terminal ε-epitope-tagged VR1 recombinant (4Olah Z. Szabo T. Karai L.

Each system has a different, complementary composition of PKC isozymes, which permitted discrimination of the isoforms that affected VR1 function. NIH 3T3 cells were determined to express classical PKCα, novel PKCδ and -ε, and atypical PKCζ isoforms, respectively (34Lehel C. Olah Z. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Anderson W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4761-4766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, PKCε, a previously proposed upstream regulator of VR1 was not expressed in HeLa and was not required for activation of ectopically expressed VR1. Our findings in DRG cultures, VR1ε-NIH 3T3 and VR1ε-HeLa cell lines, strongly suggest that PKCα can sensitize and/or activate VR1 in the absence of endogenous ligands, including anandamide (ANA), an endovanilloid/eicosanoid agonist of VR1 in acidosis (5Olah Z. Karai L. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31163-31170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In VR1ε-HeLa cells, another permanent line we established, acute PDBu induced ionophore activity of VR1 even in the absence of PKCε. ANA activates VR1 in an additive fashion with PKC, yet is independent of PKC, because ANA activation is retained after chronic PDBu-mediated down-regulation of PKCα. Similar to ANA (5Olah Z. Karai L. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31163-31170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the PKC activation of VR1 requires a drop of extracellular pH < 6.5, indicating that the protonated VR1 conformer serves as a better substrate of PKC. Our observations emphasize the conditional requirements for the actions of endovanilloids and PKC and their capacity to work in a concerted, additive fashion on the nociceptive nerve terminal. C-terminal-tagged chimeric rat VR1ε was prepared in the pεMTH vector plasmid vector (35Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), as described previously (4Olah Z. Szabo T. Karai L. Hough C. Fields R.D. Caudle R.M. Blumberg P.M. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11021-11030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To develop cell lines permanently expressing VR1ε, we used mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and human HeLa adenocarcinoma-derived cells. The parental lines were determined to have low levels of Ca2+ transport that were not altered by treatment with vanilloids, ANA, or PDBu. To avoid toxicity that occurs with VR1 overexpression, VR1ε was expressed in the cell lines using only the basal activity of the metallothionein promoter, as described earlier (5Olah Z. Karai L. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31163-31170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For the purpose of clarity, in sentences where PKCε is discussed in conjunction with VR1ε (e.g. VR1ε-HeLa) we refer to it as VR1 (e.g. VR1-HeLa). DRG neuron-enriched cultures were prepared from embryonic rats (E16) (4Olah Z. Szabo T. Karai L. Hough C. Fields R.D. Caudle R.M. Blumberg P.M. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11021-11030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, DRGs were dissected and then processed in fresh dissection medium (Lebowitz medium, Invitrogen) until plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium contained 20 mm HEPES (to prevent acidification and stabilize pH at 7.4), 7.5% fetal bovine serum, 7.5% horse serum, 5 mg/ml uridine supplemented with 2 mg/ml 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine, and 40 ng/ml NGF to inhibit cell division and promote neuronal survival and differentiation, respectively. Surfaces for cell culture were coated with poly-d-lysine and laminin. Cells were seeded on 25-mm glass coverslips or on multiwell microtiter plates. Cultures were selected in this medium for 1 week, at which point well differentiated neurons dominated the population. Primary DRG cultures in this stage were used in radioactive and fluorescent video microscopy Ca2+ uptake assays. To down-regulate PKC isozymes, DRG neurons and VR1 expressing NIH 3T3 and HeLa cell lines were chronically treated with 2 μm PDBu in complete medium for 24 h. To determine the effect of chronic PDBu on PKC protein levels, individual PKCs were analyzed with isozyme-specific antibodies. The influence of PKC down-regulation on acute ANA and PDBu-induced Ca2+ uptake was studied in short-term (10 min) experiments, as described above. Recovery of PKCα from the down-regulated state (2 μm PDBu, 24 h) was monitored in confluent cultures of VR1ε-NIH3T3 cells. Cells were chronically treated in 96-well plates with PDBu (2 μm, 24 h), one set of 12 wells at a time, then changed back into complete growth medium without PDBu and cultured over the 15-day period of the recovery experiment, changing the growth medium every 3rd day. Western blotting experiments were carried out on nontreated cells and cells chronically treated on the 6th, 7th, 13th, and 15th day before cell harvest. In a parallel set of cultures, the effect of recovery of PKCα was studied using acute PDBu-induced Ca2+ uptake as the VR1-dependent end point. 45Ca2+uptake experiments were carried out on 1-week-old primary DRG cultures (3 × 104 cells/well) and on established VR1ε-NIH 3T3 and HeLa cell lines (3 × 104 cells/well), which were seeded 1 day before use. Immediately before the assay, cells were adapted to room temperature (24 °C) for 5 min in Hanks' balanced salt solution (pH 6.0), supplemented with 10 μmCa2+ and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (HCB).45Ca2+ uptake was performed for 10 min at 24 °C in HCB using 0.2 μCi of 45Ca2+ as radioactive tracer in a 200-μl final volume. To determine the pH dependence of the 45Ca2+ uptake, HCB was buffered with 20 mm Tris-HCl, adjusted to the indicated pH with 1 m MES (HCBTM). To stop45Ca2+ uptake, cells were rapidly changed back into 1 ml of HCB, washed two additional times with 1 ml of HCB, and then lysed in 200 μl/well of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA) for 30 min. Aliquots of the solubilized cell extracts were counted in a liquid scintillation counter. For determination of [Ca2+]i an Olympus BX 60 microscope equipped with a low-light fluorescence intensifier system was used, as described earlier (36Simpson P.B. Mehotra S. Lange G.D. Russell J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22654-22661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). DRG cultures were preloaded with 5 μm fluo-4 AM dye for 30 min at 34 °C, and then washed three times in HCB to remove excess dye and kept in the dark for at least 15 min before starting the experiments. Recordings were carried out in a closed imaging chamber (PH-2, Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden CT), which was perfused with a pump (Miniplus 3, Gilson, France). The emitted fluorescence intensity was calculated from images taken at 10-s intervals by the synapse 3.6e software, an image acquisition and analysis program, as recommended by the manufacturer (Synergy Research, Silver Spring, MD). To monitor vanilloid-induced changes in [Ca2+]i, after 1 min of baseline recording, DRG neuron cultures were perfused with 1 μm CAP in HCBTM for 30 s, then the medium was changed back to drug-free HCBTM. The hydrophilic C-terminal fragment of rat VR1 (Met682-Lys838), extended with a C-terminal (His)6 tag was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction employing GGAAGGATTTCAGAATTCATGGGTGAGACCGTCAACAAGATT as forward primer and TGTCGACCTCGACTCAATGATGATGATGATGATGTTTCTCCCCTGGGACCATGGAATC as reverse primer. The PCR-amplified cDNA fragment incorporated theEcoRI and SalI restriction sites from the forward and reverse primers, respectively, and these sites were used to insert the fragment into the pMALc2x (New England BioLabs) prokaryotic expression vector. The peptide fragment was cloned in-frame and downstream of the coding region for maltose-binding protein (MBP).Escherichia coli cells were transformed with the MBP-VR1C(His)6 construct and production of the fusion protein was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The MBP-VR1C(His)6 chimeric protein was double affinity purified using the MBP and His tags, consecutively, as recommended by the manufacturers (New England BioLabs and Novagen). The affinity purified MBP-VR1C(His)6 protein was used to immunize two rabbits. After 8 weeks of immunizations at biweekly intervals, sera were tested at 1:500 dilutions in Western blotting experiments using SDS extracts prepared from neuron-enriched DRG cultures of E16 embryonic rats. ANA (1:4 in a soybean oil:water emulsion), was purchased from Tocris and PDBu from Calbiochem. 45Ca was purchased from ICN. PKC isozyme-specific antibodies were obtained as follows: PKCα, clone M6 mouse monoclonal from Upstate Biotechnology; PKCδ and -ε affinity purified polyclonals from Invitrogen; and PKCζ from Calbiochem. Affinity purified anti-RAKIGQGTKAPEEKTANTISK, a specific PKCβ peptide antibody was prepared in rabbits and characterized as described earlier (37Roth B.L. Mehegan J.P. Jacobowitz D.M. Robey F. Iadarola M.J. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To study PKC-dependent up-regulation of VR1, permanent cell lines ectopically expressing an ε-epitope-tagged recombinant of VR1 were established in both NIH 3T3 (4Olah Z. Szabo T. Karai L. Hough C. Fields R.D. Caudle R.M. Blumberg P.M. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11021-11030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and HeLa cells. VR1 specificity and pH dependence of acute (10 min) PDBu-induced45Ca2+ transport were studied in the parental, immortalized NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast and VR1ε-NIH 3T3 cell lines at pH 5.5 and 7.5, as indicated (Fig. 1). In the parental line, the basal Ca2+ uptake at pH 7.5 was about 4 times higher than at 5.5, and addition of PDBu to the assay medium had little or no effect on the basal uptake at either pH. Expression of recombinant VR1 elevated the baseline compared with parental NIH 3T3 cells at either pH 5.5 or 7.5. At pH 6.5, 7.0, and 7.5 only minor increases in calcium uptake occurred with ascending PDBu concentrations. However, the net change for VR1ε-NIH 3T3 cells was not different from the parental cell line at pH 7.5 (open triangles), indicating that these elevations are not dependent on the expression of VR1. The marked transition in ionophore activity occurs with PDBu treatment when the VR1ε-NIH 3T3 cells are at pH 5.5. Addition of PDBu at submicromolar concentrations increased Ca2+ transport in a concentration-dependent manner between 3- and 4-fold over baseline as determined in repeated experiments (Figs. 1 and 2). An increase in Ca2+ uptake could be detected at around 20 nm and the EC50 of PDBu-induced45Ca2+ uptake at pH 5.5 was ∼100 nm, and reached a plateau at concentrations above 1 μm (Figs. 1 and 2 a).Figure 2PDBu and PKC catalytic activity and ion conductance of VR1. a, inhibition of PDBu-induced Ca2+ uptake was analyzed at pH 5.5 with BIS, an ATP-binding site-directed inhibitor of PKC. BIS (25 μm) added together with increasing concentrations of PDBu completely inhibited the PDBu-inducible portion of 45Ca2+ uptake in VR1ε-NIH 3T3 cells, indicating that the catalytic activity of PKC is required for up-regulation of the VR1 channel. Each pointrepresents the mean ± S.E. of triplicate determinations. Similar results were obtained in two independent experiments also performed in triplicate. b, PDBu-activated calcium uptake was inhibited by ruthenium red (RR), a VR1 channel blocker, but not by CPZ, an antagonist at the vanilloid-binding site. Similar results were obtained in two additional experiments carried out in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further study the PKC specificity of PDBu-induced, VR1-mediated45Ca2+ uptake at pH 5.5, bisindolylmaleimide (BIS), an inhibitor directed to the catalytic ATP-binding site of PKC, was co-incubated with increasing concentrations of PDBu (Fig.2 a). BIS (25 μm) added together with progressively increasing concentrations of PDBu completely inhibited the inducible portion of the 45Ca2+ uptake, but had only slight or no effect on baseline uptake in VR1ε-NIH 3T3 cells. Studies with VR1 selective inhibitors showed that acute PDBu-induced 45Ca2+ transport was nearly completely inhibited by 10 μm ruthenium red (a blocker of the VR1 ionophore), but not with a high concentration (25 μm) of capsazepine (CPZ, a competitive antagonist at the vanilloid ligand-binding site) (Fig. 2 b). Western blotting with specific antibodies was employed to analyze expression of VR1 and different PKC isozymes in DRG cultures and VR1ε-NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 3). The DRG cultures from E16 embryonic rats were enriched for neurons by a 1-week treatment with 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine to eliminate dividing cells. Cultures were also treated with NGF to promote neuronal differentiation. Before Western blotting, the DRG cultures were morphologically and functionally characterized with phase-contrast and fluorescence video microscopy. After 1 week, the DRG cultures typically contained large (25–30 μm in diameter), medium (∼15–25 μm), and small size (7–10 μm) neurons in close to equal ratio. The CAP-induced increase of intracellular [Ca2+]i in the DRG cultures is one of the markers we used to identify of VR1-expressing nociceptors. After loading cultures with fluo-4, a Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye, cells within the latter two populations (∼30% of the total) responded to 1 μm CAP with elevated green fluorescence (Fig. 3,a versus b). VR1 expression was determined immunochemically by a rabbit antibody, raised against MBP-VR1C(His)6, a soluble C-terminal fragment of rat VR1. The immune sera recognized a prominent band at 92 ± 4 kDa in DRG extracts (Fig. 3 c), which corresponds well with the theoretical molecular mass of rat holo-VR1 (94.9 kDa). In addition to the 94.9-kDa protein, our antibody detected a 114-kDa glycosylated form of VR1 (38Kedei N. Szabo T. Lile J.D. Treanor J.J. Olah Z. Iadarola M.J. Bumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28613-28619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), in extracts from VR1ε-NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 3 d). The expression of different isoforms of PKC in extracts prepared from either control or chronic PDBu-treated DRG cultures or VR1ε-NIH 3T3 cells was determined by Western blotting employing isotype-specific antibodies. The DRG cultures expressed PKCα, in addition to PKCβ, -δ, -ε, and -ζ isozymes; the latter have been reported previously in cultures from neonatal animals (12Cesare P. Dekker L.V. Sardini A. Parker P.J. McNaughton P.A. Neuron. 1999; 23: 617-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Chronic PDBu treatment had the most dramatic effect on the PKCα isozyme, which was almost completely down-regulated in both DRG neurons and VR1ε-NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 3,c and d). However, chronic PDBu produced only a partial down-regulation of the PKCβ, -δ, and -ε isoforms in DRG neurons. Similar effects were seen in the VR1ε-NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 3,c and d) except that no PKCβ was measured, which is in accordance with previous observations in the parental NIH 3T3 cell line (34Lehel C. Olah Z. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Anderson W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4761-4766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 d). As expected from a nonphorbol-binding isotype, little or no change was noted in the levels of PKCζ in either cell system. The effects of chronic PDBu-induced down-regulation on45Ca2+ uptake were studied in a parallel set of DRG cultures as those analyzed above for VR1 and PKC isozyme expression. Chronic PDBu almost completely eliminated the"

Using consensus sequences derived from conserved regions of the bacterial IF3, several partially sequenced cDNA clones were identified, and the complete sequence was assembled in silico from overlapping clones. IF3mt is 278 amino acid residues in length. MitoProt II predicts a 97% probability that this protein will be localized in mitochondria and further predicts that the mature protein will be 247 residues in length. The cDNA for the predicted mature form of IF3mt was cloned, and the protein was expressed inEscherichia coli in a His-tagged form. The mature form of IF3mt has short extensions on the N and C termini surrounding a region homologous to bacterial IF3. The region of IF3mt homologous to prokaryotic factors ranges between 21–26% identical to the bacterial proteins. Purified IF3mt promotes initiation complex formation on mitochondrial 55 S ribosomes in the presence of mitochondrial initiation factor 2 (IF2mt), [35S]fMet-tRNA, and either poly(A,U,G) or an in vitro transcript of the cytochrome oxidase subunit II gene as mRNA.

Mammalian mitochondria synthesize 13 polypeptides that are essential for oxidative phosphorylation. These 13 proteins are translated from nine monocistronic and two dicistronic mRNAs with overlapping reading frames (1Anderson S. de Brujin M. Coulson A. Eperon I. Sanger F. Young I. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 683-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar, 2Wolstenholme D. Wolstenholme D. Jeon K. Mitochondrial Genomes. Academic Press, New York1992: 173-216Google Scholar). The protein-synthesizing system of mammalian mitochondria has a number of interesting features not observed in prokaryotes or the cell cytoplasm (3Pel H. Grivell L. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 19: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The mRNAs in this organelle have an almost complete lack of 5′- and 3′-untranslated nucleotides. The start codon is generally located within three nucleotides of the 5′ end of the mRNA (1Anderson S. de Brujin M. Coulson A. Eperon I. Sanger F. Young I. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 683-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar, 4Montoya J. Ojala D. Attardi G. Nature. 1981; 290: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Thus, mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes do not recognize the start codon using the Shine/Dalgarno interaction between the mRNA and the 16 S rRNA as observed in prokaryotes. Further, this system does not use a cap-binding and scanning mechanism such as observed in the eukaryotic cytoplasm. Three translational initiation factors, IF1, IF2, and IF3, 1The abbreviations used are: IF, initiation factor; IF2mt, mitochondrial IF2; IF3mt, mitochondrial IF3; EST, expressed sequence tag; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; CoII, cytochrome oxidase subunit II; N domain, N-terminal domain; C domain, C-terminal domain. are required for the initiation of protein synthesis in bacteria (5Van Knippenberg P.

Similar to its prokaryotic counterpart, IF2mt promotes the binding of fMet-tRNA to the small subunit of mitochondrial ribosomes in response to synthetic polynucleotides such as poly(A,U,G). The current report describes the identification and initial characterization of the mammalian mitochondrial factor equivalent to IF3. In prokaryotes IF3 has a number of roles in the initiation of protein synthesis. IF3 binds to the 30 S subunit and inhibits its association with the 50 S subunit, thus ensuring a supply of 30 S subunits for initiation (13Dottavio-Martin D. Suttle D.P. Ravel J.M. FEBS Lett. 1979; 97: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 14Paci M. Pon C. Lammi M. Gualerzi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9628-9634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IF3 also promotes an adjustment of the position of the mRNA on the 30 S subunit facilitating codon-anticodon interactions between the AUG codon and fMet-tRNA in the P site (15Teana A. Gualerzi C. Brimacombe R. RNA. 1995; 1: 772-782PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hartz D. Binkley J. Hollingsworth T. Gold L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1790-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Sussman J.

Biochem. 1989; 182: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). IF3 acts to switch the decoding preference of the small ribosomal subunit from elongator tRNAs to the initiator tRNA in the P site, thus playing a proofreading role in initiation (19Hartz D. McPheeters D. Gold L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1899-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 20Berkhout B. van der Laken C.J. van Knippenberg P.H. Biochim. Biophys.

IF3 is a small protein of 180 amino acids that folds into two distinct domains separated by a long flexible linker. The C-terminal domain is thought to carry out most of the direct functions of this factor, whereas the N-terminal domain stabilizes the interaction of IF3 with the 30 S subunit (22Petrelli D. LaTeana A. Garofalo C. Spurio R. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4560-4569Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). No factor equivalent to IF1 has been observed in the mitochondria from any system nor can an EST for this protein be identified in the human EST data bases. A gene for IF1 is, however, apparent in many chloroplast genomes. This small protein (less than 90 residues) binds to the 30 S subunit around helix 44 in the region that will become the A site (23Carter A.P. Clemons J. Brodersen D.E. Morgan-Warren R.J. Hartsch T. Wimberly B.T. Ramakrishnan V. Science. 2001; 291: 498-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). By binding to this site, IF1 is postulated to prevent accidental initiation from the A site and to promote the correct positioning of fMet-tRNA in the P site (24Moazed D. Samaha R.R. Gualerzi C.

In the current report, IF3mt has been identified and characterized, and the effects of bacterial IF1 on the function of IF2mt and IF3mt have been investigated.

The genes for E. coli IF3 and IF1 (kindly provided by Drs. Roberto Spurio and Claudio Gualerzi, University of Camerino, Italy, and Dr. Rebecca Alexander, Wake Forest University, respectively) were also amplified by PCR and cloned into pET-21(c). The constructs carryingE. coli IF3 and IF1 were transformed into an E. coli BL21(DE3) strain that also carried the plasmid pArgU218 (kindly provided by Dr. Yamada, Mitsubishi Chemical Corp., Yokohama, Japan). The His-tagged forms of the E. coli initiation factors were purified on Ni-NTA resins as described below. EST and genomic data base searches for human IF3mtwere performed using BLAST (National Center for Biotechnology Information) and the sequences of various prokaryotic IF3s as virtual probes (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nuc. Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis was done using the GCG DNA analysis software package (Wisconsin Package, version 10, Genetics Computer Group, Madison WI), Vector NTI (Informax Inc.), and Biology WorkBench 3.2. The results were displayed using BOXSHADE (written by K. Hofmann and M. Baron). Prediction of the cleavage sites for the mitochondrial signal sequence was carried out using PSort and MitoProt II (31Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar, 32Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 770-786Crossref Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). Protein secondary and tertiary structures were predicted using Internet-based software, PHDsec and SWISS-Model, respectively (33Rost B. Sander C. Schneider R. Comput. Appl. Sci. 1994; 10: 53-60PubMed Google Scholar,34Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA clone in vector pT7T3D-Pac carrying the human mitochondrial IF3mt cDNA was obtained from the American Culture Type Collection (number 526483). The region predicted to be present in the mature form of human IF3mt(residues 32–278) was amplified by PCR using the full-length cDNA as a template. The portion of the IF3mt cDNA predicted to correspond to the mature protein was cloned between theNdeI and XhoI sites of pET-21(c) using the forward primer 5′-CGCGGATCCAATTCATATGGCTGCTTTTTCT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CGCGGATCCGCTCGAGCTGATGCAGAACAT-3′. This vector provides a His tag at the C terminus. The construct carrying the human IF3mt was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying the plasmid pArgU218 (Dr. Yamada, Mitsubishi Chemical Corp., Yokohama, Japan), which provides the gene for the isoacceptor of tRNAArg recognizing the AGA and AGG codons. Induction of IF3mt with 50 μm isopropylthiogalactoside was carried out for 5 h at 37 °C after the cell density had reached 0.5 at OD600. The cells were harvested by low speed centrifugation, and IF3mt was purified through a Ni-NTA column as described (35Woriax V. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Micro-Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Because of the presence of the 19-kDa form of IF3mt found in the Ni-NTA column preparations, a second step of purification was carried out using high performance liquid chromatography. In this procedure, the partially purified IF3mt preparation prepared from 2 liters of cell culture (2 mg/ml, 6 mg) was dialyzed against 100-fold excess of Buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 10 mmMg2Cl, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 225 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol) for 1.5 h. The dialyzed sample was applied at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min to a TSKgel SP-5PW column (7.5 × 75 mm, TosoHas Inc., Japan) that had been equilibrated in Buffer A except that the KCl was adjusted to 240 mm. The column was washed until the absorbance at 280 nm returned to base line. The column was then developed with a linear gradient (50 ml) from 0.24 to 0.30 m KCl in Buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The fractions (0.5 ml) were collected. The fractions containing IF3mt and its major degradation product were pooled separately and fast-frozen in a dry ice isopropyl alcohol bath and stored at −70 °C. The N-terminal sequences of the expressed forms of IF3mt were determined using a Perkin Elmer/ABI Procise model 492 protein/peptide sequencer. The previously described clone carrying the bovine cytochrome oxidase subunit II (CoII) gene (36Liao H.-X. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7518-7522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was modified to provide a sequence of 30 A residues at the 3′ end. The transcript prepared from this vector mimics mitochondrial mRNAs produced in vivo, which generally have poly(A) stretches up to 70 residues added following transcription and processing (37Kisselev O.I. Gaitskhoki V.S. Neifakh S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 4411-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In vitro transcripts were prepared as described previously (36Liao H.-X. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7518-7522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of IF3mt in promoting initiation complex formation withE. coli and mitochondrial ribosomes was assayed using conditions basically described previously (8Liao H.-X. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20714-20719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Liao H.-X. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13618-13622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained 0.5 OD260 units of E. coli70 S or 0.075–0.15 OD260 units of mitochondrial 55 S tight couples, 12.5 μg of poly(A,U,G), or 10 pmol of the CoII mRNA, 3.8 pmol of [35S]fMet-tRNA, and the indicated amounts of various initiation factors. All of the initiation complex formation assays were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and analyzed as described (8Liao H.-X. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20714-20719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures (100 μl) were prepared containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mmMg2+, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.2 OD260units of 55 S ribosomes, and variable amounts of IF3mt(0–1.72 μg). The reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The Mg2+ concentration was then adjusted to 7 mm by the addition of 2.5 μl of 0.1 mMgCl2, and the samples were analyzed for 28, 39, and 55 S particles on 10–30% (w/v) linear sucrose gradients prepared in the buffer described above containing 7 mm Mg2+ and analyzed as described previously (38Spremulli L.L. Kraus B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome has a low percentage of rRNA and a high protein content compared with bacterial ribosomes, portions of the rRNA where IF3 is thought to bind are present (39Dallas A. Noller H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 855-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Further, the ribosomal proteins with which IF3 interacts (S7, S11, and S18) have homologs in the 28 S subunit. Hence, it was logical to postulate that mammalian mitochondria contain a homolog of bacterial IF3. Probing the human ESTs with the amino acid sequence of E. coli or most other IF3 species fails to provide any convincing evidence for a mammalian mitochondrial homolog of IF3. However, extensive data base searches with the sequences of IF3 from the Mycoplasma and the IF3 homology domain of Euglena gracilis chloroplast IF3 provide a hit in both the human and mouse EST data bases. The sequence detected by this search encodes a 278-amino acid protein (Fig. 1 A). MitoProt II gives this protein a 97% probability to be localized in mitochondria and predicts that the mature protein will be 247 residues in length. The mature form of IF3mt is predicted to have an N-terminal extension of about 30 residues (Fig. 1, A andB) that can form a coiled region followed by an α-helix. An N-terminal extension of about 150 residues has been noted onE. gracilis chloroplast IF3 (IF3chl) (40Lin Q., Ma, L. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9436-9444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IF3mt also has a C-terminal extension just over 30 residues long. Overall, it is quite hydrophilic and highly charged having nine acidic and five basic residues. The C-terminal extension, like the N-terminal extension, is predicted to have significant helical content. A 63-residue acidic C-terminal extension on E. gracilis IF3chl has been shown to reduce the activity on the chloroplast factor in initiation complex formation and may serve as a potential regulatory region (41Yu N.-J. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3871-3877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Figure 1Sequence and domain organization of IF3mt.

The full sequence of the F. rubripes IF3mt is not shown for convenience.D, alignment of human IF3mt with the putative IF3mt from S. pombe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Alignment of IF3mt with prokaryotic and chloroplast IF3 indicates that the mitochondrial factor has diverged considerably from other IF3s (Table I). Overall, it has only 20.8% identity to E. coli IF3, which explains the failure of data base searches with the sequence of E. coliIF3 to locate the corresponding mitochondrial factor. IF3mtis 25.9% and 23.7% identical to Bacillus stearothermophilus IF3 and to E. gracilis chloroplast IF3, respectively (40Lin Q., Ma, L. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9436-9444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alignment of the sequence of IF3mtwith the bacterial factors indicates that regions of identity are rather scattered throughout the structure (Fig. 1 B). Residues that are responsible for the binding of IF3 to the small subunit are thought to be located primarily in the C-terminal domain. Crystallography experiments place the C-terminal domain of IF3 on the solvent side of the platform on the 30 S subunit (42Pioletti M. Schlunzen F. Harms J. Zarivach R. Gluhmann M. Avila H. Bashan A. Bartels H. Auerbach T. Jacobi C. Hartsch T. Yonath A. Franceschi F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1829-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), whereas cryo electron microscopy and footprinting suggest that it is located on the interface side (39Dallas A. Noller H.F.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4301-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Important regions of IF3 include residues 99–116, 127–137, 145–155, and 168 (E. coli numbering) as indicated by NMR experiments, mutagenesis, and structural studies (39Dallas A. Noller H.F. Mol.

RNA. 1999; 5: 82-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A number of the residues in these regions are conserved or are conservative replacements in the C-terminal domain of human IF3mt.Table IPercentage of identity of human mitochondrial IF3 homologsOrganismIdentityLengthAccession number%B. stearothermophilus25.9172P03000Mycoplasma genitalium24.6184P47438Mycoplasma pneumoniae21.5201NP_109803E. coli20.8180P02999E. gracilis (chloroplast)23.7538L23760A. thaialana (chloroplast)24.4312NP_179984S. pombe aPutative mitochondrial initiation factor 3.20.9233T39948S. cerevisiae aPutative mitochondrial initiation factor 3.16.2370NP_011356B. taurus(mitochondrial)69.5273cDNAsbcDNA sequences encoding for bovine IF3mt: AW658739 (nucleotides 316–582, aa residues 1–89), AW445348 (nucleotides 1–408, aa residues 26–161), BM106922(nucleotides 270–112, aa residues 149–201), and BM255983 (nucleotides 79–360, aa residues 180–273).Mouse (mitochondrial)66.0276BAB28438Drosophila (mitochondrial)22.6226AAF58534F. rubripes(mitochondrial)30.9362JGI_17846The percentage identity between human IF3mt and the bacterial factors is reported for the homology region only.a Putative mitochondrial initiation factor 3.b cDNA sequences encoding for bovine IF3mt: AW658739 (nucleotides 316–582, aa residues 1–89), AW445348 (nucleotides 1–408, aa residues 26–161), BM106922(nucleotides 270–112, aa residues 149–201), and BM255983 (nucleotides 79–360, aa residues 180–273). Open table in a new tab The percentage identity between human IF3mt and the bacterial factors is reported for the homology region only. One of the major roles of prokaryotic IF3 is the discrimination of the initiation codon (AUG or occasionally GUG or UUG) from other codons. This property can be observed in the isolated C-terminal domain of bacterial IF3 (22Petrelli D. LaTeana A. Garofalo C. Spurio R. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4560-4569Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) but is strongly affected by conserved residues in the linker region (17Sussman J. Simons E. Simons R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 347-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 45de Cock E. Springer M. Dardel F. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 288: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these highly conserved residues, Tyr70, Gly71, and Tyr75, in prokaryotic IF3s are not conserved in human IF3mt. In mammalian mitochondria, both AUG and AUA (normally an isoleucine codon) serve as initiation codons. Consequently, the proofreading properties of human IF3mt could be quite different from those of the bacterial factors. Analysis of the mouse and bovine EST data bases indicates the presence of mammalian homologs of human IF3mt that are 65–70% identical to the human factor (Table I and Fig. 1 C). In addition, BLAST searches indicate the presence of IF3mt inFugu rubripes (puffer fish) and in Drosophila melanogaster (Table I and Fig. 1 C). No homolog can be detected in Caenorhabditis elegans. It is quite reasonable to assume that this organism will have a corresponding factor. However, IF3mt does not appear to be highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom, and it may be difficult to detect using BLAST searches. The IF3mt species detected in animals generally have N- and C-terminal extensions that surround a central section that has homology to the bacterial IF3s. The N-terminal extension on puffer fish IF3mt is considerably longer than that observed on the mammalian factors (Fig. 1 C). D. melanogasterIF3mt has a very short N-terminal extension. The mammalian and puffer fish IF3mts all have C-terminal extensions of around 30 residues compared with the bacterial IF3s. However, D. melanogaster IF3mt again lacks a significant extension at the C terminus. The linker regions of the mitochondrial factors are charged as observed for the prokaryotic proteins. Two potential homologs of IF3mt can be found inArabidopsis thaliana. One of these genes probably encodes the chloroplast factor, whereas the other encodes the mitochondrial factor. These two forms (NP-179984 and NP-174696) differ considerably in length (312 and 574 residues, respectively). Alignments of these two species with E. gracilis chloroplast IF3 suggests that the shorter form is more likely to encode the chloroplast factor based on the percentage of identity. However, the shorter form also has a higher percentage of identity to human IF3mt than the longer form, making it difficult to assign these two species clearly to one or the other compartments. Cyberprobing of the recently completed genome ofSchizosaccharomyces pombe allows the tentative identification of IF3mt in this organism (47Wood V. Gwilliam R. Rajandream M.A. Lyne M. Lyne R.

The protein encoded by this gene is 20.9% identical to human IF3mt and 25% identical to E. coli IF3 (Table I and Fig.1 D). If the predicted import signal is cleaved from S. pombe IF3mt, no N-terminal extension would be present. IF3mt from S. pombe does not have any observable C-terminal extension. Searching the genome ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae with the sequence of human IF3mt fails to indicate the presence of a yeast homolog.

The CaR forms disulfide-linked dimers (1Bai M. Trivedi S. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23605-23610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and can be activated allosterically by l-amino acids in the presence of Ca2+o in the millimolar concentration range of 0.1–10 mm with a preference for aromatic and small aliphatic l-amino acids (2Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4814-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Moreover, these amino acids stereoselectively enhance the sensitivity of the CaR to its agonists including Ca2+o and spermine. The CaR is widely distributed in the upper gastrointestinal tract including gastrin-secreting G cells and may mediate physiological responses including the release of gastric acid and pancreatic enzymes upon the ingestion of protein and free amino acids in the diet (3Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 401-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, the CaR may serve as a fundamental link between protein and Ca2+o metabolism. It has been documented that these two homeostatic systems are intimately related. For instance, a reduction in protein intake below the normal level results in secondary hyperparathyroidism in the context of normocalcemia (4Kerstetter J.E. Caseria D.M. Mitnick M.E. Ellison A.F.

For the rat homolog of mGluR1a, the key residues involved in the binding of glutamate to its ECD have been identified through the determination of its crystal structure when it is complexed with glutamate (11Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Ser-164, Ser-165, Thr-188, and Glu-292 form hydrogen bonds with the α-carboxyl group in glutamate. Five residues, Ser-186, Thr-188, Asp-208, Tyr-236, and Asp-318, form additional hydrogen bonds with the α-amino group of glutamate. Of these residues, Ser-165, Thr-188, Asp-208, Tyr-236, and Asp-318 in the mGluR1a are conserved in the CaR, corresponding to Ser-147, Ser-170, Asp-190, Tyr-218, and Glu-297, respectively. The γ-carboxyl group in glutamate forms one hydrogen bond each with Lys-409 and Arg-323 in mGluR1a; however, these two positively charged amino acid residues are not conserved in the CaR. Mutations S165A and T188A have been reported to impair glutamate binding and resultant activation of mGluR1a (10O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thogersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), whereas the functional significance of other residues in the glutamate binding site of the mGluRs have not been reported. Previous studies of the CaR have shown that substitutions of amino acids such as Ser-147 and Ser-170, which correspond to Ser-165 and Thr-188 in mGluR1a, markedly reduce activation of the receptor by Ca2+o (13Brauner-Osborne H. Jensen A.A. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18382-18386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, the mutations of Tyr-218 and Glu-297 in the CaR that correspond to Tyr-236 and Asp-318 in mGluR1a produce familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) in humans (14Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Receptors harboring these two mutations are not responsive to physiological concentrations of Ca2+o. Therefore, 4 of the 5 residues in the CaR conserved with the mGluRs appear important for the responsiveness of the CaR to its physiological agonist Ca2+o. In the present studies, we tested the hypothesis that the CaR is modulated by l-amino acids through a putative binding site similar to the glutamate binding site in the ECD of mGluR1a. We examined the roles of these conserved amino acids in mediating the action of the aromatic l-amino acid phenylalanine. We found that one of the conserved residues, Ser-170, is critical for functional modulation of the CaR by phenylalanine. Site-directed mutagenesis employed the approach described by Kunkel (10O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thogersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) to produce mutated receptors in which one or more serine residues at positions 147 and 169–171 as well as Asp-190 and Tyr-218 in the ECD of the human CaR were mutated to alanines. The dut-1 ung-1 strain of Escherichia coli, CJ236, was transformed separately with mutagenesis cassettes as described previously (7Nakanishi S. Science. 1992; 258: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar). Uracil-containing single-stranded DNA was produced by infecting the cells with the helper phage VCSM13 (Stratagene). The single-stranded DNA was then annealed to a mutagenesis primer that contained the desired nucleotide change encoding single or multiple point mutations flanked on both sides by wild-type sequences. The primer was subsequently extended around the entire single-stranded DNA and ligated to generate closed circular heteroduplex DNA. DH5α or DH10B competent cells were transformed with these DNA heteroduplexes, and the incorporation of the desired mutations was confirmed by sequencing the mutated cassettes. The resultant mutated cassettes were cloned into the FLAG-tagged receptor in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) as described previously (7Nakanishi S. Science. 1992; 258: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar). The DNA for transfection was prepared with the plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen). LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) was employed as a DNA carrier for transfection (11Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). The HEK293 cells used for transient transfection were provided by NPS Pharmaceuticals (Salt Lake City, UT) and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). The DNA-liposome complex was prepared by mixing DNA and LipofectAMINE in Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen) and incubating the mixture at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA-LipofectAMINE mixture was then diluted with Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium and added to 90% confluent HEK293 cells plated on 13.5 × 20.1-mm glass coverslips using 2.5 μg of DNA. After the cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C, equivalent amounts of Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium with 20% fetal bovine serum were added to the medium overlaying the transfected cells, and the latter was replaced with fresh Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum 24 h after transfection. The expressed CaR protein was assayed 48 h after the start of transfection. To co-express two receptors, 1.25 μg of each of the two cDNAs was mixed and used to transfect HEK293 cells. Before whole cell lysates were prepared, intact HEK293 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged CaR were labeled with 1 mm ImmunoPure Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce), a membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent as described previously (1Bai M. Trivedi S. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23605-23610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The surface-biotinylated HEK293 cells were solubilized, and the FLAG-tagged receptor was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). The immunopurified species were subsequently eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE (12Hammerland L.G. Krapcho K.J. Garrett J.E. Alasti N. Hung B.C. Simin R.T. Levinthal C. Nemeth E.F. Fuller F.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 642-648PubMed Google Scholar) using a linear gradient of polyacrylamide (3–10%). The forms of the receptor present on the cell surface were detected with an avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) followed by visualization of the biotinylated bands with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Coverslips with HEK293 cells previously transfected with the appropriate CaR cDNAs were loaded for 2 h at room temperature with Fura-2/AM in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 125 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% dextrose and then washed once with a bath solution (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 125 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% dextrose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C for 20 min. The coverslips were then placed diagonally in a thermostated quartz cuvette that contained the bath solution using a modification of the technique employed previously in this laboratory (13Brauner-Osborne H. Jensen A.A. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18382-18386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Phenylalanine was added to the bath solution and preincubated for 50 s. Concentrated Ca2+o at 100 mm or 1 m was added stepwise to an experimental solution containing 0.5 mm Ca2+ to achieve the following concentrations: 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mm. Because phenylalanine was not included in the concentrated Ca2+o solutions, the initial phenylalanine concentration was sequentially diluted by the 11 additions of Ca2+o from 9.9 to 9.13 mm. Excitation monochrometers were centered at 340 and 380 nm, and emission light was collected at 510 ± 40 nm through a wide band emission filter. The 340/380 excitation ratio of emitted light was used to estimate Ca2+i as described previously (13Brauner-Osborne H. Jensen A.A. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18382-18386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The activities of the wild-type and mutant CaRs were determined in response to increasing concentrations of Ca2+o in the presence or absence of phenylalanine. The mean responses at various concentrations of Ca2+o were calculated from individual experiments and were expressed with the standard error of the mean (±S.E.) as the index of dispersion. The comparison of responses of various receptors at 50 mm Ca2+o was performed using ANOVA or Duncan’s multiple comparison test (p ≤ 0.05) (8Pin J.P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). Each of the experiments presented in the results was performed at least three times. To calculate the EC50 value and the maximal response, we used the MacFitCurve program and the Hill equation, F(X) = a·Xh/(eh +Xh)where “F” is function, “a” is maximal response, “e” is EC50, and “h” is Hill coefficient to fit the experimental data. Fig. 1 shows the segments of the CaR and mGluR1a containing the five conserved residues in their putative amino acid binding sites. The conserved residues are marked withfilled dots. Ser-165, Thr-188, Asp-208, Tyr-236, and Asp-318 in mGluR1a align with Ser-147, Ser-170, Asp-190, Tyr-218, and Glu-297 in the CaR, respectively. Many naturally occurring inactivating mutations causing FHH in humans alter amino acids conserved in the mGluRs including those close to or involved in the glutamate binding site in mGluR1a. Among them, Tyr-218 and Glu-297 correspond to Tyr-236 and Asp-318 in mGluR1a, which are in direct contact with the α-amino group of glutamate. Tyr-218 and Glu-297 were altered to serine and lysine, respectively, in two kindreds with FHH (14Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J.

Invest. 1996; 98: 1860-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These two mutations, E297K and Y218S, markedly reduce the responsiveness and sensitivity of the receptor to Ca2+o (Fig.2B and C and TableI). The responses of these two mutants did not reach their maximal values at concentrations of Ca2+o as high as 50 mm. In contrast, the wild-type receptor reached its maximal response at 20 mm Ca2+o. Moreover, the responses of these two mutants at 50 mm Ca2+o were approximately 13 and 22%, respectively, of that of the wild-type receptor. Pretreatment with 10 mm phenylalanine increased the magnitude of the high Ca2+o (50 mm) elicited responses of these mutant receptors by 2.3- and 3.5-fold, respectively, for Y218S and E297K (Fig. 2 and Table I). Likewise, the activity of the mutant receptor carrying R185Q, another FHH mutation located outside of the putative amino acid binding site, was also significantly increased by pretreatment of phenylalanine (Fig.2D and Table I). These results suggest that Glu-297 and Tyr-218 are not crucial for the actions of phenylalanine on the CaR.Figure 2Effects of the naturally occurring mutations Y218S, E297K, and R185Q on the responsiveness of the CaR to phenylalanine. HEK293 cells were transfected with the wild-type CaR (A), Y218S (B), E297K(C), or R185Q (D) and loaded with Fura-2. Changes in the emission ratio (340/380 excitation) were measured to assess Ca2+o-evoked Ca2+i responses. Prior to the addition of Ca2+o, cells were exposed (triangle) or not exposed (circle) to 10 mm phenylalanine. Responses are normalized to the maximal cumulative Ca2+i responses of the wild-type receptor in non-treated cells. Each point is the mean value for the number of measurements indicated in Table I.

Open table in a new tab To examine whether other conserved residues in the glutamate binding site, namely Ser-147, Ser-170, and Asp-190, play roles in the modulation of the CaR by phenylalanine and to better test Tyr-218, these residues were mutated to alanines, and the resultant mutant receptors were tested to determine their responsiveness to phenylalanine. As shown in Fig. 3, all of these mutations substantially attenuated CaR-mediated Ca2+i responses. 10 mm phenylalanine significantly increased the activation of the CaR in each case with S170A showing the smallest increase (Fig. 3B). In addition, S147A, D190A, and Y218A each exhibited a significant increase in its sensitivity to Ca2+o as indicated by a decline in the EC50 value in the presence of l-Phe (TableI). However, there was no significant decrease in the EC50for the S170A substitution. These results suggested that replacement of serine at position 170 significantly compromised the interaction of the CaR with phenylalanine. In the CaR, Ser-170 is flanked by two additional serines at positions 169 and 171 with Ser-171 also being conserved in mGluR1a. Consistent with a previous report (9Nakanishi S. Nakajima Y. Masu M. Ueda Y. Nakahara K. Watanabe D. Yamaguchi S. Kawabata S. Okada M. Brain Res. 1998; 26: 230-235Crossref Scopus (292) Google Scholar), the mutation S171A significantly reduced the affinity of the CaR to Ca2+o but not its maximal response, whereas the mutation S169A only slightly decreased the maximal response (Table I). Phenylalanine potentiated both S169A and S171A (Table I). We tested whether multiple alanine substitutions of serines at positions 169 and 171 in addition to S170A would further reduce the responsiveness of the CaR to phenylalanine when combined as double or triple mutations. S170A/S171A, S169A/S170A, and S169A/S170A/S171A each further attenuated the CaR-mediated Ca2+i responses (Fig.4 and Table I). These combinations of mutations markedly reduced the responsiveness of the receptor to 10 mm phenylalanine (Fig. 4 and Table I). In fact, the activity of S169A/S170A/S171A is slightly lower in the presence of phenylalanine than in its absence (Fig. 4C). Our results suggest that these three serines cooperatively interact with phenylalanine. Like many other ECD mutants such as E297K, the responsiveness of S169A/S170A/S171A to Ca2+o could be reconstituted by co-transfecting with the inactive truncated receptor A877Stop (Fig.5 and Table I), suggesting that the intracellular domains of the triple serine mutant were fully functional. However, the heterodimer formed in cells co-transfected with S169A/S170A/S171A and A877Stop did not respond to 10 mm phenylalanine (Fig. 5B and Table I), suggesting that the mutant receptor containing these three serines replaced by alanines has a dominant negative effect on the responsiveness to phenylalanine of its dimeric partner. In contrast, the heterodimer formed in cells co-transfected with E297K and A877Stop responded to 10 mm phenylalanine (Fig. 5A and Table I) We also examined two additional mutant receptors, G143E and G549R, which do not respond to Ca2+o at concentrations as high as 50 mm (Table I). Like R185Q, these mutations are in the ECD but not in the putative amino acid binding site. Both residues are conserved in mGluR1a with the residue corresponding to Gly-143 located close to the glutamate binding site in mGluR1a, whereas the residue corresponding to Gly-549 is not. This latter residue was excluded from the portion of mGluR1a used for x-ray structural determination by Kunishima et al. (11Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), suggesting that this residue in mGluR1a is not essential for glutamate binding. However, these two mutant receptors, G143E and G549R, remained totally inactive even in the presence of 10 mmphenylalanine (Table I). It appears that Ca2+responsiveness may be required for the action of phenylalanine on the receptor. We next tested whether phenylalanine responsiveness could be reconstituted by co-transfecting these inactive ECD mutants with an inactive cytoplasmic tail-truncated receptor A877Stop containing a normal ECD. As shown in Fig. 6,A and B, high Ca2+o elicited substantial Ca2+i responses in cells co-transfected either with G143E and A877Stop (G143E&A877Stop) or with G549R and A877Stop (G549R&A877Stop). 10 mm phenylalanine had only a minimal effect on these heterodimers. The maximal responses were slightly increased, whereas their EC50 values were slightly decreased (Table I). Therefore, in these two types of heterodimeric receptors, phenylalanine responsiveness is poorly restored. As a result, phenylalanine responsiveness of both monomers may be required for the action of phenylalanine on the resultant heterodimer. Besides the mutations in the ECD, we also examined the effect of R795W, an FHH mutation in the third intracellular loop, on phenylalanine-mediated potentiation of the CaR. As reported in our previous study (14Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), the mutant receptor R795W has substantially attenuated Ca2+i responses (Fig.7A and Table I). The mutation presumably blocks the receptor from activating its cognate G proteins since its activity can be reconstituted by co-transfecting with inactive receptors having mutations in the ECD. Consistently, the mutant receptor was not significantly more active in the presence of 10 mm phenylalanine than in its absence. To determine whether R795W would facilitate phenylalanine modulation when present as one of the monomeric subunits in a heterodimeric receptor, we co-transfected R795W with E297K (responsive to phenylalanine) or with G143E (unresponsive to phenylalanine). Co-transfection of R795W and E297K or R795W and G143E each substantially reconstituted receptor responsiveness to Ca2+o. In addition, E297K&R795W responded to phenylalanine with a substantial increase in maximal response and a 30% decrease in EC50 (Fig. 7B and Table I). These results suggest that R795W may participate in the binding of Ca2+o as well as the binding of phenylalanine. In contrast, R795W&G143E (Fig. 7C) did not respond to phenylalanine. Again, G143E showed a dominant negative effect on the response of the resultant heterodimeric receptor to phenylalanine in co-transfected cells. Western analysis showed that the mutations in the receptors constructed in this study had little effect on the cell surface expression of the receptor with the exception of S169A/S170A/S171A in which a reduction in surface expression was observed (Fig.8A). However, the reduction in receptor expression is not the cause for the significant reduction in the response of S169A/S170A/S171A to Ca2+o and phenylalanine, because S169A/S170A/S171A in cells co-transfected with A877Stop had a 4.5-fold higher Ca2+i response at 50 mm Ca2+o than that in singly transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 8B, the receptor in co-transfected cells had a level of expression similar to that in singly transfected cells. The finding that the CaR can function as a stereoselective receptor for aromatic and other l-amino acids draws it closer functionally to the mGluRs than previously considered (2Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4814-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The mGluRs are activated by the negatively charged amino acid glutamate at concentrations in the submillimolar range and can also be activated by millimolar concentrations of Ca2+o (16Kubo Y. Miyashita T. Murata Y. Science. 1998; 279: 1722-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The CaR can be activated by Ca2+o and l-amino acids (2Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4814-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar); however, it requires the presence of greater than one millimolar concentrations of Ca2+o in the bath solution for l-amino acids to be effective. In addition, the CaR responds to a large number of l-amino acids, exhibiting a preference for aromatic l-amino acids but with substantially lower affinities than those found with the mGluRs for glutamate. The glutamate binding sites in the mGluRs have been located in their ECDs (11Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 17Takahashi K. Tsuchida K. Tanabe Y. Masu M. Nakanishi S. J. Biol.

Five residues (Ser-165, Thr-188, Asp-208, Tyr-236, and Asp-318) in rat mGluR1a, which are in direct contact with α-amino and α-carboxyl groups in glutamate, are conserved in the CaR (Ser-147, Ser-170, Asp-190, Tyr-218, and Glu-297) (11Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). We found that one of them, Ser-170 (corresponding to Thr-188), is critical for mediating functional modulation of the CaR by phenylalanine. With added phenylalanine, the CaR with a single mutation S170A shows no significant change in its EC50 for Ca2+o stimulation and less than a 1.6-fold increase in its response at 50 mm Ca2+o. In addition, double (S169A/S170A and S170A/S171A) and triple mutations (S169A/S170A/S171A), which include S170A, demonstrated little change in the activity of the CaR in the presence of phenylalanine. These results suggest that modulatory l-amino acids may interact with the CaR in a location similar to the binding site of glutamate in the mGluRs. Unlike Ser-170, the four other conserved residues, Ser-147, Asp-190, Tyr-218, and Glu-297, do not appear to be important for phenylalanine binding, because single residue replacements do not reduce phenylalanine modulation of the CaR. However, we have not examined mutational combinations of these residues. It is possible that a single mutation may not result in a substantial change in receptor function despite its involvement in phenylalanine binding. The studies of the mGluRs do not provide a guide to the interpretation of our studies on receptor function. Most residues in the glutamate binding sites of the mGluRs, which have been identified by the crystal structure of mGluR-glutamate complexes, have not been functionally tested to understand the impact that single mutations have on agonist binding. The putative amino acid binding site of the CaR may lie in close proximity to key Ca2+o binding sites in its ECD, because alteration of numerous residues in this region substantially attenuates the response of the receptor to Ca2+o. For instance, mutant receptors carrying the substitutions S147A, S170A, D190A, Y218S, Y218A, and E297K exhibit no responses to physiological concentrations of Ca2+o (under 5 mm), and the apparent affinities of the receptors for Ca2+o are decreased by more than 6-fold. In this study, we found that phenylalanine potentiates the maximal responses of many mutant receptors but does not do so for the wild-type receptor. In some cases, phenylalanine not only increases the maximal responses of the mutant receptors but also decreases their EC50s. For instance, S147A has its maximal response increased by 1.75-fold and has its EC50 decreased by 0.55-fold. In the case of other mutants, phenylalanine only increases the maximal responses without affecting the EC50s. For instance, S170A has its maximal response increased by 1.6-fold with its EC50 essentially unchanged. Interestingly, the potentiating effects of phenylalanine on the maximal response and EC50of a mutant CaR appear to be independent, depending on the particular mutation examined. However, at present we have no molecular explanation for this phenomenon. With the notable exception of Ser-170, the residues that support phenylalanine-mediated potentiation of the CaR appear to be distinct from those that directly contact glutamate in mGluRs. For instance, Gly-143 in the CaR corresponds Gly-161 in mGluR1a, which is situated in lobe I close to the glutamate binding site but not part of this site. In the CaR, the G143E substitution has been identified in individuals with FHH, and in vitro studies show that a CaR harboring this mutation is completely inactive in response to Ca2+o (14Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The glycine residue has no side chainper se and is unlikely to directly interact with Ca2+o or l-amino acids. However, glycine residues are often important for the overall structure of a protein as they introduce structural breaks in α-helixes or β-sheets. Thus, the replacement of a glycine residue could severely disturb the structure of the protein and affect its stability. Indeed, we found that G143E is expressed at much lower levels on the cell surface than the wild-type receptor (14Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C.

A. 1999; 96: 2834-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and this mutation has diminished responsiveness to phenylalanine. Thus, one mechanism for diminishing the modulation of the receptor by phenylalanine could be through indirect disturbance of the structure of the amino acid binding site in the receptor. Our previous studies have shown that the CaR exists mainly as a dimer on the cell surface of the CaR-transfected HEK293 cells and that this dimer is covalently linked by disulfide bonds (4Kerstetter J.E. Caseria D.M. Mitnick M.E. Ellison A.F. Gay L.F. Liskov T.A. Carpenter T.O. Insogna K.L. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1997; 66: 1188-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Importantly, we have previously demonstrated the presence of domain complementation in certain heterodimeric receptors that can exhibit substantial recovery of function when compared with either of the mutant homodimers by themselves (19Bai M. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2834-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For instance, the mutant receptors, G143E and A877Stop, hardly respond to Ca2+o as homodimers. In contrast, the heterodimeric receptors resulting from co-transfection of G143E and A877Stop regain 60% of maximal response of the wild-type CaR to Ca2+o. In this study, we found that domain complementation in some heterodimeric receptors produced partial recovery of Ca2+o responsiveness but not of modulation by phenylalanine. In particular, co-transfection of S169A/S170A/S171A with A877Stop resulted in a substantial response to Ca2+o but no positive modulation by phenylalanine. This inability to recover phenylalanine modulation may suggest that a simultaneous action of the amino acid on each monomeric subunit is required for the potentiation of CaR activation by Ca2+o. However, such cooperative behavior is not corroborated by the Hill coefficient of 1 found for phenylalanine modulation of the wild-type receptor (2Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4814-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the amino acid binding site in the truncated receptor does not function properly or that a single phenylalanine binding site is formed by both of the monomeric subunits where both Ser-170 residues together with nearby amino acids act to form the amino acid binding pocket. In conclusion, phenylalanine binds to the CaR in its ECD. At least one residue, Ser-170, homologous to a conserved residue in the glutamate binding site of mGluR1a, appears critical for this CaR modulation by phenylalanine. Both monomeric subunits of the dimeric receptor appear to be required for the full phenylalanine effect on the activation of the CaR by its physiological agonist, Ca2+o. Phenylalanine retains its ability to potentiate receptor activation in the presence of many different mutations in the Ca2+o binding region of the CaR. Interestingly, phenylalanine is capable of increasing the maximal responsiveness to Ca2+o as well as Ca2+o sensitivity for many FHH-inducing mutations. Thus, plasma amino acid levels might limit the severity of some FHH phenotypes in vivo."

Previous studies demonstrated that a mechanical force, cyclic strain, increases MT1-MMP expression by displacing Sp1 with increased Egr-1 expression and binding to the promoter site. However, the effect of shear stress (SS) on MT1-MMP expression is poorly understood. Although Egr-1 mRNA transcription and protein was induced (7.6-fold) in response to SS (n = 5, 0–8 h, p < 0.05), SS decreased MT1-MMP mRNA transcription and protein levels in a time-dependent fashion (10, 50, and 90% reduction at 1, 4, and 8 h, respectively; n = 5, p< 0.05). Egr-1 protein was increased after SS and cyclic strain, but Sp1 was serine-phosphorylated only after SS. SS increased Sp1 DNA binding (3.8-, 5.8-, and 2.4-fold increase at 1, 4, and 8 h, respectively; n = 5, p < 0.05) that was inhibitable by calf intestinal phosphatase. Thus, SS inhibits MT1-MMP expression despite Egr-1 up-regulation by inducing the serine phosphorylation of Sp1, which in turn increases its binding affinity for its site on the MT1-MMP promoter, reducing the ability of Egr-1 to displace it. These data illustrate the complex control of microvascular endothelial cell MT1-MMP expression in response to distinct environmental stimuli (cyclic strain versus shear stress), consisting of both the modulation of specific transcription factor expression (Egr-1) as well as transcription factor post-translational modification (serine phosphorylation of Sp1).

The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of structurally related zinc endopeptidases capable of proteolysis of numerous components of the extracellular matrix (5Woessner J.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Production and activation of MMPs correlate strongly with migration and invasion in endothelium (6Birkedal-Hansen H. Curr.

Membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, MMP-14), one of the members of the family of matrix-bound MMPs by a C-terminal transmembrane domain, is identified as a physiological activator of pro-MMP-2 on the cell surface as well as a functional enzyme that degrades a number of extracellular matrix components (8Sato H.

It is not surprising that MT1-MMP has been shown to be a key regulator of angiogenesis (10Hiraoka N. Allen E. Apel I.J. Gyetko M.R. Weiss S.J.

MT1-MMP mRNA and protein levels are expressed at low levels in most noninvasive cells but are up-regulated during EC migration and matrix remodeling, and this up-regulation correlates with MMP-2 activation (11Sato H.

The up-regulation of MT1-MMP mRNA and protein occurs in microvascular EC cultured in a three-dimensional collagen type-I matrix as a consequence of increased production and promoter binding of the transcription factor early growth response (Egr-1) (12Haas T.L.

Egr-1 is a key regulator of MT1-MMP activation and is involved in the differentiation to a migratory and invasive endothelial phenotype (13Haas T.L. Stitelman D. Davis S.J. Apte S.S. Madri J.A. J.

However, the regulation of MT1-MMP expression and the mechanism of its activation induced by environmental forces are not well understood. We demonstrated previously (14Yamaguchi S. Yamaguchi M. Yatsuyanagi E. Yun S.S. Nakajima N. Madri J.A. Sumpio B. Lab. Invest. 2002; 82: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that cyclic strain induced up-regulation of MT1-MMP mRNA and protein in microvascular EC. We also demonstrated that a GC-rich sequence between −288 and −275 in the promoter contains overlapping consensus binding sites for Sp1 and Egr-1, and increasing levels of Egr-1 displace the basal transcription factor Sp1 from the MT1-MMP promoter, resulting in a significantly greater rate of transcription (13Haas T.L.

Other studies have shown that fluid shear stress increases Egr-1 expression but decreases MT1-MMP mRNA and protein expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (15Palumbo R. Gaetano C. Melillo G. Toschi E. Remuzzi A. Capogrossi M.C. Circulation. 2000; 102: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigate the regulation of MT1-MMP expression in microvessel EC by shear stress and the roles of the transcription factors Egr-1 and Sp1 in this process. Rat microvascular EC were harvested from the epididymal fat pads of Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured as described previously (16Madri J.A. Williams S.K. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Twelve rats were used per preparation, and experiments were performed on two separate isolations of cells. Briefly, cells were grown on gelatin-coated tissue culture plates (1.5% gelatin in phosphate-buffered saline) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 25% sterile-filtered conditioned bovine aortic EC medium and 10% fetal bovine serum. For all experiments, EC were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and antibiotics (penicillin 100 units/ml, streptomycin 100 μg/ml, and amphotericin B 250 ng/ml (Invitrogen)) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 on type I collagen-coated 35-mm 6-well culture dishes at 37 °C. Serum-containing medium was replaced by serum-free medium 24 h prior to each experiment. Cells were synchronized by serum-starving for 24 h. Shear stress was applied to confluent cultures with an orbital shaker (Lab-Line, Melrose Park, IL) (17Ley K. Lundgren E. Berger E. Arfors K.E.

Although this technique does not result in uniform application of laminar shear stress across the entire monolayer, the majority of the cells are exposed to near-maximal shear stress (τmax), which can be calculated as shown in Equation1, τmax=a√ρη¯(2πf)3Equation 1 where a is the radius of orbital rotation (1.4 cm); ρ is the density of the culture medium (1.0 g/ml); η is the viscosity of the medium (0.0075 poise measured by viscometer); andf is the frequency of rotation (rotations/s). A shaking frequency of 270 rpm results in a shear stress of 14 dynes/cm2, which is a normal level in arteries. EC were seeded on flexible silicon membranes coated with type I collagen (Flex-Cell International Corp, McKeesport, PA) and synchronized as described above. EC were exposed to cyclic strain using a Flexercell Strain Unit (Flexcell FX-3000 system; Flex-Cell International Corp.), which consists of a vacuum manifold with recessed ports controlled by computer program. The apparatus has been extensively characterized and utilized. The cyclic strain regimen was carried out utilizing 150 mm Hg vacuum deformation at 60 cycles/min, resulting in 24% maximum strain. EC were lysed, and total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration and relative purity were quantified by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm and the ratio of absorbance at 260 nm relative to that at 280 nm. Twenty five μg of RNA were denatured by heating and then loaded and separated on a 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde, prior to transfer to a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by capillary blotting using 10× standard saline citrate (SSC: 1.5m sodium chloride, 0.15 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0). Hybridization was performed with probes constructed from the Egr-1 expression vector and from human MT1-MMP cDNA (12Haas T.L. Davis S.J. Madri J.A. J. Biol.

Blots were then washed twice in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature and then once in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 65 °C. Bands were visualized by standard autoradiography techniques with X-Omat AR Film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Blots were stripped and reprobed with a GAPDH probe (ATCC, Manassas, VA) to normalize for RNA loading. Whole cell extracts prepared from EC were lysed in 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The extracts were heat-denatured in Laemmli sample buffer, size-fractionated in a 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (AmershamBiosciences). After blocking for 1 h with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS) and 5% nonfat dry milk, the blots were exposed to polyclonal antibodies to MT1-MMP (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA), Egr-1, or Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). After rinsing three times for 15 min in TTBS, the blot was incubated with a 1:2,000 dilution of anti-rabbit IgGs and anti-mouse IgGs for 1 h. After three additional 15-min rinses in TTBS, the resulting protein-antibody complexes were detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Confluent cells a from 35-mm 6-well culture dish were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and scraped into 600 μl of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× Complete mixture, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate). The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min, and 150 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added. After additional incubation for 5 min on ice and centrifugation (1,200 rpm), the supernatant was discarded. The crude nuclear pellet was resuspended and incubated for 30 min in 60 μl of hypertonic solution (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× Complete mixture, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate) for high salt extraction. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C (12,000 rpm), and the glycerol was added to the supernatant (final concentration, 10% (v/v)). The protein concentration of the extract was determined using the Bio-Rad reagent (Bio-Rad), and extracts were used immediately in EMSA reactions or stored at −80 °C. Consensus Sp1 and Egr-1 binding double-stranded oligonucleotides, and mutated oligonucleotides (synthesized by Oligonucleotide Synthesis Facility, Yale University) of the MT1-MMP promoter were annealed and end-labeled using [32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The probe was purified using Quick SpinTM columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Ten micrograms of nuclear extract were incubated in a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 500 ng of salmon sperm DNA, and radiolabeled probe (5 × 104 cpm) with or without unlabeled oligonucleotide competitors at 25 °C. For supershift analysis, 2 μl of the Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were added to the reaction and incubated for 15 min prior to gel loading. Nuclear extracts were pretreated with 10 milliunits of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) (Promega, Madison, WI) for 30 min at 25 °C in EMSA buffer prior to adding the probe. Reactions were electrophoresed on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 45 mm Tris base, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA followed by autoradiography. EC were washed three times with cold PBS and scraped into 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg of leupeptin per ml). The cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with rotation. After centrifugation for 15 min, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube, and the extract was precleared with 20 μl of protein G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h with rotation. The beads were pelleted, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and 20 μl of protein G PLUS-agarose beads conjugated to Sp1-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added. Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C with rotation, after which the immunoprecipitated proteins were washed four times with lysis buffer. After the last wash, the beads were resuspended in 12.5 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-phosphoserine-specific antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Serine-phosphorylated Sp1 was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescent system as described above. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. The Student's t test was used for analyzing densitometric data for each experiment compared with the respective static control (time, 0 min). p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. We determined whether shear stress induced changes in MT1-MMP mRNA transcription or protein expression. Shear stress decreased MT1-MMP mRNA transcription (10, 50, and 90% reduction at 1, 4, and 8 h, respectively; p < 0.05. Fig. 1 A), and this effect was associated with a diminution in MT1-MMP protein (10, 53, and 74% reduction at 1, 4, and 8 h, respectively; p< 0.05). The inhibition by shear stress was in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 1 B). The primary response transcription factor, Egr-1, was rapidly activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli. Egr-1 binds to a sequence found in the proximal promoter of the MT1-MMP gene in EC. As shown in Fig.2 A, shear stress induced the expression of Egr-1 mRNA rapidly and transiently. The densitometric data indicated that shear stress for 1 h induced Egr-1 mRNA transcription 7.6-fold greater than that of static control. Egr-1 protein was also induced by shear stress, which peaked at 4 h after exposure to shear stress and was 5.2-fold greater than that under static conditions (Fig. 2 B). Egr-1 mRNA and protein levels have been reported to be low or undetectable in quiescent EC but are dramatically increased upon exposure to shear stress (20Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 21Khachigian L.M. Collins T. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The ability of Sp1 to bind to nuclear elements is critical for basal expression of MT1-MMP in static EC. The Sp1-binding sites in the MT1-MMP promoter overlap with a number of consensus elements for the structurally related transcription factor, Egr-1 (13Haas T.L. Stitelman D. Davis S.J. Apte S.S. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22679-22685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 20Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22637-22656Google Scholar). As shown in Fig 3, Sp1 protein levels were not affected in EC exposed to shear stress. EMSA analyses, using oligonucleotides containing wild-type MT1-MMP promoter sequences (Fig.4 A), were performed to assess Egr-1 and Sp1 binding. Nuclear extracts from EC exposed to shear stress displayed a shifted complex that was more prominent compared with extracts from cells grown under no flow conditions (Fig.4 B). Bands supershifted by an anti-Sp1 antibody were also detected in shear stress-stimulated EC. These findings indicate that increased Egr-1 protein induced by shear stress cannot displace pre-bound Sp1 protein from the MT1-MMP promoter site and, therefore, cannot up-regulate MT1-MMP expression as seen in EC exposed to cyclic strain (14Yamaguchi S. Yamaguchi M. Yatsuyanagi E. Yun S.S. Nakajima N. Madri J.A. Sumpio B. Lab. Invest. 2002; 82: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To examine Sp1 protein binding further, we used mutant oligonucleotides, containing a GG to TA mutation within the Egr-1-binding site. This mutation blocks Egr-1 but not Sp1 binding (Fig. 5 A). As shown in Fig.5 B, EMSAs with nuclear extracts exposed to shear stress demonstrate that there were 3.8-, 5.8-, and 2.4-fold differences between the DNA affinity of Sp1 exposed to 1, 4, and 8 h of shear stress, respectively, compared with nuclear extracts from static cells (p < 0.05). These findings suggested that exposure of EC to shear stress increased Sp1 binding to the MT1-MMP promoter despite an increase in Egr-1 levels and no change in total Sp1 levels. Nogalamycin, an anthracycline isolated fromStreptomyces nogalator var. (23Fok J. Waring M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1972; 8: 65-74PubMed Google Scholar), prevents Egr-1 nucleoprotein complex formation and stimulates Sp1 phosphorylation (24Rafty L.A. Khachigian L.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We assessed the gel-shift profiles of nuclear extracts from EC treated with 10 μm nogalamycin for 0, 1, 4, or 8. Our results confirm that nogalamycin stimulates Sp1 binding to the MT1-MMP promoter site (Fig. 6). We assessed Sp1 protein binding to MT1-MMP in EC exposed to cyclic strain using the mutant oligonucleotide (Fig. 5 A) and anti-Sp1 polyclonal antibody. Exposure to cyclic strain decreased the Sp1 band, 53 and 77% at 1 and 4 h, respectively, compared with that of static cells (p < 0.05) (Fig.7). This suggests that cyclic strain decreases Sp1 binding to the MT1-MMP promoter with Egr-1 up-regulation and without a change of total Sp1 levels. We next investigated potential mechanism(s) underlying the change in affinity of Sp1 to DNA elicited by shear stress and nogalamycin. Regulation of Sp1-dependent transcription could be affected by changes in Sp1 abundance, DNA binding activity, and/or transactivation activity (25Black A.R. Jensen D. Lin S.Y. Azizkhan J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1207-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Interestingly, phosphorylation has been implicated in changes in Sp1 binding and transcriptional activity (26Daniel S. Zhang S. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Kim K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14692-14697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 27Rohlff C. Ahmad S. Borellini F. Lei J. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21137-21141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Although tyrosine residues are present, the vast majority of Sp1 phosphorylation in rat EC is on serine residues (25Black A.R. Jensen D. Lin S.Y. Azizkhan J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1207-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar,28Borja P.F. Collins N.K., Du, P. Azizkhan-clifford J. Mudryj M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5737-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 29Ihn H. Ihn Y. Trojanowska M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 301-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the effects of shear stress and Sp1 phosphorylation on EC. Lysates were prepared from EC exposed to shear stress, nogalamycin, and cyclic strain and immunoprecipitated with an anti-phosphoserine antibody. Total Sp1 levels remained relatively unchanged with shear stress, but phosphorylation of Sp1 was induced by shear stress in a time-dependent fashion (Fig.8 A) similar to the treatment of EC with nogalamycin (Fig. 8 B). Our previous studies showed that increasing levels of Egr-1, induced by cyclic strain, displaced the basal transcription factor Sp1 from the promoter, resulting in a significant greater rate of MT1-MMP transcription in microvascular EC (14Yamaguchi S. Yamaguchi M. Yatsuyanagi E. Yun S.S. Nakajima N. Madri J.A. Sumpio B. Lab. Invest. 2002; 82: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast to the shear stress and nogalomycin groups, however, there was no change in the phosphorylation state of Sp1 with cyclic strain exposure (Fig. 8 C). To confirm that these bands represent the phosphorylated form of Sp1, protein extracts were exposed to calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) for 30 min prior to Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig.9, the density of bands was partially diminished by CIP treatment. To demonstrate that phosphorylation of Sp1 regulates the affinity of Sp1 for the MT1-MMP promoter site, EMSAs were performed on Sp1 pretreated with or without CIP. We demonstrate a significant difference between the DNA affinity of Sp1 treated with CIP, compared with Sp1 after shear stress and nogalamycin exposure without CIP (Fig. 10). Moreover, this result demonstrates that dephosphorylation of Sp1 does not abolish the binding complex completely. These results suggest that phosphorylation of Sp1 enhances the basal level of Sp1 binding to MT1-MMP promoter and transcriptional regulation of MT1-MMP. Matrix metalloproteinases constitute a family of structurally related zinc endopeptidases capable of proteolysis of numerous components of the extracellular matrix (6Birkedal-Hansen H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 30Web Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). The wide substrate specificity suggests that MMPs play an important role in mediating diverse fundamental cellular programs that depend on stromal remodeling such as cell migration, angiogenesis, and wound healing (5Woessner J.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 6Birkedal-Hansen H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 7Mignatti P.

Whereas most MMPs are secreted, MT1-MMP, also known as MMP-14, has a single transmembrane domain and an extracellular catalytic domain that has been suggested to be a key enzyme in tumor metastasis and angiogenesis. The membrane localization makes MT1-MMP suited to function in pericellular proteolysis (33Sato H. Kinoshita T. Takino T. Nakayama K. Seiki M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar); MT1-MMP also activates MMP-2 (gelatinase A) and possibly other secreted MMPs (34Hofmann U.B. Westphal J.R. Zendman A.J.W.

J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28204-28211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP is activated during migration of EC, by culture of EC within three-dimensional collagen lattices (12Haas T.L. Davis S.J. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3604-3610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), and in cancer cells (37Kinoh H. Sato H. Tsunezuka Y. Takino T. Kawashima A. Okada Y. Seiki M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 953-959PubMed Google Scholar, 38Apte S.S. Fukai N. Beier D.R. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25511-25517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, despite the correlation between MT1-MMP levels and invasive phenotype, the mechanism of MT1-MMP activation is not clear. For example in EC, the effects of mechanical stresses, such as cyclic strain or shear stress, on MT1-MMP expression have not been well demonstrated. Previously, we reported that cyclic strain increased MT1-MMP expression in rat microvascular EC (14Yamaguchi S. Yamaguchi M. Yatsuyanagi E. Yun S.S. Nakajima N. Madri J.A. Sumpio B. Lab. Invest. 2002; 82: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, others (15Palumbo R. Gaetano C. Melillo G. Toschi E. Remuzzi A. Capogrossi M.C. Circulation. 2000; 102: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that shear stress decreases MT1-MMP expression in bovine smooth muscle cells. The enzymatic activity of MT1-MMP is regulated at several levels, including transcription, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation of MT1-MMP mRNA. Previously, we assessed the transcriptional activity of the MT1-MMP promoter region in microvessel EC using full-length and truncated promoter sequences coupled to the reporter gene encoding luciferase, and the region between −300 and −220 bp was sufficient to provide enhanced transcriptional activity (13Haas T.L. Stitelman D. Davis S.J. Apte S.S. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22679-22685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The GC-rich sequence (−288 to −275) within this region contains overlapping consensus binding sites for Sp1 and Egr-1. Sp1 and Egr-1 transcription factors compete for binding to such regions, with higher levels of transcription occurring when increasing levels of Egr-1 displace the basal transcription factor Sp1 from the promoter sequence. Thus enhanced MT1-MMP expression in EC upon cyclic strain stimulation appears to depend on binding of Egr-1 to the MT1-MMP promoter. Egr-1 mRNA and protein levels are typically low or undetectable in EC but rapidly and transiently increase when induced by any of a large number of factors (21Khachigian L.M. Collins T. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 39Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Inducible expression of Egr-1-dependent genes involves displacement of prebound Sp1 by Egr-1 from their overlapping binding sites. Once bound to DNA, Egr-1 stimulates the expression of several endothelial genes such as platelet-derived growth factor-A, platelet-derived growth factor-B, transforming growth factor-β, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and tissue factor, which are typically involved in the vascular response to injury (39Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Several previous reports have shown that shear stress induces Egr-1 activation (39Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 40Schwachtgen J.L. Houston P. Campbell C. Sukhatme V. Braddock M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2540-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, Sp1 levels are unchanged in EC exposed to shear stress (20Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Thus, Sp1 could be displaced from the proximal promoters of each of these induced genes by Egr-1 (21Khachigian L.M. Collins T. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 39Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that the expression of Egr-1 is induced by 14 dynes/cm2 shear stress in EC (Fig. 2), but shear stress inhibits MT1-MMP expression despite Egr-1 up-regulation (Fig. 1). To elucidate possible mechanisms underlying the MT1-MMP inhibition of shear stress, we have examined the binding profile of Sp1 and Egr-1 in the MT1-MMP promoter site. We detected a faint Sp1-DNA complex in the static cells and a more prominent Sp1-DNA complex in the extract from cells exposed to shear stress (Fig. 5). These observations imply that increasing levels of Egr-1 by shear stress cannot displace Sp1 from the promoter, and shear stress may increase the binding affinity of Sp1 to DNA, resulting in a significantly lower rate of transcription of MT1-MMP. Thus, the increased affinity of Sp1 to DNA by shear stress, rather than the Sp1 to Egr-1 ratio or the absolute amount of Egr-1, can result in the change of MT1-MMP expression in EC. Sp1 is a ubiquitous, 778-amino acid transcription factor that recognizes GC-rich sequences present in many promoters including the MT1-MMP promoter (25Black A.R. Jensen D. Lin S.Y. Azizkhan J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1207-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 41Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of Sp1-dependent transcription could be affected by changes in Sp1 abundance, DNA binding activity, and/or transactivation activity. Sp1 isO-glycosylated and phosphorylated, and both of these modifications are likely to be important in its regulation. Phosphorylation of Sp1 has been implicated in changes in Sp1 binding affinity and transcriptional activation, and changes inO-glycosylation alter the stability of Sp1 in vivo (42Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Although not examined here, O-glycosylation is another potential mechanism for regulation of Sp1, which has been shown to play role in the association of Sp1 with other factors and in regulation of its degradation. Recent studies (29Ihn H. Ihn Y. Trojanowska M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 301-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that serum increases Sp1 phosphorylation due to serine phosphorylation. Sp1 can be phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase CK2 (43Armstrong S.A. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13489-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), a DNA-dependent protein kinase (44Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), protein kinase A (27Rohlff C. Ahmad S. Borellini F. Lei J. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21137-21141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and by cell cycle-regulated, Sp1-associated kinase activity (25Black A.R. Jensen D. Lin S.Y. Azizkhan J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1207-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Sp1 can be phosphorylated at multiple sites by these kinases, which are likely to be important in regulation of its activity in response to diverse signals. DNA-dependent protein kinase has been reported to increase Sp1 activity, whereas phosphorylation of the C terminus of Sp1 by casein kinase II decreases its DNA binding property (43Armstrong S.A. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13489-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 44Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In order to demonstrate that shear stress is involved in the phosphorylation of Sp1, we performed immunoprecipitations with anti-tyrosine and anti-serine antibodies, and our results suggest that the vast majority of Sp1 phosphorylation induced by shear stress is on serine in rat microvascular EC (Fig. 7). Low levels of phosphorylation were detected only when the cells were incubated under static conditions, and serine phosphorylation was greatly increased when the cells were exposed to shear stress. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that Sp1 was not phosphorylated by cyclic strain (Fig. 7 C), and the level of DNA binding was decreased by displacement with increased Egr-1. These findings suggest that dephosphorylated Sp1 has a low affinity to bind DNA and can be displaced easily with increased Egr-1. This is supported by the findings that the amount of Sp1 and DNA complex in the nuclear extracts treated with CIP was lower than that of non-treated extracts. These findings are consistent with the recent studies that show that Sp1 phosphorylation induces increased levels of DNA binding that involve alterations in the association of Sp1 with other proteins such as Egr-1 (24Rafty L.A. Khachigian L.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Black A.R. Jensen D. Lin S.Y. Azizkhan J.C. J. Biol.

Sp1 is a ubiquitous transcription factor that is capable of inducible regulation by several diverse mechanisms. Changes in the level of Sp1 phosphorylation are important for displacement by Egr-1 in the common binding site of the MT1-MMP promoter. Shear stress induces Sp1 phosphorylation in EC and increases its DNA binding affinity. These findings suggest that increased levels of Egr-1 cannot displace prebound Sp1 and that MT1-MMP can be inhibited by shear stress in EC. The results of this study further support a role for Sp1, not only in the regulation of basal transcription of the MT1-MMP gene but also in the modulation of the expression of this gene in response to various hemodynamic stimuli."

In humans, various pathological states and developmental abnormalities result from inadequate or excessive levels of circulating thyroid hormones. These include mental retardation, stunted growth, hearing loss, and alterations in thermogenic homeostasis and heart rate. Therefore, the development of thyroid hormone analogs that are thyroid hormone receptor (TR) 1The abbreviations used are: TR, thyroid hormone receptor; xTR, X. laevis TR; T3, 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine; T4, thyroxine; TRE, thyroid hormone response element; MMR, Marc's modified ringers. isotype-specific agonists and antagonists may be clinically useful. In addition, such compounds would be valuable basic research tools to study the biology of thyroid hormone signaling pathways. To date, the development of potent antagonists has proven problematic. The cardiac arrhythmia drug amiodarone and its primary metabolite, desethylamiodarone, have been proposed to function in part as thyroid hormone receptor antagonists (4Norman M.F. Lavin T.N. J. Clin.

However, these compounds have relatively weak binding affinity and low potency and therefore have not yet been used successfully in an animal model. We are using Xenopus laevis metamorphosis as a simple and highly reproducible screen for biologically active thyroid hormone agonists and antagonists. The Xenopus system is a valuable model for thyroid hormone action for a number of reasons (1Tata J.R. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,10Sachs L.M.

The Xenopus thyroid hormones, thyroxine (or T4) and the most potent form, T3, are identical in structure to the mammalian thyroid hormones (see Fig. 1) (11Dodd M.H.I. Dodd J.M. Lofts B. Physiology of the Amphibia. Academic Press, New York1976: 467-599Crossref Google Scholar). The initiation and completion of metamorphosis is dependent on thyroid hormones secreted from the developing thyroid gland (11Dodd M.H.I. Dodd J.M. Lofts B. Physiology of the Amphibia. Academic Press, New York1976: 467-599Crossref Google Scholar). Peripheral target cell concentrations of T3 are regulated through the tissue-specific expression of the highly conserved type II (D2) and type III (D3) deiodinase enzymes (12Huang H. Marsh-Armstrong N. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 962-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 13St. Germain D.L. Schwartzman R.A. Croteau W. Kanamori A. Wang Z.

Furlow, unpublished results. are structurally and functionally well conserved with the mammalian counterparts. The TRs recognize thyroid hormone response elements in native target genes that contain canonical direct repeats similar to AGGTCA separated by 4 base pairs (17Furlow J.D. Brown D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2076-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Machuca I.

Tadpoles readily take up thyroid hormones from the aqueous rearing solution and respond in a dose-dependent and highly stereotypic manner. Each tissue responds directly and independently to the hormone based on organ culture experiments, whether the response is growth of adult cells or death of larval cells (11Dodd M.H.I. Dodd J.M. Lofts B. Physiology of the Amphibia. Academic Press, New York1976: 467-599Crossref Google Scholar, 20Yoshizato K. Int. Rev.

Thus, amphibian metamorphosis presents a unique opportunity to address important questions regarding thyroid hormone actions that are common to all vertebrates. We report here the characterization of a new thyroid hormone receptor antagonist, NH-3 (9Nguyen N.-H. Apriletti J.W. Cunha-Lima S. Webb P. Baxter J.D. Scanlan T.S. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), using X. laevismetamorphosis as our model system. NH-3 appears to have improved antagonistic properties over the previous compounds that may allow characterization of its activity in vivo. We present evidence that NH-3 is indeed a potent inhibitor not only of thyroid hormone action in vitro but of induced and spontaneous metamorphosis in vivo as well. The synthesis and purification of NH-3 has been described in detail previously (9Nguyen N.-H. Apriletti J.W. Cunha-Lima S. Webb P. Baxter J.D. Scanlan T.S. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Lyophilized NH-3 was reconstituted in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at a concentration of 10 mm and stored in aliquots at −20 °C until use. GC-1 was synthesized as described (22Chiellini G. Apriletti J.W. Yoshihara H. Baxter J.D. Ribeiro R.C. Scanlan T.S. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and stored as a 10 mmstock in Me2SO. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. T3 was dissolved in 4 mmNaOH at a concentration of 1 mm and stored at −80 °C. Methimazole was dissolved in sterile water at 1 m and stored at −20 °C. Human uterine cervix cancer (HeLa) cells (Cell Culture Facility, UCSF) were grown to ∼80% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/H-21, 4.5 g/liter glucose medium containing 10% newborn calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells (∼1.5 × 106) were collected and resuspended in 0.5 ml of electroporation buffer (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% dextrose, 10 mg/ml bioprene) with 5 μg of the TH/bZIP TRE-ΔMTV luciferase reporter plasmid (17Furlow J.D. Brown D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2076-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), 0.5 μg of pRL-TK constitutive Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega), and 1 μg of either the miw xTRα or themiw xTRβ expression vector per transfection. Cells were transfected by electroporation (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser; 0.32 kV, 960 microfarad, 0.4-cm cuvettes) and plated in 12-well plates in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/H-21 with 10% hormone-depleted newborn calf serum). After a 6-h incubation, ligand or vehicle (EtOH) were added in triplicate. After an additional 24-h incubation, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity using the Promega Dual Luciferase kit (Promega) and an Analytical Luminescence Laboratory Monolight® 3010 luminometer. Data were normalized to theRenilla luciferase activity and analyzed with the Graph-Pad computer program (GraphPad Software, Inc.) using single-site competition models to generate IC50 values. For mammalian two-hybrid assays, X. laevis TRα and TRβ hinge and ligand binding domain sequences were amplified by PCR and subcloned down-stream of the yeast transcription factor gal4 DNA binding domain in the pSG5 expression vector (gift from Dr. Marty Privalsky, UC Davis). 2.5 μg of an upstream activation sequence-containing luciferase reporter, 2.5 μg of a constitutive β-galactosidase expression vector, 1 μg of either TR LBD/gal4 DBD fusion vector, and 1 μg of an expression vector for GRIP-1/VP16 fusion protein (gift from Dr. John Baxter, UCSF) or SRC-1/gal4 activation domain fusion protein (gift from Dr. Marty Privalsky) were transfected by electroporation into HeLa cells and processed as described above. [35S]methionine-labeled (AmershamBiosciences) TRα and TRβ proteins were synthesized using TnT SP6 Coupled Wheat Germ Extract in vitro transcription and translation system (Promega). 2 μl of translated35S-labeled TR was mixed with the indicated concentrations of T3, GC-1, NH-3, or vehicle and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. 2 μg of type IV elastase (Sigma) was mixed with the TR and hormone in 96-well plates (Costar 9017), bringing the total volume to 20 μl. After a 20-min room temperature incubation, SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added followed by four 1-min freeze-thaw cycles. Samples were boiled for 10 min before SDS-PAGE analysis. The SDS-PAGE gel was fixed with 25% isopropanol and 10% acetic acid and dried for 2 h. The gel was exposed to a phosphorimager screen overnight and scanned with Storm 860 (Molecular Dynamics). The bands were quantitated using ImageQuant software. X. laevistadpoles of specific developmental stages were purchased from Nasco, Inc. The animals were tightly restaged upon receipt according to the Normal Table of X. laevis (23Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). 2nd Ed. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York & London1994Google Scholar). For induced metamorphosis experiments, three stage-52/53 tadpoles were added per Extra-Deep dish (Fisher) for a total of six tadpoles per group in 75 ml of 0.1× MMR (10 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm KCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm HEPES pH 7.5). T3 concentrations of 5 nm, 15 nm, and 50 nm were used in conjunction with varying concentrations of NH-3 or the same volume of vehicle only (Me2SO or 4 mm NaOH). The solutions were changed every other day for a total of 5 days. Two stage-57 tadpoles were added per Extra-Deep dish for a total of four tadpoles per group in 75 ml of 0.1× MMR. The tadpoles were bathed in 0.25–3 μm NH-3, 1 mm methimazole, or an appropriate amount of vehicle only (Me2SO). The solutions were changed every other day, and developmental stages (23Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). 2nd Ed. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York & London1994Google Scholar) were recorded until the controls went through metamorphosis completely. At this point, NH-3 was removed, and the remaining tadpoles were allowed to continue through metamorphosis in 0.1× MMR. Tadpole tails were cultured in vitro as described previously (21Tata J.R. Kawahara A. Baker B.S. Dev. Biol. 1991; 146: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Staged tadpoles were pretreated in 1× Steinberg's solution (10 mm HEPES, 60 mm NaCl, 0.67 mm KCl, 0.34 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.83 mmMgSO4, pH 7.4) containing gentamycin (70 μg/ml) and streptomycin (200 μg/ml) 24 h before removal of the tail tips for culture. The tadpoles were briefly anesthetized in water containing 0.01% MS222 (aminoesterbenzoic acid, Sigma), after which 6 mm of the tail was cut and placed in 1 ml of 1× Steinberg's solution with antibiotics and 5 μg/ml insulin in 12-well Falcon tissue culture dishes (Becton-Dickinson). Tail tips were left in the culture medium for 24 h before the first hormone treatment. Afterward, the culture medium was changed every 48 h. The length of each tail was measured every 24 h, and each experimental point consisted of the mean percent length change of six tails. Total RNA was extracted from tadpole tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Tissues were homogenized in TRIzol with a Tekmar Tissumizer and sheared with a 21-gauge needle three times. Synthesis of cDNA was performed using pd(N)6 (AmershamBiosciences), anti-RNase (Ambion, Inc.), and Superscript II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Quantitative PCR was performed using an Applied BioSystems GeneAmp 5700 sequence detection system, SYBR green PCR core reagents, and primers designed using Primer Express (Applied Biosystems). Collagenase-3 was detected using primers 5′-GAAGAAGCCAGGACCTTGGAT-3′and 5′-CAAATTGCAGAGCTCCGTTGA-3′. Samples were normalized using oligonucleotides specific to RNA encoding the X. laevisribosomal protein subunit L8, 5′-GCTGAGCTTTCTTGCCACAGT-3′ and 5′-GGTTGCATTCCGTGATCCTTA-3′. cDNA was diluted 1:400 for rpL8 and 1:20 for collagenase-3 before quantitative PCR. Conditions for PCR were as follows: 94 °C, 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C, 20 s; 58 °C, 30 s; and 72 °C, 30 s. The thyroid hormone antagonist NH-3 is a derivative of the selective thyromimetic GC-1 and contains a nitrophenyl acetylene moiety attached to the 5′-position of the thyronine core (Fig. 1). We employed a protease protection assay to determine whether NH-3 can bind directly to Xenopus TRs. This assay has the advantage of providing an estimate of the relative binding affinity and a means to detect conformational differences when TRs are bound to various ligands. Using elastase IV, increasing amounts of protected bands at ∼35 kDa were observed with increasing NH-3 concentrations (Fig.2 A). Binding of NH-3 by both xTRs is reduced from the agonists T3 and GC-1 by at least one order of magnitude. 3J. D. Furlow, M. Hsu, W. Lim, D. J. Ermio, H. Y. Yang, G. Chiellini, and T. S. Scanlan, submitted for publication. NH-3 appears to bind TRβ and TRα with a similar affinity (Fig. 2 B), implying that this modification of GC-1 decreases isotype selectivity. Both the relative binding affinity and decreased isotype selectivity are consistent with findings using human TRs (9Nguyen N.-H. Apriletti J.W. Cunha-Lima S. Webb P. Baxter J.D. Scanlan T.S. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Saturating T3, GC-1, and NH-3 concentrations used in the protease protection assay revealed a distinct protected band pattern in both xTRα and β incubated with NH-3 (Fig. 2 C). The major band in the NH-3-protected TRs corresponds to a minor band in the agonist-bound receptors. This band represents a molecule ∼1.5 kDa smaller than the major agonist-protected band. Thus, the 5′-phenylethynyl extension of NH-3 appears to induce an xTR conformation that is distinct from the agonist-bound xTRs. To determine the effects of NH-3 on T3-induced transcription, xTRα or β expression plasmids were co-transfected with a TH/bZIP TRE-luciferase reporter gene into HeLa cells. NH-3 alone does not activate xTRα or β relative to untreated controls (Fig.3 A). In competition assays, NH-3 blocks activation by 1 nm T3 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). NH-3 is ∼3–4-fold more potent at antagonizing 1 nm T3 activated xTRβ relative to xTRα (∼IC50 100 nm versus 380 nm, respectively). This correlates well with the competitive binding assay data for human TRα and β, which shows ∼3-fold selective binding to the β-isotype (9Nguyen N.-H. Apriletti J.W. Cunha-Lima S. Webb P. Baxter J.D. Scanlan T.S. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), although this selectivity was less evident with Xenopus TRs using the protease protection assays (Fig. 2 B). The molecular basis for the antagonism of T3 by NH-3 was investigated using a two-hybrid assay in HeLa cells (Fig.4 A). xTRβ ligand binding domains were fused to the yeast transcription factor gal4 DNA binding domain and co-transfected with human GRIP-1 fused to VP16 or with human SRC-1 fused to the gal4 activation domain. As shown in Fig. 4 B, 10 μm NH-3 completely abolishes T3-induced interaction with the GRIP-1 fusion proteins and SRC-1. The half-maximal IC50for competition against 20 nm T3 was 920 nmNH-3 for GRIP-1 and 870 nm for SRC-1 (Fig. 4, Cand D). xTRα showed essentially the same result, except that the inhibition curves were shifted slightly to the right as expected based on the competition curve shown in Fig. 3 B(data not shown). Because NH-3 acts as a potent antagonist in transient transfection assays, we next tested the ability of NH-3 to inhibit thyroid hormone action in an in vivo animal model. Metamorphosis in the frog X. laevis is completely dependent on T4 and T3 secreted by the thyroid gland. Importantly, T4 and T3 can precociously induce metamorphosis by addition of these compounds to the rearing water (11Dodd M.H.I. Dodd J.M. Lofts B. Physiology of the Amphibia. Academic Press, New York1976: 467-599Crossref Google Scholar). To test whether NH-3 can inhibit T3-induced metamorphosis, premetamorphic X. laevis tadpoles were treated with 5 or 15 nm T3 versus increasing concentrations of NH-3 or with NH-3 alone. As shown in Fig.5, increasing NH-3 concentrations inhibit T3-induced branchial arch (internal gill) resorption, barbel resorption, expansion of the brain, and Meckel's cartilage growth, with 2 μm NH-3 showing maximal inhibition. Of the external morphological changes, hind limb growth is the least inhibited by NH-3, which is most easily seen in ventral views (Fig.5 B). 2 and 3 μm NH-3 were less effective in inhibiting 15 nm T3-induced morphological changes, indicating that the effects of NH-3 are the result of a simple competition with T3. 3 μm NH-3 alone shows some partial agonist activity, especially in reduction of the general size of the head. All tadpoles survived five-day treatments of these concentrations T3 and NH-3, and showed typical behaviors throughout the course of the experiment. Concentrations of NH-3 greater than 5 μm are toxic to the animals. We next examined the ability of NH-3 to inhibit T3-induced tail resorption. When tail tips are cultured in vitro, T3 strongly induces shrinkage of the tail. Maximal resorption rate is induced above 30 nm in this assay. 4D. J. Ermio and J. D. Furlow, unpublished results. As shown in Fig.6, addition of 2 μm NH-3 strongly delays tail resorption induced by 50 nm T3. Some resorption is induced by 2 μm NH-3 alone, suggesting that at this concentration NH-3 may have some partial agonist activity not observed in transient transfection assays. In addition to blocking morphological changes, NH-3 also inhibits T3-induced target gene up-regulation. For example, collagenase-3 is strongly induced by T3 during metamorphosis in resorbing and remodeling tissues (24Brown D.D. Wang Z. Furlow J.D. Kanamori A. Schwartzman R.A. Remo B.F. Pinder A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1924-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 25Berry D.L. Rose C.S. Remo B.F. Brown D.D. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Berry D.L. Schwartzman R.A. Brown D.D. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). NH-3 inhibits 5 nm T3-induced collagenase-3 expression in a dose-dependent manner that closely mirrors the effects of NH-3 on morphological changes (Fig.7). With NH-3 concentrations above 2 μm, partial agonism of collagenase-3 expression is observed. Animals treated with high levels of NH-3 alone (2–3 μm) show a low level of collagenase-3 induction that is less than 10% of the 5 nm T3-induced mRNA level. We next tested the ability of NH-3 to prevent spontaneous metamorphosis induced by endogenous circulating thyroid hormones. Premetamorphic, late stage-57X. laevis tadpoles were used for these experiments. These animals have started spontaneous metamorphosis with fully formed hind limbs, but their fore limbs have not yet emerged. NH-3 delays metamorphosis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.8, A and B), with 2 μm NH-3 completely arresting the animals at stage 57. 2 μm NH-3 is at least as effective at inhibition of metamorphosis as 1 mm methimazole (a thyroid hormone synthesis inhibitor). Removal of NH-3 allows metamorphosis to proceed normally after a lag of several days; therefore, the effects of NH-3 are fully reversible and not caused by general toxicity (data not shown). NH-3 is the first thyroid hormone receptor antagonist that effectively inhibits thyroid hormone action in an in vivosystem. NH-3 was designed based on an extension hypothesis for development of nuclear receptor antagonists (7Chiellini G. Nguyen N.-H. Apriletti J.W. Baxter J.D. Scanlan T.S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2002; 10: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The hypothesis holds that one can predict where to modify a nuclear receptor ligand in order to place molecular extensions that should disrupt the folding of the carboxy-terminal helix 12 and therefore prevent co-activator recruitment. When bound to both Xenopus (Figs. 3 and 4) or human TRs (9Nguyen N.-H. Apriletti J.W. Cunha-Lima S. Webb P. Baxter J.D. Scanlan T.S. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), NH-3 competitively inhibits induction of a TRE-containing reporter gene as well as p160 co-activator protein recruitment in a dose-dependent manner. On the basis of protease protection assays performed in this study, NH-3 also clearly induces a conformational change distinct from agonist-bound TRs that may reflect the predicted misfolding of helix 12 (Fig. 2 C). The difference between the major protected bands in the agonist-versus antagonist-bound TRs (1.5 kDa) corresponds well to the predicted size of helix 12. Despite the effectiveness of NH-3 in vitro, its use in both basic research and in the clinic depends on its potency as an inhibitor of thyroid hormone effects in an intact organism. As a first step, we have exploited induced and spontaneous metamorphosis of the frogX. laevis as a convenient bioassay for NH-3. Because the interaction of NH-3 with human and Xenopus TRsin vitro is remarkably similar, metamorphosis presents an ideal bioassay to screen for compounds with thyroid hormone antagonist activity. NH-3 is remarkably effective in the inhibition of spontaneous metamorphosis as well as metamorphic changes induced by exogenously added T3. Consistent with its lower TR isotype selectivity compared with GC-1, NH-3 inhibits most observed metamorphic responses, including tissue growth as seen in the brain and Meckel's cartilage and the death of larval tissues such as the internal gills and tail. Hind limb growth is less effectively inhibited by NH-3, possibly because of its slight TRβ selectivity. NH-3 does not simply inhibit T3 uptake from the rearing medium as its mode of action because it potently blocks induction of spontaneous metamorphosis by circulating endogenous thyroid hormone levels. In this case, NH-3 is a more potent inhibitor than methimazole, a compound that prevents thyroid hormone synthesis. In addition, the effects of NH-3 are completely reversible, meaning that the antagonist is non-toxic and can be added to and removed from the animal at will. In contrast to NH-3, the previously described thyroid hormone antagonists HY-4 (6Yoshihara H.A. Apriletti J.W. Baxter J.D. Scanlan T.S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001; 11: 2821-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and GC-14 (7Chiellini G. Nguyen N.-H. Apriletti J.W. Baxter J.D. Scanlan T.S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2002; 10: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) do not inhibit induced metamorphosis or T3-induced gene expression at concentrations below 10 μm; higher concentrations of these compounds were found to be very toxic to the animals (data not shown). Thus, the improved design of NH-3 over previous compounds results in higher TR affinity and greater potency such that NH-3 can be used at effective but sublethal concentrations in vivo. NH-3 shows weak partial agonist activity in both gene expression and morphological assays at concentrations >2 μm in vivo. Collagenase-3 is induced to ∼10% of the level induced by the full agonist T3. Experiments using human TRs showed that NH-3 induces the release of the corepressor NCoR in addition to preventing co-activator binding (9Nguyen N.-H. Apriletti J.W. Cunha-Lima S. Webb P. Baxter J.D. Scanlan T.S. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The absence of partial agonist activity in transient transfection may result from the lack of proper chromatin assembly on transfected plasmids. Besides corepressor release, weak partial agonism may result from metabolism of NH-3 to a compound with weak agonist activity in the intact animal. In summary, NH-3 will be a useful tool for studying the effects of reversibly blocking TR activity in a number of different animal systems. Prior to the availability of pharmacological probes, such studies have relied on TR-knockout mice that have irreversibly deprived the animal of expression of one or both TR isotypes throughout development (27Forrest D. Vennstrom B. Thyroid. 2000; 10: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Certainly, the utility of NH-3 in mammals will depend on various pharmacokinetic parameters such as metabolic clearance, cellular uptake, and binding to serum proteins, all of which may differ in an amphibian model. Beyond anuran metamorphosis, thyroid hormone has been implicated in a wide range of important biological processes in organisms that lack an available genetic approach. These include direct and indirect development of amphibians and fish (28Callery E.M. Elinson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2014981936,"Several families of plant transcription factors contain a conserved DNA binding motif known as the homeodomain. In two of these families, named Hd-Zip and glabra2, the homeodomain is associated with a leucine zipper-like dimerization motif. A group of Hd-Zip proteins, namely Hd-ZipII, contain a set of conserved cysteines within the dimerization motif and adjacent to it. Incubation of one of these proteins, Hahb-10, in the presence of thiol-reducing agents such as dithiothreitol or reduced glutathione produced a significant increase in DNA binding. Under such conditions, the protein migrated as a monomer in non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Under oxidizing conditions, a significant proportion of the protein migrated as dimers, suggesting the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. A similar behavior was observed for the glabra2 protein HAHR1, which also contains two conserved cysteines within its dimerization domain. Site-directed mutagenesis of the cysteines to serines indicated that each of them has different roles in the activation of the proteins. Purified thioredoxin was able to direct the NADPH-dependent activation of Hahb-10 and HAHR1 in the presence of thioredoxin reductase. The results suggest that redox conditions may operate to regulate the activity of these groups of plant transcription factors within plant cells.

A similar behavior was observed for the glabra2 protein HAHR1, which also contains two conserved cysteines within its dimerization domain. Site-directed mutagenesis of the cysteines to serines indicated that each of them has different roles in the activation of the proteins. Purified thioredoxin was able to direct the NADPH-dependent activation of Hahb-10 and HAHR1 in the presence of thioredoxin reductase. The results suggest that redox conditions may operate to regulate the activity of these groups of plant transcription factors within plant cells. The homeodomain (HD) 1The abbreviations used are: HD, homeodomain; DTT, dithiothreitol; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GSSG, oxidized glutathione; GSH, reduced glutathione. is a 61-amino acid protein motif found in eukaryotic transcription factors generally involved in the regulation of developmental processes (1Gehring W.J.

Helix III (the recognition helix) fits into the major groove of DNA, making extensive contacts with specific bases and the sugar-phosphate backbone (7Kissinger C.R. Liu B. Martin-Blanco E.

Cell. 1991; 67: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Despite the resemblance in structure between the HD and the helix-turn-helix motif, a striking difference is that HDs usually bind DNA as monomers with high affinity (11Otting G. Qian Y.Q. Müller M. Affolter M. Gehring W.J. Wüthrich K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4305-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 12Affolter M. Percival-Smith A. Müller M. Leupin W. Gehring W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4093-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This fact has been explained by the presence of extended contacts along the recognition helix and the N-terminal arm of the HD. HDs are present in almost every eukaryotic organism that has been investigated. In plants, several families of HD proteins have been described (13Chan R.L. Gago G.M. Palena C.M. Gonzalez D.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). One of these families, named Hd-Zip, comprises proteins with a typical leucine zipper motif adjacent to the C-terminal end of the HD (14Ruberti I. Sessa G. Lucchetti S. Morelli G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1787-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 15Schena M. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3894-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). As expected, these proteins bind DNA as dimers (16Sessa G. Morelli G. Ruberti I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3507-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The removal of the leucine zipper or the introduction of extra amino acids between the HD and the zipper significantly reduces binding affinity, indicating that the leucine zipper is responsible for the correct positioning of the HD for efficient binding (16Sessa G. Morelli G. Ruberti I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3507-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The analysis of binding at different protein concentrations suggests that dimer formation is a prerequisite for DNA binding (17Palena C.M. Gonzalez D.H. Chan R.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Hd-Zip proteins may be involved in regulating developmental processes associated with the response of plants to environmental conditions (13Chan R.L. Gago G.M. Palena C.M. Gonzalez D.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 18Carabelli M. Sessa G. Baima S. Morelli G. Ruberti I.

A different family of plant HD proteins, named glabra2, consists of larger proteins with an N-terminal HD. These proteins also bind DNA as dimers and possess a dimerization motif that resembles a leucine zipper truncated by a loop (20Palena C.M. Chan R.L. Gonzalez D.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1352: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 21Di Cristina M. Sessa G. Dolan L. Linstead P. Baima S. Ruberti I. Morelli G. Plant J. 1996; 10: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Most members of the glabra2 family are expressed specifically in epidermal cells, and the first member to be identified (glabra2) is involved in the development of trichomes, root hairs, and the seed coat mucilage (22Lu P. Porat R. Nadeau J.A. O'Neill S.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2155-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 23Masucci J.D. Rerie W.G. Foreman D.R. Zhang M. Galway M.E. Marks M.D. Schiefelbein J.W.

The HD and dimerization motif constitute the most conserved part of the different members of each family. Sequence analysis also revealed the presence of conserved cysteine-containing motifs within variable regions (i.e. within the variable loop in glabra2 proteins and near the C terminus of the leucine zipper in Hd-ZipII proteins). Because conserved cysteines have been reported to be involved in the redox regulation of the properties of several transcription factors (27Akamatsu Y. Ohno T. Hirota K. Kagoshima H. Yodoi J.

Our results indicate that redox conditions are a key factor determining the binding of these proteins to DNA and the formation of covalent oligomeric structures. We propose that a redox-dependent mechanism may operate in vivo to modulate the activity of these transcription factors in response to metabolic and/or environmental signals. An NheI/XbaI fragment containing sequences coding for the entire HD and dimerization motif plus additional amino acids (positions 86–325) from the sunflower glabra2 protein HAHR1 (34Valle E.M. Gonzalez D.H. Gago G. Chan R.L. Gene. 1997; 196: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was excised from pHX1 (which contains this fragment in vector pUC119) with HincII and EcoRI and cloned into the SmaI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-3X as described (35Palena C.M. Gonzalez D.H. Guelman S. Chan R.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For the production of a protein with only the first half of the dimerization motif (amino acids 86–184), a KpnI deletion of this clone was used. Fragments encoding proteins with either Cys or Ser at positions 185 and 188 were obtained by PCR on native HAHR1 and oligonucleotide 5′-GGCGAATTCTTGGTGATGCTCCCTGTG-3′ in combination with either 5′-GGGCTGGCAAGCCACGTTTGGTG-3′ (for CC-HAHR1), 5′-AAGGGTACCAGTACCAAC-3′ (for SC HAHR1), or 5′-GCGGGTACCAGTACCAACAGTGGTTTC-3′ (for SS-HAHR1). For CS HAHR1, oligonucleotides 5′-GGCGAATTCTTGGTGATGCTCCCTGTG-3′ and 5′-AAGGGTACCTGTACCAAC-3′ were used with DNA from SS-HAHR1 as template. Amplified products were digested with KpnI andEcoRI and cloned into similar sites in the HAHR1-expressing plasmid. These constructs express proteins bearing the entire HD and dimerization motif (amino acids 86–234). An SpeI fragment encoding amino acids 81–231 from the sunflower Hd-ZipII protein Hahb-10 (36Gonzalez D.H. Valle E.M. Gago G.M. Chan R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), previously cloned into theXbaI site of pMAL-c2, was used as the source for expression in pGEX4T-3 using BamHI and SalI sites for excision and cloning. Fragments encoding the entire Hd-Zip domain plus the CPSCE motif (amino acids 81–208) were amplified and cloned in-frame into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX4T-3. Amplifications were performed using oligonucleotides pGEX1 (5′-GGGCTGGCAAGCCACGTTTGGTG-3′) and CC10 (5′-CCGAATTCCCGATCTGTTCACACGAC-3′ for CCCCC-Hahb-10), SC10 (5′-CCGAATTCCCGATCTGTTCACACGACGGAGACACG-3′ for CCCSC-Hahb-10), or CS10 (5′-CCGAATTCCCGATCTGTTCAGACGAC-3′ for CCCCS-Hahb-10 and CCCSS-Hahb-10) using either native or CCCSC-Hahb-10 sequences as templates. Mutants with Cys to Ser changes within the leucine zipper were constructed using complementary oligonucleotides 5′-TAAATACTCAGAGTCCACCT-3′ and 5′-AGGTGGACTCTGAGTATTTA-3′ (for SCCCC-Hahb-10) or 5′-TAATGTGTTGGAGGATCTCTTTAA-3′ and 5′-TTAAAGAGATCCTCCAACACATTA-3′ (for CSSCC-Hahb-10) together with primers pGEX1 and CC10 to amplify partially overlapping N-terminal and C-terminal Hahb-10 fragments. The resulting products were mixed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgSO4, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), incubated at 95 °C during 5 min, and annealed by allowing the solution to cool to 24 °C in ∼1 h. After this, 0.5 mmeach dNTP and 5 units of the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I were added, and incubation was followed for 1 h at 37 °C. A portion of this reaction was directly used to amplify the annealed fragments using primers pGEX1 and CC10. Mutants SCCSS-Hahb-10 and CSSSS-Hahb-10 were obtained in a similar way but using primer CS10 instead of CC10 and DNA from CCCSC-Hahb-10 as template. Mutant SSSSS-Hahb-10 was obtained by mutating CSSSS-Hahb-10. All constructions were checked by DNA sequence analysis. For expression, E. coli JM109 cells bearing the corresponding plasmids were grown and induced as described previously (35Palena C.M. Gonzalez D.H. Guelman S. Chan R.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Purification and cleavage of the fusion products were carried out essentially as described by Smith and Johnson (37Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar), with modifications described by Palena et al. (35Palena C.M. Gonzalez D.H. Guelman S. Chan R.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Purified proteins (>95% as judged by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of denaturing polyacrylamide gels) were used for the assays. Protein amounts were measured as described by Sedmak and Grossberg (38Sedmak J. Grossberg S. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar). His-tagged E. coli thioredoxin encoded in plasmid pET-32a(+) (Novagen, Inc.) was expressed from this plasmid and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. E. coli thioredoxin reductase was expressed from plasmid pTrR301 and purified as described by Mulrooney (39Mulrooney S.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Treatments with redox agents were performed in this buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Reagents were dissolved in the same buffer. For electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), aliquots of purified proteins were incubated with double-stranded DNA generated by hybridization of the complementary oligonucleotides 5′-AATTCAGATCTCAATGATTGAGAG-3′ and 5′-GATCCTCTCAATCATTGAGATCTG-3′ (for Hahb-10) or 5′-AATTCAGATCTCATTAAATGAGAG-3′ and 5′-GATCCTCTCATTTAATGAGATCTG-3′ (for HAHR1) and labeled with [α-32P]dATP by filling in the 3′-ends using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I. Binding reactions (20 μl) containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10% glycerol, 0.6 ng (30,000 cpm) of labeled oligonucleotide and 50 ng of protein were incubated for 20 min at room temperature, supplemented with 2.5% Ficoll, and immediately loaded onto a running gel (5% acrylamide, 0.08% bisacrylamide in 0.5× TBE plus 2.5% glycerol (1× TBE is 90 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), 2 mm EDTA). The gel was run in 0.5× TBE at 20 mA for 2 h and dried before autoradiography. Control experiments indicated that after 20 min of incubation, binding equilibrium was attained. For quantitative analyses of binding affinity, poly(dI-dC) was omitted, and radioactive bands were cut from exposed gels and measured by scintillation counting. Data handling and curve fitting were performed using Sigma plot software. Overall dissociation constants (K 12) of the dimer-DNA complexes into monomers and free DNA were calculated using the equation K 12 = P 2 ×D/P 2 D, according to the binding sequence 2P → P 2, andP 2 + D →P 2 D, were P,P 2, D, andP 2 D represent protein monomers and dimers and free and bound DNA, respectively (17Palena C.M. Gonzalez D.H. Chan R.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels were performed essentially as described by Laemmli (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), except that β-mercaptoethanol was omitted from the loading buffer. Samples (1 μg protein) were preincubated at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) plus the indicated additions, mixed with loading buffer, boiled during 5 min, and loaded onto a 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Sunflower nuclei and nuclear extracts were prepared from 4-day-old seedlings according to the technique described in Maliga et al. (41Manzara T. Gruissem W. Maliga P. Klessig D.F. Cashmore A.R. Gruissem W. Varner J.E. Methods in Plant Molecular Biology: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1995: 233-260Google Scholar). Protein patterns were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and total protein concentration was measured as described (38Sedmak J. Grossberg S. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar). For Western blots, aliquots of extracts (5 μg of protein) previously dialyzed in buffer without reductants were incubated under different conditions and loaded onto non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and developed using anti-HAHR1 polyclonal antibodies (35Palena C.M. Gonzalez D.H. Guelman S. Chan R.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and chemiluminescent peroxidase reagents (Amersham Biosciences) using standard protocols. We have previously demonstrated that the sunflower HD protein HAHR1 binds a pseudopalindromic 9-bp DNA sequence as a dimer (20Palena C.M. Chan R.L. Gonzalez D.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1352: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 42Tron A.E. Bertoncini C.W. Palena C.M. Chan R.L. Gonzalez D.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4866-4872Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence comparisons of HAHR1 with other proteins from the glabra2 family showed a high conservation along the HD and dimerization domain, with the sole exception of the disordered loop that separates helix I and II of the dimerization domain (Fig.1 A). This loop is characterized by the presence of Gly, Pro, and Ser but is variable in length, and defined positions are only poorly conserved, suggesting that its main role is as a flexible linker between the two helices. Within this context, it is noteworthy that a block that contains two cysteines (CXXCG) is present within the loop of all glabra2-like proteins described up to now (Fig. 1 A). This conservation is likely an indicator of an essential function of this segment and, particularly, of the conserved cysteines within it. To test the role of the oxidation state of the conserved cysteines on the properties of HAHR1, we have incubated the recombinant protein in the presence of the oxidant diamide and the sulfhydryl reductant DTT and analyzed the extent of DNA binding using EMSA (Fig.2). Incubation in the presence of DTT produced a marked increase in DNA binding with respect to samples incubated with diamide, suggesting that cysteines in the reduced state are required for efficient binding. A similar observation was made when the binding reactions were subjected to UV photocross-linking and analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gels (not shown). This indicates that the observed changes in DNA binding are not due to differential dissociation of the protein-DNA complex during electrophoresis. Similar differences in binding activity were obtained in the absence and presence of the nonspecific competitor poly(dI-dC). Determination of the overall dissociation constant of bound dimers into free monomers (K 12) yielded values of 3.10 (±0.01) × 10−14m2 and 1.88 (±0.09) × 10−13m2 for the proteins incubated in the presence of DTT or diamide, respectively, indicating that the reducing agent produces an increase in the affinity of the protein for DNA. Kinetic analysis showed that the rate of association of the complex is increased by incubation with DTT, whereas the rate of complex dissociation is not significantly affected (not shown). When both cysteines present within the dimerization motif were mutated to serine a protein active under both redox conditions was obtained (Fig. 2). To further define the requirements for the redox conversion of HAHR1, we have tested the effect of the redox pair oxidized glutathione (GSSG)/reduced glutathione (GSH). As shown in Fig.3 (left panel), a significant activation was obtained with GSH, indicating that this compound, which has a lower reduction potential than DTT, is able to reduce HAHR1 cysteines, although less efficiently than DTT. Interestingly, a sample incubated without any oxidant or reductant showed similar binding activity as those incubated with oxidants (Fig. 3, left panel), suggesting that the protein is spontaneously oxidized during dialysis or incubation without reducing agents. The individual role of each of the two cysteines present in the loop of the dimerization motif was analyzed by producing proteins with single mutations to serine. Both proteins were sensitive to oxidation although to a different extent. CS-HAHR1 was partially active under oxidizing conditions and was activated by GSH even if DTT was required for full activation (Fig. 3, right panel). SC-HAHR1, on the contrary, showed significant binding only in the presence of DTT. The different behavior of the single mutants may reflect differences in redox potential of the respective cysteines. The fact that HAHR1 forms dimers in solution suggests that the cysteines present within the loop of the dimerization motif may form intermolecular disulfide bonds when oxidized. This possibility was analyzed by performing denaturing polyacrylamide gels under non-reducing conditions of proteins subjected to different treatments. As shown in Fig.4 (upper panel), proteins with either one or both cysteines formed species with significantly reduced mobility corresponding to dimers in the absence of reducing agents. Proteins treated with DTT behaved as monomers, suggesting that they are non-covalent dimers. Incubation in the presence of oxidizing agents did not enhance the amount of species with reduced mobility, whereas GSH was as efficient as DTT as reducing agent (Fig. 4, middleand lower panel). It should be noted that there is not an exact correlation of the amount of monomers and DNA binding activity. This may be due to the different pre-treatment of samples (i.e. samples to be analyzed in SDS-polyacrylamide gels were boiled before loading to completely disrupt non-covalent interactions, whereas samples to be analyzed by mobility shift assays were incubated at room temperature). Nevertheless, the formation of interchain disulfide bonds between adjacent monomers seems to be related with the decrease in DNA binding. The native protein present in sunflower nuclei showed a similar behavior. Western blots of nuclear extracts incubated in the presence of reductants developed with anti-HAHR1 antibodies showed a distinct band of about 70 kDa, corresponding to the monomer (Fig.5, upper panel). This band was not observed when extracts were incubated under oxidizing conditions, most likely because of the formation of larger species, which barely entered the gel. In fact, reactive bands in the region corresponding to the stacking gel were evident under these conditions (not shown). The response of HAHR1 differed from that of other proteins from the nuclear extract, as judged from Coomassie Blue-stained gels (Fig. 5,lower panel). Although a major group of proteins changed their mobility only in the presence of DTT, several minor bands remained unchanged under all conditions. Analysis of conserved cysteines in other plant HD proteins revealed that in all proteins from the Hd-ZipII subclass described up to now there is a CPSCE motif adjacent to the leucine zipper (Fig. 1 B). This motif contains two conserved cysteines and resembles the CXXCG motif present in glabra2 proteins. To determine whether Hd-ZipII proteins also undergo redox-dependent changes, we have expressed the sunflower Hd-ZipII protein Hahb-10 (36Gonzalez D.H. Valle E.M. Gago G.M. Chan R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in E. coli and performed similar studies as those described above for HAHR1. Just as HAHR1, Hahb-10 binds DNA poorly under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 6, upper panel). Treatment with DTT produced a significant increase in DNA binding, indicating that the reduction of cysteines is required for its activation. GSH also produced an increase in binding although lower than that produced by DTT. Measurement of the dissociation constants under oxidizing (K 12 = 2.1 (±0.1) × 10−13m2) and reducing (K 12 = 1.3(±0.1) × 10−14m2) conditions indicated that DTT produces an increase in binding affinity. Kinetic analysis showed that both the association and dissociation rates of the complex were changed (i.e. the association rate was increased, and the dissociation rate was decreased in the presence of DTT). Mutation of both cysteines to serine significantly reduced the oxidation-dependent decrease in DNA binding (Fig. 6,upper panel). However, the mutated protein still retained partial sensitivity to oxidizing agents, which is more evident when DNA binding is analyzed at lower protein concentrations (see below). This may be caused by the presence of additional cysteines within the leucine zipper of Hahb-10. Single mutations of cysteines in the CPSCE motif of Hahb-10 produced proteins with intermediate DNA binding activity under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 6, lower panel). SC-Hahb-10 was less active that CS-Hahb-10 in the presence of oxidants and was significantly activated only in the presence of DTT. This indicates that the behavior of the single cysteine mutants within the CXXCX motif is very similar for HAHR1 and Hahb-10. Non-reducing gels indicated the presence of covalently bound species under oxidizing conditions for all the proteins under study (Fig.7). Native Hahb-10 formed species that migrated considerably slower than dimers, which in turn were predominant in cysteine mutants under oxidizing conditions. Full conversion into monomers was only attained in the presence of DTT, whereas GSH was only partially active (Fig. 7). This shows that there is a close correlation between the formation of intermolecular covalent bonds and the decrease in DNA binding. On comparing these parameters for the different proteins under oxidizing conditions, however, it becomes evident that at least part of the proteins that participate in covalent bond formation are active in DNA binding. This suggests that the formation of certain disulfide bonds influences binding activity in a different way than the formation of others. Accordingly, the role of cysteines present in the leucine zipper of Hahb-10 was also investigated. The portion of Hahb-10 used for these studies has three additional cysteines within the leucine zipper (Fig. 1 B). Two of them are present at a positions (that is, facing the dimer interface) of the second and third heptads (a 2 and a 3, respectively), whereas the other is at the g position of the second heptad (g 2), adjacent toa 3 and also near the interface according to known leucine zipper structures (43O'Shea E.K. Klemm J.D. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1991; 254: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). Cysteinesa 2 and a 3 are conserved in all Hd-ZipII proteins, whereas cysteine g 2 is present in most of them. The role of these cysteines was studied by the analysis of the properties of proteins with different combinations of mutated cysteines. The nomenclature used for the different proteins is presented in Fig. 8 A. From the analysis of the DNA binding properties of mutants (Fig. 8 B), the following observations were made. 1) Proteins in which cysteinesg 2 and a 3 are mutated to serine are largely insensitive to redox conditions in terms of binding activity (Fig. 8 B, upper panel); 2) proteins with cysteine at positions g 2 anda 3 are highly sensitive to oxidation (Fig.8 B, lower panel); 3) proteins in which cysteinea 2 is mutated to serine show a significant decrease in binding under all conditions. These results indicate that adjacent cysteines g 2 anda 3 are main determinants of the sensitivity of DNA binding to oxidation and that cysteines within the CPSCE motif also influence this behavior. Oxidation of cysteinea 2 does not influence DNA binding. The formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds was analyzed by non-reducing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As expected, all proteins, with the sole exception of the all-serine mutant, produced cross-linked species under oxidizing conditions (Fig.9). SSSCC-Hahb-10 also showed a significant proportion of monomers (lower panel), which were not observed for the other proteins. Cysteines within the leucine zipper are then probably responsible for the formation of cross-linked species. CSSSS-Hahb-10 forms dimers under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 9,middle panel), suggesting that cysteinesa 2 from two adjacent monomers form cross-linked active dimers. Conversely, covalent dimers formed by SCCSS-Hahb-10 (upper panel) seem to be inactive. This confirms that disulfide bond formation may lead to either active or inactive proteins, depending on the nature of the cysteines that are involved. The fact that the reduction of disulfide bonds promotes the activation of HAHR1 and Hahb-10 raises the possibility that a similar reaction is used under physiological conditions to regulate the properties of these transcription factors. Redox changes in protein cysteines are usually catalyzed in vivo by thioredoxin, a small protein that is in turn reduced by NADPH in the presence of thioredoxin reductase (28Arnér E.S.J. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar, 44Buchanan B.B. Schurmann P. Decottignies P. Lozano R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We have then analyzed the thioredoxin-dependent activation of HAHR1 and Hahb-10 and their respective mutants using recombinant thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase purified from E. coli. As shown in Fig.10, this system was as efficient as DTT in the activation of HAHR1 and Hahb-10. This is consistent with a role of thioredoxin in catalyzing thiol/disulfide exchanges in these transcription factors in vivo. Post-translational modifications are extensively used by cells to modulate the activity of proteins. Among these modifications, dithiol/disulfide exchanges are key components of regulatory systems that respond to changes in redox conditions (28Arnér E.S.J. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar, 44Buchanan B.B. Schurmann P. Decottignies P. Lozano R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 45Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we show that two plant HD transcription factors undergo dithiol/disulfide exchanges that produce changes in their affinity for their DNA target sequences. One of these factors, HAHR1, belongs to the glabra2 family whose members are thought to participate in epidermal cell development both at the embryo and adult plant level (22Lu P. Porat R. Nadeau J.A. O'Neill S.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2155-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 23Masucci J.D. Rerie W.G. Foreman D.R. Zhang M. Galway M.E. Marks M.D. Schiefelbein J.W.

Because the cysteines involved in redox modulation (i.e.those present in the loop of the dimerization motif) are conserved in all members of the glabra2 family, we propose that all glabra2-like plant HD proteins undergo similar changes. This also applies to Hahb-10 and Hd-ZipII proteins, which possess a set of conserved cysteines in and outside the leucine zipper motif. Although both proteins tested are activated in the presence of reductants, they show a different response to the cellular redox agent GSH than to DTT. The first of these compounds produces only a partial activation of HAHR1 and Hahb-10, probably because only part of the disulfide bonds are reduced. Full activation requires the action of more potent reductants. In vivo GSH itself participates in the reduction of proteins, sometimes with the aid of a protein called glutaredoxin (45Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A different system, with higher reducing potential, is composed by thioredoxin, a protein that is in turn reduced by NADPH in a reaction catalyzed by NADPH-thioredoxin reductase (28Arnér E.S.J. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar, 44Buchanan B.B. Schurmann P. Decottignies P. Lozano R.M. Arch. Biochem.

Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results using purified proteins in vitro indicate that this system is able to promote full activation of HAHR1 and Hahb-10. We propose, then, that the intracellular levels of GSH and reduced thioredoxin operate in concert to influence the activation state of the proteins under study. Regarding the physiological significance of our observations, it should be mentioned that redox agents are known to influence several aspects of development in plants. Root growth, root hair number, and root hair length respond to the inclusion of redox agents in the growth medium (47May M.J. Vernoux T. Leaver C.J. Van Montagu M. Inzé D. J. Exp. Bot. 1998; 49: 649-667Google Scholar, 48Sánchez-Fernández R. Fricker M. Corben L.B. White N.S. Sheard N. Leaver C.J. Van Montagu M. Inzé D. May M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2745-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and mutants in the enzyme γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, involved in the synthesis of GSH, show altered root development and reduced cell division rates (49Vernoux T. Wilson R.C. Seeley K.A. Reichheld J.-P. Muroy S. Brown S. Maughan S.C. Cobbett C.S. Van Montagu M. Inzé D. May M.J. Sung Z.R. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 97-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Root hair development establishes a link between GSH and glabra2 proteins. Mutations in glabra2produce an increase in root hair number, suggesting that the encoded protein is involved in repressing root hair formation (21Di Cristina M. Sessa G. Dolan L. Linstead P. Baima S. Ruberti I. Morelli G. Plant J. 1996; 10: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 23Masucci J.D. Rerie W.G. Foreman D.R. Zhang M. Galway M.E. Marks M.D. Schiefelbein J.W. Development. 1996; 122: 1253-1260PubMed Google Scholar). If GSH acts through activation of glabra2, then the inclusion of this redox agent should promote a decrease in root hair number. Previous studies indicate, however, that GSH has the opposite effect (48Sánchez-Fernández R. Fricker M. Corben L.B. White N.S. Sheard N. Leaver C.J. Van Montagu M. Inzé D. May M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2745-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Although these results are difficult to reconcile, it should be mentioned that a recent report indicates that the overexpression of glabra2 produces plants similar in phenotype to glabra2 mutants (50Ohashi Y. Oka A. Ruberti I. Morelli G. Aoyama T. Plant J. 2002; 29: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). An increase in glabra2 activity over a certain threshold may then produce an increase in root hair number. Considering Hd-ZipII proteins, current knowledge indicates that some of these proteins are involved in certain developmental responses of plants to illumination. The genes for two ArabidopsisHd-ZipII proteins, Athb-2 and -4, are induced by far red-rich light (18Carabelli M. Sessa G. Baima S. Morelli G. Ruberti I. Plant J. 1993; 4: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and changes in the expression levels of HAT4 or Athb-2 (which are the same protein) influence hypocotyl elongation and leaf expansion, mimicking certain effects of illumination (19Schena M. Lloyd A.M. Davis R.W. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 51Steindler C. Matteucci A. Sessa G. Weimar T. Ohgishi M. Aoyama T. Morelli G. Ruberti I. Development. 1999; 126: 4235-4245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Then, also in this case there is a link between environmental conditions and the modification of plant development. We propose that part of these modifications is brought about by environmentally induced changes in cellular redox agents that in turn modulate the activity of transcription factors of the type reported in this study. Regarding the nature of the structural modifications that render these proteins inactive under oxidation conditions, it is noteworthy that the residues that participate in this process are located outside the DNA binding motif. For Hahb-10, it can be envisaged that intermolecular cross-linking of residues within the leucine zipper may affect the correct positioning of monomers for DNA binding. In the crystal structure of the GCN4 leucine zipper, the side chains of residues at position a lie in close proximity (Fig.11). In addition, contacts between residue g from one chain and residue a from the following heptad of the other chain have been shown to occur (43O'Shea E.K. Klemm J.D. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1991; 254: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). From our results, it is evident that a 2 residues form intermolecular cross-links that do not affect DNA binding by Hahb-10. Cross-links involving g 2 anda 3, on the contrary, seem to produce inactive dimers, probably because they cause a distortion in the leucine zipper structure. Our results also suggest that cysteines located within more disordered regions of HAHR1 and Hahb-10 also influence DNA binding. Knowledge of the changes brought about by redox transitions within these regions will require detailed structural studies of these proteins. We gratefully acknowledge Drs. Scott B. Mulrooney (Michigan State University) and Charles H. Williams, Jr. (Michigan University) for the generous gift of plasmids expressing thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase."
https://openalex.org/W2031968891,"Mutated forms of p53 are often expressed in a variety of human tumors. In addition to loss of function of the p53 tumor suppressor, mutant p53s contribute to malignant process by acquisition of novel functions that enhance transformed properties of cells and resistance to anticancer therapy in vitro, and increase tumorigenecity, invasiveness and metastatic ability in vivo. Searching for genes that change expression in response to p53 gain of function mutants may give a clue to the mechanisms underlying their oncogenic effects. Recently by subtraction hybridization cloning we found that the dUTPase gene is transcriptionally upregulated in p53-null mouse fibroblasts expressing the exogenous human tumor-derived His175 p53 mutant. Here we show that conditional expression of His175 and Trp248 hot-spot p53 mutants in p53-negative mouse 10(1) fibroblasts and human SK-OV3 and H1299 tumor cells results in increase in dUTPase gene transcription, an important marker predicting the efficacy of cancer therapy with fluoropyrimidine drugs. Using tetracycline-regulated retroviral vectors for conditional expression of p53 mutants, we found that transcription of the dUTPase gene is increased within 24 h after tetracycline withdrawal, and the cells acquire higher resistance to 5-FU. Additional inactivation of the N-terminal transcription activation domain of mutant p53 (substitutions in amino-acid residues 22 and 23) results in abrogation of both induction of dUTPase transcripts and 5-FU resistance."

Insulin stimulated IRS-1-associated PI3K activity in muscle of glycerol-infused rats 2.4-fold but had no effect in lipid-infused rats. IRS-2- and phosphotyrosine-associated PI3K activity were increased 3.5- and 4.8-fold, respectively, by insulin in glycerol-infused rats but only 1.6- and 2.3-fold in lipid-infused rats. Insulin increased Akt1 activity 3.9-fold in glycerol-infused rats, and this was impaired 41% in lipid-infused rats. Insulin action on Akt2 and p70S6K were not impaired, whereas activation of protein kinase C λ/ζ activity was reduced 47%. Insulin inhibited glycogen synthase kinase 3α (GSK-3α) activity by 30% and GSK-3β activity by ∼65% and increased protein phosphatase-1 activity by 40–47% in both glycerol- and lipid-infused rats. Insulin stimulated glycogen synthase activity 2.0-fold in glycerol-infused rats but only 1.4-fold in lipid-infused rats. Thus, 1) elevation of fatty acids differentially affects insulin action on pathways distal to PI3K, impairing activation of Akt1 and protein kinase C λ/ζ and 2) insulin action on glycogen synthase can be regulated independent of effects on GSK-3 and protein phosphatase-1 activity in vivo.

Diabetes Rev. 1997; 5: 177-269Google Scholar). Defects in glucose transport result in insulin resistance, which is a major factor in the development of type 2 diabetes (2Kahn B.B.

The molecular basis for this insulin resistance remains unknown. Insulin signaling defects have been identified in insulin-resistant states, but their full impact on glucose transport and metabolism in muscle is still unclear (4Kadowaki T. J. Clin.

However, at very high insulin levels in vitro, Akt activity is diminished in muscle from lean type 2 diabetics (26Krook A. Roth R.A. Jiang X.J. Zierath J.R. Wallberg-Henriksson H.

Whether these impairments in Akt1 or Akt2 activity are sufficient to play a role in insulin-resistant states is unclear. Akt1 knockout mice do not have insulin resistance, although their growth retardation or developmental effects could mask this (28Chen W.S., Xu, P.Z. Gottlob K. Chen M.L. Sokol K. Shiyanova T.

Glucose transport is the rate-controlling step for insulin-stimulated muscle glycogen synthesis under normal conditions and in type 2 diabetes (37Cline G.W. Petersen K.F. Krssak M. Shen J.

Insulin stimulates glycogen synthase by both activating protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1) and inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) (39Lawrence J.C., Jr. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two isoforms of GSK-3 have been identified: GSK-3α and GSK-3β (40Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). GSK-3 is a serine/threonine kinase that inhibits glycogen synthase activity by phosphorylating glycogen synthase (39Lawrence J.C., Jr. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin inactivates GSK-3 in skeletal muscle of rats and humans (41Markuns J.F. Wojtaszewski J.P. Goodyear L.J. J. Biol.

Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The upstream signaling pathways necessary for insulin activation of glycogen synthase include PI3K (44Yeh J.I. Gulve E.A. Rameh L.

J. 1995; 305: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Activation of PI3K by insulin is impaired in the muscle of humans with type 2 diabetes (25Kim Y.B. Nikoulina S.E. Ciaraldi T.P. Henry R.R. Kahn B.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), and both basal and insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activity are reduced (25Kim Y.B. Nikoulina S.E. Ciaraldi T.P. Henry R.R. Kahn B.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), but the important intermediary pathways are still unknown. Plasma fatty acids are often elevated with obesity and type 2 diabetes (3Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar, 46Boden G. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and most likely contribute to the insulin resistance in these states. We previously demonstrated that fatty acid infusion decreases whole body glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis and that this is associated with a defect in insulin-stimulated PI3K activity associated with IRS-1 in muscle (47Griffin M.E. Marcucci M.J. Cline G.W. Bell K. Barucci N. Lee D. Goodyear L.J. Kraegen E.W. White M.F. Shulman G.I. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 48Dresner A. Laurent D.

Invest. 1999; 103: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). In this study we sought to determine the mechanism(s) for the fatty acid-induced impairment in insulin action by measuring key steps downstream of PI3K leading to GSK-3 inhibition in skeletal muscle. We found differential regulation of Akt isoforms and discordance between insulin action on GSK-3, PP-1, and glycogen synthase. In addition, PKCλ/ζ activation is impaired in this insulin-resistant state. All of the animal studies were conducted in accordance with the principles and procedures outlined in the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) weighing between 250 and 300 g were housed in environmentally controlled conditions with 12-h light-dark cycles and fed standard rat food. The rats were catheterized in the right jugular vein and carotid artery, and the catheters were externalized through an incision in the skin flap behind the head. After surgery, the rats recuperated until they reached preoperative weight (∼5–7 days). All of the rats were fasted 15–18 h before each infusion study. Three groups of rats were studied using a 5-h preinfusion protocol of saline, lipid (Liposyn II, Abbot Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) combined with heparin (continuous infusion 0.0975 IU/min), or glycerol (1:3 v/v) followed by a 30-min hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Heparin activates lipoprotein lipase that catalyzes the breakdown of lipoproteins to fatty acids. Lipid/heparin or glycerol infusion was continued during the 30-min insulin clamp. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps (10 milliunits/kg/min) were performed maintaining glucose concentration at 5.5 mm using a variable 20% glucose infusion (47Griffin M.E. Marcucci M.J. Cline G.W.

Humulin regular insulin (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) was infused during the clamps. The control rats were infused only with saline for 5.5 h. After clamping, the gastrocnemius muscle was rapidly removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until analysis. All of the studies were approved by the Yale Animal Use and Care Committee. 50 mg of muscle was homogenized using a polytron at half-maximum speed for 1 min on ice in 500 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mmEDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 2 mmNa3VO4) containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. For GSK-3 activity, we changed 100 mmNaF to 1 mm NaF in buffer A. Tissue lysates were solubilized by continuous stirring for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatants were stored at −80 °C until analysis. Muscle lysates (500 μg of protein) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 5 μl of a polyclonal IRS-1 antibody or IRS-2 antibody (1:100 dilution; gift from Dr. Morris White, Joslin Diabetes Center) or a monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine (1:50 dilution, Santa Cruz) coupled to protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) or protein G-Sepharose beads. The immune complex was washed, and the PI3K activity was determined as described (23Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Franke T.F. Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).

The immune pellets were washed, and the Akt activity was determined as described previously (23Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Franke T.F. Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Muscle lysates (500 μg of protein) were subjected to immunoprecipitation for 4 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of a polyclonal PKCζ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, LA) that recognizes both PKCλ and PKCζ, coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The immune pellets were washed, and the PKCλ/ζ activity was determined as described previously (33Kanoh Y. Bandyopadhyay G. Sajan M.P. Standaert M.L. Farese R.V. J. Biol.

Muscle lysates (500 μg of protein) were subjected to immunoprecipitation for 4 h at 4 °C with either GSK-3α (1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz) or GSK-3β-specific antibody (1:100 dilution; gift from Dr. Hagit Eldar-Finkelman, Tel-Aviv University, Israel), coupled to protein A-Sepharose or protein G-Sepharose beads. The immune complexes were washed twice with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm LiCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and twice with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The kinase assay was performed on the immunoprecipitates in reaction mixtures including 50 mm Tris, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μmATP (0.25 mCi/ml), and 100 μm phosphoglycogen synthase-1 peptide substrate, and incubation was carried out for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixtures were spotted on p81 phosphocellulose paper, washed with 75 mm phosphoric acid, and counted for radioactivity (49Eldar-Finkelman H. Schreyer S.A. Shinohara M.M. LeBoeuf R.C. Krebs E.G. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). 20 mg of muscle were homogenized using a polytron at half-maximum speed for 1 min on ice in 0.5 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm Hepes, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μmpepstatin, and 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5). Homogenates were used to measure glycogen synthase activity as described previously (50Wojtaszewski J.F. Higaki Y. Hirshman M.F. Michael M.D. Dufresne S.D. Kahn C.R. Goodyear L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1257-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The glycogen synthase activity was determined at a physiologic concentration of substrate (0.3 mm UDP-glucose), calculated as nanomoles of UDP-glucose incorporated into glycogen/min/milligram of total protein and expressed as the ratio of activity assayed at 0 mmglucose-6-phosphate divided by the activity at 7.2 mmglucose-6-phosphate. This is an indicator of the change in the phosphorylation state of glycogen synthase in response to insulin (51Roach R.J. Larner J. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1977; 15: 179-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). 20 mg of muscle were homogenized using a polytron at half-maximum speed for 1 min on ice in 0.5 ml of PP-1 homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% β-mecaptoethanol, 2 mg/ml glycogen, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 10 mg/ml aprotinin. Muscle homogenates (10 μg) were preincubated with PP-1 homogenization buffer containing 4.5 nm okadaic acid for 2 min at 37 °C. The reaction was initiated by adding 15 μg of 32P-labeled phosphorylasea in the presence of 3 nm okadaic acid and 5 mm caffeine. The phosphate release was determined as described previously (52Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The muscle lysates (500 μg of protein) were subjected to immunoprecipitation for 4 h at 4 °C with 1 μl of a MAPK (Erk1 and Erk2) antibody (1:500 dilution; gift from Dr. John Blenis, Harvard Medical School) coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads. The immune complexes were washed three times with Buffer A and twice with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EGTA. The kinase assay was performed on the immunoprecipitates in reaction mixtures including 20 mmTris, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μm protein kinase inhibitor, 10 mm ATP (0.25 mCi/ml), and 10 mg/ml myelin basic protein substrate, and incubation was carried out for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixtures were spotted, washed, and counted as described for GSK-3 activity. 10–100 μg of tissue lysates protein/lane were resolved by SDS-PAGE (8 and 10% gel) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the following antibodies: Akt1- or Akt2-specific polyclonal antibody (gift from T. Franke, Columbia University, or Akt1 antibody from Santa Cruz and Akt2 antibody from Upstate Biotechnology, which gave similar results to our antibodies), a polyclonal antibody of PKCλ/ζ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a monoclonal antibody for GSK-3 (Upstate Biotechnology) that recognizes both GSK-3 α and GSK-3 β, a polyclonal antibody against the p85α subunit (Upstate Biotechnology) that recognizes all isoforms of the regulatory subunit of PI3K or p110α subunit of PI3K (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a polyclonal anti-GLUT4 (gift from H. Haspel, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI), a polyclonal PP-1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), a polyclonal glycogen synthase antibody (gift from J. Lawrence, University of Virginia), or a polyclonal IRS-1 or IRS-2 antibody (gift from M. White, Joslin Diabetes Center) in 1% nonfat dry milk overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed, and the bands were visualized as described previously (23Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Franke T.F. Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using the Stat View program (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). Statistical significance was tested with the unpaired Student’s ttest. After 30 min of insulin stimulation, IRS-1-associated PI3K activity in skeletal muscle of glycerol-infused rats was stimulated 2.4-fold above basal levels in saline-infused rats (Fig. 1A). In contrast, in lipid-infused rats, IRS-1-associated PI3K activity did not respond to insulin and was similar to that in saline control rats. Insulin also stimulated IRS-2-associated PI3K activity 3.5-fold in muscle of glycerol-infused rats but only 1.6-fold in lipid-infused rats (Fig.1B). Because of the possibility that PI3K activity associated with other phosphoproteins could contribute to the effect of insulin on glucose uptake, we also measured antiphosphotyrosine-associated PI3K (Fig. 1C). Insulin increased antiphosphotyrosine-associated PI3K activity 4.8-fold in glycerol-infused rats but only 2.3-fold in lipid-infused rats. Insulin-resistant states are associated with differential effects on Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 isoforms (23Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Franke T.F. Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that insulin stimulated Akt1 activity in skeletal muscle 3.9-fold in glycerol-infused rats and 2.3-fold in lipid-infused rats compared with saline-infused control rats. The insulin-stimulated increment in Akt1 activity above the saline value is reduced 55% in lipid-infused rats compared with glycerol-infused rats (p < 0.05) (Fig.2A). Insulin also increased Akt2 activity 1.8-fold in glycerol-infused rat and 2.3-fold in lipid-infused rats compared with control rats (Fig. 2B). However, Akt3 activity did not respond to insulin in either group (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that fatty acid infusion selectively impaired Akt1 isoform activity in skeletal muscle. Fig. 2D shows that the protein levels of Akt1 and Akt2 in skeletal muscle were not different among saline-infused, glycerol-infused, and lipid-infused rats. To determine whether impaired activation of atypical PKC plays a role in fatty acid-induced insulin resistance in rats, we measured the activity and protein levels of PKCλ/ζ in muscle. Fig3 shows that insulin stimulated PKCλ/ζ activity in skeletal muscle 2.0-fold in glycerol-infused rats and 1.35-fold in lipid-infused rats compared with saline-infused rats (Fig. 3A). The increment in insulin-stimulated PKCλ/ζ activity over saline was reduced 65% in lipid-infused rats compared with glycerol-infused rats (p < 0.05). Fig.3B shows that the protein levels of PKCλ/ζ in skeletal muscle were not different among saline-infused, glycerol-infused, or lipid-infused rats. To determine whether the insulin resistance induced by lipid infusion involves an impairment in the effect of insulin in inhibiting GSK-3 activity, we measured the activity of the two known GSK-3 isoforms, α and β. GSK-3α activity in skeletal muscle was reduced 30% in response to insulin in glycerol- and lipid-infused rats (p < 0.05) compared with saline-infused rats (Fig.4A). In contrast, insulin inhibited GSK-3β activity 63% in muscle of glycerol-infused rats (p < 0.01 versus saline) and 68% in lipid-infused rats (p < 0.001) compared with non-insulin-infused control rats (Fig. 4B). The magnitude of decrease in GSK-3β activity was greater than the decrease in GSK-3α activity, suggesting greater susceptibility of GSK-3β to insulin regulation in rat skeletal muscle. Fig. 4C shows the protein levels of GSK-3α and GSK-3β in skeletal muscle from the three study groups. We detected a 51-kDa band for GSK-3α and a 46-kDa band for GSK-3β using an antibody that recognizes both isoforms. The total amounts of GSK-3α and GSK-3β protein were unchanged by lipid infusion (Fig. 4C). To determine the effects of lipid infusion on glycogen synthase activity in rats"

In cells growing in glucose, Msn2 is located mainly in the cytosol, whereas in carbon source-starved cells, Msn2 is located largely inside the nucleus. However, in cells lacking Reg1 (the regulatory subunit of the Reg1/Glc7 protein phosphatase complex), the regulation of subcellular distribution is absent, Msn2 being constitutively present in the cytosol. The localization defect in these mutants is specific for carbon starvation stress, and it is because of the presence of an abnormally active Snf1 protein kinase that inhibits the nuclear localization of Msn2 upon carbon starvation. Active Snf1 kinase is also able to avoid the effects of rapamycin, a drug that by inhibiting the TOR kinase pathway leads to a nuclear localization of Msn2 in wild type cells. Therefore, active Snf1 and the TOR kinase pathway may affect similar cytosolic steps in the regulation of the subcellular localization of Msn2.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae regulates metabolism, gene expression, and growth in response to carbon source availability. In the presence of glucose, the expression of a large number of genes, including those involved in the utilization of alternative carbon sources, gluconeogenesis, and respiration, is repressed at the level of transcription by a process known as glucose repression (see Refs. 1Carlson M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 2Gancedo J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 334-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Johnston M.

Sci. 2001; 26: 310-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar for review). Biochemical and genetic studies have identified several crucial players in this pathway. Snf1 (Cat1) is a serine-threonine protein kinase that regulates transcription by inhibiting transcriptional repressors (e.g. Mig1) or by stimulating transcriptional activators (e.g. Cat8 and Sip4). The Snf1 protein kinase is found in complexes containing the activating subunit Snf4 (Cat3) and members of the Sip1/Sip2/Gal83 family (5Jiang R. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2099-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and its activity is regulated negatively by glucose (6Jiang R. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The Reg1·Glc7 protein phosphatase complex is involved in the regulation of the activity of the Snf1 kinase complex. GLC7(CID1) is an essential gene that encodes the catalytic subunit of the yeast protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1) (7Tu J. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6789-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is involved in glucose repression and also in the regulation of different processes including glycogen metabolism, translation initiation, sporulation, chromosome segregation, and cell cycle progression (7Tu J. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6789-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 8Cannon J. Pringle J.R. Fiechter A. Khalil M.

Cannon J.F. Dever T.E. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5700-5710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glc7 participates in the regulation of these processes by binding to specific regulatory subunits that target the phosphatase to the corresponding substrates (13Frederick D.L. Tatchell K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2922-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14MacKelvie S.H. Andrews P.D. Stark M.J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Tu J.

Reg1 (Hex2) is one of these regulatory subunits and targets Glc7 to substrates involved in the glucose repression pathway and other processes (15Tu J. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 17Alms G.R. Sanz P. Carlson M. Haystead T.A.

Chun K.T. Goebl M.G. Roach P.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 119-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response to a glucose signal, Glc7 (targeted by Reg1) dephosphorylates Snf1 kinase and inactivates the complex (20Ludin K. Jiang R. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6245-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 21Sanz P. Alms G.R. Haystead T.A.J. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In the absence of Reg1, Glc7 cannot perform its function, so the Snf1 kinase complex is constitutively active, even in the presence of glucose (20Ludin K. Jiang R. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6245-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 21Sanz P. Alms G.R. Haystead T.A.J. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Another crucial component of the glucose repression pathway is hexokinase PII (Hxk2). This protein also participates in the regulation of the Snf1 kinase complex by regulating the phosphorylation status of Reg1 (21Sanz P. Alms G.R. Haystead T.A.J. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Another process that controls growth and metabolism in response to nutrient availability is the TOR kinase pathway (22Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 23Cardenas M.E. Cutler N.S. Lorenz M.C. DiComo C.J. Heitman J.

Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). The key players in this pathway are the TOR protein kinases, Tor1 and Tor2, members of the phosphatidylinositol-related kinase family. Activation of this pathway leads to several physiological events including activation of protein translation. This pathway is inhibited by nitrogen starvation and by the drug rapamycin, a macrolide antibiotic with antiproliferative and immunosuppressive effects. Recently, it has been proposed that the TOR pathway also regulates the transcriptional response related to changes in both nitrogen and carbon source availability. As an example of the latter case, the TOR pathway affects the subcellular localization of Msn2, a transcriptional activator of genes regulated by stress (STRE-regulated genes), by regulating its interaction with Bmh2, a yeast member of the 14-3-3 protein family, which acts as a cytosolic anchor (22Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). In cells growing in glucose, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A phosphorylates nuclear Msn2 and allows its transport out of the nucleus (26Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 27Smith A. Ward M.P. Garrett S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3556-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Once in the cytosol, phosphorylated Msn2 binds to Bmh2 and forms a stable complex (22Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). In this study we describe a convergence of the TOR and the Snf1 kinase pathways in the regulation of the subcellular localization of Msn2, ensuring a proper adaptation to carbon source availability. S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in TableI. To construct strainsreg1Δ snf1Δ and reg1Δ gal83Δ, aBamHI fragment of pUC-snf1Δ::KanMX4 (see below) and a XhoI/SpeI fragment from plasmid pOV1 (28Vincent O. Townley R. Kuchin S. Carlson M.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) was used in all the subcellular localization experiments except in strains of the Σ1278b background. In this case (wild type and double bmh1bmh2Δmutant), a GFP tag was integrated at the 3′ end of the chromosomalMSN2 gene. This was carried out in several steps. First, anXbaI/HindIII fragment from plasmid pMSN2-GFP, containing most of the MSN2-GFP coding region was subcloned into pRS306 (31Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid was digested with EcoRI, which released around 500 bp from the central part of theMSN2 coding region. Flanking regions were then used to direct the integration of the linear plasmid into the chromosomalMSN2 locus by gene disruption (29Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar). In this way, we placed the expression of the MSN2-GFP fusion under the control of the original MSN2 promoter. Integrative transformants were confirmed by PCR analysis. To construct YEpACT-HA-Glc7, a fragment from pHA-Glc7 (15Tu J. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) was introduced in YEpACT vector (32Randez-Gil F. Prieto J.A. Murcia A. Sanz P. J. Cereal Sci. 1995; 21: 185-193Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), a YEplac195 (33Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar) derivative containing the promoter of the ACT1 gene (from −540 to −46, with respect to (+1)ATG). To construct the SNF1 disruption cassette containingKanMX4 as a selection marker, we first subcloned anEcoRI/SalI fragment from plasmid pRJ55 (LexA-Snf1; see Ref. 6Jiang R. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) in pUC18 to give pUC-Snf1. This plasmid was then digested with NcoI, blunt-ended with Klenow DNA polymerase, and digested with BglII. TheBglII/EcoRV fragment from pFA6a-KanMX4 was then introduced in the latter (34Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar), generating plasmid pUC-snf1Δ::KanMX4, where an inner fragment of 537 bp of theSNF1 gene was replaced by the KanMX4 selection marker. Logarithmic cultures were used to visualize GFP fusions. Aliquots (2 μl) of the cultures were put on microscope slides and covered with 18 × 18-mm coverslips. Cells were then viewed using a Zeiss Axioskop II fluorescence microscope. Images were scanned with a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc.) and processed through Adobe PhotoShop 5.0 software. Invertase activity was assayed in whole cells as described previously (6Jiang R. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (35Amoros M. Estruch F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1523-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cells corresponding to 1A 600 unit were collected by rapid centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 1 min), resuspended in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), and boiled for 3 min. Glass beads (0.3 g, 450-μm-diameter) were added to the suspension and then cells were vortexed at full speed for 30 s. The suspension was boiled again for 3 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1 min. 10 μl of the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using 7% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Msn2 antiserum (26Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence with ECL or ECL Plus reagents (AmershamBiosciences). As described in the Introduction, the subcellular localization of Msn2, a transcriptional activator of STRE-regulated genes, is modulated by carbon source availability. In cells growing in glucose, Msn2 is localized mainly in the cytosol, whereas after carbon starvation, it is located inside the nucleus (22Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar,26Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 27Smith A. Ward M.P. Garrett S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3556-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Because the Snf1 protein kinase pathway is one of the main regulators of glucose signaling, we decided to determine whether components involved in the Snf1 pathway were also involved in the regulation of the subcellular localization of Msn2 in response to glucose. To this end, we used an in frame fusion of Msn2 to the green fluorescent protein (plasmid pMSN2-GFP) (26Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). This construct contains the MSN2-GFP gene fusion under the control of theADH1 promoter in a low copy centromeric plasmid and complements the stress response defects of msn2msn4Δmutants, indicating that it is fully functional (26Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, in the wild type strain, Msn2-GFP was transported into the nucleus upon carbon starvation, as described previously (26Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). However, in the reg1Δ glucose repression mutant (lacking the regulatory subunit of the Reg1·Glc7 protein phosphatase complex), Msn2-GFP remained mainly in the cytosol after the shift. We also assayed the localization of Msn2-GFP in other mutants involved in glucose repression like snf1Δ (Fig. 1) orgal83Δ (Table II) and observed a localization pattern similar to wild type. However, a doublehxk1hxk2Δ glucose repression mutant showed the same abnormal localization pattern of Msn2-GFP after carbon starvation as the reg1Δ mutant (Fig. 1), although it was less severe. Because the Snf1 protein kinase complex is abnormally active in bothreg1Δ and hxk1hxk2Δ mutants in glucose growing cells (6Jiang R. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 21Sanz P. Alms G.R. Haystead T.A.J. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), we tested the localization pattern of Msn2-GFP in double reg1Δ snf1Δ and triple hxk1hxk2Δ snf1Δ mutants. As observed in Fig. 1, Msn2-GFP became nuclear after carbon starvation in both cases, showing similar kinetics to wild type. These results indicated that the abnormal localization of Msn2-GFP observed in reg1Δ and hxk1hxk2Δmutants was mainly because of the action of the activated Snf1 protein kinase.Table IISubcellular localization of Msn2-GFPStrain4% glucose0% glucosegal83ΔCytosolicNuclearreg2ΔCytosolicNuclearreg1Δ reg2ΔCytosolicCytosolicreg1Δ reg2Δ snf1ΔCytosolicNuclearDifferent strains expressing Msn2-GFP (from plasmid pMSN2-GFP (26Görner W.

Open table in a new tab Different strains expressing Msn2-GFP (from plasmid pMSN2-GFP (26Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar)) were analyzed as in Fig. 1. It has recently been described that Gal83 is the most abundant β-subunit of the Snf1 kinase complex in glucose growing cells and that it is responsible for the cytosolic location of the complex in these conditions (28Vincent O. Townley R. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1104-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In addition, Gal83 mediates the interaction of Snf1 with different substrates (37Vincent O. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6672-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We reasoned that in the absence of Gal83, Snf1 (although catalytically active) would be unable to perform its function. Therefore, we checked the localization of Msn2-GFP in a double reg1Δ gal83Δ mutant and observed a similar nuclear localization of the protein upon carbon starvation as compared with reg1Δ snf1Δ mutant or wild type (Fig. 1). These results confirmed that the abnormal localization of Msn2-GFP was because of the action of an activated Snf1 protein kinase that required Gal83 to perform its function. Because it has been described that Reg2 (another Glc7 regulatory subunit; see Ref. 13Frederick D.L. Tatchell K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2922-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) functions with Reg1 and Snf1 protein kinase to regulate growth, we checked the localization pattern of Msn2-GFP inreg2Δ mutants and found that it was similar to wild type (Table II). Double reg1Δ reg2Δ and triple reg1Δ reg2Δ snf1Δ mutants showed the same phenotype asreg1Δ and reg1Δ snf1Δ mutants, respectively (Table II). Therefore, Reg2 was not involved in the regulation of the localization of Msn2. The abnormal localization of Msn2-GFP in reg1Δ mutants was also suppressed by overexpressing Glc7 (Fig. 1). However, this overexpression also alleviated the glucose repression defect observed in the reg1Δ mutant (30 units of invertase in the overexpressing transformants vs. 97 units in thereg1Δ mutant, in cells growing in 4% glucose (wild type cells showed less than 1 unit of invertase under these conditions)). So, the increase in the Glc7 dosage could either be directly responsible for the suppression of the abnormal phenotype, or it could act indirectly by partially inactivating the Snf1 protein kinase. In addition to nutrient stress, Msn2 is able to respond to other forms of stress (osmotic, heat shock, etc.) (38Estruch F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 469-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the abnormal localization pattern of Msn2-GFP observed in reg1Δ and hxk1hxk2Δmutants was specific for carbon starvation conditions, we subjected these cells to osmotic stress (0.4 M NaCl) and checked the localization of the fusion protein. After 10 min of the treatment, Msn2-GFP was localized mainly in the nucleus in all the strains, including the wild type (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained when the cells were heat-shocked at 42 °C for 10 min (data not shown). Therefore, the phenotype observed in reg1Δmutant was specific for carbon starvation stress. The alteration in the intracellular localization pattern of Msn2 inreg1Δ mutants was confirmed by transcriptional analysis of target genes. As shown in Fig. 3,reg1Δ cells failed to activate the expression of theCTT1 and HSP26 genes (STRE-regulated genes whose expression in response to carbon starvation is dependent on Msn2 and Msn4; see Ref. 38Estruch F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 469-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the same mutant was able to activate the expression of the same genes in response to osmotic stress (0.4 M NaCl), confirming that the observed activation defect was specific for carbon starvation conditions. In the double reg1Δ snf1Δmutant, the activation of CTT1 and HSP26 upon carbon starvation was kinetically similar to snf1Δ or wild type (Fig. 3), confirming that the activation defect was because of an activated Snf1 kinase. In the case of the double hxk1hxk2Δmutant, it failed to activate the CTT1 gene upon carbon starvation, but it could activate the expression of HSP26(Fig. 3). This would be in agreement with our observation that this mutant showed a less severe phenotype than reg1Δ mutant (see above). However, the same mutant was able to activate bothCTT1 and HSP26 upon osmotic stress (Fig. 3). In the triple hxk1hxk2Δ snf1Δ mutant we observed an activation of CTT1 and an improvement in the activation ofHSP26 upon carbon starvation. Fig. 3 also shows that the activation of the reporter genes was always improved in any of thesnf1Δ derivatives (snf1Δ, reg1Δ snf1Δ, and hxk1hxk2Δ snf1Δ), indicating that in the absence of Snf1, Msn2 enhanced its activating properties. So, there was an indirect correlation between the activity of Snf1 and the activity of Msn2 as a transcriptional activator. It has been described recently that rapamycin, a drug that inhibits the TOR kinase pathway, causes the nuclear localization of Msn2 in wild type cells growing in glucose (see Ref. 22Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). To know whether this nuclear localization was also altered in reg1Δ mutants, we treated these cells with the drug. As shown in Fig. 1, reg1Δ cells treated with rapamycin still localized Msn2-GFP in the cytosol, whereas the doublereg1Δ snf1Δ mutant imported the fusion into the nucleus. Similar results were obtained after rapamycin treatment of doublehxk1hxk2Δ and triple hxk1hxk2Δ snf1Δmutants, respectively (Fig. 1). Therefore, active Snf1 may counteract the effects of the inhibition of the TOR kinase pathway, suggesting that it may affect similar cytosolic steps in the regulation of the subcellular localization of Msn2. To study how the presence of an active Snf1 altered the localization of Msn2-GFP inreg1Δ mutants upon carbon starvation, we analyzed Msn2 to see whether any differential post-translational modification had occurred under these conditions. We found that wild type,reg1Δ, hxk1hxk2Δ, and snf1Δmutants showed a similar pattern of post-translational modifications of the Msn2-GFP protein (Fig.4 A). Upon carbon starvation, Msn2-GFP was hyperphosphorylated in all the strains, in agreement with previous results (39Garreau H. Hasan R.N. Renault G. Estruch F. Boy-Marcotte E. Jacquet M. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2113-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). If a pulse of glucose was then added to the cells, a decrease in the phosphorylation status of the protein was also observed in all the cases. As described above, Msn2-GFP remained mainly in the cytosol in the reg1Δ mutants (see above), suggesting that the hyperphosphorylation occurred before the protein was transported to the nucleus. Similar hyperphosphorylated forms were observed when reg1Δ cells were treated with rapamycin or were subjected to either osmotic stress (0.4 M NaCl) or heat shock (42 °C for 10 min) (data not shown). Another possibility to explain the abnormal localization of Msn2-GFP inreg1Δ mutants could be that active Snf1 modified Bmh2, the cytosolic anchor of Msn2 (22Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). To test this possibility we analyzed the electrophoretic mobility of a hemagglutinin epitope-tagged version of Bmh2 in wild type, reg1Δ, andsnf1Δ mutants, but no change in the electrophoretic mobility of hemagglutinin-Bmh2 was observed in either cells growing in glucose or shifted to carbon starvation conditions for 15 min, in any strain (data not shown). When cells are growing in glucose, Msn2 is located in the cytosol where it binds to its anchoring protein Bmh2 (22Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). We wanted to test the importance of the anchoring protein in the regulation of the subcellular localization of Msn2. As Bmh2 has a very close homologue (Bmh1) that is functionally redundant, we analyzed the localization pattern of Msn2-GFP in a double bmh1bmh2Δ mutant. It is known that a double bmh1bmh2Δ mutation is lethal in most yeast genetic backgrounds, but it is still viable in the Σ1278b background (40Roberts R.L. Mösch H.U. Fink G.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 1055-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We tried to transform the Σ1278bbmh1bmh2Δ double mutant with the pMSN2-GFP construct, but we were unable to recover any viable transformant, suggesting that perhaps the overexpression of Msn2 was lethal in this double mutant. So, we integrated a GFP tag at the 3′ end of the chromosomalMSN2 gene to allow the expression of the gene fusion under the control of the original MSN2 promoter (see “Experimental Procedures”). Although the expression of the fusion protein was much lower than in the other cases, we observed that the double mutant localized Msn2-GFP inside the nucleus upon carbon starvation (Fig. 5 A). This nuclear localization of Msn2-GFP correlated with an increase in the expression of CTT1, an STRE-regulated gene (Fig.5 B). However, the kinetics of CTT1 induction were slower than in the corresponding wild type, suggesting a positive role of Bmh1 and Bmh2 in the regulation of the subcellular localization of Msn2. These results suggest that the anchoring proteins play only a minor role on the regulation of the subcellular localization of Msn2. We also analyzed the phosphorylation status of Msn2 in the doublebmh1bmh2Δ mutant. Because the transformation of the Σ1278b bmh1bmh2Δ double mutant with the pMSN2-GFP construct was not possible (see above), we studied the phosphorylation status of endogenous Msn2. As observed in Fig. 4 B, in wild type cells endogenous Msn2 underwent a hyperphosphorylation in glucose starvation conditions that was reversible upon glucose readdition to the culture. However, in bmh1bmh2Δ mutants the hyperphosphorylation of Msn2 was absent, indicating that the presence of Bmh2 was completely necessary for this modification. As Msn2-GFP was localized inside the nucleus upon carbon starvation of thebmh1bmh2Δ mutants (see above), this may indicate that Msn2 hyperphosphorylation was dispensable for its import to the nucleus. Stress factors influence cellular metabolism, gene expression, and growth rate by a “general stress response” system that regulates the coordinated induction of many stress genes through a common cis element in their promoter, the stress response element STRE (38Estruch F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 469-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This element is regulated by two functionally redundant trans-activating factors named Msn2 and Msn4. The activity of these transcription factors is modulated by two non-exclusive mechanisms: 1) regulated nuclear localization, and 2) regulated DNA binding, controlled inside the nucleus (38Estruch F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 469-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Msn2 and Msn4 are able to respond to different kinds of stress conditions (osmotic, heat shock, carbon starvation, etc.), and although all of these stresses result in the activation of STRE-regulated genes, it seems that each kind of stress is able to trigger the activation of Msn2 and Msn4 in a different manner (38Estruch F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 469-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The components that are involved in the activation of Msn2 by salt or heat shock stress are still defined poorly; only recently was it reported that PP2A phosphatases may be involved in the activation of Msn2 by salt stress (41Görner W. Slanoutz K. Ruis H. Yeast. 2001; 18: S178Google Scholar). More is known about the components involved in the activation of Msn2 by carbon starvation. In this case, two regulatory pathways have been implicated in the regulation of the subcellular localization of Msn2. The first is the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A pathway. An inverse correlation has been found between cAMP-dependent protein kinase A activity and nuclear localization of Msn2. In fact, mutations of the potential cAMP-dependent protein kinase A modification sites of Msn2 lead to constitutive nuclear localization of the protein (26Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Msn2 contains a typical nuclear localization signal and also a functional nuclear export signal (26Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), and it has been shown recently that the Msn2 nuclear localization signal is inhibited by phosphorylation driven by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and activated by dephosphorylation by a still unknown phosphatase. The Msn2 nuclear localization signal phosphorylation status is highly sensitive to carbohydrate fluctuations during fermentative growth. After glucose withdrawal, dephosphorylation occurs in less than 5 min, and the effect is reversed rapidly by refeeding with glucose (42Görner W. Durchschlag E. Wolf J. Brown E.L. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Schuller C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Recent results also indicate that Sit4 (a PP2A-related phosphatase) or its regulatory subunit Tap42 is not involved in the regulation of the localization of Msn2 (22Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). The second regulatory pathway is the one defined by the TOR protein kinases. It has been described recently that rapamycin, a drug that inhibits the TOR kinase pathway, induces the nuclear accumulation of Msn2 by releasing the binding of Msn2 to its cytosolic protein anchor Bmh2, a yeast 14-3-3 protein family homologue (22Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). We have tested the participation of Bmh2 on the nuclear localization of Msn2. In a doublebmh1bmh2Δ mutant, Msn2-GFP could still be localized inside the nucleus upon carbon starvation, indicating a minor role of the anchoring proteins in the regulation of the subcellular localization of Msn2. In this study we present strong evidence that the Snf1 protein kinase glucose repression pathway participates actively in the regulation of the subcellular localization of Msn2 in response to glucose. An active Snf1 protein kinase was able to affect the regulation of the localization of Msn2 and made it insensitive to carbon starvation. As a result, activation of STRE-regulated genes was prevented. We also present evidence that the action of Snf1 in this process was mediated via Gal83 (an Snf1 complex β-subunit), because active Snf1 was not able to perform its inhibitory function in the absence of Gal83. The absence of nuclear localization of Msn2-GFP and activation of STRE-regulated genes observed in strains having an activated Snf1 kinase was specific for carbon starvation stress. Other stress conditions such as osmotic or heat shock stresses were able to localize Msn2-GFP in the nucleus and activate the STRE-regulated genes. These results support the hypothesis that cells may contain alternative mechanisms to cope with different stress conditions. We also present evidence that active Snf1 is able to counteract the effects of rapamycin on the subcellular localization of Msn2. These results may indicate that TOR and Snf1 protein kinases would inactivate similar steps in the regulation of Msn2, probably by inactivating the same or related components in the pathway. Because the action of Snf1 is located in the cytosol, this describes alternative functions of the kinase different from its role in nuclear transcriptional control. Does Snf1 play a physiological role in wild type cells in terms of Msn2 regulation? In wild type cells growing in glucose, conditions in which the Snf1 complex is inactive, TOR kinases are active and would inhibit the nuclear import of Msn2 as a “nutrient sensing response.” Upon a shift to poor carbon source medium or carbon starvation, TOR kinases would become inactivated, resulting in an activation of the nuclear import of Msn2, probably by dephosphorylation of Msn2, which would release it from binding to its cytosolic anchor, Bmh2. At the same time, Snf1 would become active, inhibiting the nuclear import of Msn2 (“reset response”). In this way the cell would be prepared for the arrival of phosphorylated Msn2 (driven by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A) that would be produced when glucose was sensed again. In the presence of glucose, Snf1 would be inactivated and the TOR kinases activated, maintaining Msn2 in the cytosolic compartment. Therefore there would be a clear convergence of the TOR and the Snf1 kinase pathways in the regulation of the response to carbon source availability. This hypothesis is in agreement with our observation that in mutants lacking Snf1 more activation of the STRE-regulated genes was detected, probably because more Msn2 could be imported to the nucleus, as it could have more time to be activated. What is the component inactivated by Snf1 and TOR kinases? We cannot tell at present which components might be inactivated by Snf1 and TOR kinases, although Msn2 is an attractive candidate. Analysis of the phosphorylation status of Msn2 is very complicated, because it has been demonstrated that this protein suffers hyperphosphorylation upon different stress conditions (39Garreau H. Hasan R.N. Renault G. Estruch F. Boy-Marcotte E. Jacquet M. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2113-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We checked the phosphorylation status of Msn2 in different mutants and found no apparent differences. In all the strains Msn2 was hyperphosphorylated upon carbon starvation. However, this result may not reflect the actual post-translational modification of Msn2 in each case, because in terms of electrophoretic mobility this hyperphosphorylation could mask the dephosphorylation of some of the phosphates added by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, and perhaps the removal of these phosphates would be necessary to allow the interaction of the protein with specific importins to be transported into the nucleus (39Garreau H. Hasan R.N. Renault G. Estruch F. Boy-Marcotte E. Jacquet M. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2113-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The convergence of the TOR and the Snf1 kinase pathways in the subcellular localization of Msn2 is a good example of the cross-talk that exits between different pathways regulated by the same effector, glucose in this case. Very recently it has been described that both pathways also converge into the regulation of Gln3, a GATA-type transcription factor involved in the activation of nitrogen catabolite-repressible genes (43Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Chan T.F., Ai, W. Zheng X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1246-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because both the TOR and the Snf1 kinase pathways are conserved from yeast to mammalian cells (44Cutler N.S. Heitman J. Cardenas M.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 155: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 45Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar), one could speculate that AMPK (AMP-activated proteinkinase; the mammalian homologue of Snf1 kinase) could also participate in the regulation of the subcellular localization of transcriptional factors related to carbon or nitrogen starvation stress in mammalian cells. We are very grateful to Dr. Marian Carlson for strains, plasmids, and critical reading of the manuscript. We thank Dr. F. Winston and Dr. G. Fink for strains."

Vitam. Horm. 1994; 49: 433-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Through secretions into the male ejaculate, it is thought that the prostate protects the lower urinary tract from infection and increases fertility. Despite the unknown specific function, the prostate is the most common site of neoplastic transformation in men. Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer mortality in men other than skin cancer (2Greenlee R.T. Hill-Harmon M.B. Murray T. Thun M. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 2001; 51: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar). In the initial stages, prostate cancer is dependent on androgens for growth, which is the basis for androgen ablation therapy (3Huggins C. Steven R.E. Hodges C.V. Arch. Surg. 1941; 43: 209-223Crossref Google Scholar). However, in most cases, prostate cancer progresses to an androgen-independent phenotype for which there is no effective therapy available at present (for reviews, see Refs. 4Crawford E.D.

Cancer. 1993; 71 Suppl. 3: 880-886Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Currently, there is limited information regarding the molecular details of normal prostate function as well as prostate cancer initiation and progression. Several independent approaches resulted in the identification of a few highly prostate-enriched genes that may have unique roles in these processes. The first such gene discovered was prostate-specific antigen (PSA)1 (for a review, see Ref. 6Oesterling J.E. Oncology (Huntingt.). 1991; 5 (discussion 122, 125–126, 128): 107-122PubMed Google Scholar), which is currently used as a diagnostic tool and also as a marker for the progression of prostate cancer, albeit with significant limitations (7Catalona W.J. Southwick P.C. Slawin K.M. Partin A.W. Brawer M.K. Flanigan R.C. Patel A. Richie J.P. Walsh P.C. Scardino P.T. Lange P.H. Gasior G.H. Loveland K.G. Bray K.R.

More recently, several additional prostate-enriched genes were identified including prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) (9Israeli R.S. Powell C.T. Fair W.R. Heston W.D.

Research on these genes and their products is likely to provide detailed information on normal and hyperplastic prostate biology as well as improving disease diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. However, these goals have not yet been realized. While searching for genes that are differentially expressed during early stages of prostate cancer (16Korkmaz K.S. Korkmaz C.G. Ragnhildstveit E. Pretlow T.G. Saatcioglu F. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we have cloned a novel gene, named six transmembrane protein of prostate 1 (STAMP1).STAMP1 is highly specific to prostate for expression. GFP-tagged STAMP1 in immunocytochemistry and time-lapse imaging studies indicate that STAMP1 may have a role in endocytic and/or secretory trafficking pathways. Furthermore,STAMP1 expression is increased in androgen-independent prostate cancer xenografts compared with their androgen-dependent counterparts as well as in prostate tumors compared with normal prostate. These data suggest thatSTAMP1 may have a key role in both normal prostate physiology and the progression of prostate cancer. LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145 cells were routinely maintained and treated as described previously (16Korkmaz K.S. Korkmaz C.G. Ragnhildstveit E. Pretlow T.G. Saatcioglu F. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Transplantation, growth, and harvesting of tumors from mice bearing the CWR22 and CWR22R xenografts were as previously described (17Wainstein M.A., He, F. Robinson D. Kung H.J. Schwartz S. Giaconia J.M. Edgehouse N.L. Pretlow T.P. Bodner D.R. Kursh E.D. Resnick M.I. Seftel A. Pretlow T.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6049-6052PubMed Google Scholar, 18Nagabhushan M. Miller C.M. Pretlow T.P.

A 262-bp cDNA fragment was originally obtained from a screen of a prostate-specific library (16Korkmaz K.S. Korkmaz C.G. Ragnhildstveit E. Pretlow T.G. Saatcioglu F. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and termed L74. RACE (5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends) was performed (oligonucleotide sequences available upon request) using the Marathon-Ready cDNA that was prepared from normal prostate tissue (CLONTECH) and/or SMART-RACE LNCaP cDNA library (CLONTECH) that was generated according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RACE products were cloned into pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen), and positive clones were confirmed by Southern analysis and sequenced. In parallel, a λgt10 cDNA library made from a pool of normal human prostates (CLONTECH) was screened by established procedures (19Ausebel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1997: 4.1-4.10Google Scholar) to obtain additional clones. Ovelapping clones were used to deduce the full-length STAMP1 cDNA sequence. The full-length STAMP1 ORF was amplified by using primers centered around the start and stop codons (sequences available upon request) and fused in-frame to the C terminus of GFP using the vector pcDNA3.1-NT-GFP-TOPO (Invitrogen) to generate GFP-STAMP1. Primary sequence analysis forSTAMP1 was performed in BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Secondary protein structure predictions were performed using the web tools SMART (smart.embl-heidelberg.de/), SOSUI (sosui.proteome.bio.tuat.ac.jp/sosuiframe0E.html), and PSORT (psort.nibb.ac.jp/). Total RNA was prepared by the single step guanidine thiocyanate procedure and used in Northern analysis (19Ausebel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1997: 4.1-4.10Google Scholar). 15 μg of total RNA were used per lane. Probes were generated by random priming and had a specific activity of >3 × 108dpm/μg. A cDNA fragment of STAMP1 spanning 145–2202 bp was used as a probe. Bands were visualized and quantitated by phosphorimaging analysis (Amersham Biosciences). COS-1 cells were transfected by electroporation using a BTX square-wave pulser at 150 V, 1 ms duration. Cells were grown either on coverslips placed in 6-well tissue culture plates for indirect immunofluorescence or on Lab-Tek Chambered Coverglass (Nalge Nunc International) for live-cell microscopy. Transiently transfected cells were observed 18 h after transfection by a Leica TCS-SP confocal microscope using a 488-nm argon laser line. All live-cell experiments were done at 37 °C. Indirect immunofluorescence was carried out as previously described (20Misteli T. Spector D.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 697-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: anti-β-coat protein (β-COP) antiserum (kindly provided by J. Lippincott-Schwartz), anti-mannosidase II (kindly provided by T. Misteli), anti-TGN46 (Serotec, kindly provided by J. S. Bonifacino), and anti-EEA1 (Affinity Biotechnologies). Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies specific for mouse and rabbit were purchased from ICN Biomedicals (Costa Mesa, CA). The STAMP1 riboprobe was made on aSTAMP1 cDNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1339–2074 of STAMP1 cDNA. In parallel and as a negative control, a sense probe was generated corresponding to nucleotides 171–830 of STAMP1 and used in in situ analysis that did not give any specific staining as shown. The procedure was essentially as described previously (51Magi-Galluzzi C. Montironi R. Cangi M.G. Wishnow K. Loda M. Virchows Arch. 1998; 432: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). While searching for prostate-specific genes that are regulated in the early stages of prostate cancer (16Korkmaz K.S. Korkmaz C.G. Ragnhildstveit E. Pretlow T.G. Saatcioglu F. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we cloned a 262-bp novel cDNA fragment, termed L74, which did not show any sequence similarity to the sequences in GenBankTM. By screening a normal prostate cDNA library and by 5′- and 3′-RACE analysis, we obtained the full-length cDNA for L74. Because computer-aided secondary structure prediction of the deduced amino acid sequence of L74 suggested the presence of a six transmembrane domain in its C-terminal half, we named L74 STAMP1. When the full-length STAMP1 cDNA was used in BLAST analysis we found that it completely matched a BAC clone (GenBankTM accession no. AC002064) except for a 313-bp repetitive unit in the 3′-UTR region (data not shown), thereby identifying it as the STAMP1 gene and localizing it to Chr7q21. The repetitive region is likely to be a cloning or sequencing artifact of the BAC clone. Computational exon/intron junction analysis and alignment of the full-length cDNA sequence with the BAC clone revealed that the STAMP1 gene is composed of six exons and five introns (data not shown). The STAMP1 gene spans around 26 kb, which is in part due to the extremely large size of intron 2 (12713 bp). There are three different predicted promoters within 4 kb upstream of the STAMP1 initiation codon (data not shown), none of which has any significant TATA or CAAT box consensus sequences, indicating that STAMP1 is transcribed from a TATA-less promoter. The STAMP1 cDNA has a predicted 5′-UTR of ∼1 kb (deduced by RACE analysis, data not shown) and an unusually long 3′-UTR of ∼4 kb that comprises ∼77% of the total cDNA sequence (data not shown). The ORF starts within the third exon and is predicted to encode a 490 amino acid protein (Fig.1 A). A search for known protein motifs identified six predicted transmembrane domains in the C-terminal half of STAMP1 starting at Phe-209 (Fig. 1 B). BLAST analysis in GenBankTM with the predicted STAMP1 amino acid sequence identified two recently discovered proteins that showed significant similarity to STAMP1 over the entire ORF: the rat protein pHyde (21Steiner M.S. Zhang X. Wang Y. Lu Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4419-4425PubMed Google Scholar), which, when overexpressed, can cause apoptosis in prostate cancer cells and the tumor necrosis factor α-induced adipose-related protein (TIARP) (22Moldes M. Lasnier F. Gauthereau X. Klein C. Pairault J. Feve B. Chambaut-Guerin A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33938-33946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), a mouse protein which may have a role in adipocyte differentiation. TIARP and pHyde are 43 and 51% identical, respectively, to STAMP1 at the amino acid level. In addition, there was significant similarity in the C-terminal half of STAMP1 to STEAP, a recently discovered human cell membrane protein enriched in prostate for expression (23Hubert R.S. Vivanco I. Chen E. Rastegar S. Leong K. Mitchell S.C. Madraswala R. Zhou Y. Kuo J. Raitano A.B. Jakobovits A. Saffran D.C. Afar D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14523-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). An alignment of these sequences is shown in Fig. 1 B. These data suggest that STAMP1, TIARP, and pHyde are structurally, and possibly also functionally, related proteins, and they therefore form a small six transmembrane protein subfamily that does not include STEAP. We next determined the expression profile of STAMP1 in various human tissues by Northern analysis in which a multiple tissue Northern blot was hybridized to the STAMP1 probe. As shown in Fig.2 A, STAMP1hybridized to a major mRNA species of 6.5 kb and three minor mRNA species of 2.2, 4.0, and 4.5 kb in the normal prostate tissue. There was 15–20-fold lower mRNA expression of the 6.5-kb band in the heart, brain, kidney, pancreas, and ovary but not in other tissues. In contrast, the three lower molecular weight species, which are likely to be encoded by alternatively spliced forms ofSTAMP1, 2K. Korkmaz, C. G. Korkmaz, and F. Saatcioglu, unpublished results. were only detectable in the prostate. Hybridization with a glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) cDNA probe resulted in approximately similar signals in all lanes except for the heart and skeletal muscle where G3PDH is known to be more abundant compared with other tissues. These data show that STAMP1 is highly specific to prostate and that it may have isoforms that are restricted to prostate for expression. Because androgen is a major hormonal stimulus for the normal prostate gland and for early stage prostate cancer (3Huggins C. Steven R.E. Hodges C.V. Arch. Surg. 1941; 43: 209-223Crossref Google Scholar), we assessed the possible androgen regulation of STAMP1 by Northern analysis in the androgen responsive prostate cancer cell line LNCaP (24Horoszewicz J.S. Leong S.S. Kawinski E. Karr J.P. Rosenthal H. Chu T.M. Mirand E.A. Murphy G.P. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1809-1818PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were either left untreated or treated with the synthetic androgen R1881 for 24 h and harvested, and total RNA was isolated and used in Northern analysis with STAMP1 cDNA as probe. As shown in Fig. 2 B, STAMP1 displayed similar expression levels in untreated and R1881-treated LNCaP cells. In contrast, the mRNA accumulation of the androgen-regulated geneNKX3.1 dramatically increased upon androgen stimulation in a time-dependent manner, as expected (11He W.W. Sciavolino P.J. Wing J. Augustus M. Hudson P. Meissner P.S. Curtis R.T. Shell B.K. Bostwick D.G. Tindall D.J. Gelmann E.P. Abate-Shen C. Carter K.C.

Gene. 2000; 260: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), reaching ∼10-fold higher levels by 24 h. Time course analysis of androgen treatment did not result in significant differences inSTAMP1 expression.2 These data suggested thatSTAMP1 expression is not significantly regulated by androgens in LNCaP cells. We also assessed the possible regulation of STAMP1expression in an in vivo setting using the recently developed androgen-dependent xenograft model CWR22, which is derived from a primary human prostate tumor (17Wainstein M.A., He, F. Robinson D. Kung H.J. Schwartz S. Giaconia J.M. Edgehouse N.L. Pretlow T.P. Bodner D.R. Kursh E.D. Resnick M.I. Seftel A. Pretlow T.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6049-6052PubMed Google Scholar). Because it is androgen-dependent for growth, the CWR22 tumors in nude mice display marked regression upon castration and may in fact regress completely (17Wainstein M.A., He, F. Robinson D. Kung H.J. Schwartz S. Giaconia J.M. Edgehouse N.L. Pretlow T.P. Bodner D.R. Kursh E.D. Resnick M.I. Seftel A. Pretlow T.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6049-6052PubMed Google Scholar). CWR22 xenografts were grown in nude mice in the presence of a sustained-release testosterone pellet (17Wainstein M.A., He, F. Robinson D. Kung H.J. Schwartz S. Giaconia J.M. Edgehouse N.L. Pretlow T.P. Bodner D.R. Kursh E.D. Resnick M.I. Seftel A. Pretlow T.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6049-6052PubMed Google Scholar). After the tumors had grown, mice were castrated, the testosterone pellets were removed, and the regressing tumors were collected at 1, 2, or 4 weeks postcastration. Total RNA was prepared from these tumor samples and used in Northern analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 B, similar to that observed in LNCaP cells, STAMP1 mRNA accumulation in the CWR22 tumors showed no significant change upon castration and was not significantly affected by the presence of androgens. In contrast, the mRNA accumulation of the androgen-regulated geneNKX3.1 was dramatically decreased upon castration, dropping to ∼4% of precastrate levels by 4 weeks postcastration. These results are consistent with the findings in LNCaP cells and suggest that STAMP1 expression is not significantly regulated by androgens in prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, STAMP1expression was substantially lower in the CWR22 tumors compared with LNCaP cells. We also analyzed the expression profile of STAMP1 in the androgen receptor-negative and therefore androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145, as well as in four independent, relapsed derivatives of CWR22 tumors, named CWR22R (18Nagabhushan M. Miller C.M. Pretlow T.P. Giaconia J.M. Edgehouse N.L. Schwartz S. Kung H.J. de Vere White R.W. Gumerlock P.H. Resnick M.I. Amini S.B. Pretlow T.G. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3042-3046PubMed Google Scholar), which are representative of advanced prostate cancer. Interestingly, there was noSTAMP1 expression in the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 or DU145, similar to that observed forNKX3.1 (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, there was significant STAMP1 expression in tumors from all four independent CWR22R xenograft lines tested, ranging between ∼30 and 60% of that observed in LNCaP cells. A similar overexpression pattern was also observed for NKX3.1 (Fig. 2 B), consistent with previous findings (25Korkmaz K.S. Korkmaz C.G. Ragnhildstveit E. Kizildag S. Pretlow T.G. Saatcioglu F. Gene. 2000; 260: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These data suggest thatSTAMP1 expression may be deregulated once prostate cancer progresses from an androgen-dependent to an androgen-independent state. To gain insight into the cellular localization of STAMP1, we labeled it with GFP to generate GFP-STAMP1. Such use of GFP fusion proteins has recently become a standard method to assess intracellular localization and dynamics of proteins (26Chalfie M., Tu, Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5540) Google Scholar, 27Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4982) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with GFP-STAMP1, fixed, and processed for confocal microscopy. The series of 11 confocal sections along the z-axis were collected through a single cell at nominal 100-nm intervals. Three of the consecutive sections and projection of all 11 sections are shown in Fig. 3 A. In all 11z-plane sections, GFP-STAMP1 showed bright juxtanuclear distribution patterns, characteristic of the Golgi complex. Additionally, GFP-STAMP1 was dispersed in dots with variable size throughout the cytoplasm and at the cell periphery (Fig. 3,z-7, projection). Some of these bright fluorescent spots were tubular (z-6, arrow) or vesicular (z-5, arrow) in morphology. To determine more directly whether GFP-STAMP1 was localized to the Golgi complex, we compared its intracellular distribution with those of two well characterized Golgi markers, the medial Golgi enzyme mannosidase II (ManII) (28Rabouille C. Hui N. Hunte F. Kieckbusch R. Berger E.G. Warren G. Nilsson T. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1617-1627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the coat protein β-COP (29Pepperkok R. Scheel J. Horstmann H. Hauri H.P. Griffiths G. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 71-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). GFP-STAMP1 was transfected into COS-1 cells, which were then fixed and labeled with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies, and then optical sections were analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the distribution of GFP-STAMP1 extended throughout the Golgi complex, as evidenced by significant colocalizations with both ManII and β-COP. However, some areas of non-overlap between the GFP-STAMP1 and both Golgi markers were observed, suggesting that STAMP1, at least in part, is differentially localized within the Golgi complex compared with these two markers. Virtually identical results were obtained by visualization of endogenous STAMP1 in LNCaP cells using a STAMP1-specific antiserum (data not shown). Because GFP-STAMP1 appeared to be associated with vesicular tubular structures (VTS) (Figs. 3 A and4), we assessed whether it may be more specifically localized to the TGN, an important site for the sorting of proteins destined to the plasma membrane, secretory vesicles, or lysosomes (30Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 529-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 31Lemmon S.K. Traub L.M. Curr Opin Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 32Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 2-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To that end, we used an antibody against TGN46, a TGN resident protein that shuttles between the TGN and the plasma membrane, (33Prescott M. Lourbakos A. Bateson M. Boyle G. Nagley P. Devenish R.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 34Ponnambalam S. Banting G. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1076-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) in immunofluorescence microscopy experiments as above. As shown in Fig. 3 B, GFP-STAMP1 extensively (∼80%) co-localized with TGN46, greater than that observed with ManII and β-COP, suggesting that in the Golgi complex STAMP1 is primarily localized to the TGN. To gain insight into the possible function of STAMP1, the kinetic properties of GFP-STAMP1 distribution and trafficking were studied using confocal time-lapse imaging in living cells. COS-1 cells were transfected with GFP-STAMP1. 18 h after transfection, images were captured from live cells every 20 s at 37 °C by confocal laser scanning microscopy (see QuickTime movie sequence at www.biologi.uio.no/mcb/fs/project2.html). As shown in Fig. 4, there was anterograde-retrograde trafficking of GFP-STAMP1 to and from the Golgi complex predominantly in the form of VTS. Some of the VTS followed straight or curvilinear paths, some moved in a stop-and-go fashion, and some showed saltatory movements (see Quicktime movie). The mobile structures indicated at the top panel (white arrows) extended away from and then retracted back to the Golgi. The VTS in the middle panel and the first image in the lower panel (red arrows) detached from the Golgi complex, paused, and moved toward the cell periphery until it disappeared at the cell edge, suggesting that STAMP1 is associated with the secretory pathway. The VTS (yellow arrow) in the lower panel moved from the cell periphery toward the Golgi body, suggesting that STAMP1 is also associated with the endocytic pathway. To probe whether GFP-STAMP1 was associated with the endocytic pathway, we compared the intracellular distribution of GFP-STAMP1 with that of the early endosome protein EEA1 (35Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). GFP-STAMP1 was transfected into COS-1 cells that were then fixed, immunostained with EEA1 antibodies, and observed by laser scanning confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig.5, EEA1 had similar intracellular distribution in both transfected and untransfected cells. Furthermore, GFP-STAMP1 significantly colocalized with EEA1 both in the cell periphery and also in the perinuclear area (Fig. 5, indicated byarrows), suggesting that STAMP1 is associated with early endosomes and the endocytic pathway. Because STAMP1 is highly enriched in the prostate compared with other tissues, we studied its expression in normal prostate and compared it with prostate cancer. To assess the location of STAMP1 expression in prostate tissue and the possible differences in normal compared with neoplastic cells, we performed in situ hybridization analysis on six embedded tissue blocks from prostatectomy specimens (data not shown) or a tissue microarray that contained 46 tissue samples from 13 prostatectomy cases (example shown in Fig. 6). STAMP1 was expressed exclusively in the epithelial cells of the prostate, both in normal and tumor glands (Fig. 6 A). However, the level of STAMP1 expression was higher in the tumor glands, ∼2.5-fold overall, compared with normal epithelium (Fig. 6 B). These data indicate that STAMP1 may directly contribute to, or be a marker for, the progression of prostate cancer. Proteins that contain six transmembrane domains have key roles in a variety of important physiological processes. For example, they function as ion channels (36Catterall W.A. Adv. Neurol. 1999; 79: 441-456PubMed Google Scholar), as signal transducers of painful stimuli (37Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7144) Google Scholar), as water channels or aquaporins (38Echevarria M. Ilundain A.A. J. Physiol. Biochem. 1998; 54: 107-118PubMed Google Scholar), as lipid phosphate phosphatases or LPPs (39Waggoner D.W., Xu, J. Singh I. Jasinska R. Zhang Q.X. Brindley D.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 299-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and as ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins (40Tusnady G.E. Bakos E. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Given these important functions, it is not surprising that deregulation/mutation of some of these proteins is implicated in the pathogenesis of major human diseases such as Alzheimer's (41Haass C. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1996; 9: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and Tangier disease (42Ordovas J.M. Nutr. Rev. 2000; 58: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Because STAMP1 is highly prostate-specific for expression, it is tempting to speculate that deregulation or mutation of STAMP1 may have a role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. STAMP1 shows significant similarity to three recently identified genes. Although there is high sequence similarity with both TIARP and pHyde over the whole ORF, the similarity with STEAP is restricted to the predicted transmembrane domain in the C terminus. In fact, STEAP is a smaller protein and does not have an N-terminal region compared with STAMP1 and TIARP. Both pHyde and STEAP have previously been implicated in the prostate; pHyde for its ability to induce growth arrest and apoptosis of prostate cancer cell lines (21Steiner M.S. Zhang X. Wang Y. Lu Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4419-4425PubMed Google Scholar) and STEAP for its significantly prostate-enriched expression pattern (23Hubert R.S. Vivanco I. Chen E. Rastegar S. Leong K. Mitchell S.C. Madraswala R. Zhou Y. Kuo J. Raitano A.B. Jakobovits A. Saffran D.C. Afar D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14523-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). There is no information on the expression of TIARP in the prostate to date, but our preliminary analysis with the human TIARP cDNA suggests that it has a ubiquitous expression profile, similar to that for human pHyde. 3K. Korkmaz, C. G. Korkmaz, and F. Saatcioglu, unpublished results. Based on the secretory/endocytic pathway localization of GFP-STAMP1, TIARP, pHyde, and STEAP may also be involved in intracellular trafficking pathways. However, there are some differences in their subcellular distribution patterns compared with STAMP1, suggesting that they have distinct functions in the cell. Further work is in progress to assess whether the sequence similarities of these proteins also extend to an overlap in cellular localization and function. To our knowledge, STAMP1 is the first six transmembrane protein described to date that is localized to the Golgi and TGN. Most Golgi-resident proteins studied so far are transmembrane proteins that share a common structure, the majority of which have a single type II transmembrane domain (43Kleene R. Berger E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 283-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 44Natsuka S. Gersten K.M. Zenita K. Kannagi R. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16789-16794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of STAMP1 as a six transmembrane protein in the Golgi suggests that it may have unique functions compared with the other Golgi-resident proteins identified so far. Photobleaching experiments provided evidence that GFP-STAMP1 is rapidly exchanged between different parts of the Golgi with kinetics consistent for it being a transmembrane protein (data not shown), supporting the notion that it indeed functions as a transmembrane protein in the Golgi. In addition, in the presence of Brefeldin A, a known inhibitor of the formation of TGN (45Reaves B. Banting G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 46Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1991; 67: 601-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), GFP-STAMP1 localization to TGN is inhibited which is reversible (data not shown). Further work is needed for the biochemical and functional characterization of STAMP1 in the Golgi and TGN. The Golgi complex has a central role in the secretory pathway (30Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 529-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 31Lemmon S.K. Traub L.M. Curr Opin Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar,47Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Cell. 2000; 101: 693-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 48Lippincott-Schwartz J. Cole N. Presley J. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 16-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is involved in the processing and sorting of proteins and lipids to their final destinations, i.e. to the cell surface, secretory granules, endosomes, or recycling back to the endoplasmic reticulum. Because prostate is a major secretory organ (49Cunha G.R. Donjacour A.A. Cooke P.S. Mee S. Bigsby R.M. Higgins S.J. Sugimura Y. Endocr. Rev. 1987; 8: 338-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar), trafficking through the Golgi is expected to be important and tightly regulated in prostate cells. However, in contrast to some other specialized organs, such as the pancreas (50Arvan P. Castle J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), there is no specific knowledge about functioning of the Golgi in the prostate. For example, it is possible that the secreted molecules of the prostate, such asPSA, are modified or sorted in a regulated fashion in the Golgi complex. Resident enzymes of the Golgi in the prostate, such as STAMP1, may therefore have an important role in this type of regulation. Alternatively, STAMP1 may be a receptor for an endogenous or exogenous ligand that may be delivered to different intracellular compartments through the secretory and endocytic pathways to be involved in cellular processes. Further studies are required to assess these possibilities. An interesting property of STAMP1 expression profile is that it is not expressed in the AR-negative prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and DU145 but is expressed at high levels in the AR-positive cell line LNCaP. It is also present in the CWR22 and CWR22R xenografts, which are AR-positive. Thus, expression of STAMP1 is correlated with the presence of a functional AR in the cell. Whether AR is directly involved in STAMP1 expression will require the characterization of STAMP1 flanking sequences and further functional studies. Another related area to pursue is the expression ofSTAMP1 and its variants in the different cell populations that are found in the prostate. Laser capture microdissection coupled to quantitative RT-PCR is in progress to look for these possible differences. It has been known for over 60 years that androgens play a key role both in the development and maintenance of the normal prostate and the initiation and progression of prostate cancer (3Huggins C. Steven R.E. Hodges C.V. Arch. Surg. 1941; 43: 209-223Crossref Google Scholar). This is the basis for androgen withdrawal therapy, which unfortunately fails in most cases after a few months or years. At this point, there is no effective therapy and prognosis for survival is extremely poor (3Huggins C. Steven R.E. Hodges C.V. Arch. Surg. 1941; 43: 209-223Crossref Google Scholar, 4Crawford E.D.

Cancer. 1993; 71 Suppl. 3: 880-886Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Because STAMP1 expression may be increased during the progression to this advanced state, it may prove to be a useful tool in diagnostic and therapeutic applications for prostate cancer, in addition to helping define the molecular dynamics of the prostate cancer cell.

https://openalex.org/W2136094046,"Upon agonist stimulation, many G protein-coupled receptors such as β2-adrenergic receptors are internalized via β-arrestin- and clathrin-dependent mechanisms, whereas others, like M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), are internalized by clathrin- and arrestin-independent mechanisms. To gain further insight into the mechanisms that regulate M2 mAChR endocytosis, we investigated the post-endocytic trafficking of M2 mAChRs in HeLa cells and the role of the ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) GTPase in regulating M2 mAChR internalization. Here, we report that M2 mAChRs are rapidly internalized by a clathrin-independent pathway that is inhibited up to 50% by expression of either GTPase-defective Arf6 Q67L or an upstream Arf6 activator, Gαq Q209L. In contrast, M2mAChR internalization was not affected by expression of dominant-negative dynamin 2 K44A, which is a known inhibitor of clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Nevertheless, M2 mAChRs, which are initially internalized in structures that lack clathrin-dependent endosomal markers, quickly localize to endosomes that contain the clathrin-dependent, early endosomal markers early endosome autoantigen-1, transferrin receptor, and GTPase-defective Rab5 Q79L, which is known to swell early endosomal compartments. These results suggest that M2mAChRs initially internalize via an Arf6-associated, clathrin-independent pathway but then quickly merge with the clathrin endocytic pathway at the level of early endosomes. Upon agonist stimulation, many G protein-coupled receptors such as β2-adrenergic receptors are internalized via β-arrestin- and clathrin-dependent mechanisms, whereas others, like M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), are internalized by clathrin- and arrestin-independent mechanisms.

G protein-coupled receptor muscarinic acetylcholine receptor ADP-ribosylation factor early endosome autoantigen-1 N-methylscopolamine β2-adrenergic receptor hemagglutinin dynamin plasma membrane phosphate-buffered saline green fluorescent protein wild type Endocytosis is an important mechanism that is used to regulate the activity of a variety of cell surface receptors, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 (1Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 2Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Defining the cellular mechanisms by which GPCR endocytosis is regulated is important for understanding how cells attenuate GPCR signaling as well as understanding the role of receptor endocytosis in cell signaling. Over the past several years, it has become clear that different GPCRs utilize multiple, distinct pathways of internalization that display differential sensitivities to either pharmacological inhibitors or dominant-inhibitory mutants that are pathway-selective. The mechanisms that regulate the internalization of some receptors, such as β2-adrenergic receptors (β2ARs), have been well characterized. However, the mechanisms that regulate both internalization and sorting of other receptors, such as the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR), are not as well understood (3van Koppen C.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).The sequence of events leading to GPCR endocytosis is shared by many receptors. Upon agonist binding, these heptahelical GPCRs activate heterotrimeric G protein signaling pathways, which in turn regulate a variety of intracellular processes (4Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). Many GPCRs then become rapidly phosphorylated either by second messenger kinases such as protein kinase A or by specific G protein receptor kinases on serine/threonine residues present in cytoplasmically exposed domains (5Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). In the case of β2ARs, the critical serine/threonine residues reside in the cytoplasmic tail, whereas in mAChRs, the relevant residues reside in the third intracellular loop (6Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation facilitates the binding of a β-arrestin family member, which inhibits further receptor-G protein coupling and thus attenuates receptor signaling. In many instances, the binding of β-arrestin targets the GPCR to clathrin-coated pits for rapid endocytosis (7Ferguson S.S. Downey 3rd, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G.

Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Dominant-inhibitory mutants of either β-arrestins, the 100-kDa GTPase dynamin, or clathrin heavy chain (Hub mutants) inhibit the internalization of GPCRs such as β2ARs, which use clathrin-dependent mechanisms (1Ferguson S.S.

First, although β-arrestin binding to this receptor is essential for signal attenuation, it is not required for M2mAChR endocytosis in HEK 293 cells (11Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B.

Second, dominant-negative clathrin Hub mutants do not inhibit the agonist-induced M2mAChR internalization (14Vogler O. Nolte B. Voss M. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12333-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Finally, M2 mAChR internalization shows a differential sensitivity to mutants of dynamin, which is required for clathrin- and caveolae-mediated internalization (17Werbonat Y. Kleutges N. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21969-21974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 18Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Mutant dynamin K44A potently inhibits the clathrin-dependent internalization of GPCRs but has little effect on M2 mAChR internalization. However, recent studies have shown that M2 mAChR internalization is strongly inhibited by mutants of dynamin that lack the N-terminal GTP-binding domain (Δ1–272 dynamin) or the K535M dynamin mutant, which cannot be stimulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (17Werbonat Y. Kleutges N. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21969-21974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This suggests that although M2 mAChR internalization is clathrin- and β-arrestin-independent, dynamin is still required. These findings raise the question: what is the endocytic pathway by which M2 mAChRs are internalized? One possible regulator of M2 mAChR trafficking might be the ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) GTPase, which has been shown to influence both clathrin-independent and clathrin-dependent endocytic trafficking.The Arf family of Ras-related GTPases is known to regulate intracellular trafficking processes in both the endocytic and secretory pathways (20Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 21Randazzo P.A. Nie Z. Miura K. Hsu V.W. Sci. STKE. 2000; 2000: RE1Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The Arf6 GTPase, which is located at the plasma membrane (PM) and on endosomal structures, has been shown to influence the actin cytoskeleton (22Radhakrishna H. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 23Boshans R.L. Szanto S. van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Activation of Arf6 can initiate cortical actin rearrangements to form either protrusive structures or lamellar structures in cells (22Radhakrishna H. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 23Boshans R.L. Szanto S. van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3685-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that the effects of Arf6 on membrane traffic and actin rearrangements in cells involves the localized elevation of cellular phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate levels through the stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase α (26Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M. Nakamura H. Watanabe H. Kawamoto K. Nakayama K. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Kanaho Y.

It was shown that agonist-bound β2ARs stimulated the β-arrestin-mediated activation of Arf6, which was required for the efficient internalization of these receptors (32Claing A. Chen W. Miller W.E. Vitale N. Moss J. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42509-42513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that overexpression of the ARF6 exchange factor ARNO stimulates the release of β-arrestin from membrane-docking sites, which then binds to the luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor to mediate desensitization (34Mukherjee S. Gurevich V.V. Jones J.C. Casanova J.E. Frank S.R. Maizels E.T. Bader M.F. Kahn R.A. Palczewski K. Aktories K. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5901-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).In this study, we investigated the intracellular trafficking of the M2 mAChR in HeLa cells. Our studies suggest that M2 mAChRs are rapidly internalized by a clathrin-independent pathway, which is sensitive to mutants of Arf6. After internalization, M2 mAChRs, which are initially observed in structures that lack clathrin-dependent endosomal markers, localize to early endosomes of the clathrin pathway that contain the early endosome autoantigen 1 (EEA-1) and internalized transferrin receptors. Thus, the M2 mAChR appears to utilize a novel endosomal trafficking pathway whereby it is transferred from a clathrin-independent endocytic pathway to endosomal compartments of the clathrin-dependent pathway.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we investigated the intracellular trafficking of the M2 mAChR via a clathrin-independent endocytic pathway in HeLa cells. The M2 receptor has been shown to be internalized in HEK293 cells by a poorly characterized, clathrin- and arrestin-independent mechanism (10Vogler O. Bogatkewitsch G.S. Wriske C. Krummenerl P.

Our present results indicate that persistent activation of the small GTPase Arf6 inhibits M2 mAChR internalization but does not affect the clathrin-mediated internalization of transferrin receptors. Interestingly, following internalization in structures that initially lack clathrin endocytic markers, M2 mAChRs rapidly localize to early endosomes of the clathrin endocytic pathway where they co-localize with the endosomal marker EEA-1 and with internalized Alexa 594-transferrin. This raises the intriguing possibility that although the M2 mAChR is initially internalized via an Arf6-associated pathway, it is quickly transferred to endosomes of the clathrin-dependent pathway.We observed that dominant-inhibitory dynamin 2 K44A did not interfere with the internalization of M2 receptors in HeLa cells but completely blocked the clathrin-dependent internalization of transferrin. This suggested that M2 internalization was clathrin-independent in HeLa cells and is consistent with published reports that the K44A mutant of dynamin does not inhibit M2mAChR internalization in HEK293 cells (10Vogler O. Bogatkewitsch G.S. Wriske C. Krummenerl P. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12155-12160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Recent reports also indicate that M2 mAChRs and angiotensin AT1Areceptors exhibit a differential sensitivity to mutants of dynamin (17Werbonat Y. Kleutges N. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21969-21974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and suggest that although M2 mAChR internalization is clathrin-independent, it still requires dynamin.To gain some insight into the nature of the endocytic pathway followed by M2 mAChR, we investigated the identity of the endosomal structures to which internalized M2 receptors localized. To our surprise, there was extensive overlap in staining between internalized M2 mAChR and the early endosomal marker EEA-1. EEA-1 is a Rab5 effector that is recruited to the cytosolic leaflet of early endosomes in a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-dependent manner (39McBride H.M. Rybin V. Murphy C. Giner A. Teasdale R. Zerial M. Cell. 1999; 98: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). It is involved in both the tethering of vesicles and their subsequent fusion through the assembly of oligomeric complexes that mediate vesicle fusion. Our observations that internalized M2 mAChRs also co-localize to the swollen early endosomal structures induced by expression of constitutively activated Rab5 Q79L lend further support to the early endosomal localization of internalized M2 receptors. A recent study has shown that internalized M4 mAChRs also localize to EEA-1+ endosomes and with internalized transferrin receptors in PC12 cells (40Volpicelli L.A. Lah J.J. Levey A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47590-47598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, M4mAChRs were shown to localize to swollen multivesicular endosomes formed in cells expressing constitutively activated Rab5 Q79L. In other studies, M4 mAChRs have been shown to internalize via arrestin- and clathrin-dependent mechanisms (14Vogler O. Nolte B. Voss M. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12333-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This suggests that different mAChRs that are internalized by distinct mechanisms can meet up in and transit through common endosomal compartments. In support of this hypothesis, we also observed that M2 mAChRs and fluorescently labeled transferrin are initially internalized in distinct endosomal structures but converge into common endosomal structures within 15 min after internalization.But what is the clathrin-independent pathway by which the M2 receptor is initially internalized from the PM? Our results implicate a pathway that is regulated by the Arf6 GTPase. We have previously shown that the Arf6 GTPase regulates a clathrin-independent endocytic pathway between the PM and tubulovesicular endosomes in HeLa cells (25Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Arf6 itself cycles between these two cellular locations according to its GTP cycle (41Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that GTP-bound Arf6 preferentially localizes to the PM, whereas GDP-bound Arf6 localizes to a juxtanuclear tubular endosomal compartment (25Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 41Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Constitutively activated Arf6 Q67L inhibits the internalization of proteins that transit the Arf6-regulated pathway, such as the major histocompatability complex I, whereas GTP binding-defective Arf6 T27N inhibits recycling of such proteins from tubulovesicular endosomes back to the PM (25Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 27Brown F.D. Rozelle A.L. Yin H.L. Balla T. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar).Two observations suggest that the M2 mAChR is also internalized via an Arf6-associated endocytic pathway. First, Arf6 Q67L strongly inhibited the agonist-induced internalization of M2 receptors (Fig. 6) but did not perturb the clathrin-mediated internalization of fluorescently labeled transferrin (Fig. 7). We also observed that M2 mAChRs were sequestered into large endosomal clusters even in the absence of agonist stimulation, where they co-localized with Arf6 Q67L (Fig. 7), suggesting that M2 mAChRs were internalized earlier in the transfection. Brown et al. (27Brown F.D. Rozelle A.L. Yin H.L. Balla T. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) recently reported that major histocompatability complex I co-localizes with Arf6 Q67L after 20 h of transfection in tightly clustered endosomal structures, which accumulate in cells with time after transfection and are highly enriched in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and F-actin. In contrast, after 40 h of transfection, major histocompatability complex I internalization was strongly inhibited by Arf6 Q67L. One explanation for the different temporal effects of Arf6 Q67L on M2 mAChR internalization, which we have observed, is that as endosomal membranes accumulate in cells, further internalization is inhibited because of a depletion of either membrane and/or critical components necessary for vesicle formation.To independently test the effects of persistent Arf6 activation on M2 mAChR endocytosis, we examined the effects of GTPase-defective Gαq Q209L on M2internalization. We observed that co-transfection of M2mAChRs with constitutively activated Gαq Q209L greatly inhibited M2 mAChR internalization and to the same extent as Arf6 Q67L (∼50% inhibition). Constitutively activated Gαq mutants have been shown to enhance Arf6 activation and to mimic, in part, the phenotypic effects of Arf6 Q67L in cells (23Boshans R.L. Szanto S. van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3685-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We have observed that co-expression of wild type Arf6 and Gαq Q209L recreates the surface protrusions observed following aluminum fluoride stimulation of HeLa cells expressing WT Arf6 alone.2 A recent study showed that stimulation of the Gαq-coupled bombesin receptor increased the proportion of GTP-bound Arf6 in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The precise mechanism by which Gαq Q209L enhances Arf6 activation remains to be determined. The observation that persistent activation of Gαq can inhibit M2 mAChR internalization raises the intriguing possibility that Gαq-coupled receptors may influence the behavior of M2 receptor trafficking.We also observed that neither WT Arf6 nor the GTP binding-defective Arf6 T27N mutant affected M2 mAChR internalization (Fig.5). These observations contrast with those of Claing et al.(32Claing A. Chen W. Miller W.E. Vitale N. Moss J. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42509-42513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), who recently showed that both Arf6 Q67L and Arf6 T27N inhibit the clathrin- and arrestin-mediated internalization of β2ARs. These authors also showed that isoproteronol stimulation of β2ARs results in the β-arrestin-dependent stimulation of GTP exchange onto Arf6. Previous work has shown that overexpression of the Arf6-specific GTPase-activating protein GIT1 also inhibits β2AR internalization but not M2receptor internalization (33Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 43Claing A.

One major difference between β2ARs and the M2 mAChR is that the former requires β-arrestins for internalization and the latter does not (11Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12333-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the differential sensitivities of these two receptors to Arf6 mutants is that β-arrestin stimulation of Arf6 activation is not critical for M2 mAChR internalization but is important for β2AR internalization. These results raise the exciting possibility that Arf6 can differentially affect GPCR internalization via both clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent mechanisms. The significance of such a dual role for Arf6 in endocytic trafficking along distinct pathways is unknown.Taken together, our results indicate that the clathrin-independent internalization of the M2 mAChR initially follows an Arf6-associated endocytic pathway but then quickly merges with early endosomes of the clathrin-dependent pathway. From these EEA-1+ endosomes, M2 mAChRs either can recycle back to the PM, can remain sequestered in endosomes by unknown mechanisms, or eventually could be sorted to lysosomes for degradation. Given the differential effects of Arf6 on the clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent internalization of GPCRs, determining the mechanisms by which Arf6 exerts its effects on these two endocytic pathways will be an important goal for future studies. Endocytosis is an important mechanism that is used to regulate the activity of a variety of cell surface receptors, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 (1Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 2Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Defining the cellular mechanisms by which GPCR endocytosis is regulated is important for understanding how cells attenuate GPCR signaling as well as understanding the role of receptor endocytosis in cell signaling. Over the past several years, it has become clear that different GPCRs utilize multiple, distinct pathways of internalization that display differential sensitivities to either pharmacological inhibitors or dominant-inhibitory mutants that are pathway-selective. The mechanisms that regulate the internalization of some receptors, such as β2-adrenergic receptors (β2ARs), have been well characterized. However, the mechanisms that regulate both internalization and sorting of other receptors, such as the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR), are not as well understood (3van Koppen C.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The sequence of events leading to GPCR endocytosis is shared by many receptors. Upon agonist binding, these heptahelical GPCRs activate heterotrimeric G protein signaling pathways, which in turn regulate a variety of intracellular processes (4Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). Many GPCRs then become rapidly phosphorylated either by second messenger kinases such as protein kinase A or by specific G protein receptor kinases on serine/threonine residues present in cytoplasmically exposed domains (5Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). In the case of β2ARs, the critical serine/threonine residues reside in the cytoplasmic tail, whereas in mAChRs"

Helix D is parallel to the lumenal surface because of its amphiphilic nature. The first (A) and third (B) transmembrane helices and the putative Chl-binding ligands are highly conserved in all family members (6Pichersky E. Jansson S. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F.

All of the mutant proteins yielded a folded complex upon reconstitution, as shown by the appearance of a green band upon sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, but mutant A1, an indication that the Glu148 (helix A)-Arg49 (helix B) ionic bridge is essential for stabilization of Lhca1, as previously observed in CP29 (13Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The green bands were harvested with a syringe and submitted to anion exchange chromatography to remove unspecifically bound pigments. The eluate was concentrated, and the aggregation state of Lhca1 WT and mutant proteins was investigated by ultracentrifugation into a density gradient that was shown to be effective in separating monomers from dimers and free pigments (10Schmid V.H.R. Cammarata K.V. Bruns B.U. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7667-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As a reference we used WT Lhca1/Lhca4 heterodimer produced by co-refolding the two apoproteins with pigments in the presence of lipids (10Schmid V.H.R. Cammarata K.V. Bruns B.U. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7667-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).2 In agreement with previous work (10Schmid V.H.R. Cammarata K.V. Bruns B.U. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7667-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), recombinant WT Lhca1 was monomeric and did not form homodimers or higher order aggregates. Fig. 1 shows the result of glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation of WT and three representative Lhca1 mutants, showing that they all have a sedimentation rate corresponding to monomeric aggregation state as was the case for the all mutant proteins not shown in the figure. The yield of reconstitution was differentially affected by each mutation, ranging from 90% of WT yield in the case of mutant B3 to 20% of WT yield in the case mutant A3 (A2, 55%; A4, 25%; A5, 75%; B5, 50%; and B6, 75%). Irrespective of the yield, the complex obtained showed the same mobility in the glycerol gradient, suggesting that no important changes were produced by the mutation in the overall structure of the complex. When native LHCI from Arabidopsiswas ultracentrifuged in the same conditions, it exhibited the same sedimentation rate as the recombinant Lhca1/Lhca4 heterodimer (not shown) (25Croce R. Bassi R. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1998: 421-424Google Scholar).2The stability of the reconstituted holoproteins, as studied by the kinetic of CD signal decay with increasing temperature, is reported in Table II. Mutant at the site B3 ligand did not show a significant decrease in stability with respect to WT. The remaining mutations all produced a decrease in stability in the range of 20–30% as compared with WT.Table IIPigment composition of the Lhca1 mutantsSampleSiteStabilityChl a/bChl/carPigments per 100 Chl a2-aAverage error, 5%.Vx/LuChl totChl bNxVxLu°CWT54.1 ± 1.93.97 ± 0.133.35 ± 0.1825.21.813.022.70.5710N151VA245.3 ± 2.44.07 ± 0.153.43 ± 0.1024.51.512.422.40.567.9 ± 0.6Q165LA346.1 ± 1.53.51 ± 0.033.31 ± 0.1728.52.417.718.70.947.3 ± 0.9E44V/R153LA448.8 ± 0.45.62 ± 0.193.74 ± 0.1517.81.410.319.70.527.7 ± 0.6H47FA539.2 ± 4.65.71 ± 0.273.48 ± 0.1017.51.57.924.50.328.2 ± 0.8H181FB353.7 ± 2.13.79 ± 0.163.14 ± 0.0926.40.915.224.10.639.0 ± 0.6E110VB538.7 ± 37.82 ± 0.063.79 ± 0.0812.80.66.922.60.307.9 ± 0.5E102VB642.9 ± 2.95.66 ± 0.304.09 ± 0.2317.70.26.522.00.309.4 ± 0.5The stability values are the averages of three measurements.

Open table in a new tab Pigment CompositionThe pigment composition of the mutant holoproteins was analyzed by HPLC and fitting of the spectra of the acetone extracts with the spectra of the individual pigments. The results are summarized in Table II. Interestingly, most of the mutants showed an increase of the Chl a/b ratio compared with WT. This was surprising; an opposite effect was expected because Lhca1 binds eight Chls a and two Chls b, and therefore the majority of the mutations should affect Chl a-binding sites and thus lead to a decrease in Chl a/b ratio. Nevertheless, a clear loss of Chl a was only observed in case of mutations at sites A3 and B3, whereas the mutations at sites A4, A5, B5, and B6 showed a loss of Chl b. It is interesting to note that most of the complexes were also affected in xanthophyll binding as shown by an increase of the Chl/carotenoid ratio in five mutants of seven. The violaxanthin/Lu ratio also changed in most cases, with a preferential loss of violaxanthin in mutants A5, B5, and B6 and of lutein in mutant A3, indicating at least partial selectivity of the carotenoid-binding sites.The above results imply that both Chls and carotenoids were lost as a consequence of the mutations at most of the Chl-binding residues. To support this finding, pigment/protein stoichiometry was measured for each mutant protein. The results are summarized in TableII. It clearly appears that only in two mutant proteins, namely B3 and B6, a single chlorophyll was lost, whereas mutations at sites A2, A3, A4, A5, and B5 brought the loss of two or three Chls. It was also confirmed that all of the mutants except for the one in site B3 lost part of their xanthophyll complement together with Chls ligands (TableII).Absorption SpectraBinding to individual sites has been shown to tune transition energy of each chromophore to different levels that determine pathway of energy equilibration within Lhc proteins. Further complexity is added to the system by pigment/pigment interactions producing additional energy levels. To determine the absorption properties of Chls in individual binding sites, the absorption spectra of WT and mutant Lhca proteins were recorded at 100 K (Fig.2) and at room temperature (not shown). At least five Chl a (662, 669, 676, 682, and 688 nm) and two Chls b (644 and 651 nm) absorption forms have been reported as components of Lhca1 spectrum.2 The main absorption peak was found at 680.5 and 678.5 nm at room temperature and 100 K, respectively, whereas a shoulder from Chl b absorption was detected at around 645 nm. Mutant proteins showed a blue shift of the major peak, thus implying that most of the mutations affected the environment of Chl a chromophores. In particular, WT minus mutant difference spectra (e.g. Figs. 6, 7, and 8 A) indicated that spectral forms at 680 nm were associated to both sites A2 and A3, whereas a 663-nm form was clearly lacking in the mutant at site B3. A special feature of LHCI proteins is the presence of low amplitude, red-shifted, absorption forms. These are responsible for long wavelength fluorescence emission and can be detected at the long wavelength edge of the spectrum. Mutations at sites A5, B5, and B6 clearly showed a reduction in this red tail. These mutants also showed a decreased absorption at 644 nm, indicating a loss of Chl b.Figure 2Absorption spectra at 100 K of all reconstituted complexes.

Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This is due to the loss of more than one Chl upon mutation of a single Chl-binding ligand. An additional source of complexity is that pigments bound to mutant proteins may undergo frequency shift with respect to their absorption in the WT protein because of the loss of interacting neighbor pigments. In this case, two spectral effects combine: (i) the loss of forms originating from pigment-pigment interactions and (ii) the appearance of shifted absorption(s) from the residual noninteracting partner of a disrupted pair. In an attempt to gather more detailed information on the spectroscopic effects of mutations, we have analyzed LD spectra of WTversus mutant Lhca1 proteins. LD signals depend not only on absorption wavelength but also on the orientation of the dipole transition moment, thus allowing discrimination of individual chromophores with similar transition energy but different orientations. The LD spectra of WT and mutants at 100 K are reported in Fig. 3 as normalized to the Chl a Qy peak. The LD spectrum of WT Lhca1 holoprotein is characterized by a negative signal at 642 nm and two positive components at 652 and 679.8 nm. Only mutants B5 and B6 are affected in the amplitude of the 642 nm signal. The positive 680-nm signal from the Chl a Qy transition was essentially unaffected by most mutations, showing at the most a minor red shift, except in the case of the A2 mutant whose spectrum was shifted to 677 nm. This indicates that a Chl a ligand in site A2 is responsible for most of the 680-nm LD signal. Mutants A4 and A5 lost positive LD around 677 nm, and their peaks are slightly red-shifted (by 0.8 and 0.4 nm, respectively), suggesting that the missing chromophores contribute to the blue edge of the main Chl a LD peak. Changes were observed in the 660–670-nm region for all of the mutant proteins. In particular, mutant A5 showed a strong negative contribution at 670 nm, whereas a negative contribution around 665 nm can be detected in mutants A3 and B3.Figure 3Linear dichroism spectra at 100 K of Lhca1 complexes.

This should yield excitonic interactions that can be studied by circular dichroism. To test the presence of pigment/pigment interactions, CD spectra of all complexes were measured and are reported in Fig.4. On the basis of the CD pattern in the 600–750-nm range, the mutants can be classified in two categories: (i) mutants A2, A3, and A4 showed the loss of a 683-nm (−) contribution and an increase of signal at 672 nm (+) (Fig. 4 A) and (ii) mutants A5, B5, and B6 showed an increased amplitude of a 685 nm (−) signal and the disappearance of a contribution at 668 nm (−) (Fig. 4 B). In the Soret region, changes in the CD spectrum were also detected; mutants A5 and B5 lost the major positive signal at 412 nm. They also lost a negative contribution at 501 nm, probably associated to a carotenoid molecule. This signal is possibly correlated to a contribution (+) at 430 nm, which decreases in the same mutants, suggesting the presence of a xanthophyll/Chl a interaction. An opposite effect was detected in the CD spectrum of the A2 mutant, where an increase of both signals was observed along with a shift to the blue of the 497 nm (−) contribution. The signal in the 470–520-nm region is possibly the result of different effects; in the A3 mutant, the new positive contribution at 490 nm is probably related to the absence of a negative signal at this wavelength. Based on the biochemical data, which indicated loss of lutein in the A3 mutant, the negative signal at 490 nm can be attributed to this xanthophyll species. Also in this case, a decrease of the 430 nm (+) contribution can be observed, thus suggesting a lutein/Chl a interaction.Figure 4Circular dichroism spectra at 10 °C of Lhca1 complexes.

A. 1997; 94: 7667-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).2 Mutants A2, A3, A4, and B3 show emission peak wavelengths identical to that of WT. The red-shifted component, however, has a higher amplitude in mutants A3 and A4, thus suggesting the loss of bulk Chl a without affecting the pigment-binding domain responsible for the low energy forms. The second group of mutants, namely A5, B5, and B6, showed a blue shift of the major peak by 2–3 nm and a decreased amplitude of low energy emission. The emission spectra of selected mutants, i.e. A4 and A5, at 100 K are presented in Fig. 5, together with the spectrum of WT Lhca1.Figure 5Fluorescence emission spectra at 100 K.Lhca1 WT (dotted line), A4 (solid line), and A5 (dashed line) are shown.

Cinque G. Bassi R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The kinetic of Qy band absorption decay, upon strong illumination in the presence of O2, showed two kind of different behavior; mutants A2, A3, and B3 were similar to WT, whereas mutants A5, B5, and B6 were more sensitive to photobleaching (Fig. 6). Mutant A4 showed a somehow intermediate behavior; although the initial rate (0–5 min) of decay was as fast as those of the most sensitive mutants, longer times of exposure yielded a slow bleaching similar to that of WT.DISCUSSIONEnergy transfer within Lhc proteins is defined by the distance between chromophores, by their transition energy, and by the mutual orientation of transition vectors (26Forster T. Sinanoglu O. Modern Quantum Chemistry: Action of Light and Organic Crystals. Academic Press, New York1965: 93-137Google Scholar, 27Knox R.S. Govindjee Bioenergetics of Photosynthesis: Cell Biology. Academic Press, New York1975: 183-221Google Scholar). Determination of these major parameters has been difficult to obtain in higher plant antenna proteins by spectroscopic methods because of the high number of bound chromophores having their spectra overlapping the Qy band. Recently, introduction of mutation analysis of Chl-binding residues allowed the interchange of individual amino acid residues, coordinating Chls through their central Mg2+ atom, and determination of individual chromophore spectra by difference spectroscopy. The case of CP29 (Lhcb4) was the simplest. This protein binds eight Chls and two xanthophylls, which have, if any, very weak excitonic interactions between each other (23Giuffra E. Zucchelli G. Sandona D. Croce R. Cugini D. Garlaschi F.M. Bassi R. Jennings R.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12984-12993Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Each mutation led to the removal of a single Chl, and an individual spectral form was detected in the absorption difference spectrum (13Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 28Simonetto R. Crimi M. Sandona D. Croce R. Cinque G. Breton J. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12974-12983Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A somewhat more complex situation was found in the major antenna protein LHCII (Lhcb1) that binds 12 Chl/polypeptide and shows excitonic interactions between a subset of its chromophores. Some Lhcb1 mutations caused removal of single Chls from the protein and of individual spectral forms. Other mutations led to the loss of multiple Chls and of excitonic interactions as detected by both absorption band shifts and by the disappearance of conservative CD signals (14Remelli R. Varotto C. Sandona D. Croce R. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33510-33521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the present study, mutation analysis was applied to Lhca1, a protein binding ten Chls and three xanthophylls.2This pigment protein was stable upon reconstitution in vitrofrom the apoprotein overexpressed in E. coli and purified pigments. Moreover, the recombinant protein showed characteristics corresponding to those of the native protein as judged by its capacity of forming heterodimers with Lhca4, which exhibited spectral features typical of native LHCI (10Schmid V.H.R.

The two major codominant alleles of the JKgene, JK*A and JK*B, have a similar frequency in Caucasian populations (0.51 and 0.49, respectively) and define the three common phenotypes Jk(a+b-), Jk(a-b+), and Jk(a+b+) (17Race R.R. Sange R. Blood Groups in Man. Blackwell, Oxford1975: 178-260Google Scholar, 18Daniels G. Human Blood Groups. Blackwell, Oxford1995: 440-451Google Scholar). The genetic basis of the JK*A/JK*B blood group polymorphism is a single nucleotide transition G838A changing Asp-280 to Asn-280 in the Jka and Jkb polypeptide, respectively (19Olives B. Merriman M. Bailly P. Bain S. Barnett A. Todd J. Cartron J.P. Merriman T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1017-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because of hUT-B1, RBCs do not undergo excessive cell volume changes during their transit in the vasa recta irrigating the hypertonic renal medulla. In addition, they participate in medulla urea sequestration by taking up urea when flowing in the descending vasa recta and subsequently releasing urea when flowing in the ascending vasa recta (20Macey R.I. Yousef L.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: C669-C674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of hUT-B1 in the endothelium descending vasa recta enables a countercurrent exchange of urea with the ascending vasa recta, a process that also contributes to the urea medulla gradient required for water reabsorption. More recently, renal rUT-B1 has been shown to be regulated by antidiuretic hormone independently from medulla hypertonicity (16Trinh-Trang-Tan, M.-M., Lasbennes, F., Gane, P., Roudier, N., Ripoche, P., Cartron, J. P., and Bailly, P. (2002) Am. J. Physiol.280, in pressGoogle Scholar). Despite these functional properties, hUT-B1 deficiency, which occurs in the rare human phenotype called Jknull (21Pinkerton F.J. Mermod L.E. Liles B.A. Jack J.A., Jr. Noades J. Vox Sang. 1959; 4: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), is not associated with any obvious clinical syndrome, except for mild urinary concentration defect, which is, however, more severe in transgenic UT-B null mice (22Sands J.M. Gargus J.J. Frohlich O. Gunn R.B. Kokko J.P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1992; 2: 1689-1696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Yang B. Bankir L. Gillespie A. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10633-10637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The absence of UT-B1 prevents Jknull RBCs from releasing urea as they traverse the ascending vasa recta, thus decreasing the efficiency of the countercurrent exchange and the renal concentration ability. Although a very rare form of Jknull may be inherited as a dominant character, most result from homozygous inheritance of a silent allele at the JK locus (18Daniels G. Human Blood Groups. Blackwell, Oxford1995: 440-451Google Scholar) and may arise by at least four distinct molecular mechanisms: (i) splice site mutations causing the skipping of either exon 6 or exon 7 (5Lucien N. Sidoux-Walter F. Olives B. Moulds J., Le Pennec P.Y. Cartron J.P. Bailly P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12973-12980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), (ii) missense mutation resulting in a S291P substitution (24Sidoux-Walter F. Lucien N. Nissinen R. Sistonen P. Henry S. Moulds J. Cartron J.P. Bailly P. Blood. 2000; 96: 1566-1573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), (iii) nonsense mutation resulting in a Y194Stop substitution (25Irshaid N.M. Eicher N.I. Hustinx H. Poole J. Olsson M.L. Br. J. Haematol. 2002; 116: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and (iv) partial deletion within the JK locus encompassing exons 4 and 5 (26Lucien N. Chiaroni J. Cartron J.P. Bailly P. Blood. 2002; 99: 1079-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). hUT-B1 is a hydrophobic polypeptide of 389 amino acid residues with a 42.5 kDa apparent molecular mass, which is reduced to 36 kDa following deglycosylation. Of the 10 cysteine residues present in hUT-B1 and hUT-A2 proteins, 7 are conserved and aligned at equivalent positions, but 3 (Cys-25, Cys-30, and Cys-151 on hUT-B1) are present at distinct positions (Fig. 1) (11Olives B. Neau P. Bailly P. Hediger M.A. Rousselet G. Cartron J.P. Ripoche P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31649-31652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The predicted membrane topology based on hydropathy plots consists of two repeated hydrophobic domains spanning the membrane five times each, linked by a large extracellular loop carrying a single N-glycan chain attached to Asn-211 (Fig. 1) (11Olives B. Neau P. Bailly P. Hediger M.A. Rousselet G. Cartron J.P. Ripoche P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31649-31652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sidoux-Walter F. Lucien N. Nissinen R. Sistonen P. Henry S. Moulds J. Cartron J.P. Bailly P. Blood. 2000; 96: 1566-1573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each repeat contains a conserved sequence motif (LPXXTXPF), suggesting an internal duplication (27Rousselet G. Ripoche P. Bailly P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F554-F555PubMed Google Scholar). According to the predicted model, both the N-terminal stretch of 60 amino acids and the C-terminal domain of 35 amino acids are on the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane, and the common JK*A/JK*B polymorphism resulting from the D280N substitution (19Olives B. Merriman M. Bailly P. Bain S. Barnett A. Todd J. Cartron J.P. Merriman T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1017-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) is located in the fourth extracellular loop (Fig. 1). With this unusual pattern of hydrophobicity, about 70% of hUT-B1 is embedded in the cell membrane, a feature also observed with the isoforms of UT-A gene (3Sands J.M. Timmer R.T. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F321-F339PubMed Google Scholar). Upon expression inXenopus oocytes, hUT-B1 confers a high urea permeability, which is strongly inhibited by phloretin but poorly inhibited bypara-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate (pCMBS) (28Sidoux-Walter F. Lucien N. Olives B. Gobin R. Rousselet G. Kamsteeg E.J. Ripoche P. Deen P.M. Cartron J.P. Bailly P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30228-30235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This result is surprising in view of the fact that urea permeability of human RBCs is decreased by both inhibitors (29Macey R.I. Farmer R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 211: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). This discrepancy remains to be clarified. The present report has four purposes: (i) to provide direct evidence that hUT-B1 carries the Jk blood group antigens by flow cytometry analysis of Jk-K562 transfectants, (ii) to analyze the membrane topology of hUT-B1 in the RBC membrane, (iii) to characterize the urea transport mediated by hUT-B1 in an erythroid context by expressing the protein in the K562 erythroleukemic cell line, and (iv) to examine the structure-function relationship with respect to plasma membrane targeting and pCMBS sensitivity of the hUT-B1 protein. RBC samples from individuals of common and rare Jk phenotypes were obtained from the Centre National de Reáfeárence sur les Groupes Sanguins (CNRGS, Paris, France). Restriction endonucleases and modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Hertfordshire, UK). The [14C]urea (1.96 GBq/mmol) and the [3H]raffinose (188.7 GBq/mmol) came from Amersham Biosciences and PerkinElmer Life Sciences, respectively. Pwo DNA polymerase from Roche Molecular Biochemicals was used for PCR amplification. Nucleotide sequences were determined on both strands with ThermoSequenase fluorescently labeled primer cycle sequencing kit from Amersham Biosciences using 5′(Cy5) primers (Genset, Paris, France) and an automated Alf-Express sequencer (AmershamBiosciences). The human antiserum containing an alloanti-Jk3 was obtained from an immunized Jk(a-b-) individual also called Jknull. The human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) anti-Jka (IgM, MS15) or anti-Jkb (IgM, MS8) and the human polyclonal antisera anti-Jka or anti-Jkb were from Biotest AG (Dreieich, Germany). Rabbit polyclonal antisera and affinity purified antibodies directed against the N-terminal region (anti-Nter, residues 8–22) or the C-terminal region (anti-Cter, residues 377–389) of the hUT-B1/Jk protein were described previously (8Olives B.

Human erythroleukemic K562 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were grown in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium with Glutamax-1 (Invitrogen) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin and 10% fetal calf serum. To establish a stable cell line expressing the Kidd/urea transporter, hUT-B1 cDNAs (nucleotides −9 to 1182) carrying either a G838 (JK*A allele) or an A838 (JK*B allele) were amplified by PCR from the Jka/Jkb-pT7TS constructs (19Olives B. Merriman M. Bailly P. Bain S. Barnett A. Todd J. Cartron J.P. Merriman T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1017-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) using SP-1 and AS-1 primers (see Table I), subcloned into the pCEP4 episomal expression vector (Invitrogen), and transfected into K562 cells using the Lipofectin reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Stable transfectants resistant to hygromycin (300 μg/ml) were selected for Jk antigen expression by immunomagnetic separation using a human anti-Jk3 antiserum and Biomag Goat anti-human-IgG (PerSeptive Biosystems, Connecticut, MA). Stable clones were isolated, and Jka, Jkb, and Jk3 antigens expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. Briefly, K562 transfectants (3–5 × 105) were incubated for 60 min at 22 °C with appropriate antibodies used at saturating concentration and then washed and stained with 100 μl of phycoerythrin-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragments of goat anti-human IgG diluted 1:40 (Coulter/Immunotech, Marseille, France). After another washing step, 20 nm TO-PRO-1, Molecular Probes (Interchim, Montluçon, France) was added to the cell suspension 15 min before FACScan analysis (BD PharMingen) to exclude dead cells (TO-PRO positive-cells).Table ISequence and position of primers used for PCR amplification and mutagenesis*, SP and AS for sense and antisense primer, respectively. **, The nucleotides encoding the amino acid substitutions are boldface type and double underlined. #, Position +1 refers to the first nucleotide of the initiation codon (GenBank™ accession number Y19039).

RBC membranes of known ABO phenotypes were prepared by hypotonic lysis (30Steck T.L. Kant J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar) and solubilized in 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl containing 5% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride (AEBSF, Interchim). The clear supernatant (22,000 × g for 30 min) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with affinity-purified antibody anti-Nter of hUT-B1 (see above), and immunoprecipitates were purified on Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences), washed, and eluted by heating as described (31Bloy C. Blanchard D. Lambin P. Goossens D. Rouger P. Salmon C. Cartron J.P. Blood. 1987; 69: 1491-1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE (15% separating gel) and immunoblotted by reaction with the murine mAbs anti-A (clone 26W2, CNRGS, Paris, France) (1:10 dilution), anti-B (Ortho Diagnostic System, Raritan, NJ) (1:5 dilution), or the affinity-purified antibody anti-Cter of hUT-B1 (10 μg/ml). Bound antibodies were detected with alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG(H+L) (1:800 dilution) and CDP-Star chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Right-side-out (ROVs) and inside-out (IOVs) vesicles were prepared from Jk-positive RBCs and purified through a barrier of 8% (w/v) dextran T70, as described previously (32Boyle J.M. Whetton A.D. Dexter T.M. Meeran K. Baldwin S.A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3093-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). One volume of each rabbit polyclonal serum anti-Nter or anti-Cter of hUTB1 was mixed for 2 h at 37 °C with 4 volumes of sealed vesicles at the protein concentration of 2.5 mg/ml and subsequently centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. Free antibodies in the supernatants and the bound antibodies eluted from the vesicles by the digitonin method (33Jenkins D.E., Jr. Moore W.H. Transfusion. 1977; 17: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were analyzed by Western blot on Jk-positive RBC membrane proteins separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose sheets (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH; 0.1 μm). Bound antibodies were detected with alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:800 dilution) and the alkaline phosphatase substrate kit (Bio-Rad). All primers used are given in TableI. Single point mutations C25S, C30S, C151S, N211I, and C236S were introduced into the Jkaallelic cDNA using a two-step PCR approach with the common SP-1 and AS-1 primers, in addition to sequence-specific mutagenic primers overlapping each other, AS-2 to 6 and SP-2 to 6, respectively. The second PCR was performed with 1/100 of each two first PCR reactions. The double mutation C25S,C30S was generated similarly using the Jka cDNA carrying the single mutation C25S as initial PCR matrix. Deletions of nucleotide sequences encoding the first 59 (ΔN) or the last 30 (ΔC) amino acids of the Jkapolypeptide were generated by PCR amplification between SP-ΔN and AS-1 or SP-1 and AS-ΔC primers, respectively. The double N- and -C-terminal deletion (ΔN+ΔC) construct was obtained using SP-ΔN and AS-ΔC primers. For efficient translation, artificial ATG codon and Stop codon were inserted at the 5′ end of the SP-ΔN and AS-ΔC primers, respectively. All PCR amplifications were done under stringent conditions: 94 °C for 45 s (1 cycle); 94 °C for 45 s, 58–72 °C depending of primer pairs used for 30 s, 72 °C for 60 s (30 cycles); 72 °C for 1 min (1 cycle). All mutant Jka cDNAs were subcloned into theEcoRV-digested pT7TS plasmid (kindly provided by P. Krieg, Austin, TX) except for the C151S and C236S mutants, which were subcloned into KpnI-HindIII-digested pCEP4 vector and transfected into K562 cells as described above. All constructs were sequenced on both strands using an automated Alf-Express sequencer (Amersham Biosciences) or an ABI-Prism 310 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA) to confirm that the correct junctions/mutations were obtained. Capped sense RNAs were transcribed in vitro from the pT7TS-cDNA constructs linearized withSmaI restriction enzyme using T7 polymerase and the mCAP mRNA capping kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Expression studies were carried out by microinjection of each cRNA (0.1 ng/oocyte in 50 nl) in collagenase-treated Xenopus laevisoocytes, and functional tests were performed 3 days after injection as described previously (24Sidoux-Walter F. Lucien N. Nissinen R. Sistonen P. Henry S. Moulds J. Cartron J.P. Bailly P. Blood. 2000; 96: 1566-1573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sidoux-Walter F. Lucien N. Olives B. Gobin R. Rousselet G.

In urea transport inhibition experiments, oocytes were incubated in 1 mm pCMBS (Sigma) or 1 mm phloretin (Sigma) for 20 and 10 min, respectively, before and during the assay at 18 °C. From the same oocyte batches, groups of three to six oocytes without chorionic membrane were embedded in paraffin as described (34McLean I.W. Nakane P.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). Sections (7 μm thick) were stained overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml of affinity-purified antibodies anti-Nter or anti-Cter and visualized with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature (35Mulders S.M. Knoers N.V. Van Lieburg A.F. Monnens L.A. Leumann E. Wuhl E. Schober E. Rijss J.P. Van Os C.H. Deen P.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 242-248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Water and solute transport analysis were performed at 15 °C by following the 90° light scattering variations (λexc: 530 nm) using a stopped flow spectrophotometer (SFM3, Biologic, Claix, France) as described previously (36Laize V. Rousselet G. Verbavatz J.M. Berthonaud V. Gobin R. Roudier N. Abrami L. Ripoche P. Tacnet F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). 60 μl of phosphate-buffered saline washed K562 cells resuspended at the density of 0.5–1.0 × 107 cells/ml were mixed to an equal volume of hypertonic solution containing solutes (sorbitol or urea) to create an inwardly directed osmotic gradient of 150 mosm/kg of H2O, and the scattered light intensity variation was followed. The first part of the curve corresponded to a water efflux to osmotically equilibrate cells with the external medium and allowed to calculate the osmotic water permeability coefficient (Pf). Data averaged from 5 to 10 time courses were fitted to a double exponential function by using the simplex procedure of the Biokine software (Biologic), and the apparentP′f was calculated according to the equation:P′f =kexp·Vo/S·Vw·((Cin/V(t)) − Cout) where Kexp is the first exponential rate constant;V(t) is the relative volume of the K562 cells at time, t;Vosm/S is the ratio of cell osmolyte volume to cell surface area (7.94 10−5 cm);Vw is the molar volume of water (18 cm3/mol), and Cin andCout are the initial concentrations of total solute inside and outside the cells, respectively. The second part of the curve, which was only observed with Jk transfectants in urea condition, resulted from cell swelling as water accompanied urea influx to maintain the osmotic equilibrium. The analysis of this part of the curve was fitted to a single exponential function using the same software as indicated above, and the apparent P′urea was calculated using the following equation: P′urea =kexp·(Impout+Permout)/S·((I′o·V′o/V(t))− Impout) (37Gerbeau P. Guclu J. Ripoche P. Maurel C. Plant J. 1999; 18: 577-587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where I′o andV′o represent the initial concentration of the impermeant solute and the cell volume, respectively. Impoutand Permout were the external concentrations of impermeant and permeable solutes, respectively. In some experiments, pCMBS (0.1–3.0 mm) was added to the cells and hypertonic media 15 min before the shrinkage-swelling measurement. Reversibility was carried out after addition of 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). As Northern blot analysis revealed that the K562 erythroleukemic cell line lacked hUT-B1 transcripts (not shown), stable transfectants expressing the hUT-B1/Jka and hUT-B1/Jkb allelic cDNAs were established in these cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that polyclonal antiserum anti-Jka strongly reacted with K562-Jka but not K562-Jkb transfectants, whereas antiserum anti-Jkb strongly reacted with K562-Jkb but not K562-Jka transfectants (Fig.2). Identical results were obtained with human mAbs directed against Jka and Jkbantigens (not shown). The geometric mean of fluorescence was higher with Jkb as compared with Jka transfectants (Fig. 2), presumably because of a better transfection efficiency. As expected, both transfectants reacted with the human alloanti-Jk3, indicating that both the JK*A and JK*B alleles also encode the Jk3 antigenic specificity. In contrast, parental K562 cells did not react with antibodies directed against Jka, Jkb, or Jk3 antigens (Fig. 2). Although hUT-B1 is known to carry a single N-glycan attached to Asn-211 (Fig. 1) (24Sidoux-Walter F. Lucien N. Nissinen R. Sistonen P. Henry S. Moulds J. Cartron J.P. Bailly P. Blood. 2000; 96: 1566-1573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it has not been determined whether this oligosaccharide chain may carry some blood group determinants. To address this issue, the hUT-B1 protein was immunopurified from RBCs of known ABO blood group phenotypes with the affinity-purified anti-Nter antibody to hUT-B1, and the immunoprecipitate was submitted to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with murine mAbs anti-A or anti-B. hUT-B1 from blood group A individuals was detected with mAb anti-A only, and hUT-B1 from B individuals was detected with mAB anti-B only, whereas hUTB1 from AB individuals was detected with both mAbs anti-A or anti-B (Fig.3). In contrast, hUT-B1 prepared from group O individuals were unreactive with anti-A or anti-B antibodies (Fig. 3). As a control, all preparations, except that prepared from a Jknull individual, gave a strong signal with the affinity-purified anti-Cter antibody to hUT-B1. Altogether, these results clearly demonstrated that the hUT-B1 polypeptide carries Jk blood group antigens, and in addition, exhibits ABO antigens attached to the N-glycan at Asn-211 (Fig. 1). To provide experimental evidence that the N and C terminus of hUT-B1 are intracytoplasmic, immunoadsorption assays of anti-Nter or anti-Cter antibodies"

Adult mGPD knockout animals had a normal cold tolerance, normal circadian rhythm in body temperature, and demonstrated a normal temperature increase in response to thyroid hormone. However, they were found to have a lower body mass index, a 40% reduction in the weight of white adipose tissue, and a slightly lower fasting blood glucose than controls. The phenotype may be secondary to consequences of the obligatory production of cytosolic NADH from glycerol metabolism in the mGPD knockout animal.

In mice the mitochondrial enzyme is encoded by a single gene, Gdm1, on chromosome 2 (1Koza R.A. Kozak U.C. Brown L.J. Leiter E.H. MacDonald M.J. Kozak L.P. Arch. Biochem.

Biophys. 2000; 384: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), presumably by using the dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyl transferase pathway for lipid synthesis. The findings suggest that a lack of cGPD alters the cellular redox status in muscle, whereas pancreatic islet function is relatively normal and liver is only mildly affected, confirming the ability of alternate shuttle mechanisms to reoxidize NADH in some tissues. Because mGPD enzyme levels are high in brown adipose tissue and are elevated by cold treatment (1Koza R.A. Kozak U.C. Brown L.J. Leiter E.H. MacDonald M.J. Kozak L.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and because mGPD is increased in liver and other tissues by thyroid hormone and thermogenic “ergosteroids” (8Lee Y.-P. Lardy H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1427-1436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lardy H., Su, C.-Y. Kneer N. Wielgus S. Lardy H. Stratman F. Hormones, Thermogenesis and Obesity. Elsevier, New York1989: 415-426Google Scholar), mGPD and the glycerol phosphate shuttle have been implicated in thermogenesis. Because the mitochondrial enzyme levels are very high in the pancreatic islet (10MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8287-8290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and are reduced in rodent (11Giroix M.-H. Rasschaert J. Bailbe D. Leclercq-Meyer V. Sener A. Portha B. Malaisse W.J.

Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) diabetes, the shuttle was also proposed to be important for maintenance of islet redox status during glycolysis. Recent studies on an mGPD knockout mouse (14Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Yamauchi N. Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Kasai H. Yazaki Y.

We confirmed this finding with our mGPD knockout mouse and now report the effects of this mutation on mouse growth, reproduction, thermogenesis, and glycerol metabolism. A 129X1/SvJ mouse genomic library in Lambda Fix II was screened with a probe containing the conserved FAD-binding region of the mGPD cDNA (exons 3 and 4) (1Koza R.A. Kozak U.C. Brown L.J. Leiter E.H. MacDonald M.J. Kozak L.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,16Brown L.J. MacDonald M.J. Lehn D.A. Moran S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14363-14366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic clones were sequenced and shown to contain exons 4, 5, and 6 of Gdm1 (Fig. 1A). A targeting vector was designed to delete exons 5 and 6, with the insertion of aNeomycin gene. This deletion also creates a frameshift mutation, leading to premature termination of translation in exon 7. Vector DNA was introduced into the RW-4 line of embryonic stem cells (Genome Systems Inc., St. Louis, MO) and selected for neomycin resistance. Resistant cells were screened for the presence of homologous recombination (probe A, Fig. 1, A andB) and absence of multiple insertion sites (probes B and C, data not shown). Targeted cells were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts at the University of Wisconsin Transgenic Animal Facility. Chimeric animals were mated to C57BL/6J females (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). DNA was prepared from tail snips (17Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar) and screened with a three-primer PCR (Fig.1C) with 30 cycles of 20 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, and 40 s at 72 °C. Primers used were intron 4 forward (InF): 5′-cgtttctcttcagcatccgtga-3′, exon 5 reverse (E5R): 5′-gaagggcttctttcaccatcct-3′, and Neomycinreverse (NeoR): 5′-ttcctgactaggggaggagtagaag-3′. The normal allele gives a 673-bp product and the targeted allele a 269-bp product. Heterozygous mice (F1 and F2) were crossed to produce F2 and F3 mice that were wild (+/+), heterozygous (o/+), or homozygous (o/o) for the exon 5/6 deletion on a mixed (C57BL/6J and 129X1/SvJ) genetic background. Heterozygous F1 or F2 mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6J mice, and progeny were typed for mGPD status. Heterozygous mice were further tested for chromosome 2 markers linked to mGPD (at 33 centimorgans), and selected to minimize the contribution of 129X1/SvJ. Genotyping of markers on chromosome 2 was performed using mouse MapPairs (Research Genetics, Inc., Huntsville, AL) to detect polymorphisms at D2Mit312 (1 centimorgan), D2Mit296 (18 centimorgans), D2Mit237 (28 centimorgans), D2Mit9 (37 centimorgans), D2Mit37 (45 centimorgans), D2Mit274 (52.5 centimorgans), and D2Mit285 (86 centimorgans), according to methods provided. Locations of markers are from the Mouse Genome Data base. 2Mouse Genome Database, Mouse Genome Informatics Web Site, The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, www.informatics.jax.org, May 2002. Mice were visually typed for the Agouti locus (89 centimorgans). At the N5 generation of backcrossing the markers outside D2Mit237–D2Mit37 were homozygous for the C57BL/6J alleles. mGPD o/+ mice were intercrossed to produce o/o (knockout) and +/+ strains (control) that were then maintained separately. Additional backcrossing was performed to generate N6 and N7 mice. F1 and F2 mice were fed a standard diet (Teklad 8604, 4% fat), or placed on a high fat diet (TD96240, 15% fat, Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) at the time of weaning. Mice on the C57BL/6J background were maintained on breeder chow (Teklad 8626, 10% fat). Enzymes and metabolites were measured with standard spectrophotometric or fluorometric assays (19Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis, Third Edition. VCH Publishers, Deerfield Beach, FL1985Google Scholar, 20Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis: A Practical Guide. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993Crossref Google Scholar). Glucose was measured using a One-Touch Profile instrument (Lifescan, Milpitas, CA). Free fatty acids were measured using the Free fatty acids, Half-micro test kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Acetoacetic acid was assessed semi-quantitatively on 6–10 μl of urine using Ketostix (Bayer Corp.) according to directions. Livers and blood were obtained following decapitation of pups, and livers were immediately homogenized in 4–9 volumes of 6% perchloric acid. A comparison with standard freeze clamping showed no difference in metabolite levels compared with direct homogenization of these small organs. Urine was collected by postmortem aspiration from the bladder using an insulin syringe. Total RNA was prepared from interscapular fat pads of 4- to 7-day-old animals using TRI-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed using the ABI Prism 7700 system and UCP1 primers as described previously (21Koza R.A. Hohmann S.M. Guerra C. Rossmeisl M. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34486-34492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Animals were on the C57BL/6J background at the N5 generation. Studies were conducted as described elsewhere (22Gavrilova O. Leon L.R. Marcus-Samuels B. Mason M.M. Castle A.L. Refetoff S. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14623-14628Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Briefly, core body temperature was continuously monitored in conscious, unrestrained animals using an intra-abdominal temperature-sensitive transmitter (Vital-View System, Mini-Mitter, Sunriver, OR). Oxygen consumption was measured using a four-chamber Oxymax system (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH), and motor activity was determined by IR beam interruption (Opto-Varimax mini, Columbus Instruments). All experiments were performed using a single set of mice (12 wild-type, 12 mGPD o/o) on the C57BL/6J background, at the N5 generation. Liver mitochondria from mGPD knockout animals demonstrated loss of mGPD activity (data not shown). Because mitochondria from brown adipose tissue have the highest level of mGPD activity found in the mouse (250 times that in the liver) (1Koza R.A. Kozak U.C. Brown L.J. Leiter E.H. MacDonald M.J. Kozak L.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), this tissue was used to confirm the complete loss of mGPD activity. BAT mitochondria from 6- to 9-week-old control animals (N7) showed mGPD activity twice that of their mGPD o/+ littermates (627 ± 38 nmol of product/min/mg of protein in mGPD +/+ versus 314 ± 22 in mGPD o/+, n = 5 each group, mean ± S.E.,p < 0.001 by Student’s t test). Protein blots demonstrated reduced levels of mGPD protein in heterozygous animals and no detectable mGPD protein in o/o animals (Fig.2A). Enzyme assays on these same samples confirmed that enzyme activity correlated with protein quantity (Fig. 2B). In initial crosses between heterozygous animals of a mixed 129X1/SvJ × C57BL/6J genetic background, homozygous knockout animals appeared at the expected frequency (TableI). After five to seven generations of backcrosses to C57BL/6J, the frequency of o/o animals in the o/+ intercrosses dropped to 14% (36/254), consistent with a viability of only 50% at the time of weaning. At the N5 and N6 backcross generation, fertility was also reduced proportionately with the number of knockout alleles in the cross, and survival of pups to weaning was similarly reduced. The number of pups weaned per litter in the [o/o × o/o] cross was less than half of that in the control [+/+ × +/+] cross (Table II).Table IViability of mGPD knockout mice on different genetic backgroundsBackgroundmGPD genotypeProbability+/++/oo/o129 × B6 F2, F399 (105.75)224 (211.5)100 (105.75)p = 0.47C57BL/6 N5-N779 (63.5)139 (127)36 (63.5)p = 0.0002F1 and F2 mice heterozygous for the mGPD deletion were intercrossed to generate F2 and F3 mice for testing.

Comparisons of observed with expected numbers were performed using the Chi Square test.

Two males and two females each of adult F2 +/+ and o/o genotypes were examined histologically. Tissues examined included lung, trachea, esophagus, thyroid, heart, spleen, skeletal muscle, skin, liver, kidney, stomach, duodenum, pancreas, adrenal, ovary, testis, uterus, small intestine, colon, mesenteric lymph node, brain, interscapular fat pad, mesometrial fat, epididymal fat, bone (femur), and bone marrow of both sexes. No consistent abnormalities were found in any tissue. Fig.3A shows the growth of mGPD +/+, o/+, and o/o mice on a mixed genetic background. Two diets, containing 4 and 15% fat, were used. Male mice heterozygous or homozygous for the knockout weighed less than control animals when fed the low fat diet, but only the homozygous knockout animals differed significantly from controls in the high fat diet group. Although similar trends were seen in females, differences did not reach statistical significance. On the 4% fat diet o/o males weighed 28% less than +/+ males at 4–6 months of age. Fig. 3B shows the effects of the mGPD deletion when bred onto a C57BL/6J background. All animals were from the N5 or N6 generation and were maintained on a 10% fat breeder chow. Variability in this group was less than that seen with the genetically mixed background mice, and weight differences were seen in both the male and female o/o animals when compared with control animals. When weaned at 21 days, o/o males on a C57BL/6J background were 23% smaller and females were 16% smaller than +/+ animals (Table II). These differences could be due to maternal factors, however, in crosses of +/+ with o/o animals, o/+ pups delivered and nursed by o/o females did not differ in size at 20 days from those delivered and nursed by +/+ females (Table II). This suggests that size differences are due to effects of the pup genotype, rather than milk quality or maternal behavior. Table III shows that weight differences persisted in older animals, averaging 27% in males and 14% in females by 9–11 months. Body mass index reflected the weight difference, because there was little difference in body length. The white adipose tissue of the epididymal fat pads of males and parametrial fat pads of females was more severely affected, with an ∼40% lower weight seen in knockout animals of both sexes compared with controls.Table IIIDecreased weight and adiposity in mGPD o/o mice versus +/+ controlsGroupBody weightLengthBody mass indexWATngcmg/cm2gMales +/+45.3 ± 1.011.2 ± 0.050.36 ± 0.0072.20 ± 0.0717Males o/o33.1 ± 1.33-ap = 0.0001.

Weight of white adipose tissue (WAT) was determined on the epididymal fat pads of males and parametrial fat pads of females. Analysis of variance was used to compare +/+ and o/o mice. Numbers in parentheses show o/o values as a percentage of +/+ controls. Use of the cytosolic GPD for conversion of glycerol phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate produces cytosolic NADH, whereas use of the mitochondrial enzyme for this same reaction does not. Excess NADH would be expected to raise the tissue lactate/pyruvate ratio in the o/o pups. In fact, no such elevation was found in 5- to 7-day-old pups on the C57BL/6J background. Heterozygous (o/+) pups had liver lactate values of 1320 ± 160 nmol/g of liver (±S.E., n = 10), pyruvate values of 51.2 ± 10.3 nmol/g of liver (n = 9), and a lactate/pyruvate ratio of 25.8, whereas o/o pups had lactate values of 840 ± 90 nmol/g of liver (n = 5), pyruvate values of 56.9 ± 20 nmol/g of liver (n = 8), and a lactate/pyruvate ratio of 14.8. We examined whether alterations in glycerol metabolism might affect free fatty acids or ketone levels in nursing pups. No differences were seen between knockout and control pups in 5- to 7-day-old animals on the C57BL/6J background. Knockout pups had plasma free fatty acids of 0.38 ± 0.03 mmversus 0.39 ± 0.03 (mean ± S.E.) for the +/+ controls (n = 5 for both groups). All animals were negative (<5 mg/dl) when tested for urine acetoacetic acid. Additional metabolic studies were done on livers and blood from 14- to 18-day-old nursing pups (Table IV). Liver ATP was reduced in the o/o pups to 78% of the +/+ control. Liver glycerol 3-phosphate values were 138% of controls. Blood glucose values showed a trend to lower values in the knockouts but did not reach statistical significance.Table IVMetabolites in nursing pupsmGPD +/+mGPD o/o (%4-cPercentage of mGPD +/+.)p valueLiver ATP4-anmoles/mg protein.9.8 ± 0.57.6 ± 0.3 (78)0.0006Liver G3P4-anmoles/mg protein.4.2 ± 0.45.8 ± 0.6 (138)0.05Blood glucose4-bmg/dl.125 ± 3112 ± 5 (90)0.07n910Nursing pups on the C57BL/6J background (N5) were tested at 14–18 days of age.

Results show mean ± S.E., values were compared by analysis of variance. Blood glucose values were also tested after 18 h fasts in adult mice on the mixed genetic background, on both a 4% and a 15% fat diet. On both these diets calories are derived primarily from carbohydrates, however, glycogen should be depleted after 18 h and blood glucose values should reflect gluconeogenesis. Differences in blood glucose were seen only in the male mice (Fig.4), but appeared to decrease with age, at least in the high fat diet mice. Differences in blood glucose were also seen in adult male mice on the C57BL/6J background (TableV). However, in these mice body weight also demonstrated a correlation with blood glucose level (p = 0.01). If adjusted for weight, genotype was no longer associated with glucose level (p = 0.64), suggesting that blood glucose differences might be secondary to differences in adiposity.Table VFasting blood glucose in mice on the C57BL/6J backgroundmGPD +/+mGPD o/opvalue5-ap values shown are for blood glucose comparisons between +/+ and o/o animals.Weight, males34.9 ± 1.328.5 ± 1.20.007Glucose, males78.6 ± 6.958.7 ± 2.70.002/0.645-bWhen glucose values in males were adjusted for weight the p value became 0.64.

Metabolites measured in liver and muscle of adult F2 or F3 animals included glycerol phosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, fructose bisphosphate, lactate, pyruvate, malate, aspartate, ATP, ADP, and AMP. No consistent differences were seen between o/o and +/+ animals in any of these (data not shown). In mouse pups tested at 4–7 days of age, we found no evidence for compensatory changes in UCP1 due to loss of mGPD. Levels of UCP1 mRNA did not differ significantly between wild-type controls and mGPD o/o pups: mGPD +/+, 9040 ± 259 arbitrary units/ng of total RNA; mGPD o/o, 7304 ± 892 arbitrary units/ng (mean ± S.E., n = 5 animals in each group). Adult mGPD o/o mice demonstrated a normal circadian rhythm in body temperature, which was not significantly different from that of controls, although there was a trend toward a slightly lower temperature in the knockout animals (TableVI, A). With administration of tri-iodothyronine (T3, 0.1 or 1 mg/kg intraperitoneally) mGPD o/o mice had a normal increase in body temperature and oxygen consumption. (Table VI, B, 0.1 mg/kg data not shown). The mGPD o/o mice showed a tendency toward a higher metabolic rate, as determined by oxygen consumption, both under basal conditions and after T3, but this did not reach statistical significance. The respiratory exchange ratio did not differ from that of control animals.Table VIThermogenesis in mGPD knockout mice mGPD +/+ mGPD o/op valueA) Temperature, day (°C)36.11 ± 0.06 (8)35.97 ± 0.04 (9)0.07Temperature, night36.68 ± 0.08 (8)36.50 ± 0.08 (9)NSB) Temperature, control35.76 ± 0.17 (6)35.63 ± 0.22 (5)NSTemperature, +T336.19 ± 0.09 (6)36.08 ± 0.17 (6)NSO2 consumption, control8.13 ± 0.27 (6)9.60 ± 0.82 (5)NSO2consumption, +T310.80 ± 0.74 (6)6-ap = 0.007.12.48 ± 0.25 (6)6-ap = 0.007.0.06RER, control0.90 ± 0.02 (6)0.94 ± 0.02 (5)NSRER, +T30.90 ± 0.02 (6)0.92 ± 0.02 (6)NSActivity, control241 ± 21 (6)265 ± 52 (5)NSActivity, +T3272 ± 27 (6)385 ± 68 (6)NSC) Temperature, baseline35.95 ± 0.07 (12)36.05 ± 0.12 (11)NS6-cp value from a post-hoc Tukey test.Temperature, cage switch36.78 ± 0.12 (12)6-bp = 0.001.36.43 ± 0.18 (11)6-bp = 0.001.0.0526-cp value from a post-hoc Tukey test.Activity, baseline6.5 ± 0.8 (12)6.3 ± 1.1 (11)NS6-cp value from a post-hoc Tukey test.Activity, cage switch25.7 ± 1.9 (12)6-bp = 0.001.17.9 ± 3.4 (11)6-bp = 0.001.0.0096-cp value from a post-hoc Tukey test.D) Body weight (g)32.1 ± 0.7 (12)28.6 ± 0.5 (12)0.0003Food intake (g/day)4.05 ± 0.21 (12)3.89 ± 0.10 (12)NSFood (g/day/bw0.75)0.30 ± 0.02 (12)0.32 ± 0.01 (12)NSA) 12-h day (light) and night (dark) body temperature averages were compared by Student’s t test.

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-associated myelopathy arise in a minority (2–5%) of HTLV-1-infected subjects after a latency period of years to decades. Although HTLV-1 was the first retrovirus demonstrated to cause neoplasia in humans, a number of aspects of its life cycle and pathogenic properties are still poorly understood (for recent reviews of HTLV-1, see Refs. 1Johnson J.M.

Martin M.A. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia2001: 1941-1969Google Scholar). The viral transcriptional regulator Tax is known to play a critical role in HTLV-1-associated cell immortalization through its ability to deregulate the expression of a vast array of cellular genes and interfere with cell cycle checkpoints. Although it is well established that HTLV-1 is oncogenic in vitro, neoplastic transformation of primary human lymphocytes cannot be attained by transducing Tax alone, suggesting that other viral (and host) determinants are also required for the emergence of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Furthermore, the low prevalence and long latency of leukemia in HTLV-1-infected individuals suggest the existence of mechanisms holding the oncogenic potential of the virus at bay, resulting in efficient adaptation to the host. Even less is known regarding the pathogenesis of tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-associated myelopathy, although a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-mediated autoimmune mechanism has been postulated. To gain further insight into the mechanisms governing HTLV-1 replication and pathogenesis, a number of studies are currently focusing on recently described “accessory” proteins encoded in ORFs x-I and x-II, which are located in a 3′ portion of the viral genome termed the X region (3Berneman Z.N.

In addition, cell-mediated immune responses against these gene products have been demonstrated in infected individuals (12Pique C. Ureta-Vidal A. Gessain A. Chancerel B. Gout O. Tamouza R. Agis F. Dokhelar M.-C. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), thus providing strong evidence that these proteins are expressed during the natural history of HTLV-1 infection. We demonstrated that one of the gene products of the x-II ORF, named p13II, is selectively targeted to mitochondria. Expression of p13II results in specific alterations in mitochondrial morphology and distribution from an extensively interconnected network of string-like structures to clusters of spheroid bodies, suggesting that p13II might interfere with mitochondrial functionin situ (13Ciminale V.

This observation along with the findings that the p13II-coding sequence is conserved among HTLV-1 isolates, that its mRNA is expressed during HTLV-1 infection and disease (5Koralnik I.J. Gessain A.

Med. 2000; 191: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) indicate that the protein might exert a significant biological role in viral replication and/or pathogenesis. The present study was undertaken to unravel the function of p13II through (i) determination of its submitochondrial localization and sequences required to induce the alterations in mitochondrial morphology and (ii) an assessment of the biophysical and biological properties of a set of synthetic peptides spanning residues 9–41, which include the amphipathic MTS of the protein. Results demonstrated the functional importance of a cluster of MTS arginines and indicated that the protein accumulates in the inner mitochondrial membrane. On the basis of observations made with the synthetic peptides, we propose that p13II increases mitochondrial permeability to small cations (e.g.Ca2+, Na+, and K+), causing swelling of the organelle and depolarization. Peptides were synthesized by solid phase methods and 9-fluorenilmethoxycarbonyl chemistry (15Fields G.B. Noble R.L. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 3: 161-214Google Scholar) using an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) model 431 A peptide synthesizer (improved in our laboratories as described in Marin et al. (16Marin O. Meggio F. Sarno S. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7192-7198Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After cleavage with trifluoroacetic acid, the peptides were purified to homogeneity by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography on a Waters (Milford, MA) prepNova-Pak HR C18 column with a linear gradient of 10–45% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 12 ml/min. Peptide molecular weights were confirmed by mass spectroscopy using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight spectrometer (Maldi-1; Kratos-Shimadzu, Manchester, England). CD spectra were recorded with a Jasco (Easton, MD) J-170 spectropolarimeter. The instrument was calibrated with d-(+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid. Far-UV CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C at a peptide concentration of 15 μm in buffers specified in the legend to Fig. 2 using 0.1-cm path length quartz cells. The mean residue ellipticity [Θ] (deg·cm2·dmol−1) was calculated from the formula [Θ]MRW = (Θobs/10)MRW/lc), where Θobs is the observed ellipticity at a given wavelength, MRW is the mean residue weight of the peptide(s), l is the cuvette path length in cm, and c is the peptide concentration in g/ml. Lipid vesicles were prepared from dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol in trichloromethane. After evaporating the organic solvent under an argon stream, the dried lipid was dissolved in Tris/HCl buffer to obtain a final lipid concentration of 1.7 mm and sonicated for about 15 min until the solution became transparent. The p13II ORF was obtained from HTLV-1 molecular clone pCS-HTLV-1 (17Derse D. Mikovits L. Polianova M. Felber B.K. Ruscetti F. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1907-1912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned into vector pSG5 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), resulting in plasmid pSGp13II. Mutations in the p13II ORF were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange kit, Stratagene) and verified by cycle sequencing (fmol kit, Promega, Madison, WI). PCR amplifications were carried out using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in a GeneAmp 9600 thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen. Plasmids were purified by chromatography (Jetstar kit, Genomed, Bad Oeynhausen, Germany) and transfected into HeLa cells or the HeLa-derived cell line Hltat (Ref.18Schwartz S. Felber B.K. Benko D. Mfenyo E.M. Pavlakis G.N. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2519-2529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; used due to their high transfection efficiency) by calcium phosphate coprecipitation. Crude preparations of mitochondria were obtained from Hltat cells as follows. One day after transfection with pSGp13II, cells were scraped into PBS, pelleted, and then resuspended in a mitochondrial isolation buffer consisting of 300 mm sucrose, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 4 mmKH2PO4 (19Petit P.X. O'Connor J.E. Grunwald D. Brown S.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) with 200 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml leupeptin added as protease inhibitors. The suspension was passed 10 times through a 26-gauge needle and centrifuged 2 times at 625 × g for 10 min in a swinging bucket rotor to remove intact cells and large debris. The clarified supernatant was centrifuged at 17,500 ×g for 15 min; the resulting pellets containing mitochondria were resuspended in mitochondrial isolation buffer and recentrifuged. For Triton X-114 fractionation assays, mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% Triton X-114 and processed as described by Bordier (20Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the exception that all volumes were reduced by one-half; supernatants and pellets were solubilized and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting. Sodium carbonate extraction (21Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar) was performed as follows. Washed mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in 100 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, and incubated on ice for 30 min. The alkaline mixture was then combined with enough 2.5m sucrose prepared in 100 mm sodium carbonate to yield a final sucrose concentration of 1.6 m. This suspension was placed in an ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with 1.25m sucrose, 100 mm sodium carbonate followed by a layer of 250 mm sucrose, 100 mm sodium carbonate and centrifuged at 47,000 rpm for 2 h in an SW60.1 rotor (Beckman Instruments). The step gradient was collected in 2 fractions, the 0.25–1.25 m sucrose interface plus the 1.25m sucrose layer, containing membrane-integrated proteins, and the 1.6 m sucrose layer, containing proteins not inserted into membranes. The fractions were diluted with water to reduce the sucrose concentration to 500 mm, and proteins were precipitated with 12% trichloroacetic acid, solubilized, and separated by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting. Digitonin fractionation assays were performed by resuspending mitochondria in a sucrose-based solution (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 200 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) with or without 0.5% digitonin; after incubation for 1 min on ice the suspensions were centrifuged at 17,500 × g for 15 min, and resulting supernatants and pellets were solubilized and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting. Solubilized proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (15% total; 37.5:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) along with a prestained protein marker (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) and then transferred to nitrocellulose (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany). Blots were cut just above the 25-kDa marker; the top half was incubated with a mixture of goat anti-Hsp 60 (Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany), mouse anti-Cox I (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands), and mouse anti-Porin (Calbiochem), and the bottom half was incubated with a rabbit serum raised against the carboxyl terminus of the x-II ORF (rabbit anti-Tof; 4). After incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz or Amersham Biosciences), the blots were developed using chemiluminescence detection reagents (Supersignal kit, Pierce) and exposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). For conventional electron microscopy, p13II-expressing Hltat cells were washed three times in PBS, pH 7.4, and fixed with PBS, 2% glutaraldehyde for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in Veronal acetate buffer, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 25 °C, stained with 0.1% tannic acid in the same buffer for 30 min at 25 °C and with uranyl acetate (5 mg/ml) for 1 h at 25 °C, dehydrated in acetone, and embedded in Epon 812. Thin sections were examined unstained or poststained with uranyl acetate and lead hydroxide. For immunoelectron microscopy, cells were fixed with a mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde prepared in 100 mm phosphate buffer for 2 h at 25 °C, washed, placed in 100 mmphosphate buffer containing 12% gelatin (Sigma), and solidified on ice. Gelatin blocks were infused with 2.3 m sucrose overnight at 4 °C, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and cryo-sectioned. Ultrathin cryo-sections were collected with sucrose and methyl cellulose and incubated with rabbit anti-Tof antibody diluted 1:10 in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin. After several washes in PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, the sections were incubated with 10-nm diameter colloidal gold particles conjugated with goat-anti rabbit IgG (British BioCell International, Cardiff, UK) diluted 1:20 in PBS. Control experiments were performed by omission of the primary antibody from the labeling procedure. After incubation with the antibodies, the cryo-sections were stained with a solution of 2% methyl cellulose and 0.4% uranyl acetate and examined by electron microscopy. Liver mitochondria isolated from albino Wistar rats weighing about 300 g were prepared by standard centrifugation techniques as described previously (22Costantini P. Petronilli V. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Toxicology. 1995; 99: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Measurements of mitochondrial volume, membrane potential, and Ca2+ transport were carried out with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 650–40 spectrofluorimeter equipped with magnetic stirring and thermostatic control. Mitochondrial volume was measured as the change in 90 ° light scattering at 540 nm (23Hunter D.R. Haworth R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 24Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane potential and changes in extramitochondrial [Ca2+] were assayed by measuring the change in fluorescence intensity of rhodamine 123 (25Emaus R.K. Grunwald R. Lemasters J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) and calcium Green-5N (26Fontaine E. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25734-25740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), respectively. Both probes were excited at 503 nm (2 nm slit), whereas emission was analyzed at 525 nm for rhodamine 123 and at 535 nm for calcium Green-5N, with the slit set at 5 nm in both cases. Details of assay conditions are provided in the legends to Figs. 5 and 6.Figure 6Effects of p13II peptides on membrane potential and Ca2+ fluxes in isolated mitochondria.Panel A, the experimental conditions were as in Fig. 5, panel A, but the medium was supplemented with 0.1 μm rhodamine 123. One milligram of rat liver mitochondria (RLM) was added followed by 1 μm wild-type p139–41 peptide (trace a); in trace b, the mitochondria were treated with 5 μmp139–41Q or p139–41P peptide followed by 200 μm DNP. Values on the ordinate refer to changes in rhodamine 123 fluorescence. In panel B, assays were performed at 25 °C in a 2-ml final volume containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-MOPS, 1 mmPi-Tris, 2 μg/ml CsA, 5 mm succinate-Tris, 2 μm rotenone, and 1 μm calcium Green-5N. The following additions (indicated by arrows) were made: 1 mg rat liver mitochondria (RLM), 10 μmCa2+, 0.2 μm ruthenium red (RR), 1 μm wild-type p139–41 peptide (trace a), 0.2 mm DNP (trace b) followed by 1 μm wild-type p139–41 peptide (last addition).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 24–36 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) that had been prewarmed to 37 °C, fixed for 20 min with 3.7% formaldehyde in DMEM, permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Nonidet P40/PBS, and then incubated with the antibodies specified in the legend to Fig. 7. Signals were analyzed by confocal microscopy using a LSM510 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with argon (488 nm) and helium-neon (543 nm) laser sources and a 63× oil immersion objective; 0.9-μm optical slices were examined. Fig. 1A shows the 87-amino acid sequence of p13II, with its 10-amino acid MTS underlined. The PHDSec structure prediction program (27Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 9: 55-72Crossref Scopus (1337) Google Scholar) suggests that the amino-terminal portion of the protein contains a short hydrophobic leader (amino acids 1–5) followed by an α-helix (amino acids 21–30) that includes the MTS (13Ciminale V. Zotti L. D'Agostino D.M. Ferro T. Casareto L. Franchini G. Bernardi P. Chieco-Bianchi L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4505-4515Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The latter region includes 4 arginine residues at positions 22, 25, 29, and 30, which are predicted to form a positively charged patch within the putative α-helix, thereby imparting amphipathic properties to this region (Fig.1B; Ref. 13Ciminale V. Zotti L. D'Agostino D.M. Ferro T. Casareto L. Franchini G. Bernardi P. Chieco-Bianchi L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4505-4515Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To directly verify these predictions, we generated synthetic peptides that included the p13II MTS and examined their structure by CD. Results showed that p139–41 (a peptide spanning amino acids 9–41 of wild-type p13II) failed to fold into an ordered structure when placed in an aqueous solution; in particular, the ellipticity minima at 208 and 222 nm that are characteristic of an α helix were not detected under these conditions (Fig.2A). Although the CD spectrum of the peptide changed when recorded in the organic solvent trifluoroethanol, utilized to promote the formation of an α-helical structure, the resulting conformation was predominantly unstructured. In contrast, the spectrum was dominated by the characteristic minima at 208 and 222 nm in the presence of 10 mm SDS, a concentration exceeding the critical micelle concentration, i.e. 0.8 mm under the assay conditions employed. The peptide also adopted an α-helical conformation when SDS was replaced with phospholipid vesicles, indicating that the MTS region is able to fold into an α helix only when exposed to a membrane-like environment. Fig. 2B shows the influence of the SDS concentration on the CD spectrum of peptide p139–41. Formation of an α helix became evident at an SDS concentration of 0.8 mm, i.e. the critical micelle concentration; the ellipticity minima were most pronounced at 1 mm SDS. As a prelude to subsequent functional studies, we next investigated the folding properties of peptides spanning residues 9–41 in which the 4 arginine residues at positions 22, 25, 29, and 30 were substituted with either 4 glutamines, alanine-leucine-leucine-alanine, or 4 prolines, resulting in peptides p139–41Q, AL, and P, respectively. While the glutamine and alanine-leucine substitution mutants were predicted to retain α helical folding, with just its positively charged face replaced with an uncharged polar cluster (mutant Q) or hydrophobic residues (mutant AL), the proline substitutions were predicted to disrupt the formation of an α helix. As shown in Fig. 2C, the spectra of peptides p139–41Q and p139–41AL exhibited minima at 208 and 222 nm in the presence of 10 mm SDS, indicating the formation of an α helix. In contrast, the p139–41P peptide failed to adopt an α-helical conformation. The finding that peptide p139–41 folded into an α helix when placed in a membrane-like environment prompted us to determine whether p13II is membrane-associated in the context of mitochondria. For this purpose, mitochondria isolated from human cells expressing the full-length p13II protein were extracted with Triton-X-114. This detergent is soluble in aqueous solutions at low temperatures but separates into aqueous and detergent phases above 20°C (20Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial proteins partitioned in the aqueous and detergent phases were subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting and the distribution of p13II was compared with that of the soluble mitochondrial matrix protein Hsp 60 and the membrane proteins Porin and CoxI, which are inserted in the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes, respectively. As shown in Fig.3A, Hsp 60 was detected almost exclusively in the aqueous fraction, while Porin, CoxI, and p13II were found mainly in the detergent fraction, suggesting that p13II is likely to be associated with membranes rather than present in a soluble form in the matrix or intermembrane space. To test whether p13II was membrane-inserted, we subjected p13II-containing mitochondria to alkaline extraction with sodium carbonate (21Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar) followed by ultracentrifugation through a sucrose step gradient. Fig. 3B shows immunoblots of the resulting soluble and membrane-bound fractions carried out to detect p13II, along with Hsp 60, CoxI, and Porin. p13II was detected mainly in the membrane-bound fraction along with the majority of CoxI (not evident in this exposure) and Porin, whereas Hsp 60 was detected mainly in the soluble fraction. Having obtained evidence that the majority of p13II is membrane-associated, we next determined whether the protein accumulates in the outer or inner membrane on the basis of its sensitivity to extraction by digitonin under isotonic conditions. As shown in Fig.3C, this treatment resulted in partial extraction of the outer membrane protein Porin; in contrast, neither the inner membrane protein CoxI nor p13II was extracted, thus providing evidence that p13II resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The immunoblots shown in Fig. 3 also revealed the presence of a p13II-related band of about 25 kDa (denoted by anasterisk) of unknown significance (see “Discussion”). To directly visualize the submitochondrial distribution of p13II and to examine its effect on mitochondrial morphology in more detail, electron microscopy was carried out on p13II-transfected human cells (Fig.4). Immunogold labeling to detect p13II (Fig. 4, panels A–E) revealed accumulation of gold particles inside mitochondria, mainly associated with the inner membrane and cristae. This observation supported the results obtained with the biochemical fractionation assays and indicated that the protein accumulates in the inner membrane. Ultrastructural examination of p13II-transfected cells revealed cells displaying different levels of morphological changes in their mitochondria (Fig. 4, panels F and G). Although some cells contained apparently unaltered mitochondria, others contained mitochondria showing fragmentation of the cristae and swelling, varying from slight disruption (see mitochondrion labeledM1) to substantial or almost complete loss of internal structures (mitochondria labeled M2 and M, respectively). Interestingly, mitochondria exhibiting more prominent alterations often appeared in close proximity to endoplasmic reticulum cisternae (see arrows and mitochondria labeled Min panel G). Although we could not positively identify p13II-expressing cells in this analysis, the percentage of cells showing altered mitochondria was consistent with the percentage of p13II-expressing cells determined by indirect immunofluorescence carried out on an aliquot of the transfected cells (results not shown), thus suggesting an association between p13II expression and the observed ultrastructural changes. The appearance of the altered mitochondria visualized by indirect immunofluorescence (13Ciminale V. Zotti L. D'Agostino D.M. Ferro T. Casareto L. Franchini G. Bernardi P. Chieco-Bianchi L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4505-4515Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and electron microscopy (Fig. 4, panels F and G) was suggestive of swelling, a phenomenon that arises from altered permeability of mitochondria to osmotically active species (for review, see Ref. 28Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). This observation prompted us to assay the effects of the synthetic p13II peptides described above on isolated mitochondria. In the experiments reported in Fig.5, panel A, rat liver mitochondria energized with succinate were incubated in isotonic KCl, and the 90 ° light scattering of the suspension at 540 nm was monitored. The addition of 1 μm wild-type p139–41 peptide (Fig. 5, panel A, trace a) caused a rapid decrease in light scattering, which is indicative of mitochondrial swelling. After reaching a minimum level of light scattering, mitochondria underwent a partial recovery, and the signal eventually stabilized to an intermediate level. These volume oscillations, which were somewhat variable in extent among different mitochondrial preparations, are typical of the mitochondrial response to cation uptake through a channel, the contraction phase being due to transie"
https://openalex.org/W2038291084,"Light-harvesting complexes (LHC) of higher plants are composed of at least 10 different proteins. Despite their pronounced amino acid sequence homology, the LHC of photosystem II show differences in pigment binding that are interpreted in terms of partly different functions. By contrast, there is only scarce knowledge about the pigment composition of LHC of photosystem I, and consequently no concept of potentially different functions of the various LHCI exists. For better insight into this issue, we isolated native LHCI-730 and LHCI-680. Pigment analyses revealed that LHCI-730 binds more chlorophyll and violaxanthin than LHCI-680. For the first time all LHCI complexes are now available in their recombinant form; their analysis allowed further dissection of pigment binding by individual LHCI proteins and analysis of pigment requirements for LHCI formation. By these different approaches a correlation between the requirement of a single chlorophyll species for LHC formation and the chlorophylla/b ratio of LHCs could be detected, and indications regarding occupation of carotenoid-binding sites were obtained. Additionally the reconstitution approach allowed assignment of spectral features observed in native LHCI-680 to its components Lhca2 and Lhca3. It is suggested that excitation energy migrates from chlorophyll(s) fluorescing at 680 (Lhca3) via those fluorescing at 686/702 nm (Lhca2) or 720 nm (Lhca3) to the photosystem I core chlorophylls.

LHC are composed of a protein moiety to which Chls and carotenoids are noncovalently attached. In higher plants 10 distinct light-harvesting apoproteins (Lhc) can be distinguished. Four of them are exclusively associated with photosystem (PS) I (Lhca1–4), another four with PS II (Lhcb3–6) and two (Lhcb1 and 2) are preferentially but not exclusively associated with PS II (1Jansson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 2Scheller H.V. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Lunde C. Knoetzel J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 41-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Up to now there is only limited insight in distinct functions apart from light harvesting of the various LHC. A proportion of LHCIIb (composed of Lhcb1 and 2) is involved in redistribution of excitation energy between PS II and PS I by state transitions that occur upon selective overexcitation of one PS (3Allen J.F. Forsberg J. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 317-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). CP29 (Lhcb4), CP26 (Lhcb5), and CP24 (Lhcb6) have particularly high contents of violaxanthin (vio) that can be converted to zeaxanthin, which may exert a special role in regulation of light harvesting as revealed by nonphotochemical quenching (4Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters RG Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 655-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was suggested that these LHCs regulate energy transmittance to the PS II core (5Yamamoto H.Y. Bassi R. Ort D.R. Yokum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1996: 539-563Google Scholar). As a consequence of the interrelation of pigment composition and function in LHCIIs, it is important to have detailed knowledge about the pigment composition of the various LHCs for getting insight into their potentially different functions. During the past decade the pigment composition and spectral properties of LHCs belonging to PS II were studied in great detail (6Peter G.F. Thornber J.P. J. Biol.

These investigations demonstrated that despite the large similarity of the protein sequences of all Lhc proteins (12Pichersky E. Jansson S. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1996: 507-521Google Scholar), differences exist with regard to pigment binding and spectroscopic properties. The LHC studied in the most detail is LHCIIb. Crystallographic data and biochemical characterization of LHCIIb revealed the binding of at least 12 Chls (seven Chl a and five Chl b), approximately two luteins (lut), one neoxanthin (neo), and a substoichiometric amount of vio (6Peter G.F.

By structure analysis, amino acid sequence comparison, and site-specific mutagenesis, nine Chl binding sites, two lut-binding sites (L1 and L2) at helices 1 and 3 (12Pichersky E. Jansson S. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1996: 507-521Google Scholar, 13Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) could be localized. It is still under debate whether the detected vio replaces lut (8Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 11Hobe S. Niemeier H. Bender A. Paulsen H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 616-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or whether there is an additional peripheral vio-binding site (9Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Replacement of one xanthophyll species (e.g. lut) by an other (e.g.vio) could be demonstrated by LHC reconstitution experiments with Lhcb1 (8Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 11Hobe S. Niemeier H. Bender A. Paulsen H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 616-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The pigment composition of the minor Chl-binding proteins of PS II (CP29, CP26, and CP24) differs from that of LHCIIb. They ligate fewer Chls (eight to ten), lut (approximately one), and neo (approximately 0.5) but more vio (one-half to one) and consequently have a lower total carotenoid content than LHCIIb (6Peter G.F. Thornber J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16745-16754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bassi R. Pineau B. Dainese P. Marquardt J. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7334-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an interrelation between the location of the LHC within PS II and its preference for one Chl species exists. CP29 and CP26 located adjacent to the PS II core preferentially bind Chla, whereas the peripheral LHCIIb contains almost equal numbers of Chl a and b (6Peter G.F. Thornber J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16745-16754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bassi R. Pineau B. Dainese P. Marquardt J. Eur. J.

In addition there seems to be a correlation between the Chla/b ratio of a LHC and the requirement for one Chl species for LHC formation. By omission of an individual Chl species in reconstitution mixtures, the requirement of Chl a for CP29 formation (Chl a/b = 3; Ref. 18Giuffra E. Cugini D. Croce R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and of Chl b for formation of CP26 (Chla/b = 2) and LHCIIb (Chla/b = 1.4) could be demonstrated (19Ros F. Bassi R. Paulsen H.

These results mimic very well the situation found in mutants defective in synthesis of Chl b (22White M.J. Green B.R. Photosynth. Res. 1988; 15: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 23Bossmann B. Knoetzel J. Jansson S. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 52: 127-136Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and demonstrate the usefulness of the reconstitution approach for analyzing the structural role of individual pigment species for LHC formation. By contrast, little attention was paid to the pigment composition of LHCI, which is a consequence of its difficult purification. LHCI can be subfractionated into two populations called LHCI-680 and LHCI-730 according to their 77 K (Kelvin) fluorescence emission maximum (24Bassi R. Machold O. Simpson D. Carlsberg Res. Commun. 1985; 50: 145-162Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The former is composed of polypeptides with 23 and 24 kDa (Lhca2 and Lhca3, respectively), and the latter is composed of polypeptides with 21 and 20.5 kDa (Lhca1 and Lhca4, respectively) (25Lam E. Ortiz W. Malkin R. FEBS Lett. 1984; 168: 10-14Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 26Ikeuchi M. Hirano A. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1991; 32: 103-112Google Scholar, 27Knoetzel J. Svendsen I. Simpson D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Use of other detergent mixtures for PS I solubilization in combination with improved separation techniques allowed splitting of LHCI-680 into two different fractions, one enriched in Lhca2 (LHCI-680B) and the other enriched in Lhca3 (LHCI-680A) (26Ikeuchi M. Hirano A. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1991; 32: 103-112Google Scholar, 27Knoetzel J. Svendsen I. Simpson D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Despite this progress in correlating fluorescence properties with individual Lhca polypeptides, analyses of the pigment composition are very limited. There are only detailed analyses about LHCI-730 of barley (28Damm I. Steinmetz D. Grimme L.H. Baltscheffsky M. Current Research in Photosynthesis. II. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1990: 607-610Google Scholar) and tomato (29Schmid V.H.R. Cammarata K.V. Bruns B.U. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7667-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), a maize LHCI holocomplex of unknown polypeptide composition (30Croce R. Bassi R. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. I. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1998: 421-424Google Scholar), and a red algal LHCI (31Grabowski B. Tan S. Cunningham F.X. Gantt E. Photosynth. Res. 2000; 63: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In some studies only Chl a/bratios were determined, which range from 1 to 3 for LHCI-680 and from 2.2 to 3.6 for LHCI-730 (24Bassi R. Machold O. Simpson D. Carlsberg Res. Commun. 1985; 50: 145-162Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 25Lam E. Ortiz W. Malkin R.

Palsson L.O. Andersson B. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 45: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In other reports the values are simply based on calculations of the difference in pigment content of PS I holocomplex versus PS I core complex lacking LHCI (37Siefermann-Harms D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 325-355Crossref Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 38Lee A.I.-C. Thornber J.P. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and deviate strongly from that obtained by HPLC analyses of isolated LHCI(-730), which demonstrated the presence of seven to ten Chls, approximately one lut, and substoichiometric amounts of vio and β-car per Lhca protein (29Schmid V.H.R. Cammarata K.V. Bruns B.U. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7667-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 30Croce R. Bassi R. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. I. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1998: 421-424Google Scholar). This indicates that the pigment composition of LHCI(-730) is similar to that of minor Chl-binding proteins of PS II with the exception that β-car is present and neo is absent (28Damm I. Steinmetz D. Grimme L.H. Baltscheffsky M. Current Research in Photosynthesis. II. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1990: 607-610Google Scholar, 29Schmid V.H.R. Cammarata K.V. Bruns B.U. Schmidt G.W. Proc.

However, there are no analyses about pigment composition of LHCI-680 available yet that allow assessment of common features and differences of the two LHCI subpopulations that would be essential for a better insight into potentially different functions of the various LHCI. This lack extends to the pigment binding properties of individual Lhca proteins with the exception of Lhca1 and Lhca4 (29Schmid V.H.R. Cammarata K.V. Bruns B.U. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Chem. 2002; 106: 4313-4317Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and to studies regarding the significance of individual pigments for LHCI formation, where only preliminary results are available up to now for Lhca1 and Lhca4 (41Schmid V.H.R. Beutelmann P. Schmidt G.W. Paulsen H. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. I. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1998: 425-428Google Scholar). To gain insight into pigment binding by LHCI subfractions, we isolated LHCI-680 and LHCI-730 from tomato leaves and determined their pigment composition. For further dissection of pigment binding by these LHCI subpopulations, we constructed expression plasmids of lhca2 and lhca3, so that now, for the first time, we could overexpress and reconstitute the full set of LHCI apoproteins. This allowed differentiation of pigment binding by individual Lhca proteins, which are present in twos in LHCI-680 or LHCI-730. Finally, the role of individual pigments for LHCI formation was tested by reconstituting each Lhca protein in the absence of an individual pigment species. The obtained results provide a better insight into differential pigment binding of the various LHCI and demonstrate that distinct pigment requirements exist for formation of the individual LHCIs. The presented data fill a gap regarding knowledge of pigment composition of LHCs in higher plants and form the basis for future analyses aiming to elucidate potentially different functions of the various LHCIs. Isolation of PS I from tomato thylakoids was as described in Ref. 29Schmid V.H.R. Cammarata K.V. Bruns B.U. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7667-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar. Following ultracentrifugation (24 h, 112,500 × g) the PS I-containing band was collected, diluted with 5 volumes of cold distilled water, and centrifuged overnight at 258,000 ×g. The resulting PS I pellet was suspended in 10 mm Tricine/NaOH (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA/NaOH (pH 7.8), and 30% sucrose and stored at −70 °C at a Chl concentration of 1.5–2 mg/ml. For isolation of LHCI thawed PS I preparations were diluted with 4 volumes of cold distilled water and centrifuged (42,000 × g, 30 min). The pellet was suspended in 5 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) to a Chl concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and solubilized by adding 0.2% Zwittergent 3–16, 1%n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside and 1%n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside and mixing for 60 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of this solution equivalent to 0.5 mg of Chl were loaded onto sucrose gradients (0.06–0.8 m sucrose, 5 mm Tricine/NaOH (pH 7.8), and 0.1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside). Centrifugation was performed for 25 h at 246,000 × g and 4 °C. The two bands containing LHCI (second and third from the top) were collected, concentrated with centricons (cut off 10 kDa; Millipore, Eschborn, Germany), and used immediately for characterization or stored at −70 °C. Alternatively, density gradient bands containing LHCI-680 and LHCI-730 were diluted 20-fold with 2 mm Tricine-NaOH (pH 7.8) and centrifuged overnight at 602,000 × g to remove sucrose and n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside. LHCI pellets were suspended in a small volume of the supernatant and used for determination of the Chl/protein stoichiometry as described below. cDNAs of tomato lhca2 andlhca3, kindly provided by E. Pichersky (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI), were used for PCR with Pfupolymerase to produce restriction sites suitable for cloning into expression plasmids. Primers were designed to generate restrictions sites for NdeI and BamHI (lhca2) andBamHI and SalI (lhca3). Amplified DNA was precipitated and subsequently digested with the respective restriction enzymes. Following a further precipitation lhca2was ligated into the pet3a vector (Novagen, Bad Soden, Germany), andlhca3 was ligated into the pDS expression plasmid (42Bujard H. Gentz R. Lanzer M. Stueber D. Mueller M. Ibrahimi I. Haeuptle M.-T. Dobberstein B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 416-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Molecular biological work was performed according to standard procedures (43Sambrook K. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For cloning of lhca2 into the vector, an internal BamHI site had to be removed first by introduction of a silent mutation following the PCR-based mutation protocol of Ref.44Chen B. Przybyla A.E. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 657-659PubMed Google Scholar. To achieve overexpression, the first base triplet GTT coding for Val had to be replaced by the triplet TCA coding for serine and silent mutations had to be introduced in the third (GCT instead of GCA), fourth (GAT instead of GAC), and fifth (CCA instead of CCT) triplets, which was achieved by using an appropriate forward primer for PCR. The cloning strategy resulted in an additional vector derived Met at the N terminus of Lhca2. Use of the pDS expression plasmid for lhca3 resulted in four additional amino acids (Met, Arg, Gly, and Ser) at the N terminus of the protein. Correct DNA amplification and ligation was examined by DNA sequencing of the entire coding region. In addition the pDS expression plasmids harboringlhca1 and lhca4 described in Ref. 45Rupprecht J. Paulsen H. Schmid V.H.R. Photosynth. Res. 2000; 63: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar were used. For overexpression of Lhca1, Lhca3, and Lhca4, the corresponding pDS expression plasmids were transformed into Escherichia colistrain JM 101 and overnight cultures in Luria Bertrani medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin (LB-Amp) were grown. These cultures were used as inoculum for new LB-Amp cultures, which were grown to an optical density of approximately 0.6 under agitation (175 rpm, 37 °C). Following addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm incubation was continued for another 4 to 5 h under the same conditions. Afterward cells were collected by centrifugation (5 min, 10,000 × g) for inclusion body preparation. The pet vector with lhca2 was transformed into E. coli Bl 21 cells. These cells were grown overnight in LB-Amp supplemented with 2% glucose. Then cells were collected by centrifugation (5 min, 10,000 × g), suspended in glucose depleted LB-Amp and grown to an optical density of approximately 0.5 (225 rpm, 37 °C). Following the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 1 mm (final concentration), cultures were kept at 40 °C for 8 h under agitation (225 rpm). Finally, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 5 min). The inclusion body protein was isolated as described (46Paulsen H. Schmid V.H.R. Smith A.G. Witty M. Heme, Chlorophyll and Bilins: Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 235-253Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of inclusion body preparations were determined by a dye binding assay (47Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216357) Google Scholar), and accumulation of recombinant Lhca proteins was checked by fully denaturing PAGE according to Ref. 48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar with subsequent Coomassie staining.

The reconstitution mixtures contained either 30 μg of inclusion body protein and pigments equivalent to 40 μg of Chla+b for subsequent partially denaturing gel electrophoresis (49Schmid V.H.R.

For analysis of differences in pigment binding, the different Lhca proteins were reconstituted with the same total pigment extract. The molar ratio of neo:vio:lut:Chlb:Chl a:β-car in total pigment extract was 0.2:0.2:1:2.9:8.5:0.1.To test the significance of individual pigment species for LHC formation, mixtures of individual pigments were used; for Lhca1 and Lhca4 reconstitution mixtures contained the pigments in the stoichiometry that was found for native LHCI-730, those for Lhca2 and Lhca3 had the same composition as native LHCI-680 (cf.Table I). In these analyses one Chl or carotenoid species was omitted, and the amount of the other Chl or carotenoids was increased correspondingly to maintain the original Chl/carotenoid stoichiometry.Table IPigment composition of native LHCI isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugationNeoLutVioChl bChlaβ-carChl a+bChla/bΣ carotenoidsChl/carotenoidsLHCI-680ND0.92 ± 0.030.43 ± 0.062.59 ± 0.266.40 ± 0.480.40 ± 0.048.99 ± 0.702.48 ± 0.141.76 ± 0.065.12 ± 0.32LHCI-730ND0.99 ± 0.040.54 ± 0.032.87 ± 0.128.55 ± 0.360.42 ± 0.0111.41 ± 0.482.98 ± 0.021.94 ± 0.045.88 ± 0.21Extracted pigments were quantified by HPLC, and the pigment amounts are given on basis of one apoprotein.

Photometric Chl quantification was performed in 80% acetone using the equations of Porra et al. (50Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4694) Google Scholar). Protein quantification of LHCIs by the BCA assay (51Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18642) Google Scholar) was performed with samples adjusted to equal Chl amounts. Absorption was corrected for Chl by parallel measurement of the samples in BCA solution lacking CuSO4. Bovine serum albumin was used as a reference protein. Chl/protein stoichiometries of native LHCI-680 and LHCI-730 were calculated by using a molecular mass of 23.5 kDa for LHCI-680 (average of Lhca2 and Lhca3) and 21.5 kDa for LHCI-730 (average of Lhca1 and Lhca4). For analysis of pigment composition by HPLC, pigments of density gradient bands were extracted by secondary-butanol (52Martinson T.A. Plumley F.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), diluted with acetone, and loaded onto a Chromolith SpeedROD RP-18e column (Merck), which was developed with an acetone gradient from 70 to 100%. Eluted pigments were detected by a MD-1515 multiwavelength detector (Jasco, Gross-Umstadt, Germany) and quantified on basis of calibration curves obtained for individual pigments. 77 K fluorescence emission spectra were recorded with a Fluoromax 2 (ISA Jobin Yvon-Spex, Grasbrunn, Germany). Samples from the density gradients were adjusted to 60% glycerol, 5 mmTricine/NaOH (pH 7.8), 0.05% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, and 2 μg Chl/ml. The measurements were done in 1-nm steps with a slit width of 2 nm for excitation and emission light. Excitation was at 410 nm. Fractionation of PS I by density gradient ultracentrifugation resulted in the resolution of two bands in the upper part of the centrifuge tube (Fig.1 A), which were strongly enriched in LHCI proteins. The lower density band had a fluorescence emission around 680 nm with peaks at 680 and 686 nm (Fig.1 B, dashed line). The higher density band exhibited a strong fluorescence at 734 nm (Fig. 1 B,solid line). Thus, the spectra allowed assignment of the density gradient bands to LHCI-680 and LHCI-730, which was confirmed by analysis of their polypeptide composition (Fig. 1 C). LHCI-680 migrates like a monomer in a partially denaturing gel (not shown), is strongly enriched in Lhca2 and Lhca3, and is only slightly contaminated by other Lhc proteins.

https://openalex.org/W1986480161,"The retinoblastoma suppressor gene product Rb has been assigned a critical role in cell cycle regulation, the induction of differentiation, and inhibition of oncogenic transformation. Inheritance of a mutant RB allele in humans is responsible for bilateral retinoblastoma, a malignant tumor of the retina. Trilateral retinoblastoma (TRB) is a rare variant of familial retinoblastoma in which, in addition to retinal tumors, tumors develop from the pineal gland, an organ ontologically related to the retina. Germline inactivation of Rb in mice leads to mid-gestational lethality with defects in erythropoeisis and neurogenesis. This embryonic lethality prohibits the analysis of Rb function in selected cell types at later stages of development or in the adult. Here, we describe the Cre-LoxP mediated somatic inactivation of Rb in a subset of neuroendocrine cells, including photoreceptor cells. We observed neuroendocrine tumors of the pineal and pituitary gland. These tumors invariably showed inactivation of Rb and Trp53. Remarkably, loss of Rb in photoreceptor cells does not lead to retinoblastoma or any phenotypic changes, not even when photoreceptor cells are made deficient in Rb, p107 and Trp53. Our results highlight the important differences that exist in tumor susceptibility between mice and man (e.g pineal gland) and question the photoreceptor cell origin of human retinoblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2001746115,"Rat renal mesangial cells express high levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in response to inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β). We tested whether ligands of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARα) could influence the cytokine-induced expression of MMP-9. Different PPARα agonists dose-dependently inhibited the IL-1β-triggered increase in gelatinolytic activity mainly by decreasing the MMP-9 steady-state mRNA levels. PPARα agonists on their own had no effects on MMP-9 mRNA levels and gelatinolytic activity. Surprisingly, the reduction of MMP-9 mRNA levels by PPARα activators contrasted with an amplification of cytokine-mediated MMP-9 gene promoter activity and mRNA expression. The potentiation of MMP-9 promoter activity functionally depends on an upstream peroxisome proliferator-responsive element-like binding site, which displayed an increased DNA binding of a PPARα immunopositive complex. In contrast, the IL-1β-induced DNA-binding of nuclear factor κB was significantly impaired by PPARα agonists. Most interestingly, in the presence of an inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor, the PPARα-mediated suppression switched to a strong amplification of IL-1β-triggered MMP-9 mRNA expression. Concomitantly, activators of PPARα potentiated the cytokine-induced iNOS expression. Using actinomycin D, we found that NO, but not PPARα activators, strongly reduced the stability of MMP-9 mRNA. In contrast, the stability of MMP-9 protein was not affected by PPARα activators. In summary, our data suggest that the inhibitory effects of PPARα agonists on cytokine-induced MMP-9 expression are indirect and primarily due to a superinduction of iNOS with high levels of NO reducing the half-life of MMP-9 mRNA.

Physiologically, the balance between synthesis and degradation of matrix proteins is guaranteed by the action of a family of zinc-dependent, neutral proteinases designated matrix metalloproteases (MMPs).1 A tight regulation of these proteases is accomplished by different mechanisms, including the regulation of gene expression, the processing of the inactive zymogenes by other proteases, and finally, the inhibition of the active enzymes by the action of endogenous inhibitors of MMPs, the TIMPs (for review, see Ref. 4Nagase H. Woessner J.F., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3860) Google Scholar). Cultured mesangial cells (MC) respond to proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor or interleukin-1β (IL-1β) with the production of several MMPs, including MMP-9 (gelatinase-B), mainly due to an increase in gene transcription (5Yokoo T. Kitamura M Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F123-F130PubMed Google Scholar, 6Eberhardt W. Beeg T. Beck K.F. Walpen S. Gauer S. Bohles H. Pfeilschifter J. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The transcriptional regulation of the rat MMP-9 gene by proinflammatory cytokines is localized to a 0.7-kb region upstream from the transcriptional start site and critically depends on the binding sites for activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factors, respectively (5Yokoo T. Kitamura M Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F123-F130PubMed Google Scholar, 7Eberhardt W. Huwiler A. Beck K.F. Walpen S. Pfeilschifter J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5788-5797Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Besides MMP-9, MC under inflammatory conditions can express a variety of genes coding for potent inflammatory mediators, such as inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), the cytosolic and secreted types of phospholipases (PLA-2), and cyclooxygenase 2, respectively (8Pfeilschifter J. Schwarzenbach H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 273: 185-187Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 9Pfeilschifter J. Schalkwijk C. Briner V.A. Van den Bosch H. J. Clin.

Metabolites of these enzymes themselves can have modulatory effects on MMP-9 expression, as we have previously reported a NO-mediated suppression of cytokine-induced MMP-9 expression (6Eberhardt W. Beeg T. Beck K.F. Walpen S. Gauer S. Bohles H. Pfeilschifter J. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Pharmacologically, the transcriptional activation of MMP-9 is modulated by agonists of the glucocorticoid receptor mainly through interference with NF-κB and members of the Ets/PEA transcription factor family. 2W. Eberhardt, unpublished observations. 2W. Eberhardt, unpublished observations. We now searched for a possible modulation of MMP-9 expression by agonists of another member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) (for review, see Ref. 12Corton J.C. Anderson S. Staube A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 491-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Three distinct PPAR subtypes have been identified, PPARα, -β/δ, and -γ, with each subtype showing a specific distribution, physiologic function, and a specific set of endogenous as well as synthetic ligands. Physiologically, PPARs are key players in lipid and glucose metabolism, and therefore, disturbances of PPAR function have been implicated in a variety of metabolic disorders such as dyslipidemia and diabetes (13Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). In addition, PPARα, similar to PPARγ, has been reported to exert potent anti-inflammatory activities in various cell types by inhibiting the expression of inflammatory genes such as COX-2 (14Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Fadel A. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Maclouf J. Tedgui A.

Endocrinol. 2001; 169: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) just to name a few of them. In accordance with these in vitro data, PPARα-deficient mice display an exacerbated response to inflammatory stimuli (14Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Torra I.P. Delerive P.

Moreover, PPARα null mice exhibit a higher degree of kidney damage in response to ischemia/reperfusion injury when compared with wild type controls, thus indicating that PPARα, in addition to its antiinflammatory actions, exhibits also cytoprotective properties in the kidney (18Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar,19Portilla D. Dai G. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Crew M.D. Proia A.D. Am. J.

Interestingly, recent observations demonstrate a role of glucocorticoids in PPARα gene expression in the development of rat kidney, suggesting a cross-talk between both nuclear hormone receptor pathways (20Djouadi, F., and Bastin, J. (2001) 12, 1197–1203Google Scholar). Although many studies have addressed the question of how PPARs directly activate gene expression via PPREs, less information exists about negative mechanisms that mostly involve interference with transcriptional activators. In this study we provide an additional mechanism by which PPARα agonists, independent of direct transcriptional effects, indirectly, via amplification of nitric oxide production, can efficiently regulate the level of cytokine-induced MMP-9 expression. Human recombinant IL-1β was from Cell Concept (Umkirch, Germany). The PPARα activators were WY-14,643 and LY-171883, and the NO donors were DETA-NONOate andS-nitroso-d-penicillamine. The NOS inhibitor wasNG-monomethyl l-arginine (l-NMMA), Actinomycin-D (from Streptomycesspecies) and cycloheximide were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (Gru¨nberg, Germany). Ribonucleotides and restriction enzymes as well as modifying enzymes were purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Rat glomerular MC were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 5 ng/ml insulin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Serum-free preincubations were performed in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for 24 h before cytokine treatment. For experiments, 3.0–5.0 × 106 of MC/10-cm culture dish were used between passages 8 and 19. All supplements were purchased from Invitrogen. The amount of dead cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion, and the amount of cells was determined by use of a Neubauer chamber. Cell cytotoxicity was measured by the use of a cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche Diagnostics). cDNA inserts for rat MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were generated as described recently (6Eberhardt W. Beeg T. Beck K.F. Walpen S. Gauer S. Bohles H. Pfeilschifter J. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A cDNA for rat TIMP-2 was generated using internal primers of coding sequence of rat TIMP-2 mRNA (GenBankTM accession no AJ409332). The following primers were used: 5′-CGG GAA TGA CAT CTA TGG CAA CC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAA GCT GGA CCA GCC TCG ATG TC-3′ (antisense). A glyceralaldehyd-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA clone was generated using the internal primers of the coding sequence of rat glyceralaldehyd-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA (accession number NM017008). A cDNA insert from mouse 18 S rRNA was from Ambion (Austin, TX). The 5′-flanking region of the rat MMP-9 gene was cloned utilizing the Genome Walker kit (CLONTECH Laboratories, Heidelberg, Germany) using internal (upstream) and external (downstream) primers from the rat MMP-9 cDNA (accession number U36476) as follows: MMP-9 internal primer, 5′-AGGGGCAGCAAAGCTGTAGCCTAG-3′ and MMP-9 external primer, 5′-TTTCAGGTCTCGGGGGAAGACCACATA-3′. A 1.8-kb fragment from a EcoRV-cut library was isolated by PCR under stringent conditions. The fragment was subsequently subcloned into pBluescript-II KS+ and sequenced using the automated sequence analyzer ABI 310 (PE Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). The sequence has been deposited in the GenBankTM/EMBL databases (accession number A7438266). Subsequently, the 1.8-kb fragment of MMP-9 promoter was subcloned into pGL-III Basic vector coding for beetle luciferase (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) using XbaI and XhoI restriction sites. Introduction of a double point mutation into a putative distal PPRE-like site (GT to CA) to generate pGL-MMP-9-ΔPPRE-1 was performed using the forward primer 5′-ATG GAG ACT CAA GCA CAC CTA TGT GT-3′ (corresponding to a region from −1763 to −1738). Generation of a double transition into a second proximal-lying PPRE-like binding site to generate pGL-MMP-9 ΔPPRE-2 was done using the forward primer 5′-TCC CAT CCA GCA CAC CCC GAG GCT TA-3′ (corresponding to a region from −896 to −871). All mutant constructs were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Transient transfections of MC were performed using Effectene reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Transfections were performed following the manufacturer’s instructions. The transfections were performed as triplicates and repeated at least three times to ensure reproducibility of the results. Transfection with pRL-CMV coding for Renillaluciferase was used to control for transfection efficiencies. Luciferase activities were measured with the dual reporter gene system (Promega) using an automated chemiluminescence detector (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany) Total cellular RNA was extracted from MC using the Tri reagent (Sigma). Procedures for RNA hybridization were as described previously (6Eberhardt W. Beeg T. Beck K.F. Walpen S. Gauer S. Bohles H. Pfeilschifter J. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Assessment of gelatinolytic activity of proteins from cellular supernatants was performed as described previously (6Eberhardt W. Beeg T. Beck K.F. Walpen S. Gauer S. Bohles H. Pfeilschifter J. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that alterations in gelatinolytic contents were due to differences in cell numbers, we routinely determined total cell numbers under each of the experimental conditions. Proteins with gelatinolytic activity were visualized as areas of lytic activity on an otherwise blue gel. Migration properties of proteins were determined by comparison with that of prestained full range rainbow protein markers (Amersham Biosciences). In these experiments we tested the effects of the PPARα agonist WY-14,643 on MMP activities in the conditioned culture medium harvested from MC. Incubations were carried out in a total volume of 100 μl. After incubation (16 h) at room temperature, samples were mixed with 2× sample buffer (4% SDS, 0.005% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol) and loaded directly on gels for SDS-PAGE zymography. Preparation of crude nuclear extracts from cultured mesangial cells and subsequent EMSA was performed as described previously (21Eberhardt W. Pluss C. Hummel R. Pfeilschifter J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4961-4969PubMed Google Scholar). The primers used for EMSA are as depicted in Table I. Competition experiments were done by coincubation with different dilutions of a primer stock solution corresponding to 10-, 100-, and 1000-fold excess (10, 100, 1000 pmol) of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide in the DNA-protein binding reaction. Wild type and mutant consensus oligonucleotides for competition experiments were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

PPARα- and -γ-specific antibodies used for supershift experiments were purchased from Affinity Bio Reagents (Golden, CO). Polyclonal antibodies specific for p50 and p65 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For supershift analysis, 2 μl of the antibody were preincubated overnight in a cold room before the binding reaction. For each assay nuclei from ∼3 × 107 cells were isolated by lysing cells in ice-cold 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were isolated by spinning at 800 × g and, finally, resuspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 40% glycerol. For further procedures we combined the classical run-on protocol with that of the more sensitive RNase protection assay and proceeded as followed. Nuclei suspensions were mixed with an equal volume of 2× reaction buffer containing 100 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl, 200 units of RNasin and 1 mm of each ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Transcription was stopped by adding 20 μg of DNase I followed by 80 μg of proteinase K. Subsequently the nuclear RNA was isolated by using the Tri reagent and by subsequent chloroform precipitation after simple ethanol precipitation. A cDNA clone coding for rat MMP-9 (pKs-MMP-9 rat) was linearized with PvuII and used as a template for MMP-9 antisense RNA. The MMP-9 antisense transcript was synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol). Nuclear RNA and 100,000 cpm of the labeled T7-derived MMP-9 antisense transcript were co-precipitated by ethanol precipitation and hybridized at 42 °C overnight in 30 μl of FAB hybridization buffer containing 80%, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm PIPES (pH 6.4), and 400 mm NaCl. After hybridization, samples were digested with RNase A and T1 for 1 h at 30 °C. RNA samples were again extracted with phenol/chloroform, and protected double-stranded RNA hybrids were ethanol-precipitated. The protected fragments were separated on a 5% acrylamide, 8 m urea gel and analyzed using a phosphorimaging. The amount of MMP-9 RNA signals was normalized by hybridizing the same set of RNA samples with a radioactively labeled antisense RNA coding for rat glyceralaldehyd-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The total cellular levels of iNOS protein were analyzed by Western blot analysis using total cellular extracts (50 μg) and probed with a polyclonal antibody specific for rat N-terminal iNOS (22Kunz D. Walker G. Wiesenberg I. Pfeilschifter J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1621-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Total cellular levels of MMP-9 were assessed by use of a polyclonal antibody specific for rat MMP-9 (Chemicon, Hofheim, Germany). Nitrite contents of cellular supernatants were measured as a readout for NOS activity. 100 μl of supernatants were mixed with 100 μl of Griess reagent (Merck). The absorbance at 540 nm with a reference wavelength at 595 nm was measured, and nitrite concentration was determined using a calibration curve with sodium nitrite standards. Results are expressed as the means ± S.D. The data are presented as x-fold induction compared with control conditions or compared with IL-1β-stimulated values (#). Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t test and analysis of variance for significance. p values < 0.01 (** or ##) were considered significant. The family of gelatinases includes the two genetically distinct 72- and 92-kDa type IV collagenases, MMP-2 and MMP-9, respectively, both of which are expressed in MC. Whereas MMP-2 shows a constitutive expression, MMP-9 expression is highly induced by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β (6Eberhardt W. Beeg T. Beck K.F. Walpen S. Gauer S. Bohles H. Pfeilschifter J. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 7Eberhardt W. Huwiler A. Beck K.F. Walpen S. Pfeilschifter J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5788-5797Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Because the expression of MMP-9 in MC after treatment with IL-1β reaches a maximal level after 24 h we chose incubation times of 24 h. To evaluate possible effects of PPARα activators on the proteolytic activity secreted into the conditioned media from cytokine-treated cells, MC were treated with IL-1β (2 nm) in the presence or absence of different concentrations of WY-14,643, a potent activator of PPARα (12Corton J.C. Anderson S. Staube A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 491-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The gelatinolytic content of conditioned medium of MC withdrawn after 24 h of stimulation was tested by zymography using gelatin as a substrate. WY-14,643 reduced in a dose-dependent manner the IL-1β-stimulated MMP-9 activity with a maximal inhibition seen at 100 μm. WY-14,643 alone had no effects on enzyme secretion (Fig. 1A). Higher concentrations used in 24-h incubations caused cytotoxic effects as monitored by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide test (data not shown). The levels of the lytic activity of latent and active MMP-2, represented by the two lytic bands at 68 and 72 kDa, remained unchanged under all experimental conditions, consistent with the constitutive expression of MMP-2 in rat MC (7Eberhardt W. Huwiler A. Beck K.F. Walpen S. Pfeilschifter J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5788-5797Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether the reduction of the lytic content of MMP-9 is due to a decrease in the amount of the corresponding MMP-9 mRNA, we performed Northern blot analysis using a cDNA probe from the rat MMP-9 gene (6Eberhardt W. Beeg T. Beck K.F. Walpen S. Gauer S. Bohles H. Pfeilschifter J. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, WY-14,643 dose-dependently attenuated the cytokine-induced MMP-9 mRNA level with a maximal inhibition seen at 100 μmWY. WY-14,643 given alone had no effects on the basal MMP-9 mRNA levels. These data indicate that the alterations of cytokine-induced zymogen activity by WY-14,643 predominantly result from changes in the MMP-9 expression levels. We next checked mRNA levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, the endogenous inhibitors of MMP-9. Most interestingly, TIMP-1 followed a similar expression pattern as MMP-9, showing a strong increase of basal mRNA levels by IL-1β and a dose-dependent attenuation of IL-1β-induced steady-state mRNA levels by WY-14,643 (Fig. 1B). Similarly to MMP-9, basal TIMP-1 mRNA levels were not affected by WY-14,643. In contrast, TIMP-2 displayed high basal steady-state mRNA levels that were attenuated by IL-1β and furthermore attenuated by the highest concentration (100 μm) of WY-14,643 (Fig.1B). Furthermore, we tested other PPAR activators on MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 steady-state mRNA levels. The concentrations used were in a range known to maximally stimulate PPAR activation in cell cultures. As shown in Fig. 1C, the prototypic PPAR ligand LY-171883, in a way similar to WY-14,643, dose-dependently inhibited the amounts of IL-1β-induced MMP-9 and TIMP-1 steady-state mRNAs, respectively. The reduction of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 mRNA levels again was paralleled by a decrease of MMP-9 activity in the conditioned media (data not shown). In contrast, the high basal levels of TIMP-2 mRNA were reduced by IL-1β and further attenuated by increasing concentrations of LY-171,883 (Fig. 1C). These data demonstrate that the inhibition of MMP-9 levels is not paralleled by an increased expression of TIMPs. To evaluate whether PPARα agonists are able to alter the activity of secreted MMP-9, we performed in vitrozymography. Conditioned media from cytokine-treated MC were incubated for 16 h with or without WY-14,643 (100 μm). The lytic band at 92 kDa, which is not detectable under control conditions but is inducible by IL-1β, corresponds to the inactive proform of MMP-9 as is demonstrated by cleavage to the active 86-kDa form by treatment with different concentrations ofp-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) (Fig.2B). As shown in Fig.2A, WY-14,643 does not alter the gelatinolytic activity of pro-MMP-9, thus indicating that the observed WY-mediated reduction of zymogen activity is due to a reduction of IL-1β-mediated expression and secretion of pro-MMP-9. To evaluate whether the PPARα-mediated inhibition of IL-1β-induced MMP-9 steady-state mRNA levels resulted from an inhibition of MMP-9 gene transcription, we cloned a 1.8-kb promoter fragment of the rat MMP-9 gene by genome walking using MMP-9 gene-specific antisense primers as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In addition to a multitude of putative elements involved in the cytokine-mediated regulation of MMP-9 expression, we found by computational analysis two regions that displayed a high homology to PPRE-like motifs and which were denoted as PPRE-1 and PPRE-2, respectively (Fig. 3A). Transient transfection of MC with pGL-MMP-9 (1.8 kb), comprising the 1.8-kb promoter fragment fused to a luciferase reporter gene, was followed by a 24-h treatment with either vehicle, IL-1β (2 nm), WY-14,643 (100 μm), or both compounds in combination and assayed for luciferase activity. IL-1β significantly stimulated luciferase activity (2.67-fold, p < 0.01), and surprisingly, this was further amplified by the addition of WY-14,643 (4.1-fold, p < 0.01), which on its own had a moderate stimulatory effect on MMP-9 promoter activity (1.8-fold,p < 0.01, Fig. 3B). We recently have identified AP-1 and NF-κB response elements as being crucially involved in the IL-1β-mediated transcriptional activation of MMP-9 (7Eberhardt W. Huwiler A. Beck K.F. Walpen S. Pfeilschifter J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5788-5797Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To test for a functional role of the two putative PPREs in the amplification of cytokine-induced MMP-9 promoter activity by PPARα ligands, each PPRE was point-mutated by an exchange of two base pairs and tested for remaining promoter inducibility (TableI). Mutation of the proximal PPRE at −888/−872 (PPRE-2) had no effect on promoter inducibility independent of which stimulus was used (Fig. 3C). In contrast, mutation of a distal-lying PPRE at −1752/−1738 (PPRE-1) prevented the potentiation of cytokine-induced MMP-9 promoter activity by WY-14,643 without affecting promoter activation by IL-1β (Fig. 3D). These data suggest that PPRE-1, in contrast to PPRE-2, is functionally involved in the amplification of cytokine-induced MMP-9 promoter activity by PPARα without affecting cytokine-induced transcription of MMP-9. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that the modulation of cytokine-induced mRNA steady-state levels by PPARα agonists cannot be explained by regulatory events occurring in the upstream 1.8-kb MMP-9 promoter context. To further confirm the functionality of a cognate PPRE-promoter binding site in the transcriptional amplification of MMP-9, we performed EMSA using a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide comprising the critical PPRE-1 binding site. Treatment of cells with IL-1β (2 nm) or WY-14,643 (50 and 100 μm) caused binding of a single slow migrating complex (Fig. 4A, left panel). Importantly, the intensity of DNA binding was strongly increased when both reagents were given in combination (Fig.4A, left panel). Similar results were obtained with a PPRE consensus oligonucleotide (data not shown). The identity of the DNA-bound complex was confirmed by shifting the EMSA band through the addition of a PPARα-specific antibody (Fig. 4A), whereas the addition of a PPARγ-specific antibody had no effects on DNA binding (Fig. 4A, right panel). Interestingly, the disappearance of the PPRE-1-positive band after the addition of the PPARα antibody was paralleled with the appearance of a strong band with faster migration prop"
https://openalex.org/W2033376574,"The oncogenic fusion protein p210 Bcr-Abl is causally associated with virtually all cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia. The wild-type Bcr product has several recognizable structural and functional motifs including a domain that contains guanine nucleotide exchange activity for Rho family GTPases (DH/PH domain). Although this domain is retained within p210 Bcr-Abl, it has no known signaling activities in vivo. Here we report that a fragment of Bcr that encodes the isolated DH/PH domain is a potent activator of the NF-κB transcription factor. Within the context of full length Bcr, this activity is regulated by proximal flanking sequences that suppress the DH/PH domain encoded guanine nucleotide exchange activity. NF-κB activation by Bcr is not mediated by nuclear translocation, but rather by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent modification of the RelA/p65 transactivation domain. Although we were able to demonstrate that Bcr can function as an exchange factor for Cdc42 in vivo, NF-κB activation appears to occur via a Cdc42-independent mechanism. These studies constitute direct evidence that the Bcr RhoGEF domain can function in vivo, and identify a new signaling activity that may contribute to the transforming potential of p210 Bcr-Abl."
https://openalex.org/W2012507614,"A major obstacle to obtaining more detailed insights into the diversity of phenotypic and molecular changes occurring in colon cancer cells is the lack of low-passage colon cancer cell lines, which would still closely reflect the phenotype of the colon cancer cells in vivo. Here, we characterize eight novel, low passage number human colon carcinoma cell lines, originating from colorectal cancers extensively characterized in the clinics. All cell lines closely resemble the original tumors with respect to phenotype, markers and detectable genetic changes. Cell morphology and marker expression is highly variable, ranging from fully polarized cells correctly expressing all basolateral epithelial markers, to cells with mesenchymal characteristics and a complete loss of polarity due to delocalization or loss of junction complex proteins. The alterations in phenotype and epithelial marker expression correspond to changes already detectable in the primary tumor in vivo. Seven of the cell lines show chromosomal instability, while one cell line is characterized by microsatellite instability. p53 associated with K-ras mutations were detected in three cell lines. Hitherto non-described E-cadherin mutations were found at both alleles in one cell line whereas in another cell line the E-cadherin protein was down-regulated. A stabilizing β-catenin mutation (S45F) appears in the same cell line that carried the mutated E-cadherin gene. Six cell lines carried APC mutations, which in five of the lines led to an activated β-catenin/Tcf/LEF signaling pathway. In accordance with β-catenin/Tcf/LEF activation, the cell lines show increased migration and invasiveness. Our results show that the characterized, low-passage cell lines mirror the diversity of the individual tumors from which they were derived. Through molecular analyses of these cell lines we demonstrate that tumorgenicity events are much more diverse in human colon cancer than expected, despite the common origin of the tumors from a small patient group with similar tumor grading and clinical prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2334955491,"Tumorigenesis is a multi-step process involving a series of changes of cellular genes. Most solid tumors and hematopoietic malignancies often show abnormal chromosome numbers, the aneuploidy. The chromosomal aneuploidy keeps cells in the state of chromosomal instability (CIN) that will increase the mutation rate of cells affected and thus push them deeper into the process of tumorigenesis. The yeast genetic studies showed that normal distribution of chromosome during mitosis is under the surveillance of a set of genes, the spindle assembly checkpoint genes, that include the BUB and MAD gene groups and MPS. In some colorectal cancers with CIN it was found to have hBUB1 gene mutated and the mutated gene functions dominantly. We have examined a series of breast cancer cell lines with or without CIN for the hBUB1 gene mutation and found none. However, we detected various degrees of deletion in the coding sequences of the hBUB1 gene in cells from T lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines, Molt3 and Molt4, and cells from some acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Hodgkin's lymphoma patients. So far the lesions of deletion are in the kinetochore localization domain of the hBUB1 gene that may explain why the deletion lesions in the BUB1 gene cause aneuploidy in lymphoma and lymphoma cells. The deletions are heterozygous in nature. Like the mutated hBUB1 gene in colorectal cancer, the mutant hBUB1 cDNA from lymphoblastic leukemia cells behaves dominantly."

Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995Crossref Google Scholar). Many P450s play catalytic roles critical to life (e.g. sterol hydroxylases in mammals) or, because of less restricted selectivity, provide organisms with the means of (i) generating secondary metabolites for defense (e.g. antibiotics) (6Andersen J.F. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 725-735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) provide organisms with the capability to use certain chemicals as carbon sources (e.g. several microorganisms) (7Katagiri M. Ganguli B.N. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3543-3546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or (iii) detoxicate chemicals encountered in the environment. The so-called drug-metabolizing P450s fit into this latter category, and much interest has developed because of the relevance in pharmaceutical development (8Guengerich F.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450. 2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 473-535Crossref Google Scholar). Currently considerable attention has been given to substrate docking in P450 structures and models as a means of understanding and predicting catalytic activities (9Lewis D.F.V. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 10de Groot M.J. Ackland M.J. Horne V.A. Alex A.A. Jones B.C. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 4062-4070Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The juxtaposition of a substrate in the ground state can influence the rate-limiting steps in catalysis and, therefore, the catalytic selectivity. However, many of the details of catalysis may be relatively independent of ground state docking. Thus a need exists to examine many P450 reactions in as much detail as possible, in terms of providing an extensive description of exactly what steps are involved in influencing rates of P450 catalysis (11Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 611-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). The matter of identifying the rate-limiting steps in P450 reactions is not a new one, and the subject has been reviewed several times (11Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 611-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar, 12Bjorkhem I. Schenkman J.B. Kupfer D. Hepatic Cytochrome P-450 Monooxygenase System.

However, much of the early literature involved the use of relatively crude systems and limited methodology, and many of the key issues remain today. The literature often leaves a reader with the general impression that the reduction of P450 is the rate-limiting step (e.g. Refs. 12Bjorkhem I. Schenkman J.B. Kupfer D.

In the course of studies with the prototypic substrate bufuralol, we found that the rate of reduction of ferric P450 2D6 was enhanced by bufuralol and was not the rate-limiting step in the overall 1′-hydroxylation reaction (33Hanna I.H. Kim M.-S. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Hiroi et al. (36Hiroi T. Imaoka S. Funae Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Hanna I.H. Nishimura Y. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14215-14223Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (Scheme FS2). Analysis of the binding of these compounds to P450 2D6 provided evidence for the alteration of the substrate pKa by P450 2D6 (37Miller G.P. Hanna I.H. Nishimura Y. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14215-14223Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The relatively rapid rates of oxidation of the methoxyphenethylamines by P450 2D6 and the ability to employ kinetic hydrogen isotope effect analysis provided an opportunity to analyze the kinetics of these reactions in some detail. The step in which C–H bond cleavage occurs can be studied in detail in O-demethylation reactions due to (i) general considerations about using non-competitive intermolecular experiments to assess the rate-limiting contributions of C–H bond cleavage (3Northrop D.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 607-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 38Cook P.F. Yoon M.Y. Hara S.

We analyzed several of the individual reaction steps in the P450 2D6-catalyzedO-demethylations of 3- and 4-methoxyphenethylamine and, as in earlier work with P450 1A2-catalyzed O-dealkylation of 4-alkoxyacylanilides (27Yun C.-H.

The work collectively implicates both the accumulation of an oxygenated iron complex and C–H bond breaking in contribution to the rate-limiting step(s) of the reactions. As in the case of the P450 1A2 reactions, these P450 2D6 reactions are probably sensitive to a set of transition state barriers of similar energies. (±)-Bufuralol·HCl was a gift of Hoffmann-La Roche.

These compounds were dissolved as free bases in dry (C2H5)2O and saturated with dry HCl gas. The precipitated HCl salts were recrystallized once or twice from absolute C2H5OH to yield white salts, which were dissolved in H2O and added to enzyme reactions (in the absence of organic solvents). 4-Hydroxybenzyl cyanide (Aldrich, 4.26 g, 32 mmol) was mixed withd2-CH3I (Aldrich, 5.00 g, 35 mmol) and K2CO3 (4.42 g, 32 nmol) in 100 ml (CH3)2CO and heated with stirring under reflux for 40 h. The mixture was filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated to dryness in vacuo, dissolved in CHCl3, washed 3 times with 10% aqueous KOH, dried with Na2SO4, and (after filtration) evaporated to dryness in vacuo as follows: 4.68 g (98% yield);1H NMR (C2HCl3), δ 3.60 (s, 2H, –CH2–), 3.69 (s, 1H, –OCH2H2), 6.80 and 7.18 (d, 2H each, aromatic). Part of the above product (2.64 g, 18 mmol, unpurified) was dissolved in 20 ml of THF and added dropwise to a stirred solution of 18 ml of 1m BH3 in THF (under dry N2), in a 3-neck flash equipped with a condenser and drying tube (40Brown H.C. Rao B.C.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1960; 82: 681-686Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The reaction was stirred for an additional 90 min after all of the nitrile was added, and then 15 ml of concentrated HCl was carefully added. THF was removed in vacuo, and the residual aqueous phase was washed once with (C2H5)2O and made basic to litmus paper by the careful addition of 12 n NaOH. The product was extracted 3 times with CH2Cl2, and the combined organic fractions were dried with Na2SO4, filtered, and reduced in vacuo. The residue (2.74 g) was dissolved in (C2H5)2O, and HCl gas was bubbled through to give the HCl salt, which was recrystallized from absolute C2H5OH (yield 2.05 g, 60% yield): mp 211–215 °C (uncorrected) (lit. 212–214 °C (41Read G.W.

The phenol was methylated with C2H3I as described for the 4-isomer and subsequently reduced with BH3 (see above) to yield the HCl salt, recrystallized from C2H5OH (mp 131.5–133.5 °C); >99% atomic excess as indicated by MS (MH+m/z 155) and 1H NMR: (C2HCl3) δ 2.84 (dd, 2H, -CH2NH2), 3.04 (dd, 2H, PhCH2–), 6.82 (m, 3H, aromatic), 7.20 (t, 1H, aromatic o-H).

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). NADPH-P450 reductase (rat) was expressed in E. coli and purified as described (46Hanna I.H. Teiber J.F. Kokones K.L. Hollenberg P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Oxidation assays were generally conducted in 0.5-ml reaction volumes at 37 °C for 5 min in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing an NADPH-generating system (0.5 mm NADP+, 10 mm glucose 6-phosphate, and 1 unit of yeast glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ml−1). Reactions contained P450 2D6 (200 pmol) reconstituted with NADPH-P450 reductase (500 pmol) and 30 μg ofl-α-dialuroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine for 10 min at room temperature (prior to reactions). Mixtures were also supplemented with 1000 units of bovine liver catalase (previously dialyzed to remove thymol) and 20 μg of bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase, in order to destroy partially reduced oxygen species. Reaction mixtures were quenched with 50 μl of 68% HClO4and kept on ice for 10 min (to precipitate protein and salts), followed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. Aliquots (50–200 μl) of the recovered supernatants were injected onto a Zorbax octadecylsilane HPLC column (3 μm, 6.2 × 80 mm, Mac-Mod, Chadds Ford, PA), and eluted compounds were detected using a fluorescence detector (λ excitation 277 nm; λ emission 300 nm) (36Hiroi T. Imaoka S. Funae Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 838-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Chromatography was done at a flow rate of 2.5 ml min−1 utilizing 20 mmNH4CH3CO2 (pH 4.5) buffer containing CH3CN (1.8%, v/v), with the gradient increasing to 45%, v/v, after holding for 4 min. Quantitation of the products was achieved using standard curves generated using 3-hydroxy-, 4-hydroxy-, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine (traces of the latter did not contribute appreciably and could be ignored in the analyses). Measurements of NADPH oxidation were made using the reconstituted system described above (without catalase or superoxide dismutase) and with NADPH (200 μm) substituted for the NADPH-generating system. The decrease in A340was monitored (37 °C) in a modified Cary 14/OLIS spectrophotometer (On-Line Instrument Systems, Bogart, GA). For the estimation of H2O2, reactions were done as described in the case of catalytic assays (no catalase or superoxide dismutase) and terminated after 5 min with 0.83 ml of 3% Cl3CCO2H (w/v) (47Yun C.-H. Miller G.P. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11319-11329Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). H2O2 was determined spectrophotometrically by reaction with ferroammonium sulfate and KSCN as described (48Atkins W.M. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1610-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). H2O formation was determined by calculating the difference between total NADPH utilized and the sum of the product (derived from substrate) and H2O2 produced and then dividing by 2, because four electrons are required to reduce O2 to H2O (49Gorsky L.D. Koop D.R. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6812-6817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No correction was made for O2O, which was not measured and assumed to be converted to H2O2 under the acidic assays conditions. Deuterium isotope effects were determined by both non-competitive and competitive methods (2Northrop D.B. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2644-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 3Northrop D.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 607-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the non-competitive experiments, P450 2D6 was incubated with either the unlabeled (d0) or labeled (d3) methoxyphenethylamine using a range of substrate concentrations (10–5000 μm) in the general reconstituted system (37 °C, 5 min), and aliquots were analyzed for product formation (phenols) by HPLC as described above. Km andkcat were first estimated by nonlinear regression analysis of the data at the lower substrate concentrations, in which inhibition by a product was not observed, using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). The competitive isotope effect was determined for theO-demethylation of 4-[2H2]methoxyphenethylamine (d2, –OCHD2). HCHO was recovered from an incubation (5 min, 37 °C) as the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone and analyzed by combined gas chromatography/MS (positive ion mode) as described in detail previously (27Yun C.-H. Miller G.P. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4521-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The [2H1]formaldehyde hydrazone was monitored atm/z 211, and the [2H2]formaldehyde hydrazone was monitored at m/z 212. The ratio (2(M + 2)/(M + 1)) (m/z 212/211, from integration of selected ion monitoring chromatograms), was used as an estimate of the intrinsicDk for the C–H bond breaking step (27Yun C.-H. Miller G.P. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4521-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). P450 2D6 (7.5 nmol) was mixed with NADPH-P450 reductase (15 nmol) and freshly sonicatedl-α-dialuroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (250 μg). The reconstituted protein was supplemented with glucose oxidase (10 units ml−1, dialyzed against 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)), bovine liver catalase (450 units ml−1, dialyzed), and the substrate of interest in appropriate cases and brought to a final volume of 6.9 ml with 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in gas-tight tonometers. Anaerobic conditions were achieved with intermittent vacuum and argon/CO cycles and the subsequent addition of glucose to 0.10 m. Rates of P450 reduction were measured using stopped-flow spectrophotometric analysis at 37 °C, essentially as described previously (Applied Photophysics SX-18MV, Leatherhead, UK) (16Guengerich F.P. Johnson W.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14741-14750Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Multiple injections of the contents of the P450 tonometers were made against the contents of the NADPH-containing tonometer. Changes in absorbance at 447 nm were recorded and the resultant hyperbolic traces fitted to exponential functions to determine the rate and overall amplitude of the change in absorbance using the manufacturer’s software. The observed signal amplitude was compared with the expected amplitude to determine the percentage of P450 reduced (40–70% of the theoretical amount in all cases). Results of steady-state kinetic experiments were fit using the program DynaFit (50Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar), which is based in part upon KINSIM and FITSIM approaches (51Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 52Frieden C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 58-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 53Zimmerle C.T. Frieden C. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) but has several advantages and has been applied to simulation of P450 kinetics described previously (27Yun C.-H. Miller G.P. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4521-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The program was kindly provided by P. Kuzmic (Biokin Ltd., Pullman, WA) and run on a Macintosh G4 computer (Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA). The program can be used for reiterative fitting of rate and equilibrium constants. Some typical files are included as Supplemental Data. Quench reactions were done to determine whether a burst in product formation occurs. An observed burst would indicate that the product of the O-demethylation reaction (i.e. phenol) remains in the active site, and therefore its release limits the steady-state rate, or that some other step following production formation is rate-limiting (25Bell L.C. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29643-29651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 26Bell-Parikh L.C. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23833-23840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The kinetic courses of phenol formation are shown in Fig. 1. The observed data points were fit to linear regression curves, passing through zero with no obvious indication of any burst (r= 0.99). Thus, rate-limiting steps in methoxyphenethylamine oxidations catalyzed by P450 2D6 occur prior to product formation (steps 1–6 of Scheme FS1). The rate of P450 2D6 reduction (step 2, Scheme FS1) was much faster than steady-state turnover, even in the absence of substrate (Table I), as reported previously (33Hanna I.H. Kim M.-S. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the earlier work, reduction was stimulated in the presence of bufuralol (33Hanna I.H. Kim M.-S. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Rates of P450 2D6 reduction were stimulated 4- and 15-fold in the presence of 3- and 4-methoxyphenethylamine, respectively. (In all cases, the observed absorbance changes were fitted to double exponentials which afforded better fits than single exponentials.)Table IMeasurement of reduction rates of ferric P450 2D6Substratek1ΔA447,11-aFirst part of reaction.k2ΔA447,21-bSecond part of reaction.min−1min−1None1401.1 × 10−2170.8 × 10−24-Methoxyphenethylamine22201.8 × 10−2950.4 × 10−23-Methoxyphenethylamine5201.1 × 10−2550.5 × 10−21-a First part of reaction.1-b Second part of reaction. Open table in a new tab In a separate experiment, a reduction rate of 1920 min−1was measured in the presence of the ligand quinidine, a competitive inhibitor (54Otton S.V. Inaba T. Kalow W. Life Sci. 1984; 34: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies with 3- and 4- (d0) and (d3) methoxyphenethylamines yielded significant non-competitive kinetic deuterium isotope effects in both cases, in the range of 3–4. A non-competitive intramolecular experiment was done with 4-[2H2]methoxyphenethylamine (d2), with analysis of the formaldehyde 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone by gas chromatography/MS (results not shown). Analysis of the selected ion monitoring data, with correction for background in control experiments devoid of NADPH, yielded an estimate of the intrinsic isotope effect of 9.6 ± 1.0. Intermolecular non-competitive isotope effects were measured withd0- and d3-methoxy substrates, under conditions in which minimal depletion of the substrate was observed and the further oxidation of phenols to catechols was not a factor (37Miller G.P.

In this report, we have investigated the relationship between N-Myc and the developmental control gene Pax-3. Using transient transfection assays, we show that the Pax-3 promoter is activated by both N-Myc-Max and c-Myc-Max. Moreover, we show that Myc regulation ofPax-3 promoter activity is dependent upon a noncanonical E box site in the 5′ promoter region of Pax-3. In addition, we show that ectopic expression of both N-Myc and c-Myc leads to increased expression of Pax-3 mRNA. Furthermore, we show that Pax-3 mRNA expression is cell cycle-regulated and that the 5′ promoter region of Pax-3 (bp −1578 to +56) can direct cell cycle-dependent gene expression with kinetics similar to that of the endogenous transcript. Site-directed mutagenesis of the E box site within the Pax-3 promoter significantly altered the pattern of expression through the cell cycle. These results suggest that the Myc family of transcription factors may modulate Pax-3 expression in vivo.

These results suggest that the Myc family of transcription factors may modulate Pax-3 expression in vivo. N-Myc is a member of the Myc family of transcription factors (c-Myc, N-Myc, L-Myc, B-Myc, and S-Myc) that are characterized by a basic DNA binding domain and dimerization domain composed of a helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper. Members of this family have been shown to play a pivotal role in cell proliferation and terminal differentiation. The forced expression of c-Myc promotes progression into S phase and inhibits differentiation and entry into a quiescent state (1Freying S.O. Dang C.V. Lee W.M.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 339-343PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the deregulation of myc gene expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several tumor types. The human NMYC gene is frequently amplified in neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer of neural crest origin (2Schwab M. Altato K. Klempnauer K.H. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. Gibert F. Brodeur G. Goldstein M. Trent J. Nature. 1983; 316: 245-248Crossref Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 3Siamon D.J. Boone T.C. Seeger R.C. Keith D.E. Chazin V. Lee H.C. Souza I.M. Science. 1986; 232: 768-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).NMYC amplification in this cancer is associated with rapid tumor progression, advanced stages, and poor prognosis. N-myc shares many of the properties of c-myc, although unlike c-myc, whose expression appears to be ubiquitous, N-myc is primarily expressed during early embryogenesis (4Hirning U. Schmid P. Schutz A.W. Rettenberger G. Hameister H. Mech. Dev. 1991; 33: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In mice, N-myc expression is highest around E9.5, where expression is observed in early neural crest lineages, limb buds, and developing central nervous system (5Kato K. Kanamori A. Wakamatsu Y. Sawai S. Kondoh H. Dev. Growth Differ. 1991; 33: 29-36Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The expression of N-myc then declines in these tissues upon the onset of differentiation. The importance of N-myc in embryogenesis is demonstrated by the finding that homozygous N-myc null mice die around embryonic day 11.5 with abnormalities in the limb buds and in the central and peripheral nervous systems (6Sawai S. Shimono A. Wakamatsu Y. Palmes C. Hanaoka K. Kondoh H. Development. 1993; 117: 1445-1455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most notably, the N-myc-deficient embryos showed a great reduction in the number of mature neurons, especially those derived from the neural crest such as sensory and sympathetic neurons. These defects occurred despite compensatory c-Myc increases (7Stanton B.R. Perkins A.S. Tessarollo L. Sassoon D.A. Parada L.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2235-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), suggesting a unique role for N-Myc in development. To function, N-Myc, like c-Myc, must heterodimerize with Max proteins. Max proteins also contain a basic DNA binding domain and a helix loop helix and leucine zipper dimerization motif (8Blackwood M.E. Eisenman N.R. Science. 1991; 251: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). This heterodimerization is required for sequence specific DNA binding as well as for biological function. Myc-Max heterodimers recognize the core sequence CA(C/T)GTG, termed the E box Myc sequence. In both yeast and mammalian cells, Myc-Max complexes are capable of activating reporter gene constructs containing concatamerized E box Myc sites (9Facchini L.M. Penn L.Z. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 633-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar,10Luscher B. Larsson L.G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2955-29668Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In addition, Max proteins can also heterodimerize with Mad proteins that negatively regulate cell growth. Max-Mad complexes bind to the same E box motif as the Myc-Max complexes, but in contrast to Myc-Max complexes, they repress transcription (11Ayer D.E. Kretzner L. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1993; 72: 211-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Mad family members repress transcription through their association with the Sin3 proteins, which in turn recruit histone deacetylases to the complex (12Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The central member of the Myc/Max/Mad network is Max, which is very stable. In contrast, the expressions of both Myc and Mad proteins are highly regulated. The myc genes are actively transcribed in dividing cells, but little expression can be detected in quiescent or differentiated cells. By comparison, the Mad genes are usually expressed in resting or differentiated cells with little expression in dividing cells (13Chin L.N. Schreiber-Agus I. Pelicer K. Chen H. Lee M. Dudast C. Crdon-Cardo C. DePinto R.A. Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8488-8493Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A number of target genes for c-Myc have been identified. Many of the target genes that are up-regulated by c-Myc are either rate-limiting enzymes involved in the biosynthesis and metabolic production of polyamines and pyrimidines, such as ornithine decarboxylase (14Bello-Fernandez C. Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7804-7808Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) and cad (15Miltenberger R.J. Sukow K.A. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2527-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), or involved in cell cycle control such as cdc25a (16Galaktionov K. Chen X. Beach D. Nature. 1996; 382: 513-517Crossref Scopus (649) Google Scholar), ISGF3γ (17Weihua X. Lindner D.J. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genomics. 1991; 11: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) that have been shown to play a critical role in early embryogenesis. Disruption of the Pax-3 gene has been shown to lead to a range of developmental abnormalities including neural tube defects, a lack of limb musculature, and deficiencies in neural crest-derived cell types (20Russell W.L.

Pax-3, like N-myc, is first expressed during early embryogenesis within neural crest lineages, limb buds, and the developing nervous system. The expression of Pax-3 in these tissues is restricted to mitotically active progenitor cells and is rapidly down-regulated upon differentiation (25Goulding M.D. Chalepakis G. Deutsch U. Erselius J. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1992; 10: 1135-1147Crossref Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 26Reeves F.C. Fredericks W.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Lillycrop K.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Given the overlapping patterns of expression of N-myc and Pax-3, we have examined the relationship between N-Myc and Pax-3, and in this report we present evidence that Pax-3 is a direct transcriptional target of N-Myc and c-Myc. ND7, NIH3T3, and COS-7 cells were grown in full growth medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 1The abbreviations used are: DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; OHT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; RT, reverse transcriptase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. 10% bovine calf serum, and 2 mm glutamine. Neuroblastoma cell lines (IMR-32, Kelly, SK-N-SH, C1300, SHSY-5Y, SK-N-AS, SK-N-BE, and SK-N-DZ) were grown in DMEM, 10% bovine calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1% nonessential amino acids. To prepared stable cell lines expressing N-Myc, ND7 cells (5 × 105) were plated out on 58-cm2 dishes and transfected with an N-Myc expression vector (pMiwNmyc; 2 μg) together with 2 μg of pcDNA3.1, which carries the neomycin resistance marker. Stable transfectants were selected by supplementing the medium 48 h after transfection with 800 μg/ml G418. Independent clones were isolated after 1 week, when individual foci of cells were evident. These were then grown up and maintained in DMEM plus 10% serum containing 800 μg/ml G418. Cell lines expressing c-MycER were generated by transfecting ND7 cells with pBpuro c-MycER (27Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) and selecting for puromycin (5 μg/ml)-resistant clones. The retroviral vector pBpuro c-MycER comprises the c-myc coding sequences fused in frame to a modified ligand binding domain of the estrogen receptor. The fusion protein is activated by the addition of the synthetic ligand 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) but is refractory to 17β-estradiol. ND7 cells expressing c-MycER were passaged in DMEM plus 10% bovine calf serum and 1% charcoal-treated bovine calf serum for 48 h prior to Myc induction. To activate c-MycER, 100 nm OHT was added to the culture media for 4 h. This results in the translocation of the c-MycER fusion protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (data not shown). In transient transfection assays, NIH3T3, ND7, and COS-7 (5 × 105) cells were plated out on 58-cm2dishes and transfected as previously described (28Lillycrop K.A. Dent C.L. Wheatley S.C. Beech M.N. Ninkina N.N. Wood J.N. Latchman D.S. Neuron. 1991; 7: 381-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The transfection efficiency was normalized by co-transfecting cells with pCMV-β-gal. β-Galactosidase assays were performed according to the method of Gorman (29Gorman C. Glover D. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. 2. IRL Press, Oxford1980: 143-190Google Scholar). Quantitation of the CAT assay was achieved using a STORM PhosphorImager and then using an image quantifier program to calculate percentage conversions of the [14C]chloramphenicol to its acetylated products. For cell cycle analysis, transfected ND7 cells were placed in serum-free media for 24 h. Following serum starvation, the cells were either harvested or refed with media containing serum and incubated for the indicated time periods. Luciferase assays were performed using the Promega luciferase assay system. Nuclear extracts were made as described by Dignam et al. (30Dignam J.D. Lebobitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar), and the protein concentration of each sample was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Samples (20 μg of nuclear protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% resolving gel) using a Bio-Rad minigel apparatus. Proteins were transferred to a Hybond-P membrane and blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% dried milk powder, 0.02% Tween 20 in PBS. Membranes were incubated at room temperature for 1 h at room temperature in 5% dried milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline and a 1:2000 dilution of N-Myc or c-Myc antisera and washed in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.2% Tween 20. Membranes were then incubated in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.2% Tween 20 containing 5% dried milk powder with a 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h. Immunoreactive bands were then visualized using Ultrasignal (Pierce), and the intensities of the bands were quantitated using densitometry. All membranes were subsequently checked to ensure equal loading of samples by staining the membrane with Amido Black. Anti-c-Myc, -Max, -Mad, and -MyoD antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-N-Myc antibodies were from Calbiochem. Total cellular RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen), and RNA concentrations were determined by slot-blot hybridization. Conventional RT-PCR was carried out as described by Reeves et al. (26Reeves F.C. Fredericks W.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Lillycrop K.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), with gene-specific primers forPax-3 (5′-GGAATACAAAGAGAGAACCCG-3′ and 5′-CTTCATCTCACTGAGGTGCG-3′) and the housekeeping gene cyclophilin (5′-TTGGGTCGCGTCTGCTTCGA-3′ and 5′-GCCAGGACCTGTATGCTTCA-3′). For Taqman quantitative RT-PCR analysis, all equipment and reagents were supplied by Applied Biosystems. Taqman PCR primers and probes were designed using Primer Express software. (Pax-3 forward primer, 5′-GAGTGAGCGCGAGCCTCTGCAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AGGTGGTTCTGCTCCTGCG-3′; Taqman probe, 5′-AGGCTCCGTATTGACTCTGAACCTGATTTACC-3′). Primers and probes for the housekeeping gene 18 S ribosomal RNA were supplied by Applied Biosystems. Probes were labeled at the 5′-end with a 6′-carboxyfluorescein reporter dye and at the 3′-end with a 6′-carboxytetramethylrhodamine quencher dye. To test the primer pairs, conventional RT-PCR was used as described previously (26Reeves F.C. Fredericks W.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Lillycrop K.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and amplified products were confirmed by direct sequencing of the PCR. For Taqman PCR, cDNA was synthesized using 200 ng of total RNA in a 10-μl reaction volume using RTGold reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. Taqman PCR was performed with 1 μl (equivalent to 10 ng of input RNA) of cDNA template in a 25-μl PCR containing 100 nm primers, 50 nm probe in Universal Taqman master mix. Cycling conditions were 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min followed by a 40-cycle amplification cycle of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min on the Applied Biosystems PRISM 7700 sequence detection system. Samples were analyzed in duplicate and normalized to the measurement of the housekeeping gene as described by Bustin et al. (31Bustin S.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 169-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar). The Pax-3 promoter (−1578 to +56 bp) was amplified from MF1 mouse genomic DNA by PCR using the primers 5′-GAGCTCTAATGCTCCTCC-3′ and 5′-GGTGACGAGGCAGGAAC-3′ and AccuTaq (Sigma). The amplified fragment was cloned into pGem-T Easy (Promega) and sequenced. The Pax-3 promoter fragment was excised from pGem-T Easy with SphI and SalI and subcloned into pCATBasic (Promega) to create Pax3Cat or into pGL3Basic (Promega). Truncated promoter constructs were made by digesting Pax3CAT withSphI and either KpnI, SalI,AvaII, or XmaI. The digested vectors were then purified and religated to form dK (−970 to +56 bp), dS (−537 to +56 bp), dA (−155 to +56 bp), and dX (−93 to +56 bp). All clones were then sequenced to verify the construct. All deletion constructs used were able to drive expression of a reporter gene. The expression vectors containing N-myc (pmiwNmyc) and Max(pmiwMax) were a kind gift of H. Kondoh. The c-myc cDNA clone was obtained from M. Green and subcloned into pMisv. The vectors pBpuro and pBpuro cMycER were a kind gift from G. Evan. The putative E box sequence in the Pax-3 promoter was mutated from CGCGTG to CCGCGG using two-step PCR mutagenesis using the following primers: 5′-CCCAATCAGCCGCGGTCTTTGCCAC-3′ and 5′-GTGGCAAAGACCGCGGCTGATTGGG-3′. The sequence of all clones was verified by sequencing. Oligonucleotides for use in electrophoretic mobility shift assays were annealed by heating to 85 °C for 3 min and labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The oliognucleotides used were the Pax-3 E box Myc sequence (5′-GCCCAATCAGCGCGTGTCTTTGCCAC-3′), a consensus E box Myc sequence (5′-GGAAGCAGACCACGTGCTCTGCTTCC-3′), thecdc25 E box sequence (5′-ACTACACACGTGCCACCACACCCAA-3′), and a mutant E box Myc sequence (5′-GGAAGCAGACCACGGAGTCTGCTTCC-3′). Nuclear extracts were made using the method described by Dignam et al. (30Dignam J.D. Lebobitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out as previously described (26Reeves F.C. Fredericks W.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Lillycrop K.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Competitions were performed using a 10-, 50-, 100-, and 500-fold excess of unlabelled oligonucleotide, which was incubated with the nuclear extracts prior to the addition of the probe. To confirm the identity of the retarded complex, nuclear extracts were also incubated on ice for 4 h with 2 μl of 1 μg/ml specific antiserum prior to the addition of the probe. For cell cycle distribution, cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate, and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry (32Morasca L. Erba E. Freshney R.I. Animal Cell Culture: A Practical Approach. Oxford IRL Press, Oxford1986: 125-148Google Scholar) using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer. The analysis of cells in late G1 was confirmed by arresting cells at the G1/S border with Aphidicolin, and the analysis of G2/M cells was confirmed by arresting cells with hydroxyurea. For cell synchronization, cells were seeded onto 8.7-cm2 Petri dishes at a density of 2 × 104. Cells were then serum starved by the addition of DMEM plus 1 mm glutamine media for 24 h. Serum was then added back for 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 h, and samples were analyzed for DNA content, c-Myc and N-Myc protein levels, andPax-3 mRNA levels. To determine whether Pax-3 expression is regulated by N-Myc, the 5′ promoter region of the murine Pax-3 gene (bp −1578 to +56) was amplified by PCR from mouse genomic DNA and sequenced. This region of the Pax-3 promoter has been shown by Natoliet al. (33Natoli T.A. Ellsworth M.K., Wu, C. Gross K.W. Pruitt S.C. Development. 1997; 124: 617-626PubMed Google Scholar) to be sufficient for the correct induction ofPax-3 expression in vivo. For our experiments, the Pax-3 promoter (bp −1578 bp to +56) was then cloned upstream of the reporter gene CAT in the vector pCATbasic (Pax3CAT). The Pax-3 promoter construct was then transiently transfected into the fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 together with an expression vector containing either the full-length cDNA of the mouse N-myc gene or the full-length cDNA of the c-myc gene. CAT activity was measured 48 h later. All transient CAT assay values were normalized with a cotransfected cytomegalovirus-β galactosidase plasmid. We found that co-transfection of the Pax-3 promoter construct with either N-Myc or c-Myc led to the induction of Pax-3 promoter activity. N-Myc induced an 18-fold increase, whereas c-Myc induced an 8-fold increase in Pax-3 promoter activity (Fig.1, A and B). Co-transfection of the Pax-3 promoter with N-Myc and Max or c-Myc and Max led to a further increase in Pax-3 promoter activity. In contrast, co-transfection of Max alone with Pax-3CAT led to a small inhibition in Pax-3 promoter activity (Fig. 1,A and B). In addition, when the amounts of expression vectors for N-Myc-Max and c-Myc-Max were increased in a fixed Myc/Max ratio, expression of the Pax-3 promoter was further increased (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that members of the Myc family of transcription factors can activate Pax-3promoter activity in vitro. The expression of pCATbasic was unaffected by the addition of increasing amounts of N-Myc-Max or c-Myc-Max. Having shown that the Myc family of transcription factors is capable of regulating Pax-3expression in transient transfection assays, we next investigated whether this regulation was dependent on the direct binding of the Myc proteins to sites within the Pax-3 promoter. To test this, a series of truncated Pax-3 promoter constructs derived from the Pax-3CAT promoter construct (bp −1578 to +56) were generated (Fig.2 A). All truncated promoter constructs were able to direct basal gene expression, and we therefore examined the ability of N-Myc-Max and c-Myc-Max to activate each truncated construct. We found that all of the truncatedPax-3 promoter constructs were activated in the presence of both N-Myc and Max and c-Myc and Max, apart from the smallest construct, dX (−93 to +56 bp), which was no longer activated by either N-Myc-Max or c-Myc-Max (Fig. 2 B). This suggests that the sequences between −155 and −93 bp are essential for Myc regulation of Pax-3 expression. Computer analysis of this region of the Pax-3 promoter, using Matinspector, version 2.2, based on Transfac 4.0, revealed an inverted Myc E box binding site (CGCGTG) located −110/−105 bp upstream of the transcription start site (Fig. 2 C). Mutation of this site from CGCGTG to CCGCGG abolished the ability of N-Myc and Max or c-Myc and Max to activatePax-3 promoter activity (Fig. 2 D). To determine whether N-Myc-Max or c-Myc-Max heterodimers can bind to the E box site from the Pax-3 promoter, whole cell extracts from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with expression vectors containing N-Myc, c-Myc, and Max were incubated with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing the Pax-3 E box sequence, and DNA binding was assessed by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (34Sommer A. Bouset K. Kremmer E. Austen M. Luscher B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6632-6642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In COS-7 cells transfected with an empty expression vector, little binding to the Pax-3 E box site was observed. In COS-7 cells transfected with N-mycexpression vectors, no E box binding above that seen in control cells was observed (data not shown). However, when COS-7 cells were co-transfected with N-Myc and Max, one major retarded complex was seen together with a very weak high mobility complex (Fig.3 A). In COS-7 cells transfected with both N-Myc and Max, the major retarded complex was disrupted by both N-Myc and Max antibodies, suggesting that this major E box complex represents N-Myc-Max binding to the Pax-3 E box sequence. The weaker complex, however, was disrupted only by antibodies against Max, suggesting that this weak E box binding represents Max homodimer binding (Fig. 3 B). The faster migrating E box complex was also observed in lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with Max-containing expression vectors, which is consistent with this complex representing Max homodimer binding. We also found that c-Myc, like N-Myc, could not bind to the E box motif alone, but, when transfected with Max, binding was observed. These experiments suggest that Max homodimers and N-Myc-Max and c-Myc-Max heterodimers can bind to the Pax-3 E box motif in vitro. To compare the binding affinity of N-Myc-Max and c-Myc-Max for the Pax-3 E box motif, competition assays were performed using the consensus E box Myc sequence (CACGTG), the E box site from thecdc25 gene, or a mutant E box site. In these experiments, the radiolabeled Pax-3 E box oligonucleotide was used as a probe with extracts from COS-7 cells, transfected with either N-Myc-Max or c-Myc-Max, and incubated with a 10-, 50-, 100-, or 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide. The addition of a 500-fold excess of the cold Pax-3 E box site reduced binding by 85 and 61% with N-Myc-Max and c-Myc-Max, respectively (Fig. 3, C andD). The consensus E box motif and the E box site from thecdc25 gene were able to effectively compete out N-Myc-Max and c-Myc-Max binding, although both the consensus E box and thecdc25 E box site were more effective in binding out c-Myc-Max rather than N-Myc-Max binding. An oligonucleotide containing a mutated Pax-3 E box site was not able to effectively compete out N-Myc-Max or c-Myc-Max binding to the probe (Fig. 3, C andD). These experiments demonstrate that both N-Myc-Max and c-Myc-Max heterodimers can effectively bind to the E box motif in thePax-3 promoter, although N-Myc-Max heterodimers appear to bind to the Pax-3 E box site with greater affinity than c-Myc-Max. Having shown that transiently transfected N-Myc-Max and c-Myc-Max heterodimers can bind to the Pax-3 E box motif in COS-7 cells, the Pax-3 E box sequence was examined for potential binding to Myc-Max heterodimers in the ND7 cell line. To examine this, nuclear extracts were prepared from the ND7 cell line. These cells proliferate indefinitely in the presence of serum, but upon serum starvation, the cells undergo cell cycle arrest and morphologically differentiate into a mature neuronal-like phenotype. Dividing ND7 cells expressPax-3 mRNA, but upon differentiation, the level ofPax-3 declines. We found when nuclear extracts from dividing ND7 cells were incubated with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing the Pax-3 E box site and analyzed by EMSA, one low mobility E box-binding protein was observed (Fig.4 A). Moreover, this binding was specific, since E box binding was competed out by an excess of oligonucleotide containing the E box site but not by an oligonucleotide containing a mutant E box consensus sequence. Furthermore, the addition of antibodies raised against N-Myc and Max dramatically reduced biding. Interestingly, the addition of antibodies raised against c-Myc also reduced binding (Fig. 4 B). Since the c-Myc antibody is specific for c-Myc and does not cross-react with other members of this family (data not shown), this suggests that in dividing ND7 cells, the E box site within the Pax-3 promoter is bound by a combination of N-Myc-Max and c-Myc-Max complexes. Western blot analysis confirmed that ND7 cells express both N-Myc and c-Myc proteins (see Fig. 7). In contrast, antibodies against Mad or MyoD, had no effect on E box binding (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, in serum-starved ND7 cells, little c-Myc-Max binding to the E box site was observed (Fig.4 C).Figure 7Pax-3 mRNA expression oscillates during the cell cycle. ND7 cells were synchronized by serum starvation for 24 h. The cells were then released from the cell cycle block by the addition of serum, and cells were analyzed 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 h after the addition of serum for the level of N-Myc and c-Myc protein expression by Western blot analysis (A), forPax-3 and cyclophilin mRNA expression by RT-PCR (B), and for the percentage of cells in G0/G1, S, or G2/M phase at the indicated time points (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Having shown that N-Myc and c-Myc can regulatePax-3 promoter activity, we next examined the possibility that Pax-3 expression may be regulated by members of the Myc family of transcription factors in vivo. If Pax-3is a target gene of N-Myc, then expression of Pax-3 mRNA would be expected to be altered in cell lines encoding an amplifiedNMYC gene. We therefore analyzed the expression ofPax-3 mRNA in a range of neuroblastoma cell lines containing either a single copy NMYC gene (SK-N-SH, C1300, SHSY-5Y, and SK-N-AS) or an amplified NMYC gene (IMR-32, Kelly, SK-N-DZ, and SK-N-BE) (2Schwab M. Altato K. Klempnauer K.H. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. Gibert F. Brodeur G. Goldstein M. Trent J. Nature. 1983; 316: 245-248Crossref Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). We found, as shown in Fig.5 A, that all cell lines expressed detectable levels of NMYC protein, with the highest levels of NMYC being detected in Kelly, IMR-32, SK-N-DZ, and SK-N-BE cell lines. These are the cell lines with an amplified NMYC gene. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that levels of Pax-3mRNA correlated with levels of NMYC protein, with Kelly and IMR-32 cells expressing the highest levels of Pax-3 mRNA; SK-N-BE and SK-N-DZ cell lines expressing intermediate levels ofPax-3 mRNA; and the lowest levels of Pax-3mRN"
https://openalex.org/W2329179976,"Estrogens stimulate proliferation of estrogen receptor positive MCF7 breast cancer cells while antiestrogens signal a G0/G1 growth arrest. In MCF7 cells, arrest is mediated through the CDK inhibitors p21 and p27 and through a decrease in cyclin E/CDK2 kinase activity. We found that in MCF7 cells, overexpression of cyclin E partially abrogates a tamoxifen mediated growth arrest. Overexpression of cyclin E is accompanied by a decrease in the levels of RB and CDK inhibitor p21 but an increase in CDK inhibitor p27. Cyclin E overexpression also alters the composition of E2F transcription factor complexes. The E2F4/p107/cyclin E/CDK2 complex, a minor component in proliferating control cells that is absent in growth-arrested cells, is more abundant in both proliferating and tamoxifen treated cyclin E overexpressing cells. Conversely, levels of the quiescence associated E2F/p130 complex is not detected in these cells. Expression from the E2F dependant promoter is elevated in proliferating and tamoxifen treated cyclin E overexpressing cells. This study suggests that a modest overexpression of cyclin E abrogates the tamoxifen mediated growth arrest through modification of the RB/E2F pathway. Moreover, these results provide one explanation of why some cells that express the estrogen receptor may be unresponsive to antiestrogens."
https://openalex.org/W2011537456,"Regulation of flagellar activity inChlamydomonas involves both Ca2+ and cAMP-mediated signaling pathways. However, Chlamydomonasand sea urchin sperm flagella also exhibit nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDK) activity, suggesting a requirement for GTP within this highly conserved organelle. In sea urchin sperm, the NDK catalytic subunit is an integral component of the outer dynein arm. Here we describe a modular protein (p72) from the Chlamydomonasflagellum that consists of three domains closely related to the presumptive regulatory segment of rat NDK-7 followed by two EF-hands that are predicted to bind Ca2+. There are close homologues of p72 in both mammalian and insect genomes. The p72 protein is tightly associated with the flagellar axoneme and is located along the entire length except at the transition zone. Cross-linking experiments suggest that p72 interacts with two or three additional axonemal polypeptides. The sensitivity of p72 to tryptic digestion differed considerably in the presence and the absence of Ca2+, suggesting that it indeed binds this ligand. These studies indicate that the flagellar NDK system is bipartite with the regulatory and catalytic components residing on different polypeptides.

Ciliated epithelia are involved in fluid transport in many organs such as the trachea and oviduct, whereas the beating of flagella powers the movement of single cells such as sperm and Chlamydomonas. Modified cilia act as mechanosensory receptors in Caenorhabditis elegans and as photoreceptors in mammals. Recently, embryonic nodal cilia, which beat with a vortical pattern, have been implicated in the establishment of left-right asymmetry during mammalian development (1Okada Y. Nonaka S. Tanaka Y. Saijoh Y. Hamada H. Hirokawa N. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 459-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 2Supp D.M. Witte D.P. Potter S.S. Brueckner M. Nature. 1997; 389: 963-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). This complex organelle is built around nine outer doublet microtubules and a central pair of singlet microtubules. Other clearly defined components include the inner and outer rows of dynein arms that provide the power for flagellar motility, the radial spokes that convert microtubule sliding to bending, and the sheath structures surrounding the central singlet microtubules. There is a complex regulatory signaling system built into the flagellar axoneme that is required for spatial and temporal control of motor activity and ultimately leads to the generation and propagation of a flagellar wave (see Refs. 3Mitchell D.R. J. Phycol. 2000; 36: 261-273Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar and 4Porter M.E. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: F37-F42Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholarfor reviews). However, many of the details of this regulation, and indeed the nature of the signals themselves, remain incompletely understood. Although the Chlamydomonas flagellar axoneme is stable when isolated, the flagellum is a dynamic organelle in vivo that is constantly being dismantled and rebuilt at the distal tip (5Marshall W.F. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In this process, axonemal components are transported distally by intraflagellar transport and presumably off-loaded and incorporated once they have reached the assembly site (6Kozminski K.G.

Furthermore, the constant reassembly of flagellar microtubules from tubulin dimers requires either dimers preloaded with GTP in the cell body or a flagellar source of GTP. Cellular GTP is obtained through the transfer of the terminal γ-phosphate from ATP to GDP by the action of nucleoside-diphosphate kinase. Multiple NDKs1 with both catalytic and presumptive regulatory or targeting domains have been identified in many organisms, and a microtubule-associated NDK has been described (9Nickerson J.A.

Chem. 1976; 251: 182-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the Chlamydomonas flagellum contains a nucleoside-diphosphate kinase activity that showed significant preference for purine nucleotides and thus could readily provide a flagellar source of GTP; other NTPs were also generated but at slower rates. In sea urchin sperm flagella, the catalytic domain of NDK has been identified in the IC1 polypeptide, which is an integral component of sea urchin sperm outer arm dynein tightly associated with the β heavy chain (11Ogawa K. Takai H. Ogiwara A. Yokota E. Shimizu T. Inaba K. Mohri H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1895-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). IC1 is a modular protein containing an N-terminal thioredoxin segment followed by three NDK catalytic domains and a unique C-terminal region. The presence of these modules suggests a requirement for GTP either directly by dynein and/or by other axonemal components. A homologue of IC1 (termed Sptrx-2) has recently been identified in mammalian sperm (12Sadek C.M. Damdimopoulos A.E. Pelto-Huikko M. Gustafsson J.A. Spyrou G. Miranda-Vizuete A. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 1077-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Analysis ofChlamydomonas flagellar dyneins has revealed the presence of two thioredoxin-related LCs within the outer dynein arm (13Patel-King R.S. Benashki S.E. Harrison A. King S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6283-6291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) similar to those identified in IC1 (11Ogawa K. Takai H. Ogiwara A. Yokota E. Shimizu T. Inaba K. Mohri H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1895-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and we recently demonstrated that the enzymatic activity of one outer arm heavy chain can be regulated by altering the redox state of specific sulfhydryl moieties (14Harrison A. Sakato M. Tedford H.W. Benashski S.E. Patel-King R.S. King S.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 2002; 52: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, a Chlamydomonas dynein polypeptide with NDK catalytic activity similar to that of sea urchin IC1 has not been described. Because NDKs have been identified in sea urchin sperm dynein, suggesting a requirement for GTP in dynein function, and because the flagellum is such a highly conserved structure that clearly requires NDKase activity for maintenance and assembly, we sought to identify these components within Chlamydomonas. Here we describe a modular protein that is a major component of theChlamydomonas flagellum. This molecule consists of three segments related to the N-terminal domain of rat NDK-7 followed by two EF-hands that are predicted to bind Ca2+. Furthermore, examination of the Chlamydomonas EST data base has identified two catalytic NDKs within this organism, only one of which is likely to be involved in flagellar activity. Together these results suggest that the Chlamydomonas flagellum contains a bipartite Ca2+-controlled NDK system for generating GTP (or other NTPs), where the regulatory and catalytic components are located on different polypeptides. This raises the possibility that GTP acts as an important mediator of a Ca2+-initiated signaling pathway. Wild typeChlamydomonas reinhardtii (strain 1132D) and mutant strainsoda9, ida1, ida4, pf14, andpf18 lacking the outer dynein arms, inner arm I1, inner arm I2, radial spokes, and central pair complex, respectively, were grown in minimal medium (15Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989: 25-29Crossref Google Scholar). After harvesting, the cells were deflagellated with dibucaine. The resulting flagella were isolated by standard methods and demembranated with 1% Nonidet P-40 (16Witman G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 17King S.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 47: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The axonemes were either prepared directly for gel electrophoresis or further fractionated by extraction with 0.6 m NaCl (18King S.M. Otter T. Witman G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Tryptic digests of axonemal proteins were performed in the presence of either 1 mm Ca2+ or 1 mm EGTA. Protease digestion was terminated by the addition of gel sample buffer and heating. Wild type axonemes were treated with 0.6 mNaCl, and the resulting insoluble axonemal remnant was then extracted with 4 m urea. The NDK-related protein subsequently was purified by reverse phase chromatography on a C4 column. Following electrophoresis and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon Psq, Millipore, Woburn, MA), the protein band was stained with Amido Black, excised, and digested with trypsin in situ. Individual peptides were purified by reverse phase chromatography on a C18 column and sequenced at the Protein Chemistry Facility of the University of Massachusetts Medical School. An ∼300-bp product encoding a portion of the NDK-related protein was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR from Chlamydomonas RNA enriched for flagellar messages using primers designed from the peptide sequences. This product was subsequently used to obtain an ∼10-kb genomic clone from a Chlamydomonas library made in λDashII. Sequences were assembled using the GCG suite of software. Northern and Southern blotting was performed using standard methods (19King S.M. Patel-King R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11445-11452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The nucleotide and protein data bases were searched using BLAST. Multiple alignments were performed with CLUSTALW. COMPARE and PROSITE were used for dotplot analysis and motif identification, respectively. The sequence encoding residues 411–622 was obtained by PCR from the genomic clone and inserted into the pMAL-c2 expression vector between the XmnI andXbaI sites. This resulted in fusion of the 411–622-peptide region to the C terminus of maltose-binding protein via a hydrophilic linker region containing a Factor Xa protease site. The entire fusion protein was used as the immunogen for antibody production in rabbit CT138. An antibody fraction that reacts specifically with the NDK-related protein was obtained from serum by blot purification against the recombinant peptide (20Olmsted J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To detect interacting proteins, purified axonemes were treated with 0–10 mm dimethylpimelimidate in 0.2 m triethanolamine, pH 8.2, for 60 min at room temperature in the presence and the absence of Ca2+. The reactions were terminated by the addition of Tris·HCl-containing sample buffer. The samples were separated in 5–15% acrylamide gradient SDS gels and either stained with Coomassie Blue or blotted to nitrocellulose and probed with the CT138 antibody. Antibody reactivity was detected using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Log phase cells were attached to polylysine-coated coverslips and fixed in methanol at −20 °C for 20 min. The coverslips were blocked with 3% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline and then probed with blot-purified CT138. Following incubation with an Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500), the coverslips were mounted in Prolong antifade solution (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and sealed. The micrographs were taken on an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped for epifluorescence using an Optronics Magnafire camera. Chlamydomonas flagellar axonemes were initially extracted with 0.6 m NaCl to remove dynein arms and associated components. Subsequently, the salt-extracted axonemes were incubated in 4 m urea, the axonemal remnant was removed by centrifugation, and the resulting extract was fractionated by reverse phase HPLC on a C4 column. Three peptide sequences were obtained from the peak indicated in Fig. 1a; the adjacent peak contained solubilized tubulin. Examination of theChlamydomonasEST data base using these peptides revealed a series of overlapping clones (AV392229,AV396026, AV626093, AV642481, BE337482, BE725926, BE726492) that were assembled to form an ∼2.6-kb sequence (Fig. 1b) encoding a protein (termed p72) of 635 residues with a mass of 71,985 Da and a predicted pI of 7.59. The assembled cDNA contained all three peptide sequences (40 of 40 residues correct). The open reading frame is preceded by an 87-bp 5′-untranslated region with two in-frame termination codons and ends with a 625-bp 3′-untranslated region that includes a perfect copy of the putative Chlamydomonaspolyadenylation signal (Fig. 1c). To ensure that this assembled sequence was indeed correct, we used primers designed from the peptide sequences to obtain an ∼300-bp PCR product for use as a probe to isolate a large >10-kb genomic clone from aChlamydomonas genomic library made in λDashII. Sequence analysis of a 5.2-kb region derived from NotI andXbaI subclones identified five exons, suggesting that the entire 10-kb genomic clone contained the complete p72 gene and confirmed the peptide coding sequence obtained from analysis of the cDNAs (Fig. 2a). The first ∼2 kb of the p72 genomic clone also contains part of another gene defined by the EST BE441556, which encodes a homologue of a hypothetical murine protein (P(n) = 9 × 10−43).Figure 2Analysis of the p72 gene.a, a map of the NotI and XbaI subclones that contain most of the p72 genomic region is shown. This entire segment was sequenced to confirm the assembled cDNA shown in Fig. 1. A second gene exemplified by the BE441556 EST is located at the 5′ end of the clone.b, Southern blot of Chlamydomonas genomic DNA digested with BamHI, PstI, PvuII, andSmaI. Single bands were observed in PstI- andPvuII-digested samples, indicating that there is a single gene for p72 in Chlamydomonas. c, Northern blot of total RNA obtained from nondeflagellated cells (NDF) and from cells that had been deflagellated and allowed to regrow flagella for 30 min (30′ postDF). A single message of ∼3 kb that was highly up-regulated in deflagellated cells was observed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To locate the p72 gene on the Chlamydomonas genetic map, the 3′-untranslated region of p72 was used to identify three large BAC clones (17k3, 24g19, and 27p11) that had previously been found to contain the S6–175 mRNA (21Schloss J.A. Silflow C.D. Rosenbaum J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This mRNA, and thus the p72 gene, is located on linkage group II (22Silfow C.D. Rochaix J.-D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1998: 25-40Google Scholar), within 3 cm of the centromere (23Ranum L.P. Thompson M.D. Schloss J.A. Lefebvre P.A. Silflow C.D. Genetics. 1988; 120: 109-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis (Fig. 2b) indicates that there is one gene for p72 in Chlamydomonas. A single ∼3-kb message was detected in RNA samples derived from cells actively regenerating flagella and thus enriched for flagellar sequences (Fig.2c). No message was observed in uninduced cells. Sequence analysis using BLAST revealed that there are clear homologues of p72 in both mammalian and insect genomes (Fig.3a). The probability scores for comparison with the human (FLJ10466), mouse (AK006489), andDrosophila (AAF48513) proteins are 9 × 10−97, 5 × 10−98, and 9 × 10−42, respectively. The EST data base also contains proteins from zebrafish olfactory epithelium (AW232717) and sea urchin primary mesenchyme (SEAUMC003516) that share significant similarity with p72 (not shown). A PROSITE search of p72 revealed multiple putative phosphorylation sites and five other discrete motifs (Fig. 3b). Much of the molecule consists of three domains (residues 117–196, 260–384, and 440–549) that share considerable homology with part of rat NDK-7; the short intervening regions contain no obvious homologies or motifs. A more detailed dotplot analysis indicated that these three p72 modules are related to the N-terminal (noncatalytic) region of NDK-7 (Fig.4a). In contrast, IC1 from sea urchin outer arm dynein contains three NDK catalytic modules (11Ogawa K. Takai H. Ogiwara A. Yokota E. Shimizu T. Inaba K. Mohri H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1895-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The homology of these sea urchin IC1 domains with NDK-7 begins very close to where homology with the p72-related regions terminates (Fig.4a). The C-terminal ∼50 residues of p72 contain two motifs (residues 581–593 and 617–629) that conform precisely to the 12-residue EF-hand consensus for Ca2+-binding loops (Fig.4b). These regions are predicted to coordinate the metal with a pentagonal bipyramidal ligand sphere. Both motifs contain the highly conserved Asp and Ser/Asn residues at positions 1 and 3, the invariant Asp/Glu at position 12 that provides a bidentate ligand to Ca2+, and also the Gly at position 6 that is found in many EF-hand proteins. To further analyze the properties of p72, the region encoding residues 411–622 was obtained from the genomic clone by PCR and expressed as a C-terminal fusion with maltose-binding protein. The boundaries of the p72 fragment used were dictated by the intron-exon structure of the gene and include the third NDK module, all of the first EF-hand, and most of the second one. The entire fusion protein was used to immunize rabbit CT138, and the resulting serum was blot-purified against the recombinant p72 (411–622) segment following separation from maltose-binding protein by digestion with Factor Xa (Fig.5a). When used to probe immunoblots of Chlamydomonas axonemes, one major band with an Mr of 66,000 corresponding to p72 was detected (Fig. 5b). Densitometry indicates that this band accounts for ∼1% of total axonemal protein. After prolonged exposure, several additional minor bands also were observed; the identity of these proteins is unknown, although several bands of lowerMr likely represent minor endogenous proteolytic fragments (see below). To determine the location of p72, flagella were extracted first with detergent to yield demembranated axonemes plus a membrane and matrix fraction (Fig. 5c). The p72 protein was found exclusively in the axonemal fraction, indicating that it is not a membrane or soluble flagellar matrix component. Subsequently, axonemes were treated with 0.6 m NaCl, which solubilized essentially all dynein arms as well as many other components. Immunological analysis revealed that only a small fraction of p72 could be extracted under high salt conditions; most remained tightly bound to the axonemal remnant (Fig.5c). To further define the localization of p72, axonemes were prepared from a series of mutants that lack outer arms (oda9), inner arm I1 (ida1), inner arm I2 (ida4), radial spokes (pf14), and the central pair microtubule complex (pf18) (Fig. 6). These samples were then probed with the CT138 antibody (Fig. 6). All of the mutants contained apparently wild type amounts of p72, strongly suggesting that this protein is not an integral component of these major axonemal complexes. Furthermore, because p72 is only poorly extracted with 0.6 m NaCl, it is unlikely to be a component of inner arm I3 that is salt-extractable. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that p72 is not concentrated at specific locations within the axoneme but rather is arrayed alone the entire length of both flagella (Fig. 7). Interestingly, p72 appears to be lacking from the very proximal region of the flagellum, which contains the transition zone. There is also a considerable amount of p72 present in the cytoplasm immediately surrounding the nucleus and near the base of the flagella.Figure 7Immunofluorescence localization of p72.Wild type Chlamydomonas were attached to a coverslip with polylysine, fixed in methanol, and probed with blot-purified CT138 followed by an Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody. In many cases, the flagella pair became separated from the cell body. Differential interference contrast images are shown in a andc, and the corresponding fluorescence images are inb and d. The p72 protein is present along almost the entire length of both flagella. However, it is missing from the region of the flagellum immediately adjacent to the cell body. Considerable amounts of p72 also are present in the cell body near the nucleus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ca2+-binding proteins often show different proteolytic digestion patterns upon ligand binding caused by changes in protein conformation and the consequent alteration in accessibility of protease-sensitive sites. Therefore, to assess whether the EF-hands in p72 bind Ca2+, we subjected p72 to tryptic digestionin situ in the presence of either 1 mmCa2+ or 1 mm EGTA (Fig.8). Although there was no significant difference observed in the masses of the products generated, a distinct alteration in sensitivity to proteolysis was found such that in the absence of Ca2+, 10-fold more protease was required to obtain equivalent levels of digestion during the initial stages of the experiment. This suggests that p72 indeed changes conformation upon Ca2+ binding. To assess what proteins p72 may be closely associated with in situ, we employed a chemical cross-linking approach using dimethylpimelimidate, which has a 9.2 Å linker length and covalently links primary amines. The three smallest cross-linked products hadMr values of 116,000, 97,000, and 85,000, respectively (Fig. 9). TheMr 116,000 product and p72 have a mass difference of ∼50 kDa, raising the possibility that this cross-linked species derives from the attachment of tubulin. Multiple higher order structures also were observed that are consistent with this interpretation. Unfortunately, so many tubulin-containing species are generated under these cross-linking conditions that it was not feasible to test this hypothesis directly. The mass of the other cross-linked products suggests interaction with proteins of ∼13 and ∼25 kDa (or possibly two of the smaller species). All of these products were generated in both the presence and the absence of Ca2+ (not shown), suggesting that they derive from structural associations within the axoneme rather than Ca2+-regulated interactions. In Chlamydomonas, Ca2+ signaling is required to mediate both phototaxis and the photoshock response (24Witman G.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 403-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar,25Kamiya R. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Phototaxis involves differential alterations in beat frequency of the two flagella following submicromolar changes in Ca2+levels and allows the cell to steer toward or away from a light source. The avoidance or photoshock response is initiated by an increase in intraflagellar Ca2+ from 10−6 to 10−4m and leads to an alteration in flagellar waveform from an asymmetric to a symmetric pattern and the consequent reversal of swimming direction. These observations suggest that the flagellum contains at least two distinct sensors that respond to different Ca2+ levels. Several candidates for the photoshock sensor have been identified including calmodulin (26Van Eldik L.J. Piperno G. Watterson D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4779-4783Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27Gitelman S.E. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 764-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), inner arm-associated centrin (28Piperno G. Ramanis Z. Smith E.F. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 29Huang B. Mengersen A. Lee V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), the outer dynein arm proteins LC4, which is associated with the γ heavy chain (30King S.M. Patel-King R.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3757-3764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and DC3, a component of the outer arm docking complex (31Casey D.M. Pazour G.J. Wilkerson C.G. Inaba K. Koutoulis A. Takada S. Kamiya R. Witman G.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9 (abstr.): 155Google Scholar). All of these proteins contain EF-hands and most are known to bind Ca2+ directly. Indeed, regulation of ATP-dependent dynein-microtubule interactions mediated by Ca2+ binding to LC4 has recently been identified (32Sakato M. King S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12 (abstr.): 313Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that Ca2+signaling within the flagellum may also control the synthesis of GTP. The p72 polypeptide is a major component of the flagellar axoneme and is located throughout the entire structure except apparently in the transition zone immediately adjacent to the cell body. Mutant analysis revealed that wild type levels of p72 were present in strains lacking dynein arms, radial spokes, and the central pair complex. Furthermore, p72 is tightly bound to the microtubular axoneme, and only small amounts could be extracted by treatment with 0.6 m NaCl. Molecular cloning identified three modules closely related to the N-terminal regulatory region of rat NDK-7 within p72. This result is intriguing because it parallels the modular arrangement of three catalytic NDK domains within the IC1 polypeptide of sea urchin outer arm dynein (11Ogawa K. Takai H. Ogiwara A. Yokota E. Shimizu T. Inaba K. Mohri H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1895-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Indeed, the region of NDK-7 to which p72 is related is immediately N-terminal to the catalytic domains present in IC1. The p72 protein also contains two helix-loop-helix motifs at the C terminus that conform precisely to the EF-hand consensus sequence and are predicted to bind Ca2+. Proteolysis of native p72in situ revealed a significant difference in sensitivity to digestion in the presence and absence of Ca2+, suggesting that the p72 protein indeed undergoes conformational changes upon Ca2+ binding. These observations suggest that the NDK regulatory activity of p72 forms part of a Ca2+ signaling pathway. The Chlamydomonas flagellum contains very significant NDKase activity (10Watanabe T. Flavin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 182-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This activity could be separated into two distinct enzyme pools. One species sedimented at 2 S and was found only in flagellar samples; intriguingly, much of this flagellar NDKase activity could not be solubilized. The second NDK pool (∼4.3 S) present in flagella samples appeared identical to cytosolic NDK and was considered likely to derive from cell bodies contaminating the flagellar preparation. This suggestion was supported by the observation that the 4.3 S NDK did not increase during flagellar regeneration, whereas the 2 S species did (10Watanabe T. Flavin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 182-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently identified in the EST data base two additional Chlamydomonas proteins related to the catalytic NDK domain. 2R. S. Patel-King, S. E. Benashski, and S. M. King, unpublished observations. One of these NDKs is closely related to mammalian NDK-5 and NDK-7 and to the three NDK domains from sea urchin IC1. Furthermore, the 2.0-kb mRNA for this Chlamydomonas NDK is significantly up-regulated following deflagellation, which is characteristic of flagellar components. The other Chlamydomonas catalytic NDK is grouped with plant chloroplast enzymes. Thus, in the Chlamydomonasflagellum, the regulatory and catalytic domains found in enzymes such as rat NDK-7 reside on different polypeptides. On this basis, we present a model (Fig. 10) for how Ca2+ signals might result in enhanced flagellar GTP synthesis. This model predicts that the catalytic NDK unit is inactive when bound to p72 in the same way that association of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with its regulatory subunit leaves that enzyme inactive. Upon Ca2+ binding, we observed a conformational change that rendered p72 more susceptible to proteolysis. We suggest that this structural alteration leads to the release and activation of the catalytic subunit and consequently to the synthesis of GTP. The studies of Watanabe and Flavin (10Watanabe T. Flavin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 182-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) clearly demonstrated thatChlamydomonas flagella contain enzyme systems for generating nucleotides other than ATP. The flagellar-specific NDK described in that study exhibited a strong preference for purines, suggesting that the nucleotide generated in vivo is GTP. Our results indicate that the control mechanism for this activity is itself Ca2+-regulated. Why might GTP be required in the flagellum? One possibility is that a rise in GTP levels controls particular flagellar activities through binding to specific GTP-binding proteins. This hypothesis would allow for discrete intraflagellar signaling pulses, which would be limited by the duration of the Ca2+signal and the inherent GTPase activity of the target protein(s). There is currently no information on whether certain flagellar components exhibit a strong preference for binding nucleotides other than ATP. Cross-linking with the amine-specific reagent dimethylpimelimidate revealed a series of products containing p72. The same products were generated in both the presence and the absence of Ca2+. One had a mass ∼50 kDa greater than p72, raising the possibility that it derived from direct attachment to tubulin. Alternatively, we have observed that the catalytic NDK present in the flagellum is encoded by an mRNA of 2.0 kb, implying that this protein also may be ∼50 kDa. Two additional cross-linked products of 85 and 97 kDa containing p72 also were obtained. This suggests that in addition to the ∼50-kDa protein, p72 interacts either with proteins of ∼13 and 25 kDa or possibly with two ∼13-kDa species. Thus, p72 is clearly involved in multiple protein-protein interactions in situ. Closely related homologues of Chlamydomonas p72 were found in both mammalian and insect genomes. Examination of the EST data base identified these homologues in a wide variety of mammalian cell and tissue types that bear cilia or flagella, including testis, lung epithelia, and fetal brain. Although the metazoan proteins contain three domains related to the N terminus of rat NDK-7, they have different C termini and do not include the two Ca2+-binding EF-hands, suggesting that sensitivity to Ca2+ signals is specific to Chlamydomonas. In this report, we described the regulatory component of a bipartite NDK system within the Chlamydomonas flagellum. We are currently characterizing the NDK catalytic subunit and attempting to identify the downstream flagellar targets that specifically bind GTP. We thank Carolyn Silflow, Paul Lefebvre, William Brazelton, and Matthew LaVoie (University of Minnesota) for mapping the p72 gene."

The synthesis of GSH from its constituent amino acids involves two ATP-requiring enzymatic steps: the formation of γ-glutamylcysteine from glutamate and cysteine, and formation of GSH from γ-glutamylcysteine and glycine. The first step of GSH biosynthesis is generally regarded as rate-limiting and catalyzed by glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL, 1The abbreviations used are: GCL, glutamate-cysteine ligase; AP-1, activator protein 1; ARE, antioxidant response element; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GCLC, GCL-catalytic subunit; GCLM, GCL-modifier subunit; GS, GSH synthetase; MZF1, myeloid zinc finger 1; NF1, nuclear factor 1; NFκB, nuclear factor kappa B; Nrf2, nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2; TBH, tert-butylhydroquinone; ANOVA, analysis of variance. also known as γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase), whereas the second step is catalyzed by GSH synthetase (GS) (1Lu S.C. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1169-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). The GCL enzyme is composed of a catalytic (GCLC, M r ∼73,000) and a modifier (GCLM,M r ∼30,000) subunit that are encoded by different genes and dissociate under reducing conditions (4Yan N. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1588-1593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Huang C. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol.

The catalytic subunit exhibits all of the catalytic activity of the isolated enzyme as well as feedback inhibition by GSH (6Seelig G.F. Simondsen R.P. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9345-9347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The modifier subunit is enzymatically inactive but plays an important regulatory function by lowering the K m values of GCL for glutamate and raising the K i value for GSH (5Huang C. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20578-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Huang C. Chang L. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because GCL is a major determinant of the overall GSH synthesis capacity, regulation of GCL subunits has been a topic of extensive research (1Lu S.C. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1169-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Changes in GCL activity can result from regulation at multiple levels affecting only the catalytic or modifier subunit or both. Both human and rat GCL promoters have been cloned (8Mulcahy R.T.

Antioxidant response element (ARE, also known as electrophile-response element) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) are two cis-acting elements present in the promoter of both human GCL subunits that have been implicated in their transcriptional regulation by oxidants and β-naphthoflavone (1Lu S.C. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1169-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 8Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol.

In contrast, the cloned 5′-flanking regions of the rat GCL subunits do not contain AREs but contain both AP-1 and nuclear factor κB (NFκB) consensus binding sites (11Yang H.P. Huang Z.Z. Wang J.H., Ou, X.P. Lu S, C. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,12Yang H.P. Wang J.H., Ou, X.P. Huang Z.Z. Lu S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although much is known about GCL regulation, little attention has been paid to GS. The gene encoding GS was cloned in 1995 (13Huang C.S., He, W. Meister A. Anderson M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but its transcriptional regulation is poorly understood. By using treatments that are known to influence the expression of hepatic GCL subunits, we found that treatments such as tert-butylhydroquinone (TBH), diethyl maleate, and buthionine sulfoximine, which increase the expression of both subunits in rat hepatocytes, also increased the expression of GS (14Huang Z.Z. Yang H.P. Chen C.J. Lu S.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Increased GS expression further enhanced the capacity of the cell to synthesize GSH. In order to better understand transcriptional regulation of GS, we have cloned and characterized a 2.2-kb 5′-flanking region of the rat GS. In this report, we also examined the mechanism of coordinate induction of rat GCL subunits and GS by TBH. Cell culture media and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen. The Luciferase Assay System and the β-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). All restriction enzymes were obtained from either Promega or Invitrogen. [32P]dCTP and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Total RNA isolation kit was obtained from Invitrogen. All other reagents were of analytical grade and were obtained from commercial sources. An oligonucleotide probe corresponding to −38 to +2 of the rat GS cDNA (13Huang C.S., He, W. Meister A. Anderson M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) was used to screen the rat genomic library EMBL 3 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Ten positive plaques were selected; DNA was isolated and digested with EcoRI. The insert fragment was subcloned into pGL-3 enhancer vector (Promega) and sequenced in both directions using the automated ABI Prism dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencer performed by the Sequencing Core Facility, Norris Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California. The initial primers were universal primers for the pGL-3 enhancer vector, and all subsequent primers were nested primers designed using the available sequence information and the MacVector software program. The nucleotide sequence was verified by multiple bi-directional sequencing reactions. Sequences were aligned, and a consensus sequence was generated using the ASSEMBLIGN software program. A 2.19-kb 5′-flanking region of the rat GS was cloned into theSmaI site of promoterless pGL-3 enhancer vector creating the recombinant plasmid −2187/+2 GS-LUC. Primer extension analysis was done as described (11Yang H.P. Huang Z.Z. Wang J.H., Ou, X.P. Lu S, C. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Two antisense oligonucleotide primers complementary to −24 to +2 and −27 to −2 nucleotides relative to the translational start site of the rat GS (13Huang C.S., He, W. Meister A. Anderson M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Two and a half μg of poly(A+) RNA from H4IIE cells isolated as described (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63290) Google Scholar) was annealed to 106 cpm of the primers and extended with 4 units of Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc.). The primer extended products were analyzed on 7m urea, 6% polyacrylamide gels. The 2.19-kb fragment in the sense orientation upstream of the luciferase coding sequence of the pGL-3 enhancer vector (Promega) is the construct that contains the longest 5′-flanking sequence (−2187 to +2) employed in the transfection assay. To prepare 5′-deletion constructs, this plasmid was subjected to digestion with additional restriction enzymes to generate a series of deletion mutants. The enhancer/reporter transgene −1808/+2 GS-LUC was created by cloning an EcoRI fragment. −1164/+2 GS-LUC was created by using the Erase-a-Base System kit (Promega), which uses an exonuclease III that digests only 5′-overhangs or blunt-ended sites. The resulting DNA fragment containing the luciferase expression vector was blunt-ended by Klenow (Invitrogen) and self-ligated by T4 DNA ligase. −561/+2 GS-LUC was created by cloning aKpnI fragment, and −252/+2 GS-LUC was created by cloning aStuI fragment. Rat GCLC and GCLM promoter-luciferase constructs were previously described (11Yang H.P. Huang Z.Z. Wang J.H., Ou, X.P. Lu S, C. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Yang H.P. Wang J.H., Ou, X.P. Huang Z.Z. Lu S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Recombinant, replication-defective adenovirus expressing dominant-negative c-jun, TAM67, was kindly provided by Dr. David Brenner (16Bradham C.A. Hatano E. Brenner D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G1279-G1289PubMed Google Scholar). TAM67 is a truncation mutant of c-junthat lacks the transactivation domain, whereas the DNA binding domain remains intact, permitting dimerization with other AP-1 family members and inhibiting AP-1-mediated transcription (16Bradham C.A. Hatano E. Brenner D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G1279-G1289PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviruses encoding TAM67 or empty vector were amplified in 293 cells. H4IIE cells grown according to instructions provided (American Type Culture Collection number CRL-1548) were infected with unpurified recombinant adenovirus encoding for TAM67 or empty vector at multiplicity of 20 plaque-forming units/cell for 24 h. In preliminary experiments, this condition yielded maximum expression of TAM67 as determined by Northern blot analysis (not shown). After 24 h of infection, the viruses were removed and replaced with fresh medium for transfection analysis as described below. Relative transcriptional activity of the GS promoter fragments was studied using H4IIE cells transiently transfected with GS promoter-luciferase constructs for 7 h using the Superfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as we described previously (11Yang H.P. Huang Z.Z. Wang J.H., Ou, X.P. Lu S, C. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Yang H.P. Wang J.H., Ou, X.P. Huang Z.Z. Lu S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To study the effect of nuclear factor 1 (NF1) binding on GS promoter activity, the NF1 site at −1025 (NF1-1) was mutated from ACCAGACCACCCATCTGCCAACTCTGT to ACCAGACCACCCATCTTAAAACTCTGT (NF1m1), and the NF1 site at −808 (NF1-2) was mutated from TACACACCCTGGCTTGGTGCCTCACCA to TACACACCCTGGCTTGGTTAATCACCA (NF1m2), where the binding sites are underlined and the mutated sequence is shown in bold. Mutation was performed by PCR and confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. H4IIE cells were transfected with −1164/+2 GS-LUC that contained wild type, NF1m1 (first NF1 site is mutated) or NF1m1m2 (both NF1 sites are mutated), and the effect of the mutation was assessed by measuring luciferase activity. The effect of TBH on GS promoter activity was examined by measuring luciferase activity driven by GS promoter luciferase gene constructs in transfected H4IIE cells treated with TBH (60 μm) during the last 4 h of the transfection. To study the effect of blocking AP-1 activity, H4IIE cells infected previously with TAM67 or adenoviral vector alone were transfected with GS promoter constructs and treated with TBH (60 μm for 4 h). The same types of studies were also carried out using rat GCLC and GCLM promoter constructs. H4IIE cells were treated with 0–120 μm TBH for 4 h or 60 μm for 0–12 h. In some experiments, cells had been infected with adenovirus encoding dominant-negative c-jun or adenovirus vector alone prior to TBH treatment. At the end of the TBH treatment, total RNA was extracted, and Northern hybridization analysis was performed using specific rat GCLC, GCLM, GS, c-jun, and β-actin cDNA probes as described (14Huang Z.Z. Yang H.P. Chen C.J. Lu S.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The c-jun cDNA probe corresponds to nucleotides 362–882 of the published rat c-jun sequence (17Sakai M. Okuda A. Hatayama I. Sato K. Nishi S. Muramatsu M. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5633-5637PubMed Google Scholar) and was obtained by reverse transcription and PCR using a one-step reverse transcriptase-PCR kit (CLONTECH). Results of Northern blot analysis were normalized to β-actin. 32P-End-labeled fragments of the 5′-flanking region of rat GS strongly induced by TBH treatment were generated by digestion with restriction endonucleases. DNase I footprinting analysis was performed using double-stranded fragments corresponding to nucleotides −1207 to −997, −938 to −769, −768 to −561, −563 to −252, and −252 to +2 of the rat GS gene. These fragments were cloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen). Singly end-labeled fragments were generated with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase, and the DNase I footprinting procedure was performed as we described previously (11Yang H.P. Huang Z.Z. Wang J.H., Ou, X.P. Lu S, C. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). EMSAs for different regions of the rat GS promoter were done as described previously (11Yang H.P. Huang Z.Z. Wang J.H., Ou, X.P. Lu S, C. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Yang H.P. Wang J.H., Ou, X.P. Huang Z.Z. Lu S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) using 5–15 μg of nuclear protein from H4IIE cells treated with TBH (60 μm for 4 h) or vehicle control (Me2SO). The probes used included putative AP-1-binding sites (11 nucleotides long) at −1098, −902, −896, −856, −844, −607, −343, −339, −326, −218, −192, and −91 (flanked by 5′-CTTGA and GCCGG-3′ for each probe), Sp1-binding site at −689 (DNA fragment corresponds to −694 to −674), NF1-binding sites at −1025 (NF1-1), and −808 (NF1-2) that contain either wild type or mutated sequence (NF1m1 and NF1m2) as described above. Supershift analysis was performed with specific anti-c-jun, anti-Sp1, and anti-NF1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) as described previously (11Yang H.P. Huang Z.Z. Wang J.H., Ou, X.P. Lu S, C. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of dominant-negative c-jun, cells were previously infected with TAM67 and subsequently treated with TBH (60 μm for 4 h) and processed for EMSA and supershift analysis. Data are given as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by Fisher's test for multiple comparisons. For changes in mRNA levels, ratios of GCL subunits and GS to β-actin densitometric values were compared by ANOVA. Significance was defined by p < 0.05. The sequence of the 2.19-kb product is shown in Fig.1. Analysis of the transcription factor binding site was done using Transcription Factor Search (www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html) and MatInspector version 2.2 (www.gsf.de/cgi-bin/matsearch.pl). The 5′-flanking region of the rat GS contains numerous consensus binding sites for AP-1 and transcription factor 11. It also contains several consensus binding sites for CAAT enhancer-binding protein, myeloid zinc finger 1, NF1, nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2, hepatocyte-enriched nuclear factor-3b, Sp1, and one binding site for NFκB and heat shock transcription factor 2. Primer extension was used to determine the transcriptional start site. Two antisense oligonucleotide primers complementary to −24 to +2 (primer 1) and −27 to −2 (primer 2) nucleotides relative to the translational start site of the rat GS (13Huang C.S., He, W. Meister A. Anderson M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were annealed to poly(A+) RNA from H4IIE cells and extended toward the 5′ end of the mRNA by reverse transcription. Fig. 2 shows the primer extension reaction yielded products of ∼53 and 49 nucleotides long using primers 1 and 2, respectively. These products were not detected when the assay was carried out using tRNA (not shown). These results are consistent with the transcriptional start site being located 51 nucleotides upstream of the translational start site. To delineate sequences that drive the expression of the rat GS, five 5′-terminal nested deletion mutants ranging from −2187/+2 to −252/+2 were cloned into the promoterless luciferase reporter gene vector pGL3 enhancer. The promoterless construct pGL3 enhancer served as the background control. Luciferase activity was measured after transient transfection of H4IIE cells with these constructs. Fig.3 shows that the rat GS promoter was able to drive efficiently luciferase expression in H4IIE cells. The construct −561/+2 produced maximal promoter activity (61-fold increase over pGL-3) whereas the construct −1164/+2 produced about 11% of maximal activity, indicating presence of important elements between −561 and −51 and −1164 and −561 that positively or negatively regulated the promoter activity, respectively. Inclusion of an additional 1 kb upstream had no significant influence on the promoter activity. We next investigated the mechanism of repression in the region between −1164 and −561 of the GS promoter. Of the consensus binding sites present in this region, NF1 is of interest because it has been described to act as a transcriptional repressor (18Jahroudi N. Ardekani A.M. Greenberger J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21413-21421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of the two NF1-binding sites on the GS promoter, we performed EMSA with supershift analysis using double-stranded probes that span these two NF1 sites that contain either wild type or mutated sequence, and we measured luciferase activity driven by the GS promoter construct −1164/+2-LUC that contains wild type, NF1m1 (first NF1 site is mutated), or NF1m1m2 (both NF1 sites are mutated). Fig.4 shows that NF1 binds to both of these sites, but especially to site 2, and mutation of the first NF1 site led to a 5-fold increase in luciferase activity, whereas mutation of both NF1 sites led to a 16-fold increase in luciferase activity. We had shown previously that TBH induced the expression of both GCL subunits and GS in rat hepatocytes (14Huang Z.Z. Yang H.P. Chen C.J. Lu S.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Cai J. Huang Z.Z. Lu S.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). By having cloned the promoter region of all three genes, we are poised to investigate the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for the coordinate induction in gene expression. We first established the dose- and time-dependent effect of TBH on the expression of GSH synthetic enzymes in H4IIE cells (Fig. 5,A and B). Maximum induction was observed with 4 h of treatment of 60 μm TBH, which was used as the treatment protocol for all subsequent studies involving TBH. TBH also induced a transient increase in the mRNA level of c-jun(Fig. 5 C). We next examined the effect of TBH treatment on the promoter activity of GCL subunits and GS. Fig. 3 shows that TBH treatment induced markedly the reporter activity driven by the GS promoter, particularly the promoter construct −1164 to +2, where TBH led to a 35-fold increase in activity. TableI summarizes the effect of TBH treatment on the promoter activity of the two GCL subunits. Similar to the effect on GS promoter, TBH also induced markedly the activity of both GCL subunit promoters. Maximum induction was seen with the GCLC construct −707/+2-LUC (about 10-fold over control) and GCLM construct −441/+1-LUC (about 13-fold over control).Table IEffects of TBH and dominant-negative c-Jun on GCLC and GCLM promoter activitiesPromoter constructsControlTBHDN c-JunDN c-Jun + TBHGCLCpGL-3-LUC1.0 ± 00.9 ± 0.03−113/+2-LUC1.7 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.1−597/+2-LUC87.4 ± 0.9387.6 ± 26.0ap < 0.05 versus respective controls.−707/+2-LUC48.7 ± 6.3474.8 ± 10.5ap < 0.05 versus respective controls.24.1 ± 4.5ap < 0.05 versus respective controls.116.7 ± 11.6bp < 0.05 versusTBH treatment by ANOVA.−1110/+2-LUC75.2 ± 7.0427.6 ± 36.2ap < 0.05 versus respective controls.−1760/+2-LUC62.1 ± 7.5418.0 ± 21.6ap < 0.05 versus respective controls.GCLMpGL-3-LUC1.0 ± 01.2 ± 0.1−154/+1-LUC2.6 ± 0.240.4 ± 6.7ap < 0.05 versus respective controls.−441/+1-LUC18.6 ± 3.2247.1 ± 26.5ap < 0.05 versus respective controls.8.6 ± 0.8ap < 0.05 versus respective controls.44.8 ± 2.9bp < 0.05 versusTBH treatment by ANOVA.−649/+1-LUC86.0 ± 9.7231.9 ± 31.9ap < 0.05 versus respective controls.−850/+1-LUC57.2 ± 3.6148.5 ± 15.4ap < 0.05 versus respective controls.−1251/+1-LUC8.6 ± 1.920.6 ± 4.2ap < 0.05 versus respective controls.−1850/+1-LUC8.7 ± 2.218.9 ± 4.9ap < 0.05 versus respective controls.Results represent mean ± S.E. from 3 to 6 separate experiments expressed as fold of pGL-3 enhancer vector.

Cells were then treated with vehicle control (Me2SO) or TBH (60 μm) for 4 h).

Open table in a new tab Results represent mean ± S.E. from 3 to 6 separate experiments expressed as fold of pGL-3 enhancer vector. H4IIE cells were transfected with GCLC or GCLM promoter-luciferase constructs and treated with 60 μm TBH for the last 4 h of the transfection as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To examine the effect of dominant-negative c-Jun (DN c-Jun), H4IIE cells were previously infected with adenoviral vectors encoding DN c-Jun or adenoviral vectors alone prior to transfection with −707/+2 GCLC-LUC or −441/+1 GCLM-LUC constructs. Cells were then treated with vehicle control (Me2SO) or TBH (60 μm) for 4 h). Adenoviral vector alone and Me2SO had no effect on the luciferase activity. To delineate the cis-acting elements that may be involved in mediating the effect of TBH on the GS promoter, DNase I footprinting analysis of the 1.2-kb 5′-flanking region of the GS gene was carried out. Fig. 6 shows footprinting results using probes that span the region −1207 to +2. Nuclear protein-dependent DNase I-protected areas are present in regions −1065 to −1036, −901 to −830, −707 to −679, −354 to −314, and −104 to −68. Except for the region −707 to −679, the other regions all contain multiple AP-1-binding sites. Because AP-1 is known to be induced by TBH (21Pinkus R. Weiner L.M. Daniel V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13422-13429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) and there are 12 AP-1-binding sites in the 1.08-kb 5′-flanking region of the GS gene, we next examined which of these may be affected by TBH treatment. Fig. 7shows increased AP-1 binding to six of the potential AP-1 sites (−1058, −896, −844, −343, −326, and −91) in response to TBH treatment. This was confirmed by supershift analysis using anti-c-jun antibodies (Fig. 7). However, the other six potential AP-1-binding sites (−902, −856, −607, −339, −218, and −192) exhibited no change in AP-1 binding in response to TBH treatment (data not shown). Although the region −707 to −679 of the GS promoter does not contain AP-1 element, it contains an Sp1 element (−689 to −680). We next investigated whether TBH treatment also induced Sp1 binding. Fig.8 shows that there is also a striking increase in Sp1 binding to this Sp1 site in response to TBH. To evaluate the importance of AP-1 in both the basal expression and in the TBH-mediated increase in expression of GSH synthetic enzymes, H4IIE cells were infected with dominant-negative c-jun, and the effect of blocking AP-1 activity on TBH-mediated changes was examined. Fig. 9shows that the basal expression of both GCL subunits and GS fell when AP-1 activity was blocked (both GCLM and GS decreased by more than 50%; GCLC fell by 30%). The TBH-mediated increase in the mRNA level of all three genes was also significantly blocked. Dominant-negative c-jun also blocked significantly the TBH-mediated increase in AP-1 binding to the GS promoter (Fig. 7), and reporter activity driven by GCLC, GCLM, and GS promoters (Fig. 3 and Table I). Note that the basal promoter activity was reduced by 40–50% in all of the promoter constructs (Fig. 3 and Table I). In addition to blocking AP-1 binding to the GS promoter, dominant-negative c-jun also reduced significantly Sp1 binding to the Sp1 site at −689 to −680 of the GS promoter under basal conditions and in response to TBH treatment (Fig. 8). Note that c-jun does not bind directly to the Sp1 site as supershift occurred with anti-Sp1 antibodies but not anti-c-junantibodies (Fig. 8). GSH is the most abundant non-protein thiol that is important in numerous cellular processes including antioxidant defense, storage of cysteine, and maintenance of the redox state (1Lu S.C. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1169-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). One of the major determinants of the synthesis of GSH is the activity of GCL. Because of its importance, regulation of GCL has been a topic of extensive research (1Lu S.C. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1169-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). In contrast, little attention has been paid to GS. GS deficiency in humans can result in dramatic metabolic consequences because the accumulated γ-glutamylcysteine is converted to 5-oxoproline which can cause severe metabolic acidosis, hemolytic anemia, and central nervous system damage (13Huang C.S., He, W. Meister A. Anderson M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Shi Z.Z. Habib G.M. Rhead W.J. Gahl W.A., He, X. Sazer S. Lieberman M.W. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Mutation inactivation of GS has been described (22Shi Z.Z. Habib G.M. Rhead W.J. Gahl W.A., He, X. Sazer S. Lieberman M.W. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently two reports have shown a selective fall in GS activity which resulted in lowered GSH level (23Choi J. Liu R.M. Kundu R.K. Sangiorgi F., Wu, W. Maxson R. Forman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3693-3698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 24Luo J.L. Hammarqvist F. Andersson K. Wernerman J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E359-E365PubMed Google Scholar). If GCL is rate-limiting, how can a change in GS activity influence the steady state GSH level? Although the specific activity of GS is normally 2–4 times that of GCL activity in normal liver (25Lu S.C., Ge, J. Kuhlenkamp J. Kaplowitz N. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), this may not be the case in other tissues. In fact, in normal human skeletal muscle, the specific activity of GS was only 36% higher than that of GCL (24Luo J.L. Hammarqvist F. Andersson K. Wernerman J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E359-E365PubMed Google Scholar). Surgical trauma selectively reduced GS activity, which became rate-limiting (24Luo J.L. Hammarqvist F. Andersson K. Wernerman J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E359-E365PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively these results suggest regulation of GS has been overlooked and may be just as important in determining the overall GSH synthetic capacity as GCL under certain conditions and in non-hepatic tissues. By using treatments that are known to influence the hepatic GCL subunit expression, we found treatments that increase the expression of both GCL subunits also increased the expression of GS (14Huang Z.Z. Yang H.P. Chen C.J. Lu S.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This coordinated induction in GS and GCL led to higher GSH synthetic capacity than induction in GCL alone (14Huang Z.Z. Yang H.P. Chen C.J. Lu S.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To better understand GS transcriptional regulation and how coordinated regulation of GSH synthetic enzymes occur, we have cloned and characterized the rat GS promoter and elucidated the molecular mechanism of TBH-induced coordinated increase in the expression of GSH synthetic enzymes. The sequence of 5′-flanking region of the rat GS contains numerous AP-1 and transcription factor 11-binding sites but no ARE site. This is similar to the rat GCL subunit promoters, which also lack ARE elements (11Yang H.P. Huang Z.Z. Wang J.H., Ou, X.P. Lu S, C. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Yang H.P. Wang J.H., Ou, X.P. Huang Z.Z. Lu S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Primer extension analysis revealed a single transcriptional start site located 51 nucleotides upstream of the translational start site. Transfection studies showed that the 5′-flanking sequence of the rat GS gene contains a functional promoter that was able to drive luciferase expression in H4IIE cells efficiently. Maximal promoter activity was obtained with the GS promoter construct −561/+2-LUC, denoting the presence of enhancer element(s) in this region. In contrast, the presence of repressor element(s) is suggested between −1164 and −561 as the promoter activity fell almost 9-fold. By using EMSA, supershift, and site-directed mutagenesis analyses, we found NF1 to be a strong repressor of the rat GS promoter. NF1 binds to both sites (−1025 and −808), and when binding is prevented by mutagenesis, the resulting promoter activity surpassed the maximal activity obtained with the −561/+2-LUC construct, suggesting that many of the enhancer elements (i.e. the AP-1 sites) in the region between −1164 and −561 were suppressed. By having cloned the promoter region of both GCL subunits (11Yang H.P. Huang Z.Z. Wang J.H., Ou, X.P. Lu S, C. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Yang H.P. Wang J.H., Ou, X.P. Huang Z.Z. Lu S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and GS in the rat and having shown that TBH induces comparably the expression of all three genes in rat hepatocytes (14Huang Z.Z. Yang H.P. Chen C.J. Lu S.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we next examined the molecular mechanism(s) of this coordinate induction. TBH has been shown by others to induce the nuclear binding activity of AP-1, NFκB, and ARE (21Pinkus R. Weiner L.M. Daniel V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13422-13429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 26Kang K.W. Cho M.K. Lee C.H. Kim S.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, it has also been shown to induce the human GCLM promoter activity independent of ARE or AP-1 (27Galloway D.C. McLellan L.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Similar to rat hepatocytes, TBH exerted a comparable increase in the mRNA levels of both GCL subunits and GS in the rat hepatoma cell line H4IIE in a dose- and time-dependent manner. TBH also induced strongly the reporter activity driven by all three promoter-luciferase constructs, although with varying magnitude depending on the length of the construct. DNase I footprinting analysis was next used to elucidate possible cis-acting elements involved in mediating the effect of TBH. After TBH treatment, there was a dramatic increase in protein binding to several regions of the GS promoter, and all except one is rich in AP-1 sites. EMSA with supershift was then used to see which of the 12 potential AP-1 sites present in the 1.1-kb 5′-flanking region of the GS gene exhibited increased binding after TBH treatment. Consistent with results obtained with DNase I footprinting, increased AP-1 binding activity was confirmed with EMSA and supershift analysis to putative AP-1-binding sites at −1058, −896, −844, −343, −326, and −91. Similarly, no increase in protein or AP-1 binding activity was detected to putative AP-1-binding sites at −607, −218 or −192 with DNase I footprinting or EMSA analysis, respectively. Although putative AP-1-binding sites at −902, −856, and −339 are in the regions found to have increased protein binding after TBH treatment on DNase I footprinting analysis, no change in AP-1 binding activity was detected with EMSA. TBH treatment also led to increased Sp1 binding to the Sp1 site at −689 to −680, which is in the region detected to have increased protein binding on DNase I footprinting analysis but devoid of AP-1 site. To confirm that AP-1 binding led to transactivation of the gene, cells were infected with dominant-negative c-jun prior to TBH treatment. Blocking AP-1 activity led to a fall in the basal mRNA level of all three genes and their constitutive promoter activities. This finding is similar to what has been reported also for the human GCL subunit promoters and GCLC mRNA level, where AP-1 activity is required for constitutive activity and basal expression (27Galloway D.C. McLellan L.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Rahman I. Smith C.A.D. Antonicelli F. MacNee W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29Sekhar K.R. Meredith M.J. Kerr L.D. Soltaninassab S.R. Spitz D.R., Xu, Z.Q. Freeman M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, blocking AP-1 activity also blocked significantly the TBH-mediated increase in the promoter activity of the rat GCL subunits and GS as well as the mRNA levels of all three genes. The inhibition was not complete, however, which may reflect that fact that increased AP-1 binding was not completely abolished (see Fig. 7). Of interest is that blocking AP-1 activity also blocked the increase in Sp1 binding (Fig. 8). Recently direct physical interaction between c-jun and Sp1 has been demonstrated, and c-junwas able to synergize the transactivation of Sp1 without actually binding to the DNA itself (30Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29572-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 31Chen B.K. Chang W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10406-10411Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we also did not detect c-jun binding to the Sp1 site (Fig. 8). Our data suggest that dominant-negative c-jun interacted with Sp1 and prevented its binding to the GS promoter. This can explain the decrease in Sp1 binding activity under basal conditions as well as in response to TBH treatment (Fig. 8). It is likely that functional cooperation between c-jun and Sp1 also contributes to the TBH-mediated induction of GS. Finally, our data do not preclude other AP-1-independent mechanism(s) in contributing to the TBH-induced up-regulation of the GSH synthetic enzymes. In summary, we have cloned and analyzed the 5′-flanking region of the rat GS gene. The rat GS promoter contains both positive and negative regulatory regions. NF1 is an important repressor of the GS promoter. By using the cloned rat GCL and GS promoters, we have identified AP-1 activity as essential for their constitutive expression and for the up-regulation of all three genes in response to TBH. 293 and H4IIE cells were provided by the Cell Culture Core of the University of Southern California Liver Disease Research Center which is supported by National Institutes of Health Grant P30 DK48522."

TR2 orphan receptor (TR2), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily without identified ligands, is found to be expressed in the breast cancer cell lines and to function as a repressor to suppress ER-mediated transcriptional activity. Utilizing an interaction blocker, ER-6 (amino acids 312–340), responsible for TR2 interaction, the suppression of ER by TR2 could be reversed, suggesting that this suppression is conferred by the direct protein-protein interaction. Administration of antisense TR2, resulting in an enhancement of ER transcriptional activity in MCF7 cells, indicates that endogenous TR2 normally suppresses ER-mediated signaling. To gain insights into the molecular mechanism by which TR2 suppresses ER, we found that TR2 could interrupt ER DNA binding via formation of an ER-TR2 heterodimer that disrupted the ER homodimerization. The suppression of ER transcription by TR2 consequently caused the inhibition of estrogen-induced cell growth and G1/S transition in estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells. Taken together in addition to the potential roles in spermatogenesis and neurogenesis, our data provide a novel biological function of TR2 that may exert an important repressor in regulating ER activity in mammary glands.

Also, it has been shown that TR2 is primarily expressed in the mouse testis, particularly in the developing germ cells, indicating a role of TR2 in spermatogenesis (12Lee C.H. Chang L. Wei L.N. Mol.

In terms of the regulation of TR2 expression, TR2 can be induced during neuronal differentiation in P19 embryonic carcinoma cells stimulated by CNTF. In return, TR2 activates its target gene, CNTF receptor, expression, which mediates CNTF signaling and is required for the motor neuron development (13Young W.J. Lee Y.F. Smith S.M. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20877-20885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22DeChiara T.M. Vejsada R. Poueymirou W.T. Acheson A. Suri C. Conover J.C. Friedman B. McClain J.

The tumor suppressor genes p53 and Rb which induce cell cycle arrest, can down-regulate TR2 expression in cells after ionizing radiation and in cells overexpressing p53 or Rb (23Mu X. Liu Y.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14649-14652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). TR2 can then go through a feedback control mechanism to induce HPV-16 E6 and E7 target gene expression, which are known to enhance the p53 protein degradation and inactivate the Rb function, respectively (23Mu X.

Estrogen receptors (ERs), including ERα and ERβ, belong to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and mediate estrogen actions in regulation of cell growth and differentiation, particularly in mammary glands and uterus in females (for reviews, see Refs. 26Nilsson S.

The proliferation of mammary glands is mainly dependent on estrogen stimulation; however, the proliferating epithelial cells detected in terminal end buds at the tip of elongating ducts in mammary glands are usually ER-negative (28Zeps N.

Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1541-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Despite the unclear role of ER in this process, in mice with a homozygous disruption of the ER gene, the mammary glands remain undeveloped, as demonstrated by the lack of terminal end buds and alveolar structures, even though the serum estrogen level is 10 times higher than those in wild-type mice (31Couse J.F.

Korach K.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1869-1876PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates an indispensable role of the ER in the growth of mammary glands. Also, the fact that more than two-thirds of breast cancers from patients are ER-positive and benefit from antiestrogen or ovariectomy therapies strengthens the importance of the ER in the stimulation of cell growth in mammary glands in response to estrogen (33Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group. Lancet. 1998; 351: 1451-1467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms involving the suppression of ER-mediated gene expression and cell proliferation may eventually help us to develop better drugs to battle breast cancer. In addition to functioning as a transcription regulator, TR2 can modulate other signaling via different mechanisms. For example, TR2 suppresses RXR and RXR/retinoic acid receptor-mediated transcription by binding to the same DNA response element with a higher binding affinity (15Lin T.M. Young W.J. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30121-30128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and represses thyroid receptor α/RXR signaling by competing for limited amounts of DNA response elements (20Chang C. Pan H.J. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 189: 195-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TR2 can also exert its suppressive effects via the recruitment of class I and class II histone deacetylases (34Franco P.J. Farooqui M. Seto E. Wei L.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1318-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate a new role of TR2 in the breast cancer cells where TR2 suppresses ER-mediated transcription and cell growth by direct protein-protein interaction, thus representing a novel signaling pathway within the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily.

The GAL4-ER (aa 282–595) and pCMV-mERβ were gifts from Dr. Hinrich Gronemeyer (Strasbourg, France) and Vincent Giguère (McGill University, Queábec, Canada), respectively. To construct GST-ER fragments, ER cDNA fragments were released from pSG5-ER (36Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) using adequate restriction enzymes and inserted into the pGEX vector series (Amersham Biosciences) to produce pGEX-3X-ER-1 (aa 1–165), pGEX-2T-ER-2 (aa 123–340), pGEX-2T-ER-3 (aa 312–595), pGEX-3X-ER-4 (aa 552–595), pGEX-2T-ER-5 (aa 123–312), and pGEX-2T-ER-6 (aa 312–340). The pGEX-KG-TR2-1, -2, and -3 plasmids were constructed by insertion of PCR-generated cDNA fragments corresponding to aa 1–112, 88–196, and 179–603, respectively, into pGEX-KG vector (a gift from Dr. Frank B. Furnari, University of California, San Diego, CA). pCDNA3-TR2-fl AS and pIRES-TR2-N AS were constructed by insertion of antisense orientation cDNAs, encoding full-length and N terminus (aa 1–112), into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) and pIRES (CLONTECH), respectively. Transfections in the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method, as described previously (37Yeh S., Hu, Y.C. Rahman M. Lin H.K.

CAT reporter plasmids containing one copy of estrogen response element (ERE-CAT) or mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV-CAT) were used as indicated. Also, a β-galactosidase expression plasmid, pCMV-β-gal, was used for internal control. For the luciferase assay, luciferase reporters (ERE-luc and MMTV-luc) were transfected into cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method or SuperFect Transcription Reagent (Qiagen) as indicated. pRL-TK vector (Promega) encodingRenilla luciferase was used for internal control, and luciferase activity was analyzed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions. MCF7 cells plated on 100-mm dishes were solubilized in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation was performed using rabbit anti-ER antibody (1:100) (H-184) and then analyzed by Western blotting with anti-ER (1:1000) (H-184) or anti-TR2 (1:1000) (G204) antibodies, followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or rabbit anti-mouse IgM antibodies and visualized with alkaline phosphatase conjugate substrate kit (Bio-Rad). GST alone and GST fusion proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads as instructed by manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The pull-down assay was performed with 5 μl of in vitro translated 35S-labeled proteins as described previously (37Yeh S., Hu, Y.C. Rahman M. Lin H.K. Hsu C.L. Ting H.J. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc.

Human complement C3 ERE (containing one imperfect palindromic inverted repeat: 5′-AGGTGGCCCTGACCC-3′) end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP was used as a probe. ER and TR2 werein vitro translated by the TNT system (Promega) as instructed by manufacturer. Reactions were performed in 20 μl of EMSA binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mmKCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 6% glycerol). For the antibody supershift analysis, 1 μl of the monoclonal anti-ERα antibody (C-314) was used. The protein-DNA complexes were analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide native gel containing 2.5% glycerol in 1× Tris borate EDTA. The studies of TR2 tissue distribution demonstrate that TR2 is expressed in many tissues with higher expression in brain and male reproductive organs (1Chang C. Kokontis J. Acakpo-Satchivi L. Liao S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10405-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To explore whether TR2 is expressed in female tissues, the expression of TR2 mRNA was examined in several breast cancer cells using Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig.1, TR2 transcripts around 2.5 kilobases were detected in three ER-positive breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, T47D, and ZR-75-1) at different expression levels. Also, TR2 transcripts could be detected in LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer cells as a control (Fig. 1). The ER is known to be highly involved in the breast cancer development because two-thirds of breast tumors contain a functional ER that mediates estrogen responsiveness to stimulate cell growth. Because the TR2 was detected in the breast cancer cells, we wondered if TR2 could affect ER function. Using the ERE-CAT reporter system, TR2 was found to consistently suppress the transcriptional activity of exogenous (in PC-3 and H1299 cells) and endogenous (in MCF7 and T47D cells) ER in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2A). To determine whether the expression level of the ER was affected by TR2, we used a stable clone of MCF7-TR2 cells, where the expression of FLAG-tagged TR2 driven by pBIG2i vector could be induced by doxycycline treatment (2 μg/ml) and detected by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig.2B). First, the expression of doxycycline-induced FLAG-TR2 was not influenced by 17β-estradiol (E2) treatment. Secondly, the expression level of the ER was not suppressed by overexpressed FLAG-TR2 induced by doxycycline in MCF7-TR2 cells, indicating that the suppression of the ER by TR2 does not result from the down-regulation of ER expression. Also, we found that, in transient transfection assays, both endogenous and exogenous ER levels were not affected by transiently overexpressed TR2 in MCF7 and COS-1 cells (data not shown). Consistent with the phenomenon in Fig. 2A, ER was suppressed by doxycycline-induced TR2 in MCF7-TR2 cells (Fig. 2C). By contrast, the doxycycline treatment did not affect ER transcriptional activity in the MCF7-pBIG cells, which were stably transfected with the pBIG2i parent vector (Fig. 2C). To rule out the artificial effects linked to foreign reporters, as demonstrated in Fig. 2,A and C, PR expression, an endogenous target gene of the ER, was examined. As shown in Fig. 2D, TR2 could repress E2-induced PR expression at mRNA and protein levels in T47D cells as well as in MCF7 cells (data not shown). Interestingly, TR2 could also suppress the basal level of ER transcription in the absence of E2 (data not shown). For examining the specificity, we also tested the effect of TR2 on other classical steroid receptors. As shown in Fig. 2E, whereas TR2 could also suppress ERβ- and androgen receptor (AR)-mediated transcription in HEK293 (no detectable ER) and PC-3 cells, respectively, TR2 has little effect on the PR- or glucocorticoid receptor-mediated transcription in T47D cells. Taken together, results from Fig. 2 demonstrate that TR2 can suppress ERα-mediated transcription, and these suppressive effects are rather receptor-specific. To investigate whether TR2 and the ER are physically associated, co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays were carried out for examination of in vivo and in vitro interaction, respectively. Cell extracts from MCF7 cells treated with ethanol, E2, and tamoxifen were co-immunoprecipitated with anti-ER antibody (H-184). Immunocomplexes were then Western-blotted with anti-TR2 antibody (G204). As shown in Fig. 3A, TR2 was in ER immunocomplexes in the presence of ethanol, E2, or tamoxifen. Using GST pull-down assays, GST-TR2 fusion protein could directly interact within vitro translated 35S-labeled ER and AR but not RXRα (Fig. 3B). For testing ligand effects on the ER-TR2 binding, not much difference was found among different treatments (Fig. 3C). Collectively, these results suggest that ER and TR2 are directly associated with each other in a ligand-independent manner. To dissect the TR2 interaction domain on the ER, six ER peptides fused with GST were tested in GST pull-down assays. As shown in Fig.4A, GST-ER-2 (aa 123–340) and GST-ER-3 (aa 312–595), but not GST-ER-1 (aa 1–165) and GST-ER-4 (aa 552–595), can interact with TR2 in the presence or absence of E2. Furthermore, GST-ER-6 (aa 312–340), the overlapping region between GST-ER-2 and -3, but not GST-ER-5 (aa 123–312), showed positive interaction with TR2, indicating that ER-6 domain is responsible for this interaction. On the other hand, three GST-fused TR2 fragments, GST-TR2-1, -2, and -3, corresponding to N terminus (aa 1–112), DBD (aa 88–196), and LBD (aa 179–603), respectively, were also examined to locate the ER binding region. As shown in Fig. 4B, GST-TR2-2, but not GST-TR2-1 or -3, was responsible for binding to the ER. Small proteins (<20∼30 kDa) are presumably capable of quickly crossing nuclear pore complexes via passive diffusion (39Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). Ideally, introducing small peptides containing interaction sequences may mask the binding sites from binding to the interacting proteins in either cytoplasm or nucleus. The small peptide ER-6 was, therefore, tested to determine whether it can serve as an interaction blocker to interfere with ER-TR2 binding by using the GST pull-down assay and mammalian two-hybrid system where in vitro translated HA-tagged ER-6 and pCDNA3-HA-ER-6 plasmid were introduced, respectively. First, the interaction of GST-TR2 with35S-labeled ER was inhibited by increasing amounts of HA-ER-6 peptide (Fig. 5A). Secondly, GAL4-ER can interact with VP16-TR2 in the presence of E2, according to the induction of CAT activity, and this ER-TR2 interaction was suppressed when co-transfecting with pCDNA3-HA-ER-6 (Fig.5B). Thus, based on these results, ER-6 is able to be an interaction blocker. Next, to determine whether direct association is required for TR2 to suppress the ER, pCDNA3-HA-ER-6 was applied in an ERE-CAT reporter gene assay. As shown in Fig. 5C, the E2-induced ER transcription was significantly repressed by the doxycycline-induced TR2 in a dose-dependent fashion in MCF7-TR2 cells. The addition of ER-6 was then capable of reversing this suppression, suggesting that TR2 suppresses the ER through direct interaction. Antisense TR2 expression plasmids, pCDNA3-TR2-fl AS and pIRES-TR2-N AS, were assessed in a ERE-luciferase assay to determine whether reducing endogenous TR2 expression might significantly enhance ER activity in MCF7 cells. First, using Western blotting with anti-TR2 antibody (G204), those two antisense constructs were proven to be able to reduce the expression of endogenous TR2 as well as overexpressed TR2 (Fig.6A). This reduction of endogenous TR2 by antisense plasmids resulted in an increase in ER transcription in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.6B), indicating that endogenous TR2 normally suppresses ER activity in MCF7 cells. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which the ER was suppressed by interacting with TR2, we have tested the effect of TR2 on ER expression, stability, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and interaction with coregulators. We found that overexpression of TR2 did not influence ER expression (Fig.2B), stability, or nuclear translocation (data not shown). Using GST pull-down assays and mammalian two-hybrid assays, TR2 did not affect the binding between the ER and some coregulators such as SRC-1, TIF-II, and ARA70 (data not shown). After excluding those possibilities, we found that TR2 may mainly influence the ER on DNA binding. Using the EMSA assay as shown in Fig.7A, two specific ER-ERE bands could be detected (lanes 3 and 4) and were supershifted by ER antibody (C-314) (lanes 5 and6, indicated as an arrowhead). Two ER-ERE bands are presumably composed of a monomer and a dimer of ER bound to ERE. Because the sequences of ERE used in this assay contain one imperfect palindromic inverted repeat, the ER was bound to the half side of ERE as monomer. However, the monomer of ER bound to ERE does not occurin vivo because of the instability (40Klinge C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2905-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Then, the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled ERE could effectively eliminate these bands (lanes 7 and 8). Interestingly, the intensity of these ER-ERE complexes was decreased upon the addition of increasing amounts of TR2 in either the absence (lanes 9–11) or the presence of 10 nm E2 (lanes 12–14). Because no ERE-TR2-specific band (lane 2) and no extra supershifted band formed as TR2-ER-ERE complexes (lanes 3–4 versus 9–14) were found, we may conclude that TR2 interacts with the ER, resulting in the ER dissociating from binding to DNA. Accordingly, the competition assay (Fig. 7B) showed that the ER homodimer formation, as illustrated by the interaction between GST-ER-LBD and35S-labeled ER, was decreased by the presence of TR2, and conversely, the he"

Use of dilute (5%) polyacrylamide gels containing 6 m urea allowed the resolution of one very large (∼500-kDa) okadaic acid- and naringin-sensitive phosphoprotein, identified by tryptic fingerprinting, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and immunostaining as the cytolinker protein, plectin.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1099-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), whereas the protective function of Bcl-2 may be exerted only during the slower form of apoptosis (11Fladmark K.E.

Early cytoskeletal changes are prominent both in slow and rapid toxin-induced apoptosis (4Bøe R. Gjertsen B.T. Vintermyr O.K. Houge G. Lanotte M. Døskeland S.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 195: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 8Blankson H. Grotterød E.M. Seglen P.O. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In rat hepatocytes, the slow apoptosis induced by low doses of okadaic acid was associated with an early phosphorylation of keratin, accompanied by disintegration of the keratin intermediate filament network and of the keratin- and actin-containing bile canalicular sheaths, whereas the general microtubular and microfilamentous networks were unaffected (3Berven G. Sætre F. Halvorsen K. Seglen P.O. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 8Blankson H. Grotterød E.M. Seglen P.O.

Rapid hepatocyte apoptosis elicited by high concentrations of okadaic acid or microcystin was similarly associated with keratin phosphorylation and with extensive cytoskeletal rearrangements as indicated by surface blebbing and the rounding of monolayer cells (4Bøe R. Gjertsen B.T. Vintermyr O.K. Houge G. Lanotte M. Døskeland S.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 195: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar,22Ohta T. Nishiwaki R. Yatsunami J. Komori A. Suganuma M.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 23-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other cell types, intermediate filament networks composed of vimentin, keratin, or neurofilament proteins were similarly found to undergo phosphorylation-dependent disintegration after okadaic acid treatment (24Yatsunami J. Fujiki H. Suganuma M. Yoshizawa S. Eriksson J.E. Olson M.O.J. Goldman R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25Yatsunami J. Komori A.

Disruption of intermediate filament networks would thus seem to be a characteristic, early feature of apoptosis elicited by algal toxins. Although the molecular mechanism of such network disruption has not been clarified, the ability of okadaic acid to induce phosphorylation and detachment of several cytoskeleton-associated proteins, including the cross-linking protein Tau (28Lin S.X.H. Ferro K.L. Collins C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29Onoda K. Yin H.L. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), suggests that phosphorylation of structural intermediate filament proteins as well as of their associated cross-linking proteins (32Chou Y.-H. Skalli O. Goldman R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) could be involved. In a previous study, we found that the keratin phosphorylation and apoptotic cell death induced by okadaic acid or microcystin in rat hepatocytes could be prevented by the grapefruit flavonoid, naringin (8Blankson H. Grotterød E.M. Seglen P.O. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Naringin had no such protective effect on hepatoma cells of human or rat origin (8Blankson H. Grotterød E.M. Seglen P.O. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), making the flavonoid interesting both as a potential chemotherapeutic agent (in combination, for example, with a nonspecific algal toxin to allow cancer cell killing while protecting normal cells) and as a tool to investigate the mechanisms of toxin-induced cell death. To identify hepatocellular proteins subject to okadaic acid-induced, naringin-sensitive phosphorylation, and therefore candidates for involvement in the apoptotic process, we have taken a proteomic approach, separating phosphoproteins by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identifying them by mass spectrometry. In the present report, we show that one such naringin-sensitive phosphoprotein can be identified as the high molecular weight cytolinker protein, plectin, known to be of prime importance for the maintenance of intermediate filament networks (33Steinböck F.A. Wiche G. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1999; 380: 151-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Okadaic acid and microcystin-LR were from Alexis Biochemicals (Läufelfingen, Switzerland). Calyculin A, cantharidin, and tautomycin were from Calbiochem. SDS, acrylamide, and bisacrylamide were obtained from Bio-Rad. Biotinylated anti-mouse antibody, streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase, fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody, Rainbow molecular weight markers (RPN 800), and the ECL Western blotting detection kit were from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody and polyclonal rabbit antibodies against phosphothreonine, phospho-AMPK (Thr172), phospho-SEK1/MKK4 (Thr261), phospho-SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), phospho-p70 S6 kinase (Thr421/Ser424), phospho-p70 S6 kinase (Thr389), and phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (Ser240/Ser244) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Trypsin (sequencing grade, modified by reductive methylation) was from Promega (Madison, WI), and the peptide calibration mix 1, used for calibration of mass spectra, was from Applied Biosystems (Framingham, MA). Dry milk powder was from Nestle (Vevey, Switzerland), nitrocellulose membranes were from Osmonics (Westborough, MA), and Mowiol was from Hoechst (Frankfurt, Germany). Methanol and acetic acid were from Merck. The mouse monoclonal anti-plectin antibody (clone 7A8) and most other biochemicals were purchased from Sigma. Hepatocytes were isolated from 18-h starved male Wistar rats (200–250 g; Harlan UK Ltd., Shaws Farm, Oxon, UK) by two-step collagenase perfusion (34Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar), purified by differential centrifugation, and resuspended in suspension buffer supplemented with 2 mm Mg2+ and 15 mm pyruvate (34Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). For plectin studies, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C as 2-ml aliquots (∼2·106 cells) in 5-cm Nunclon Petri dishes, precoated with albumin to prevent attachment of cells to the substratum (35Gjessing R. Seglen P.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 129: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); for protein kinase immunoblotting studies, the cells were incubated as 0.4-ml aliquots (∼4·106 cells) in shaking 15-ml centrifuge tubes (34Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). After incubation, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C, being sedimented each time at 1600 rpm for 4 min. The cells were lysed for 30 min on ice in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.4% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mmEDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 20 mm Tris-base, pH 7.2. For immunoblotting, two parts of cell lysate were diluted with one part of triple-strength SDS gel-loading buffer (single strength; 2% SDS, 1 mmercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C, and 10 μg of protein was fractionated by one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins in the mass range 30–150 kDa were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS (0.1%), run at 200 V for ∼40 min. To obtain better resolution of higher molecular weight proteins, 6m urea was included in the lysis buffer and in all subsequent solutions; otherwise, the samples were prepared as described above. The separation was made in dilute (5%) SDS-polyacrylamide resolving gels containing 6 m urea, with SDS-3% polyacrylamide stacking gels, also containing 6 m urea. To prevent proteins from precipitating in the stacking gel, the electrophoresis was run at low voltage (50 V for 30 min and at 150 V for 45 min). All gels were run with Rainbow molecular weight markers (Amersham Biosciences). The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose blotting membranes using a semidry transfer unit (Bio-Rad). For blotting of the 10% gels, Towbin's blotting buffer (192 mm glycine, 20% methanol, 25 mm Tris-base, pH 8.3) was used. To assure the best possible blotting of high molecular weight proteins, the same buffer, but without methanol, was used for blotting of the 5% gels containing 6 m urea. All membranes were blocked by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 5% dry milk in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and washed three times for 5 min in PBS-T. For plectin detection, the blotting membranes were incubated for 3 h at room temperature with a monoclonal anti-plectin antibody (diluted 1:2000 in PBS-T). The membranes were then washed three times in PBS-T, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with biotinylated anti-mouse antibody (diluted 1:1000 in PBS-T), washed three times and incubated for another 30 min at room temperature with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:3000 in PBS-T). The membranes were washed three times again before they were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL Western Detection Kit (Amersham Biosciences). For detection of threonine-phosphorylated proteins, the membranes were incubated for 3 h at room temperature with a rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphothreonine antibody (diluted 1:1000 in PBS-T). After washing three times with PBS-T, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:2000 in PBS-T), washed three times, and visualized as described above. The same procedure was used for immunoblotting with other phosphospecific polyclonal rabbit antibodies. Gels to be used for protein identification by MALDI-TOF MS were stained overnight with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 dissolved in 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 45% deionized water and then carefully destained with the above solvent before the protein bands of interest were cut out. The bands excised from the stained gel were cut into small pieces (approximately 1 mm3), placed in an Eppendorf tube, and washed in 1 ml of water three times for 1 h with shaking. Fifty μl of 100% acetonitrile was then added for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pieces were subsequently dried in a vacuum centrifuge for 30 min (Automatic Environmental SpeedVac System AES1010 from Savant Instruments, Inc., Holbrook, NY). Enough 10 mm dithiothreitol solution in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate to cover the gel (about 50 μl) was added, and the gel was incubated for 1 h at 56 °C in order to reduce disulfide bonds and acrylamidated cysteine moieties (36Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar). The supernatant was discarded, the same volume of 55 mm iodoacetamide solution in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate was added, and the gel was incubated for 45 min at room temperature in the dark to alkylate the free sulfhydryl groups. The supernatant was discarded, and the gel pieces were washed/rehydrated with 100 μl of 100 mmammonium bicarbonate for 10 min and dehydrated with 50 μl of 100% acetonitrile. This step was repeated once before the liquid phase was removed, and the particles were dried in the vacuum centrifuge for 30 min. The gel pieces were rehydrated with 0.1 μg/μl trypsin in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8. Just enough trypsin solution to be absorbed by the gel (∼0.6 μl/mm3 of gel) was used. The gel was incubated for 16–24 h at 37 °C. The peptides were extracted by washing three times with 20 μl of 5% formic acid in 50% acetonitrile for 45 min. The sample was dried in the vacuum centrifuge and stored at −20 °C until MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed. The sample was then dissolved in 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and deionized by repeated passages through a reversed-phase chromatographic column (ZipTipC18) (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The matrix used for peptide mapping was α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, washed essentially as described by Moore (37Moore W.T. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 289: 520-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In short, 0.2 ml of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid powder was suspended in 1.5 ml of acetone, vortexed for 10 s in an Eppendorf tube, and then centrifuged. The supernatant was discarded, and fresh acetone was added; this step was repeated twice. From the third supernatant, saturated with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 400 μl were mixed with 200 μl of nitrocellulose (38Landry F. Lombardo C.R. Smith J.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) dissolved in acetone (20 mg/ml) and 200 μl of isopropyl alcohol, to which was added 1 μl of peptide calibrants (calibration mix 1 from Applied Biosystems). Typically, 2 μl of this matrix solution was mixed with 2 μl of sample in an Eppendorf tube, and 1 μl of the mixture was spotted onto the MALDI sample plate and air-dried. The sample spot was washed once in 5% formic acid and twice in water, for 10 s each time, and air-dried again. Peptide mass spectra were acquired by MALDI-TOF MS, using a Voyager DE PRO Biospectrometry workstation (Applied Biosystems) operated in linear mode. The accelerating voltage was 20 kV; the guide wire voltage was set to 72%, and the grid voltage was set to 0.002% of the accelerating voltage. The delay time used was 100 ns. For each spectrum, 200 laser shots were averaged. Protein identification was performed by using the Protein Prospector data-mining program (available on the World Wide Web at prospector.ucst.edu) to search the SwissProt data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.expasy.ch), with a mass accuracy requirement better than 30 ppm. Cells incubated for 1 h at 37 °C were washed three times and resuspended in suspension buffer to obtain a cell density of ∼1.8 × 105cells/ml. The cells were sedimented (750 rpm for 5 min) onto microscope slides using a Cytospin cytocentrifuge (Shandon Scientific Ltd., Cheshire, UK) before being fixed in 100% methanol for 10 min at −20 °C. The cells were then washed three times with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBS-T; pH 7.5). For visualization of plectin, the cells were overlaid with monoclonal anti-plectin, diluted 1:40 in PBS-T, for 30 min. The cells were washed three times with PBS-T and overlaid with fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse antibody, diluted 1:40 in PBS-T, for 30 min in the dark. Finally, the cells were washed three times in PBS-T and twice in H2O and mounted in Mowiol. All of the antibody incubations were performed in a humid chamber at room temperature. The cells were examined in a Nikon Optihot microscope and photographed with Eastman Kodak Co. TMAX 400 film. The percentage of cells with a disrupted plectin organization was quantified by randomly choosing visual fields in the fluorescence microscope and counting 200 cells/microscope slide. The plectin networks were scored as either normal or as disrupted/altered. The activity of purified rat brain CaMK-II was measured by means of 32P incorporation into an AutoCamtide-II substrate, using an assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Protein phosphatase-inhibitory algal toxins like okadaic acid and microcystin have been shown to induce overphosphorylation and disruption of the keratin cytoskeleton in isolated rat hepatocytes and to elicit a slow apoptotic cell death preventable by the grapefruit flavonoid, naringin (8Blankson H. Grotterød E.M. Seglen P.O. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Blankson H. Holen I. Seglen P.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To identify phosphoproteins that might be involved in mediating these naringin-sensitive toxin effects, freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were treated with various concentrations (15–100 nm) of okadaic acid, in the absence or presence of naringin (100 μm). Whole-cell lysates were fractionated by electrophoresis on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels, and proteins phosphorylated at threonine groups were detected by immunostaining with an antibody directed against phosphothreonine. As shown in Fig.1 A, okadaic acid induced a dose-dependent, naringin-sensitive phosphorylation of a number of hepatocellular proteins in the molecular mass range of 35–200 kDa. The effect of okadaic acid on all of these proteins was detectable at 60 nm; on some, it was detectable even at 15 nm. The efficacy of such low toxin concentrations would seem to implicate inhibition of a type 2A protein phosphatase (1Cohen P. Holmes C.F.B. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar, 2Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar), in agreement with previous studies of okadaic acid effects in isolated rat hepatocytes (8Blankson H. Grotterød E.M. Seglen P.O. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Blankson H. Holen I. Seglen P.O. Exp.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5830-5838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The antagonistic effect of naringin was most evident at intermediate okadaic acid concentrations (30–60 nm). No effects of okadaic acid (or naringin) were seen on gels stained for total protein with Coomassie Blue (not shown), indicating that the dose-dependent changes in immunostaining intensity reflected protein phosphorylation rather than changes in protein amounts. Proteins with a molecular mass above 130 kDa were poorly separated on the 10% gels, making it difficult to assess the effects of okadaic acid and naringin in this mass region. In order to obtain better resolution of high molecular weight proteins, the cell lysates were fractionated on more dilute (5%) polyacrylamide gels, and 6m urea was included in the gel as well as in the lysate to improve protein solubility. Furthermore, a low running voltage (50–150 V) was used to avoid heating and precipitation of proteins in the gel. By this procedure, we were able to resolve several phosphoprotein bands with molecular masses above 130 kDa (Fig. 1 B). One very large (∼500-kDa) protein, which exhibited naringin-sensitive phosphorylation even at the lowest okadaic acid dose tested (15 nm), was chosen for further study. To identify the okadaic acid- and nar"

The NADH-dependent cytosolic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.8) catalyzes the conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)1 to glycerol phosphate. This reaction is reversible, with a strong preference under physiologic conditions for the production of glycerol phosphate. In the mouse, this enzyme is encoded by Gdc1. An embryonic form of the enzyme is encoded by Gdc2 but has not been found in liver or kidney during gestation, although it persists in brain of the neonate for several weeks (1Kozak L.P. Jensen J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7775-7781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in epididymal white fat for at least 5 days after birth (2Cook J.R. Kozak L.P. Dev. Biol. 1982; 92: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The FAD-dependent mitochondrial GPD (EC 1.1.99.5) is encoded by a single gene, Gdm1, on chromosome 2 (3Koza R.A. Kozak U.C. Brown L.J. Leiter E.H. MacDonald M.J. Kozak L.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and is located on the outer surface of the mitochondrial inner membrane. mGPD catalyzes the irreversible conversion of glycerol phosphate to DHAP, with transfer of electrons from bound FAD through ubiquinone to complex III of the electron transport chain. These two enzymes form the glycerol phosphate shuttle, which cycles glycerol phosphate and DHAP to oxidize NADH formed in the cytosol. A spontaneous mutation in Gdc1 in the inbred strain BALB/cHeA results in an altered mRNA size and the loss of cGPD enzyme activity (4Prochazka M. Kozak U.C. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4679-4683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cGPD-deficient BALB/cHeA animals are viable and fertile, although they demonstrate some evidence of an inhibition of glycolysis at glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase in skeletal muscle (5MacDonald M.J.

The mGPD knockout mice have decreased adiposity and reduced fertility and viability (40Brown L.J. Koza R.A. Everett C. Reitman M.L. Marshall L. Fahien L.A. Kozak L.P. MacDonald M.J. J. Biol.

Alterations are seen in liver metabolites (decreased ATP and increased glycerol phosphate) only in nursing pups. The glycerol phosphate dehydrogenases also form an important link between carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. DHAP derived from carbohydrates is converted by cGPD to glycerol phosphate, which can be acylated to form phospholipids or triglycerides. An alternate pathway, acylation of DHAP directly by dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase (7Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3458-3465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), apparently compensates for the loss of cGPD in mice of the BALB/cHeA strain, which are able to grow and produce normal fat depots, even when placed on a fat free (triglyceride/glycerol free) diet at weaning (5MacDonald M.J. Marshall L.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In tissues that contain glycerol kinase, metabolism of glycerol phosphate by mGPD should allow the conversion of glycerol to DHAP without perturbation of the cytosolic NAD/NADH ratio. DHAP is then available for either the oxidative pathway or gluconeogenesis. Under conditions of glycerol loading, mGPD appears to play a major role in glycerol oxidation (8Berry M.N. Kun E.

In the absence of both the cytosolic and mitochondrial enzymes, the link between carbohydrate and fat metabolism is extremely limited. Triglyceride glycerol can be produced from carbohydrate indirectly through the DHAP-acyltransferase pathway, however, glycerol and glycerol phosphate derived from fat are not able to enter the oxidative or gluconeogenic pathways. We report here that mice deficient in both GPDs are unable to use glycerol, developing hypoglycemia, ketonuria, glyceroluria, elevated liver glycerol phosphate, profound growth failure, and death within a week of birth. BALB/cHeA (cGPD-null) and C57BL/6J mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME. The mGPD knockouts were constructed as previously described (40Brown L.J. Koza R.A. Everett C. Reitman M.L. Marshall L. Fahien L.A. Kozak L.P. MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32892-32898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, exons 5 and 6 were replaced by a Neomycin marker gene. Targeted RW4 cells (129X1/SvJ origin) were injected into blastocysts derived from the C57BL/6J strain, and resulting chimeras were bred to C57BL/6J animals to produce heterozygous animals. Homozygous F2 or F3 mGPD knockout animals were bred with the BALB/cHeA strain to produce animals heterozygous for both the cytosolic and mitochondrial GPD deficiencies. These animals were intercrossed and typed. To simplify further breeding, animals homozygous for the cGPD deficiency and heterozygous for the mGPD knockout (co/omo/+) were intercrossed to produce animals deficient in both enzymes (co/omo/o). Additional crosses were performed to produce a c+/+m+/+ stock. Tail DNA was prepared (11Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar), and mGPD was typed using a three primer PCR (40Brown L.J. Koza R.A. Everett C. Reitman M.L. Marshall L. Fahien L.A. Kozak L.P. MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32892-32898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Typing for cGPD status was performed initially by screening for the BALB/c allele of the linked marker D15Mit242, which gives a 104-bp product from both the 129X1/SvJ and C57BL/6J alleles of the mGPD knockout mouse line, and a 90-bp product from the BALB/cHeA allele. Mouse MapPair primers were purchased from Research Genetics, Inc. (Huntsville, AL) and used according to methods provided. PCR products were separated on 3.5% Metaphor-agarose (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cGPD status was confirmed in selected cases by enzyme assay on liver homogenates using standard spectrophotometric methods (12Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis: A Practical Guide. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 262Google Scholar). Mice were routinely fed a standard chow diet (Teklad 8604, 4% fat, Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI). Mice on the C57BL/6J background were maintained on breeder chow (Teklad 8626, 10% fat). Total RNA was prepared from the interscapular brown adipose tissue using TRI-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) according to directions provided. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed using the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system and UCP1 primers as described previously (13Koza R.A. Hohmann S.M. Guerra C. Rossmeisl M. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34486-34492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Enzymes and metabolites were measured as previously described (5MacDonald M.J. Marshall L.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), except that, due to the small size of pups and organs, mouse pups were killed by beheading, and tissues for metabolites (50–100 mg) were removed as rapidly as possible and directly homogenized in 6% perchloric acid at 4 °C. Free fatty acids were measured using the Free fatty acids, Half-micro test kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), according to directions. Glucose was measured using a One-Touch Profile instrument (Lifescan, Milpitas, CA). Urine was collected by postmortem aspiration from the bladder using an insulin syringe. Acetoacetic acid was assessed semi-quantitatively on 6–10 μl of urine using Ketostix (Bayer Corp.) according to directions. Pooled urine was used for assay of electrolyte content by the University of Wisconsin Hospitals Clinical Laboratory, and individual urine samples were assayed for organic acids by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) at the University of Wisconsin Biochemical Genetics Laboratory (Madison, WI). Protein assays were performed according to the Lowry method (14Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on the sonicated pellets derived from perchloric acid precipitation. Separate determinations were made of the protein content of whole liver tissue for calculations of molarity. In a cross between the mGPD knockout strain (c+/+mo/o) and the BALB/cHeA strain (co/om+/+), 0 of 56 F2 animals were deficient in both the cytosolic and mitochondrial GPDs (co/omo/o) and GPD mo/o mice were underrepresented (6/56, expected 14/56, p < 0.05). In subsequent crosses between animals lacking cGPD and heterozygous for the mGPD knockout (co/omo/+ × co/omo/+), 0 of 61 weaned animals were mGPD knockouts (expected = 15, p < 0.001). Examination of young litters revealed discrepancies in size within a few days of birth (Fig. 1A). Runted animals, usually weighing less than 2 g at 5 days of age (versus a normal weight of 3.5 g), were confirmed to be homozygous for the mGPD deletion and lacking cGPD activity. These animals were noted to have little subcutaneous fat, although most were active and well fed for several days. By 5–7 days of age most of these GPD-deficient animals stopped feeding and were lethargic. Fig.1A may be misleading with regard to weight gain, because most of the GPD-deficient animals died within 2–7 days of birth, and those surviving longer tended to be larger than average. Similar results were found in co/omo/o pups derived from co/+mo/o intercrosses (data not shown). Analysis of pups within the first 4 days showed that mice deficient in both GPDs were born in expected numbers (23/86) and were of normal size at birth. Weights on day 1 did not differ significantly: the mean weight ± S.D. of co/omo/o pups was 1.39 ± 0.11 g (n = 9) and that of co/omo/+ was 1.43 ± 0.18 g (n = 16). Consistent with the gross appearance of the GPD-deficient pups, histology showed little, if any, subcutaneous fat in 5- to 7-day-old co/omo/o animals. Brown adipose tissue appeared normal. Other tissues showed no difference from healthy siblings, with the exception of decreased extramedullary hematopoesis in the livers of the co/omo/oanimals. Blood glucose values rose with age and weight in all pups tested, except those lacking both GPDs (Fig. 1, B and C). Data from c+/+m+/+ pups did not differ from co/omo/+ and co/om+/+animals and are not shown. There were several sporadic high blood glucose values in the co/omo/o pups, but most had low glucose values that remained near neonatal levels. Some variation in glucose values may be expected, because we did not attempt to control for feeding. Urine acetoacetate was positive in all co/omo/o pups tested (n = 19) and ranged from trace-small (5–15 mg/dl) to moderate-large (40–80 mg/dl). Ketones were negative in all other pups tested, including 29 cGPD-null, 5 mGPD knockout, 4 wild type (BALB × C57BL/6J) controls, and 3 C57BL/6J controls. Both acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate were identified by GC/MS in urine samples from two co/omo/o animals but not in urine from two control animals (co/omo/+ and co/om+/+). ATP values were reduced 40% in the co/omo/o pups versusmGPD-positive littermates, and ADP and AMP values were also proportionately reduced, with total adenylates reduced by 31–39% (Table I). ATP values were increased in cGPD-null pups (co/om+/+) versuswild controls (c+/+m+/+). Liver glycerol phosphate values were doubled in co/omo/+versus co/om+/+ and were elevated 16- to 32-fold in co/omo/o littermates. Despite the elevated liver glycerol phosphate, plasma free fatty acids were slightly elevated in the GPD-deficient animals, although the range of free fatty acid values in the GPD-deficient animals (0.38–1.35 mm) slightly exceeded that of littermate controls (0.4–1.0 mm) in both high and low values.Table ILiver metabolites and plasma free fatty acidsGPDATPADPAMPG3PFFAnmol/mg proteinmmco/om+/+10.7 ± 1.6 (5)1-ap ≤ 0.05versus co/omo/o.6.5, 7.7 (2)4.1, 1.9 (2)0.7 ± 0.1 (9)1-cp ≤ 0.001 versusco/omo/o.co/omo/+9.4 ± 0.7 (7)1-bp ≤ 0.01 versusco/omo/o.6.3 ± 0.3 (7)2.9 ± 0.5 (7)1.7 ± 0.3 (15)1-cp ≤ 0.001 versusco/omo/o.co/omo/o6.0 ± 0.4 (7)4.9 ± 0.6 (4)1.9 ± 0.5 (4)22.9 ± 1.9 (9)co/om+/+11.0 ± 0.3 (9)1-cp ≤ 0.001 versusco/omo/o.1.9 ± 0.2 (9)1-cp ≤ 0.001 versusco/omo/o.0.61 ± 0.05 (6)co/omo/+10.6 ± 0.4 (11)1-cp ≤ 0.001 versusco/omo/o.3.7 ± 0.5 (11)1-cp ≤ 0.001 versusco/omo/o.1-ep ≤ 0.01 versusco/om+/+.0.66 ± 0.07 (11)1-ap ≤ 0.05versus co/omo/o.co/omo/o6.6 ± 0.2 (11)31.0 ± 3.3 (11)0.91 ± 0.09 (15)c+/+m+/+8.8 ± 0.2 (5)1-bp ≤ 0.01 versusco/omo/o.1-ep ≤ 0.01 versusco/om+/+.1.3 ± 0.09 (5)1-dp ≤ 0.05 versusco/om+/+.0.38 ± 0.06 (3)Liver metabolites are shown as nmol/mg of protein, and free fatty acids (FFA) as mm.

Plasma and urine glycerol were elevated in all pups lacking both GPDs, and these values increased with age (Fig. 2). Values of plasma glycerol in normal animals averaged 0.8 mm, ranged from 0.2 to 1.3 mm, and did not change appreciably with age, whereas values in co/omo/o pups ranged from 10.8 to 74 mm (Fig. 2A). These values are similar to those reported in the glycerol kinase knockout mouse, which also has growth failure and dies in 3–4 days (15Huq A.H.M.M. Lovell R.S., Ou, C.-N. Beaudet A.L. Craigen W.J. Human Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1803-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In urine, no glycerol value in the co/om(+or o)/+ controls exceeded 0.4 mm, whereas values in the co/omo/opups ranged from a low of 57 mm on day 1 to a high of 478 mm (4% glycerol) on day 4 (Fig. 2B). On GC/MS, glycerol was the most prominent peak in urine from co/omo/o animals, but a minor peak in controls (data not shown). Although elevated urine glycolate was reported in glycerol kinase knockout animals (15Huq A.H.M.M. Lovell R.S., Ou, C.-N. Beaudet A.L. Craigen W.J. Human Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1803-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), no glycolate was detected in our samples. mGPD has been proposed to play a role in thermogenesis (16Lee Y.-P. Lardy H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1427-1436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lardy H., Su, C.-Y. Kneer N. Wielgus S. Lardy H. Stratman F. Hormones, Thermogenesis, and Obesity. Elsevier, New York1989: 415-426Google Scholar), however, we were unable to find a significant alteration in thermogenesis in mGPD knockout animals, which have normal UCP1 mRNA levels (40Brown L.J. Koza R.A. Everett C. Reitman M.L. Marshall L. Fahien L.A. Kozak L.P. MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32892-32898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We evaluated UCP1 mRNA in brown adipose tissue of 3- to 5-day-old pups from co/omo/+intercrosses. Pups lacking both GPDs had UCP1 mRNA levels that were reduced 60% compared with littermate controls.UCP1 mRNA levels (arbitrary units ± S.E., number in parentheses) were as follows: GPD co/om+/+, 6698† ± 372 (4Prochazka M.

Biochem. 1973; 33: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (†,p < 0.01; ‡, p < 0.001versus co/omo/o). This reduction may reflect the general poor condition of the GPD-deficient animals or the hormonal consequences of hypoglycemia. Chronic hypoglycemia would be expected to elevate corticosterone, which has been shown to inhibitUCP1 transcription (18Moriscot A. Rabelo R. Bianco A.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: E81-E87PubMed Google Scholar, 19Soumano K. Desbiens S. Rabelo R. Bakopanos E. Camirand A. Silva J.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 165: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Low UCP1 levels could impair the ability of the GPD-deficient pups to maintain body temperature. TableII shows the results of urine electrolytes performed on pooled urine from 1- to 3-day-old co/omo/o pups and two groups of controls. Results are consistent with sodium loss due to ketoacidosis, an osmotic diuresis, or proximal tubular dysfunction. Analysis of these data is limited by the lack of information on milk intake, urine output, and other electrolyte losses. The electrolyte composition of mouse milk itself is uncertain, because very different values have been reported using microelectrode methods (Na+ 76.9, K+32.5, Cl− 41.6) (20Jost B. Vilotte J.-L. Duluc I. Rodeau J.-L. Freund J.-N. Nature Biotech. 1999; 17: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and atomic absorption methods (Na+ 23.5, K+ 50.4) (21Delzer P.R. Meyer R.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1983; 35: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The GPD-deficient animals were also found to have elevated plasma proteins (114 ± 3% of littermate controls, n = 11 controls, 7 GPD-deficient, p < 0.02) and a tendency toward elevated hematocrit levels (109%, n = 3 each), consistent with the presence of severe dehydration in these animals.Table IIUrine electrolytesGenotypeAgeNa+K+Cl−OsmolaritydaysmmmosmGPD co/omo/o1–3445375485GPD co/om(o or +)/+1–315102132416GPD co/om(o or +)/+685941369Urine was collected and stored at −20 °C.

Glyceride glycerol is an especially important gluconeogenic precursor in the neonatal mouse, because 80% of calories from mouse milk are derived from fat, 16–17% from protein, and only 2–5% from lactose (20Jost B. Vilotte J.-L. Duluc I. Rodeau J.-L. Freund J.-N. Nature Biotech. 1999; 17: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,22Knight C.H. Maltz E. Docherty A.H. Comp. Biochem.

Kataoka K. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1989; 191: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus total calories available from dietary glycerol (∼4%) equal calories from lactose. Because fatty acids cannot be converted to glucose and dietary protein is needed for growth, glyceride glycerol could provide 15–25% of glucose production in the fed state, and possibly more when fasting. In GPD-deficient pups, liver glycerol kinase produces glycerol phosphate, which cannot be metabolized to dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Other substrates are therefore required for gluconeogenesis, however, gluconeogenesis from glycerol is energetically less expensive than that from amino acids and citric acid cycle intermediates. For example, production of one glucose molecule from pyruvate consumes 4 ATP, 2 GTP, and 2 mitochondrial NADH. Oxidation of each NADH could otherwise produce 3 ATPs, so the net ATP loss is 12 ATP per glucose molecule created. Synthesis of one glucose molecule from glycerol requires 2 ATP and produces either 2 FADH2 or 2 cytosolic NADH (equivalent to 2–3 ATP each), for a net gain of 2–4 ATP. In a rapidly growing animal, increased gluconeogenesis from amino acids and citric acid cycle intermediates may therefore deplete both the substrates and the energy required for growth (Fig. 3). Control of ketogenesis occurs primarily through the inhibition of carnitine palmitoyl transferase I by malonyl CoA (25McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 395-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar) and the inhibition of mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase by succinyl-CoA-dependent autosuccinylation (26Lowe D.M. Tubbs P.K. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Hegardt F.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 569-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In the presence of an elevated glucagon/insulin ratio, both inhibitions are released. The neonatal rodent, with its low sugar and high fat diet, has elevated glucagon and low levels of insulin to maintain gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation (28Girard J. Ferreá P. Peágorier J.P. Dueáe P.-H. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 507-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In the combined GPD deficiency, loss of a major gluconeogenic substrate might be expected to exaggerate this response (Fig. 3). In addition, low levels of adenylates and depletion of Pi could limit coupled respiration, slowing fatty acid oxidation in the liver of the GPD-deficient pups, and therefore increasing the proportion of acetyl-CoA used for the production of ketones (Fig. 3). The loss of ketones in the urine is coupled with an obligatory loss of cations in the urine, generally Na+, K+, and NH 4+. These losses can lead to dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and excessive protein consumption. In the absence of both GPDs, there is apparently no mechanism to prevent the accumulation of glycerol phosphate in tissues that contain glycerol kinase. In liver and kidney, glycerol phosphate is therefore produced, but cannot be converted into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and cannot be used for gluconeogenesis or aerobic metabolism. Although this glycerol phosphate could be used for lipid synthesis, lipid does not accumulate in the liver of GPD-deficient mice, most likely due to metabolic conditions favoring fatty acid degradation. It is not clear what limits the accumulation of glycerol phosphate, however, glycerol phosphate is known to be a potent product inhibitor of glycerol kinase (29Robinson J. Newsholme E.A. Biochem. J. 1969; 112: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Glycerol phosphate levels found in the liver of GPD-deficient animals (Table I) correspond to concentrations of ∼3–5 mm(calculated from the protein content of mouse pup liver of 160 mg/g of wet weight). Plasma glycerol increases up to 74 mm (normal 0.2–1.3 mm), whereas urine glycerol eventually exceeds 400 mm (normal ≤ 0.4 mm). Urine glycerol is almost completely reabsorbed by the kidney up to plasma levels of 1 mm (30Lin E.C.C. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 765-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Above this level the urine glycerol concentration depends on the plasma glycerol concentration and the degree of water reabsorption from the urine. High urine glycerol levels could lead to an osmotic diuresis, salt loss, and dehydration, consistent with our findings. Accumulation of liver glycerol phosphate may at least partially explain the low ATP and total adenylates seen in the GPD-deficient animals. In the rat, an intraperitoneal bolus of glycerol (9Burch H.B. Lowry O.H. Meinhardt L. Max P., Jr. Chyu K.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2092-2102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or liver perfusion with ethanol (31Masson S. Desmoulin F. Sciaky M. Cozzone P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) lead to the accumulation of liver glycerol phosphate to 4–14 mm. This glycerol phosphate increase is accompanied by a fall in free Pi (9Burch H.B. Lowry O.H. Meinhardt L. Max P., Jr. Chyu K.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2092-2102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Masson S. Desmoulin F. Sciaky M. Cozzone P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and a fall in liver ATP and total adenylates. The loss of adenylates is due to activation of AMP deaminase by a fall in Pi levels, and it is accompanied by a rise in the production of breakdown products of adenylate (31Masson S. Desmoulin F. Sciaky M. Cozzone P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A chronic accumulation of phosphorylated metabolites may be more deleterious. In hereditary fructose intolerance, the accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate also leads to a fall in ATP and Pi in liver and kidney. Adenylate degradation leads to the release of Mg2+ into the blood and the elevation of serum urate. In affected individuals, severe or prolonged exposure to fructose can lead to renal proximal tubular dysfunction or renal failure and to liver dysfunction, fibrosis, or liver failure. Even with minimal fructose exposure, stunted growth is common (32Gitzelmann R. Steinmann B. Van den Berghe G. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw Hill, Inc., New York1995: 905-934Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the results in our GPD-deficient animals, however, low ATP levels are also seen in the livers of mGPD knockout pups (40Brown L.J. Koza R.A. Everett C. Reitman M.L. Marshall L. Fahien L.A. Kozak L.P. MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32892-32898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), without a large increase in glycerol phosphate. Additional factors may be involved, such as an increased ATP consumption in gluconeogenesis from amino acids. Elevated glycerol phosphate may also be directly linked to the hypoglycemia observed in the GPD-deficient pups. Boluses of glycerol or glycerol phosphate interfere with gluconeogenesis from alanine, especially in malnourished animals (33Wapnir R.A. Stiel L. Biochem. Med. 1985; 33: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The mechanism is not clear. Of the gluconeogenic enzymes, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is the most susceptible to inhibition by glycerol phosphate, with an I50 of 20 mm in the rat (34Wapnir R.A. Lifshitz F. Sekaran C. Teichberg S. Moak S.A. Metabolism. 1982; 31: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and 60 mm in the Chinese hamster (35Wapnir R.A. Stiel L. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1987; 37: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). At the level of glycerol phosphate seen in our animals, a maximum inhibition of 10–30% might be expected for this enzyme. Gluconeogenesis may also be affected by the low ATP levels in the face of the increased ATP demand for gluconeogenesis from amino acids. Recently a glycerol kinase knockout mouse was reported (15Huq A.H.M.M. Lovell R.S., Ou, C.-N. Beaudet A.L. Craigen W.J. Human Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1803-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that shows a number of similarities to the GPD-deficient mouse. The glycerol kinase-deficient mouse has a normal birth weight but fails to gain weight, has plasma glycerol levels of ∼40 mm, elevated free fatty acid levels, and dies by 3–4 days of age. Unlike the GPD-deficient mice, the glycerol kinase knockout mice are not ketotic and have normal blood glucose. These differences could be attributed to the inability of the glycerol kinase-null mouse to accumulate glycerol phosphate, however, hypoglycemia and episodic ketoacidosis have been reported in patients with isolated glycerol kinase deficiency, although the human diet, including human milk, contains a higher percentage of both sugars and protein than does mouse milk. The lack of hypoglycemia and ketosis in the glycerol kinase knockout is likely attributable to the autonomous glucocorticoid secretion seen in this mouse, which should increase protein catabolism and provide the amino acid substrate needed for adequate gluconeogenesis (albeit at the expense of muscle and other tissues). Glucocorticoid treatment has been used to treat hypoglycemic ketosis of childhood (36Haymond M.W. Pagliara A.S. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1983; 12: 447-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and bovine ketosis (37Ballard F.J. Hanson R.W. Kronfeld D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 30: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), two conditions in which a paucity of gluconeogenic substrates has been postulated as the cause of symptomatic hypoglycemia and ketoacidosis. Autonomous glucocorticoid secretion has not been reported in human glycerol kinase deficiency, and caution should therefore be used in interpretation of the findings in the glycerol kinase-null mouse. Mice deficient in both the cytosolic and mitochondrial GPDs usually die within the first week of life. Hypoglycemia, ketonuria, and alterations in liver glycerol phosphate levels and ATP occur during a time period in which the mice are still active and well fed (as evidenced by stomachs full of milk), and all likely contribute to the eventual decompensation. Death may result from a combination of hypothermia, ketoacidosis, and resultant electrolyte disturbances; protein deficiency due to the obligatory use of amino acids for gluconeogenesis; glycerol-induced osmotic diuresis and dehydration; and organ failure secondary to ATP and Pidepletion."
https://openalex.org/W1988984887,"Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 2 (Psd2p) is currently being used to study lipid trafficking processes in intact and permeabilized yeast cells. The Psd2p contains a C2 homology domain and a putative Golgi retention/localization (GR) domain. C2 domains play important functions in membrane binding and docking reactions involving phospholipids and proteins. We constructed a C2 domain deletion variant (C2Δ) and a GR deletion variant (GRΔ) of Psd2p and examined their effects on in vivo function and catalysis. Immunoblotting confirmed that the predicted immature and mature forms of Psd2(C2Δ)p, Psd2(GRΔ)p, and wild type Psd2p were produced in vivo and that the proteins localized normally. Enzymology revealed that the Psd2(C2Δ)p and Psd2(GRΔ)p were catalytically active and could readily be expressed at levels 10-fold higher than endogenous Psd2p. Both Psd2p and Psd2(GRΔ)p expression complemented the growth defect ofpsd1Δpsd2Δ strains and resulted in normal aminoglycerophospholipid metabolism. In contrast, the Psd2(C2Δ)p failed to complementpsd1Δpsd2Δ strains, and [3H]serine labeling revealed a severe defect in the formation of PtdEtn in both intact and permeabilized cells, indicative of disruption of lipid trafficking. These findings identify an essential, non-catalytic function of the C2 domain of Psd2p and raise the possibility that it plays a direct role in membrane docking and/or PtdSer transport to the enzyme.

Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 391-423Google Scholar). In many species PtdSer is decarboxylated to form PtdEtn that undergoes three methyl additions to its primary amine to form PtdCho. However, in mammalian systems the methyltransferase reactions that give rise to PtdCho are restricted to the liver (3Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol.

Eukaryotes are also able to use choline and ethanolamine for the synthesis of PtdCho and PtdEtn primarily via pathways elucidated by Kennedy and co-workers (5Kennedy E.P. Weiss S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 193-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Weiss S.B. Smith S.W. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 231: 53-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can make the majority of its aminoglycerophospholipids from either a PtdSer, an Etn, or a Cho precursor (7Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 415-500Google Scholar). An intriguing aspect of aminoglycerophospholipid metabolism in eukaryotes is the segregation of the synthetic enzymes among different organelles (8Voelker D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In yeast PtdSer is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or a related membrane associated with the mitochondria (MAM) (9Carman G. Bae-Lee M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Gaigg B. Simbeni R. Hrastnik C. Paltauf F. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1234: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This nascent PtdSer must be transported to the mitochondria or the Golgi/vacuole to be converted to PtdEtn (11Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6071-6080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial PtdSer decarboxylase is denoted Psd1p, and the Golgi/vacuole enzyme is denoted Psd2p. Both Psd1p and Psd2p have been extremely useful as tools for monitoring the interorganelle traffic of nascent PtdSer (13Voelker D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recent work from this laboratory has used Psd2p to characterize some of the parameters required for interorganelle transfer of PtdSer and to identify additional genes/proteins required for the process. One protein that is required for movement of nascent PtdSer to Psd2p is a phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)-binding protein we named PstB2p (phosphatidylserine transport B2) whose encoding gene (PSTB2) was previously identified in a pleiotropic drug resistance screen and is named PDR17 (14Wu W.I. Routt S. Bankaitis V.A. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14446-14456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This same gene has also been identified as a homolog of the yeast PtdIns/PtdCho transfer protein, Sec14p, and is alternatively named SFH4 (15Bankaitis V.A. Malehorn D.E. Emr S.D. Greene R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). A second protein that has been identified in genetic screens for strains exhibiting aminoglycerophospholipid transport defects is a PtdIns 4-kinase, Stt4p (16Trotter P.J., Wu, W.I. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13189-13196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Our recent work has led us to consider the possibility that a protein complex may form on the donor and/or acceptor membranes involved in interorganelle lipid transfer processes. Some support for this general idea comes from experiments demonstrating that PstB2p must be present on acceptor membranes for PtdSer to be transferred to Psd2p (17Wu W.I. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7114-7121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this report we addressed the role of structural domains of Psd2p in the localization, catalytic activity, and in vivo function of the protein. The Psd2p has a domain with homology to the trans-Golgi protein Kex2p, which has been implicated in the localization of this protein (18Wilcox C.A. Redding K. Wright R. Fuller R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1353-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, the function of this domain in Psd2p is not clear. The Psd2p also contains a C2 domain (12Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6071-6080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The archetypical C2 domains were first identified in protein kinase C isoforms and constitute Ca2+ and phospholipid binding motifs (19Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3535) Google Scholar). Numerous other proteins involved in signal transduction and membrane trafficking possess C2 domains (20Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 21Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32407-32410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 22Hurley J.H. Misra S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 49-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In some cases C2 domains bind lipids or membranes in Ca2+ independent reactions. C2 domains are also known to promote both protein-protein and protein-phosphoinositide interactions. The role of the C2 domain in Psd2p function has not previously been examined and has remained unclear. The purpose of this study was to perform structure/function analyses of Psd2p using biochemistry and genetics. In this report we sought to do the following: 1) define the processing of Psd2p required for its maturation, 2) determine the role of the GR domain in processing, catalysis, targeting, and in vivo function of Psd2p, and 3) determine the role of the C2 domain in the processing, catalysis, targeting, and in vivo function of Psd2p. Our findings indicate that the GR domain is dispensable for all functions examined. In contrast, the C2 domain is not required for processing, catalysis, or targeting but is essential for in vivo function. Simple salts, buffers, and amino acids were purchased from Sigma and Fisher. Yeast media components including yeast extract, nitrogen base without amino acids, and peptone were from Difco. Zymolase-100T was from US Biological. The radiochemicals [3-3H]serine and [1-14C]serine were fromAmersham Biosciences and American Radiolabeled Chemicals. The 1-acyl-2-[6-[(7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4yl)amino]caproyl-Ptd-[1′-14C]serine (NDB-Ptd-[1′-14C]serine) was synthesized using bacterial PtdSer synthase (23Ohta A. Waggoner K. Louie K. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2219-2225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (24Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7069-7074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid standards were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. PTY44 (MATαtrp1 ura3 his3 lys2 leu2 psd1-Δ1::TRP1 psd2-Δ1::HIS3) and PTY41 (MATαtrp1 ura3 his3 lys2 leu2 psd1-Δ1::TRP1) strains were previously established in our laboratory. The synthetic complete growth medium for yeast containing all amino acids (SC) was prepared by standard methods. Additional adenine and uracil (20 mg/liter) were also routinely added to SC. Etn was added from 0.5 m, pH 6–7, sterile stock solution to yield SCE (2 mm). All yeast cells were cultured at 30 °C in a temperature-controlled incubator. YEp352-PSD2/GRΔ and YEP352-PSD2/C2Δ, yeast expression vectors containing a 3′-linked HA-epitope tag sequence, were constructed by the overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method (25Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6849) Google Scholar). Briefly, genomic DNA from a SEY6210 yeast strain and PCR primers specifically designed to delete the GR or C2 region in the PSD2 gene were mixed and amplified with a thermal cycler by using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The PSD2/GRΔ orPSD2/C2Δ DNA PCR products containingPstI restriction enzyme sites located 5′ and 3′ to the sequence of interest were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis afterPstI digestion. The YEp352-PSD2 yeast expression vector constructed in a previous study (12Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6071-6080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) was also digested withPstI, and the resultant DNA fragments were purified by electrophoresis. Next, the appropriate pieces of DNA were ligated to yield YEP352-PSD2/GRΔ and YEp352-PSD2/C2Δ. The desired plasmids were cloned in Escherichia coli (XL-1 Blue, Stratagene) and purified. The sequences of the final constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing. The PTY44 (psd1Δpsd2Δ) strain was the recipient for the YEp352-PSD2, YEp352PSD2/GRΔ and YEp352-PSD2/C2Δ constructs. The PTY44 cells were transformed with the vectors using the LiAc method described in the YeastmakerTM Transformation System (CLONTECH, CA). After the selection on SCE minus uracil (SCE -U) plates, a positive clone for each variant was incubated with SCE -U liquid media at 30 °C overnight to give anA600 of ∼0.6. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with distilled water, and homogenized with glass beads using a Beadbeater (Biospec Products) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 0.25 m sucrose, 0.5 mmEDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.0. Total cell-free extracts were then prepared by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min. Each extract, containing 75 μg of protein, was used for Western blot analysis to confirm the protein expression level. Electrophoresis was performed with Tris-glycine gels (8–16%, 1 mm ×12 wells, Invitrogen), and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The proteins were detected with a rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (3F10, Roche), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG polyclonal antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in conjunction with ECL reagents (Sigma). Psd2p enzyme activity was measured by the 14CO2 trapping method with modifications (26Trotter P.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6062-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). An aliquot of total cell-free extract from each of the different strains, containing 5 μg of protein, was used for the enzyme assay. The extracts were mixed with NBD-Ptd[1′-14C]serine (80,000 cpm) in the reaction buffer (25 mm KPO4, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 150 mm KCl, pH 7.0) and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. The 14CO2 produced by the decarboxylation of NBD-Ptd[1′-14C]serine was trapped on filter paper saturated with 100 μl of 2 m KOH. The reaction was terminated by acidification with 0.25 mH2SO4, and the mixture was incubated further at 30 °C for 1 h. The 14C-containing filter paper was placed in 0.5 ml of H2O plus 4.5 ml of ScintiSafeTM 30% (Fisher) and incubated at 50 °C for 30 min. The radioactivity bound to the filter paper was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The parental PTY44 strain and its derivatives harboring YEp352-PSD2, YEp352-PSD2/GRΔ, and YEp352-PSD2/C2Δ plasmids were cultured on plates supplemented with Etn (SCE -U) or without Etn (SC -U). Each of the strains (1 × 106 cells) was streaked on one of four areas of the plate and incubated at 30 °C for 2.5 days. These strains were also inoculated into liquid SCE -U or SC -U at an initialA600 of 0.02 and grown at 30 °C with shaking. The OD600 of the culture media was continuously monitored for 72 h to assess the growth in liquid medium. PTY44, PTY41, and PTY44 strains transformed to express wild type and mutant PSD2 genes from high copy plasmids were grown overnight to log phase with SCE or SCE -U. After the cells were washed twice with sterile distilled water they were diluted to 2 × 106/ml in the aforementioned medium containing 20 μCi/ml ofl-[3-3H]serine (32 Ci/mmol) without Etn and non-radioactive serine. The cultures were incubated for 4 h at 30 °C with shaking. At the end of the incubation, an aliquot of a 50% trichloroacetic acid solution was added to give a final concentration of 5%. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed three times with distilled water. The resultant pellet was subjected to lipid extraction (17Wu W.I. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7114-7121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Total lipids were analyzed by thin layer chromatography on silica gel H plates (UniplateTM, Analtech, Inc., DE) using a solvent system containing chloroform, methanol, 2-propyl alcohol, 0.25% aqueous KCl, and triethylamine (30:9:25:6:18, v/v/v/v/v). Individual phospholipids were identified under ultraviolet light by comigration with authentic standards (PtdSer, PtdEtn, PtdCho, and PtdIns) after the plates were sprayed with 0.2% 8-anilino-1-napthalene sulfonic acid. The lipids were scraped into vials containing scintillation fluid (ScintiSafeTM30%), and the radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Permeabilized cells were prepared in a lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 0.15m potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.4 m sorbitol, pH 6.8) following the method described by Achleitner et al. (31Achleitner G. Zweytick D. Trotter P.J. Voelker D.R. Daum G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29836-29842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In brief, yeast spheroplasts were prepared by treating cells with dithiothreitol under alkaline conditions followed by zymolyase treatment. The resulting spheroplasts were regenerated for 20 min at 30 °C in the presence of 0.75% yeast extract, 1.5% peptone, 1% glucose, and 0.7 m sorbitol before they were washed and then resuspended in lysis buffer at a concentration of 0.5 g wet weight/ml. The cell suspensions were divided into 0.2–0.3-ml aliquots and frozen over liquid nitrogen vapor for 15 min. The frozen cells could be stored at −80 °C for at least 3 months. The cells were thawed slowly on ice for 1 h prior to use in transport reactions. [3H]Serine was incorporated into the permeabilized cells in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 8 mm HEPES, 22 mm Tris-HCl, 0.6 mm MnCl2, 0.6 mm magnesium acetate, 60 mm potassium acetate, 0.1 m KCl, 8.5 mm β-choroalanine, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm MgCTP, 0.28 m sorbitol, 0.27 mmannitol, 50 μml-serine, 30 μCi/ml [3H]serine, pH 8.0, by the same method described previously (17Wu W.I. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7114-7121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The final protein concentration of the permeabilized cells in the transport reaction was 0.9 mg/ml. The assay mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 100 min. The incorporation of [3H]serine was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of methanol, 0.5 ml CHCl3, and 0.3 ml of 0.2 m KCl to generate a monophase. The extraction was completed by the further addition of 0.45 ml of 0.2 m KCl and 0.5 ml CHCl3 to create two phases that were separated by centrifugation. After aspiration of the upper phase, the lower chloroform phase was further washed with 1.9 ml of methanol/phosphate-buffered saline (1:0.9, v/v) twice. The resulting chloroform phase was dried under nitrogen gas, resuspended in 30 μl of chloroform/methanol (9:1, v/v), and analyzed by thin layer chromatography as described above. The ratio of PtdEtn/PtdSer + PtdEtn was used as a transport index for PtdSer. The permeabilized cells were prepared from strains harboringPSD2/GRΔ, PSD2/C2Δ, and PSD2 genes on YEp352 plasmids as described above. The fractionation procedure used methods previously described (14Wu W.I. Routt S. Bankaitis V.A. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14446-14456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was immediately homogenized gently on ice with 15 strokes using the B pestle of a Dounce homogenizer. The cell debris was removed from the homogenate by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min to remove dense membranes. The supernatant was removed from the pellet, overlaid on a two-step gradient consisting of 1 ml of 80% sorbitol and 1 ml of 25% sorbitol, and centrifuged for 2 h at 280,000 ×g in a Beckman SW41 rotor. All sorbitol densities are given as the w/v in 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.2. The interface between the 25 and 80% sorbitol layers was collected and adjusted to 43% sorbitol using refractometry and layered on a gradient prepared in 40, 43, 60, 70, and 80% increments. The 40% step was 3.6 ml, and the 80% step was 1 ml. All other gradient steps were 2.3 ml each. Membranes were separated by centrifuging the gradient in an SW41 rotor at 280,000 × g for 40 h. Fractions were collected by aspiration from the top of the gradient and stored at −20 °C. The yeast PtdSer decarboxylases contain several distinct structural domains as outlined in Fig. 1. The yeast Psd1p is organized in a similar manner to the mammalian enzyme that has been shown to be sequentially processed to yield mitochondrial outer- and inner-membrane transit intermediates and finally mature α- and β-subunits (32Kuge O. Saito K. Kojima M. Akamatsu Y. Nishijima M. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The generation of α- and β-subunits in the eukaryotic enzymes is predicted to proceed via endoproteolytic cleavage of α- and β-subunits by a serinolysis mechanism that generates the pyruvoyl prosthetic group essential for catalysis. Predictions for eukaryotic processing are derived from definitive work performed with the E. coli enzyme that demonstrates cleavage between Glu and Ser residues residing in an LGST motif (33Li Q.X. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11516-11522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast Psd2p contains a GGST motif that is proposed to be the cleavage site for generating α- and β-subunits (12Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6071-6080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 13Voelker D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition to predicted α- and β-subunits, Psd2p contains within the β-subunit a putative Golgi localization/retention motif similar to that found in the Golgi protease Kex2p (18Wilcox C.A. Redding K. Wright R. Fuller R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1353-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and a C2 homology domain similar to that found in protein kinase C and synaptotagmin (20Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar,21Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32407-32410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Analysis of C-terminal HA epitope-tagged versions of Psd2p shown in Fig. 2 reveals that the wild type protein is detectable as a 130-kDa precursor that is processed to yield a mature α-subunit of ∼11 kDa. The size of the α-subunit is entirely consistent with the structural predictions from sequence data. The Psd2(GRΔ)p and the Psd2(C2Δ)p are identifiable as smaller molecular size precursors of ∼127 and 117 kDa, respectively. Both the Psd2(GRΔ)p and the Psd2(C2Δ)p are processed to yield the mature α-subunit required for catalysis. From these data we conclude that the two structural mutants we have constructed are processed to the mature form of the protein in a process that is essentially indistinguishable from that occurring with the wild type protein. A minor immunoreactive band of slightly higher molecular size is also observed in the region of the α-subunit. The exact identity of this component is not known, but based upon the reaction sequence of pyruvoyl enzymes (13Voelker D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), it is probably the α-subunit containing PtdSer or PtdEtn in Schiff’s base linkage to the active site. To determine whether the Psd2( GRΔ)p and Psd2(C2Δ)p expressed in yeast cells are catalytically active, we performed enzyme assays using cell-free extracts from the different strains. Total cell-free extracts derived from strains lacking PtdSer decarboxylases (psd1Δpsd2Δ) or expressing only Psd2p from the chromosome (psd1Δ PSD2) or expressing only high copy Psd2p, Psd2(GRΔ)p or Psd2(C2Δ)p were compared. As shown in Fig. 3, thepsd1Δ psd2Δ strain had no decarboxylase activity, and the strain expressing Psd2p from the chromosome had the low but measurable activity previously described (12Trotter P.J.

High level expression of Psd2p gave 15 times the enzyme activity of the control strain (PTY41) expressing only the chromosomal copy. The Psd2(GRΔ)p and Psd2(C2Δ)p showed catalytic activity 12 and 10 times higher than that obtained for the chromosomal copy of the wild type gene. These data indicate that the Psd2(GRΔ)p and the Psd2(C2Δ)p are catalytically active and can be expressed at very high levels within the yeast. These data clearly demonstrate that neither the GR domain nor the C2 domain are required to produce a catalytically functional enzyme. Subcellular fractionation of the permeabilized and homogenized cells was performed by density gradient centrifugation to define the localization of the Psd2(GRΔ)p, Psd2(C2Δ)p, and Psd2p expressed in yeast cells. The yeast strains were permeabilized and fractionated, and the localization of mature and immature Psd2p in fractionated samples was revealed by Western blot with anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig.4, the bands corresponding to the mature α-subunit of Psd2p, Psd2(GRΔ)p, and Psd2(C2Δ)p were observed from fractions 13 to 18, with the peak of the expression at fraction 16. Within the limits of resolution of this centrifugation method, we conclude that the subcellular localization of the Psd2p variants is identical to the wild type protein. The bands corresponding to immature forms of the decarboxylases were also centered around fraction 16, demonstrating that processing of Psd2p to the mature form is not required before localization. In addition, an 80-kDa band was detected in the peak fractions for both mature and immature Psd2p and Psd2(C2Δ)p, but not in those of Psd2(GRΔ)p. It is likely that the ∼80-kDa protein is a proteolytic product of the immature Psd2p and Psd2(C2Δ)p. This ∼80-kDa band could be a spurious proteolytic product, but it may also be generated from a specific cleavage within the GR domain. The identical distribution of Psd2p, Psd2(GRΔ)p, and Psd2(C2Δ)p strongly suggests that the deletion of either the GR domain or the C2 domain does not affect either the maturation or the localization of Psd2p. Thus, the GR and C2 domains do not participate in targeting the decarboxylase to its subcellular location. We next examined whether the Psd2(C2Δ)p and Psd2(GRΔ)p could replace the wild type enzyme in vivo. In these studies strains lacking chromosomal copies of PtdSer decarboxylases (psd1Δpsd2Δ)were transformed with high copy plasmids encoding either Psd2p, Psd2(GRΔ)p, or Psd2(C2Δ)p. Under the conditions used, cell growth is absolutely dependent upon the in vivo function of Psd2p when Etn is omitted from the medium. When Etn is included in the medium, cells can bypass the need for Psd2p function by synthesizing PtdEtn by the Kennedy pathway (5Kennedy E.P. Weiss S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 193-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Weiss S.B. Smith S.W. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 231: 53-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wu W.I.

High copy plasmids were chosen for this experiment to bias the results to reveal complementation of the PtdSer decarboxylase null mutant even with weakly active forms of the Psd2p variants lacking either the GR or C2 domains. In Fig. 5,A and B results are presented from experiments conducted with solid and liquid media, respectively. In the presence of Etn (permissive conditions) all strains harboring a plasmid bearing a Psd2p variant were capable of growing on either solid or liquid medium. In the absence of Etn (non-permissive conditions) the Psd2p- and Psd2(GRΔ)p-expressing strains grew equally well on both solid and liquid medium, and the growth was comparable to that found under permissive conditions. In contrast to the other constructs, the Psd2(C2Δ)p variant was unable to support growth on either solid or liquid medium in the absence of Etn. These data clearly demonstrate that the C2 domain of Psd2p plays an essential role in thein vivo function of the enzyme. The inability of the Psd2(C2Δ)p to support cell growth, despite high level catalytic activity and normal subcellular localization, suggested a defect in the transport-dependent decarboxylation of PtdSer. We next examined the effects of the Psd2p structural variants on aminophospholipid metabolism in vivo. In these experiments, shown in Fig. 6, cells were labeled for 1–2 generations with [3H]serine in the absence of Etn. The majority of [3H]serine is directly incorporated into the head groups of aminophospholipids via the de novosynthesis of PtdSer. In psd1Δpsd2Δ strains lacking the decarboxylases, PtdSer is synthesized. However, there is little PtdSer turnover, and there is a marked defect in the formation of PtdEtn. The residual PtdEtn formed inpsd1Δpsd2Δ strains occurs via sphingolipid labeli"

The first step in assembly is the ATP-dependent and hsp40 (YDJ-1)-dependent binding of hsp70 to the GR, which primes the receptor for subsequent ATP-dependent activation by hsp90, Hop, and p23 (Morishima, Y., Murphy, P. J. M., Li, D. P., Sanchez, E. R., and Pratt, W. B. (2000)J. Biol. Chem. 275, 18054–18060). Here we have examined the nucleotide-bound states of the two essential chaperones in each step. We show that it is the ATP-bound state of hsp70 that interacts initially with the GR. After rapid priming and washing, the primed GR·hsp70 complex rapidly binds hsp90 in the second step reaction in a nucleotide-independent manner. The rate-limiting step is the ATP-dependent opening of the steroid binding cleft after hsp90 binding. This activating step requires the N-terminal ATP-binding site of hsp90, but we cannot establish any role for a C-terminal ATP-binding site in steroid binding cleft opening. The reported specific inhibitors of the C-terminal ATP site on hsp90 inhibit the generation of steroid binding, but they have other effects in this multiprotein system that could explain the inhibition.

The receptor·hsp90 heterocomplexes can be formed by incubating immunoadsorbed, hsp90-free receptors with reticulocyte lysate (3Smith D.F. Showalter D.B. Kost S.L. Toft D.O. Mol.

Because the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) must be bound to hsp90 for the receptor to have high affinity steroid binding activity (1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar), incubation of the hsp90-free GR with reticulocyte lysate results in generation of steroid binding activity in direct proportion to the number of GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes that are assembled (5Hutchison K.A. Czar M.J. Scherrer L.C. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14047-14053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, generation of steroid binding activity provides a functional assay for proper heterocomplex assembly. Both biochemical data (6Stancato L.F. Silverstein A.M. Gitler C. Groner B. Pratt W.B. J.

The assembly of receptor·hsp90 heterocomplexes is an ATP-dependent process that is carried out by a multiprotein system that is apparently ubiquitous among cells of the animal and plant kingdoms (1Pratt W.B.

Hsp90 and hsp70 are both essential for opening the steroid binding cleft, and Hop, hsp40, and p23 act as co-chaperones that increase the rate or extent of GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly (12Morishima Y.

Hop (hsp70/hsp90 organizing protein) binds via different TPR domains to hsp70 and hsp90 (13Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honoreá B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), bringing these two essential chaperones together into a machinery. The machinery as it is immunoadsorbed from reticulocyte lysate also contains the hsp70 co-chaperone hsp40 (10Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and it has all of the activity required for converting the GR LBD to the steroid binding state (10Dittmar K.D.

All of the Hop and ∼30% of the hsp90 in reticulocyte lysate exist in this hsp90·Hop·hsp70·hsp40 complex (15Murphy P.J.M. Kanelakis K.C. Galigniana M.D. Morishima Y. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

Receptor-bound hsp90 must achieve the ATP-bound conformation for the receptor to be in the steroid binding state (17Grenert J.P. Johnson B.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17525-17533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and when this state is achieved, p23, which binds only to ATP-bound hsp90 (18Sullivan W. Stensgard B.

Acting separately, hsp70 and hsp90 are classically thought of as chaperones that bind to denatured regions of proteins to promote their refolding. However, there is no evidence that steroid receptors that have been stripped of hsp90 by mild salt treatment are in any way denatured prior to their reactivation by the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery. When hsp90 and hsp70 are acting together in this machinery, they act at a very focal site on the surface of the LBD (7Xu M. Dittmar K.D. Giannoukos G. Pratt W.B. Simons S.S., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13918-13924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) of the native GR to open the hydrophobic steroid binding cleft to access by hormone. In initial experiments to understand the mechanism of cleft opening and GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly, we have carried out two-step reactions in which the immunoadsorbed GR is first incubated with purified hsp70 and YDJ-1 (the yeast hsp40 homolog) in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system (20Morishima Y. Murphy P.J.M., Li, D-P. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18054-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This produces a GR·hsp70 complex that can be washed free of unbound hsp70 and then incubated with purified hsp90, Hop, and p23. In this first reaction the GR is “primed” to be activated by hsp90 during the second incubation. Both the initial priming step with hsp70 and the second activating step with hsp90 are ATP-dependent, and steroid binding activity is generated only during the second step (20Morishima Y. Murphy P.J.M., Li, D-P. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18054-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The two-step assembly differs somewhat from single step assembly when all five proteins are present simultaneously in the respect that the priming reaction with hsp70 is highly dependent upon the presence of YDJ-1 (21Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J.M. Shewach D.S. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas the single step assembly is less dependent upon YDJ-1 (12Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Silverstein A.M.

To advance our understanding of the assembly process, it is important to determine what nucleotide binding state of hsp70 interacts initially with the GR and what state of hsp90 interacts with the primed GR·hsp70 complex. On the basis of indirect evidence, we have previously speculated that hsp70 binds to the GR in its ATP-bound form (20Morishima Y. Murphy P.J.M., Li, D-P. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18054-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and in this work, we demonstrate that it is the ATP-bound state of hsp70 that interacts initially with the hsp90-free GR. In the second assembly step, binding of hsp90 is rapid, and the rate-limiting step is the ATP-dependent opening of the steroid binding cleft. We do not detect any difference between the ATP-bound, the ADP-bound, and the unbound state of hsp90 in the ability to bind to the primed GR·hsp70 complex. In addition to the N-terminal ATP-binding site that acts as a conformational switch (23Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Clark J. Mimnaugh E. Krutzsch H. Ochel H.J. Schulte T.W.

Using inhibitors reported to be specific for one site or the other, we confirm a requirement of the N-terminal site for GR activation. However, when the GR is activated by the multiprotein machinery, we find that other effects of C-terminal inhibitors, such as inhibition of hsp70 function, do not permit determination of any requirement for ATP binding at the C-terminal site on hsp90.

Geldanamycin was obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch of the Developmental Therapeutics Program, NCI, National Institutes of Health. Sf9 cells were grown in SFM900 II serum-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with Cytomax (Kemp Biotechnology, Rockville, MD) in suspension cultures maintained at 27 °C with continuous shaking (150 rpm). Cultures were supplemented with 0.1% glucose at infection and 24 h post-infection as described by Srinivasan et al. (28Srinivasan G. Post J.F.M. Thompson E.B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 60: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, washed in Hanks’ buffered saline solution, resuspended in 1.5 volumes of buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.35, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm molybdate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with 1 tablet of Complete-Mini protease inhibitor mixture per 3 ml of buffer, and ruptured by Dounce homogenization. The lysate was then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected, aliquoted, flash-frozen, and stored at −70 °C. Receptors were immunoadsorbed from 50-μl aliquots of Sf9 cytosol by rotation for 2 h at 4 °C with 14 μl of protein A-Sepharose precoupled to 7 μl of FiGR ascites suspended in 200 μl of TEG buffer (10 mm TES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). Prior to incubation with various mixtures of purified proteins as noted, immunoadsorbed receptors were stripped of associated hsp90 by incubating the immunopellet for an additional 2 h at 4 °C with 300 μl of 0.5 m NaCl in TEG buffer. The pellets were then washed once with 1 ml of TEG buffer followed by a second wash with 1 ml of Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.35). For single step assembly of GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes, FiGR immunopellets containing GR stripped of chaperones were incubated with the five-protein assembly system (20 μg of purified hsp90, 15 μg of purified hsp70, 0.6 μg of purified human Hop, 6 μg of purified p23, 0.4 μg of purified YDJ-1) adjusted to 50 μl with HKD buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.35, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol), containing 20 mm sodium molybdate and 5 μl of an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm ATP, 250 mmcreatine phosphate, 20 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 units/ml creatine phosphokinase). The assay mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with suspension of the pellets by shaking the tubes every 2 min. At the end of the incubation, the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold TEGM buffer (TEG with 20 mmsodium molybdate) and assayed for steroid binding capacity and for receptor-associated hsp90 and hsp70. For two-step assembly, stripped GR immune pellets were mixed with hsp70, YDJ-1, and the ATP-regenerating system in a final volume of 55 μl adjusted with HKD buffer. After 5 min of incubation at 30 °C, the pellets were washed twice with TEG buffer and once with Hepes buffer and then incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with the purified heterocomplex assembly system without hsp70. At the end of the second incubation, steroid binding was assayed. Immune pellets to be assayed for steroid binding were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 50 μl of HEM buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.35, 1 mmEDTA, 20 mm molybdate) plus 50 nm[3H]triamcinolone acetonide. Samples were then washed three times with 1 ml of TEGM buffer and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The steroid binding is expressed in counts per min of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide bound/FiGR immunopellet prepared from 50 μl of Sf9 cytosol. To assay GR and associated proteins, immune pellets were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were probed with 0.25 μg/ml BuGR for GR, 1 μg/ml AC88 for hsp90, or 1 μg/ml N27F3-4 for hsp70. The immunoblots were then incubated a second time with the appropriate 125I-conjugated or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated counterantibody to visualize the immunoreactive bands. hsp90 and hsp70 were purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate by sequential chromatography on DE52, hydroxyapatite, and ATP-agarose as described previously (29Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Czar M.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5043-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human p23 was purified from 10 ml of bacterial lysate by chromatography on DE52 followed by hydroxyapatite chromatography as described (30Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

Purification of human Hop was carried out in a similar manner by sequential chromatography on DE52 and hydroxyapatite. In all cases the protein-containing fractions were identified by immunoblotting, and fractions from the final purification step were pooled, concentrated by Amicon filtration, dialyzed against HKD buffer, flash-frozen, and stored at −70 °C. Purified rabbit hsp90 was incubated with 5 mm ATP, 5 mmADP, or with HKD buffer alone for 10 min at 30 °C. Following the incubation, 17 μg of hsp90 protein was subjected to four rounds of charcoal adsorption to remove free nucleotide. Bound nucleotides were extracted with ice-cold 0.4 n perchloric acid from purified hsp90. The ATP and ADP were then separated and quantitated by strong anion-exchange, high performance liquid chromatography using a Waters (Milford, MA) gradient system controlled by Millenium software as described previously (32Boucher P.D. Ruch R.J. Shewach D.S. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were loaded onto a 5 μm Partisphere 4.6 × 250 mm SAX column (Whatman, Hillsboro, OR), and nucleotides were eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium phosphate buffer ranging from 0.15 (pH 3.6) to 0.60 m (pH 3.8) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Retention times were 7.7 min and 23.3 min for ADP and ATP, respectively. Nucleotides were identified by their absorbance between 240 and 350 nm using a Waters photodiode array detector. ADP and ATP were quantitated by comparison of their peak areas with that of a known amount of appropriate standard at wavelengths 254 and 281. The concentration of purified hsp90 was determined by Bradford assay. All perchloric acid extracts were filtered prior to the high performance liquid chromatography step, and after correcting for the amount of nucleotide removed during filtration, the percent of the protein that could be accounted for in the nucleotide-bound form was calculated. In the samples of Fig. 3, we can say that at least 60% of the hsp90 is converted to the ATP-bound form and at least 28% to the ADP-bound form. hsp90-stripped GR immune pellets were incubated with YDJ-1 and an ATP-regenerating system in the presence (primed) or absence (unprimed) of hsp70 for 5 min at 30 °C. The immunopellets were then washed once with TEG buffer and once with Hepes buffer. Purified hsp90 was preincubated for 10 min at 30 °C with 5 mm ATP, 5 mm ADP, or HKD buffer. The washed unprimed or primed GR·hsp70 pellets were then incubated for 30 s at 30 °C with each preparation of preincubated hsp90 in the presence of Hop, YDJ-1, p23, and molybdate and in the presence of 0.01% Nonidet P-40 to reduce nonspecific binding. The pellets were then washed three times with TG buffer (8 mm TES, 25 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol (w/v) pH 7.6) and immunoblotted for GR, hsp90, and hsp70. We have previously shown that our purified hsp70 is predominantly (∼90%) in the ATP-bound state (21Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J.M. Shewach D.S. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic DnaJ homologs, like YDJ-1, bind to hsp70 to activate its ATPase activity and convert the chaperone to the ADP-dependent conformation, which binds hydrophobic peptide substrate (33Minami Y. Hofeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). To determine whether it is the ATP-bound or ADP-bound state of hsp70 that initially interacts with the salt-stripped, hsp90-free GR, purified hsp70 was preincubated at 30 °C with an ATP-regenerating system to maintain the ATP-bound state, or it was incubated with YDJ-1 to convert it to the ADP-bound conformation. In the experiment of Fig.1, immune pellets with stripped GR were incubated on ice with the preincubated samples of hsp70, and the pellets were then washed. It can be seen that untreated hsp70 bound to the receptor, and the amount of binding was increased when hsp70 was preincubated with the ATP-regenerating system (EGS). Preincubation of hsp70 with YDJ-1 essentially eliminated binding to the receptor, and we conclude that the ADP-bound conformation of hsp70 does not recognize the GR. These data are consistent with the ATP-dependent form of hsp70 being the form that interacts initially with the receptor. The receptor is primed in the initial step by incubating with both YDJ-1 and the ATP-regenerating system (21Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J.M. Shewach D.S. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and as shown in Fig. 1, hsp70 that is preincubated under this condition also binds to the receptor. We have previously assayed nucleotide in the complex after the priming reaction and find that approximately one-third of the GR-bound hsp70 is bound by ADP and approximately two-thirds is bound by ATP (21Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J.M. Shewach D.S. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of hsp70 is minimal in the absence of K+(34O'Brien M.C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2247-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and we have shown that priming of the receptor by hsp70 is K+-dependent (21Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J.M. Shewach D.S. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). hsp70 is typically purified as a dimer (35Sadis S. Hightower L.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9406-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and ATP hydrolysis is reported to dissociate dimers to monomers (36Schmid S.L. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10057-10062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our purified hsp70 behaves as a dimer on gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions (15Murphy P.J.M. Kanelakis K.C. Galigniana M.D. Morishima Y. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30092-30098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and we have reported the stoichiometry of the primed GR·hsp70 complex to be ∼1.1 molecule of hsp70 bound per molecule of GR (20Morishima Y. Murphy P.J.M., Li, D-P. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18054-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with a priming step in which purified hsp70 in its ATP-dependent conformation binds to the GR, probably initially as a dimer. During the priming reaction, which occurs very rapidly (within 1 min at 30 °C) (21Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J.M. Shewach D.S. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), YDJ-1-stimulated ATPase activity converts it to a GR·hsp70 complex containing one (certainly no more than two) molecule of hsp70 that can now accept hsp90 in the subsequent activating step with the hsp70-free assembly system. The initial GR·hsp70 complex shown in Fig. 1 is different from the primed complex, in that no steroid binding activity is generated when it is incubated with the hsp70-free assembly system. Because this temperature-dependent and K+-dependent priming step requires both YDJ-1 and sustained high levels of ATP for optimal activity, we have suggested that the GR-bound hsp70 may ratchet between ATP- and ADP-dependent conformations as it primes the receptor (21Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J.M. Shewach D.S. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observation (21Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J.M. Shewach D.S. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that both ATP- and ADP-bound hsp70 are recovered in the primed complex. We have previously proposed that hsp90 binds to the primed GR·hsp70 complex in its ADP-bound state (20Morishima Y. Murphy P.J.M., Li, D-P. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18054-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The purified hsp90 that we use is not bound by nucleotide (21Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J.M. Shewach D.S. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but this form may be the same as the ADP-bound state in terms of the overall conformation of hsp90 (18Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Scheibel et al. (37Scheibel T. Neuhofen S. Weikl T. Mayr C. Reinstein J. Vogel P.D. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18608-18613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have calculated that about 70% of the hsp90 in cells would be in the ATP-bound form; thus, we wanted to find out what form of hsp90 binds to the primed GR·hsp70 complex. In the experiment of Fig. 2, purified hsp90 was preincubated at 30 °C with buffer, ATP, or ADP, and the mixtures were added to unprimed GR pellets or to primed GR·hsp70 complexes. After 30 s at 30 °C, the pellets were washed and immunoblotted. All three of the hsp90 preparations bound to the primed GR·hsp70 complex. Purified hsp90 that was preincubated with nucleotide under the same conditions was assayed for bound nucleotide. As shown in Fig. 3, our purified hsp90 is in nucleotide-free form, and preincubation with ATP or ADP converts a significant portion to the ATP- or ADP-bound form. In Fig. 2, it appears that somewhat less of the ADP-preincubated sample is bound, but over several experiments we cannot detect any difference in the amount of hsp90 that binds to the primed GR·hsp70 complex when the hsp90 is added in the unbound, ADP-bound, or ATP-bound state. We have shown previously that unbound, ADP-bound, and ATP-bound preparations of hsp90 all yield the same rate of generation of steroid binding activity when added to the second step reaction mixture (21Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J.M. Shewach D.S. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, the primed GR·hsp70 complex does not appear to bind preferentially a particular nucleotide-bound state of hsp90 when it is added under the second step conditions where Hop is present. Inasmuch as purified Hop has been reported to bind preferentially to hsp90 that is in the unbound or ADP-bound state (38Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), this result was unexpected. To determine what step is rate-limiting for assembly of steroid-binding GR·hsp90 complexes, we performed a time course of the second step reaction. In the experiment of Fig. 4A, unprimed receptors and primed GR·hsp70 complexes were incubated under second step conditions with hsp90, Hop, YDJ-1, and p23. At the indicated times, samples were assayed for both steroid binding and hsp90 binding. It is clear that binding of hsp90 to the primed GR·hsp70 complex is rapid, and steroid binding activity increases more slowly. As reported previously (20Morishima Y. Murphy P.J.M., Li, D-P. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18054-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), hsp70 dissociates from the receptor during the second step reaction. In the procedure of Fig. 4A, the pellets are washed after the second step incubation and then incubated with steroid to assay steroid binding activity. This procedure assays the formation of stable GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes that remain intact during subsequent incubation with steroid. To be sure that we measure the rate of steroid binding cleft opening, we carried out the second step reaction at 30 °C in the presence of steroid (Fig. 4B). Under these conditions, as soon as the steroid binding cleft is opened, the steroid enters and binds, yielding a direct estimate of the rate of cleft opening. Steroid binding is generated only when the ATP regenerating system is present. Thus, cleft opening is ATP-dependent and is the rate-limiting step. Although the second step in which the primed GR·hsp70 complex is activated by hsp90 to the steroid binding state is ATP-dependent (20Morishima Y. Murphy P.J.M., Li, D-P. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18054-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), it is not known whether one ATP binding site or both sites on hsp90 are involved in opening the steroid binding cleft. In the experiment of Fig. 4, primed GR·hsp70 complexes were incubated with the hsp70-free activating system in the presence of three hsp90 nucleotide site inhibitors, geldanamycin, novobiocin, and cisplatin. All three compounds inhibited GR activation by hsp90 in the second step reaction. The natural product inhibitors geldanamycin and radicicol bind specifically to the atypical N-terminal nucleotide-binding site on hsp90 (23Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J.

Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Geldanamycin ablates glucocorticoid binding activity in intact cells (42Whitesell L. Cook P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and prevents cell-free activation of GR to the steroid binding state by reticulocyte lysate (43Czar M.J. Galigniana M.D. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7776-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and by the purified five-protein system (12Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Silverstein A.M. Dittmar K.D. Estrada L. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6894-6900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Geldanamycin does not affect formation of a primed GR·hsp70 complex (data not shown), but it blocks receptor activation when it is present during the second step of assembly with hsp90 (Fig.5), confirming a requirement for N-terminal nucleotide binding in GR activation. Novobiocin and some related coumarins have been shown to interact with hsp90 in vitro and to cause increased turnover in vivo of hsp90 client proteins (e.g.p60v-src, Raf-1, p185erbB2), much like geldanamycin and radicicol (44Marcu M.G. Schulte T.W. Neckers L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). By deletion analysis, the novobiocin-binding site was located to a region in the C terminus of the chaperone that also binds ATP, and ATP and novobiocin competed with each other for binding (26Marcu M.G. Chadli A. Bouhouche I. Catelli M. Neckers L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37181-37186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Although it was thought that novobiocin was a specific inhibitor at the C-terminal ATP-binding site (26Marcu M.G. Chadli A. Bouhouche I. Catelli M. Neckers L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37181-37186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), Sotiet al. (27Soti C. Racz A. Csermely P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7066-7075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) have recently reported that novobiocin disrupts N-terminal nucleotide binding as well. As shown in Fig. 5, 10 mm novobiocin blocks GR activation when it is present during the second assembly step. Millimolar concentrations of novobiocin have been used to study effects on hsp90 client proteins in vivo (44Marcu M.G. Schulte T.W. Neckers L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and to study effects on hsp90 directly in vitro (27Soti C. Racz A. Csermely P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7066-7075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6A, half-maximal inhibition of GR activation is achieved with 1–2 mm novobiocin when it is present during the second step of assembly. As shown in Fig.6B, the presence of novobiocin during single-step GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly with the five-protein system, inhibited the binding of hsp70 to the GR as well as the binding of hsp90. Thus, novobiocin appears to inhibit GR activation by the multiprotein system by affecting hsp70 as well as hsp90, although hsp90 appears to be somewhat more sensitive in that its binding is blocked at a somewhat lower concentration. The antineoplastic drug cisplatin has been reported to inhibit the chaperone activity of hsp90 in vitro via an interaction with the C terminus of the chaperone (25Itoh H. Ogura M. Komatsuda A. Wakui H. Miura A.B. Tashima Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 697-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast to novobiocin, which disrupted both C- and N-terminal nucleotide binding by hsp90, Sotiet al. (27Soti C. Racz A. Csermely P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7066-7075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) found cisplatin to be a selective C-terminal nucleotide competitor. The model that has evolved from studies with cisplatin is that nucleotide binding to the N-terminal site causes a conformational change that unmasks a C-terminal binding site that is cryptic in the nucleotide-free, full-length hsp90 (27Soti C. Racz A. Csermely P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7066-7075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Selective inhibition of this C-terminal site by cisplatin might thus provide a pharmacological tool for dissecting contributions of hsp90 C-terminal nucleotide binding to opening of the steroid binding cleft in the GR. The effect of cisplatin on single step GR·hsp70 heterocomplex assembly is shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen from the immunoblot in Fig. 7A that, as the concentration of cisplatin is increased, cross-linking of GR-bound proteins occurs, as indicated by the generation of cross-linked hsp90-hsp90 dimers. At high drug concentrations, there is a marked loss of recovery of GR, hsp90 and hsp70 migrating at normalMr for these denaturing gel conditions. Not only are GR-bound hsp90 dimers being cross-linked, but the receptor itself is being cross-linked to its accompanying chaperones, as indicated by the generation of a cross-linked GR-hsp90 species. As shown in Fig.7B, there appears to be a close parallel between the concentration dependence for cisplatin inhibition of conversion of GR to the steroid binding state and generation of cross-linked hsp90 dimers bound to the receptor. Thus, although cisplatin is a specific inhibitor for the C-terminal nucleotide site on hsp90, the cross-linking that occurs during assembly by the multiprotein chaperone system does not permit any conclusion that ATP binding to the C-terminal site is involved in opening of the steroid binding cleft in the GR.

They act by stimulating the GTP hydrolysis on G protein α-subunits, which results in termination of signaling events conferred by activated G proteins. All RGS proteins share a conservative catalytic domain of ∼130 amino acid residues capable of accelerating the GTP hydrolysis on G protein α-subunits (2Burchett S.A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1335-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Many RGS proteins are also equipped with other, noncatalytic domains (3Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). There are indications that these noncatalytic domains may participate in modulation of the RGS catalytic activity or may allow RGS proteins to interact with components of other intracellular pathways (reviewed in Ref. 4Siderovski D.P. Strockbine B. Behe C.I. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 215-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Another putative role for the noncatalytic domains of RGS proteins is to contribute to the recognition of their specific G protein α-subunit targets. The idea that noncatalytic domains of RGS proteins may contribute to establishing the specificity in the RGS-G protein interactions is supported by several recent observations (5Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Harris B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31087-31093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 6He W., Lu, L.S. Zhang X., El Hodiri H.M. Chen C.K. Slep K.C. Simon M.I.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms conferring this specificity has been complicated by many reports that RGS proteins and especially their catalytic domains can stimulate the GTPase activity of a broad spectrum of G protein α-subunits in vitro. The phototransduction cascade from vertebrate photoreceptors provides a useful model for studying substrate specificity in RGS proteins. In this cascade, the complex between the short splice isoform of RGS9 (RGS9-1) and the long splice isoform of type 5 G protein β-subunit (Gβ5L) stimulates the GTPase activity of G protein, transducin (Gt). An important property of RGS9-1·Gβ5L is its selective interaction with activated Gαt bound to its effector, the γ-subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDEγ), rather than with free Gαt. The specific RGS9-1·Gβ5L interaction with the Gαt·PDEγ complex is possible, because the RGS9-1·Gβ5L affinity for Gαt·PDEγ is much higher than the affinity for free activated Gαt(8Skiba N.P. Hopp J.A.

Biol. 2001; 8: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This makes RGS9d unique among all other characterized RGS homology domains that show an opposite pattern of substrate discrimination interacting preferentially with free Gαt(10Sowa M.E., He, W.

However, the degree of discrimination between Gαt and Gαt·PDEγ observed with RGS9d is much lower than that with the full-length RGS9-1·Gβ5L (∼2-foldversus ∼20-fold; see Ref. 7Skiba N.P. Martemyanov K.A. Elfenbein A. Hopp J.A. Bohm A. Simonds W.F. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37365-37372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This suggests that both catalytic and noncatalytic domains contribute to this important property of RGS9-1·Gβ5L. The interrelation between the catalytic and noncatalytic domains conferring RGS9-1·Gβ5L specificity could be explained by two alternative hypotheses. First, the specificity may be conferred exclusively by RGS9d with noncatalytic domains enhancing the degree of the specificity of the domain. Second, catalytic and noncatalytic domains may contribute to this specificity independently of one another so that the major contributor determines the specificity of the entire RGS9-1·Gβ5L complex. The goal of this study was to test these hypotheses. Our approach was to construct an RGS9d mutant that interacted preferentially with Gαt instead of Gαt·PDEγ and then to study the effects of the same mutations introduced into the full-length RGS9-1·Gβ5L. We found that the substrate specificity of mutant RGS9-1·Gβ5L was the same as that of the wild type protein. Yet mutant RGS9-1·Gβ5L discriminated between Gαt and Gαt·PDEγ to a lower degree than did the wild type. These data indicate that noncatalytic domains of RGS9-1·Gβ5L play a decisive role in establishing its substrate specificity, but the physiologically high degree of this specificity requires contributions from both catalytic and noncatalytic domains. ROS were isolated from frozen bovine retinas (TA & WL Lawson Co., Lincoln, NE) under infrared illumination as described (13McDowell J.H. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 123-130Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Urea-treated ROS membranes lacking the activity of RGS9 were prepared using a two-step protocol (11Nekrasova E.R. Berman D.M. Rustandi R.R. Hamm H.E. Gilman A.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7638-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). First, photoreceptor discs were purified from the ROS in the dark (14Smith H.G. Stubbs G.W. Litman B.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1975; 20: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Second, the residual activity of RGS9 was inactivated by treating discs with 6 m urea for 30 min on ice (15Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16290-16296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Urea was then removed by five consecutive washes of the discs with an isotonic buffer. Rhodopsin concentration in all ROS preparations was determined spectrophotometrically from the difference in absorbance at 500 nm before and after rhodopsin bleaching, using the molar extinction coefficient of 40,000 (16Bownds D. Gordon-Walker A. Gaide-Huguenin A.-C. Robinson W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1971; 58: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Transducin was purified from bovine ROS as described (17Ting T.D. Goldin S.B. Ho Y.-K. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 180-195Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Transducin concentration used in all calculations was determined based on the maximum amount of rhodopsin-catalyzed guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding performed as described (18Fung B.B.K. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). PDEγ was prepared as described previously (19Slepak V.Z. Artemyev N.O. Zhu Y. Dumke C.L. Sabacan L. Sondek J. Hamm H.E. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14319-14324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The PDEγ-(63–87) peptide was synthesized by the solid-phase Merrifield method on an automated peptide synthesizer and purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Purity and chemical formula of the peptide were confirmed by mass spectrometry and analytical high pressure liquid chromatography. The mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 containing mouse RGS9-1 cDNA (20Makino E.R. Handy J.W., Li, T.S. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) was used as a template for PCR amplification of RGS9 cDNA. Mutations were introduced into the RGS9-1 gene using splicing by overlap extension PCR strategy (21Lefebvre B. Formstecher P. Lefebvre P. Biotechniques. 1995; 19: 186-188PubMed Google Scholar). Two overlapping DNA fragments were amplified in separate PCR reactions using either an upstream mutagenic primer TTCCTGGCCCCAGGTGCGCCGCGGTGGATC and downstream flanking primer containing a stop codon and EcoRI site or a downstream mutagenic primer CGCACCTGGGGCCAGGAACTCCTTGTAGAT and an upstream flanking primer containing a start codon and BamHI site. The resulting PCR products were purified, combined, and subjected to splicing PCR amplification in the presence of flanking primers described above. The PCR product with the size corresponding to the RGS9-1 coding region was treated with BamHI andEcoRI endonucleases and ligated with the large fragment of a modified baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392, digested with the same restriction enzymes (7Skiba N.P. Martemyanov K.A. Elfenbein A. Hopp J.A. Bohm A. Simonds W.F. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37365-37372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The integrity of the DNA sequence and incorporation of mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The resulting construct encoded recombinant RGS9-1 containing L353E and R360P mutations preceded by a His6 tag and thrombin cleavage site. The baculovirus expression construct encoding Gβ5L employed the mouse cDNAs ligated between the EcoRI andXbaI cloning sites in pVL1392. Gβ5L was modified by a M43L point mutation to block an internal translation initiation site (22Watson A.J. Aragay A.M. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28154-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These constructs were used to generate recombinant baculoviruses using a custom service provided by BD PharMingen. Positive viral clones were isolated by plaque assays followed by immunoblotting detection of the expressed RGS9-1 and Gβ5L constructs using specific antibodies (20Makino E.R. Handy J.W., Li, T.S. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Plaque-isolated recombinant viruses were amplified to obtain high titer stocks (>108 plaque-forming units per ml). RGS9-1 and its mutant were co-expressed with Gβ5L in an Sf9/baculovirus expression system and purified as described previously (7Skiba N.P. Martemyanov K.A. Elfenbein A. Hopp J.A. Bohm A. Simonds W.F. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37365-37372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Purified RGS9-1·Gβ5L and its mutant were gel-filtrated on an NAP-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Aliquots were flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C without any significant loss of their functional activity. The purity of recombinant RGS9-1·Gβ5L proteins was no less than 80%. Their concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically based on the theoretically calculated values of the extinction coefficients at 280 nm. The Escherichia coli vector pGEX2T encoding wild type RGS9d in the form of a GST-His6-RGS9d fusion protein was a generous gift from T. G. Wensel (Baylor College of Medicine). To obtain mutant RGS9d the region of full-length mutant RGS9-1 encoding the RGS homology domain (between residues 284 and 431) was amplified by PCR with an upstream primer containing an NdeI site and a downstream primer containing a stop codon and EcoRI site. The PCR product was treated with the corresponding restriction endonucleases and cloned into the pGEX2TE. coli expression vector at the BamHI andEcoRI sites via a BamHI-NdeI linker coding for the His6 tag. The resulting construct contained the coding region for RGS9d bearing the L353E and R360P mutations (mRGS9d) fused with a gene encoding GST and an in-frame linker encoding the His6 tag. Both RGS9d and mRGS9d constructs were expressed in E. coli, and the proteins were purified as described for the full-length RGS9-1·Gβ5L proteins. Transducin GTPase activity was determined by using either a multiple turnover ([GTP] > [transducin]) or single turnover ([GTP] < [transducin]) technique as described previously (8Skiba N.P. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32716-32720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The assays were conducted at room temperature (22–24 °C). Multiple turnover assays were conducted in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Single turnover assays were conducted in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The urea-treated ROS membranes, lacking endogenous activity of RGS9, were used as a source for photoexcited rhodopsin required for transducin activation in both assays. The reactions were started by the addition of 10 μl of either 0.6 μm (single turnover) or 600 μm (multiple turnover) [γ-32P]GTP (∼105disintegrations/min/sample) to 20 μl of urea-treated ROS membranes (60 μm final rhodopsin concentration for single turnover and 20 μm for multiple turnover assays) reconstituted with proteins of choice. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 6% perchloric acid. The32Pi formation was measured with activated charcoal as described (23Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 524-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All data fitting and statistical analyses were performed with SigmaPlot software, Version 6. The pull-down assays were conducted essentially as described previously (7Skiba N.P. Martemyanov K.A. Elfenbein A. Hopp J.A. Bohm A. Simonds W.F. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37365-37372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). 10 μl of Ni-NTA agarose beads were equilibrated with the binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 0.25% lauryl sucrose, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The beads were then incubated on ice for 20 min with 50 μl of 5 μmHis6-tagged RGS9-1·Gβ5L or 50 μl of 2 μm RGS9d and then washed with 500 μl of the binding buffer. The washed beads were resuspended in either 50 μl of binding buffer (for RGS9-1·Gβ5L) or in 500 μl of binding buffer (for RGS9d) containing 1 μg of transducin. 10 mm NaF and 30 μm AlCl3 (yielding AlF4−) and/or PDEγ (1 μmfinal) were added when necessary. The full-length PDEγ rather than the PDEγ-(63–87) peptide was used in this assay to allow better transducin·PDEγ complex retention upon washing the agarose beads because of a higher affinity of Gαt for PDEγ than for PDEγ-(63–87). The samples were incubated on ice for 20 min with occasional shaking. The beads were spun down and washed twice with 1 ml of the binding buffer supplemented with 20 mm imidazole. 10 mm NaF and 30 μm AlCl3 were present when required. Bound Gαt was eluted from the beads with 40 μl SDS-PAGE sample buffer. 10-μl aliquots of the eluates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gαt was detected using anti-Gαt1 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Crucial for the design of an RGS9d mutant that would interact preferentially with free activated Gαt instead of Gαt·PDEγ were the findings by Sowa et al. (10Sowa M.E., He, W. Slep K.C. Kercher M.A. Lichtarge O. Wensel T.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) that identified the amino acid residues responsible for substrate specificity of RGS7d (a catalytic domain of RGS7 related closely to RGS9). They have shown that normally RGS7d activates the GTPase of free Gαt better than that of the Gαt·PDEγ complex, but substituting only two residues within RGS7d for corresponding residues from RGS9d reverses the effect of PDEγ, from inhibition of the RGS7d activity to its stimulation. Following the same logic, we introduced reciprocal amino acid substitutions (L353E and R360P) into RGS9d with the expectation that this would also reverse the substrate specificity of RGS9d. Both mutant proteins were expressed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and their substrate specificities were studied by a combination of GTPase activity measurements and pull-down assays. We first studied the effects of the L353E/R360P double mutation on the catalytic properties of RGS9d. The abilities of wild type RGS9d and mRGS9d to stimulate transducin GTPase in the presence and absence of PDEγ were analyzed under single turnover conditions (Fig. 1). In this method, transducin is allowed to perform a single synchronized turnover of GTP hydrolysis, the rate of which can be determined from the exponential analysis of its time course. In agreement with our prediction, PDEγ stimulated the activity of RGS9d but inhibited the activity of mRGS9d. The inhibition of mRGS9d by PDEγ was so strong that no reliable difference in the rates of GTP hydrolysis were detected in the assays conducted with transducin alone and transducin supplemented with 0.5 μm mRGS9d and excess PDEγ-(63–87). We then analyzed the dependence of transducin GTPase rate on mRGS9d concentration (Fig. 2) and found that the inhibitory effect of PDEγ-(63–87) was the strongest at low mRGS9d concentrations and gradually disappeared as the concentration of mRGS9d increased. This observation is consistent with the idea that the affinity of mRGS9d for Gαt is higher than for Gαt·PDEγ so that the maximal difference in the GTPase rates is observed at the lowest tested concentrations of participating proteins. Similarly, the stimulatory effect of PDEγ on the activity of wild type RGS9d diminished with increasing RGS9d concentration (see Fig. 2C from Ref. 7Skiba N.P. Martemyanov K.A. Elfenbein A. Hopp J.A. Bohm A. Simonds W.F. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37365-37372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). An independent evidence that the L353E/R360P mutation acts by modulating the affinities of RGS9d to its substrates, Gαtand Gαt·PDEγ, was obtained in the pull-down assays with RGS9d or mRGS9d immobilized on Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Fig.3). As we reported previously (7Skiba N.P. Martemyanov K.A. Elfenbein A. Hopp J.A. Bohm A. Simonds W.F. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37365-37372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), PDEγ caused a small but reliable increase in the ability of Gαt activated by AlF4− to bind to immobilized RGS9d. The binding of activated Gαt to mRGS9d was much more efficient than its binding to RGS9d. However, in contrast to RGS9d, PDEγ reduced this binding significantly. We next compared the abilities of RGS9d and mRGS9d to activate transducin GTPase in the multiple turnover assays. In this method, transducin GTPase is measured in the presence of a small catalytic amount of RGS protein and varying amounts of transducin at the saturating concentration of GTP. The Michaelis analysis of the data, assuming RGS as the enzyme and Gαt as the substrate, yields the maximal rate of RGS protein turnover and the value of its apparent Michaelis constant for transducin. The experiment shown in Fig. 4 indicated that theVmax value for mRGS9d was ∼3-fold higher than that for RGS9d, and the Km value for mRGS9d was ∼1.6-fold lower than the value for RGS9d. Thus, mRGS9d not only binds to activated Gαt with higher affinity than does RGS9d (as also evident from Fig. 3), but it also stimulates its GTPase activity more efficiently. Note that we did not attempt to analyze the effects of PDEγ on the mRGS9d activity in the multiple turnover assays, because PDEγ causes a strong inhibition of transducin release from RGS9d after the completion of GTP hydrolysis making the Michaelis analysis inapplicable (7Skiba N.P. Martemyanov K.A. Elfenbein A. Hopp J.A. Bohm A. Simonds W.F. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37365-37372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The same inhibitory effect was observed with mRGS9d; data not shown. In summary, our data indicate that the L353E/R360P mutations in RGS9d reversed its substrate specificity. Unlike RGS9d, mRGS9d interacts more efficiently with Gαt than with the Gαt·PDEγ complex. An additional effect of the mutations was that the catalytic activity of mRGS9d was increased, as well. In the next series of experiments we introduced the L353E/R360P mutations into the full-length RGS9-1·Gβ5L and studied how they affect the substrate specificity of the entire complex. We used the same combination of kinetic and pull-down assays as in the experiments with mRGS9d. Single turnover measurements of transducin GTPase activity revealed that PDEγ potentiated the ability of mutant RGS9-1·Gβ5L to activate transducin GTPase (Fig 5). This is in striking contrast to the inhibitory effect of PDEγ on the activity of mRGS9d (Fig. 1). Moreover, PDEγ stimulated the activity of mutant and wild type RGS9-1·Gβ5L to the same absolute level. Yet the basal activity of the mutant observed in the absence of PDEγ was higher than the basal activity of the wild type. We next compared the catalytic parameters of wild type and mutant RGS9-1·Gβ5L in multiple turnover GTPase assays. As discussed in our previous studies (7Skiba N.P. Martemyanov K.A. Elfenbein A. Hopp J.A. Bohm A. Simonds W.F. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37365-37372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 8Skiba N.P. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32716-32720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), this approach allows an application of Michaelis analysis to studying RGS9-1·Gβ5L activity with and without PDEγ. The experiment shown in Fig.6 demonstrates that in the presence of PDEγ the wild type and mutant RGS9-1·Gβ5L have very similar catalytic properties yielding practically identicalVmax and Km values. This is entirely consistent with the results of the single turnover assays. TheKm value for the mutant in the absence of PDEγ was ∼3-fold lower than the Km for the wild type RGS9-1·Gβ5L, consistent with a smaller effect of PDEγ observed in single turnover GTPase measurements. The Vmaxvalues measured for both proteins without PDEγ were somewhat different, but this difference was much smaller than that between theKm values. The difference in the Km values observed in the absence of PDEγ in Fig. 6 suggests that mutant RGS9-1·Gβ5L has a higher affinity for Gαt than the wild type protein. This was confirmed independently in the pull-down assays illustrated in Fig.7. In striking contrast to the data obtained with mRGS9d (Fig. 3), PDEγ increased the amount of Gαt retained on the beads with both wild type and mutant RGS9-1·Gβ5L. The retention of Gαt·PDEγ by the mutant and wild type RGS9-1·Gβ5L was practically the same, whereas the retention of free Gαt by the mutant was more significant than by the wild type RGS9-1·Gβ5L. This is also consistent with the Michaelis analysis of Fig. 6. RGS proteins regulate signal duration in a large array of G protein pathways. Each G protein signal has to be terminated at a physiologically appropriate time, which may vary in different cell types and individual pathways. The abundance of both RGS and G proteins raises the issue of specificity in their mutual recognition. Many studies attempted to establish the patterns of this specificity in vitro by analyzing the ability of individual RGS proteins to form complexes with various Gα-subunits or to stimulate their GTPase activity (reviewed in Refs. 3Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar and 24Cowan C.W., He, W. Wensel T.G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 65: 341-359Crossref Google Scholar). In these studies, specificity was defined as the ability of RGS to form the tightest complex with a given G protein α-subunit and/or to stimulate its GTP hydrolysis to the highest extent. For example, RGS2 was found to bind selectively to Gq but not to Go (25Heximer S.P. Watson N. Linder M.E. Blumer K.J. Hepler J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14389-14393Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), whereas RGS7 and RGS6 complexes with Gβ5 were shown to stimulate the GTP hydrolysis of Go much better than that of many other G protein α-subunits (see Ref. 5Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Harris B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31087-31093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar for additional examples). In contrast, some RGS proteins, like RGS4, seem to be rather nonspecific in interacting with their Gα partners (5Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Harris B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31087-31093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 26Lan K.L. Zhong H.L. Nanamori M. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33497-33503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The studies of G protein signaling in vertebrate phototransduction revealed significant limitations of this straightforward approach to defining RGS-G protein interaction specificity. In this cascade, RGS9-1·Gβ5L has to rapidly inactivate Gαt after it stimulates the activity of the effector, PDE. However, to deliver the signal to the effector with maximal efficiency, Gαtshould not be inactivated by RGS9-1·Gβ5L before it interacts with PDE (27Arshavsky V.Y. Pugh E.N., Jr. Neuron. 1998; 20: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 28Tsang S.H. Burns M.E. Calvert P.D. Gouras P. Baylor D.A. Goff S.P. Arshavsky V.Y.

This is achieved by the intrinsic ability of RGS9-1·Gβ5L to discriminate between free activated Gαt and Gαt complexed with PDEγ. Thus the specificity of RGS9-1·Gβ5L in this pathway can be defined as its ability to discriminate between the two states of Gαtrather than its ability to select among different G protein α-subunits. Furthermore, an assessment of RGS9-1·Gβ5L specificity without considering the contribution from PDEγ is unlikely to reveal transducin as its specific partner (compare, for example, Fig. 7,lanes 2 and 3). Such clear understanding of the physiological function of the RGS9-1·Gβ5L makes this RGS protein a good model for studying how the specificity of its action is determined by the molecular organization of its structural domains. Specific recognition of the Gαt·PDE complex by RGS9-1·Gβ5L is achieved by a large difference between the RGS9-1·Gβ5L affinities for free activated Gαt and for Gαt·PDEγ. Both RGS9-1·Gβ5L and RGS9d display this difference in affinities, but RGS9-1·Gβ5L discriminates between its two substrates to a much higher degree than RGS9d (6He W., Lu, L.S.

In our previous study (7Skiba N.P. Martemyanov K.A. Elfenbein A. Hopp J.A. Bohm A. Simonds W.F. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37365-37372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we showed that noncatalytic domains act by making two opposite contributions to the affinities of RGS9-1·Gβ5L for Gαt and Gαt·PDEγ. The seven-bladed β-propeller core of Gβ5 associated with the G protein α subunit-like (GGL) domain of RGS9 reduces the affinity between RGS9 and Gαt, regardless of whether Gαt is free or is complexed with PDEγ. Three other domains, including disheveled/EGL-10/pleckstrin homology (DEP), the C terminus of RGS9, and the N terminus of Gβ5L, increase the RGS9 affinity for Gαt·PDEγ but not for free Gαt, thus counteracting the affinity reduction (or inhibition) imposed by GGL·Gβ5. The overall effect of these two affinity shifts of opposite direction is manifested in the ∼20-fold difference in the RGS9·Gβ5L affinities for free Gαtand Gαt·PDEγ. Thus, noncatalytic domains provide a major contribution to the overall specificity of RGS9-1·Gβ5L. What remained to be determined is whether noncatalytic domains act by enhancing the intrinsic specificity of the catalytic domain or whether they contribute to the overall RGS9-1·Gβ5L specificity independently. The primary role of RGS catalytic domains in activating G protein GTPase may argue for the former alternative. This argument is consistent with the observations that RGS9d is capable to interact preferentially with the Gαt·PDEγ complex whereas all other tested RGS proteins and their catalytic domains interact preferentially with free activated Gαt. Yet the experiments reported in this study indicate that the latter alternative is correct. We found that introduction of two point mutations, L353E and R360P, reversed the substrate specificity of RGS9d so that it interacted preferentially with free activated Gαt rather than Gαt·PDEγ. However, an introduction of the same mutations into the entire RGS9-1·Gβ5L complex did not reverse its specificity. Recent studies with RGS7·Gβ5, a protein complex sharing the overall domain organization with RGS9-1·Gβ5L, demonstrated that noncatalytic domains are likely to determine its specificity, as well. It has been shown that the catalytic domain of RGS7 stimulates the GTPase activities of Gαi and Gαo with equal efficiencies (26Lan K.L. Zhong H.L. Nanamori M. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33497-33503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 30Rose J.J. Taylor J.B. Shi J. Cockett M.I. Jones P.G. Hepler J.R. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2103-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) whereas the full-length RGS7·Gβ5 complex stimulates the GTPase activity of only Gαo (5Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Harris B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31087-31093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 30Rose J.J. Taylor J.B. Shi J. Cockett M.I. Jones P.G. Hepler J.R. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2103-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, the primary role of the noncatalytic domains of RGS9-1·Gβ5L in determining its substrate specificity is likely to reflect a general principle in RGS protein functioning. Although mutations in the catalytic domain did not affect the overall substrate specificity of RGS9-1·Gβ5L, the degree of substrate discrimination by the mutant RGS9-1·Gβ5L was reduced. Although both wild type and mutant RGS9-1·Gβ5L interacted with Gαt·PDEγ with the same affinity, the affinity of the mutant for free Gαtwas higher than that of the wild type (see Figs. 6 and 7). Specifically, the Km value for stimulating transducin GTPase by mutant RGS9-1·Gβ5L with PDEγ present was ∼6-fold lower than the value observed without PDEγ. A significantly larger ∼23-fold difference in the corresponding Kmvalues was observed for the wild type RGS9-1·Gβ5L. Thus, noncatalytic domains are sufficient to ensure specific recognition of Gαt by RGS9-1·Gβ5L, but the physiologically high degree of substrate discrimination requires an additional contribution from the catalytic domain. Interestingly, this contribution from the catalytic domain appears to reside in its relatively low ability to interact with free Gαt. Indeed, the L353E/R360P mutations “improved” the catalytic properties of RGS9d by both increasing its affinity for Gαt and providing for a higher catalytic activity (see Figs. 3 and 4). However, these improvements were not beneficial for establishing the physiologically relevant substrate specificity of RGS9-1·Gβ5L. Another important aspect of the mutagenesis conducted in this study is that it re-emphasizes the crucial role of the α5-α6 helices in the core of RGS catalytic domain in conferring its substrate specificity. McEntaffer et al. (12McEntaffer R.L. Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4931-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) found that the replacement of a larger region, between the α3 and α5 helices, in RGS16 with a corresponding region from RGS9 reversed the inhibition of RGS16 by PDEγ for moderate stimulation. They also showed that a reciprocal replacement within RGS9d reversed its PDEγ stimulation for inhibition. More recently, Sowa et al. (10Sowa M.E., He, W. Slep K.C. Kercher M.A. Lichtarge O. Wensel T.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) identified several amino acid residues in RGS7, located at the end of α5 helix and in the loop connecting α5 and α6 helixes of the catalytic domain, that regulate directly the ability of RGS7d to stimulate transducin GTPase and to cooperate positively with PDEγ. These and our findings are consistent with the data from the crystal structure of the triple complex of RGS9d, Gαt/i chimeric protein, and PDEγ-(46–87) peptide (31Slep K.C. Kercher M.A., He, W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Sigler P.B. Nature. 2001; 409: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In this structure, Leu-353 is located at the end of the α5 helix of RGS9d, and Arg-360 is located in the loop connecting α5 and α6 helices. This entire region interacts with both switch II of Gαt and PDEγ consistent with observations that mutations in this region result in significant changes in their interactions. In summary, our results support the idea that a high degree of substrate specificity of a multi-domain RGS protein can be achieved though synergistic contributions from all of its constituting domains.

The stable cellular association of the released fluorophor, which prevents a high background fluorescence, is essential for sensitive detection of cellular enzymatic activity. Rhodamine 110 is a highly fluorescent xanthene dye with an excitation wavelength at 494 nm and a quantum yield of 0.91, reflecting the quotient of emitted and absorbed photons (24Leytus S.P. Melhado L.L. Mangel W.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It possesses two amino groups suitable for the coupling of protease substrates, which results in a colorless nonfluorescent compound. Hydrolysis of these substrate structures releases the highly fluorescent rhodamine 110 (24Leytus S.P. Melhado L.L. Mangel W.F. Biochem.

In these studies, a stable cellular fluorescence was considered because of the intracellular hydrolysis of the substrates and the accumulation of the fluorescent cleaving products within the cells. Our previous data described rhodamine compounds of the types (Xaa-Pro)2-R110 and Xaa-Pro-R110 as sensitive substrates of isolated and cell surface-associated DP IV (31Lorey S. Faust J. Hermanns U. Bu¨hling F. Ansorge S. Neubert K. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 421: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Here we describe novel fluorogenic DP IV substrates Xaa-Pro-R110-R, which represents bifunctional compounds containing the substrate structure Gly(Ala)-Pro and thiol and amino group reactive anchor R for the covalent fixation of R110 on the cell surface. These substrates provide the opportunity to determine cell surface-associated DP IV activity on single cells. Moreover, by studying these membrane-fixed substrates, it was possible to demonstrate that the ectoenzyme DP IV could be involved in transcellular proteolysis.

Dichloromaleic acid anhydride (2.11 g; 1 mmol) and 6-aminocaproic acid (1.31 g; 1 mmol) were dissolved in dry tetrahydrofurane and refluxed for 3 h. The solvent was removed, and the solid was dissolved in CHCl3and filtered. The filtrate was then evaporated. The residue was recrystallized from diethyl ether/PEth to give 1.81 g (86%) of 6-(2,3-dichloromaleimidyl)caproic acid (melting point 95.5–96 °C; electrospray mass spectrometry, 279; [M+H]+, calculated 279.0).

The solvent was evaporated, the residue was resolved in 10 ml of toluol, and the solvent was evaporated again. This procedure was repeated three times, and then 120.6 mg (96.3%) of the product Boc-Gly-Pro-R110-R1 was precipitated by the addition of diethyl ether. The Boc protecting group of the compounds Boc-Gly-Pro-R110-R (R = R2–R8) was removed by dissolving 0.1 mmol of Boc-Gly-Pro-R110-R in 1.8 ml of CH2Cl2 and 200 μl of trifluoroacetic acid. The solution was left for 3 h at room temperature. The product Gly-Pro-R110-R was precipitated by the addition of cold diethyl ether before being filtered and dried in a vacuum. Boc-Gly-Pro-R110-R1 and Boc-Ala-Pro-R110-R9 were deprotected by dissolving 0.1 mmol in 1 ml of HCl/acetic acid (1 m HCl). The solution was left for 30 min at room temperature, and the product was precipitated as described above. R110-R6 was synthesized using the carbodiimide method as described above.

Gly-Pro-R110-R compounds where R = R1, R2, R3, and R6 were purified by reversed-phase HPLC.

Open table in a new tab DP IV with a specific activity of 51.9 units/mg (measured with Gly-Pro-pNA) at a protein concentration of 2.25 mg/ml was used. All of the enzyme assays were incubated at 30 °C in 0.04m Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.6, I = 0.125m with KCl). The cleavage of substrates catalyzed by DP IV (pig kidney) was measured at enzyme concentrations of 6.85 × 10−10 and 1.37 × 10−9m. The hydrolysis product R110-R was monitored at 494 nm and substrate concentrations between 10−6 and 4 × 10−4m over 120 s, with at least two independent measurements. The kinetic parameters were evaluated using the software Microcal Origin 4.10 and specified by standard deviation. The molar absorption coefficients of R110-R were established via enzymatic hydrolysis and acid hydrolysis. Substrate solutions (5 × 10−6, 10−5, and 2 × 10−5m) were incubated with DP IV (10−8m) for 5 h at 30 °C. After completion of hydrolysis, the absorption was measured spectrophotometrically at 494 nm. For acid hydrolysis, the substrate solution was incubated in 6 m HCl for 8 h at room temperature. The solution was then neutralized with 6m NaOH and diluted with Tris/HCl buffer. The absorption was measured spectrophotometrically at 494 nm. U937 cells (33Sundstrom C. Nilsson K. Int. J. Cancer. 1976; 17: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (w/v) fetal calf serum, 10−3m glutamine, and antibiotics. CHO wild-type cells were cultured in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium supplemented with 10% (w/v) fetal calf serum, and CD26-transfected CHO cells (34Hong W.J Piazza G.A. Hixson D.C. Doyle D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8474-8479Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) were cultured in Glasgow minimal essential medium with supplements (10% fetal calf serum (w/v), antibiotics, sodium bicarbonate (29.3 mm), 1% nonessential amino acids (v/v, 100×), 372.2 mm glutamine, 364.7 mmasparagine, 0.91 mm sodium pyruvate, 23.9 mmadenosine, 22.6 mm guanosine, 26.3 mm cytidine, 26.2 mm uridine, and 9.0 mm thymidine). All of the cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% (v/v) CO2. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from heparinized blood (10 units/ml blood) of healthy donors using density gradient centrifugation with Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia Corp.) for 30 min at 500 × g. The cells were incubated and washed with PBS (pH 7.2), and all of the centrifugation steps were performed at room temperature. The cell suspension (100 μl, 2 × 105 U937 cells) was mixed with 100 μl of substrate solution (3.3 × 10−3mGly-Pro-pNA in PBS). Part of this mixture (100 μl) was removed immediately, and the enzymatic reaction was stopped by the addition of 400 μl of acetate buffer (1 m, pH 4.4). The remaining 100 μl were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The reaction was then stopped as described above. After centrifugation (2 min at 10,000 × g) the absorbance of the supernatant was measured spectrophotometrically at 390 nm. For measurements of substrate hydrolysis by cell-associated DP IV, 96-well plates were used. Substrates Xaa-Pro-R110-R (50 μl, five concentrations between 10−6 and 10−5m) were incubated with 50 μl of a suspension of U937 cells (DP IV activity determined using Gly-Pro- pNA = 25 pkat/ml) at 37 °C. Fluorescence was measured immediately and after 30 min (excitation, 490 nm; emission, 520 nm) using a fluorescence plate reader Fluorolite 1000 (Dynatech Laboratories). The specificity of the substrate hydrolysis was determined using specific DP IV inhibitors Lys[Z(NO2)]thiazolidide, Lys[Z(NO2)]piperidide, and Lys[Z(NO2)]pyrrolidide (34Hong W.J Piazza G.A. Hixson D.C. Doyle D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8474-8479Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The U937 cells (50 μl, 105 cells) were incubated with the substrates (10−5m) and the inhibitors (10−6–10−4m). U937 cells (200 μl, 2 × 105 cells) were incubated with substrates Xaa-Pro-R110-R (5 × 10−6m) for 30 min at 37 °C and washed as described above. The cellular fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry (FACS Calibur, Beckton Dickinson), and 104 cells were registered for each sample. Wild-type CHO cells were incubated for 20 min with the substrate Xaa-Pro-R110-R (5 × 10−5m) at 4 °C. The cells were then washed, resuspended in 100 μl of PBS, and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 100 μl of isolated DP IV (100 pkat/ml) or CD26-overexpressing CHO cells (100 pkat/ml). As a control the cells were incubated in presence of the DP IV-specific inhibitor Lys[Z(NO2)]thiazolidide (10−4m). The cellular fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. Wild-type CHO cells incubated in PBS as well as incubated in the presence of the inhibitor and the substrate were used as controls. Wild-type CHO cells and CD26-overexpressing CHO cells as well as a mixture of both cell types were incubated for 20 min with the substrate Xaa-Pro-R110-R (5 × 10−6m) at 4 °C. Simultaneously, the cells were incubated with a PE-labeled anti-CD26 antibody. The cells were washed, resuspended in 200 μl of PBS, and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Alternatively, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stained using the substrates Xaa-Pro-R110-R and antiCD26 antibody. The cellular fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. The cells incubated with substrate only, PE-labeled anti-CD26 antibody, and PE-labeled IgG were used as controls. CD26-transfected CHO cells and wild-type CHO cells were grown in 8-well chambers and stained with anti-CD26 and TR-labeled secondary antibodies. After antibody staining, the cells were incubated with Gly-Pro-R110-R6 or Ala-Pro-R110-R9 (5 × 10−6m) in the presence of Lys[Z(NO2)]thiazolidide (10−4m) for 30 min at room temperature, then washed, and incubated for a further 30 min. The cellular fluorescence was observed using a conventional microscope (Axiovert 135 TV, Zeiss, Jena, Germany). We synthesized novel DP IV anchor substrates Xaa-Pro-R110-R with Xaa being Gly or Ala and R being a reactive anchor group of varying length, hydrophobicity, and reactivity (Fig.1). The compounds were colorless and nonfluorescent. The DP IV-catalyzed substrate hydrolysis resulted in the release of the highly fluorescent R110-R, which was measured at absorption maxima of 467 and 494 nm and by an emission maximum of 525 nm. The hydrolysis products R110-R were neither substrates nor inhibitors of DP IV. The molar absorption coefficients were found to be almost 30,000 m−1 cm−1 (R110-R (m−1·cm−1); R1, ε494 = 25,495; R2, ε494 = 30,687; R3, ε494 = 30,263; R4, ε494 = 29,653; R5, ε494 = 28,256; R7, ε494 = 30,237; R8: ε494 = 29,204, acid hydrolysis; R9, ε494 = 32,173, acid hydrolysis). R110-R6showed a decreased molar absorption coefficient (ε494 = 9686 m−1·cm−1) caused by the aromatic moiety. All compounds Xaa-Pro-R110-R were hydrolyzed by isolated DP IV from pig kidney; thekcat/Km values were between 1.14 × 106 (Gly-Pro-R110-R2) and 3.33 × 106 (Gly-Pro-R110-R6)m−1·s−1 (TableII). The compounds were hydrolyzed by the model of substrate inhibition in a nonhyperbolic dependence of initial velocity on substrate concentration. A longer and more hydrophobic R resulted in a decrease in the Km value.Table IIKinetic constants of the DP IV-catalyzed hydrolysis of Xaa-Pro-R110-RCompound105Kmkcat10−6kcat/Km104Kims−1m−1·s−1mGly-Pro-R110-R R = R117.40 ± 6.24235.60 ± 43.251.35 ± 0.562.95 ± 1.04 R = R26.23 ± 0.6170.84 ± 4.211.14 ± 0.132.30 ± 0.25 R = R33.77 ± 0.4067.49 ± 3.461.79 ± 0.216.05 ± 0.90 R = R43.83 ± 0.3159.65 ± 2.551.56 ± 0.142.24 ± 0.19 R = R51.54 ± 0.1742.39 ± 1.782.75 ± 0.337.87 ± 1.58 R = R61.10 ± 0.2036.64 ± 3.743.33 ± 0.691.02 ± 0.27 R = R72.67 ± 0.2160.12 ± 2.082.25 ± 0.196.32 ± 0.77 R = R81.25 ± 0.1040.41 ± 1.233.23 ± 0.283.69 ± 0.39Ala-Pro-R110-R R = R90.58 ± 0.0714.67 ± 0.922.55 ± 0.440.80 ± 0.13The measurements were performed in 40 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.6, I = 0.125) at 30 °C over 120 s. The cleavage of the substrates (between 10−6 and 4 × 10−4) was monitored by measuring the absorption of the released R110-R at 494 nm. In the assay, DP IV (pig kidney) was set between 6.85 × 10−10 and 1.37 × 10−9m. Open table in a new tab The measurements were performed in 40 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.6, I = 0.125) at 30 °C over 120 s.

In the assay, DP IV (pig kidney) was set between 6.85 × 10−10 and 1.37 × 10−9m. All compounds Xaa-Pro-R110-R were hydrolyzed after incubation with DP IV-rich U937 cells. The cleavage of the substrates Gly-Pro-R110-R depended on the steric requirements of the anchor group R. A large or a short R residue resulted in decreased fluorescence after cleavage of the substrates by cell-associated DP IV (Fig.2). Using the specific DP IV inhibitors Lys[Z(NO2)]thiazolidide, Lys[Z(NO2)]pyrrolidide, and Lys[Z(NO2)]piperidide (35Born I. Faust J. Heins J. Barth A. Neubert K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 63 (Suppl. 40): 23Google Scholar) there was almost full inhibition of substrate hydrolysis at inhibitor concentrations of 10−5m (not shown). The suitability of the anchor group R for the stable fixation of the substrates Xaa-Pro-R110-R or the hydrolysis products R110-R on cells was examined. U937 cells were incubated with substrates Xaa-Pro-R110-R (5 × 10−6m), and the cell-associated fluorescence of the hydrolysis product R110 was measured directly and after one to four washing steps. The stability of the cell-associated fluorescence was classified according to the R residue (Table III). After hydrolysis of Gly-Pro-R110-R1 (R1 = acetyl group) and four washings, only 3% of the initially detected cleavage product remained surface-associated. On the other hand, after hydrolysis of Gly-Pro-R110-R2 (R2 = chloroacetyl anchor) and four washings, 92.5% of the initial fluorescences signal was detected on the cells. The substrates with the chloromethylbenzoyl anchor (R6) and N-carboxyalkyl-maleinimide anchors (R7, R8, and R9) were less reactive (cell-associated fluorescence was between 70 and 80%). Aliphatic halogenalkylcarbonyl residues R (R3, R4, and R5) were the most ineffective anchors with cell-associated fluorescence between 10 and 30%. Generally, the insertion of a reactive group on the R110 molecule resulted in stable fixation of the fluorophore on cells.Table IIICellular fluorescence after incubation with substrates Xaa-Pro-R110-RCompoundCell-associated fluorescence relative to the cumulative fluorescence intensityWash step 1Wash step 2Wash step 3Wash step 4%Gly-Pro-R110-R R = R110.40 ± 5.406.84 ± 3.404.62 ± 2.672.73 ± 1.28 R = R293.84 ± 4.4394.82 ± 1.2493.50 ± 0.9192.50 ± 0.78 R = R336.18 ± 7.3429.65 ± 9.0429.65 ± 9.0425.72 ± 7.48 R = R424.77 ± 5.4414.07 ± 5.3811.91 ± 4.269.91 ± 3.91 R = R542.77 ± 0.8236.94 ± 5.0235.36 ± 5.8732.90 ± 7.02 R = R675.23 ± 2.5871.81 ± 3.2971.50 ± 3.9371.03 ± 5.14 R = R789.56 ± 8.7378.09 ± 9.3971.04 ± 8.2871.04 ± 8.28 R = R888.46 ± 6.2680.36 ± 9.5174.78 ± 8.8172.42 ± 9.40Ala-Pro-R110-R R = R993.59 ± 5.4685.31 ± 9.8380.26 ± 9.6377.39 ± 9.57106 U937 cells/ml were incubated in PBS (pH 7.2) with substrates Xaa-Pro-R110-R (5 × 10−6m) at 37 °C.

https://openalex.org/W2060688319,"Numerous studies have shown that the retroviral oncogene v-myb encodes a transcription factor (v-Myb) which interferes with the differentiation program of myelomonocytic cells. It is generally thought that v-Myb deregulates the expression of specific target genes and thereby causes transformation of these cells. By using an estrogen-inducible version of v-Myb we have previously identified the gene for the chicken A2B adenosine receptor (A2B-AR), a member of the seven-pass transmembrane receptor superfamily, as a bona fide target gene for v-Myb. The chicken A2B-AR gene is expressed in v-myb transformed myeloblasts as well as in c-myb expressing erythroblasts, offering the opportunity to study how Myb transcription factors activate a target gene in two different hematopoietic lineages. Here, we report the characterization of the promoter of the A2B-AR gene. We show that the A2B-AR promoter region contains an exceptionally large number of Myb binding sites, many of which contribute to the Myb-inducibility of the promoter. The same sites were required for promoter activity in myelomonocytic and erythroid cells. In contrast to the promoters of other Myb target genes the A2B-AR promoter was not activated synergistically by Myb and other lineage-specific transcription factors that have been identified as Myb cooperation partners before. Taken together, our data suggest that the activation of the A2B-AR promoter by Myb depends on the simultaneous binding of a large number of Myb molecules."

In the current study, domains within the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) reactive at the plasma membrane were identified using a novel yeast one-hybrid screen. The cytosolic N terminus of αENaC and the cytosolic C termini of α-, β-, and γENaC contained domains reactive at the plasma membrane. Fluorescent micrographs of epithelial cells overexpressing fusion proteins of enhanced green fluorescent protein and mENaC cytosolic domains were consistent with those in yeast. A novel membrane reactive domain within the cytosolic C terminus of γ-mENaC was localized to the 17 amino acids between residues Thr584–Pro600. Two overlapping internalization signals within the C terminus of γ-mENaC, a WW-binding domain (PY motif) and a tyrosine-based endocytic signal, were additive with respect to decreasing complementation and expression levels of hybrid proteins. Decreases in expression levels of hybrid proteins containing the PY and endocytic motif were reversed with latrunculin A, an inhibitor of endosomal movement. Decreases in complementation and expression levels of hybrid proteins mediated by the combined PY and overlapping endocytic motif proceeded in the absence of established ubiquitination sites within ENaC. In addition, the endocytic motif was active in the absence of the PY motif, demonstrating that these two domains, while possibly interacting, also have discrete functions. The novel domains within the cytosolic N terminus of αENaC and the C termini of α-, β-, and γENaC identified here are likely to be involved in protein-protein and/or protein-lipid interactions localized to the plasma membrane.

Control of ENaC activity involves both direct post-translation modifications of the channel as well as protein-protein interactions involving the cytoplasmic tails (reviewed in Ref. 24Rotin D. Kanelis V. Schild L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F391-F399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the central role of ENaC in fluid homeostasis is well established, less is known about the structure-function relation of this ion channel and the domains critical to protein-protein interactions involved in channel modulation. The C-terminal cytosolic domains of all three ENaC subunits contain two well conserved proline-rich sequences (P1 and P2) as follows: a minimal consensus SH3-binding domain (P1; PXXP) and a PY motif (P2; PPPXY) that interacts with WW domains in ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase, such as Nedd4 (25McDonald F.J.

Interestingly, P1 in α- but not β- or γENaC interacts with α-spectrin localizing this subunit to the luminal plasma membrane of polarized epithelia (27Rotin D. Bar-Sagi D. O'Brodovich H.

The salt-sensitive hypertension associated with inheritable Liddle’s syndrome in humans results from deletion/disruption of the PY domains in β- and γENaC. Such mutations abrogate Nedd4 binding. This then leads to inappropriate overexpression of active ENaC at the apical membrane because of decreases in normal channel retrieval and degradation in the proteosomal compartment (28Staub O.

The C-terminal cytosolic regions of β- and γENaC, in addition, contain well conserved clathrin-coated pit-mediated endocytosis tags (YXXΦ, where Φ is a hydrophobic amino acid) that partially overlap the PY motif (32Shimkets R.A.

The latter portions of the cytosolic C termini of ENaC are also believed to bind actin and interact with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl− channel both of which then affect ENaC activity (39Copeland S.J.

Comparatively less is known about functional domains within the N-terminal cytosolic regions of ENaC subunits. The target for ubiquitination mediated by Nedd4 binding to C-terminal PY motifs is located in the N terminus of both α- and γENaC (41Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). In addition, a 10-amino acid tract (Thr92–Cys101) containing a critical glycine (Gly95) in the N-terminal cytosolic region of αENaC has been shown to be important to proper channel gating and is mutated in some forms of the inheritable hypotensive salt-wasting disease pseudohypoaldosteronism type I, which results from loss of function mutations in ENaC (42Grunder S. Jaeger N.F. Gautschi I. Schild L. Rossier B.C. Pfluegers Arch. 1999; 438: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It also has been shown that residues 2–67 in α-rENaC contain a retrieval tag, and that a distinct domain within the N-terminal tail of this ENaC subunit is required for channel activity (43Chalfant M.L.

Gupta and Canessa (44Gupta S.S. Canessa C.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) have demonstrated previously that heterologous expression of ENaC in Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in functional channels. In the present work, we sought to further use this simple system to identify novel domains within the cytosolic regions of ENaC subunits that are reactive at the plasma membrane and to investigate further the role of C-terminal domains involved in channel internalization and ultimately degradation. Such domains are likely involved in protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions important for channel modulation, localization, and recycling.

A6 cells were maintained in culture using standard procedures described previously (48Stockand J.D. Spier B.J. Worrell R.T. Yue G., Al- Baldawi N. Eaton D.C. J. Biol.

For fluorescence microscopy, A6 cells were seeded on number 0 Micro cover glass (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and transfected after becoming 50–80% confluent (see below). Transfected cells were used for study up to 2 days after transfection. The mCT1 cell line was maintained in culture using standard techniques described previously (45Takacs-Jarrett M. Sweeney W.E.

In brief, cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 33 °C and 5% CO2 in 1:1 DMEM/Ham’s F-12 supplemented with 1.3 μg/liter sodium selenite, 1.3 μg/liter triiodothyronine, 5 mg/liter insulin, 5 mg/liter transferrin, 25 μg/liter prostaglandin E1, 2.5 mm glucose, 5 μm dexamethasone, 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 units/ml γ-interferon, and antibiotics. For fluorescence microscopy, mCT1 cells were treated in a similar manner as A6 cells with the exception that plasmid DNA was introduced with a distinct transfection protocol (see below). Chinese hamster ovary cells were maintained in culture using standard techniques. For fluorescence microscopy, CHO cells were treated identically to mCT1. Yeast cells were maintained in culture using standard techniques described previously (46Petitjean A. Hilger F. Tatchell K. Genetics. 1990; 124: 797-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Belmont L.D.

In brief, yeast strains were cultured with constant agitation at 24 °C in YPAD broth from single colonies isolated from YPAD agar source plates (freshly streaked from frozen stocks) to prepare cells competent for transformation (see below). For biochemistry, isolated yeast colonies (from SD/glucose (−Leu) agar plates; see below) were maintained with constant agitation at 24 in SD/glucose (−Leu) broth (see below). pSOS encodes truncated (amino acids 1–1067; catalytic domain) human Son-of-Sevenless (hSOS), which is the human homologue of yeast cdc25. This truncated hSOS is incapable of independently localizing to the plasma membrane in yeast (50Aronheim A. Engelberg D., Li, N. al Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 51Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell.

Expression of hSOS is constitutive under the control of the yeast ADH1 promoter (pADH1). Both cdc25 and hSOS are GTP-exchange factors capable of activating Ras-signaling and thus stimulate yeast growth when recruited to the plasma membrane. The cytosolic domains (N and C termini) of α-, β-, and γ-mENaC were amplified with a standard PCR using mouse ENaC subunit cDNAs originally in pBluescript SK− (Stratagene) (47Ahn Y.J. Brooker D.R. Kosari F. Harte B.J., Li, J. Mackler S.A. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F121-F129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR primers (see Table I) engineered restriction sites, which were subsequently used after gel purification of PCR products (GeneClean, QBIOGENE) to subclone the respective fragments in-frame behind hSOS in pSOS to create pSOS-αN, pSOS-αC, pSOS-βN, pSOS-βC pSOS-γN, and pSOS-γC. These constructs encode a hybrid protein containing hSOS proximal to the respective portions of ENaC. Every pSOS-ENaC construct was sequenced to ensure proper orientation, reading frame, and sequence identity.Table IPCR primers used to amplify the NH2 and COOH termini of α-, β-, and γ-mENaC for cloning into pSOS1-150 Original mENaC constructs (in pBluescript SK-) were from T.R.

Only putative cytosolic domains were amplified. 1-160 Engineered restriction sites are noted by underlining. All mutagenesis was completed using QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis per the manufacturer’s instructions.

Open table in a new tab 2-150 End, last amino acid, Phe-F655. EGFP-ENaC fusion proteins were created by subcloning appropriate gel-purified cDNA fragments from pSOS-ENaC plasmids into pEGFP-C2 in-frame behind EGFP. TheBamHI and SacII fragments (into BglII and SacII) from pSOS-αC, -βC, -γN, and -γC were used to create pEGFP-αC, pEGFP-βC, pEGFP-γN, and pEGFP-γC, respectively. The PstI and SacII fragment from pSOS-αN was used to generate pEGFP-αN (from pEGFP-C3). TheBamHI and EcoRI fragment (into BglII and EcoRI) from pSOS-βN was used to generate pEGFP-βN. Every pEGFP-ENaC construct was sequenced to ensure proper orientation, reading frame, and sequence identity. A novel yeast one-hybrid screen developed in our laboratory was used to identify the cytosolic domains within ENaC subunits that are reactive at the plasma membrane. This screen is based upon the SOS recruitment system developed by Aronheim and colleagues (51Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 52Aronheim A. Karin M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 47-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, pSOS-αN, -αC, -βN, -βC, -γN, and -γC were overexpressed in the S. cerevisiae yeast strain cdc25H. A two-stepped screening process involving auxotrophic selection with a leucine marker contained within the pSOS plasmid (leu2) and complementation by hybrid hSOS-ENaC constructs of the temperature-sensitive growth defect inherent to the cdc25H yeast strain was used to identify plasma membrane-reactive ENaC domains. The rationale for this one-hybrid screen is that in order for hSOS-ENaC fusion proteins to complement temperature-sensitive growth, ENaC domains must recruit truncated hSOS (catalytic domain) (50Aronheim A. Engelberg D., Li, N. al Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) to the plasma membrane, where it then is able to activate Ras signaling and promote growth at restrictive temperature (37 °C). Only domains within ENaC that interact with integral or peripheral membrane proteins or membrane lipids will recruit hSOS-ENaC to the membrane and complement. Yeast transformed with the various pSOS-ENaC constructs were initially plated on SD/glucose (−Leu) agar at 24 °C. Colonies were allowed to form over a 4-day period. This source plate then was either replicated with the replica plate maintained at restrictive temperatures (37 °C) or colonies were patched from the source plate in duplicate onto SD/glucose (−Leu) plates to create two identical arrays (see Fig. 1). Arrays were grown in parallel at permissive (24 °C) and non-permissive (37 °C) temperatures. Colony formation (growth) was quantified after 2 days. Digital images of yeast plates were captured with a DC4800 Zoom Digital Camera (Eastman Kodak Co.) interfaced with a PC running Kodak IFSCore software. Competent yeast cells were prepared using standard techniques. In brief, cells were maintained in liquid culture (YPAD broth) at 24 °C until reaching anA600 = 0.7. After rinsing, yeast were treated with LiSORB (100 mm LiOAc, 10 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 m sorbitol, pH 8.0) for 30 min at room temperature, then pelleted, and resuspended in PEG/LiOAc (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mmLiOAc, 40% PEG 3350, pH 8.0) containing 10% Me2SO and ∼0.8 mg/ml sheared and boiled salmon sperm (CLONTECH) as a carrier. Competent yeast (100 μl; titer = 2 × 107 colony-forming units/ml) was transformed with 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA using heat shock (42 °C for 20 min) in the presence of 2 μl of 1.4 mβ-mercaptoethanol. Transformed cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 1 m sorbitol and plated on SD/glucose (−Leu) agar plates using 4-mm glass beads. Amphibian cells were transfected using methods described previously (48Stockand J.D. Spier B.J. Worrell R.T. Yue G., Al- Baldawi N. Eaton D.C. J. Biol.

Cells then were maintained in complete media and used between 24 and 48 h. CHO and mCT1 cells were transfected using Polyfect Transfection Reagents (Qiagen) per the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, cells seeded on number 0 Micro cover glass were treated overnight with 1 ml of DMEM (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) and 150 μl of transfection media containing DMEM plus 2.5 μg of plasmid previously mixed with 15 μl of Polyfect Transfection Reagent for 10 min. Cells were maintained using standard methods following transfection and were used for experimentation over the next 24–48 h. For Western blot analysis of hSOS-ENaC hybrids, inoculates of single yeast colonies were developed at 24 °C in 10 ml of SD/glucose (−Leu) broth for 2–3 days (A600 >1.0). Yeast whole cell extract was prepared by lysing washed and pelleted yeast in cell lysis buffer (CLB; 5 μl/μg pellet weight) containing (in mm) 140 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 10 Na2HPO4, 1.8 KH2PO4, and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (for fungal and yeast cells; Sigma) per 100 μl of CLB. Pellets treated with CLB were vortexed for 5 min at 4 °C in the presence of an equal volume of acid-washed glass beads (0.5 mm diameter). Lysates were then normalized for total protein concentration and sample buffer and 20 mm dithiothreitol added. All Western blot analyses were performed using standard procedures described previously (48Stockand J.D. Spier B.J. Worrell R.T. Yue G., Al- Baldawi N. Eaton D.C. J. Biol.

The magnitude of inhibition can be diminished by autophosphorylation near this pseudosubstrate sequence. Activation of type I cGK (cGKI) and type II cGK (cGKII) are differentially regulated by their cyclic nucleotide-binding sites. To address the possibility that the distinct activation mechanisms of cGKII and cGKI result from differences in the autophosphorylation of the inhibitory domain, we investigated the effects of autophosphorylation on the kinetics of activation. Unlike the type I cGKs (cGKIα and Iβ), cGKII autophosphorylation did not alter the basal activity, nor the sensitivity of the enzyme to cyclic nucleotide activation. To determine residues responsible for autoinhibition of cGKII, Ala was substituted for basic residues (Lys122, Arg118, and Arg119) or a hydrophobic residue (Val125) within the putative pseudosubstrate domain of cGKII. The integrity of these residues was essential for full cGKII autoinhibition. Furthermore, a cGKII truncation mutant containing this autoinhibitory region demonstrated a nanomolar IC50 toward a constitutively active form of cGKII. Finally, we present evidence that the dominant negative properties of this truncation mutant are specific to cGKII when compared with cAMP-dependent protein kinase Cα and cGKIβ. These findings extend the known differences in the activation mechanisms among cGK isoforms and allow the design of an isoform-specific cGKII inhibitor.

Pearson R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The inactive cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAK)1 holoenzyme is activated by cAMP binding to two tandem cyclic nucleotide-binding sites (CNBSs) on the regulatory subunit (R). This event reduces the affinity between the R and catalytic (C) subunits, thus releasing the C subunit from the holoenzyme (2Doskeland S.O. Maronde E. Gjertsen B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) activation is mechanistically similar to the cAKs, although the regulatory and catalytic portions of the kinase are linked domains of the same polypeptide rather than separate subunits (3Pfeifer A.

For both cAKs and cGKs, the autoinhibitory interactions of the holoenzyme complex play a key role in kinase activation by cyclic nucleotides.cAK and cGK autoinhibition is dependent upon the electrostatic interaction between positively charged residues of the pseudosubstrate sequence within the regulatory domain and negatively charged residues within the catalytic cleft (4Francis S.H.

Chem. 1978; 253: 6002-6009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of cAK lowers the K a for cAMP and decreases the rate of association between the type II form of the R and C subunits (6Rangel-Aldao R. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3375-3380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Scott C.W. Mumby M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2274-2280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is due in part to electrostatic repulsion between the acidic residues within the catalytic cleft and the negatively charged phosphates incorporated into the autophosphorylated regulatory domain. Both splice variants of the type I isoform of cGK (Iα and Iβ) share several autoinhibitory characteristics with cAK. First, autophosphorylation within or adjacent to the autoinhibitory (AI) sequence in cGKIβ elevates kinase activity in the absence of cyclic nucleotide and lowers the K a of cAMP and cGMP (8Smith J.A. Francis S.H. Walsh K.A. Kumar S. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20756-20762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Second, cGKIα autophosphorylation decreases the K dof cAMP from one of the cyclic nucleotide-binding sites, lowering theK a for cAMP (9Landgraf W. Hullin R. Gobel C. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Hofmann F. Gensheimer H.P. Gobel C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Some residues responsible for autoinhibition of cAK are conserved in cGKI and -II, including the presence of at least one of the basic residues that make up the pseudosubstrate sequence.The specifics of cGKII activation differ from the cGKI isoform (11Taylor M.K. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28053-28062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) in that the low affinity CNBS is most critical for cGKII activation. The distinct mechanism of activation in cGKII may be because of differences in cGMP regulation of autoinhibition. Alternatively, this distinction may result from similar CNBSs that regulate very distinct autoinhibitory subdomains, as exemplified by the difference in the autoinhibition between the splice variants cGKIα and -Iβ (12Ruth P.

The effects of autophosphorylation and mutation of residues within the putative cGKII autoinhibitory subdomain were examined by monitoring the basal activity of the kinase and its sensitivity to cyclic nucleotide activation. Unlike cGKIα and -Iβ isoforms (8Smith J.A. Francis S.H. Walsh K.A. Kumar S. Corbin J.D. J. Biol.

Additionally, this study demonstrates that a truncated regulatory domain of cGKII possesses dominant negative inhibitory properties in vitro andin vivo. Inhibition by the truncated cGKII regulatory domain was diminished in the presence of cGMP or by mutagenesis of residues critical for autoinhibition. In vivo, the truncated regulatory domain of cGKII showed dominant negative properties toward wild type cGKII in the presence of lower concentrations of 8-Br-cGMP. We also show that the inhibitory properties of the truncated cGKII regulatory domain are specific to cGKII, and did not influence the activity of cGKI or cAK Cα. Given the lack of specificity of many inhibitors structurally analogous to ATP or cyclic nucleotides (15Burkhardt M. Glazova M. Gambaryan S. Vollkommer T. Butt E. Bader B. Heermeier K. Lincoln T.M.

The cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases possess a regulatory domain that suppresses activity at the catalytic site through competitive inhibition of a pseudosubstrate sequence within the regulatory domain (1Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The inactive cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAK)1 holoenzyme is activated by cAMP binding to two tandem cyclic nucleotide-binding sites (CNBSs) on the regulatory subunit (R). This event reduces the affinity between the R and catalytic (C) subunits, thus releasing the C subunit from the holoenzyme (2Doskeland S.O. Maronde E. Gjertsen B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) activation is mechanistically similar to the cAKs, although the regulatory and catalytic portions of the kinase are linked domains of the same polypeptide rather than separate subunits (3Pfeifer A.

P. (1988)J. Neurochem. 51, 665–676) isolated from the adult rat brain. The specificity of the interaction of this particular proteoglycan with IL-3 is due to the abundance of GlcA(2S)β1,3GalNAc(4S)β1 disaccharide units as suggested by1H NMR. Computational docking experiments of the lower energy conformers of the different disaccharides from chondroitin sulfates reveal a privileged binding site for GlcA(2S)β1,3GalNAc(4S)β1 (involving His-26, Arg-29, Asn-70, and Trp-104) localized in an area of IL-3 different from the receptor-binding domain previously identified by others (Bagley, C. J., Phillips, J., Cambareri, B., Vadas, M. A., and Lopez, A. F. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 31922–31928). Molecular modeling of the mutation P33G, described as increasing the biological activity of IL-3 without affecting its receptor binding (Lokker, N. A., Movva, N.

Chem. 266, 10624–10631) provokes a change of the three-dimensional structure of IL-3, especially in the area of the putative carbohydrate recognition domain defined above. Computational docking experiments of the different disaccharides of chondroitin sulfates indicate a loss of affinity for the previous ligand but a higher affinity for the classic disaccharide of chondroitin-4-sulfate. This change from a rare and specific ligand to a more abundant constituent of proteoglycans could induce an increased quantitative association between the IL-3 receptors and its ligands and, consequently, an increased signaling. We demonstrate that human interleukin 3 (IL-3) is a lectin recognizing specifically the glycosaminoglycan part of a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (PGS3; Normand, G., Kuchler, S., Meyer, A., Vincendon, G., and Zanetta, J.

We made the hypothesis that this domain could be a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD)1 as evidenced for several interleukins (1Cebo C. Dambrouck T. Maes E. Laden C. Strecker G. Michalski J.-C.

These negative results were surprising because several studies (3Roberts R. Gallagher J. Spooncer E. Allen T.D. Bloomfield F. Dexter T.M.

The negative results of our previous studies could, at least in part, be explained by the use of a different methodology. In fact, our method (1Cebo C. Dambrouck T. Maes E. Laden C. Strecker G.

Consequently, binding could be observed only when the ligand was present at a stoichiometric level with the cytokine and when the affinity of the cytokine for its ligand was sufficiently high. Because GAGs present large structural varieties and because the commercial GAGs used in the previous study (1Cebo C. Dambrouck T. Maes E. Laden C. Strecker G. Michalski J.-C. Zanetta J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5685-5691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were isolated from non-mammalian organisms, we decided to test the binding of different cytokines to different immobilized proteoglycans previously isolated from the adult rat brain (6Normand G. Kuchler S. Meyer A. Vincendon G. Zanetta J.P. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This study demonstrates the specific binding of IL-3 to a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan isolated from adult rat brain. This compound possesses an unusually high degree of sulfation, with the majority of the disaccharide units formed of 2-O-sulfated glucuronic acid and of 4-O-sulfatedN-acetylgalactosamine as suggested by 1H NMR of its glycosaminoglycan part. Computational docking of the lower energy conformers of the disaccharides from chondroitin-4-sulfate and chondroitin-6-sulfate, chondroitin-4,6-disulfate, chondroitin-2,4-disulfate, and chondroitin-2,6-disulfate results in a specific docking of GlcA(2S)β1,3GalNAc(4S)β1 in the area of Trp-104 previously proposed as a domain of IL-3 necessary for its function. Molecular modeling of the mutation P33G that gives a mutein with increased biological activity (7Lokker N.A. Movva N.R. Strittmatter U. Fagg B. Zenke G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10624-10631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lokker N.A. Zenke G. Strittmatter U. Fagg B. Movva N.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2125-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) indicates a complete modification of this domain (with the complete accessibility of Trp-104). In silico docking of all disaccharides described above indicates that the theoretical best ligand is no more GlcA(2S)β1,3GalNAc(4S)β1 but the classic disaccharide derived from chondroitin-4-sulfate. These data suggest that the increased activity of the P33G mutein is due to a change from a rare disaccharide ligand to a common disaccharide ligand, allowing the increase of IL-3-dependent signaling. Interleukin 1α (IL-1α), -1β, -3, -5, -7 and -8, interferon-γ (IFNγ), and their respective polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Chemicon (Temucula, CA). Monoclonal anti-rabbit IgG, chondroitin sulfate A, B, and C, heparan sulfate, heparin, hyaluronic acid, keratan sulfate, bovine serum albumin, nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT), 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (BCIP), and cetyl-pyridinium chloride (CPC) were from Sigma. Nitrocellulose (0.45 μm pore size) was from Schleicher & Schuell (Darmstadt, Germany). D2O (99.97% purity; Euriso-top®) was from CEA (Saclay, France). Periodate-treated bovine serum albumin was prepared according to Glass et al. (9Glass II, W.F. Briggs R.C. Hnilica L.S. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 115: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In typical preparations, 240 forebrains (from adult Wistar albino rats) were homogenized (5% w/v) in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing protease inhibitors (10 mm EDTA, 100 mm 6-amino-hexanoate, and 5 mm benzamidine hydrochloride) and centrifuged for 2 h at 100,000 ×g. The supernatant and the particulate fractions were treated separately. The particulate fraction (M fraction) was delipidized (10Suzuki K. Life Sci. 1964; 3: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and extracted by stirring for 24 h at 4 °C in 0.1 msodium citrate buffer, pH 3.1, containing the protease inhibitors as above. After centrifugation for 1 h at 23,000 ×g, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was extracted for 48 h at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 4 m guanidinium chloride and protease inhibitors as above. After centrifugation (1 h at 15,000 × g), the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was dialyzed against large volumes of cold water. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation (1 h at 23,000 × g) and extracted again in 0.4 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, over 24 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatants were passed on a DE-52 column (17 × 2.5 cm) previously equilibrated in 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0. Proteoglycans were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1.0 m with a total volume of 200 ml at a flow rate of 30 ml/min. The fractions containing proteoglycans were dialyzed against cold water and lyophilized. After solubilization in a small volume of water, the proteoglycans were precipitated with ethanol (11Endo M. Yosizawa Z. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 1979; 129: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The pellet was homogenized in 4 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.4m NaCl and centrifuged (30 min at 10,000 ×g) at room temperature. The supernatant was submitted to gel filtration. The supernatant fraction of the first extract (S fraction) was precipitated with 0.1% CPC for 24 h at 4 °C (12Brunngraber E.G. Brown B.D. Aguilar V. J. Neurochem. 1969; 16: 1059-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was extracted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 4 m guanidinium chloride and protease inhibitors. Subsequent procedures were identical to those for the M fraction. The material enriched in proteoglycans was fractionated by gel filtration on an Ultrogel AcA22 column (100 × 2.5 cm) previously equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.4 m NaCl. The elution was followed by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and using the carbazole technique (13Dische Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 167: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Seven different proteoglycans were isolated, four from the M fraction (PGM1, PGM2, PGM3, and PGM4) and three from the S fraction (PGS1, PGS2, and PGS3). The nature of these compounds was tested using enzymatic degradation (chondroitinase AC and ABC), nitrous acid treatment (6Normand G. Kuchler S. Meyer A. Vincendon G. Zanetta J.P. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) of heptafluorobutyrate derivatives of the mono- and disaccharides liberated after acid-catalyzed methanolysis in the presence of barium acetate (14Zanetta J.P. Timmerman P. Leroy Y. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For preliminary experiments of binding of cytokines, another preparation of proteoglycans was used, consisting of the material obtained applying the previous procedure without initial separation of the M and S fractions and without separation by gel filtration. Mixtures of proteoglycans or individual compounds were dissolved or suspended in excess (1 mg/ml) in PBS (25 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm NaCl) and 50 μl were added to each microwell. The liquid was evaporated at 50 °C in an oven. The wells were rinsed three times with PBS and then saturated three times for 2 h at room temperature with 300 μl of a 3% solution in PBS of bovine serum albumin previously treated with periodate (9Glass II, W.F. Briggs R.C. Hnilica L.S. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 115: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This treatment eliminated interferences due to the presence of glycoconjugates in commercially available bovine serum albumin preparations. The wells were rinsed three times with PBS and then water. Before use, the wells were saturated again as above and rinsed three times with PBS. Cytokines were added (100 ng in 50 μl of PBS containing 0.3% periodate-treated bovine serum albumin) and left for 2 h at room temperature under rotary agitation. The supernatants were recovered, supplemented with 25 μl of Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) dissociating buffer, boiled for 10 min, and submitted to 13% acrylamide SDS-PAGE in the Laemmli buffer system. The gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose (16Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). The cytokines were revealed using their respective polyclonal anti-cytokine antibodies, followed by alkaline phosphatase (AKP)-labeled anti-rabbit IgG, and finally NBT/BCIP detection of the AKP activity (17Leary J.J. Brigati D.J. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4045-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Purified PGS3 was submitted to mild alkaline hydrolysis (0.1 m NaOH overnight at 4 °C with stirring) in order to liberateO-linked glycans (GAGs and eventually O-glycans). The sample was neutralized with 0.5 m HCl and then dialyzed (24 h at 4 °C) against precooled distilled water. The dialysate and the remaining samples were dried under vacuum at room temperature in a rotary evaporator. The material retained in the dialysis tube (likely containing GAGs and proteins) was centrifuged, and the supernatant was precipitated with 0.1% CPC overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the pellet was suspended in water, and excess CPC was extracted three times with isoamyl alcohol. The remaining aqueous phase was evaporated to dryness, and the sample was exchanged against D2O for1H NMR analysis. Prior to NMR spectroscopic analysis, the sample was repeatedly exchanged in D2O with intermediate freeze-drying and then dissolved in 250 μl of D2O. The sample was analyzed in 200 × 5 mm BMS-005-B Shigemi® tubes at 300 and 315 K on a Bruker ASX400-NB spectrometer (1H 400.33MHz, Centre Commun de Mesure RMN, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France) equipped with a double resonance (1H/X) broadband inverse z-gradient probe head. Data were recorded without sample spinning, and chemical shifts were expressed in ppm downfield from the acetone proton signal (Δ1H, 2.225 ppm). The structures of low energy conformers of the disaccharide ligand of IL-3 were obtained using the minimization and random searching tools within the SYBYL 2002 version (SYBYL, Tripos Inc., St Louis, MO; www.tripos.com). Parameters for the internal rotation potentials are those obtained in our group. 3V. Durier, P. Lagant, S. Kirillova, and G. Vergoten, submitted for publication. The electrostatic charges were derived from quantum mechanical calculations using the Jaguar software (Jaguar version 4.0, Schrödinger Inc., Portland, OR; www.schrodinger.com). The density functional theory was used at the B3LYP/6–31G* level. For that purpose, the molecular electrostatic potential has been fitted to a set of point charges located at the atomic centers, reproducing the dipole moment. The electrostatic potential itself was computed on a spherical grid. A random conformational search technique was used to sample the conformational space. The two glycosidic linkage rotatable bonds and five rotatable bonds for substituents were defined. The structures of low energy conformers were then compared with those of disaccharides of classic chondroitin sulfate. In all cases, 20,000,000 configurations were examined using bump checking (with a van der Waals scaling factor of 0.7) and energy as criteria. For the five lower energy conformers of the five disaccharides of chondroitin sulfates, a surface docking with IL-3 (PDB1JL1) has been investigated. The Global RangeMolecular Matching (GRAMM, 2002 version) program was used (18Katchalski-Katzir E. Shariv I. Eisenstein M. Friesen A.A. Aflalo C. Vasker I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2195-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). This technique locates the area of the global minimum of intermolecular energy for the structure, with different accuracy. The generic mode and a grid step of 1.7 were used. 1000 matches were stored, among which 100, 10, and 5 were displayed. For the lower energy disaccharide/IL-3 complexes, a dynamic energy-based optimization was performed. The data of the conformations of the disaccharides and of the docking experiments were analyzed as PDB files using the Swiss-Pdb-Viewer (www.expasy.ch) and/or the Weblab ViewerLite 4.0 and 4.2 (www.msi.com). For the computational study of the possible modification of the three-dimensional structure of IL-3 under the effect of specific mutations, amino acids were altered using the mutate option of the SYBYL software, followed by the classic program of energy minimization for the whole molecule. Using the technique described above (see “Materials and Methods”), none of the cytokines bound to a mixture of commercially available glycosaminoglycans (not shown; see Ref. 1Cebo C. Dambrouck T. Maes E. Laden C. Strecker G. Michalski J.-C. Zanetta J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5685-5691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar for IL-1α, -1β, -4, -6, and -7). Because binding of cytokines to proteoglycans was reported, we tested the binding of these cytokines to a mixture of proteoglycans isolated from the adult rat brain (6Normand G. Kuchler S. Meyer A. Vincendon G. Zanetta J.P. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, the different cytokines showed different behavior. IL-1β, -5, and -7 did not show any binding. The same was found for IL-1α and interferon-γ despite the low efficiency of the antibodies used here. The behavior of IL-8 could not be studied; the antibody always gave negative results even when IL-8 was directly submitted to SDS-PAGE and blotting, probably because of the specific antibody reactivity against the non-denatured form of IL-8. In contrast, IL-3 showed an important binding to this mixture, which was considered as specific because it was not observed in wells lacking the proteoglycans (Fig. 1 A) and was the only cytokine showing a strong binding. The different behavior of IL-3 on mixtures of GAGs and on mixtures of different proteoglycans was surprising, because the proteoglycan mixture actually contained chondroitin sulfate A and B, keratan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and hyaluronic acid (the latter found as a contaminant in the preparations). Because this mixture contained seven different proteoglycans (6Normand G. Kuchler S. Meyer A. Vincendon G. Zanetta J.P. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), four derived from the membrane fraction (PGM1, PGM2, PGM3, and PGM4) and three from the soluble fraction (PGS1, PGS2, and PGS3) of adult rat brain, these components were individually immobilized on plastic microwells. When the wells were supplemented with 100 ng of IL-3, 20 and 90% of IL-3 were bound to PGM2 and PGS3, respectively (Fig. 1 B). The binding to PGM1, PGM3, PGM4, PGS1, and PGS2 was negligible in contrast with PGS3 (90 ng for 1 μg of immobilized PGS3, instead of 20 ng for 10 μg of immobilized PGM2). Enzymatic and chemical degradations (6Normand G. Kuchler S. Meyer A. Vincendon G. Zanetta J.P. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and GC/MS analysis (14Zanetta J.P. Timmerman P. Leroy Y. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) allowed precise measurement of the specificity of the binding of IL-3. Indeed, PGM1 was a mixture of hyaluronic acid and a proteoglycan containing heparan sulfate and a chondroitin sulfate chain, whereas PGM2, PGM3, and PGM4 were similar but were not contaminated with hyaluronic acid. In contrast, PGS1, PGS2, and PGS3 were all chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans devoid of heparan sulfates and dermatan sulfate, as verified by the complete degradation of the GAG portion using chondroitinase AC (6Normand G. Kuchler S. Meyer A. Vincendon G. Zanetta J.P. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was suggested that the ligand of IL-3 was a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. The absence of characteristic disaccharides released from heparan sulfates and the absence of iduronic acid, together with the unique presence of disaccharides derived from chondroitin sulfates, observed by GC/MS (14Zanetta J.P. Timmerman P. Leroy Y. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) verified these conclusions. Based on chemical analysis (6Normand G. Kuchler S. Meyer A. Vincendon G. Zanetta J.P. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), PGS3 differed from the other proteoglycans by its higher ratio of sulfate relative to GalNAc (1.63/1.00), between 0.34 for PGM3 and 0.81 for PGS2. Throughout the different proteoglycans of the M fraction, PGM2 also showed a higher degree of sulfation. This higher level of sulfation might explain the specific binding of IL-3 to these particular chondroitin sulfate brain proteoglycans and not to the others, as well as to commercially available A and C chondroitin sulfates. To determine the nature of the interaction between PGS3 and IL-3, we performed inhibition experiments of the binding with glycans isolated from PGS3. In fact, the monosaccharide analysis of PGS3 (6Normand G. Kuchler S. Meyer A. Vincendon G. Zanetta J.P. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of a significant amount of mannose in the molecule, indicating the presence of O- orN-linked glycans. Consequently, it was necessary to confirm that the binding of IL-3 to PGS3 was not because of these glycans. Therefore, after a mild β-elimination procedure, the small oligosaccharides were dialyzed and separated from the non-dialyzable material, including chondroitin sulfate chains and the protein portion (possibly associated with N-glycans). The two different fractions were tested for their inhibitory properties for the binding of IL-3 to the immobilized intact PGS3. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the dialyzed material was not inhibitory, in contrast with the non-dialyzable material (not shown). The inhibitory material was purified by precipitation with CPC. As shown in Fig. 1 C, only the GAG portion of PGS3 was inhibitory. Therefore, these experiments demonstrated that the high affinity ligand of IL-3 was the GAG portion of PGS3. The specificity of the binding of IL-3 to PGS3 was likely due to its peculiar sulfation pattern, because chondroitin 4 and 6 sulfates from whale cartilage (Sigma) were inactive. To determine the positions of the sulfate groups in the chondroitin chain, the glycosaminoglycan part of PGS3 liberated by mild alkaline hydrolysis (see “Materials and Methods”) was submitted to1H NMR analysis at 300 and 315 K. The chemical shifts of different protons indicated that, despite an heterogeneity, the majority of the material was composed of GlcA sulfated in position 2 and of GalNAc sulfated in position 4. Indeed, no signal was detected for the H2 protons of βGlcA at 3.375–3.379 ppm (19Clement A.M. Nadanaka S. Masayama K. Mandl C. Sugahara K. Faissner A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12654-12665Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) characteristic of non-sulfated GlcA and around 3.64 ppm characteristic of 3-sulfated GlcA. In contrast, the characteristic downfield-shifted signal at 4.11 ppm of 2-sulfated GlcA (20Nadanaka S. Clement A. Masayama K. Faissner A. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3296-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) was observed. This conclusion was reinforced by the presence of the downfield-shifted signal (4.80 instead of 4.45 ppm) of the anomeric proton of GlcA. This indicated that at least 90% of the GlcA residues were sulfated in position 2. For GalNAc, two signals corresponding to the H4 protons were detected at 4.19 and 4.75 ppm in the proportion 1:2, indicating the presence of both non-sulfated GalNAc at 4.19 ppm and 4-sulfated GalNAc at 4.75 ppm (22Kinoshita A. Yamada S. Haslam S.M. Morris H.R. Dell A. Sugahara K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12654-12665Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, these data indicated that the major disaccharide repetitive units of PGS3 were GlcA(2S)β1,3GalNAc(4S)β1-, the other being GlcA(2S)β1,3GalNAcβ1- (in a molar ratio of 2:1). The conformations of the lower energy conformers of the disaccharide ligand of IL-3 GlcA(2S)β1,3GalNAc(4S)β1 were calculated and compared with the conformations of the disaccharides of classic chondroitin sulfate A, GlcAβ1,3GalNAc(4S)β1, and chondroitin sulfate C, GlcAβ1,3GalNAc(6S)β1, and with those of GlcA(2S)β1,3GalNAc(6S)β1 and of GlcAβ1,3GalNAc(4,6S)β1. As shown in Fig. 2, the five lower energy conformers of the disaccharide ligands of IL-3, GlcA(2S)β1,3GalNAc(4S)β1, showed two groups of compounds, with the different energy in each group caused by the presence of different intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Compound A in Fig. 2 showed the lowest energy (0.7 kcal·mol−1 lower than compoundB and 1.2 kcal·mol−1 lower than the three other conformers). These five lower energy conformers differed from the others by a jump in energy of higher than 5 kcal·mol−1. For the five families of disaccharides, the five lower energy conformers were submitted to computational docking into the three-dimensional structure of IL-3, accessible as PDB 1JL1. The non-ligand oligosaccharides showed a quasi-random distribution with a predominance of localization in the area containing His-95 and -98 (not shown), with fine analysis showing that the major interactions were of ionic nature. Because the calculations were performed in vacuo (ε = 1), these types of interactions were considered very unlikely to take place in vivo. The absence of van der Waals interactions and/or hydrogen bonds with the surrounding amino acids reinforced this conclusion. This was not the case for the lower energy conformers of GlcA(2S)β1,3GalNAc(4S)β1 because 70% of them were found in the area of His-26, Arg-29, Asn-70, and Trp-104 (Fig.3 A). When the experiments included only the 10 energy conformers of the IL-3 ligand, the partition became 3 to 7 in the same sites (Fig. 3 B). This ratio was 1:4 for the five lower energy conformers of the ligand of IL-3 (Fig. 3 C). The fine analysis of the results of the docking experiments of the five lower energy conformers indicated a preferential localization of four of them in close apposition to the Trp-104 residue. The exception was one that localized in the area of His-95 and -98 (Fig. 3 C). As discussed above, this site was rejected as a putative CRD because of the predominance of ionic bonds and the absence of van der Waals interactions. The other conformers all localized in the same region, and all interacted with Trp-104 through strong van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonding with surrounding amino acids. As shown in Fig. 4 A, for the lower energy conformers (shown in Fig. 2) this site was essentially different from that defined (23Bagley C.J. Phillips J. Cambareri B. Vadas M.A. Lopez A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31922-31928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) as the receptor-binding site of IL-3 (Fig. 4 A, blue). The fine analysis of the docking data of the four lower energy conformers of GlcA(2S)β1,3GalNAc(4S)β1 indicated the same major features, van der Waals interactions with Trp-104 and His-26 and hydrogen bonds with the same amino acids.
