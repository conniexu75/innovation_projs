https://openalex.org/W2951696890,"Published data on the mechanical strength and elasticity of lung tissue is widely variable, primarily due to differences in how testing was conducted across individual studies. This makes it extremely difficult to find a benchmark modulus of lung tissue when designing synthetic extracellular matrices (ECMs). To address this issue, we tested tissues from various areas of the lung using multiple characterization techniques, including micro-indentation, small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS), uniaxial tension, and cavitation rheology. We report the sample preparation required and data obtainable across these unique but complimentary methods to quantify the modulus of lung tissue. We highlight cavitation rheology as a new method, which can measure the modulus of intact tissue with precise spatial control, and reports a modulus on the length scale of typical tissue heterogeneities. Shear rheology, uniaxial, and indentation testing require heavy sample manipulation and destruction; however, cavitation rheology can be performed in situ across nearly all areas of the lung with minimal preparation. The Young's modulus of bulk lung tissue using micro-indentation (1.4±0.4 kPa), SAOS (3.3±0.5 kPa), uniaxial testing (3.4±0.4 kPa), and cavitation rheology (6.1±1.6 kPa) were within the same order of magnitude, with higher values consistently reported from cavitation, likely due to our ability to keep the tissue intact. Although cavitation rheology does not capture the non-linear strains revealed by uniaxial testing and SAOS, it provides an opportunity to measure mechanical characteristics of lung tissue on a microscale level on intact tissues. Overall, our study demonstrates that each technique has independent benefits, and each technique revealed unique mechanical features of lung tissue that can contribute to a deeper understanding of lung tissue mechanics."
https://openalex.org/W2896813671,"Urban green space (UGS) has many environmental and social benefits. UGS provision and access are increasingly considered in urban policies and must rely on data and indicators that can capture variations in the distribution of UGS within cities. There is no consensus about how UGS, and their provision and access, must be defined from different land use data types. Here we identify four spatial dimensions of UGS and critically examine how different data sources affect these dimensions and our understanding of their variation within a city region (Brussels). We compare UGS indicators measured from an imagery source (NDVI from Landsat), an official cadastre-based map, and the voluntary geographical information provided by OpenStreetMap (OSM). We compare aggregate values of provision and access to UGS as well as their spatial distribution along a centrality gradient and at neighbourhood scale. We find that there are strong differences in the value of indicators when using the different datasets, especially due to their ability to capture private and public green space. However we find that the interpretation of intra-urban spatial variations is not affected by changes in data source. Centrality in particular is a strong determinant of the relative values of UGS availability, fragmentation and accessibility, irrespective of datasets."
https://openalex.org/W2897147755,"The Mesobiotus harmsworthi group has a global distribution, with localities in polar, temperate and tropical zones. Since the first species of the harmsworthi group was described in the beginning of the 20th century, tens of new species within the group were found and named. However, the diagnosis of the nominal Mesobiotus harmsworthi is insufficient and enigmatic, thus it can be is a serious obstacle in solving the taxonomy of this group. Here, we integratively redescribe the nominal species for the genus Mesobiotus, i.e., Mesobiotus harmsworthi and clarify taxonomic statuses of the two subspecies: M. harmsworthi harmsworthi and M. harmsworthi obscurus that have been recognised as distinct taxa for more than three decades. Traditionally, egg chorion in M. harmsworthi was considered almost smooth and without any traces of areolation, however here we report many misunderstandings that accumulated across decades and we show that, in fact, the chorion in this species exhibits a partially developed areolation. We present an integrative (morphological, morphometric and molecular) diagnosis of the nominal taxon and we confirm that it differs from other species of the harmsworthi group by morphological characters of both animals and eggs. Additionally, we describe two new species of the genus Mesobiotus: M. skorackii sp. nov. from the Kyrgyz Republic (using classical morphological description) and M. occultatus sp. nov. from Svalbard Archipelago (by means of integrative taxonomy). Finally, we also provide the first genetic phylogeny of the genus Mesobiotus based on COI sequences which, together with molecular species delimitation, independently confirms the validity of the analysed taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2897278817,"Aims Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a myocardial disorder that can result in progressive heart failure and arrhythmias, is defined by ventricular chamber enlargement and dilatation, and systolic dysfunction. Despite extensive research, the pathological mechanisms of DCM are unclear mainly due to numerous mutations in different gene families resulting in the same outcome—decreased ventricular function. Titin (TTN)—a giant protein, expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles, is an important part of the sarcomere, and thus TTN mutations are the most common cause of adult DCM. To decipher the basis for the cardiac pathology in titin-mutated patients, we investigated the hypothesis that induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) generated from patients, recapitulate the disease phenotype. The hypothesis was tested by 3 Aims: (1) Investigate key features of the excitation-contraction-coupling machinery; (2) Investigate the responsiveness to positive inotropic interventions; (3) Investigate the proteome profile of the AuP cardiomyocytes using mass-spectrometry (MS). Methods and results iPSC were generated from the patients' skin fibroblasts. The major findings were: (1) Sarcomeric organization analysis in mutated iPSC-CM showed defects in assembly and maintenance of sarcomeric structure. (2) Mutated iPSC-CM exhibited diminished inotropic and lusitropic responses to β-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol, increased [Ca2+]out and angiotensin-II. Additionally, mutated iPSC-CM displayed prolonged recovery in response to caffeine. These findings may result from defective or lack of interactions of the sarcomeric components with titin through its kinase domain which is absent in the mutated cells. Conclusions These findings show that the mutated cardiomyocytes from DCM patients recapitulate abnormalities of the inherited cardiomyopathies, expressed as blunted inotropic response."
https://openalex.org/W2897809616,"Production of phosphorus efficient crop cultivars can increase food productivity and decrease environmental pollution. Categorization of existing germplasm is a prerequisite to develop P efficient crop cultivars. For first experiment, 30 wheat genotypes were grown in hydroponics with two P levels (i.e., deficit, 20 μm KH2PO4 and adequate, 200 μm KH2PO4). Genotypes differed significantly for various P efficiency parameters. Two genotypes (Dirk and Bhakkar-02) showed < 25% decrease in growth at P deficiency. Genotype Seher-06 proved to be inefficient. Twelve selected genotypes based on the first experiment were sown in soil with two P levels (0 and 30 mg P kg-1) till maturity. As expected, genotypes differed for grain yield at both P levels. The efficient cultivars selected on the basis of both absolute and relative dry matter production at both P levels such as Dirk. Genotypes were grouped into three, four and nine classes on the basis of various parameters for P efficiency as proposed by different researchers. Most genotypes behaved in a similar fashion by different categorization methods and also at different P supply. The method to categorize the genotypes into three classes and plotting them into 9 classes proposed by Gill and his coworkers, is the best to differentiate the minor differences in genotypes. At least three different parameters at both P regimes should be used. The parameters may vary as per objectives of the study and/or growth conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2897210153,"Physical activity is associated with a lower risk of disease recurrence among colon cancer patients. Circulating tumor cells (CTC) are prognostic of disease recurrence among stage I-III colon cancer patients. The pathways through which physical activity may alter disease outcomes are unknown, but may be mediated by changes in CTCs.Participants included 23 stage I-III colon cancer patients randomized into one of three groups: usual-care control, 150 min∙wk-1 of aerobic exercise (low-dose), and 300 min∙wk-1 of aerobic exercise (high-dose) for six months. CTCs from venous blood were quantified in a blinded fashion using an established microfluidic antibody-mediated capture device. Poisson regression models estimated the logarithmic counts of CTCs.At baseline, 78% (18/23) of patients had ≥1 CTC. At baseline, older age (-0.12±0.06; P = 0.04), lymphovascular invasion (0.63±0.25; P = 0.012), moderate/poor histology (1.09±0.34; P = 0.001), body mass index (0.07±0.02; P = 0.001), visceral adipose tissue (0.08±0.04; P = 0.036), insulin (0.06±0.02; P = 0.011), sICAM-1 (0.04±0.02; P = 0.037), and sVCAM-1 (0.06±0.03; P = 0.045) were associated with CTCs. Over six months, significant decreases in CTCs were observed in the low-dose (-1.34±0.34; P<0.001) and high-dose (-1.18±0.40; P = 0.004) exercise groups, whereas no significant change was observed in the control group (-0.59±0.56; P = 0.292). Over six months, reductions in body mass index (-0.07±0.02; P = 0.007), insulin (-0.08±0.03; P = 0.014), and sICAM-1 (-0.07±0.03; P = 0.005) were associated with reductions in CTCs. The main limitations of this proof-of-concept study are the small sample size, heterogenous population, and per-protocol statistical analysis.Exercise may reduce CTCs among stage I-III colon cancer patients. Changes in host factors correlated with changes in CTCs. Exercise may have a direct effect on CTCs and indirect effects through alterations in host factors. This hypothesis-generating observation derived from a small pilot study warrants further investigation and replication."
https://openalex.org/W2897091391,"Wheat yield dynamic in Canada, USA, Russia and Kazakhstan from 1981 till 2015 was related to air temperature and precipitation during wheat season to evaluate the effects of climate change. The study used yield data from the provinces, states and regions and average yield from 19 spring wheat breeding/research sites. Both at production and research sites grain yield in Eurasia was two times lower compared to North America. The yearly variations in grain yield in North America and Eurasia did not correlate suggesting that higher yield in one region was normally associated with lower yield in another region. Minimum and maximum air temperature during the wheat growing season (April-August) had tendency to increase. While precipitation in April-August increased in North American sites from 289 mm in 1981–1990 to 338 mm in 2006–2015 it remained constant and low at Eurasian sites (230 and 238 mm, respectively). High temperature in June and July negatively affected grain yield in most of the sites at both continents. Climatic changes resulted in substantial changes in the dates of planting and harvesting normally leading to extension of growing season. Longer planting-harvesting period was positively associated with the grain yield for most of the locations. The climatic changes since 1981 and spring wheat responses suggest several implications for breeding. Gradual warming extends the wheat growing season and new varieties need to match this to utilize their potential. Higher rainfall during the wheat season, especially in North America, will require varieties with higher yield potential responding to moisture availability. June is a critical month for spring wheat in both regions due to the significant negative correlation of grain yield with maximum temperature and positive correlation with precipitation. Breeding for adaptation to higher temperatures during this period is an important strategy to increase yield."
https://openalex.org/W2897308393,"Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands (Pc) is a hemibiotrophic oomycete and the causal agent of Phytophthora root rot (PRR) of the commercially important fruit crop avocado (Persea americana Mill.). Plant defense against pathogens is modulated by phytohormone signaling pathways such as salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene (ET), auxin and abscisic acid. The role of specific signaling pathways induced and regulated during hemibiotroph-plant interactions has been widely debated. Some studies report SA mediated defense while others hypothesize that JA responses restrict the spread of pathogens. This study aimed to identify the role of SA- and JA- associated genes in the defense strategy of a resistant avocado rootstock, Dusa in response to Pc infection. Transcripts associated with SA-mediated defense pathways and lignin biosynthesis were upregulated at 6 hours post-inoculation (hpi). Results suggest that auxin, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+ signaling was also important during this early time point, while JA signaling was absent. Both SA and JA defense responses were shown to play a role during defense at 18 hpi. Induction of genes associated with ROS detoxification and cell wall digestion (β-1-3-glucanase) was also observed. Most genes induced at 24 hpi were linked to JA responses. Other processes at play in avocado at 24 hpi include cell wall strengthening, the formation of phenolics and induction of arabinogalactan, a gene linked to Pc zoospore immobility. This study represents the first transcriptome wide analysis of a resistant avocado rootstock treated with SA and JA compared to Pc infection. The results provide evidence of a biphasic defense response against the hemibiotroph, which initially involves SA-mediated gene expression followed by the enrichment of JA-mediated defense from 18 to 24 hpi. Genes and molecular pathways linked to Pc resistance are highlighted and may serve as future targets for manipulation in the development of PRR resistant avocado rootstocks."
https://openalex.org/W2949135247,"Infection of immunocompromised individuals with normally benign opportunistic viruses is a major health burden globally. Infections with viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Kaposi's sarcoma virus (KSHV), adenoviruses (AdV), BK virus (BKPyV), John Cunningham virus (JCPyV), and human papillomavirus (HPV) are significant concerns for the immunocompromised, including when these viruses exist as a co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These viral infections are more complicated in patients with a weakened immune system, and often manifest as malignancies resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Vaccination is not an attractive option for these immune compromised individuals due to defects in their adaptive immune response. Verdinexor is part of a novel class of small molecules known as SINE (Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export) compounds. These small molecules demonstrate specificity for the nuclear export protein XPO1, to which they bind and block function, resulting in sequestration of XPO1-dependent proteins in the nucleus of the cell. In antiviral screening, verdinexor demonstrated varying levels of efficacy against all of the aforementioned viruses including previously with HIV. Studies by other labs have discussed likely mechanisms of action for verdinexor (ie. XPO1-dependence) against each virus. GLP toxicology studies suggest that anti-viral activity can be achieved at a tolerable dose range, based on the safety profile of a previous phase 1 clinical trial of verdinexor in healthy human volunteers. Taken together, these results indicate verdinexor has the potential to be a broad spectrum antiviral for immunocompromised subjects for which vaccination is a poor option."
https://openalex.org/W2897070311,"Student engagement during classes includes behavioural, cognitive and emotional components, and is a pre-requisite for successful active learning environments. A novel approach to measuring student engagement was developed, involving triangulation of real-time student-self report, observation by trained observers and heart rate measurement. The self-report instrument was evaluated in four separate cohorts (n = 123) at Monash University and the University of North Carolina. The six item self-report demonstrated good reliability (Cronbach’s alpha values ranged from 0.7–0.81). The self-report showed predictive validity in that small group activities were rated as significantly more engaging than didactic lecturing. Additionally, there was significant inter-instructor variability and within-class variability, indicating good discrimination between classroom activities. This self-report may prove useful to academic teaching staff in evaluating and refining their active learning activities. Independent observation was not found to correlate with student self-report, due in part to students who were pretending to engage being rated as engaged by an observer. Strikingly, students reported that they were pretending to engage for 23% of class time, even for highly regarded instructors. Individual participants were rated as engaged for 42 of the 46 intervals for which they reported that they had “pretended to engage”, indicating that the two observers were unable to detect disengagement during periods in which students pretended to engage. Instructors should be aware that student cues such as eye contact and nodding may indicate pretending to engage. One particular self-report item; “I tried a new approach or way of thinking about the content”, correlated positively with heart rates, and a controlled study reproduced this finding during two activities that required students to try a new approach to understanding a concept. Agreement with this item also correlated with superior performance on two in-class written assessment tasks (n = 101, p<0.01). Further use of this tool and related educational research may be useful to identify in-class activities that are engaging and likely to lead to improved student attainment of learning outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2896826968,"Over the past few decades, a growing body of epidemiological studies found the effects of temperature on cardiovascular disease, including the risk for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Our study aimed to investigate whether there is an association between extremely temperature and acute myocardial infarction hospital admission in Beijng, China. We obtained 81029 AMI cases and daily temperature data from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016. We employed a time series design and modeled distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) to analyze effects of temperature on daily AMI cases. Compared with the 10th percentile temperature measured by daily mean temperature (Tmean), daily minimum temperature (Tmin) and daily minimum apparent temperature (ATmin), the cumulative relative risks (CRR) at 1st percentile of Tmean, Tmin and ATmin for AMI hospitalization were 1.15(95% CI: 1.02, 1.30), 1.24(95% CI: 1.11, 1.38) and 1.41(95% CI: 1.18, 1.68), respectively. Moderate low temperature (10th vs 25th) also had adverse impact on AMI events. The susceptive groups were males and people 65 years and older. No associations were found between high temperature and AMI risk. The main limitation of the study is temperature exposure was not individualized. These findings on cold-associated AMI hospitalization helps characterize the public health burden of cold and target interventions to reduce temperature induced AMI occurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2884628150,"Sexual desire discrepancy is one of the most frequently reported sexual concerns for individuals and couples and has been shown to be negatively associated with sexual and relationship satisfaction. Sexual desire has increasingly been examined as a state-like construct that ebbs and flows, but little is known about whether there are patterns in the fluctuation of sexual desire. Utilizing spectral and cross-spectral analysis, we transformed 30 days of dyadic daily diary data for perceived levels of sexual desire for a non-clinical sample of 133 couples (266 individuals) into the frequency domain to identify shared periodic state fluctuations in sexual desire. Spectral analysis is a technique commonly used in physics and engineering that allows time series data to be analyzed for the presence of regular cycles of fluctuation. Cross-spectral analysis allows for dyadic data to be analyzed for shared rates of fluctuation between partners as well as the degree of (a)synchrony (or phase shift) between these fluctuations. Men and women were found to exhibit fluctuations in sexual desire at various frequencies including rates of once and twice per month, and to have sexual desire that was unlikely to fluctuate over periods of three days or less and therefore exhibited persistence. Similar patterns of fluctuation were exhibited within couples and these patterns were found to be largely synchronous. While instances of desire discrepancy may arise due to differences in rates of sexual desire fluctuation and random fluctuations, such instances may be normal for romantic relationships. The results have important implications for researchers, clinicians, and educators in that they corroborate the supposition that sexual desire ebbs and flows and suggest that it does so with predictable regularity."
https://openalex.org/W2896431229,"New therapeutic biological entities such as bispecific antibodies targeting tissue or specific cell populations form an increasingly important part of the drug development portfolio. However, these biopharmaceutical agents bear the risk of extensive target-mediated drug disposition or atypical pharmacokinetic properties as compared to canonical antibodies. Pharmacokinetics and bio-distribution studies become therefore more and more important during lead optimization. Biologics present, however, greater analytical challenges than small molecule drugs due to the mass and selectivity limitation of mass spectrometry and ligand-binding assay, respectively. Radiocarbon (14C) and its detection methods, such as the emerging 14C cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS), thus can play an important role in the large molecule quantitation where a 14C-tag is covalently bound through a stable linker. CRDS has the advantage of a simplified sample preparation and introduction system as compared to accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) and can be accommodated within an ordinary research laboratory. In this study, we report on the labeling of an anti-IL17 IgG1 model antibody with 14C propionate tag and its detection by CRDS using it as nanotracer (2.1 nCi or 77.7 Bq blended with the therapeutic dose) in a pharmacokinetics study in a preclinical species. We compare these data to data generated by AMS in parallel processed samples. The derived concentration time profiles for anti-IL17 by CRDS were in concordance with the ones derived by AMS and γ-counting of an 125I-labeled anti-IL17 radiotracer and were well described by a 2-compartment population pharmacokinetic model. In addition, antibody tissue distribution coefficients for anti-IL17 were determined by CRDS, which proved to be a direct and sensitive measurement of the extravascular tissue concentration of the antibody when tissue perfusion was applied. Thus, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that trace 14C-radiolabels and CRDS are an ultrasensitive approach in (pre)clinical pharmacokinetics and bio-distribution studies of new therapeutic entities."
https://openalex.org/W2896971219,"The concerted activity of neuron-glia networks is responsible for the fascinating dynamics of brain functions. Although these networks have been extensively investigated using a variety of experimental (in vivo and in vitro) and theoretical models, the manner by which neuron-glia networks interact is not fully understood. In particular, how neuromodulators influence network-level signaling between neurons and astrocytes was poorly addressed. In this work, we investigated global effects of the neuromodulator norepinephrine (NE) on neuron-astrocyte network communication in co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes and in isolated astrocyte networks. Electrical stimulation was used to activate the neuron-astrocyte glutamate-mediated pathway. Our results showed dramatic changes in network activity under applied global perturbations. Under neuromodulation, there was a marked rise in calcium signaling in astrocytes, neuronal spontaneous activity was reduced, and the communication between neuron-astrocyte networks was perturbed. Moreover, in the presence of NE, we observed two astrocyte behaviors based on their coupling to neurons. There were also morphological changes in astrocytes upon application of NE, suggesting a physical cause underlies the change in signaling. Our results shed light on the role of NE in controlling sleep-wake cycles."
https://openalex.org/W2897132682,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a prominent role in post-transcriptional gene expression regulation and have been involved in various biological and metabolic processes to regulate gene expression. For Brassica napus, improving seed-weight and oil-content is the main breeding goal. In order to better understand the regulation mechanism of miRNAs during seed-weight formation and oil-content accumulation in B. napus, in this study, a high-throughput sequencing technology was used to profile miRNAs expression of Brassica napus immature seeds from one to six weeks after flowering. A total of 1,276 miRNAs, including 1,248 novel and 28 known miRNAs, were obtained from both the high-seed-weight with low-oil-content RNA pool (S03) and the low-seed-weight with high-oil-content RNA pool (S04). Analysis of their expression profiles disclosed that 300 novel and two known miRNAs were differentially expressed between S03 and S04. For degradome analysis, 57 genes with 64 degradation sites were predicted to be targeted for degradation by these miRNAs. Further bioinformatics analysis indicated that these differentially expressed miRNAs might participate in regulation of myriad cellular and molecular processes, during seed development and oil synthesis. Finally, 6 target genes with potential roles in regulation of seed development and 9 other targets in seed oil synthesis, were further confirmed as candidate genes from small RNA and degradome sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W2897259334,"China harbors diversified forest types, from tropical rainforest to boreal coniferous forest, and has implemented large-scale reforestation/afforestation programs over the past several decades. However, little information is available on changes in China’s forest area and the causes. In this study, we used the classified forest distribution thematic map derived from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets and a revised IPAT model to examine China’s forest area change and the possible driving factors from 1982 to 2006. Overall, NDVI-derived forest areas were numerically consistent with those reported in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th National Forest Inventories, respectively. Over the past 25 years, China’s forest area was estimated to have an average of 169.18 million hectares with an annual increase of 0.15 million hectares (c.a. a total net increment of 3.60 million hectares), which is equivalent to 0.089% of the relative annual change rate. However, a large difference in the changing rate and direction of forest area at the province level was found; for instance, forest area has declined in 10 provinces, mainly in Northeastern and Southern China, while 21 provinces showed an increase. The changes were most likely attributed to the policy regarding the import and export of timber and affluence (per capita gross domestic product), and both contributed more than 80% of the total contribution of the six factors of the revised IPAT model."

https://openalex.org/W2892703960,"Background Over the past decade, machine learning techniques have revolutionized how research and science are done, from designing new materials and predicting their properties to data mining and analysis to assisting drug discovery to advancing cybersecurity. Recently, we added to this list by showing how a machine learning algorithm (a so-called learner) combined with an optimization routine can assist experimental efforts in the realm of tuning semiconductor quantum dot (QD) devices. Among other applications, semiconductor quantum dots are a candidate system for building quantum computers. In order to employ QDs, one needs to tune the devices into a desirable configuration suitable for quantum computing. While current experiments adjust the control parameters heuristically, such an approach does not scale with the increasing size of the quantum dot arrays required for even near-term quantum computing demonstrations. Establishing a reliable protocol for tuning QD devices that does not rely on the gross-scale heuristics developed by experimentalists is thus of great importance. Materials and methods To implement the machine learning-based approach, we constructed a dataset of simulated QD device characteristics, such as the conductance and the charge sensor response versus the applied electrostatic gate voltages. The gate voltages are the experimental ‘knobs’ for tuning the device into useful regimes. Here, we describe the methodology for generating the dataset, as well as its validation in training convolutional neural networks. Results and discussion From 200 training sets sampled randomly from the full dataset, we show that the learner’s accuracy in recognizing the state of a device is ≈ 96.5% when using either current-based or charge-sensor-based training. The spread in accuracy over our 200 training sets is 0.5% and 1.8% for current- and charge-sensor-based data, respectively. In addition, we also introduce a tool that enables other researchers to use this approach for further research: QFlow lite—a Python-based mini-software suite that uses the dataset to train neural networks to recognize the state of a device and differentiate between states in experimental data. This work gives the definitive reference for the new dataset that will help enable researchers to use it in their experiments or to develop new machine learning approaches and concepts."
https://openalex.org/W2895959315,"Shallow-water hydrothermal vent ecosystems are distinct from the deep-sea counterparts, because they are in receipt of sustenance from both chemosynthetic and photosynthetic production and have a lack of symbiosis. The trophic linkage and energy flow in these ecosystems, however remain elusive, which allows us poor understanding of the whole spectrum of biological components distributed across such environmental gradients. In this study, a thorough isotopic survey was conducted on various biological specimens and suspended particulates collected along four transects across the venting features of a shallow-water hydrothermal field off Kueishan Island, Taiwan. The isotope data combined with a Bayesian-based mixing model indicate that the vent-associated particulate organic matter (vent POM), as primary contribution of chemoautotrophic populations, has a high δ13C value (−18.2 ± 1.1‰) and a low δ15N value (−1.7 ± 0.4‰). Zooplankton and epibenthic crustaceans, as the fundamental consumers, exhibit δ13C and δ15N values ranging from −21.3 to −19.8‰ and +5.1 to +7.5‰, respectively, and can utilize the vent POM for 38–53% of their diets. The vent-obligate crab Xenograpsus testudinatus shows a large variation in δ13C (from −18.8 to −13.9‰) and δ15N values (from 1.1 to 9.8‰), although an omnivorous trophic level (2.5) is identified for it using δ15N values of amino acids, and it can utilize the vent POM for 6–87% of its diet. The consistently low (< 10.0‰) and overlapping δ15N values for most of the analyzed macroinvertebrates suggest extensive ingestion of chemosynthetic production complementing the photosynthetic production, a weak prey–predator relationship and low trophic complexity possibly imposed by the extreme environmental contexts of shallow-water hydrothermal ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2897326694,"Diabetes mellitus causes secondary osteoporosis and muscle atrophy. The ability of alfacalcidol (ALF) and exercise (Exe) to inhibit osteoporosis and muscle atrophy in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) model rats was examined. Twenty-week-old Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats were randomized to ALF (orally 0.1 μg/kg/day), Exe (treadmill exercise at 10 m/min, 60 min/day, 5 days/week), Comb (ALF and Exe), and Cont (T2DM control treated with vehicle and no exercise) groups (n = 8-10 per group). Sedentary Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka rats were used as a non-hyperphagic control. After treatment for 2 or 6 weeks, blood glucose (BG) levels, cross-sectional area (CSA) of tibialis anterior muscle fibers, femoral bone mineral density (BMD), and relative quantities of muscle anabolic markers (Pax7, MyoD, and myogenin) and catabolic markers (Atrogin-1, MuRF1, and REDD1) of the soleus muscle assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were measured. Exe and Comb treatments for 6 weeks decreased BG levels compared with those of the Cont group. ALF, Exe, and Comb treatments for 2 and 6 weeks recovered the CSA compared with that of the Cont group. ALF and Comb treatments for 6 weeks increased femoral BMDs compared with those of the Cont group. After 2 weeks of treatment, Comb treatment increased MyoD expression and decreased MuRF1 expression. ALF or Exe monotherapy significantly decreased Atrogin-1 or MuRF1 expression after 2 weeks of treatment, respectively. After 6 weeks of treatment, ALF and Comb treatments decreased Atrogin-1 and REDD1. These results demonstrate that a combination of ALF and Exe improved CSA from the early phase of treatment by stimulating skeletal muscle differentiation and suppressing muscle catabolic genes. Improvements in BG, BMD, and CSA were observed as long-term effects of the combination therapy. Continued suppression of muscle catabolic genes was observed as a background to these effects."

Sophisticated regulatory circuits are needed to avoid inappropriate immune responses and inflammation. GPR108 is a seven-transmembrane family protein that activates NF-κB strongly when overexpressed. Surprisingly, its action in a physiological context is that of an antagonist of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated signaling. Cells from Gpr108-null mice exhibit enhanced cytokine secretion and NF-κB and IRF3 signaling, whereas Gpr108-null macrophages reconstituted with GPR108 exhibit blunted signaling. Co-expression of TLRs and GPR108 reduces NF-κB and IFNβ promoter activation compared to expression of either TLRs or GPR108 alone. Upon TLR stimulation GPR108 abundance increases and the protein engages TLRs and their partners to reduce MyD88 expression and interfere with its binding to TLR4 through blocking MyD88 ubiquitination. In turn GPR108 is antagonized by TIRAP, an adaptor protein for TLR and MyD88. The interrelationships between GPR108 and innate immune signaling components are multifactorial and point to a membrane-associated signaling structure of significant complexity."
https://openalex.org/W2897392414,"The wide functionality and the vast range of attributes offered by smartphones has led to a substantial increase in the average amount of time these devices are used per day. An excessive use of these tools has been shown to result in symptomatology similar to psychological disorders caused by substance addiction. In Spain, smartphone use has risen exponentially but the effects of this increase remain unclear. Therefore, an instrument is required to help determine the extent of smartphone addiction in the Spanish population. The Smartphone Addiction Inventory (SPAI) is a valid and reliable mean to identify and measure smartphone addiction and so, the aim of this research is the translation and adaptation of SPAI to Spanish, as well as the analysis of its psychometric properties in a Spanish adult population of 2,958 adults, at the University of Valencia. A multiphase-interactive model has been used, based on classical translation–back-translation methods to translate and adapt the SPAI. Moreover, a confirmatory factor analysis to verify that the inventory showed acceptable goodness of fit indices (χ2293 = 4795.909, Comparative Fit Index = 0.927, Tucker–Lewis Index = 0.919, Root Mean Square Error of approximation = 0.072, and Standardised Root Mean square Residual = 0.051) has been carried out. Also good reliability has been found for the global inventory (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.949), and each of its corresponding factors: compulsive behaviour, functional impairment, abstinence, and tolerance (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.856, 0.888, 0.855, and 0.712, respectively). Hence, the SPAI has been adequately translated and adapted for its use in Spain and therefore it is a useful tool for evaluating the degree of smartphone addiction in the Spanish adult population."
https://openalex.org/W2896142858,"Background Self-harm (SH) accounts for over 5% of the workload of emergency ambulance services, and therefore Paramedics are often the first health professional in contact with people who SH. The authors of this paper have reported elsewhere the significant gaps in our understandings which exist surrounding this early care interaction, and some of the challenges paramedics and opportunities in paramedic care for people who SH. This study aimed to explore paramedics’ perceptions of caring for those who SH using Evolved Grounded Theory Methodology. Methods This study took place between 2014–2016 in one UK ambulance service covering a population of three million people. Semi structured interviews were conducted, purposively sampling paramedics until saturation was reached. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded through open, axial, and selective levels of coding, identifying the Basic Social Process (BSP) and developing a Grounded Theory. A second researcher (SH) independently reviewed early results, which were also member-checked with participants. Results Eleven paramedics were interviewed. The following six categories emerged: Context; Judgements and values; Isolation and system failure; Managing risk; Competence at the boundary of mental and physical health needs; Professional, legal and ethical tensions. The BSP Decision making in a context of risk was identified. The final Grounded Theory that emerged was one of ‘Wicked Complexity of paramedic care for people who SH, which includes usual factors such as tiredness and frequent callers, heightened factors including lack of support and pathways, and factors specific to SH such assessing mental health and suicide risk. Conclusions This study builds on a very small body of literature to have explored paramedic care for people who SH and has found that this care interaction provides uniquely complex challenges. The multiple influences within the categories defined in this study need considering conjointly when making improvements to care."
https://openalex.org/W2896166534,"Modeling of neurodegenerative diseases in vitro holds great promise for biomedical research. Human cell lines harboring a mutations in disease-causing genes are thought to recapitulate early stages of the development an inherited disease. Modern genome-editing tools allow researchers to create isogenic cell clones with an identical genetic background providing an adequate “healthy” control for biomedical and pharmacological experiments. Here, we generated isogenic mutant cell clones with 150 CAG repeats in the first exon of the huntingtin (HTT) gene using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and performed ultrastructural and morphometric analyses of the internal organization of the mutant cells. Electron microscopy showed that deletion of three CAG triplets or an HTT gene knockout had no significant influence on the cell structure. The insertion of 150 CAG repeats led to substantial changes in quantitative and morphological parameters of mitochondria and increased the association of mitochondria with the smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum while causing accumulation of small autolysosomes in the cytoplasm. Our data indicate for the first time that expansion of the CAG repeat tract in HTT introduced via the CRISPR/Cas9 technology into a human cell line initiates numerous ultrastructural defects that are typical for Huntington’s disease."

Children with persistent or recurrent fever 36 hours after the end of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are considered to be resistant to treatment and are at increased risk for coronary complications. Although concomitant infection does not affect coronary outcome, it is unknown how it influences the response to IVIG treatment.Retrospective cohort study between 2008 and 2016 in a tertiary pediatric university hospital, including 154 children, of which 59 (38%) had concomitant infection.Children with concomitant infection were more likely to have fever 48 hours after initial IVIG treatment (36% vs 20%, p = 0.05) and to be treated with a second dose (33% vs 18%, p = 0.04). Children with infection had higher C-reactive protein at the time of diagnosis (148 vs 112 mg/L, p = 0.04), and 48 hours after IVIG administration (111 vs 59 mg/L, p = 0.003). Nevertheless, there was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of coronary complications (Z-score > 2.5) between children with and without concomitant infection (36% vs 39%, p = 0.68).Children with KD and concomitant infection are more likely to have persistent fever and elevated inflammatory markers after treatment. This association increases the likelihood of receiving a second dose of IVIG but not the risk of coronary complication. Accordingly, prospective studies to distinguish true IVIG resistance from infection induced persistent fever is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2895785128,"It is still unknown whether there is some deep structure to modern wars and terrorist campaigns that could, for example, enable reliable prediction of future patterns of violent events. Recent war research focuses on size distributions of violent events, with size defined by the number of people killed in each event. Event size distributions within previously available datasets, for both armed conflicts and for global terrorism as a whole, exhibit extraordinary regularities that transcend specifics of time and place. These distributions have been well modelled by a narrow range of power laws that are, in turn, supported by some theories of violent group dynamics. We show that the predicted event-size patterns emerge broadly in a mass of new event data covering all conflicts in the world from 1989 to 2016. Moreover, there are similar regularities in the events generated by individual terrorist organizations, 1998—2016. The existence of such robust empirical patterns hints at the predictability of size distributions of violent events in future wars. We pursue this prospect using split-sample techniques that help us to make useful out-of-sample predictions. Power-law-based prediction systems outperform lognormal-based systems. We conclude that there is indeed evidence from the existing data that fundamental patterns do exist, and that these can allow prediction of size distribution of events in modern wars and terrorist campaigns."
https://openalex.org/W2896077670,"Telomere length has been associated with risk of several cancers. However, studies of the relationship between telomere length and colorectal cancer risk have been inconsistent. This study examined the relationship between telomere length in normal colon tissue and the prevalence of colorectal adenoma, a precursor to colorectal cancer. This nested case-control study consisted of 85 patients aged 40 to 65 undergoing a screening colonoscopy: 40 cases with adenoma(s) detected at colonoscopy and 45 controls with normal colonoscopy. During the colonoscopy, two pinch biopsies of healthy, normal appearing mucosa were obtained from the descending colon. Relative telomere length (rTL) was quantified in DNA extracted from colon mucosa using quantitative real-time PCR. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between telomere length and adenoma prevalence and estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. rTL was significantly longer in colon tissue of individuals with adenomas compared to healthy individuals (p = 0.008). When rTL was categorized into quartiles according to the distribution of rTL among controls, individuals with the longest telomeres had increased odds of adenoma when compared to individuals with shortest telomeres (OR = 4.58, 95% CI: 1.19, 17.7). This study suggests that long telomeres in normal colon tissue are associated with increased colorectal cancer risk."

https://openalex.org/W2896473891,"The Lesser Sunda Islands in eastern Indonesia cover a longitudinal distance of some 600 kilometres. They are the westernmost place where languages of the Austronesian family come into contact with a family of Papuan languages and constitute an area of high linguistic diversity. Despite its diversity, the Lesser Sundas are little studied and for most of the region, written historical records, as well as archaeological and ethnographic data are lacking. In such circumstances the study of relationships between languages through their lexicon is a unique tool for making inferences about human (pre-)history and tracing population movements. However, the lack of a collective body of lexical data has severely limited our understanding of the history of the languages and peoples in the Lesser Sundas. The LexiRumah database fills this gap by assembling lexicons of Lesser Sunda languages from published and unpublished sources, and making those lexicons available online in a consistent format. This database makes it possible for researchers to explore the linguistic data collated from different primary sources, to formulate hypotheses on how the languages of the two families might be internally related and to compare competing hypotheses about subgroupings and language contact in the region. In this article, we present observations from aggregating lexical data from sources of different type and quality, including fieldwork, and generalize our lessons learned towards practical guidelines for creating a consistent database of comparable lexical items, derived from the design and development of LexiRumah. Databases like this are instrumental in developing theories of language evolution and change in understudied regions where small-scale, pre-industrial, pre-literate societies are the majority. It is therefore vital to follow reliable design choices when creating such databases, as described in this paper."
https://openalex.org/W2896434982,"Objectives Sufentanil has been widely used in epidural PCA, while its use in intravenous PCA has rarely been reported. Based on its use in target controlled infusion, we reckoned that the effect-site concentration of sufentanil would be steady if background infusion is given in intravenous PCA. This prospective, single center, randomized study with a three arm parallel group design aims to find out the appropriate dose of sufentanil when used in intravenous PCA with background infusion in abdominal surgeries. Methods Patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancer and consented to the study were recruited. The analgesia pump with one of three different doses of sufentanil (1.5, 2.0 or 2.5 μg/kg) was attached to the patient through peripheral venous line right after surgery. The primary endpoint was pain scale VAS up to 48 hours postoperatively. Results In our study 90 patients were analyzed. In group B (SF 2.0) and C (SF2.5), patients had better pain relief than in group A (SF 1.5). There was no difference between group B and C in pain intensity at rest. While in group C more patients got pain relived at activity than in group B. All three groups had low and similar incidence of adverse effects of sufentanil. Conclusion The dose 2.5 μg/kg of sufentanil with background infusion is preferred because of better pain alleviation at activity without increase of adverse effects up to 48 hours after surgery."

This ‘relative age effect’ has also been demonstrated for special educational needs, learning difficulties, being bullied, and so on. The current study investigated the relationship between relative age of pupils in primary education and teachers’ perception of their behavior. The study sample included 1973 pupils, aged between 6 and 12. Six linear mixed models were carried out with birth day in a year as predictor variable and ‘total problem score’, ‘problems with hyperactivity’, ‘behavioral problems’, ‘emotional problems’, ‘problems with peers’ and ‘pro-social behavior’ as dependent variables. Random intercepts were added for school and teacher level. Cluster-mean centering disaggregated between-school effects and within-school effects. We found no associations between relative age of pupils and teacher perceptions of their behavior. Several explanations are postulated to account for these findings which contradict prior studies on relative age effects."

This study presents the results of finite element analyses on subway tunnels installed in normally consolidated clay deposits subjected to far-field ground motions. The clay strata were modelled by a hyperbolic-hysteretic constitutive model. The influences of three factors on the seismic response of the clay-tunnel systems were examined, namely ground motion intensity, tunnel wall thickness and clay stiffness. Furthermore, the computed racking deformations of the tunnel were compared with several analytical estimations from the literature, and the relationship between racking ratio and flexibility ratio for rectangular tunnels installed in normally consolidated clay deposits was proposed. The findings may provide a useful reference for practical seismic design of tunnels."
https://openalex.org/W2897743241,"In families at risk from monogenic diseases affected offspring, it is fundamental the development of a suitable Double Factor Preimplantation Genetic Testing (DF-PGT) method for both single-gene analysis and chromosome complement screening. Aneuploidy is not only a major issue in advanced-maternal-age patients and balanced translocation carriers, but also the aneuploidy rate is extremely high in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF), even in young donors. To adequate NGS technology to the DF-PGT strategy four different whole genome amplification systems (Sureplex, MALBAC, and two multiple displacement amplification systems-MDA) were tested using TruSight One panel on cell lines and blastocyst trophectoderm biopsies-TE. Embryo cytogenetic status was analyzed by Nexus software. Sureplex and MALBAC DNA products were considered not suitable for PGT diagnosis due to inconsistent and poor results on Trusight one (TSO) panel. Results obtained with both MDA based methods (GEH-MDA and RG-MDA) were appropriate for direct mutation detection by TSO NGS platform. Nevertheless, RG-MDA amplification products showed better coverage and lower ADO rates than GEH-MDA. The present work also demonstrates that the same TSO sequencing data is suitable not only for the direct mutation detection, but also for the indirect mutation detection by linkage analysis of informative SNPs. The present work also demonstrates that Nexus software is competent for the detection of CNV by using with TSO sequencing data from RG-MDA products, allowing for the whole cytogenetic characterization of the embryos. In conclusion, successfully development of an innovative and promising DF-PGT strategy using TSO-NGS technology in TE biopsies, performed in-house in a single laboratory experience, has been done in the present work. Additional studies should be performed before it could be used as a diagnostic alternative in order to validate this approach for the detection of chromosomal aneuploidies."
https://openalex.org/W2895998206,"Japan experienced a nationwide rubella epidemic from 2012 to 2013, mostly in urban prefectures with large population sizes. The present study aimed to capture the spatiotemporal patterns of rubella using a parsimonious metapopulation epidemic model and examine the potential usefulness of spatial vaccination.A metapopulation epidemic model in discrete time and space was devised and applied to rubella notification data from 2012 to 2013. Employing a piecewise constant model for the linear growth rate in six different time periods, and using the particle Markov chain Monte Carlo method, the effective reproduction numbers were estimated at 1.37 (95% CrI: 1.12, 1.77) and 1.37 (95% CrI: 1.24, 1.48) in Tokyo and Osaka groups, respectively, during the growing phase of the epidemic in 2013. The rubella epidemic in 2012 involved substantial uncertainties in its parameter estimates and forecasts. We examined multiple scenarios of spatial vaccination with coverages of 1%, 3% and 5% for all of Japan to be distributed in different combinations of prefectures. Scenarios indicated that vaccinating the top six populous urban prefectures (i.e., Tokyo, Kanagawa, Osaka, Aichi, Saitama and Chiba) could potentially be more effective than random allocation. However, greater uncertainty was introduced by stochasticity and initial conditions such as the number of infectious individuals and the fraction of susceptibles.While the forecast in 2012 was accompanied by broad uncertainties, a narrower uncertainty bound of parameters and reliable forecast were achieved during the greater rubella epidemic in 2013. By better capturing the underlying epidemic dynamics, spatial vaccination could substantially outperform the random vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2896292052,"Introduction Members of the adipokine family such as resistin, adiponectin and omentin have recently been described as novel biomarkers with a diagnostic and prognostic role in the context of critically ill patients during intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. Kisspeptin represent another member of this family and has been shown to be closely correlated to different members of the adipokine family in manifold diseases. However, its role in critical illness and sepsis is currently unknown. Materials and methods Kisspeptin serum concentrations were measured in 133 ICU patients admitted to the medical ICU. Results were compared with 36 healthy controls. Results Kisspeptin serum levels were elevated in the serum of critically ill patients at admission to the ICU, when compared to healthy controls, and remained increased after 72 hours of ICU treatment. Notably, kisspeptin levels were independent of the presence of sepsis and etiology of critical illness. In line, serum concentrations of kisspeptin were not correlated to concentrations of inflammatory cytokines or established sepsis markers. Serum kisspeptin correlated inversely with the glomerular filtration rate. In contrast to the reported role of other members of the adipokine family, serum levels of kisspeptin were neither predictive for short term survival during ICU treatment nor for patients’ overall survival. Kisspeptin levels did not correlate with other adipokines measured in serum, including leptin, resistin, ghrelin, or adiponectin. Conclusions Although circulating kisspeptin levels were strongly elevated in ICU-patients, elevated kisspeptin levels were not predictive for an impaired patients' survival."
https://openalex.org/W2949074722,"TMEM106B was initially identified as a risk factor for FTLD, but recent studies highlighted its general role in neurodegenerative diseases. Very recently TMEM106B has also been characterized to regulate aging phenotypes. TMEM106B is a 274-residue lysosomal protein whose cytoplasmic domain functions in the endosomal/autophagy pathway by dynamically and transiently interacting with diverse categories of proteins but the underlying structural basis remains completely unknown. Here we conducted bioinformatics analysis and biophysical characterization by CD and NMR spectroscopy, and obtained results reveal that the TMEM106B cytoplasmic domain is intrinsically disordered with no well-defined three-dimensional structure. Nevertheless, detailed analysis of various multi-dimensional NMR spectra allowed defining residue-specific conformations and dynamics. Overall, the TMEM106B cytoplasmic domain is lacking of any tight tertiary packing and relatively flexible. However, several segments are populated with dynamic/nascent secondary structures and have relatively restricted backbone motions on ps-ns time scale, as indicated by their positive {1H}-15N steady-state NOE. Our study thus decodes that being intrinsically disordered may allow the TMEM106B cytoplasmic domain to dynamically and transiently interact with a variety of distinct partners."

Human milk, which closely links the mother with infant, is an important factor to the infant health. Here, we analyzed the colostrum whey proteome of women with or without G-HypoT.Using high-mass accuracy and high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), 1055 proteins were identified. Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) analysis identified differentially expressed proteins between G-HypoT and non-G-HypoT mothers. Of 44 proteins identified, 15 proteins were significantly increased in G-HypoT colostrum whey, while 29 were significantly decreased. Analysis revealed that enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, and that reflect the metabolic activities in breastfeeding women, including fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase 1, phosphoglycerate mutase 1 were down-regulated. Cell structural proteins, biomarkers of mammary integrity development, including Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and actin were lower in G-HypoT colostrum whey. However, immune protein fragments like Ig gamma-3 chain C region increased in G-HypoT colostrum whey.These results implied that G-HypoT may changed human colostrum whey protein in composition level, decreasing levels of metabolic proteins and cell-structure proteins, while increasing levels of immune-related proteins, which may compromise or reflect mothers' and infants' health."

The Blue-fronted Amazon (Amazona aestiva) is the most traded parrot worldwide and suffers from poaching and habitat loss. Many species of parrots, including the Blue-fronted Amazon, form communal roosts where they spend the night. Under certain circumstances, roost surveys can be a rapid and cost-effective way to obtain information about the demography of parrots or the consequences of threats. We surveyed an area of 2,700 km2 in a large wetland in mid-western of Brazil and located five Blue-fronted Amazon roosts. We conducted monthly counts of the birds arriving at these roosts for 28–61 months and stratified the counts into flock sizes. We used this information to estimate the number of parrots using these roosts to determine whether the roosts follow seasonal patterns and whether they have different flock-size structures and different dynamics throughout the year, as well as to determine the trends of the roosting parrots, which are stratified by flock size. The roosts were different, as they followed different seasonal patterns and had different flock-size structures, which could be interpreted in relation to the parrot breeding cycle. The trends of singletons, which index the number of reproductive couples each year, and the number of pairs parrots increased or fluctuated around a baseline, but the number of fledged young in the year declined throughout the study. This is of concern, as it indicates problems in population recruitment, which could have been unnoticed by the management authorities, as the total numbers were not decreasing. Although every monitored roost had birds of each age or reproductive condition strata, the fact that the roosts were different could be important in terms of management, as it will be more effective for the conservation of the Blue-fronted Amazon to protect a carefully chosen set of complementary roosts."

We conducted a study to determine the associations of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with laboratory markers of dengue severity and length of hospital stay (LOS). A retrospective study was conducted at a private hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia, from December 2011 to December 2016. Bivariate analysis was performed to analyze the associations of laboratory markers of dengue severity and LOS with the presence or absence of NAFLD in no-plasma-leakage (no leakage) and plasma-leakage (leakage) groups. There were 267 dengue-infected patients included in this study. Of these patients, 115 (43.1%) were classified as belonging to the no leakage group, and 152 (56.9%) were classified as belonging to the leakage group. Of the 115 patients belonging to the no leakage group, 53 (46.1%) did not have NAFLD, and 62 (53.9%) had NAFLD. Of the 152 patients belonging to the leakage group, 85 (55.9%) did not have NAFLD, and 67 (44.1%) had NAFLD. Leakage group patients with NAFLD experienced significantly higher hemoconcentration severity (p = 0.04), lower platelet count (p = 0.004) and higher LOS (p = 0.042) than did leakage group patients without NAFLD. The presence of NAFLD in dengue-infected patients with plasma leakage was associated with more severe hemoconcentration, thrombocytopenia and prolonged hospital stay."

This knowledge is especially important for the control of Desmodus rotundus population as it is a transmitter of rabies virus. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the functional activity of testis and epididymis of D. rotundus in dry and rainy seasons under a morphological approach. We observed an increase in tubular diameter and epithelial height of the seminiferous tubules during the rainy season. In the latter, additionally, stereological analysis of the testis showed increased proportion of seminiferous epithelium and reduced percentage of lumen. The sperm number in caput/corpus epididymis increased in rainy season, whereas sperm count and transit time were reduced in cauda region. These alterations were probably related to the recovery of epithelium activities after mating season in dry season. Despite altered nuclear and cytoplasm parameters of Leydig cells between seasons, the volume and number of these cells were constant. Moreover, no change in serum testosterone levels, daily sperm production, and apoptotic index were observed, which indicates that the reproductive pattern in D. rotundus does not change between seasons. Our study offers a baseline for the management of vampire bat population as an attempt to control rabies disease."

This species was brought into cultivation by Māori within the last 700–800 years for its edible roots and was transplanted beyond its natural distribution as part of its cultivation. We found very high levels of genetic structuring in the natural populations (FST = 0.84), indicating low levels of gene flow. Reduced genetic diversity was found in the translocated populations, suggesting a large loss of genetic diversity early in the domestication process. The data indicates that rengarenga was brought into cultivation independently at least three times, with the sources of these introductions located within a narrow area encompassing about 250km of coastline. Hybridization was inferred between A. cirratum and the closely related A. bifurcatum, despite A. birfucatum not occurring in the vicinity."

In total, data of 3,776 workers from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey VI were examined. The workers' working hours per week, daily near work time, and complaints of perceived stress were analyzed in conjunction with other sociodemographic and occupation-related variables. Multivariate logistic analysis found that workers with 3 and ≥4 hours of near work were more likely to report high perceived stress than were the reference group who had <1 hour per day of near work, with odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of 1.34 (1.01-1.78) and 1.94 (1.53-2.46), respectively. Additionally, those working 50 and more hours a week were more likely to report high perceived stress with ORs of 1.51 (1.19-1.90) and 1.88 (1.42-2.48), respectively. When stratified by working hours, workers with daily near work time of ≥4 hours were more likely to report high perceived stress with ORs of 2.21 (1.45-3.37), 2.27 (1.30-3.97), and 3.47 (1.80-6.69), among the workers with 40-49, 50-59, and ≥60 weekly working hours, respectively. Workers with greater near work time are at risk for high perceived stress. Moreover, this risk was found to be higher among workers with longer working hours.

This paper utilizes the Markov model to describe transition probability matrixes of economic states for the separation of economic cycles. We develop a new model, which we term the Markov rating shopping dual reputation model, incorporating two reputation effects. This model is well suited to analyze the conditions of the dual rating incentive regulation and the constraint regulation for preventing rating inflation in collusion among credit rating agencies. Then, we apply the Markov regime switching-vector auto-regression (MS-VAR) to estimate the transition probability matrixes of America, England, Japan and China. Based on the numerical analysis and the simulations, the results show that a dual rating regulation can prevent the collusion of inflated ratings, as well as increased rating fees with the separation of economic cycles; additionally, when separating the economic cycles, a constraint regulation is more effective at reducing the risk of rating inflation in collusion and regulatory cost."
https://openalex.org/W2897820445,"Introduction Retention of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose 18F-FDG in the bladder causes more problems in small animal research than in human research owing to the smaller size of the subject. Catheterization has been proposed to reduce bladder spillover both in human studies and in small animal research. Noninvasive alternatives such as hydration plus furosemide also seem to be a promising pre-imaging strategy for decreasing bladder spillover. Our main goal was to measure the effects of the combination of furosemide and hydration for reducing bladder signal directly on mouse bowel 18F-FDG-PET images. Methods Nine mice were divided into two groups: the control group (C, n = 4) and the treatment group (n = 5). The clearance protocol combines hyperhydration and a single furosemide dose during the 18F-FDG uptake period. Two images were acquired on different days in treated mice to evaluate two different furosemide doses (low dose, LD, 3.5 mg/kg; and high dose, HD, 7 mg/kg). A region of interest was drawn on each computed tomography image (bladder, kidneys, liver, muscle, and bone marrow). To quantify bladder spillover, two different areas of the colon were selected. Results A remarkable reduction in bladder spillover was achieved on 18F-FDG -PET in both groups. Our imaging findings were quantified, and both furosemide doses induced a decrease in mean standard uptake values (SUVmean) compared with the controls (LD 1.46 ± 0.54 and HD 1.05 ± 0.29; controls: 8.90 ± 3.4 [p-value < 0.05]). Conclusion We validated a non-invasive, easy, and harmless pre-imaging alternative for decreasing 18F-FDG bladder spillover. Our study shows the effect of furosemide on bladder spillover directly on 18F-FDG-PET images by measuring SUVmean in the bladder, colon, liver, muscle, and bone marrow."
https://openalex.org/W2897877415,"We develop a Bayesian hierarchical log5 model to predict the probability of a particular batter/pitcher matchup event in baseball by extending the log5 model which is widely used for describing matchup events. The log5 model is simple and intuitive with fixed coefficients but less flexible than the generalized log5 model that allows the estimation of coefficients using data. Meanwhile, although the generalized log5 model is more flexible, the estimation of coefficients often suffers from a lack of data as a large sample of previous outcomes for a particular batter/pitcher matchup is rarely available in practice. The proposed Bayesian hierarchical log5 model retains the advantages of both models while complementing their disadvantages by estimating the unknown coefficients as in the generalized log5 model, but by using the fixed coefficients of the standard log5 model as prior knowledge. By combining the ideas of the two previous models, the proposed model can estimate the probability of a particular matchup event using a small amount of historical data of the players. Furthermore, we show that the Bayesian hierarchical log5 model achieves better predictive performance than the standard log5 model and the generalized log5 model using a real data example. We further extend the proposed model by including a new variable representing the defensive ability of the pitcher's team and show that the extended model can further improve the predictive performance of the Bayesian hierarchical log5 model."
https://openalex.org/W2895933266,"In sports, success and failure are believed to be contagious. Yet it is unclear what might cause contagion. This study investigated whether motor contagion is associated with the active observation of the kinematic actions of others. In Experiment 1, six skilled hammer throwers threw a hammer after watching a video of a model throwing toward the left, center, or right. The video included two types of action kinematics which resulted in throw directions that were either easy or difficult to predict based on the model's kinematics. In Experiment 2, the athletes threw hammers after watching the same stimuli as Experiment 1, but while engaging in one of two types of focus (self-focus or non-self-focus) to determine whether motor contagion could be diminished. Results demonstrated that the direction of each participant's throw was more influenced by the videos that contained easy action kinematics, supporting a critical role for the meaningfulness of the link between an action and its outcome in producing motor contagion. Motion analysis revealed that motor contagion was not likely to be a result of the observer imitating the model's action kinematics. The contagion observed in Experiment 1 disappeared when participants engaged in self-focus. These results suggest that motor contagion is influenced by the predictability of an action outcome when observing an action, and that motor contagion can be inhibited through self-focus when observing."

However, an understanding of the roles of these proteins in cancer metastasis and physiological processes has been limited by the difficulty of obtaining specific antibodies against these highly conserved membrane-associated proteins. To facilitate research into the biological functions of supervillin, monoclonal antibodies were generated against the bacterially expressed human supervillin N-terminus. Two chimeric monoclonal antibodies with rabbit Fc domains (clones 1E2/CPTC-SVIL-1; 4A8/CPTC-SVIL-2) and two mouse monoclonal antibodies (clones 5A8/CPTC-SVIL-3; 5G3/CPTC-SVIL-4) were characterized with respect to their binding sites, affinities, and for efficacy in immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemical staining. Two antibodies (1E2, 5G3) recognize a sequence found only in primate supervillins, whereas the other two antibodies (4A8, 5A8) are specific for a more broadly conserved conformational epitope(s). All antibodies function in immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation and in immunofluorescence microscopy under the fixation conditions identified here. We also show that the 5A8 antibody works on immunohistological sections. These antibodies should provide useful tools for the study of mammalian supervillins."
https://openalex.org/W2896280374,"Recent years have witnessed greater involvement of European Union (EU) organisations in health communication campaigns that address chronic diseases and that are designed for implementation in multiple countries. This development raises challenges inherent in adapting the design of public health communication campaigns to multi-national settings. This article provides a first exploratory investigation of these challenges and how to address them based on data gathered from four expert focus groups, each concentrated on a common risk factor for chronic disease: smoking, alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyle. Despite the exploratory nature of the data, it was possible to identify several common key challenges: variation in behaviours, social and cultural norms, and issues related to language and communication channels, the divide between EU stakeholders and local actors, and differences in national legislation and available resources. Two risk factor-specific challenges were also identified: effective messaging for complex issues (unhealthy diet) and the involvement of industry representatives (smoking, sedentary lifestyle). We propose conceiving of cross-national communication campaigns as providing a common blueprint and structure that can inform and support the development of differentiated yet harmonised local campaigns."
https://openalex.org/W2897302403,"Pathogenic mutations in the Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor gene (LDLR) cause Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH), one of the most common genetic disorders with a prevalence as high as 1 in 200 in some populations. FH is an autosomal dominant disorder of lipoprotein metabolism characterized by high blood cholesterol levels, deposits of cholesterol in peripheral tissues such as tendon xanthomas and accelerated atherosclerosis. To date, 2500 LDLR variants have been identified in the LDLR gene; however, only a minority of them have been experimentally characterized and proven to be pathogenic. Here we investigated the role of Cys46 located in the first repeat of the LDL receptor binding domain in recognition of apolipoproteins.Activity of the p.(Cys46Gly) LDLR variant was assessed by immunoblotting and flow cytometry in CHO-ldlA7 expressing the receptor variant. Affinity of p.(Cys46Gly) for LDL and VLDL was determined by solid-phase immunoassays and in silico analysis was used to predict mutation effects.Functional characterization of p.(Cys46Gly) LDLR variant showed impaired LDL and VLDL binding and uptake activity. Consistent with this, solid-phase immunoassays showed the p.(Cys46Gly) LDLR variant has decreased binding affinity for apolipoproteins. These results indicate the important role of Cys46 in LDL receptor activity and highlight the role of LR1 in LDLr activity modulation. This study reinforces the significance of in vitro functional characterization of LDL receptor activity in developing an accurate approach to FH genetic diagnosis. This is of particular importance because it enables clinicians to tailor personalized treatments for patients' mutation profile."
