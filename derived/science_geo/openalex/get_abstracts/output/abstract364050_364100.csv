Here, we expand upon the classic hallmarks to include the stress phenotypes of tumorigenesis. We describe a conceptual framework of how oncogene and non-oncogene addictions contribute to these hallmarks and how they can be exploited through stress sensitization and stress overload to selectively kill cancer cells. In particular, we present evidence for a large class of non-oncogenes that are essential for cancer cell survival and present attractive drug targets. Finally, we discuss the path ahead to therapeutic discovery and provide theoretical considerations for combining orthogonal cancer therapies."

However, the use of viruses encoding the reprogramming factors represents a major limitation of the current technology since even low vector expression may alter the differentiation potential of the iPSCs or induce malignant transformation. Here, we show that fibroblasts from five patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease can be efficiently reprogrammed and subsequently differentiated into dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, we derived hiPSCs free of reprogramming factors using Cre-recombinase excisable viruses. Factor-free hiPSCs maintain a pluripotent state and show a global gene expression profile, more closely related to hESCs than to hiPSCs carrying the transgenes. Our results indicate that residual transgene expression in virus-carrying hiPSCs can affect their molecular characteristics and that factor-free hiPSCs therefore represent a more suitable source of cells for modeling of human disease."

By drug efflux, the ABCG2 transporter provides chemoresistance in stem cells and contributes to the blood brain barrier (BBB) when active in endothelial cells. We investigated the SP phenotype of mouse and human gliomas. In glioma endothelial cells, ABC transporter function is impaired, corresponding to disruption of the BBB in these tumors. By contrast, the SP phenotype is increased in nonendothelial cells that form neurospheres and are highly tumorigenic. In this cell population, Akt, but not its downstream target mTOR, regulates ABCG2 activity, and loss of PTEN increases the SP. This Akt-induced ABCG2 activation results from its transport to the plasma membrane. Temozolomide, the standard treatment of gliomas, although not an ABCG2 substrate, increases the SP in glioma cells, especially in cells missing PTEN.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most prevalent and aggressive form of primary brain tumor. The infiltrative growth of glioma cells and their resistance to standard therapy have limited the development of successful treatment. In recent years, numerous studies have reported the presence of stem cells in solid tumors referred to as cancer stem-like cells (Regenbrecht et al., 2008Regenbrecht C.R. Lehrach H. Adjaye J. Stemming Cancer: Functional Genomics of Cancer Stem Cells in Solid Tumors.Stem Cell Rev. 2008; 4: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, Yuan et al., 2004Yuan X. Curtin J. Xiong Y. Liu G.

Cancer stem-like cells represent a population of drug-resistant cells that can survive treatment and repopulate the tumor. These data led to new paradigms of tumorogenesis and chemotherapy focusing on tumor initiation and resistance of cancer stem-like cells to chemotherapeutic agents and radiation (Hambardzumyan et al., 2008aHambardzumyan D. Becher O.J. Holland E.C. Cancer stem cells and survival pathways.Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The underlying mechanisms for such resistance have been attributed to their greater capacity for DNA-damage repair, activation of survival pathways (Bao et al., 2006Bao S. Wu Q. McLendon R.E. Hao Y. Shi Q. Hjelmeland A.B. Dewhirst M.W. Bigner D.D. Rich J.N.

PI3K pathway regulates survival of cancer stem cells residing in the perivascular niche following radiation in medulloblastoma in vivo.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), and overexpression of ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporter) (Dean et al., 2005Dean M. Fojo T. Bates S. Tumour stem cells and drug resistance.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (2856) Google Scholar). ABC transporters belong to a superfamily of membrane pumps that use ATP hydrolysis to efflux various endogenous compounds and xenobiotics from the cell (Szakacs et al., 2006Szakacs G. Paterson J.K. Ludwig J.A. Booth-Genthe C. Gottesman M.M. Targeting multidrug resistance in cancer.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 219-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2667) Google Scholar). These proteins participate in tumor resistance by actively transporting drugs across the cell membrane, serving to protect cells from chemotherapeutic agents (Donnenberg and Donnenberg, 2005Donnenberg V.S. Donnenberg A.D. Multiple drug resistance in cancer revisited: the cancer stem cell hypothesis.J. Clin. Pharmacol. 2005; 45: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). ABCB1, ABCC1, and ABCG2 are the three main multidrug-resistance genes overexpressed in multiple cancers. In addition to the efflux of drugs, these pumps also possess the ability to exclude fluorescent dyes, such as the Hoechst 33342. Stem cells are frequently identified as the “side population” (SP) by flow cytometry based on ABCG2-mediated efflux of Hoechst dye (Goodell et al., 1996Goodell M.A. Brose K. Paradis G. Conner A.S. Mulligan R.C. Isolation and functional properties of murine hematopoietic stem cells that are replicating in vivo.J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1797-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar). Stem cells can be isolated by FACS sorting to select cells that exhibit low level of Hoechst fluorescence intensity. SP cells were first isolated from bone marrow and more recently from various solid tumors and cell lines (Wu and Alman, 2008Wu C. Alman B.A. Side population cells in human cancers.Cancer Lett. 2008; 268: 1-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These cells are pluripotent and have greater growth capacity and resistance to cytotoxic drugs as compared to non-SP cells (Hirschmann-Jax et al., 2004Hirschmann-Jax C. Foster A.E. Wulf G.G. Nuchtern J.G. Jax T.W. Gobel U. Goodell M.A. Brenner M.K. A distinct “side population” of cells with high drug efflux capacity in human tumor cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 14228-14233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). Moreover, when isolated from solid tumors, SP cells are more tumorigenic after injection into nude mice (Ho et al., 2007Ho M.M. Ng A.V. Lam S. Hung J.Y. Side population in human lung cancer cell lines and tumors is enriched with stem-like cancer cells.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4827-4833Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, Patrawala et al., 2005Patrawala L. Calhoun T. Schneider-Broussard R. Zhou J. Claypool K. Tang D.G. Side population is enriched in tumorigenic, stem-like cancer cells, whereas ABCG2+ and ABCG2- cancer cells are similarly tumorigenic.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6207-6219Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). In addition to their presence in normal cells and neoplastic stem cells, ABC transporters are even more active in brain endothelial cells, contributing to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and playing a pivotal role in detoxification (Dean et al., 2005Dean M. Fojo T. Bates S. Tumour stem cells and drug resistance.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (2856) Google Scholar). This biological activity is critical with regard to treatment of brain tumor patients where drug penetration into the brain is limited by ABC transporter function in endothelial cells. Chemotherapy efficacy is further limited by ABCG2 expression in the cancer stem-like cells population that presumably repopulates the tumor after therapy (Robey et al., 2007Robey R.W. Polgar O. Deeken J. To K.W. Bates S.E. ABCG2: determining its relevance in clinical drug resistance.Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 39-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Although much is known about the SP phenotype and ABC function in stem cells, several key questions remain unanswered regarding the role of ABCG2 in glioma biology. For example, what role does ABCG2 function have in the loss of BBB integrity in malignant gliomas? How do genomic alterations associated with glioma progression, such as loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN, and therapeutic events in glioma treatment with drugs, such as temozolomide, regulate ABCG2 function in cancer stem-like cells? Further, can the SP phenotype and ABCG2 activity be used as a marker for stem-like cells in gliomas, and how do genomic and therapeutic events modify its function? Finally, can these issues be modeled in mice? In order to investigate the role of ABCG2 function in the glioma BBB and glioma cancer stem-like cells, we chose a well-characterized mouse model for glioma. We used PDGF-induced gliomas generated by the RCAS-tv-a system (Shih et al., 2004Shih A.H. Dai C. Hu X. Rosenblum M.K. Koutcher J.A. Holland E.C. Dose-dependent effects of platelet-derived growth factor-B on glial tumorigenesis.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4783-4789Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) where concomitant deletion of PTEN can be achieved by delivery of the RCAS-Cre virus (Hu et al., 2005Hu X. Pandolfi P.P. Li Y. Koutcher J.A. Rosenblum M. Holland E.C. mTOR promotes survival and astrocytic characteristics induced by Pten/AKT signaling in glioblastoma.Neoplasia. 2005; 7: 356-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In this study, we extend previous findings linking the stem cell properties of the side population and ABCG2 function to glioblastoma mouse models. We confirm the high tumorigenicity of SP cells, their self-renewal ability, and their resistance to chemotherapy. We also verify that the SP phenotype, which results from ABCG2 activity, is a stem cell marker for glioma cells. We show that regulation of ABCG2 function and localization to the plasma membrane are achieved by Akt. In the present study of gliomas in vivo, we found loss of ABC transporter function in glioma endothelial cells, correlating with the loss of the BBB integrity seen in glioma patients. Further, we provide the first evidence that loss of PTEN increases the SP phenotype of glioma cancer stem-like cells. In addition, temozolomide increases the SP fraction, especially in cells lacking PTEN. We show that temozolomide, while not a substrate for ABCG2, enriches the fraction of glioma cells with stem-like characteristics and elevated O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression. Finally, we report a more detailed mechanism of ABCG2 regulation: the PI3K/Akt pathway, but not the downstream target of Akt mTOR, specifically modulates the transporter's activity and also extend these observations to human cancer stem-like cells. The expression of ABC transporters at the BBB has been proposed as the major factor limiting drug penetration inside the brain with the consequent multidrug resistance of tumors. We initially used immunofluorescence staining of tissue samples to determine the location of ABCG2 expression in normal mouse brain and in brains harboring PDGF-induced gliomas. Consistent with previous reports, immunohistochemical analyses of normal brain sections revealed strong ABCG2 expression at the luminal side of capillary endothelial cells. Such immunoreactive cells were distributed throughout the brain, including the cortex, white matter tract, and cerebellum (see Figure S1A available online). In PDGF-induced glioma, ABCG2 localized to the large vessels of the tumor where it coexpressed with the endothelial cell marker Von Willebrand factor (vWF) (Figure 1A). Flow cytometry analysis for ABCG2 function usually identifies the side population as a very small fraction of cells in tumors; consistent with this, we found a small percentage of tumor cells expressing ABCG2. However, tumor samples exhibited some regions of cells positive for both ABCG2 and nestin, which were not endothelial cells (negative for vWF) (Figure 1B). These observations suggested that both endothelial cells and progenitor tumor cells express ABCG2. To characterize the cells that actively contribute to the SP phenotype, we performed a Hoechst dye exclusion assay on cells isolated from the normal brain cortex of five different mice, as well as cells isolated from PDGF-induced tumors. As most cells accumulate Hoechst 33342, SP cells can be isolated by dual-wavelength flow cytometry based of their ability to efflux this dye, a process that requires the action of the ABC transporters. We identified a side population among cells isolated from normal mouse brain cortex (Figure 1C). This SP fraction was generally small, ranging from 0.5% to 0.8% of total cells, and was accompanied by a distinct population of cells termed the “low side population” (low SP). Low SP cells were present in large numbers (c.a 6% to 8%) and very actively excluded Hoechst 33342. Incubation in the presence of 100 μM verapamil, known to block ABC transporter activity, abolished the low SP and part of the SP. In contrast to what was seen with normal brain tissue, cells isolated from solid tumor exhibited a different pattern of Hoechst dye exclusion, with a uniform SP representing 4% to 8% of the total population (Figure 1C). While a low SP has already been described in normal brain, its relative absence in the tumor samples was unexpected (Mouthon et al., 2006Mouthon M.A. Fouchet P. Mathieu C. Sii-Felice K. Etienne O. Lages C.S. Boussin F.D. Neural stem cells from mouse forebrain are contained in a population distinct from the ‘side population’.J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Q-RT-PCR for ABCG2 confirmed the high level of expression of ABCG2 transporter in the low SP and SP, i.e., 30- and 10-fold increases, respectively, as compared to the main population (MP), confirming that ABCG2 contributes to the SP phenotype (Figure 1D). The ABCB1a (MDR1a) transporter was also found to be highly expressed in the low SP and SP fractions, while the level of ABCB1b (MDR1b) and ABCC1 (MRP1) transporters was not elevated in these fractions (Figure S1B). To further characterize the cells present within the SP and low SP, cells isolated from normal mouse brain or PDGF-induced gliomas were subjected to double staining for Hoechst and various cell surface markers. Staining of cells isolated from normal brain cortex for CD31, a marker of endothelial cells, showed that up to 70% of the positive cells are concentrated into the low SP area (Figure 1E). This observation indicates that the low SP is highly enriched in endothelial cells and is consistent with the immunolocalization of ABCG2 at the vasculature described above. As CD133 has been proposed to be a marker of endothelial progenitor cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and neuronal stem cells in normal and malignant tissues, we looked at the expression profile of CD133 within the Hoechst populations. In normal brain, CD133+ cells were located mainly in the low SP, where a high proportion of these cells were also positive for CD31, indicating an endothelial cell origin (Figure 1E). In contrast to the normal brain, where CD31 cells were predominantly found in the low SP, the CD31+ cells in gliomas were spread over the low SP, SP, and MP, implying a reduction of ABC transporter function in the endothelial cells in these tumors. (Figure 1E). The CD133+ cells were more abundant in PDGF-induced gliomas as compare to normal brain (4% ± 1.5 versus 12% ± 3.3) and were also distributed across the three Hoechst populations. Results for quantification of the staining in SP fraction isolated from tumor-bearing mice are presented in Figure 1F. Up to 35% of the cells were endothelial cells (CD31+ and CD31+/CD133+) and 5% were CD133 single positive cells. Finally, 15% of the cells labeled for the oligodendrocyte progenitor marker A2B5, and 4% labeled for the microglia marker CD11b. Based on immunostaining, a majority of tumor cells expressing ABCG2 were also nestin positive. These data further indicate that the SP population of cells is composed of both endothelial cells and cells expressing stem and progenitor markers. Previous reports have documented that the BBB is disrupted in human and animal models of brain tumors resulting in leakage of IV contrast material into tumors (McConville et al., 2007McConville P. Hambardzumyan D. Moody J.B. Leopold W.R. Kreger A.R. Woolliscroft M.J. Rehemtulla A. Ross B.D. Holland E.C. Magnetic resonance imaging determination of tumor grade and early response to temozolomide in a genetically engineered mouse model of glioma.Clin. Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 2897-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, Provenzale et al., 2005Provenzale J.M. Mukundan S. Dewhirst M. The role of blood-brain barrier permeability in brain tumor imaging and therapeutics.AJR Am. J. Roentgenol. 2005; 185: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In line with this observation, the absence of low SP in cells isolated from solid tumors suggests that their endothelial cells possess lower levels of ABC transporter expression or activity. This is supported by the wide distribution of CD31+ cells among the SP and MP, demonstrating that endothelial cells indeed possess a lower capacity to efflux the Hoechst dye. We then determined the extent that SP cells behave as stem cells. After Hoechst staining, the three populations from four different brains were separated by FACS sorting and equal numbers of cells were cultured in neurosphere medium (supplemented with EGF and bFGF). In all cases, the SP cells from gliomas formed more neurospheres than the MP and low SP cells (Figure 2A). By contrast, none of the three cell populations isolated from adult normal brain cortex contained cells able to form neurospheres. These results indicate the specific presence of cancer stem-like cells within the SP fraction of solid tumors. Since the SP in vivo accounts for a small fraction of the cells and contains a high number of endothelial cells, we used neural stem cell culture to enrich for cancer stem-like cells from mouse gliomas. Cancer stem-like cells cultures were obtained by transferring cells isolated from different PDGF-driven tumors into neurosphere medium. These spheres contained cells that predominantly stained with antibodies to stem cell markers such as nestin, Oct-4, Sox-2, musashi, and also to some level to ABCG2 (Figure 2B). ABCB1, ABCC1, and ABCG2 are the three main transporters known to posses the ability to exclude drugs and to be present in stem cells of different tumor types. Analysis of ABC transporter expression in tumor cells cultured in neurosphere medium, as opposed to DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, showed that ABCG2 is the only transporter upregulated in glioma cancer stem-like cells; the expression of ABCB1a/b and ABCC1 was even reduced (Figure 2C). This observation is consistent with the concept that the ABCG2 transporter is the most specific stem cell marker of this family (Islam et al., 2005Islam M.O. Kanemura Y. Tajria J. Mori H. Kobayashi S. Hara M. Yamasaki M. Okano H. Miyake J. Functional expression of ABCG2 transporter in human neural stem/progenitor cells.Neurosci. Res. 2005; 52: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As the SP represents a high concentration of stem cells, Hoechst dye exclusion of neurospheres was expected to yield a large SP fraction. As expected, 10% to 20% of cells from neurospheres were located in the SP fraction (Figure 2D). There were no CD31-positive cells in neurosphere culture, indicating that the SP phenotype is not due to the presence of endothelial cells (data not shown). Q-RT-PCR confirmed the higher level of ABCG2 expression in the SP fraction (Figure S1C). The relative expression of ABCB1a and ABCC1 was also found to be increased in the SP fraction, which is not surprising given that Hoechst dye is a substrate for various ABC transporters (Figure S1C). We then preincubated neurospheres with fumitremorgin C (FTC), a potent and specific inhibitor of ABCG2 (Rabindran et al., 2000Rabindran S.K. Ross D.D. Doyle L.A. Yang W. Greenberger L.M. Fumitremorgin C reverses multidrug resistance in cells transfected with the breast cancer resistance protein.Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 47-50PubMed Google Scholar), to determine the contribution of ABCG2 to the SP phenotype. Addition of FTC reduced the SP phenotype from 22% to 4%, confirming the dominant role that ABCG2 plays in the SP phenotype (Figure 2D). Pantoprazole, known to block ABCG2 activity (and to a lesser extent ABCB1), also diminished the amount of SP cells to 7% of total cells. Verapamil, a nonspecific inhibitor of ABC transporters (and more potent inhibitor of ABCB1 and ABCC1) only reduced the SP fraction to 11%. We next analyzed the self-renewal capacity of SP cells using the neurosphere-forming assay. Neurospheres cultured from four different PDGF-induced glioma-bearing mice were dissociated and stained with Hoechst. SP and MP cells were then sorted and cultured in neurosphere medium. SP cells from neurospheres are endowed with a higher ability to generate secondary neurospheres: 20.4 ± 1.3% of SP cells as compared to 4.6 ± 0.4% of MP cells (p < 0.001) (Figure S1D). The rare spheres formed from the MP fraction may result in part from the low contamination with SP cells, as shown by the reanalysis of the sample directly after sorting (Figure S1D, right panel); it is also possible that rare stem cells exist that do not efflux Hoechst dye. Overall, these data demonstrate that SP cells are enriched in cancer stem-like cell characteristics and self-renewal ability. We then evaluated the drug resistance property of the side population; SP and MP neurosphere cultures were exposed to 50 nM mitoxantone and analyzed for their proliferation rate using an MTT assay. Mitoxantrone has been reported to be a substrate of ABCG2, and its efflux by the transporter is a determinant mechanism of drug resistance. As stated above, MP cells possess a lower ability to form neurospheres; consequently, the initial proliferative rate of these cells was below the detection limit of the assay. We found that SP cells are more resistant to mitoxantrone and were sensitized by concurrent blockade of ABCG2 using FTC (Figure 2E). In SP cells, the quantitative decrease in proliferation induced by incubation with both mitoxantrone and FTC did not reach that produced by mitoxantrone alone in total neurosphere culture. This suggests that additional mechanisms, other than efflux by ABC transporters, might also be involved in drug resistance. One possibility proposed recently (Bao et al., 2006Bao S. Wu Q. McLendon R.E. Hao Y. Shi Q. Hjelmeland A.B. Dewhirst M.W. Bigner D.D. Rich J.N. Glioma stem cells promote radioresistance by preferential activation of the DNA damage response.Nature. 2006; 444: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (4431) Google Scholar) involves an increased capacity of stem cells for DNA-damage repair. Taken together, these data indicate that ABCG2 is expressed in neurospheres, allows for the selection of SP cells, and participates in resistance to chemotherapy. Akt has been shown to regulate the SP phenotype in bone marrow cells, and similar effects were reported in breast cancer cells after PTEN loss (Zhou et al., 2007Zhou J. Wulfkuhle J. Zhang H. Gu P. Yang Y. Deng J. Margolick J.B. Liotta L.A. Petricoin III, E. Zhang Y. Activation of the PTEN/mTOR/STAT3 pathway in breast cancer stem-like cells is required for viability and maintenance.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 16158-16163Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). To test whether loss of PTEN could modulate the SP in gliomas, we compared the amount of SP cells in neurospheres isolated from PDGF-induced gliomas in both PTEN intact and PTEN-deficient mice (by Cre recombinase). Five different tumors were analyzed in each group; loss of PTEN and increased in pAKT level in neurospheres were confirmed by immunoblot (Figure S1E). The loss of PTEN produced a pronounced increase of the SP fraction; the PTEN-deleted cells contained 33.1 ± 4.0% SP cells versus 15.5 ± 1.5% in PTEN intact (Figure 3A). While mitoxantrone induced an arrest of PDGF-neurospheres in the G0/G1 phase, the higher level of SP cells in PTEN-deleted cells resulted in increased resistant to mitoxantrone, an effect that was reversed by incubation with FTC (Figure S1F). Incubation of neurospheres with the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 (20 μM) strongly reduced the proportion of SP cells in both PDGF (3.6 ± 0.4%-fold) and PDGF/PTEN deleted (3.0 ± 0.7%-fold) tumors, confirming that PI3K regulates the SP phenotype (Figure 3A). We confirmed this observation using the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 and found that it reduced the amount of SP cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S2A). No substantial difference in ABCG2 protein and mRNA levels were detected upon treatment with LY294002 (Figure 3E and Figure S2B), suggesting that PI3K activity regulates ABCG2 function rather than its expression. None of the other ABC transporters tested showed a difference in mRNA levels after treatment with LY294002 (Figure S2B). LY294002 has been reported to induce a translocation of ABCG2 from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum. To determine if such a mechanism also occurs in glioma cancer stem-like cells, we stained PTEN-deleted cells for ABCG2 after 16 hr treatment with LY294002. We observed a change in the localization of the protein, presenting a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern as compared to the membrane staining in the control (Figure 3B). We then determined the relative tumorigenic potential of side population cells isolated from neurospheres derived from PDGF-driven PTEN-deleted tumors. We have already demonstrated in our mouse model that loss of PTEN correlates with higher-grade and tumor latency. Following Hoechst staining, we sorted SP and MP cells: 1 × 104 cells were injected intracranially in newborn pups (20 mice per group). When mice presented symptoms of intracranial pathology such as lethargy, weight loss, and macrocephaly, the animals were sacrificed and evaluated for tumors by histology. In general, these secondary tumors exhibited features of high-grade gliomas such as microvascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis (Figure S2C). In two cases, we noticed subcutaneous proliferation on the head of mice injected with MP cells, but not in the cranial lesions; these mice were not included in the analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that in the absence of PTEN, SP cells are highly tumorigenic as compared to MP cells, showing higher tumor frequency and shorter latency (p < 0.0001) (Figure 3C). As observed for the low sphere-formation ability of MP cells, tumor formation induced by this fraction might also result from the contamination with SP cells or the presence of stem-like cells in the non-SP compartment. We verified that the lower frequency of tumors obtained after the injection of MP cells was not a result of Hoechst dye toxicity by measuring cell viability 10 days after sorting and culture of the SP and MP, as well as the total cell population stained or not with the dye. In all cases, viability was not affected (Figure S2D). In parallel, we incubated total neurosphere culture from PDGF-induced tumors for 90 min with Hoechst and analyzed the cell-cycle distribution 10 days later. No apoptosis or differences in cell-cycle distribution were observed (Figure S2D, right panel). To determine whether ABCG2 is itself tumorigenic, we injected DF1 cells transfected with a RCAS-ABCG2 vector into Ntv-a/Ink4a−/−Arf−/− newborn pups and assessed the tumor incidence. ABCG2 activity was confirmed by the ability of transfected DF1 cells to exclude Hoechst dye (Figure S3A). Of the 25 mice tested, no tumors or lesions were detected up to 6 months after injection. By contrast, RCAS-PDGF induces high-grade gliomas in the vast majority of mice with this background in less than 12 weeks. Unlike the high-grade gliomas formed in the Ntv-a/Ink4a−/−Arf−/− mice, RCAS-PDGF induces low-grade gliomas in Ntv-a/wt mouse background (Ink4a/Arf intact) (Dai et al., 2001Dai C. Celestino J.C. Okada Y. Louis D.N. Fuller G.N. Holland E.C. PDGF autocrine stimulation dedifferentiates cultured astrocytes and induces oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas from neural progenitors and astrocytes in vivo.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined if ABCG2 could increase tumor incidence and grade or reduce latency time in these mice with lower grade tumors. Coinjection of DF1 cells expressing RCAS-PDGF and RCAS-ABCG2 produced the same number and grade of tumors as for RCAS-PDGF alone. These data suggest that ABCG2 is not tumorigenic by itself, nor does it enhance PDGF tumorigenicity. Rather, the SP phenotype, which mainly results from ABCG2 activity, is a useful marker to isolate tumor-initiating cancer stem-like cells. Recent work has suggested that cancer stem-like cells are the source of chemotherapy resistance in cancer with the potential to repopulate a tumor after therapy. Temozolomide, in combination with radiation, is currently the standard treatment for patients with glioblastomas. To investigate whether temozolomide could induce the MDR phenotype in cancer stem-like cells, we evaluated the resistance to temozolomide of neurospheres derived from PDGF-induced gliomas. We performed a step-wise exposure with increasing doses of temozolomide over 2 weeks and assessed for the SP fraction. Four different tumors were analyzed: the treatment led to a 1.5 ± 0.04-fold increase in the SP fraction, reaching up to 30% of total cells (p < 0.05) (Figure 3A). As our data above demonstrate that PTEN loss in gliomas increases SP cell number, we hypothesized that PTEN loss leads to greater temozolomide re"

Proliferative cells are confined to crypts, while differentiated cell types predominantly occupy the villi. We recently demonstrated the existence of a long-lived pool of cycling stem cells defined by Lgr5 expression and intermingled with post-mitotic Paneth cells at crypt bottoms. We have now determined a gene signature for these Lgr5 stem cells. One of the genes within this stem cell signature is the Wnt target Achaete scute-like 2 (Ascl2). Transgenic expression of the Ascl2 transcription factor throughout the intestinal epithelium induces crypt hyperplasia and ectopic crypts on villi. Induced deletion of the Ascl2 gene in adult small intestine leads to disappearance of the Lgr5 stem cells within days. The combined results from these gain- and loss-of-function experiments imply that Ascl2 controls intestinal stem cell fate."

We found that chemotherapy and sublethal irradiation induced minor regression of BM sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs), while lethal irradiation induced severe regression of SECs and required BM transplantation (BMT) for regeneration. Within the BM, VEGFR2 expression specifically demarcated a continuous network of arterioles and SECs, with arterioles uniquely expressing Sca1 and SECs uniquely expressing VEGFR3. Conditional deletion of VEGFR2 in adult mice blocked regeneration of SECs in sublethally irradiated animals and prevented hematopoietic reconstitution. Similarly, inhibition of VEGFR2 signaling in lethally irradiated wild-type mice rescued with BMT severely impaired SEC reconstruction and prevented engraftment and reconstitution of HSPCs. Therefore, regeneration of SECs via VEGFR2 signaling is essential for engraftment of HSPCs and restoration of hematopoiesis.

SECs have a unique expression of adhesion molecules, allowing the trafficking and homing of HSPCs to the BM (Kataoka and Tavassoli, 1985Kataoka M. Tavassoli M.

Studying the BM microvasculature has been hampered due to technical difficulties of working with calcified tissues. Furthermore, the angiogenic pathways regulating SEC maintenance and regeneration are unknown. Thrombospondins deployed from megakaryocytes were identified as negative regulators of BM SECs; however, the positive regulators of SECs are unknown (Kopp et al., 2006Kopp H.G. Hooper A.T. Broekman M.J. Avecilla S.T. Petit I. Luo M. Milde T. Ramos C.A. Zhang F. Kopp T. et al.Thrombospondins deployed by thrombopoietic cells determine angiogenic switch and extent of revascularization.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 3277-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In particular, the contribution of VEGF receptors, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3, in supporting BM angiogenesis has not been investigated. Herein, we established reproducible techniques for staining decalcified BM sections and for performing polyvariate flow cytometric analyses on BM, allowing the definition of an angiogenic profile of BM vasculature distinguishing between arterial vessels and SECs. We show that VEGFR3 is selectively expressed by SECs, but not arterioles, permitting the tracking and quantification of SECs. We demonstrate that, although at steady state, VEGFR2 is dispensable for maintenance of SECs and HSPCs, after myelosuppressive insult, lack of VEGFR2 activation results in impaired regeneration of VEGFR3+Sca1− SECs and HSPCs. Therefore, VEGFR2 is essential for orchestrating the engraftment and restoration of HSPC populations and reconstitution of hematopoiesis. For the first time, we were able to reproducibly immunophenotype BM vessels by modifying standard immunohistochemical (IHC) (see Figure S1 available online) and immunofluorescence (IF) protocols and employing polyvariate flow cytometry. We identified angiogenic signatures and the precise geometric localization of BM arterioles and SECs using a panel of antibodies (Abs) against vascular specific markers, including, but not limited to, VE-cadherin, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, CD31, MECA32, and Sca1 (Figure 1A; Table S1). Furthermore, we genetically tracked the expression of VEGFR2 and VEGFR1 in reporter mice, where the expression of gfp and lacZ are driven by the endogenous VEGFR2 promoter (VEGFR2-GFP mice) (Ema et al., 2006Ema M. Takahashi S. Rossant J. Deletion of the selection cassette, but not cis-acting elements, in targeted Flk1-lacZ allele reveals Flk1 expression in multipotent mesodermal progenitors.Blood. 2006; 107: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) (Figures 1B–1D) and VEGFR1 promoter (VEGFR1-lacZ mice) (Fong et al., 1999Fong G.H. Zhang L. Bryce D.M. Peng J. Increased hemangioblast commitment, not vascular disorganization, is the primary defect in flt-1 knock-out mice.Development. 1999; 126: 3015-3025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively (Figure 1Ac). Using this approach, we found that in steady-state conditions, the vasculature of femurs from C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice consists of small arterioles and capillaries that span the BM and supply radially and regularly distributed SECs (Figures 1A and 1B). SECs are an interconnected network of vessels arising from cortical capillaries and encompass the major BM vascular compartment that interacts with hematopoietic cells (Movie S1). At steady state, both arterioles and SECs were immunopositive for VE-cadherin, MECA32, VEGFR2, and CD31 (Figures 1A–1D; Table S1). β-galactosidase (βGal) staining of BM from VEGFR1-lacZ mice indicated that VEGFR1 is expressed in both arterioles and SECs (Figure 1Ac; Table S1). IHC of BM from WT mice (Figures 1Ae and 1Af) and confocal IF of BM from VEGFR2-GFP mice (Figure 1D) revealed that BM SECs are specifically VEGFR3+ and Sca1−, while arterioles are VEGFR3− and Sca1+. In order to exclude the possibility that VEGFR3+ vessels are of lymphatic origin, we stained femurs for the lymphatic marker LYVE1 and found that the BM is devoid of LYVE1+ lymphatics (data not shown). Based on these studies, we designated an immunophenotypic signature for steady-state BM SECs as VE-cadherin+MECA32+CD31+VEGFR2+VEGFR3+Sca1− while BM arterioles were identified as VE-cadherin+MECA32+CD31+VEGFR2+VEGFR3−Sca1+ (Figure 1; Table S1). Therefore, differential expression of Sca1 and VEGFR3 can be used to identify BM arterioles and SECs. Previous uncorroborated studies have suggested that non-EC populations might express VEGFR2 and VEGFR3. To resolve this issue, we used IF and polyvariate flow cytometry. Osteopontin (OPN) IF on BM from VEGFR2-GFP mice demonstrated that there is no overlap between VEGFR2-GFP+ cells and OPN+ osteoblasts (OBs) (Figure 1B). Co-IF on BM from VEGFR2-GFP mice shows that VEGFR2-GFP+ cells, but not OPN+ OBs, are CD31+ and VE-cadherin+VEGFR3+ (Figures 1B–1D). To confirm that VEGFR2 expression is restricted to SECs, we performed polyvariate flow cytometry on BM mononuclear cells from crushed and enzymatically processed femurs. We show that VEGFR2-GFP+ cells are comprised of CD31+VEGFR2+CD45−CD11b−TER119− SECs, lacking expression of hematopoietic markers (Figure 2A and data not shown). In order to prove that VEGFR3 is expressed exclusively by functional SECs, we injected WT mice with fluorophore-conjugated Isolectin GS-IB4 to identify functional and patent SECs. Using a similar polyvariate flow cytometric approach, we demonstrated that VEGFR3 is expressed on functional CD45−VE-cadherin+Isolectin GS-IB4+ SECs (Figure 2B). In addition, cKit+Lineage−Sca1+ HSPCs (KLS) were VEGFR3−, suggesting that VEGFR3 expression within the BM is restricted to SECs (Figure 2C). Nonetheless, it is possible that subsets of hematopoietic repopulating cells may be VEGFR2+. To rule this out, we purified VEGFR2+GFP+lineage− cells from β-actin-GFP mice, where GFP is universally expressed, and transplanted these cells into lethally irradiated mice with a radioprotective dose of GFP− cells. Consistent with the previously published report (Haruta et al., 2001Haruta H. Nagata Y. Todokoro K. Role of Flk-1 in mouse hematopoietic stem cells.FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 45-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), VEGFR2+GFP+lineage− cells failed to repopulate lethally irradiated mice (Figure 2D), whereas VEGFR2−GFP+ cells reconstituted host hematopoiesis (data not shown). Moreover, we demonstrate that in Col2.3GFP reporter mice, where expression of GFP is driven by the 2.3 kb fragment of the collagen alpha 1 type I promoter and is restricted to OBs (Dacic et al., 2001Dacic S. Kalajzic I. Visnjic D. Lichtler A.C. Rowe D.W. Col1a1-driven transgenic markers of osteoblast lineage progression.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1228-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 were not expressed by GFP+ OBs (Figure 3D). Collectively, these data suggest that the expression of VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 is restricted to SECs, and even if VEGFR2 is expressed on a small population of non-SECs, it does not serve any important hematopoietic function. Therefore, interference with VEGFR2 or VEGFR3 signaling has no direct effect on the reconstitution of OBs or hematopoietic cells. It has been speculated, but not corroborated, that the OBN and BM SECs are spatially separate and functionally distinct entities. To resolve this controversy, we employed VEGFR3 and VE-cadherin as specific markers of BM vasculature to determine the physical location of BM SECs in relation to OBs. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and anti-VEGFR3 IHC demonstrated that BM SECs are always in close proximity or directly apposed to OBs (Figure 3A). Consistent with these results, in Col2.3GFP mice, both in the diaphysis and metaphysis, GFP+ OBs reside in direct apposition to VE-cadherin+VEGFR3+ SECs (Figures 3B and 3C). Three-dimensional imaging confirms that OBs are invested by VEGFR3+ SECs (Movie S2). After treating Col2.3GFP mice with 650 rad, there is a disruption of VE-cadherin+ vessels, while the physical integrity of GFP+ OBs is maintained (Figures 3E and 3F). These data suggest that VEGFR3−VEGFR2− OBs (Figure 3D) and VE-cadherin+VEGFR3+ BM SECs form a continuous compound cellular niche and there is no major regression of GFP+ OBs after irradiation. As shown in Figure 3F, irradiation induces a significant alteration in the BM vasculature. Thus, to define molecular pathways involved in BM SEC regeneration, we employed three models of myelosuppression. This allowed examination of the consequences of mild, moderate, and severe regression of SECs on reconstitution of hematopoiesis. First, we used the 5-fluorouracil (5FU, 250 mg/kg) model of myelosuppression, which induces mild regression of SECs (Figures 4A–4C). To induce moderate and severe vascular regression in the BM, we treated mice with sublethal (650 rad) or lethal (950 rad) irradiation, respectively. We observed an incremental loss of SECs in WT mice treated with 950 rad > 650 rad > 5FU as quantified by costaining with EC-specific markers (Figures 4A–4C). In support of these data, recently it has been shown that irradiation induces regression through nonapoptotic cell death followed by regeneration from surviving vascular cells (Li et al., 2008Li X.M. Hu Z. Jorgensen M.L. Wingard J.R. Slayton W.B. Bone marrow sinusoidal endothelial cells undergo nonapoptotic cell death and are replaced by proliferating sinusoidal cells in situ to maintain the vascular niche following lethal irradiation.Exp. Hematol. 2008; 36: 1143-1156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The severe regression of SECs in mice irradiated with lethal 950 rad dose was rescued with BM transplantation (BMT) with 5 × 105 whole BM cells (950 rad + BMT) (Figure 4C), providing an ideal model to test the role of regeneration of SECs in reconstitution of hematopoiesis. To categorize and quantify the severity and degree of damage to regenerating SECs in each model of myelosuppression, we devised a staging system (Figures 4B and 4C). At days 7 and 10 after treatment of mice with 5FU, 650 rad, or 950 rad with or without BMT, two types of abnormal SECs were evident. During the early recovery after 5FU and early and late phases of recovery after 650 rad, there was a predominance of type I vessels presenting as discontinuous or hemorrhagic vessels (Figures 4B and 4C). Although by day 10, the SECs in 5FU-treated mice were primarily nonhemorrhagic and nondiscontinuous; in mice treated with 650 rad and more prominently with 950 rad (without BMT rescue), SECs were discontinuous and hemorrhagic with denuded ECs from vessel walls, designated as type II regressed vessels (Figures 4B and 4C). There were no normal vessels present in the femurs of mice irradiated with 950 rad without BMT, and by day 10, there was no evidence of vascular regeneration of the regressed vessels (Figure 4C). However, in 950 rad + BMT-treated mice, there was significant vascular recovery with emergence of normal and type I vessels and significant reduction of type II regressed vessels (Figure 4C). These data suggest that BM SECs comprise malleable and dynamic vessels with the potential to regenerate and remodel into functional sinusoids. However, the molecular pathways driving the regeneration and assembly of regressed SECs are unknown. We hypothesized they may involve the activation of VEGF receptors, given their significant expression by BM SECs (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). Using IHC and mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) measurements, we show that VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 are variably expressed by remodeling SECs in 5FU-treated mice (Figure S2A; Table S1) and regressing BM SECs in mice treated with 950 rad at day 5 (Figure S2B; Table S1). Although there is a slight, yet significant, downregulation of VEGFR3 expression during early stages of hematopoietic recovery, there is a robust upregulation of VEGFR2 expression on day 5 postirradiation, as determined by MFI of VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 expression on CD45−VE-cadherin+CD31+Sca1− SECs (Figures S2Ba and S2Bb; Table S1). Furthermore, qPCR on BM from 5FU-treated mice demonstrated that VEGF-C and VEGF-A are significantly upregulated at varying times after myelosuppression (Figures S2Ca and S2Cb), guaranteeing activation of VEGFR2 during hematopoietic recovery. VEGF-A protein was upregulated in BM plasma from 650 rad-treated mice as compared to untreated animals (Figure S2D). These data suggest that VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 and their cognate ligands are present and variably expressed during hematopoietic recovery and may play a role in the reconstruction of regressed SECs without influencing the function of OBs. To test this hypothesis, WT mice, myelosuppressed with 5FU, 650 rad, or 950 rad + BMT, were treated with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against VEGFR2 (DC101) or VEGFR3 (mF4-31C1) (Prewett et al., 1999Prewett M. Huber J. Li Y. Santiago A. O'Connor W. King K. Overholser J. Hooper A. Pytowski B.

Schomber T. Peltonen R. et al.Blocking VEGFR-3 suppresses angiogenic sprouting and vascular network formation.Nature. 2008; 454: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Treatment of 5FU myelosuppressed mice with mAb to either VEGFR2 or VEGFR3 had only marginal effect on delaying vascular recovery within the BM (data not shown). However, when 650 rad-treated mice were injected with mAb to VEGFR2, there was a significant reduction in HSPC reconstitution. On day 14 after irradiation, mice treated with mAb to VEGFR2, but not the control IgG group, showed significant thrombocytopenia (Figure 5A) and reduced number of spleen colony-forming units (CFU-S) (Figure 5B) and BM cell counts (Figure 5C). Defects in BM cytoarchitecture with a predominance of disorganized, leaky, and hemorrhagic (type I vessels) VE-cadherin+ SECs was observed in BM from VEGFR2 mAb-treated mice at 14 days posttreatment (Figure 5D). Additionally, there was a profound decrease in KLS population (Figure 5E) and CFU-C (Figure 5F). These data suggest that blocking VEGFR2 signaling during BM regeneration after myelosuppression interferes with proper assembly of SECs, impairing hematopoiesis. Neutralizing mAb to VEGFR2 blocks only the paracrine/extrakine activation of VEGFR2. As VEGFR2 can be activated by both extrakine and intrakine loops in ECs (Lee et al., 2007Lee S. Chen T.T.

Autocrine VEGF signaling is required for vascular homeostasis.Cell. 2007; 130: 691-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), we generated mice with floxed VEGFR2 alleles to interrogate the role of complete VEGFR2 deficiency on the reconstitution of HSPCs in steady-state conditions and after myelosuppression in adult mice. We targeted exon 3 of the vegfr2 gene, which does not contain any known regulatory elements, to generate VEGFR2e3loxP/e3loxP mice (Figures S3A and S3B). VEGFR2e3loxP/e3loxP mice were bred with the VEGFR2+/− line to generate VEGFR2e3loxP/− mice. These animals were crossed with ROSA-CreERT2 transgenic mice, to establish the ROSA-CreERT2 VEGFR2e3loxP/− experimental mice and ROSA-CreERT2VEGFR2e3loxP/+ controls (Figure S3C). Tamoxifen treatment of these mice yielded VEGFR2flox/− and control VEGFR2flox/+ mice. VEGFR2flox/− mice have complete knockdown of VEGFR2 in BM as determined by real-time PCR of genomic DNA for VEGFR2 gene excision (Figure S3D) and IHC for VEGFR2 protein (Figure S3E). There were no defects in steady-state hematopoiesis in VEGFR2flox/− mice, with white blood cells (WBCs) and platelets remaining at normal levels several weeks after tamoxifen treatment (Figures 5Gb and 5Gc). Furthermore, at steady state, VEGFR3+ SECs in VEGFR2flox/− mice were phenotypically normal (Figure 5Ga). This is consistent with results in which WT mice at steady state but chronically treated with mAb to VEGFR2 (or VEGFR3) did not show any hematological defects during and after treatment (Figure S4). These data suggest that, although during embryonic development deletion of VEGFR2 (Ema et al., 2006Ema M. Takahashi S. Rossant J.

To determine whether inhibition of both paracrine and intrakine VEGFR2 signaling is more effective in blocking regeneration of SECs and imparting a more severe hematopoietic impairment, VEGFR2flox/− mice were sublethally challenged with 650 rad. As compared to control mice, there was a significant delay in WBC (Figure 5Gb) and platelet (Figure 5Gc) recovery in VEGFR2flox/− mice, with persistent life-threatening pancytopenia on day 10 postirradiation. Furthermore, there was a severe defect in recovery of VEGFR3+ SECs resulting in the appearance of type II regressed vessels (Figures 5H–5J). These data suggest that loss of both VEGFR2 intrakine and extrakine signaling results in a considerable impairment in SEC regeneration and defects in hematopoietic reconstitution. Therefore, the extent of damage to SECs and the degree of VEGFR2 inhibition dictate the rate of reconstruction of SECs and hematopoietic recovery.

Originally characterized from platelets, microvesicles are a normal constituent of human plasma, where they play an important role in maintaining hematostasis. Microvesicles have been shown to transfer proteins and RNA from cell to cell and they are also believed to play a role in intercellular communication. We characterized the RNA and protein content of embryonic stem cell microvesicles and show that they can be engineered to carry exogenously expressed mRNA and protein such as green fluorescent protein (GFP). We demonstrate that these engineered microvesicles dock and fuse with other embryonic stem cells, transferring their GFP. Additionally, we show that embryonic stem cells microvesicles contain abundant microRNA and that they can transfer a subset of microRNAs to mouse embryonic fibroblasts in vitro. Since microRNAs are short (21–24 nt), naturally occurring RNAs that regulate protein translation, our findings open up the intriguing possibility that stem cells can alter the expression of genes in neighboring cells by transferring microRNAs contained in microvesicles. Embryonic stem cell microvesicles may be useful therapeutic tools for transferring mRNA, microRNAs, protein, and siRNA to cells and may be important mediators of signaling within stem cell niches."
https://openalex.org/W2166430233,"In the mouse neocortex, neural progenitor cells generate both differentiating neurons and daughter cells that maintain progenitor fate. Here, we show that the TRIM-NHL protein TRIM32 regulates protein degradation and microRNA activity to control the balance between those two daughter cell types. In both horizontally and vertically dividing progenitors, TRIM32 becomes polarized in mitosis and is concentrated in one of the two daughter cells. TRIM32 overexpression induces neuronal differentiation while inhibition of TRIM32 causes both daughter cells to retain progenitor cell fate. TRIM32 ubiquitinates and degrades the transcription factor c-Myc but also binds Argonaute-1 and thereby increases the activity of specific microRNAs. We show that Let-7 is one of the TRIM32 targets and is required and sufficient for neuronal differentiation. TRIM32 is the mouse ortholog of Drosophila Brat and Mei-P26 and might be part of a protein family that regulates the balance between differentiation and proliferation in stem cell lineages."

We now provide evidence that one of these proteins, TANGO1, is an integral membrane protein localized to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites, with a luminal SH3 domain and a cytoplasmic proline-rich domain (PRD). Knockdown of TANGO1 inhibits export of bulky collagen VII from the ER. The SH3 domain of TANGO1 binds to collagen VII; the PRD binds to the COPII coat subunits, Sec23/24. In this scenario, PRD binding to Sec23/24 subunits could stall COPII carrier biogenesis to permit the luminal domain of TANGO1 to guide SH3-bound cargo into a growing carrier. All cells except those of hematopoietic origin express TANGO1. We propose that TANGO1 exports other cargoes in cells that do not secrete collagen VII.

Newly synthesized secretory proteins exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in so-called COPII-coated vesicles (Bonifacino and Glick, 2004Bonifacino J.S. Glick B.S.

A large number of proteins are required for the biogenesis of these vesicles, including chaperones and enzymes that fold the newly synthesized protein in the lumen of the ER, receptors that bind secretory cargo and help their recruitment into the newly forming carriers, structural coat proteins that help mold the flat ER membrane into a bud and promote its growth into a vesicular element, and components that catalyze the budding of cargo-loaded carriers from the ER (Herrmann et al., 1999Herrmann J.M.

COPII coat-mediated budding of vesicles from the ER is relatively well characterized. Two layers of coat proteins comprised of a Sec23/24 inner layer and a Sec13/31 outer layer are recruited to the membrane surface by Sar1-GTP at specific ER exit sites that are marked by the protein Sec16 (Bonifacino and Glick, 2004Bonifacino J.S.

Less is known about how cargo proteins are collected into nascent vesicles. Whether it is a passive process (bulk flow) or actively mediated by cargo receptors has been debated extensively (Wieland et al., 1987Wieland F.T. Gleason M.L. Serafini T.A. Rothman J.E.

Support in favor of the bulk flow proposal, however, is waning by recent growing evidence that cargo loading into COPII carriers utilizes receptors and chaperones (Lee et al., 2004Lee M.C.

The receptors identified thus far appear to exit with the outgoing cargo, whereas the chaperones mostly stay behind in the ER (Lee et al., 2004Lee M.C. Miller E.A. Goldberg J. Orci L. Schekman R. Bi-directional protein transport between the ER and Golgi.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 87-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Prominent examples of cargo receptors are ERGIC 53 for the transport of coagulation factors V and VIII, cathepsin C and Z, and α1-antitrypsin; Erv29p/Surf4 for the export of soluble cargo proteins such as precursor of α factor mating pheromone; and Emp24p for GPI-anchored membrane protein Gas1p (Belden and Barlowe, 2001Belden W.J.

Receptor-mediated protein transport in the early secretory pathway.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Another well-characterized cargo receptor is the KDEL receptor, which traffics KDEL-containing proteins from the Golgi to the ER (Munro and Pelham, 1987Munro S. Pelham H.R.

Unsolved mysteries in membrane traffic.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 629-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Chaperones primarily assist in the folding of newly synthesized proteins and, therefore, are required for export from the ER. In addition to the conventional chaperones, BAP31 and the yeast-specific Shr3p also appear to function as cargo receptors (Baines and Zhang, 2007Baines A.C. Zhang B.

It has been estimated that as many as 35% of the entire human genome enters the secretory pathway at the ER. Considering the quantity and the diversity of cargo exported by this compartment, the number of receptors identified thus far seems surprisingly low. We performed a genome-wide screen in Drosophila tissue culture S2 cells to identify transport components (Bard et al., 2006Bard F. Casano L. Mallabiabarrena A. Wallace E. Saito K. Kitayama H. Guizzunti G. Hu Y. Wendler F. Dasgupta R. et al.Functional genomics reveals genes involved in protein secretion and Golgi organization.Nature. 2006; 439: 604-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This screen revealed a number of previously unidentified genes required for transport and Golgi organization (TANGO genes). TANGO1 from this collection emerges as a guide for loading the cargo molecule collagen VII into COPII carriers. Our findings provide further proof that collagen VII export from the ER is not by bulk flow. Drosophila TANGO1 contains an SH3-like domain at its N terminus, followed by a potential transmembrane (TM) domain, a coiled-coiled domain, and a C-terminal, proline-rich domain (PRD). The mammalian ortholog of TANGO1 was identified by sequence comparison, cloned, and HA-epitope tagged at its C terminus. The domain organization of human TANGO1 is basically the same as Drosophila TANGO1 except for two closely situated potential transmembrane domains that were found in the databases (amino acids 1143–1165 and 1183–1205) (Figure 1A). A polyclonal antiserum was generated against the PRD (C-terminal amino acids 1884–1898) of TANGO1 and affinity purified. HA-tagged TANGO1 was expressed in COS7 cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and blotted with either anti-HA or anti-TANGO1 antibodies. Both antibodies recognized the exogenously expressed, tagged protein (Figure 1B, lanes 1 and 2). TANGO1 migrates slower than the expected molecular mass on SDS-PAGE. To detect the endogenous protein, HeLa cell extracts were either immunoprecipitated with anti-TANGO1 antibody followed by western blotting with anti-TANGO1 antibody (Figure 1B, lane 3), or cell extracts from HeLa (Figure 1B, lane 4) and A431 (Figure 1B, lane 5) were directly western blotted with anti-TANGO1 antibody. These experiments revealed a major polypeptide of > 250 kDa, which has the same mobility as the exogenously expressed, HA-tagged TANGO1. This indicates that we have cloned the mammalian TANGO1 and the antibody is suitable for further characterization of this polypeptide. It has been reported that the N-terminal 125 amino acid, which includes the SH3-like domain of TANGO1, is secreted (Bosserhoff et al., 2004Bosserhoff A.K. Moser M. Buettner R. Characterization and expression pattern of the novel MIA homolog TANGO.Gene Expr. Patterns. 2004; 4: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This portion has been given the name TANGO (the name is coincidently the same as our transport and Golgi organization) and MIA3 (melanoma inhibitory activity 3) (Bosserhoff et al., 2004Bosserhoff A.K. Moser M. Buettner R. Characterization and expression pattern of the novel MIA homolog TANGO.Gene Expr. Patterns. 2004; 4: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The reported sequence contains a termination codon at the 376 base pair region of TANGO1 and is listed as US patent WO 00/12762 (Bosserhoff et al., 2004Bosserhoff A.K. Moser M. Buettner R. Characterization and expression pattern of the novel MIA homolog TANGO.Gene Expr. Patterns. 2004; 4: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); however, there are no such sequences in the NCBI databases. Our RT-PCR also did not reveal a termination codon at this site. Moreover, the database search for other species, including Drosophila, zebrafish, and mouse, did not reveal termination codons at the reported site. The origin of TANGO, therefore, remains speculative, but it is possible that, under certain conditions, a spliced variant of TANGO1 is secreted. However, our results here describe the full-length TANGO1 (1907 amino acids), which is localized to the ER exit sites and is not secreted (see below). The affinity-purified antiserum was used to visualize the localization of endogenous TANGO1 protein in HeLa cells. The antibody staining localized to punctate structures, 80% of which colocalized with transfected Sec16L, a bona fide component of ER exit sites (Figure 1C, panel 1). The antibody also displayed a 60% colocalization with the endogenous ER exit site protein Sec31A (Figure 1C, panel 2). ERGIC-53 of the intermediate compartment (or ERGIC) appears as a collection of perinuclear elements and punctate elements that are distributed throughout the cytoplasm. There was only partial colocalization (30%) between TANGO1 and the dispersed (peripheral) ERGIC-53 (Figure 1C, panel 3). No colocalization was observed between TANGO1 and the perinuclear ERGIC-53 and between TANGO1 and β-COP (Figure 1C, panels 3 and 4). Thus, TANGO1 is localized to the majority of ER exit sites. HeLa cells were transfected with control or TANGO1-specific siRNA. Immunofluorescence microscopy and western blotting with anti-TANGO1 antibody was used to determine the depletion of endogenous TANGO1. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed the loss of TANGO1 staining from the ER exit sites (Figure S1A available online). Western blotting revealed > 90% reduction in TANGO1 protein levels (Figure S1B). Thus, TANGO1 localizes to the ER exit sites, the anti-TANGO1 antibody is suitable for analysis of the endogenous protein, and the siRNA efficiently depletes TANGO1 in mammalian cells. To determine the topology of TANGO1, we made use of the fact that digitonin can be used to selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane, and, after paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixation, treatment of the same cells with Triton X-100 permeabilizes both plasma membrane and intracellular membranes. The cytoplasmically oriented region of the protein should be visible by fluorescence microscopy in cells treated with digitonin, whereas detection of the luminal domain of a membrane protein should require treatment with Triton X-100. As shown in Figure 2A, an antibody that recognizes the luminal domain of ERGIC-53 required Triton permeabilization for binding to its cognate epitope. In contrast, GM130, which is peripherally attached to the cytoplasmic surface of cis-Golgi cisternae, was visible by immunofluorescence microscopy in cells treated with digitonin only (Figure 2A). The anti-TANGO1 C-terminal-specific antibody was, therefore, used to reveal the orientation of this domain across the ER. As shown in Figure 2A, digitonin treatment followed by fixation with PFA was sufficient to visualize endogenous TANGO1 protein with the C-terminal specific, anti-TANGO1 antibody. This suggests that the C-terminal residues face the cytoplasmic side. When TANGO1 is expressed exogenously in cells and fixed with PFA, it yields a more diffused ER staining, but this should not affect the topology of the protein. To determine the orientation of the N-terminal SH3 domain, we generated a tagged version of TANGO1 in which a FLAG tag was placed between the signal sequence and the SH3 domain and an HA tag was introduced at the C terminus of TANGO1 (FLAG-TANGO1-HA). The transfected HeLa cells were treated with digitonin followed by fixation and incubated with either anti-FLAG or HA antibodies (stage I). The cells were then washed, treated with Triton X-100, and incubated with anti-TANGO1 antibody (stage II). The transfected cells were identified by higher TANGO1 staining compared with the nontransfected cells. These cells were also visualized for the staining with anti-FLAG or HA antibodies. Although HA antibody gave a strong signal in these cells (Figure 2B, lane 2), the N-terminally localized FLAG epitope was not detected in transfected cells permeabilized with digitonin only (Figure 2B, lane 1). Treatment of these cells with Triton revealed both the N terminus FLAG and the C terminus HA tag as expected (Figure 2B, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, the transfected protein appears to show the correct topology, and the FLAG epitope is not accessible to the antibody in digitonin-permeabilized cells. This provides strong evidence that the SH3 domain is localized in the lumen of the ER. As an additional and more quantitative approach to determine the orientation of TANGO1 in the ER, we tested the susceptibility of FLAG-TANGO1-HA to partial proteolysis with trypsin. FLAG-TANGO1-HA was expressed in COS7 cells; the cells were permeabilized with digitonin and then treated with trypsin. Following trypsin inactivation, the cells were lysed, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and western blotted with anti-FLAG antibody (Figure S2, top panel) or immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody followed by western blotting with anti-HA antibody (Figure S2, bottom panel). Under these conditions, the C-terminal HA tag was lost upon trypsinization. The N-terminal FLAG tag was, however, protected from proteolysis, and the corresponding TANGO1 protein was migrated with the mobility predicted for the remaining N terminus up to the two putative transmembrane domains of TANGO1 (Figure S2, top panel, lanes 4 and 6). Extraction with low concentration (0.05%) of Triton X-100 followed by trypsin treatment digested the protein, which was not recognized by both anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies (Figure S2, lane 5). SOSUI and PHDhtm, programs that predict potential TM domains, suggest two such domains at amino acids 1143–1165 and 1183–1205, respectively, in TANGO1. This is intriguing because the results described above (Figures 2A, 2B, S2) suggest that the N-terminal half of TANGO1 is in the lumen and the C-terminal half is in the cytoplasm. To achieve this topology, however, there should be either one or three TM domains. To test this experimentally, we generated recombinant TANGO1-HA (HA tag is at the C terminus) lacking the first (ΔTM1), second (ΔTM2), or both potential TM domains (ΔTM1+2). The respective constructs were expressed in HeLa cells. Cells were treated with digitonin, fixed, and stained with HA antibody. The cells were then treated with Triton X-100 and stained with TANGO1 antibody. We hypothesized that deletion of all TM domains would cause the polypeptide to be entirely luminal and, therefore, not bound to the C-terminal-specific anti-HA antibody in cells treated with digitonin only. Anti-TANGO1 antibody will recognize both the endogenous and exogenous TANGO1, but the cells expressing the exogenous protein will reveal higher (brighter) staining. As shown in Figure 2C, deletion of either TM domain did not affect staining with the anti-HA antibody. However, deletion of both TM domains resulted in the loss of staining. Based on these data, we suggest that one of the TM domains spans the membrane, whereas the second must be partially inserted into the inner or outer leaflet but does not cross the ER membrane (Figure 2D). Three different mutant forms of TANGO1 were generated and expressed in HeLa cells. Construct ΔSH3 lacks the luminally oriented SH3 domain, amino acids 48–106; construct ΔCT lacks the C-terminal amino acids 1601–1907; and construct ΔCT2 lacks amino acids 1751–1907. All constructs that contained a C-terminal HA tag were visualized with anti-HA antibody. Construct ΔSH3 localized to the ER exit sites similarly to the full-length protein (Figure 3A, upper panel). Constructs ΔCT and ΔCT2, lacking the PRD, were found dispersed in the ER (Figure 3A, lower panel). This suggests that the PRD is required for the localization of TANGO1 to the ER exit sites. COPII component Sec31 contains a PRD that binds to Sec23/Sec24 (Bi et al., 2007Bi X. Mancias J.D. Goldberg J.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4547-4556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested by yeast two-hybrid whether the TANGO1 PRD also interacts with Sec23/Sec24. The PRD in TANGO1 stretches from amino acids 1751–1907. Figure 4B shows three constructs of TANGO1 used to investigate the importance of the PRD: CT (amino acids 1601–1907), CT1 (1601–1750), and CT2 (1751–1907) were used in yeast two-hybrid for interaction with COPII components Sec23A, Sec24C, and Sec31A. Only the PRD containing constructs CT and CT2 were found to interact with both Sec23A and Sec24C (Figure 3B). There was no interaction detected between the CT domains and Sec31A (Figure 3B). These results indicate that the C-terminal PRD of TANGO1 can bind to Sec23 and Sec24. Given that this domain is required for ER exit site localization, it seems reasonable to conclude that TANGO1 is localized to ER exit sites by interaction with Sec23/Sec24. TANGO1 was selected in a screen for genes involved in secretion of the soluble protein ss-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in Drosophila tissue culture S2 cells (Bard et al., 2006Bard F. Casano L. Mallabiabarrena A. Wallace E. Saito K. Kitayama H. Guizzunti G. Hu Y. Wendler F. Dasgupta R. et al.Functional genomics reveals genes involved in protein secretion and Golgi organization.Nature. 2006; 439: 604-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with control or TANGO1 siRNA followed by transfection with ss-HRP. Knockdown of TANGO1 inhibited HRP secretion by about 50% (Figure S3). However, TANGO1 depletion by siRNA in HeLa cells did not affect the trafficking of another secreted protein, alkaline phosphatase (Figure S3), and the integral membrane protein, VSV-G (data not shown). The effect of TANGO1 depletion on the secretion of exogenously expressed, plant-specific protein HRP is, therefore, quite surprising. To further test the involvement of TANGO1 in protein secretion and cellular physiology, we searched for TANGO1 binding partners by mass spectrometric analysis of immunoprecipitated endogenous TANGO1 from HeLa cell extracts. This procedure revealed six specific peptides of human collagen VII (Figure 4A). Since collagen VII is a secreted protein, it is likely to bind to the luminal domain of TANGO1. To test this proposal, we generated various domains of FLAG-tagged TANGO1. These domains were expressed in COS7 cells and immunoisolated with anti-FLAG antibody. Tissue culture medium containing secreted collagen VII from RDEB/FB/C7 cells was collected and incubated with beads containing immunoisolated FLAG-TANGO1. The beads were washed and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting with anti-collagen VII antibody. The results show that full-length FLAG-TANGO1 (full) and the luminal domain of TANGO1 (lumen) bind to collagen VII (Figure 4B). TANGO1 lacking the luminal domain (cytoplasm) or the SH3 domain (ΔSH3) does not bind to collagen VII (Figure 4B). The same results were obtained when recombinant proteins were used as a source for collagen VII (data not shown). These findings strongly indicate the significance of the luminal SH3 domain of TANGO1 for binding to collagen VII. Collagen VII is expressed in skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Therefore, we tested these cell types for the significance of TANGO1 in collagen VII secretion. We first tested A431 (human keratinocyte-like) cells for a role of TANGO1 in collagen VII secretion. Although these cells synthesize and secrete collagen VII, it is essentially impossible to detect an intracellular pool of collagen VII by immunofluorescence microscopy under steady-state conditions. However, about 50% of the cells revealed accumulation of collagen VII in the ER upon depletion of TANGO1 by siRNA (Figure 5A). This suggests that, without TANGO1, synthesized collagen VII fails to exit the ER. Collagen VII, consequently, accumulates in the ER and is, therefore, detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. To rule out the possibility that TANGO1 transcriptionally regulates collagen VII synthesis, we tested human 293/C7 cells stably expressing collagen VII under cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter for the involvement of TANGO1 in its export. The 293/C7 cells were transfected with control or TANGO1 siRNA. Culture medium from the cells was western blotted with anti-collagen VII antibody. The results revealed that the quantity of collagen VII secreted from TANGO1-depleted cells was about 80% less compared with control cells (Figure 5B). There was a concomitant, 3-fold increase in the intracellular pool of collagen VII in cells depleted of TANGO1 (Figure 5B). We then tested the involvement of TANGO1 in collagen VII secretion from RDEB/FB/C7 human skin fibroblast cells. These fibroblasts stably express and secrete collagen VII and also secrete a detectable amount of endogenous collagen I. Depletion of TANGO1 revealed > 70% inhibition in collagen VII secretion without any appreciable effect on collagen I secretion (Figure 5C). To further ascertain the involvement of TANGO1 in collagen I secretion, we transfected human fibroblast cell line Saos2, which synthesizes and secretes collagen I, with control or TANGO1 siRNA. These cells do not secrete collagen VII. TANGO1 was efficiently depleted from these cells (> 90% knockdown), but there were no obvious effects on the secretion of collagen I (Figure 5D). Ascorbic acid, a cofactor for prolyl 4-hydroxylase, regulates synthesis and folding of collagens to generate a trimeric collagen in the ER (Pinnel et al., 1987Pinnel S.R. Murad S. Darr D. Induction of collagen synthesis by ascorbic acid. A possible mechanism.Arch. Dermatol. 1987; 123: 1684-1686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the effect of ascorbic acid on collagen VII secretion in RDEB/FB/C7 cells. Because these cells express collagen VII under a CMV promoter, the effects of ascorbic acid on the synthesis of collagen VII can be excluded. The addition of 2 μg/ml ascorbic acid to the cells caused about a 5-fold increase in collagen VII secretion (Figure S4). RDEB/FB/C7 cells grown in the presence of ascorbic acid were transfected with TANGO1 siRNA, and its effects on collagen VII secretion were monitored by western blotting. The secreted collagen was analyzed in the absence or presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) to visualize trimeric (900 kDa) and monomeric (290 kDa) collagen VII. Our findings reveal that RDEB/FB/C7 cells secrete trimeric collagen, which increases in the presence of ascorbic acid, and that knockdown of TANGO1 inhibited secretion of trimeric collagen VII by > 50%. Under the same conditions, collagen I secretion was not affected (data not shown). These results strongly indicate that TANGO1 is required for the secretion of fully folded trimeric collagen VII (Figure S4). To test whether TANGO1 is required for general protein export from the ER, A431 cells were transfected with control or TANGO1 siRNA. The cells were pulsed with [35S]-methionine for 1 hr followed by a chase for 3 hr. The cells treated with Brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of protein export, were also pulsed and chased. The medium was collected at 0, 1, 2, and 3 hr of chase and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 6% and 12% gels (to separate the high- and low-molecular weight polypeptides) followed by autoradiography. Our findings reveal that TANGO1 knockdown does not affect the overall amount of protein secreted by A431 cells (Figure 5E). BFA treatment of the control cells, as expected, efficiently inhibited the amount of total protein secretion from A431 cells (Figure 5E). We also tested the effect of TANGO1 knockdown on the organization of ER and the ER exit sites. We observed an aggregation of Sec16L and Sec24D upon TANGO1 knockdown in A431 cells (Figure S5). Electron microscopy analysis revealed a 2-fold increase in the average length of ER cisternae and a 2.5-fold increase in the density of ER in TANGO1-depleted A431 cells (Figure S6). HeLa cells, which synthesize and secrete less collagen VII than do A431 cells, showed marginal effects on the organization of Sec16L, Sec24D, and the overall ER organization (data not shown). Thus, the effects of TANGO1 in the organization of ER exit sites and ER are likely indirect due to the accumulation of collagen VII within the ER. Taken together, our findings suggest that TANGO1 does not have a role in global protein secretion; it appears to be specific for secretion of trimeric collagen VII. TANGO1 binds to collagen VII in the lumen of the ER and COPII components, Sec23/24 on the cytoplasmic side. These interactions require SH3 and PRD of TANGO1, respectively. Is TANGO1 loaded into COPII carriers and exported from the ER? This is an important issue as other cargo receptors such as ERGIC53, Erv29p, and KDEL-R bind their specific cargoes and are exported from"
https://openalex.org/W2085393352,"Distinct molecules are segregated into somatodendritic and axonal compartments of polarized neurons, but mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of such segregation remain largely unclear. In cultured hippocampal neurons, we observed an ankyrin G- and F-actin-dependent structure that emerged in the cytoplasm of the axon initial segment (AIS) within 2 days after axon/dendrite differentiation, imposing a selective filter for diffusion of macromolecules and transport of vesicular carriers into the axon. Axonal entry was allowed for KIF5-driven carriers of synaptic vesicle protein VAMP2, but not for KIF17-driven carriers of dendrite-targeting NMDA receptor subunit NR2B. Comparisons of transport rates between chimeric forms of KIF17 and KIF5B, with the motor and cargo-binding domains switched, and between KIF5 loaded with VAMP2 versus GluR2 suggest that axonal entry of vesicular carriers depends on the transport efficacy of KIF-cargo complexes. This selective AIS filtering may contribute to preferential trafficking and segregation of cellular components in polarized neurons."

Genetic, biochemical, and structural studies implicate the Ndc80 complex as a direct point of contact between kinetochores and microtubules, but these approaches provide only a static view. Here, using techniques for manipulating and tracking individual molecules in vitro, we demonstrate that the Ndc80 complex is capable of forming the dynamic, load-bearing attachments to assembling and disassembling tips required for coupling in vivo. We also establish that Ndc80-based coupling likely occurs through a biased diffusion mechanism and that this activity is conserved from yeast to humans. Our findings demonstrate how an ensemble of Ndc80 complexes may provide the combination of plasticity and strength that allows kinetochores to maintain load-bearing tip attachments during both microtubule assembly and disassembly.

Our findings demonstrate how an ensemble of Ndc80 complexes may provide the combination of plasticity and strength that allows kinetochores to maintain load-bearing tip attachments during both microtubule assembly and disassembly. Chromosomes are organized and separated during cell division by a molecular machine, the mitotic spindle. A central component of this machine is the kinetochore, a specialized site on each chromosome that forms attachments to spindle microtubules. Besides mechanically coupling the chromosomes to microtubules, kinetochores are also regulatory hubs. They control chromosome movement by altering the growth and shortening of attached microtubules, they sense and correct errors in attachment, and they emit diffusible “wait” signals until they are properly attached. These regulatory functions are all vital for accurate mitosis, and they are all related to microtubule attachment. To understand kinetochore function, we must uncover the basis for its most fundamental behavior—microtubule attachment. As the spindle forms, kinetochores make initial attachments to the sides of spindle microtubules. These lateral (“side-on”) attachments convert quickly into tip (“end-on”) attachments and, thereafter, chromosome movement is coupled to filament assembly and disassembly (Rieder and Salmon, 1998Rieder C.L. Salmon E.D. The vertebrate cell kinetochore and its roles during mitosis.Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 310-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Kinetochore-microtubule coupling requires a puzzling combination of strength and dynamicity. Molecules at each kinetochore-microtubule interface must maintain a persistent, load-bearing attachment to the filament tip even while thousands of tubulin subunits are added and removed. This strong yet dynamic coupling allows kinetochores to harness microtubule shortening to drive poleward chromosome movement and also to track with growing tips during antipoleward movement (or during microtubule “flux”). While the behavior is conserved from yeast to humans (McAinsh et al., 2003McAinsh A.D. Tytell J.D. Sorger P.K. Structure, function, and regulation of budding yeast kinetochores.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Models for kinetochore-microtubule coupling fall into several classes. In one class, coupling is based on ATP-powered motor enzymes. Motors likely contribute to coupling in many organisms (Sharp et al., 2000Sharp D.J. Rogers G.C. Scholey J.M.

However, kinetochore-bound motors are largely dispensable in yeast (Grishchuk and McIntosh, 2006Grishchuk E.L. McIntosh J.R.

In a second class of models, peeling protofilaments at disassembling tips drive kinetochore movement either by pushing against a sliding ring (Koshland et al., 1988Koshland D.E. Mitchison T.J. Kirschner M.W. Polewards chromosome movement driven by microtubule depolymerization in vitro.Nature. 1988; 331: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) or by tugging on tightly bound kinetochore fibrils (McIntosh et al., 2008McIntosh J.R. Grishchuk E.L. Morphew M.K. Efremov A.K. Zhudenkov K. Volkov V.A. Cheeseman I.M. Desai A. Mastronarde D.N. Ataullakhanov F.I. Fibrils connect microtubule tips with kinetochores: A mechanism to couple tubulin dynamics to chromosome motion.Cell. 2008; 135: 322-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Enthusiasm for the ring model was generated recently by the discovery that the Dam1 kinetochore complex forms rings around microtubules in vitro (Miranda et al., 2005Miranda J.J. De Wulf P. Sorger P.K. Harrison S.C. The yeast DASH complex forms closed rings on microtubules.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). However, while the Dam1 complex is very likely to contribute to tip coupling, microtubule-based force production, and regulation of kinetochore-attached microtubules in yeast (Asbury et al., 2006Asbury C.L. Gestaut D.R. Powers A.F. Franck A.D. Davis T.N. The Dam1 kinetochore complex harnesses microtubule dynamics to produce force and movement.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The Dam1 kinetochore ring complex moves processively on depolymerizing microtubule ends.Nature. 2006; 440: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), no clear homologs have been identified outside fungi. Moreover, ring formation is not required for microtubule-driven movement of the Dam1 complex in vitro (Gestaut et al., 2008Gestaut D.R. Graczyk B. Cooper J. Widlund P.O. Zelter A. Wordeman L. Asbury C.L. Davis T.N. Phosphoregulation and depolymerization-driven movement of the Dam1 complex do not require ring formation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The fibrils model offers an attractive, ring-independent way for peeling protofilaments to exert force on the kinetochore (McIntosh et al., 2008McIntosh J.R. Grishchuk E.L. Morphew M.K. Efremov A.K. Zhudenkov K. Volkov V.A. Cheeseman I.M. Desai A. Mastronarde D.N. Ataullakhanov F.I. Fibrils connect microtubule tips with kinetochores: A mechanism to couple tubulin dynamics to chromosome motion.Cell. 2008; 135: 322-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, processive disassembly-driven movement by this mechanism requires tight binding of the fibrils to the microtubule, which would prevent assembly-coupled movement. Thus, motor-, ring-, and tight fibril-based mechanisms do not appear to fully account for tip coupling in all eukaryotes. In a third class of models, kinetochore-microtubule coupling depends on biased thermal diffusion. This idea was first proposed by Hill, 1985Hill T.L. Theoretical problems related to the attachment of microtubules to kinetochores.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1985; 82: 4404-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, who demonstrated theoretically that an array of individually weak microtubule binders will track with disassembling microtubule tips provided that its diffusion along the filament is sufficiently fast and that its total binding energy is large enough. Because this mechanism provides molecular friction that resists translocation of the microtubule through the attachment, it is sometimes called a “slip clutch” (Maddox et al., 2003Maddox P. Straight A. Coughlin P. Mitchison T.J. Salmon E.D. Direct observation of microtubule dynamics at kinetochores in Xenopus extract spindles: implications for spindle mechanics.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Importantly, a biased diffusion-based coupler supports tension continuously while remaining tip attached during both assembly and disassembly. This behavior distinguishes it from models based on ATP-powered motor proteins or peeling protofilaments, which are fundamentally unidirectional. Although Hill imagined a sleeve-like arrangement of binding elements completely encircling the filament, the physical underpinnings of his model can apply generally to any array of microtubule binders that are linked together, even a disordered array. Extensive genetic, biochemical, and structural studies have established that the Ndc80 complex is crucial for maintaining a robust attachment between kinetochores and microtubule tips across eukaryotes (reviewed in Tanaka and Desai, 2008Tanaka T.U. Desai A. Kinetochore-microtubule interactions: the means to the end.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the ability of the complex to support the strong yet dynamic attachment required for kinetochore-microtubule coupling has never been demonstrated. Here, we show that ensembles of Ndc80 complexes can form load-bearing attachments to assembling and disassembling tips. The properties of this attachment can be fully described by a biased diffusion mechanism. Based on these findings, we propose that the Ndc80 complex forms a slip clutch at the eukaryotic kinetochore. To study Ndc80-based coupling, we adapted a recently developed bead motility assay (Asbury et al., 2006Asbury C.L. Gestaut D.R. Powers A.F. Franck A.D. Davis T.N. The Dam1 kinetochore complex harnesses microtubule dynamics to produce force and movement.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Tension applied through the Dam1 complex promotes microtubule elongation providing a direct mechanism for length control in mitosis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). All four subunits of the S. cerevisiae Ndc80 complex—Ndc80, Nuf2, Spc24, and Spc25—were coexpressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration (Gestaut et al., 2008Gestaut D.R.

USA. 2005; 102: 5363-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) (Figure S1 available online). Purification and binding of the complex to beads were facilitated by a His6 tag on the C terminus of Spc24, a location near the kinetochore-facing end of the complex (∼20 nm away) and farther (∼40 nm) from the N-terminal regions of Ndc80 and Nuf2 shown previously to mediate binding to taxol-stabilized microtubules (Cheeseman et al., 2006Cheeseman I.M.

Beads decorated with the complex were introduced into a chamber containing dynamic microtubules growing from stable, coverslip-anchored seeds. The filaments exhibited dynamic instability typical for microtubules in vitro, switching stochastically between periods of slow growth (at ∼10 nm s−1) and rapid shortening (∼100 nm s−1). To test for binding, we captured candidate beads diffusing freely in solution with a laser trap and held them near the tip of a growing filament. Binding was evident from a sharp reduction in the Brownian motion of the bead, which was monitored with high spatiotemporal resolution using back focal plane interferometry (Asbury et al., 2006Asbury C.L. Gestaut D.R. Powers A.F. Franck A.D. Davis T.N. The Dam1 kinetochore complex harnesses microtubule dynamics to produce force and movement.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, Franck et al., 2007Franck A.D. Powers A.F. Gestaut D.R. Gonen T. Davis T.N. Asbury C.L. Tension applied through the Dam1 complex promotes microtubule elongation providing a direct mechanism for length control in mitosis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Beads coated with full-length Ndc80 complex almost always bound microtubules (82%, 42 of 51 beads tested). Control beads coated with a “headless” version of the complex, 2NCC:2S, lacking the N-terminal regions of Ndc80 and Nuf2 (Wei et al., 2005Wei R.R. Sorger P.K. Harrison S.C. Molecular organization of the Ndc80 complex, an essential kinetochore component.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 5363-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), failed to bind (116 tested). Thus, binding of Ndc80-coated beads to assembling microtubule tips in our assay requires the same molecular domains that mediate binding of the free complex to taxol-stabilized microtubules. In our initial experiments, we shut off the laser trap when the bead bound the microtubule tip to record movement in the absence of external load. Without load, the beads exhibited longitudinal diffusion along the filament as the tip continued to grow (65%, 26 of 40 beads tested) (see Figure 1) or remained stationary on the microtubule lattice (35%, 14 of 40). Most attachments persisted until the filament tip underwent a spontaneous “catastrophe,” disassembling rapidly back to the bead and then carrying it in the direction of shortening (73%, 29 of 40), usually all of the way to the coverslip-anchored seed (52%, 21 of 40). Most of the remaining events were terminated artificially (40%, 16 of 40), often because the bead stuck irreversibly to the coverslip. Spontaneous detachment from the microtubules was rare (8%, 3 of 40). We used automated centroid tracking from video recordings to quantify bead position over time (Figure 1C). The Ndc80-based attachments remained bound to the filaments for a mean duration of 180 ± 30 s (Figure 1F) and underwent disassembly-driven movement over 4800 ± 400 nm on average (Figure 1E). These values underestimate the capacity of the linkages to remain bound and track with disassembly because most events were terminated by the microtubule shortening completely back to the seed, not by detachment. For the subset of beads that diffused along the filaments, mean-squared displacement increased linearly with time and indicated a diffusion constant of 2300 ± 400 nm2 s−1 (Figure 1D). The diffusion was unbiased. Diffusing and nondiffusing beads alike were able to track with disassembly (Figure 1C). These observations demonstrate that the Ndc80 complex forms persistent dynamic attachments to microtubules, allowing filament disassembly to drive movement. Attachments between kinetochores and microtubule tips in vivo withstand tensile forces arising during congression and segregation, but kinetochores lacking the Ndc80 complex fail to establish such attachments (DeLuca et al., 2005DeLuca J.G. Dong Y. Hergert P. Strauss J. Hickey J.M. Salmon E.D. McEwen B.F. Hec1 and nuf2 are core components of the kinetochore outer plate essential for organizing microtubule attachment sites.Mol. Biol.

Molecular analysis of kinetochore-microtubule attachment in budding yeast.Cell. 2001; 106: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To apply force to Ndc80-based linkages in vitro, we used a laser trapping-based force clamp. Constant tension was applied in the direction of microtubule growth with a computer-controlled piezoelectric stage programmed to maintain a fixed offset between the bead and the trap center (Asbury et al., 2006Asbury C.L. Gestaut D.R. Powers A.F. Franck A.D. Davis T.N. The Dam1 kinetochore complex harnesses microtubule dynamics to produce force and movement.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, Franck et al., 2007Franck A.D. Powers A.F. Gestaut D.R. Gonen T. Davis T.N. Asbury C.L. Tension applied through the Dam1 complex promotes microtubule elongation providing a direct mechanism for length control in mitosis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Even with 0.5 to 2.5 pN of continuous tension, the bead-bound Ndc80 complexes maintained an attachment to the filament that persisted through phases of assembly and disassembly and often lasted several minutes (Figure 2 and Table S1). During microtubule growth, the linkages behaved differently under tension than in its absence. Instead of diffusing along the filament or remaining stationary (as in Figure 1), they stayed associated with the growing tip, traveling an average of 670 ± 70 nm before the tip switched spontaneously into rapid shortening (20%, 64 of 314 events) or until movement was interrupted by bead detachment (72%, 226 of 314) or some other event (e.g., the bead sticking to the coverslip or colliding with another bead; 8%, 24 of 314). Many beads remained attached during disassembly (142 events, including 78 that were not preceded by discernable assembly-coupled movement) (see Table S1) and were carried, on average, 1080 ± 140 nm in the direction of filament shortening, against the force of the laser trap (Figure 2E). A few reversed direction when the filament underwent a “rescue,” spontaneously resuming growth (3%, 4 of 142). The remaining beads detached during disassembly (58%, 83 of 142) or were otherwise interrupted (39%, 55 of 142). These results establish that Ndc80 complexes can form load-bearing tip attachments that remain bound during microtubule growth, shortening, catastrophe, and rescue and that the attachments are capable of harnessing energy released during filament disassembly to produce mechanical work. To determine whether the ability to form dynamic, load-bearing tip attachments is conserved in the human Ndc80/Hec1 complex, all four subunits were coexpressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration (Figure S1). As above, a His6 tag on the C terminus of Spc24 was used both for purification and bead binding. Beads coated with the full-length Ndc80/Hec1 complex behaved similarly in force-clamp experiments to those coated with the yeast complex. After attachment to a growing tip and placement under 0.5 to 2.5 pN of tension, the beads often remained tip bound for many minutes through phases of filament growth and shortening (Table S1 and Figure S2A). The mean displacements during filament assembly, 1900 ± 300 nm (n = 46), and disassembly, 970 ± 270 nm (n = 25), and the average duration of attachment, 280 ± 50 s (n = 50), were comparable to those measured for the yeast complex (see Figures S2B–S2D). These results show that the capacity of the Ndc80 complex to couple force to dynamic microtubule tips is conserved from yeast to humans. Kinetochores in vivo contain 6 to 30 copies of the Ndc80 complex per attached microtubule (Emanuele et al., 2005Emanuele M.J. McCleland M.L. Satinover D.L. Stukenberg P.T.

Molecular architecture of the kinetochore-microtubule attachment site is conserved between point and regional centromeres.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To estimate the number of complexes required in vitro for a load-bearing coupler, we measured coupling performance as a function of the surface density of Ndc80 on the beads. Anti-His beads (at 5.6 pM) were incubated with the His6-tagged yeast Ndc80 complex at molar ratios ranging from 110 to 2700 complexes per bead. At each molar ratio, we measured displacements for a population of tip-attached beads subject to 1 pN of continuous tension during microtubule growth and, if possible, during shortening. We also calculated detachment rates for each condition by counting the number of detachment events and dividing by the total observation time. At molar ratios of ∼360 complexes per bead and higher (i.e., ≥ 2 nM Ndc80 complex), we routinely observed tip attachments that persisted for minutes and moved 400 to 1000 nm during growth and shortening (Figure 3A). Below ∼360 complexes per bead, the detachment rate from growing tips increased (Figure 3B), an effect that reduced the distance moved during growth and made measurements during shortening more difficult (because fewer beads remained bound long enough for the filament to undergo catastrophe). Below ∼110 complexes per bead (<0.6 nM Ndc80 complex), microtubule binding still occurred, but the beads detached within a few seconds when placed under tension. These observations suggest a lower bound for the formation of a load-bearing coupler of ∼360 complexes per bead. Simple geometric considerations indicate that Ndc80 complexes on only a small fraction of the bead surface, ≤ 4%, can simultaneously interact with the microtubule (Figure 3C). Assuming a random distribution of complexes on the bead surface, 360 complexes per bead corresponds to 14 ± 5 interacting with the filament. This calculation may overestimate the number of interactions because it assumes (1) that all Ndc80 complexes are functional, (2) that they bind very efficiently to the bead surface, (3) that every bead-bound Ndc80 complex within 40 nm can attach to the filament, and (4) that the bead rests directly against the side of a filament whose tip extends > 120 nm past the point of contact. Relaxing any of these assumptions would lead to a lower estimate. We also note that our estimate includes a relatively large uncertainty (± 33%), arising from the inherent uncertainty in our measurements of bead and protein concentration and from counting statistics (see Supplemental Discussion). Nevertheless, we can conclude that the number of microtubule-interacting Ndc80 complexes required to form a load-bearing coupler in our bead assay is close to the 6 to 30 found at kinetochores in vivo. To study interactions between Ndc80 complexes and microtubules at the level of single molecules, we applied total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (Figure 4). A fluorescent-tagged version of the yeast complex was created by fusing green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the C terminus of Nuf2, a modification that causes no detectable phenotype in vivo (Shimogawa et al., 2006Shimogawa M.M. Graczyk B. Gardner M.K. Francis S.E. White E.A. Ess M. Molk J.N. Ruse C. Niessen S. Yates III, J.R. et al.Mps1 phosphorylation of Dam1 couples kinetochores to microtubule plus ends at metaphase.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1489-1501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). At the low concentrations of free Ndc80 necessary for recording single molecules (i.e., <10 nM), we observed very little binding in a standard microtubule growth buffer. However, in buffers with reduced ionic strength and at an Ndc80-GFP concentration of 20 pM, individual fluorescent particles of Ndc80 complex bound transiently to taxol-stabilized microtubules and underwent one-dimensional diffusion along the filaments (Figure 4B). The brightness of the particles suggested that they were composed of one or two complexes. Most disappeared in a single step, which probably represents detachment from the microtubule (Figure 4C). However, a small fraction showed a stepwise loss of half of their intensity while they remained attached to the filament, consistent with photobleaching of one GFP molecule within a particle containing two. We fit the initial brightness distribution for all of the particles by the sum of two Gaussian functions (Figure 4D), corresponding to a large population (89%) with a unitary brightness of 16,200 ± 5500 arbitrary units (a.u.) and a small population (11%) with twice the brightness (32,400 ± 5500 a.u.). The unitary brightness was similar to that of individual GFP molecules, 17,000 ± 11,000 a.u., measured in control experiments in which GFP-MCAK was bound tightly to microtubules under otherwise identical conditions (data not shown). Sensitivity to ionic strength is a hallmark of protein-protein interactions that rely on electrostatic attraction. To quantify the sensitivity of Ndc80-microtubule interactions to ionic strength, we recorded particle binding and diffusion on taxol-stabilized microtubules across a range of total potassium ion concentrations from 30 to 90 mM (Figure 5). At each potassium ion concentration, we measured association and dissociation rates, kon and koff, and used these values to estimate an equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd = koff·kon−1. Diffusion coefficients were estimated for each condition from linear fits to plots of mean-squared displacement versus time. Raising the ionic strength lowered the association rate (i.e., fewer particles bound) and also increased the dissociation rate (residence times became shorter). As a result, the apparent Kd increased 4-fold, from 0.23 ± 0.02 μM at 30 mM potassium to 0.84 ± 0.12 μM at 90 mM potassium (Figure 5D). These Kd values fall within the range of previous estimates, which vary from 0.04 μM to 3 μM depending on the Ndc80 construct and the buffer composition (Cheeseman et al., 2006Cheeseman I.M.

The knowledge of kinase-substrate relationships has been expanded by both in vitro protein chip analysis (Ptacek et al., 2005Ptacek J. Devgan G. Michaud G. Zhu H. Zhu X. Fasolo J. Guo H. Jona G.

In addition, the integration of context-dependent information (including protein interactions and cell-specific kinase expression) has helped to improve the specificity of phospho-consensus site assignments (Linding et al., 2007Linding R.

Elder K. et al.Systematic discovery of in vivo phosphorylation networks.Cell. 2007; 129: 1415-1426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Despite these achievements, signaling networks have remained difficult to study. While phosphoproteomic datasets illuminate the magnitude and diversity of protein phosphorylation, the functional relevance for the majority of these phosphorylation sites remains unknown (Johnson and Hunter, 2005Johnson S.A. Hunter T. Kinomics: methods for deciphering the kinome.Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Focused studies can elucidate the function of one specific kinase or one particular pathway but often overlook important connections to components that do not directly participate in the pathway. In particular, two hallmarks of kinase signaling are the linear cascades of kinases important for signal amplification and the abundant crosstalk between these pathways in order to coordinate multiple cellular inputs/outputs. Genetic interactions report on the extent to which the function of one gene depends on the presence of a second gene and can illuminate the functional organization of protein networks. Negative genetic interactions (n; synthetic sick/lethal interactions) describe cases where two mutations in combination cause a stronger growth defect than expected from the two single mutations. In contrast, positive genetic interactions (p) correspond to cases where the double mutant is either no sicker (epistatic) or healthier (suppressive) than the sickest single mutant (Figure 1A). Negative genetic interactions are often found for proteins that work in compensatory pathways, while positive interactions can identify pairs of proteins that are in the same complex and/or function in the same pathway (Collins et al., 2007bCollins S.R.

SSL interactions, however, only represent a subset of the full epistatic interaction spectrum. Our interest in mapping the pathway architectures involved in phosphate-based signaling led us to use an SGA-based methodology that measures the entire range of epistatic relationships, termed epistatic miniarray profile (or E-MAP) (Figure 1A) (Collins et al., 2006Collins S.R.

Cell. 2008; 32: 735-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The E-MAP method does not rely on the detection of individual phosphoproteins, but it rather provides the functional connections between signaling molecules, whether these are direct or indirect. In addition, genetic interactions are not limited to the detection of proteins in physical contact and are thus particularly useful in identifying more transient interactions and those controlled by posttranslational modification. Here we use our E-MAP approach to provide an unbiased, genetic overview of the functional connections within the signaling machinery. An E-MAP quantitatively records genetic interactions between pairs of mutations for a defined subset of genes. The data are generated by systematically constructing double mutant strains, measuring their growth rates, and converting this information to individual genetic interaction scores, both positive and negative (Collins et al., 2006Collins S.R.

To explore the signaling apparatus of S. cerevisiae, our genetic approach targeted almost all known protein kinases (121) and phosphatases (38) and their regulatory proteins (45 and 39, respectively), as well as non-protein kinases (47) and phosphatases (38) (Figure 1B, Table S1 available online). To include those components of the signaling machinery that are essential for viability, we employed the DAmP (decreased abundance by mRNA perturbation) strategy to create 48 hypomorphic alleles. This method relies on the insertion of an antibiotic-resistance marker to disrupt the natural 3′UTR, which leads to destabilization of the mRNA transcripts and, subsequently, lowered protein levels (Schuldiner et al., 2005Schuldiner M. Collins S.R. Thompson N.J. Denic V. Bhamidipati A. Punna T. Ihmels J. Andrews B. Boone C. Greenblatt J.F. et al.Exploration of the function and organization of the yeast early secretory pathway through an epistatic miniarray profile.Cell. 2005; 123: 507-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). In all, the signaling E-MAP contains 483 genes, including 135 genes that serve as reporters of a variety of major biological processes (Figure 1B, Table S1). We comprehensively evaluated the pairwise genetic interactions of these 483 alleles, resulting in approximately 100,000 distinct, pairwise genetic interaction measurements (Figure S1, Table S2). All data are available at http://interactome-cmp.ucsf.edu in an interactive and searchable format. To evaluate the genetic interaction data, we first examined how the data recapitulated known phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events. To this end, we manually curated from the literature the majority of well-characterized kinase- and phosphatase-substrate relationships (654 and 141, respectively) (Figures 2A and S2, Table S3). Of these 795 pairwise connections, our E-MAP contained data for 252 (32%) of them (Table S4). We analyzed the genetic interaction patterns for different subsets of the manually curated set of known phosphorylation events: kinases and their substrates, phosphatases and their substrates, two kinases that share the same substrate, two phosphatases that share the same substrate, and kinase-phosphatase pairs that target a common substrate (Figure 2B, Tables S4 and S5). As a metric to describe the trends within these different subsets, we employed a ratio of highly positive (S ≥ 2.0) to negative (S ≤ −2.5) genetic interactions (p to n ratio) (S = genetic interaction score). Importantly, the relative ratios obtained for the different subsets were independent of the thresholds used to define the positive and negative genetic interactions (data not shown). The E-MAP data revealed a significant enrichment of positive genetic interactions for known kinase- and phosphatase-substrate pairs. While the E-MAP as a whole displayed a p to n ratio of 0.53, this ratio was almost inverted for characterized kinase- and phosphatase-substrate relationships (p to n ratio: 1.78; p value = 1.8 × 10−3) (Figure 2B, Tables S1–S5). For example, we detected positive genetic interactions between the CAK1 kinase and two of its substrates, CTK1 and SMK1 (Figure 2A, 1) (Ostapenko and Solomon, 2005Ostapenko D. Solomon M.J. Phosphorylation by Cak1 regulates the C-terminal domain kinase Ctk1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3906-3913Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, Schaber et al., 2002Schaber M. Lindgren A. Schindler K. Bungard D. Kaldis P. Winter E. CAK1 promotes meiosis and spore formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a CDC28-independent fashion.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These trends might be rationalized as follows: if the phosphorylated form of a substrate is important for cell growth, then either mutation of the substrate or loss of its phosphorylation through mutation of the cognate kinase will result in impaired cell growth. Once the kinase has been deleted (and the level of substrate phosphorylation has decreased), additional deletion of the substrate will result in a less severe growth defect than expected from the two single mutations, thus giving rise to a positive genetic interaction. Similar logic can be applied to phosphatase-substrate relationships that display positive genetic interactions (e.g., SIT4-GCN2 [Cherkasova and Hinnebusch, 2003Cherkasova V.A. Hinnebusch A.G. Translational control by TOR and TAP42 through dephosphorylation of eIF2alpha kinase GCN2.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 859-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar] or SIT4-SAP155 [Luke et al., 1996Luke M.M. Della Seta F. Di Como C.J. Sugimoto H. Kobayashi R. Arndt K.T. The SAP, a new family of proteins, associate and function positively with the SIT4 phosphatase.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2744-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar], Figure 2A, 2) if the dephosphorylated form of a substrate is important for cell growth. Conversely, pairs of kinases (or phosphatases) that act on the same substrate can display negative interactions between themselves if they are partially or completely redundant. Indeed, we observed an enrichment of negative genetic interactions in these cases (p to n ratio: 0.21; p value = 2.5 × 10−3) (Figure 2B, Table S5), including a negative interaction between the CLA4 and STE20 kinases, both of which phosphorylate Myo3 (Wu et al., 1997Wu C. Lytvyn V. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. The phosphorylation site for Ste20p-like protein kinases is essential for the function of myosin-I in yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30623-30626Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and between PPH21 and PPH22, duplicated PP2A phosphatase family members known to act redundantly on a number of different substrates (Figure 2A, box 3 and box 4) (Oficjalska-Pham et al., 2006Oficjalska-Pham D.

Cell. 2006; 22: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The most striking p to n ratio was observed for kinase-phosphatase pairs that target a common substrate. These pairs of counterbalancing enzymes proved to be much more likely to display positive genetic interactions (p to n ratio: 5.5; p value = 2.8 × 10−3) (Figure 2B, Table S5). For example, a positive genetic interaction was observed between deletions of the SNF1 kinase and the phosphatase SIT4, both of which regulate the phosphorylation status of the Gln3 transcription factor (Figure 2A, box 5) (Bertram et al., 2002Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Chan T.-F. Ai W. Zheng X.F.S. Convergence of TOR-nitrogen and Snf1-glucose signaling pathways onto Gln3.Mol. Cell.

In these cases, if optimal cell growth requires a substrate to maintain a particular level of phosphorylation, then mutation of its phosphatase (or kinase) will perturb the steady-state phosphorylation levels, resulting in a growth phenotype. By additionally deleting the counterbalancing kinase (or phosphatase), wild-type phosphorylation levels may be restored, and the growth defect may be suppressed. We therefore contend that this quantitative genetic platform can be used to identify kinase-substrate pairs, phosphatase-substrate pairs, and kinase pairs, phosphatase pairs, and kinase-phosphatase pairs that share a common substrate (see Tables S2 and S6 for complete list of genetic interactions). While we found a significant enrichment of positive interactions within the set of kinase-substrate, phosphatase-substrate, and kinase-phosphatase pairs that share a common substrate, many of the literature-curated relationships were not captured by our genetic analysis (Table S5). There are several reasons why we would not expect a perfect correlation between these two datasets. First, many signaling pathways are only fully activated in response to a particular stimulus (e.g., high salt/Hog1). Since our genetic interaction screen was carried out under standard growth conditions, most pathways were only operating at basal levels. As a result, their perturbation may not yield a significant growth phenotype. Generating E-MAP data under a number of different stresses would help detect many of these stimulus-specific genetic interactions. Second, there are many duplicated copies of kinases or phosphatases that exist in the yeast genome (e.g., MKK1 and MKK2), and this redundancy can mask potential genetic interactions. In these cases, triple mutants could provide richer interaction profiles and help identify additional connections. Despite these limitations, we detected a significant number of genetic interactions that correlated with previously described network connections, illustrating the predictive power of this dataset. To investigate the characteristics of genetic interactions among components of the signaling apparatus, we analyzed the p to n ratio among and between the protein kinases and phosphatases. Compared to previous datasets, including an E-MAP of chromosome function (Collins et al., 2007bCollins S.R. Miller K.M. Maas N.L. Roguev A. Fillingham J. Chu C.S. Schuldiner M. Gebbia M. Recht J. Shales M. et al.Functional dissection of protein complexes involved in yeast chromosome biology using a genetic interaction map.Nature. 2007; 446: 806-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) that had a p to n ratio of 0.49, we found that there was a large enrichment of positive genetic interactions within the set of protein kinases and protein phosphatases (K versus K/P versus P) (p to n ratio: 0.78; p value = 1.0 × 10−3) and between protein kinases and protein phosphatases (K versus P) (p to n ratio: 0.87; p value = 5.1 × 10−3) (Figures 2B and S3, Table S5). The trend toward positive genetic interactions could stem from the fact that kinases and phosphatases often work together in linear pathways. To test the predictive power of the E-MAP data, we examined the positive genetic interactions we identified with the histone H2A variant, HTZ1. Htz1 is incorporated into chromatin by the SWR-C chromatin-remodeling complex (Korber and Horz, 2004Korber P. Horz W. SWRred not shaken; mixing the histones.Cell. 2004; 117: 5-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and is subsequently acetylated on its amino terminus by the histone acetyltransferase, NuA4 (Babiarz et al., 2006Babiarz J.E. Halley J.E. Rine J.

Grunstein M. Acetylation of H2AZ lys 14 is associated with genome-wide gene activity in yeast.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, HTZ1 displayed positive genetic interactions with SWR1 (+3.5), the catalytic subunit of SWR-C, as well as with VPS71 (+3.9) and VPS72 (+3.5), two other components of the complex (Figure 3A). Significant positive interactions were also observed with other factors not previously known to function with Htz1. These included Bud14, a regulatory subunit for the phosphatase Glc7 (Cullen and Sprague, 2002Cullen P.J. Sprague Jr., G.F. The Glc7p-interacting protein Bud14p attenuates polarized growth, pheromone response, and filamentous growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 884-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and Clb2, a B-type cyclin that regulates Cdc28 (CDK) activity (Cullen and Sprague, 2002Cullen P.J. Sprague Jr., G.F.

Microbiol. 2001; 4: 720-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). Deletion of either BUD14 or CLB2 resulted in a marked decrease in Htz1 lysine 14 acetylation (Htz1-K14Ac; Figure 3B), indicating that these proteins impinge on the abundance of a chromatin-associated form of this histone variant (Keogh et al., 2006bKeogh M.-C. Mennella T.A. Sawa C. Berthelet S. Krogan N.J. Wolek A. Podolny V. Carpenter L.R. Greenblatt J.F. Baetz K. Buratowski S. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae histone H2A variant Htz1 is acetylated by NuA4.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Fractionation experiments determined that deletion of BUD14 resulted in almost a 3-fold decrease in nuclear Htz1, which correlated with the decrease (∼4-fold) in the K14-acetylated form of the histone (Figure 3C). The Bud14-associated phosphatase Glc7 has been shown to impinge on chromatin structure by dephosphorylating serine 10 of histone H3, a mark linked to chromosome transmission (Hsu et al., 2000Hsu J.-Y. Sun Z.-W. Li X. Reuben M. Tatchell K. Bishop D.K. Grushcow J.M. Brame C.J. Caldwell J.A. Hunt D.F. et al.Mitotic phosphorylation of histone H3 is governed by Ipl1/aurora kinase and Glc7/PP1 phosphatase in budding yeast and nematodes.Cell. 2000; 102: 279-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Therefore, Glc7/Bud14 may regulate Htz1 incorporation by SWR-C into chromatin, either directly or indirectly, potentially through histone H3 (Figure 3D). Conversely, the effect of clb2Δ was primarily seen at the level of Htz1 acetylation. Here the levels of nuclear Htz1 were unperturbed by deletion of CLB2, but Htz1-K14Ac was decreased 3-fold (Figure 3C). This implies that Clb2 exerts a regulatory function on NuA4, the enzyme complex that adds this acetylation mark (Figure 3D). An independent study determined that Yng2, a component of NuA4 required for its histone acetyltransferase activity (Krogan et al., 2004Krogan N.J. Baetz K. Keogh M.-C. Datta N. Sawa C. Kwok T.C.Y. Thompson N.J. Davey M.G. Pootoolal J. Hughes T.R. et al.Regulation of chromosome stability by the histone H2A variant Htz1, the Swr1 chromatin remodeling complex, and the histone acetyltransferase NuA4.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 13513-13518Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), is a target of Clb2-dependent Cdc28 phosphorylation on two consensus CDK sites (T185 and S188) (L. Holt, J. Villen, S. Gygi, and D. Morgan, personal communication). This connection is also in agreement with previous reports that suggested that Htz1 function is cell cycle regulated (Dhillon et al., 2006Dhillon N.

Although further work will be required to resolve the mechanistic details of Htz1 regulation, these data confirm the predictive power of individual positive genetic interactions from the E-MAP. We next explored how the genetic interactions mapped within signaling cascades, involving multiple kinases"
https://openalex.org/W2003816645,"Skeletal muscle satellite cells, located between the basal lamina and plasma membrane of myofibers, are required for skeletal muscle regeneration. The capacity of satellite cells as well as other cell lineages including mesoangioblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, and side population (SP) cells to contribute to muscle regeneration has complicated the identification of a satellite stem cell. We have characterized a rare subset of the muscle SP that efficiently engrafts into the host satellite cell niche when transplanted into regenerating muscle, providing 75% of the satellite cell population and 30% of the myonuclear population, respectively. These cells are found in the satellite cell position, adhere to isolated myofibers, and spontaneously undergo myogenesis in culture. We propose that this subset of SP cells (satellite-SP cells), characterized by ABCG2, Syndecan-4, and Pax7 expression, constitutes a self-renewing muscle stem cell capable of generating both satellite cells and their myonuclear progeny in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2130801271,"TRIM-NHL proteins represent a large class of metazoan proteins implicated in development and disease. We demonstrate that a C. elegans TRIM-NHL protein, NHL-2, functions as a cofactor for the microRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) and thereby enhances the posttranscriptional repression of several genetically verified microRNA targets, including hbl-1 and let-60/Ras (by the let-7 family of microRNAs) and cog-1 (by the lsy-6 microRNA). NHL-2 is localized to cytoplasmic P-bodies and physically associates with the P-body protein CGH-1 and the core miRISC components ALG-1/2 and AIN-1. nhl-2 and cgh-1 mutations compromise the repression of microRNA targets in vivo but do not affect microRNA biogenesis, indicating a role for an NHL-2:CGH-1 complex in the effector phase of miRISC activity. We propose that the NHL-2:CGH-1 complex functions in association with mature miRISC to modulate the efficacy of microRNA:target interactions in response to physiological and developmental signals, thereby ensuring the robustness of genetic regulatory pathways regulated by microRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2117858129,"Background Previous studies have extensively documented antimicrobial and chemotactic activities of beta-defensins. Human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) is strongly expressed in lesional psoriatic epidermis, and recently we have shown that high beta-defensin genomic copy number is associated with psoriasis susceptibility. It is not known, however, if biologically and pathophysiologically relevant concentrations of hBD-2 protein are present in vivo, which could support an antimicrobial and proinflammatory role of beta-defensins in lesional psoriatic epidermis. Methodology/Principal Findings We found that systemic levels of hBD-2 showed a weak but significant correlation with beta defensin copy number in healthy controls but not in psoriasis patients with active disease. In psoriasis patients but not in atopic dermatitis patients, we found high systemic hBD-2 levels that strongly correlated with disease activity as assessed by the PASI score. Our findings suggest that systemic levels in psoriasis are largely determined by secretion from involved skin and not by genomic copy number. Modelling of the in vivo epidermal hBD-2 concentration based on the secretion rate in a reconstructed skin model for psoriatic epidermis provides evidence that epidermal hBD-2 levels in vivo are probably well above the concentrations required for in vitro antimicrobial and chemokine-like effects. Conclusions/Significance Serum hBD-2 appears to be a useful surrogate marker for disease activity in psoriasis. The discrepancy between hBD-2 levels in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis could explain the well known differences in infection rate between these two diseases."

In this commentary, underlying points of contention are described with the aim of defining focal points for discussion and future consideration. While a broad range of expertise has recently come to bear on the intriguing topic of “cancer stem cells,” the overall relevance of stem cells as they relate to cancer remains in dispute. In this commentary, underlying points of contention are described with the aim of defining focal points for discussion and future consideration. To many investigators, the field of cancer stem cells (CSCs) must seem very confusing. If one reads the literature or attends various scientific meetings, the views expressed on this topic run an amazingly broad gamut. On one side there are individuals who contend the discovery of CSCs is huge step toward ultimately curing cancer, and that understanding such cells is tremendously important. Conversely, others actually question the existence of CSC, and argue that the relative importance of the putative population is negligible. Even among proponents of the concept, the ultimate message conveyed is often unclear. Indeed, in listening to experts in the field, one often hears phrases like “If the cancer stem cell hypothesis is true, then….” With such a diversity of opinion, one might imagine that some hugely controversial or complex data sets have led investigators to propose widely varying interpretations. However, while there is certainly some debate over the utility of various experimental methods, I would suggest the disparities present in the field are largely a consequence of misunderstanding and confusion. Unfortunately, this confusion tends to distract and possibly dissuade investigators from pursuing questions facing the field, whereas addressing these issues head on might further the development of better cancer therapies. Below are described some central points of misunderstanding, as I see them, as well as concepts not widely appreciated by different facets of the scientific community. In early 2006, the AACR convened a working group of both stem cell and non-stem cell experts to talk about CSCs (Clarke et al., 2006Clarke M.F. Dick J.E. Dirks P.B. Eaves C.J. Jamieson C.H. Jones D.L. Visvader J. Weissman I.L. Wahl G.M. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9339-9344Crossref PubMed Scopus (2363) Google Scholar). One session of the meeting was specifically devoted to the issue of nomenclature. While many different ideas were discussed, in the end, it was decided that the term “cancer stem cells,” was the most scientifically accurate label to refer to a malignant cell that fulfilled the classic stem cell criteria (i.e., the ability to undergo self-renewal and the developmental potential to recapitulate all the cell types found in a given tissue). In retrospect, although the rationale for this decision was valid and well intended, I think we failed to appreciate how confusing the term might be for the broader scientific community. A common misperception that continues to pervade both oral and written discussions is that a cell labeled as a “cancer stem cell” must have arisen from a normal stem cell. In fact, this is not the case, and was never the intention of the adopted nomenclature. Stem cells, in the true sense of the word, are defined solely by their functional properties, and thus, the application of that label does not reflect the derivation of the cell or imply a normal cell of origin. So, although normal stem cells may give rise to CSC in some cases, this ancestry cannot be inferred purely from the nomenclature. Unfortunately, despite the attempts of numerous articles to clarify this issue, it remains a huge point of confusion. The main ramification of this misconception is the notion that if a CSC arises from anything other than a normal stem cell, the resulting tumor-forming cell can't be considered a true stem cell, thereby negating the CSC as a valid entity. This circular logic, while entirely understandable, must be avoided. The take-home lesson is simple: if any given cell, malignant or otherwise, fulfills the functional criteria stated above, then that cell should be considered a true stem cell. Applying this rule to cancer, the result is unambiguous and clear—CSCs exist for multiple forms of cancer. Indeed, a single cell giving rise to a metastatic lesion is, by definition, a “true” cancer stem cell in that it must have undergone self-renewal and is capable of recapitulating the entire tumor population. The origin of such a cell need not necessarily be a normal stem cell, an observation that has become increasingly clear from experimental cancer models (Krivtsov et al., 2006Krivtsov A.V. Twomey D. Feng Z. Stubbs M.C. Wang Y. Faber J. Levine J.E. Wang J. Hahn W.C. Gilliland D.G. et al.Nature. 2006; 442: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). A second area of confusion relates to assumptions regarding the nature of CSC properties. This problem tends to arise from the same misconception outlined above. In this case, the flawed inference is to propose that CSCs will exhibit all qualitative and quantitative traits present in normal systems, a view that often follows from the notion that CSCs derive from normal stem cells. For example, most normal stem cell systems behave according to relatively well-conserved and predictable rules, which typically include a hierarchical developmental process (i.e., a defined “parent-to-progeny” relationship). Features such as stem cell immunophenotype, frequency, response to extrinsic stimuli, etc., are reliably maintained among individuals in a given species. Indeed, at steady state, the size of a particular stem cell compartment does not generally vary much within defined lineages. However, increasing evidence indicates that these common properties may not be maintained in the context of cancer. That is to say, the relative frequency of CSC, their cell surface immunophenotype, and various other biological properties may not be stable during the course of disease progression or in cross-comparing patients with the same disease. For example, studies to estimate the prevalence of leukemia stem cells demonstrated a 500-fold range in multiple independent specimens (Bonnet and Dick, 1997Bonnet D. Dick J.E. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (5119) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the size of the CSC compartment can be highly variable. In addition, analysis of leukemia populations with respect to cell surface markers associated with a primitive phenotype showed dramatic variability from patient to patient (Taussig et al., 2008Taussig D.C. Miraki-Moud F. Anjos-Afonso F. Pearce D.J. Allen K. Ridler C. Lillington D. Oakervee H. Cavenagh J. Agrawal S.G. et al.Blood. 2008; 112: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Given this potential heterogeneity of surface markers, it is important to refrain from being overly rigid in attaching the label of CSCs to a population solely by virtue of phenotypic traits. As described above, stem cells are defined by their functionality, and the mere expression of a feature exhibited by known stem cell populations does not indicate that cancer stem cells are present in that tumor or tissue. Furthermore, any given type of CSCs may present a range of antigens commonly associated with primitive cells, but the specific expression pattern may vary from patient to patient. If so, then the properties of CSCs must be empirically determined for each patient. Notably, this exact scenario has been observed in leukemia studies that identified residual drug-resistant populations that contribute to relapse (Feller et al., 2004Feller N. van der Pol M.A. van Stijn A. Weijers G.W. Westra A.H. Evertse B.W. Ossenkoppele G.J. Schuurhuis G.J. Leukemia. 2004; 18: 1380-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although not yet well described by experimental studies, it is also tempting to speculate that CSCs are relatively low-frequency in early stages of tumorigenesis but, during the course of pathogenesis, become an increasingly prevalent (or perhaps even dominant) component of the tumor population. If true, one would predict that the most aggressive or advanced forms of cancer would show the highest proportion of CSCs. Notably, recent studies of human melanoma indicate that in some types of cancer, advanced tumors are composed of a very high proportion of cells functionally defined as CSC (Quintana et al., 2008Quintana E. Shackleton M. Sabel M.S. Fullen D.R. Johnson T.M. Morrison S.J. Nature. 2008; 456: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). If, indeed, the orderly and well-characterized developmental structure of normal stem cell systems is not maintained in the context of cancer, then the practical ramifications are profound. If CSC phenotype, frequency, and biological properties are in flux in an individual patient during disease progression, then characterization of such cells is vastly more difficult. Moreover, the lack of consistent biological features will inevitably lead to controversy and confusion, a phenomenon that appears to be increasingly evident for the CSC field. Given the concepts outlined above, it appears that debating the existence of CSCs or their frequency is not a particularly useful exercise, and the scientific community would be well served to move beyond these issues. Rather, the more pertinent question is whether studying and targeting CSC is important for developing better forms of therapy. The answer to that query seems somewhat less clear. On the one hand, if the rules of CSC behavior closely mimic the development paradigms found in normal stem cell systems, then it would seem obvious that one must eradicate CSCs to permanently and completely destroy a tumor. In other words, to paraphrase a popular analogy, if you kill the dandelion at its root rather than just mowing it down, it can't grow back. However, if normal developmental processes are not sufficiently preserved in cancer, then targeting CSC may not be the panacea we might hope it would be. In order for directed CSC eradication to be strongly efficacious, the CSC population must be relatively stable. In other words, if the genetic, epigenetic, or cellular properties of CSC demonstrate significant plasticity, either as a function of tumor progression and/or therapeutic challenge, then one is faced with exactly the same problems encountered for decades in treating bulk tumor populations, i.e., emergence of drug resistance and selection of increasingly refractory cell types. Similarly, if the stem cell “state” is transitory or actually induced as a function of the local microenvironment (Adams and Strasser, 2008Adams J.M. Strasser A. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 4018-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), then of course, chasing strategies that target stem cells may also be unsuccessful. Given these challenges, it is easy to argue that pursuit of CSC targeting is essentially a red herring and no more than the latest in series of overhyped trends. However, I would suggest that certain aspects of stem cell biology are actually quite useful toward advancing tumor therapy. While phenotype and frequency may not be consistent, other properties of normal stem cells hold the potential to be extremely important when applied to clinical interventions. For example, the most central feature of stem cells is self-renewal, which also appears to be an intrinsic property of “successful” tumors. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms by which CSCs regulate self-renewal responses and subsequent design of therapies that selectively target self-renewal pathways remain intriguing lines of investigation. Indeed, recent studies aimed at inhibition of known self-renewal pathways such as Wnt and Hedgehog have shown promising results (Jamieson et al., 2004Jamieson C.H. Ailles L.E. Dylla S.J. Muijtjens M. Jones C. Zehnder J.L. Gotlib J. Li K. Manz M.G. Keating A. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 351: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar, Peacock et al., 2007Peacock C.D. Wang Q. Gesell G.S. Corcoran-Schwartz I.M. Jones E. Kim J. Devereux W.L. Rhodes J.T. Huff C.A. Beachy P.A. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 4048-4053Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and appear likely to warrant clinical testing. Another inherent property of normal stem cells with potential clinical relevance is their natural resistance to xenobiotic toxins (the source of several forms of chemotherapy), by virtue of increased expression of membrane efflux pumps (e.g., MDR, ABC transporters, etc.). Notably, this trait has been observed in many forms of cancer and targeting transporter machinery has been the basis for studies on so-called “drug resistance” inhibitors. While agents of this class have been widely investigated, they have never been evaluated with respect to targeting CSC. Thus, one might imagine a renewed interest in drugs of this class if sufficient specificity to CSC can be demonstrated. Other examples of stem cell biology that may be relevant to CSCs are the mechanisms by which stem cells regulate properties like DNA repair (Bao et al., 2006Bao S. Wu Q. McLendon R.E. Hao Y. Shi Q.

Bossi D. Ronchini C. Ronzoni S. Muradore I. Monestiroli S. et al.Nature. 2009; 457: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), oxidative state (Guzman et al., 2005Guzman M.L. Rossi R.M. Karnischky L. Li X. Peterson D.R. Howard D.S. Jordan C.T. Blood. 2005; 105: 4163-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), and prosurvival pathways such as NF-κB or PI3 kinase (Guzman et al., 2005Guzman M.L. Rossi R.M. Karnischky L. Li X.

Blood. 2003; 102: 972-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In summary, I would contend that dissent regarding the existence of cancer stem cells, while not surprising, actually represents more of a misunderstanding than true controversy. Functionally defined CSCs certainly do exist in many forms of cancer, irrespective of their relative frequency or the stability of CSC phenotype. Going forward, the real issue will be to define whether or not understanding the properties of CSCs has value toward creating improved therapeutic strategies. In my view, the evidence to date supports the concept that better therapies will arise as a consequence of targeting CSCs. However, it is important to note that definitive clinical proof of the effectiveness of this approach has yet to be achieved. Indeed, the concept must be considered speculative until such time as a direct link between CSC eradication and clinical benefit is demonstrated. Therefore, in the near term, I suggest the key challenges are 3-fold. First, as a field, we must uncover the developmental biology of tumors arising from CSCs and address the critical issue of when and if a parent-progeny relationship exists for a given tumor type. If a relatively rare CSC is evident and responsible for generating a bulk tumor population (e.g., chronic myelogenous leukemia), then therapies that directly target CSCs may be useful. If tumors do not maintain a hierarchical development structure, then it may be more important to focus on those stem-like properties most relevant to tumor propagation, such as self-renewal, drug resistance, etc. Second, adequate experimental systems must be established, and fully vetted, in order to perform convincing functional analyses of CSCs isolated from primary tumors. An indisputable tenet of stem cell biology is that all stem cells, be they normal or malignant, can only be rigorously defined using functional assays. To achieve this second goal, existing in vitro surrogate and/or xenograft assays must be further refined in order to maximize their relevance for the characterization of human CSC candidates. Third, and perhaps most importantly, the clinical endpoints by which putative therapies are evaluated must be revised such that the role of CSC in pathogenesis and drug response can be assessed (Wang, 2007Wang J.C. Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 497-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (49) Google Scholar). By addressing these central issues, it should be possible to better understand the role of CSCs in cancer biology and to unambiguously determine their potential with regard to achieving better therapeutic outcomes.

https://openalex.org/W2063743804,"Initiation of eukaryotic DNA synthesis occurs at origins of replication that are utilized with characteristic times and frequencies during S phase. We have investigated origin usage by evaluating the kinetics of replication factor binding in fission yeast and show that similar to metazoa, ORC binding is periodic during the cell cycle, increasing during mitosis and peaking at M/G1. At an origin, the timing of ORC binding in M and pre-RC assembly in G1 correlates with the timing of firing during S, and the level of pre-IC formation reflects origin efficiency. Extending mitosis allows ORC to become more equally associated with origins and leads to genome-wide changes in origin usage, while overproduction of pre-IC factors increases replication of both efficient and inefficient origins. We propose that differential recruitment of ORC to origins during mitosis followed by competition among origins for limiting replication factors establishes the timing and efficiency of origin firing."
https://openalex.org/W1968855455,"Outbred laboratory mouse populations are widely used in biomedical research. Since little is known about the degree of genetic variation present in these populations, they are not widely used for genetic studies. Commercially available outbred CD-1 mice are drawn from an extremely large breeding population that has accumulated many recombination events, which is desirable for genome-wide association studies. We therefore examined the degree of genome-wide variation within CD-1 mice to investigate their suitability for genetic studies. The CD-1 mouse genome displays patterns of linkage disequilibrium and heterogeneity similar to wild-caught mice. Population substructure and phenotypic differences were observed among CD-1 mice obtained from different breeding facilities. Differences in genetic variation among CD-1 mice from distinct facilities were similar to genetic differences detected between closely related human populations, consistent with a founder effect. This first large-scale genetic analysis of the outbred CD-1 mouse strain provides important considerations for the design and analysis of genetic studies in CD-1 mice."
https://openalex.org/W2041886674,"Glyoxalase 1 (Glo1) has been implicated in anxiety-like behavior in mice and in multiple psychiatric diseases in humans. We used mouse Affymetrix exon arrays to detect copy number variants (CNV) among inbred mouse strains and thereby identified a ∼475 kb tandem duplication on chromosome 17 that includes Glo1 (30,174,390–30,651,226 Mb; mouse genome build 36). We developed a PCR-based strategy and used it to detect this duplication in 23 of 71 inbred strains tested, and in various outbred and wild-caught mice. Presence of the duplication is associated with a cis-acting expression QTL for Glo1 (LOD>30) in BXD recombinant inbred strains. However, evidence for an eQTL for Glo1 was not obtained when we analyzed single SNPs or 3-SNP haplotypes in a panel of 27 inbred strains. We conclude that association analysis in the inbred strain panel failed to detect an eQTL because the duplication was present on multiple highly divergent haplotypes. Furthermore, we suggest that non-allelic homologous recombination has led to multiple reversions to the non-duplicated state among inbred strains. We show associations between multiple duplication-containing haplotypes, Glo1 expression and anxiety-like behavior in both inbred strain panels and outbred CD-1 mice. Our findings provide a molecular basis for differential expression of Glo1 and further implicate Glo1 in anxiety-like behavior. More broadly, these results identify problems with commonly employed tests for association in inbred strains when CNVs are present. Finally, these data provide an example of biologically significant phenotypic variability in model organisms that can be attributed to CNVs."

Here we show that these populations of neural crest-derived stem cells (NCSCs) are differentially regulated by small Rho GTPases. Deletion of either Cdc42 or Rac1 in the NC results in size reduction of multiple NC target structures because of increased cell-cycle exit, while NC cells emigrating from the neural tube are not affected. Consistently, Cdc42 or Rac1 inactivation reduces self-renewal and proliferation of later stage, but not early migratory NCSCs. This stage-specific requirement for small Rho GTPases is due to changes in NCSCs that, during development, acquire responsiveness to mitogenic EGF acting upstream of both Cdc42 and Rac1. Thus, our data reveal distinct mechanisms for growth control of NCSCs from different developmental stages."
https://openalex.org/W2015567417,"During human development, signals that govern lineage specification versus expansion of cells committed to a cell fate are poorly understood. We demonstrate that activation of canonical Wnt signaling by Wnt3a promotes proliferation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)—precursors already committed to the hematopoietic lineage. In contrast, noncanonical Wnt signals, activated by Wnt11, control exit from the pluripotent state and entry toward mesoderm specification. Unique to embryoid body (EB) formation of hESCs, Wnt11 induces development and arrangement of cells expressing Brachyury that coexpress E-cadherin and Frizzled-7 (Fzd7). Knockdown of Fzd7 expression blocks Wnt11-dependent specification. Our study reveals an unappreciated role for noncanonical Wnt signaling in hESC specification that involves development of unique mesoderm precursors via morphogenic organization within human EBs."

https://openalex.org/W2072445382,"Background Alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) plays a central role in generating complex proteomes and influences development and disease. However, the regulation and etiology of AS in human tumorigenesis is not well understood. Methodology/Principal Findings A Basic Local Alignment Search Tool database was constructed for the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from all available databases of human cancer and normal tissues. An insertion or deletion in the alignment of EST/EST was used to identify alternatively spliced transcripts. Alignment of the ESTs with the genomic sequence was further used to confirm AS. Alternatively spliced transcripts in each tissue were then subtractively cross-screened to obtain tissue-specific variants. We systematically identified and characterized cancer/tissue-specific and alternatively spliced variants in the human genome based on a global view. We identified 15,093 cancer-specific variants of 9,989 genes from 27 types of human cancers and 14,376 normal tissue-specific variants of 7,240 genes from 35 normal tissues, which cover the main types of human tumors and normal tissues. Approximately 70% of these transcripts are novel. These data were integrated into a database HCSAS (http://202.114.72.39/database/human.html, pass:68756253). Moreover, we observed that the cancer-specific AS of both oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are associated with specific cancer types. Cancer shows a preference in the selection of alternative splice-sites and utilization of alternative splicing types. Conclusions/Significance These features of human cancer, together with the discovery of huge numbers of novel splice forms for cancer-associated genes, suggest an important and global role of cancer-specific AS during human tumorigenesis. We advise the use of cancer-specific alternative splicing as a potential source of new diagnostic, prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic tools for human cancer. The global view of cancer-specific AS is not only useful for exploring the complexity of the cancer transcriptome but also widens the eyeshot of clinical research."
https://openalex.org/W2007712506,"A recent trial unexpectedly reported that atrial fibrillation, when defined as serious, occurred more often in participants randomized to an annual infusion of the relatively new parenteral bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid, than among those given placebo, but had limited power. Two subsequent population-based case-control studies of patients receiving a more established oral bisphosphonate, alendronic acid, reported conflicting results, possibly due to uncontrolled confounding factors.We used the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database to assess the risk of atrial fibrillation and flutter in women exposed to the oral bisphosphonates, alendronic acid and risedronate sodium. The self-controlled case-series method was used to minimise the potential for confounding. The age-adjusted incidence rate ratio for atrial fibrillation or flutter in individuals during their exposure to these oral bisphosphonates (n = 2195) was 1.07 (95% CI 0.94-1.21). The age-adjusted incidence rate ratio for alendronic acid (n = 1489) and risedronate sodium (n = 649) exposed individuals were 1.09 (95% CI 0.93-1.26) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.78-1.26) respectively. In post-hoc analyses, an increased risk of incident atrial fibrillation or flutter was detected for patients during their first few months of alendronic acid therapy.We found no robust evidence of an overall long-term increased risk of atrial fibrillation or flutter associated with continued exposure to the oral bisphosphonates, alendronic acid and risedronate sodium. A possible signal for an increase in risk during the first few months of therapy with alendronic acid needs to be re-assessed in additional studies."
https://openalex.org/W1985265486,"The efficacy of oxaliplatin in cancer chemotherapy is limited by the development of drug resistance. MMP7 has been related to the loss of tumor cell response to cytotoxic agents although the exact mechanism is not fully understood. Moreover, MMP7 is an independent prognosis factor for survival in patients with colorectal cancer. The aim of the present study was to analyze the role of MMP7 and its cross-talk with the Fas/FasL system during the acquisition of oxaliplatin resistance in colon cancer cells.For this purpose we have developed three different oxaliplatin-resistant cell lines (RHT29, RHCT116 p53(+/+), RHCT116 p53(-/-)) from the parental HT29, HCT116 p53(+/+) and HCT116 p53(-/-) colon cancer cells. MMP7 basal expression was higher in the resistant compared to the parental cell lines. MMP7 was also upregulated by oxaliplatin in both HT29 (p53 mutant) and RHCT116 p53(-/-) but not in the RHCT116 p53(+/+). Inhibition of MMP by 1,10-phenantroline monohydrate or siRNA of MMP7 restores cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis in both HT29 and RHCT116 p53(-/-) but not in the RHCT116 p53(+/+). Some of these effects are caused by alterations in Fas receptor. Fas is upregulated by oxaliplatin in colon cancer cells, however the RHT29 cells treated with oxaliplatin showed a 3.8-fold lower Fas expression at the cell surface than the HT29 cells. Decrease of Fas at the plasma membrane seems to be caused by MMP7 since its inhibition restores Fas levels. Moreover, functional analysis of Fas demonstrates that this receptor was less potent in inducing apoptosis in RHT29 cells and that its activation induces MAPK signaling in resistant cells.Taking together, these results suggest that MMP7 is related to the acquisition of oxaliplatin-resistance and that its inhibition restores drug sensitivity by increasing Fas receptor. Furthermore, Fas undergoes a change in its functionality in oxaliplatin-resistant cells inducing survival pathways instead of apoptotic signals."
https://openalex.org/W2019008641,"Early events leading to the establishment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are not completely understood. We show that intact and dynamic microtubules play a key role in the initiation of productive HCV infection. Microtubules were required for virus entry into cells, as evidenced using virus pseudotypes presenting HCV envelope proteins on their surface. Studies carried out using the recent infectious HCV model revealed that microtubules also play an essential role in early, postfusion steps of the virus cycle. Moreover, low concentrations of vinblastin and nocodazol, microtubule-affecting drugs, and paclitaxel, which stabilizes microtubules, inhibited infection, suggesting that microtubule dynamic instability and/or treadmilling mechanisms are involved in HCV internalization and early transport. By protein chip and direct core-dependent pull-down assays, followed by mass spectrometry, we identified beta- and alpha-tubulin as cellular partners of the HCV core protein. Surface plasmon resonance analyses confirmed that core directly binds to tubulin with high affinity via amino acids 2-117. The interaction of core with tubulin in vitro promoted its polymerization and enhanced the formation of microtubules. Immune electron microscopy showed that HCV core associates, at least temporarily, with microtubules polymerized in its presence. Studies by confocal microscopy showed a juxtaposition of core with microtubules in HCV-infected cells. In summary, we report that intact and dynamic microtubules are required for virus entry into cells and for early postfusion steps of infection. HCV may exploit a direct interaction of core with tubulin, enhancing microtubule polymerization, to establish efficient infection and promote virus transport and/or assembly in infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2084555974,"Background Isotopes can provide unique solutions to fundamental problems related to the ecology and evolution of migration and dispersal because prior movements of individuals can theoretically be tracked from tissues collected from a single capture. However, there is still remarkably little information available about how and why isotopes vary in wild animal tissues, especially over large spatial scales. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we describe variation in both stable-hydrogen (δDF) and strontium (87Sr/86SrF) isotopic compositions in the feathers of a migratory songbird, the Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), across 18 sampling sites in North America and then examine potential mechanisms driving this variation. We found that δDF was correlated with latitude of the sampling site, whereas 87Sr/86SrF was correlated with longitude. δDF was related to δD of meteoric waters where molting occurred and 87Sr/86SrF was influenced primarily by the geology in the area where feathers were grown. Using simulation models, we then assessed the utility of combining both markers to estimate the origin of individuals. Using 13 geographic regions, we found that the number of individuals correctly assigned to their site of origin increased from less than 40% using either δD or 87Sr/86Sr alone to 74% using both isotopes. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that these isotopes have the potential to provide predictable and complementary markers for estimating long-distance animal movements. Combining isotopes influenced by different global-scale processes may allow researchers to link the population dynamics of animals across large geographic ranges."
https://openalex.org/W2100070396,"The surface expression and localization of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) at dendritic spines are tightly controlled to regulate synaptic transmission. Here we show that de novo exocytosis of the GluR2 AMPAR subunit occurs at the dendritic shaft and that new AMPARs diffuse into spines by lateral diffusion in the membrane. However, membrane topology restricts this lateral diffusion. We therefore investigated which mechanisms recruit AMPARs to spines from the shaft and demonstrated that inhibition of dynamin GTPase activity reduced lateral diffusion of membrane-anchored green fluorescent protein and super-ecliptic pHluorin (SEP)-GluR2 into spines. In addition, the activation of synaptic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors enhanced lateral diffusion of SEP-GluR2 and increased the number of endogenous AMPARs in spines. The NMDA-invoked effects were prevented by dynamin inhibition, suggesting that activity-dependent dynamin-mediated endocytosis within spines generates a net inward membrane drift that overrides lateral diffusion barriers to enhance membrane protein delivery into spines. These results provide a novel mechanistic explanation of how AMPARs and other membrane proteins are recruited to spines by synaptic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1969712358,"Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of coronary artery disease (CAD). There is increasing recognition that lesion composition rather than size determines the acute complications of atherosclerotic disease. Low serum adiponectin levels were reported to be associated with coronary artery disease and future incidence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The impact of adiponectin on lesion composition still remains to be determined.We measured serum adiponectin levels in 303 patients with stable typical or atypical chest pain, who underwent dual-source multi-slice CT-angiography to exclude coronary artery stenosis. Atherosclerotic plaques were classified as calcified, mixed or non-calcified. In bivariate analysis adiponectin levels were inversely correlated with total coronary plaque burden (r = -0.21, p = 0.0004), mixed (r = -0.20, p = 0.0007) and non-calcified plaques (r = -0.18, p = 0.003). No correlation was seen with calcified plaques (r = -0.05, p = 0.39). In a fully adjusted multivariate model adiponectin levels remained predictive of total plaque burden (estimate: -0.036, 95%CI: -0.052 to -0.020, p<0.0001), mixed (estimate: -0.087, 95%CI: -0.132 to -0.042, p = 0.0001) and non-calcified plaques (estimate: -0.076, 95%CI: -0.115 to -0.038, p = 0.0001). Adiponectin levels were not associated with calcified plaques (estimate: -0.021, 95% CI: -0.043 to -0.001, p = 0.06). Since the majority of coronary plaques was calcified, adiponectin levels account for only 3% of the variability in total plaque number. In contrast, adiponectin accounts for approximately 20% of the variability in mixed and non-calcified plaque burden.Adiponectin levels predict mixed and non-calcified coronary atherosclerotic plaque burden. Low adiponectin levels may contribute to coronary plaque vulnerability and may thus play a role in the pathophysiology of ACS."

Here, we show that silencing of D4-GDI by RNA interference abrogates tumor growth and lung metastasis of otherwise highly invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.

Silencing of D4-GDI results in constitutive Rac1 activation and translocation from the cytosol to cellular membrane compartments and in sustained activation of p38 and JNK kinases. Rac1 blockade inhibits p38/JNK kinase activities and the spontaneous anoikis of D4-GDI knockdown cells.

However, only a few genes overlap among the results from different laboratories, and most of the genes are not yet characterized as functional mediators of breast cancer progression. The molecular basis of breast tumorigenesis remains to be fully understood.

In this study, we explored the roles of D4-GDI in breast tumor growth and metastasis by manipulating its protein expression in MDA-MB-231 cells, a highly invasive breast cancer cell line that expresses high levels of D4-GDI (32Zhang Y. Zhang B. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5592-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of D4-GDI abolishes tumor growth and experimental metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells both in vitro and in vivo. We also show that D4-GDI regulates breast cancer cell growth through a signaling pathway that involves Rac GTPases and p38/JNK kinases. Thus, our results support a functional link between D4-GDI expression and enhanced breast cancer cell growth and invasion. Cell Lines and Antibodies—The MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Its derivatives stably expressing small interfering RNA (siRNA) against human D4-GDI (siD4-GDI) or firefly luciferase (siLuc) transcripts were described previously (32Zhang Y. Zhang B.

Clones I-2-h and II-3-d as indicated were randomly chosen from 10 stable clones for these studies. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium (1:1; Mediatech, Herndon, VA) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 4 mmol/liter glutamine, 50 μmol/liter β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mmol/liter sodium pyruvate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in air. The stable cell lines were maintained in complete medium supplemented with hygromycin at 450 μg/ml. Antibodies specific to human D4-GDI, RhoGDI, Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA were obtained from Pharmingen. Anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) antibody (clone GST2) was from Sigma. Anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody (clone 12CA5) was from Roche Applied Science. Polyclonal antibodies to JNK, phospho-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), p38, phosphos-p38 (Thr180/Tyr182), ERK, and phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). The cell-permeable inhibitors of p38 (SB202190 and SB203580), JNK (SP600125), and ERK1/2 (PD98059) were from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). siRNA oligonucleotide sequences specific to human D4-GDI, Rac1, and RhoA were designed using the BLOCK-iT RNAi Designer (Invitrogen). All Stealth RNA interference duplexes and their corresponding negative controls with similar GC content were purchased from Invitrogen. D4-GDI siRNA sequences were 5′-GAGCUGGACAGCAAGCUCAAUUAUA-3′ (designated siD4-GDI-I; positions 49–73), 5′-CAAAGAUGAUGAGAGUCUAAUUAAG-3′ (designated siD4-GDI-II; positions 117–141), and 5′-GAAAGUGGAUAAAGCAACAUUUAUG-3′ (designated siD4-GDI-III; positions 402–426). Transient transfections of RNA interference duplexes were carried out using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). Animal Studies—Female athymic nude mice (4–6 weeks old; NCI, National Institutes of Health) were used for all studies. Cells were grown to 70–80% confluence, harvested by trypsinization, and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. For xenografting studies, 5 × 106 cells were suspended in 100 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution and injected subcutaneously into the backs of the mice (10 mice/group). Tumor growth was monitored at the indicated times by externally measuring tumor length (L) and width (W) with a caliper. Xenograft volume (V) was calculated by the following equation: V = (L× W2) × 0.5. To assay metastasis, 2 × 105 cells were suspended in 50 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution and injected into the lateral tail vein. After 6 weeks, the mice were killed, and the lungs were removed and kept in Bouin's fixative. The tumor nodules on the lung surface appeared white, whereas the normal lung tissue appeared brown. The number of tumor colonies on the surface of each lung was counted under a dissecting microscope. Plasmids and Transfection—The pcDNA3.1 constructs (Invitrogen) encoding HA-tagged human D4-GDI, RhoGDI, Rac1, and Cdc42 were obtained from Guthrie Research Institute (Sayre, PA). The inserts were amplified by PCR and subcloned into a pCEFL-GST vector to generate constructs encoding GST-D4-GDI and GST-RhoGDI. The pEGFP-C1 vectors (Clontech) for green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Rac1, GFP-Cdc42, and GFP-RhoA were generated in a similar manner. The pGEX-KG-PAK1 and pGEX-rhotekin constructs, encoding a GST-fused effector-binding domain specific to Rac/Cdc42 and RhoA, respectively, have been described previously (36Zhang B. Zhang Y. Shacter E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5716-5725Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The rescue plasmid for restoring D4-GDI expression, pEGFP-C3-D4-GDI-re, was as described (32Zhang Y. Zhang B. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5592-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The insert was subcloned into a pDSRed-C1 vector (Clontech), yielding a construct for expression of a red fluorescence protein-tagged D4-GDI-re protein. All constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing. Transfections were carried out using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Viability and Apoptosis Assays—Wild-type, siLuc-expressing, or siD4-GDI-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in complete medium supplemented with 5% FBS on plastic dishes (anchorage-dependent growth) or 0.6% agarose (anchorage-independent condition). To assess colony formation in soft agar, cells (1 × 103/ml) were mixed with 0.3% agarose in complete medium containing 10% FBS and grown on a 0.6% agarose base layer as described (37van Golen K.L. Wu Z.F. Qiao X.T. Bao L.W. Merajver S.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5832-5838PubMed Google Scholar). To determine anoikis, cells were grown on soft agar or poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (polyHEMA; Sigma)-coated 6-well plates, which prevents cells from adhering to the plastic wells. The polyHEMA coating was performed as described (38Zhu Z. Sanchez-Sweatman O. Huang X. Wiltrout R. Khokha R. Zhao Q. Gorelik E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1707-1716PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, polyHEMA was dissolved in 95% ethanol (120 mg/ml), and aliquots were added to each well, yielding a 1-mm coating layer. After culture for the indicated times, cells were harvested and analyzed using a FACScan after staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-annexin V and propidium iodide (39Zhang B. Zhang Y. Shacter E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6205-6214Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cell growth on regular plastic dishes was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (40Zhang B. Zhang Y. Dagher M.C. Shacter E. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6054-6062Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In Vitro Invasion Assay—The in vitro invasion activity was assayed using BioCoat Matrigel invasion chambers (BD Bioscience) as described (32Zhang Y. Zhang B. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5592-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 105/ml) in serum-free medium were loaded into the upper chamber of Transwells. Invasion across a 1-mm Matrigel layer was initiated by adding 20% FBS (chemoattractant) to the lower chamber. Control chambers contained the same pore size membrane (8.0 μm) but without the Matrigel coating. The chambers were incubated for 20 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells remaining on the upper surface of the membranes were removed by scraping with a cotton swab, and those on the lower surface of the membranes were counted after staining with toluidine blue (Fluka). The percent invasion was calculated as follows: the number of cells that traversed the Matrigel-coated membrane divided by the number of cells that traverse the uncoated membrane. Statistical analyses were performed using an unpaired, two-tailed t test. Endogenous Rho GTPase Activity—The assay is based on the high affinity binding of GTP-bound GTPase to its specific effector protein (36Zhang B. Zhang Y. Shacter E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5716-5725Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). RhoA-GTP was detected using the GST-rhotekin Rho-binding domain, whereas the GST-PAK1-binding domain was used to quantify Rac and Cdc42 activities. Briefly, cells were grown to 80% confluence on plastic dishes or 0.6% soft agar in the presence of 5% FBS, harvested, and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of cell lysates were incubated with agarose-immobilized GST-rhotekin or GST-PAK1 at 4 °C for 30 min. The coprecipitates were subjected to immunoassays using antibodies specific to the individual GTPases. Immunoprecipitation and Affinity Precipitation—For immunoprecipitation assays, cells were lysed in assay buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (Calbiochem). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 14,000 × g. Cell lysate was then precleared with protein A-agarose beads for 30 min, and the proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-D4-GDI antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then collected by centrifugation and washed three times with assay buffer. The presence of Rho GTPases in the immunoprecipitates was detected by Western blotting. To facilitate affinity precipitation assays, stable MDA-MB-231 cell lines expressing GST-D4-GDI or GST-RhoGDI were generated. GDI complexes were isolated with glutathione-agarose beads. Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were cultured on glass chamber slides at 70–80% confluence and transiently transfected with plasmids for GFP-tagged Rho proteins. After fixation in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, the slides were mounted with Antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Confocal microscopy acquisitions were performed on a Zeiss LSM 5 PASCAL confocal laser scanning microscope. All images are representative of three to five independent experiments. Western Blotting—Cell lysates in 2% SDS lysis buffer or immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% BisTris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by ECL reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). When necessary, the membranes were stripped using Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) and reprobed with appropriate antibodies. D4-GDI Down-regulation by siRNA Abrogates Tumor Formation and Experimental Metastasis—Our previous work showed that D4-GDI is highly expressed in a number of breast cancer cell lines, with the greatest abundance in MDA-MB-231 cells (32Zhang Y. Zhang B. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5592-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We also showed that down-regulation of D4-GDI by RNA interference results in a decrease in cell migration and invasion through Matrigel, which can be rescued by restoration of D4-GDI protein expression (32Zhang Y. Zhang B. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5592-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because MDA-MB-231 cells have been shown to be highly invasive (41Coopman P.J. Do M.T. Barth M. Bowden E.T. Hayes A.J. Basyuk E. Blancato J.K. Vezza P.R. McLeskey S.W. Mangeat P.H. Mueller S.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 742-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether lowering D4-GDI expression in these cells might inhibit tumor formation and metastasis in vivo. To this end, we established stable MDA-MB-231 cell lines that express siD4-GDI. Silencing of firefly luciferase (siLuc) was used as a control. siD4-GDI specifically suppressed D4-GDI protein expression without changing the levels of RhoGDI, a homolog sharing 75% sequence identity (Fig. 1A). Two stable clones lacking D4-GDI, clones I-2-h and II-3-d, were randomly chosen for further studies. The number of subclones was limited to five. The effect of D4-GDI expression on tumor growth was assessed by subcutaneous injection into nude mice. Parental MDA-MB-231 cells developed into large tumors, whereas D4-GDI knockdown cells (clone I-2-h) showed only minimal growth in vivo (Fig. 1B), even at 3 months post-inoculation (data not shown). To determine whether down-regulation of D4-GDI inhibits metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells, cells were injected intravenously through the tail veins of nude mice. Consistent with published results (42Han H.J. Russo J. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Nature. 2008; 452: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 43Jiang P. Enomoto A. Jijiwa M. Kato T. Hasegawa T. Ishida M. Sato T. Asai N. Murakumo Y. Takahashi M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1310-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells formed 250–300 metastatic nodules per lung in 80% of the animals analyzed (23 of 29) 6 weeks post-injection (four groups of n = 10 mice, 11 dropouts due to critical conditions, a total of 29 mice analyzed) (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained for cells expressing siLuc. In contrast, no nodules were visible in the lungs of animals injected with D4-GDI knockdown cells (clone I-2-h; four groups of n = 10 mice, a total of 40 mice analyzed). Metastatic nodules were not observed in the livers of animals from both groups. D4-GDI knockdown clone II-3-d behaved similarly to clone I-2-h in tumor growth and lung colony formation (data not shown). These results show that targeted disruption of D4-GDI effectively abrogated both tumor growth and experimental metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells in nude mice. Loss of D4-GDI Induces Anoikis in MDA-MB-231 Cells—To determine the mechanism through which D4-GDI knockdown blocks tumor growth, we studied the growth properties of stable clones under different conditions in vitro. In monolayer culture (anchorage-dependent growth), D4-GDI-depleted cells retained the epithelial morphology of parental MDA-MB-231 cells. The growth rate was only slightly lower (<2-fold) than that of the parental cells and cells expressing siLuc (Fig. 2A). When cultured on soft agar (anchorage-independent growth), the parental MDA-MB-231 cells formed over 150 colonies >50 μm in size per well at day 10. A similar number of colonies were found for cells expressing siLuc. However, D4-GDI-deficient cells formed only zero to five colonies per well (Fig. 2B). Cells were then grown on Matrigel, mimicking in vivo growing conditions. D4-GDI knockdown cells lost the unpolarized and branching morphology of parental cells and showed at least 10-fold lower cell viability at day 10 (Fig. 2C), consistent with our previous findings that down-regulation of D4-GDI results in the loss of cell-matrix adhesion (32Zhang Y. Zhang B. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5592-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These results show that D4-GDI knockdown had a minimal effect on anchorage-dependent growth of MDA-MB-231 cells but significantly inhibited cell growth under anchorage-independent conditions. To determine whether the observed growth inhibition was due to anoikis, cells were cultured on polyHEMA-coated plates, which completely prevents cell adhesion (38Zhu Z. Sanchez-Sweatman O. Huang X. Wiltrout R. Khokha R. Zhao Q. Gorelik E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1707-1716PubMed Google Scholar). To rule out the possible off-target effects of siRNA, we designed three siRNA duplexes targeting different regions on the D4-GDI gene. At 24 h post-transfection, D4-GDI protein was decreased by ∼60%, whereas RhoGDI was not altered (Fig. 3A). Cells were then cultured on polyHEMA-coated wells for an additional 24 h and analyzed for apoptosis by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Strikingly, D4-GDI knockdown cells underwent massive cell death (30–50%) as indicated by FITC-annexin V and/or propidium iodide staining (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, cells transfected with a control siRNA had only basal (<5%) apoptosis. Collectively, these results demonstrate that D4-GDI knockdown induced anoikis of MDA-MB-231 cells grown under anchorage-independent conditions. Given that D4-GDI knockdown only slightly reduced cell proliferation (Fig. 2A), it is therefore reasonable to propose that the observed growth inhibition on soft agar or even in nude mice is at least in part due to induction of anoikis in the target cells. Consistent with our previous data (32Zhang Y. Zhang B. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5592-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), knockdown of D4-GDI with different siRNA sequences uniformly inhibited invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro (Fig. 3D). Similar effects were obtained with the three siD4-GDI duplexes, supporting the specificity of siRNA effects. D4-GDI Associates Primarily with Rac GTPases in Breast Cancer Cells—To delineate the signaling pathways by which D4-GDI controls cell survival and invasion, we set out to identify the Rho GTPases that associate with D4-GDI in breast cancer cells. To this end, whole cell extracts from MDA-MB-231 cells were immunoprecipitated using anti-D4-GDI antibodies and probed for Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA, which represent the three major subfamilies of Rho GTPases. Endogenous Rac1 was strongly detected in D4-GDI immunocomplexes from parental cells, whereas Cdc42 and RhoA showed little or no detectable binding to D4-GDI (Fig. 4A). None of these GTPases was detected in the immunoprecipitates from D4-GDI knockdown cells. To confirm these results, we generated stable MDA-MB-231 cell lines that express GST-D4-GDI or GST-RhoGDI fusion protein or GST alone and performed affinity precipitation assays. Consistent with the above results, Rac1, but not Cdc42 or RhoA, was precipitated with GST-D4-GDI (Fig. 4B). As expected (22DerMardirossian C. Bokoch G.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 356-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), GST-RhoGDI formed stable complexes with all three GTPases. To determine whether D4-GDI might also associate with other Rac GTPases that are expressed in breast cancer cells, several HA-tagged GTPases were transiently expressed in the stable cell lin"

Treatment of tumor cells with certain chemotherapeutic agents activates premature senescence to decrease the tumorigenecity. Here we show that sublethal concentrations of adriamycin could induce premature senescence in lung cancer cells. Adriamycin treatment resulted in the up-regulation of BMP4, which is underexpressed in NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancers). Moreover, the BMP4-Smad pathway played a key role in mediating adriamycin-induced senescence. Overexpression of BMP4 was able to induce premature senescence in lung cancer cells and this process required the participation of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors p16INK4a and p21WAF1/cip1. We also show that increases of p16INK4a and p21WAF1/cip1 expression in response to BMP4 were mediated by the Smad signaling pathway. Furthermore, our data revealed that p300 was recruited to P16INK4a and P21WAF1/cip1 promoters by Smad1/5/8 to induce the hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the promoters. The present study provides useful clues to the evaluation of the potentiality of BMP4 as a responsive molecular target for cancer chemotherapy.

Normal cells undergo senescence after a limited number of generations of proliferation (1Hayflick L. Exp. Cell Res. 1965; 37: 614-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (4229) Google Scholar). Senescent cells remain metabolically active but have lost the ability to undergo further divisions. Generally, somatic cells lose their proliferation potency depending upon the degree of telomere shortening, a process known as the replicative senescence. Recently, however, several groups have reported another type of cellular senescence, termed the premature or rapid senescence, which is provoked by the induced expression of specific genes and is independent of telomere shortening (2Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3887) Google Scholar). Premature senescence is commonly characterized by a flat enlarged cell morphology, growth arrest, and high acidic β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) 3The abbreviations used are: β-gal, β-galactosidase; DOX, doxycycline; cdk, cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; R-Smad, receptor-phosphorylated Smads; I-Smad, inhibitory Smads; RT, reverse transcriptase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. 3The abbreviations used are: β-gal, β-galactosidase; DOX, doxycycline; cdk, cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; R-Smad, receptor-phosphorylated Smads; I-Smad, inhibitory Smads; RT, reverse transcriptase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. activity, and it usually occurs within a week of exposure to sublethal stresses. The ability to induce senescence in a week of time implicates that the telomere of these senescent cells could not be shortened to the threshold length within such a short period of time (3Katakura Y. Nakata E. Miura T. Shirahata S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 4Schmitt C.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochem. 2003; 67: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Many cancer cells exposed to genotoxic stresses undergo permanent cell cycle arrest and acquire a senescence-like phenotype (6Jackson J.G. Pereira-Smith O.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2501-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Senescence is a state of permanent growth arrest in which cells are refractory to mitogenic stimuli. Induction of senescence in tumor cells may be a stopgap mechanism in early cancer transitions that are abrogated in the transition to full malignancy (7Zhang X. Kim J. Ruthazer R. McDevitt M.A. Wazer D.E. Paulson K.E. Yee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8252-8266Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Several anticancer chemotherapeutic drugs, such as adriamycin, can cause senescence in solid tumors (8Elmore L.W. Rehder C.W. Di X. McChesney P.A. Jackson-Cook C.K. Gewirtz D.A. Holt S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35509-35515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). However, unlike replicative senescence, premature senescence is associated with more rapid kinetics (hence, the term “accelerated senescence”) and telomere dysfunction without overall telomere shortening (9te Poele R.H. Okorokov A.L. Jardine L. Cummings J. Joel S.P. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1876-1883PubMed Google Scholar). A number of previous studies showed that breast and lung tumor cells resected from patients who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy exhibited senescence markers, including positive staining for SA-β-gal, whereas normal surrounding tissues or tumors from untreated patients did not (9te Poele R.H. Okorokov A.L. Jardine L. Cummings J. Joel S.P. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1876-1883PubMed Google Scholar, 10Roberson R.S. Kussick S.J. Vallieres E. Chen S.Y. Wu D.Y. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2795-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate the importance of the premature senescence in cancer therapy.Concomitant with its role in suppressing cancers, cellular senescence is found to be controlled by several tumor suppressor genes including p53 and retinoblastoma in tumor cells (11Sugrue M.M. Shin D.Y. Lee S.W. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 12Xu H.J. Zhou Y. Ji W. Perng G.S. Kruzelock R. Kong C.T. Bast R.C. Mills G.B. Li J. Hu S.X. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2589-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Cellular senescence involves the activation of several tumor suppressor proteins and inactivation of several oncoproteins via the P53 or RB (retinoblastoma) pathway (13Cammarano M.S. Nekrasova T. Noel B. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9532-9542Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, evidence demonstrating links between cellular senescence and these tumor suppressor pathways has also been obtained. For instance, cells derived from mice in which the gene encoding the p53 or INK4 protein was inactive failed to undergo senescence in response to multiple stimuli, and became cancerous at an early stage (14Ghebranious N. Donehower L.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3385-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor P21WAF1/cip1 (hereafter P21), has been discovered to be overexpressed in the process of senescence. Overexpression of p21 led to cell growth arrest, and this process became irreversible and the arrested cells acquired a senescent phenotype (15Noda A. Ning Y. Venable S.F. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar, 16Wang Y. Blandino G. Givol D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2643-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). P21, which is usually transcriptionally induced by p53-dependent mechanisms, however, can be induced by several p53-independent signaling pathways, resulting in growth arrest or differentiation (17Chen J. Huang X. Halicka D. Brodsky S. Avram A. Eskander J. Bloomgarden N.A. Darzynkiewicz Z. Goligorsky M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: H1575-H1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belong to a subgroup of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily (18Halbrooks P.J. Ding R. Wozney J.M. Bain G. J. Mol. Signal. 2007; 2: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). BMPs are phytogenetically conserved proteins, which are essential for embryonic lung development. It has been reported that BMP4 was infrequently expressed in non-small cell lung cancers (19Langenfeld E.M. Bojnowski J. Perone J. Langenfeld J. Ann. Thorac. Surg. 2005; 80: 1028-1032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). BMPs elicit their effects through activation of type-1 and type-2 serine/threonine kinase receptors. BMPs and TGF-β/activin receptor-phosphorylated Smads (R-Smads) oligomerize with the common mediator Smad4 (Co-Smad), and after nuclear import, they regulate gene expression by binding to DNA (20Miyazono K. Maeda S. Imamura T. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). BMP receptors activate Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8, whereas Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated by activin or TGF-β receptors (21Zwijsen A. Verschueren K. Huylebroeck D. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22ten Dijke P. Korchynskyi O. Valdimarsdottir G. Goumans M.J. Mol. Cell.

Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Smad6 and Smad7 have been identified as the inhibitory Smads (I-Smads) (25Ishisaki A. Yamato K. Hashimoto S. Nakao A. Tamaki K. Nonaka K. ten Dijke P. Sugino H. Nishihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13637-13642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). I-Smads stably interact with activated type-1 receptors and compete with R-Smads for activation by the receptors. Smad6 has also been reported to compete with Co-Smads (Smad4) for complex formation with R-Smads. Moreover, Smad7 inhibits both TGF-β/activin and BMP signaling, and Smad6 efficiently inhibits BMP signaling but only weakly inhibits TGF-β/activin signaling (25Ishisaki A. Yamato K. Hashimoto S.

BMP4, another member of the TGF-β superfamily, has been shown to drive A549 cancer cells into replicative senescence in vitro (28Buckley S. Shi W. Driscoll B. Ferrario A. Anderson K. Warburton D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: L81-L86Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); but the mechanisms underlying this process are still unclear. All these data intrigued us to speculate that BMP4 and TGF-β1 might participate in adriamycin-triggered premature senescence in non-small cell lung cancer cells to decrease the tumorigenecity.In the present study, we identified a novel role of BMP4-Smad signaling in mediating adriamycin-induced premature senescence in lung cancer cells. We showed that overexpression of BMP4 could trigger premature senescence without telomere shortening, in addition to its known action of inducing telomere shortening-dependent replicative senescence in vitro (28Buckley S. Shi W. Driscoll B. Ferrario A. Anderson K. Warburton D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: L81-L86Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Moreover, we identified that cell cycle regulatory proteins p16 and p21 were required for BMP4 induced-premature senescence, in which Smad signaling molecules and coactivator p300 played a role. Based on the experimental data generated from this study, we demonstrate the molecular interactions and signaling pathways in adriamycin-induced senescence and identify the role of BMP4 in the control of certain lung cancers.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs—The P16INK4a (hereafter P16) promoter reporter (-869 to +1 bp from the cap site) ligated to the luciferase reporter gene (pGL2 basic, Promega) was provided by Dr. E. Hara (Imperial Cancer Research Fund Laboratories, London). The pcDNA3-myc-Smad6 expression plasmid was provided by Dr. S. Itoh (Department of Experimental Pathology, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Japan). The plasmid of the p21-luc (2400/+11) was a gift from Dr. Bert Vogelstein (The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). The pSTAR vector was kindly provided by Dr. Q. Zeng, (Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore). The pSTAR was constructed with neomycin resistance for selection of stably transfected cells, and a cloning cassette for placing a gene of interest under the control of the tetO DNA motif. This plasmid expresses rtTAnls, which upon association with tetracycline, binds to and drives gene expression from the tetO DNA motif. The pEGFP-hBMP4 expression plasmid was provided by Dr. X. Q. Jiang (The Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University). hBMP4 cDNA was amplified from pEGFP-hBMP4 plasmid. A 1.2-kb DNA fragment containing the entire coding region of BMP4 was ligated to pSTAR. Recombinant plasmids with the 1.2-kb fragment inserted in the correct orientation were characterized by restriction enzyme digestion. The purified pSTAR/hBMP4 was used for transfection.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Reporter Assay—NCI-H460, HCT116, and A549 cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 mg/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient transfection of A549, HCT116, and NCI-H460 cells were performed using the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and the FuGENE HD transfection (Roche) procedures, respectively. Transfected cells were assayed for luciferase reporter activity using a Promega dual-luciferase reporter assay system, and the Renilla luciferase control plasmid pREP7-RLuc was co-transfected for normalization.Construction of Stably Transfected Cell Lines—NCI-H460 cells were transfected with pSTAR/hBMP4 or pSTAR using the FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Roche). Cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 mg/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and G418 (1000 μg/ml). After 15–22 days, individual colonies were isolated and expanded. Stably transfected cell lines were maintained in IMDM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of G418 (1000 μg/ml). The cell line that induceably expresses BMP4 protein was designated the pSTAR-hBMP4. Induction of BMP4 expression by doxycycline (Clontech) was both dose- and time-dependent in the pSTAR-hBMP4 cell line. The cell line transfected with pTet-on only, designated the pSTAR, was used as a control.RNA Extraction, Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and Real-time PCR Analyses—Total cellular RNA was extracted from A549, HCT116, and NCI-H460 cells according to the Promega Total RNA Isolation System manual. RT-PCR was performed using the Access RT-PCR System supplied by Promega. Real-time PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems), following the manufacturer's protocol, with SYBR Green (TaKaRa, Osaka, Japan) used as a double-stranded DNA-specific fluorescent dye. The primer pairs for the P16 gene were: sense, 5′-ttcctggacacgctggt-3′ and antisense, 5′-caatcggggatgtctgag-3′. The primer pairs for the P21 gene were: sense, 5′-ggatgtccgtcagaaccc-3′ and antisense, 5′-gctcccaggcgaagtca-3′. The primer pairs for BMP4 gene were: sense, 5′-agcatgtcaggattagccga-3′ and antisense, 5′-tggagatggcactcagttca-3′. TGF-β1 gene were: sense, 5′-ccaactattgcttcagctcca-3′ and antisense, 5′-ttatgctggttgtacaggg-3′. The β-actin primer pairs were: sense, 5′-tcgtgcgtgacattaaggag-3′ and antisense, 5′-atgccagggtacatggtggt-3′.Western Blotting—Cells were harvested after treatments and lysed in the lysis buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. Total cell extracts were separated in 12% SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with anti-p16 (Santa Cruz), anti-myc (Upstate Biotechnology, NY), anti-BMP4 (Santa Cruz), anti-p53 (Abcam), anti-p21 (Santa Cruz), anti-Phospho-Smad1 (Ser-463/465)/Smad5(Ser-463/465)/Smad8(Ser-426/428) (Cell Signaling Technology), or anti-β-actin (Sigma) antibodies. The signals were visualized by using the Chemiluminescent Substrate method with the SuperSignal West Pico kit provided by Pierce Co.Cellular Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in culture medium for 10 min at 37 °C and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at 4 °C. Trimethylated histone H3 was detected with antibody against anti-3meK9H3 antibody (Abcam) and visualized with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Zhongshan, China). Photographs were taken with a confocal microscopy.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays were carried out using a kit supplied by Upstate following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were cross-linked with 2% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C, and then lysed in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1) with protease inhibitors. The sonicated lysates were processed using a ChIP assay kit, essentially as described by the manufacturer (Upstate). DNA was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against Ac-H3 (Upstate), Ac-H4 (Upstate), p300 (Santa Cruz), and phospho-Smad1/5/8. The precipitated chromatin was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using SYBR Green dye. The primers specific to sequences at the P16 promoter were: P1 sense, 5′-cattcgctaagtgctcggagt-3′, antisense, 5′-ctgctccccgccgcccgctgcctg-3′; P2 sense, 5′-taggaaggttgtatcgcggagg-3′, antisense, 5′-caaggaaggaggactgggctc-3′; and P3 sense, 5′-agacagccgttttacacgcag-3′, antisense, 5′-caccgagaaatcgaaatcacc-3′. The primers specific to sequences at the P21 promoter were: Q1 sense, 5′-accaacgcaggcgaggga-3′, antisense, 5′-ccggctccacaaggaact-3′; Q2 sense, 5′-ggtgtctaggtgctccaggt-3′, antisense, 5′-gcactctccaggaggacaca-3′, Q3 sense, 5′-cgtggtggtggtgagcta-3′, antisense, 5′-ctgtctgcaccttcgctcct-3′. To calculate the relative abundance of a given gene promoter present in an immunoprecipitate, the following formula was used: Qgene = IPgene/input gene, to calibrate the variation between different samples and primer pairs.RNA Interference (RNAi)—The siRNA targeting sequences of P16 and P21 were 5′-aacgcaccgaatagttacggt-3′ (29Voorhoeve P.M. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 311-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and 5′-aatggcgggctgcatccagga-3′ (30Rao A. Coan A. Welsh J.E. Barclay W.W. Koumenis C. Cramer S.D. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2143-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), respectively. The BMP4-specific siRNA sequence was 5′-gaggcgacacttctacagatg-3′ (31Sorescu G.P. Song H. Tressel S.L. Hwang J. Dikalov S. Smith D.A. Boyd N.L. Platt M.O. Lassegue B. Griendling K.K. Jo H. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The P53-specific siRNA sequence was 5′-gactccagtggtaatctac-3′ (32Ding B. Chi S.G. Kim S.H. Kang S. Cho J.H. Kim D.S. Cho N.H. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2284-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The control siRNA sequence was 5′-cgtcaacatggctttcacc-3′. Oligonucleotides that represent small hairpin RNAs targeting these sequences were designed, synthesized, and cloned into the pSliencer4.1-CMV neo vector (Ambion) between BamHI and HindIII sites according to the manufacturers instructions.Cell Proliferation and MTT Assay—Cell proliferation was measured by using the MTT assay. After transfection or treatments, cells were incubated with 5 mg/ml MTT solution for 4 h. The medium was aspirated, and the formazan product was solubilized with 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide. Viability was assessed by measuring the absorbance at 492 nm with a microplate reader.Senescence-associated Galactosidase (SA-β-gal) Activity Assay and Cytochemical Staining for SA-β-Galactosidase—Cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of total protein were diluted in equal volumes of 2× assay buffer containing 1.33 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl-d-galactopyranoside, 2 mm MgCl2, and 100 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol in 200 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The absorbance at 420 nm was measured after addition of an equal volume of 1 m Na2CO3.Cytochemical staining for SA-β-galactosidase was performed using a Senescence β-Galactosidase Staining Kit (Cell Signaling Technology) at pH 6.0. All the experiments were repeated three times, and one of the representative results is shown.Statistical Analysis—The Student's t test was used to calculate the statistical significance of the experimental data. The significance level was set as *, p < 0.05; #, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ##, p < 0.01. Error bars denote the standard deviations.RESULTSAdriamycin-induced Premature Senescence in Company with the Up-regulation of BMP4 in Lung Cancer Cells—Because growth arrest is a necessary step leading to cell senescence, we first determined whether adriamycin treatment affected cell proliferation. MTT assays showed that adriamycin was able to decrease the proliferation indices of NCI-H460 and A549 cells at 500 nm and 2 μm, respectively (Fig. 1A). We then found that NCI-H460 and A549 cells treated with adriamycin exhibited phenotypic changes that resembled those observed in cells undergoing senescence, including the intensified SA-β-gal staining, flattened cell morphology, and enlarged cell size, in just 1 week (Fig. 1B). We next examined the endogenous SA-β-gal (pH 6.0) activity. As shown in Fig. 1C, a great increase in SA-β-gal activity was seen 6 days after adriamycin treatment, in comparison with untreated cells. Because the occurrence of heterochromatin foci is a typical marker in human cells undergoing senescence; we therefore examined whether adriamycin was able to induce heterochromatin foci. As shown in Fig. 1D, the heterochromatin foci were readily visible in senescent cells treated with adriamycin by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. Concurrently, trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 9 (3meK9H3), a well characterized heterochromatin mark (33Vance K.W. Carreira S. Brosch G. Goding C.R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), was colocalized with specific heterochromatic foci. The percentage of cells containing heterochromatic foci was greatly increased when the tumor cells were treated with adriamycin (Fig. 1E). These results indicated that adriamycin could induce tumor cell senescence to impair the tumorigenecity in non-small cell lung cancer cells. Furthermore, NCI-H460 cells were more sensitive to adriamycin than A549 cells.TGF-β1 and BMP4, two members of the TGF-β superfamily, have been reported to induce lung cancer cells into replicative senescence (3Katakura Y. Nakata E. Miura T. Shirahata S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 28Buckley S. Shi W. Driscoll B. Ferrario A. Anderson K. Warburton D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: L81-L86Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We then asked whether BMP4 and TGF-β1 were associated with the cellular senescence induced by adriamycin. As shown in Fig. 1, F and G, RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR data demonstrated that the BMP4 mRNA level was greatly up-regulated when NCI-H460 and A549 cells were treated with adriamycin at 500 nm and 2 μm, respectively, whereas TGF-β1 expression was not markedly changed. Meanwhile, the BMP4 protein level was also significantly elevated by adriamycin (Fig. 1H). These results indicated that BMP4 may participate in the adriamycin-induced premature senescence in lung cancer cells.BMP4 Played a Key Role in Mediating Adriamycin-induced Senescence in Lung Cancer Cells—To further characterize the function of BMP4 in adriamycin-induced senescence, we used the RNAi approach to knockdown BMP4 expression to assess its effects. The endogenous BMP4 protein expression was markedly reduced by transfection of specific BMP4 siRNA as confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). We then showed that suppression of endogenous BMP4 expression restrained the adriamycin-induced senescence (Fig. 2, B–E), eliciting the critical role of BMP4 in this process. To study how BMP4 mediated adriamycin-induced premature senescence, we constructed a stably transfected cell line that can be induced to express BMP4 protein by doxycycline (DOX). Western blotting was performed to verify the DOX inducibility of the transgenes in the pSTAR-hBMP4 cell line carrying the full-length BMP4 construct. Representative results are presented in Fig. 2, F and G, which show that induction of the BMP4 expression by DOX was both dose- and time-dependent. Moreover, Western blots revealed that the induction of BMP4 expression by DOX was well equivalent to the extent of BMP4 up-regulation by adriamycin (Fig. 2H), implying that induction of BMP4 expression by DOX in the pSTAR-hBMP4 cell line was able to imitate the biological process of premature senescence initiated by up-regulation of BMP4 in response to adriamycin. As shown in Fig. 2I, right, DOX-stimulated BMP4 expression decreased the proliferation index of NCI-H460 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and the proliferation ability of NCI-H460 cells was decreased greatly at 48 h as judged by MTT assays (Fig. 2I, right). In contrast, DOX treatment of pSTAR cells did not undergo changes in proliferation index, suggesting that DOX itself had no inhibitory effect on cell proliferation (Fig. 2I, left). Meanwhile, pSTAR-hBMP4 cells were triggered into senescence when they were treated with DOX for 6 days (Fig. 2, J–M). These results indicated that hBMP4 overexpression was able to induce the onset of senescence in lung cancer cells in 1 week. Numerous studies have highlighted that the telomere of the senescent cells would not shorten to the threshold length in 1 week (3Katakura Y. Nakata E. Miura T. Shirahata S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 4Schmitt C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1775: 5-20PubMed Google Scholar, 5Katakura Y. Nakata E. Tabira Y. Miura T. Teruya K. Tsuchiya T. Shirahata S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2003; 67: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, the above data may hint at a new role of BMP4 in triggering premature senescence in cancer cells, in addition to its reported role in causing replicative senescence in A549 cells.FIGURE 2BMP4 was required for the premature senescence induced by adriamycin in lung cancer cells.

Aiming toward the rational design of a pH-sensitive protein-protein interaction, we engineered pH-sensitive mutants of streptococcal protein G B1, a binder to the IgG constant region. We systematically introduced histidine residues into the binding interface to cause electrostatic repulsion on the basis of a rigid body model. Exquisite pH sensitivity of this interaction was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance and affinity chromatography employing a clinically used human IgG. The pH-sensitive mechanism of the interaction was analyzed and evaluated from kinetic, thermodynamic, and structural viewpoints. Histidine-mediated electrostatic repulsion resulted in significant loss of exothermic heat of the binding that decreased the affinity only at acidic conditions, thereby improving the pH sensitivity. The reduced binding energy was partly recovered by ""enthalpy-entropy compensation."" Crystal structures of the designed mutants confirmed the validity of the rigid body model on which the effective electrostatic repulsion was based. Moreover, our data suggested that the entropy gain involved exclusion of water molecules solvated in a space formed by the introduced histidine and adjacent tryptophan residue. Our findings concerning the mechanism of histidine-introduced interactions will provide a guideline for the rational design of pH-sensitive protein-protein recognition."

The plant cell wall consists mainly of a complex aggregation of polysaccharides, such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin. Hemicellulose is one of the most abundant renewable biopolymers on earth and constitutes an important source of energy for the biofuel industry. It represents 20–40% of plant biomass and is principally composed of pentoses, such as xylose and arabinose (1Saha B.C. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2003; 30: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). Due to the high complexity and structural variability of this polysaccharide, many enzymes are necessary for its complete degradation (2Ward O.P. Moo-Young M. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 1989; 8: 237-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A number of microorganisms are able to break down hemicellulose, through the action of various glycoside hydrolases (GHs). 2The abbreviations used are: GH, glycoside hydrolase; PACE, polysaccharide analysis using carbohydrate gel electrophoresis; DP, degree of polymerization; WT, wild type. 2The abbreviations used are: GH, glycoside hydrolase; PACE, polysaccharide analysis using carbohydrate gel electrophoresis; DP, degree of polymerization; WT, wild type. The latter catalyze the cleavage of glycosidic bonds between sugars with either inversion or retention of the anomeric configuration (3Koshland D.E. Biol. Rev. 1953; 28: 416-436Crossref Scopus (803) Google Scholar). GHs have been classified into more than 114 different families based on their amino acid sequence similarity (CAZY (Carbohydrate Active Enzymes) server, available on the World Wide Web) (4Henrissat B.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D233-D238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4067) Google Scholar). α-l-Arabinanases (EC 3.2.1.-) are accessory hemicellulases that hydrolyze α-l-arabinofuranosic linkages and act synergistically with other GHs to break down hemicellulose fully (6Margolles-Clark E. Tenkanen M. Nakari-Setala T. Penttila M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3840-3846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These enzymes have become of interest in recent years because of their potential rate-limiting role in the degradation of lignocelluloses and their practical application in various industrial processes, such as the production of important medicinal compounds, the improvement of wine flavors, pulp treatment, juice clarification, the production of bioethanol, and the synthesis of oligosaccharides (7Numan M.T. Bhosle N.B. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2006; 33: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). According to the CAZY classification, α-l-arabinanases are present in six GH families (3, 43, 51, 54, 62, and 93) whose members display highly varying specificities. GH51 and GH54 are the most extensively characterized and contain mainly α-l-arabinofuranosidases, removing both α-1,2 and α-1,3 arabinofuranosyl moieties from arabinan and xylans (8Hovel K.

Structure. 1999; 7: 179-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and those of GH62 are predicted to display the same five-bladed β-propeller fold (clan GHF) as the well documented GH43 family (14Nurizzo D. Turkenburg J.P. Charnock S.J. Roberts S.M. Dodson E.J. McKie V.A. Taylor E.J. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). GH93 is described as a family of exo-1,5-α-l-arabinanases in the CAZY data base. This family contains only few sequences obtained from bacterial and fungal genome sequencing, and the only characterized enzyme is Abnx, from Penicillium chrysogenum. Abxn cleaves arabinobiose from the nonreducing end of linear arabinan (15Sakamoto T. Thibault J.F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 3319-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Sakamoto T. Ihara H. Shibano A. Kasai N. Inui H. Kawasaki H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 560: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The products of its transglycosylation activity revealed net retention of the configuration of the anomeric carbon (22Sakamoto T. Fujita T. Kawasaki H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1674: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). GH93 is the only family of α-l-arabinanases for which neither structural nor detailed mechanistic information has been reported to date. Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph: Gibberella zeae) is a devastating pathogenic fungus that attacks various crop plants, such as maize, wheat, or barley. During the infection process, the fungus secretes a large and diverse panel of GHs that degrade the host cell wall. When F. graminearum grows in medium with plant cell wall material as the sole carbon source, as many as 11 CAZY families and 27 EC numbers are represented among the secreted enzymes (23Phalip V. Delalande F. Carapito C. Goubet F. Hatsch D. Leize-Wagner E. Dupree P. Dorsselaer A.V. Jeltsch J.M. Curr. Genet. 2005; 48: 366-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The diversity is particularly high for enzymes targeting hemicellulose, as recently shown by a transcriptional analysis revealing that 30 hemicellulase genes are transcribed in response to plant cell wall material (24Hatsch D. Phalip V. Petkovski E. Jeltsch J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 345: 959-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Two of these genes, fg03054.1 (in the F. graminearum genome data base (25Guldener U. Mannhaupt G. Munsterkotter M. Haase D. Oesterheld M. Stumpflen V. Mewes H.W. Adam G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D456-D458Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); GeneID: 2785867) and fg03598.1 (GeneID: 2784780) are predicted to encode an exo-1,5-α-l-arabinanase of family GH93. Sequence alignment against protein structure sequences shows similarities with enzymes of clan GHE, which includes families GH33, -34, and -83. This clan is characterized by a six-bladed β-propeller fold and contains only sialidases/neuraminidases (EC 3.2.1.18) or trans-sialidases (EC 2.4.1-). Sialidases, or neuraminidases, catalyze the removal of terminal sialic acid residues from various glycoconjugates and are involved in pathogenesis of many human diseases, including influenza and cholera (26Corfield T. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Here we report the production, biochemical characterization, and structural analysis of Arb93A, the exo-1,5-α-l-arabinanase from F. graminearum encoded by the gene fg03054.1. We describe the structure of the native enzyme and its complex with α-1,5-l-arabinobiose, which to our knowledge are the first crystal structures of a GH93 enzyme. Our data reveal that the enzyme binds linear α-1,5-l-arabinan and releases α-1,5-l-arabinobiose from the nonreducing end with net retention of the anomeric configuration. The catalytic residues identified through inspection of the active site were tested by site-directed mutagenesis. We propose a functional mechanism for α-1,5-l-arabinan hydrolysis and compare Arb93A structure with that of enzymes of the clan GHE. Substrates, Strains, and Media—p-Nitrophenyl α-l-arabinofuranoside was purchased from Sigma. Wheat arabinoxylan, sugar beet arabinan, sugar beet debranched α-1,5-l-arabinan, and α-1,5-l-arabino-oligosaccharides with degrees of polymerization (DP) ranging from 1 to 6 were obtained from Megazyme. F. graminearum (G. zeae) was originally isolated from diseased hops (Humulus lupulus) and identified by CABI Bioscience. F. graminearum was cultured at 23 °C on M3 medium (27Mitchell D.B. Vogel K. Weimann B.J. Pasamontes L. van Loon A.P. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) with hop cell wall as the sole carbon source at a concentration of 10 g/liter. The culture was performed as previously described (23Phalip V. Delalande F. Carapito C. Goubet F. Hatsch D. Leize-Wagner E. Dupree P. Dorsselaer A.V. Jeltsch J.M. Curr. Genet. 2005; 48: 366-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strains TOP10, XL1-Blue, and BL21 (DE3) (Invitrogen) were used for cloning procedures, site-directed mutagenesis, and protein expression, respectively. E. coli were grown in LB medium supplemented with 30 μg ml-1 kanamycin. RNA Isolation, cDNA Synthesis, and Cloning of arb93A—Total RNA was extracted from F. graminearum with the RNaqueous-4PCR kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized starting from the 3′-poly(A) of the mRNAs using the Smart cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech) and following the manufacturer's recommendations. The PCR products were directly used for amplification of arb93A with the primers 5′-ATCGGGTCTCCCATGAAGCCTGCCCAGAAGG-3′ and 5′-ATCGGGTCTCGAATTCTAAGACTTCATAACCTCAG-3′, incorporating BsaI restriction sites (underlined) for subsequent cloning. The amplification was carried out using iProof DNA polymerase (Bio-Rad). The resulting PCR product was purified on a Nucleospin device (Macherey-Nagel) and cloned into the pET30a+ plasmid (Novagen) previously digested with NcoI and EcoRI (Fermentas) using standard molecular biology procedures. The resulting pET30a-arb93A plasmid harbored the gene cloned in frame with the coding sequence of an N-terminal 6× histidine tag. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutants of Arb93A were generated using a PCR-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions and using pET30a-arb93A as template. The following primer pairs were used to generate the mutated genes: 5′-CCTCACTCCTGTCTGGGCCCCTTTCCTGATGACCTAC-3′ and 5′-GTAGGTCATCAGGAAAGGGGCCCAGACAGGAGTGAGG-3′ for E170A; 5′-CAACGAGTACATCTACGTCTATGCATATGGTGGTGGCCCTAACCC-3′ and 5′-GGGTTAGGGCCACCACCATATGCATAGACGTAGATGTACTCGTTG-3′ for E242A; 5′-GACGTTCCTCAGCCAACTGCGGCCACCCGTTCTCTCCTCACTTTC-3′ and 5′-GAAAGTGAGGAGAGAACGGGTGGCCGCAGTTGGCTGAGGAACGTC-3′ for Y337A. The mutant DNA sequences were validated by sequencing. Production of Recombinant Arb93A and Mutants—E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with pET30a+ containing the wild type (WT) or mutated arb93A gene were grown in 1 liter of LB-kanamycin, and protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an A600 nm of 0.6–0.8. Protein was produced for 16–18 h at 16 °C. A selenomethionine-substituted protein was produced according to the method of Doublie (28Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by centrifugation and sonicated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 25 mm imidazole. The lysate was subsequently centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 50 min and loaded onto a HisTrap HP 5-ml column (GE Healthcare) loaded with nickel sulfate and equilibrated in the aforementioned buffer. After washing with 100 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 50 mm imidazole, the protein was eluted with 15 ml of the same buffer supplemented with 500 mm imidazole. After a 3-fold dilution with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, the eluate was loaded onto a HiTrap Q-Sepharose Fast Flow 1-ml column (GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The flow-through containing the protein of interest was then directly loaded onto a HiTrap SP-Sepharose Fast Flow 1-ml column (GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated in the same buffer. Following a washing step with 30 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl, the protein was eluted with 6 ml of the same buffer supplemented with 500 mm NaCl. The N-terminal 6× histidine tag was cleaved overnight at room temperature with recombinant bovine enterokinase (Sigma) at 0.02 units/mg protein in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 5% glycerol in a final volume of 13 ml. The reaction mix was diluted 2.5-fold with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, passed through a HisTrap HP 5-ml column to remove uncleaved protein, and loaded onto a HiTrap SP-Sepharose Fast Flow 1-ml column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl. After washing with 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl, the protein was finally eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol in highly concentrated fractions that were directly used for crystallization experiments. The average production yield was 30 mg/liter. The purity was checked by SDS-PAGE. The selenomethionine-substituted protein was purified following the same protocol, except that all buffers were supplemented with 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Final elution was performed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Enzyme Activity Measurements—Specific activities were measured using 6.5 μm Arb93A and 0.5 mm substrate in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, at 40 °C during 2 h. To determine the specificity of the enzyme, various substrates were tested. For p-nitrophenyl-α-l-arabinofuranoside, the rate of p-nitrophenol formed was determined by quantification at 410 nm using p-nitrophenol as the standard (extinction coefficient: 7 × 103 mm-1 cm-1) (29Lee R.C. Hrmova M. Burton R.A. Lahnstein J. Fincher G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5377-5387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). For wheat arabinoxylan, sugar beet arabinan, and sugar beet debranched α-1,5-l-arabinan, the amount of reducing sugars released was determined with the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid method (30Miller G.L. Anal. Chem. 1959; 31: 426-428Crossref Scopus (21999) Google Scholar), using α-1,5-l-arabinobiose as a standard. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme releasing 1 μmol of α-1,5-l-arabinobiose equivalent/min. For the determination of pH and temperature optima, the reactions were performed with sugar beet debranched α-1,5-l-arabinan as substrate, buffers ranging from pH 3 to 9 and temperatures ranging from 20 to 60 °C. The enzyme was incubated with the substrate in 50 mm sodium acetate for pH 3, 4, and 5; 50 mm sodium phosphate for pH 6, 7, and 8; and 50 mm Tris-HCl for pH 9. Synthesis of Methyl Oligoarabinosides—The methyl-α-1,5-l-arabinotetraoside and methyl-α-1,5-l-arabinopentaoside used in NMR assays and crystallization trials were synthesized as described in the supplemental material, via protocols similar to those used for the preparation of other arabinofuranosides (31Joe M. Bai Y. Nacario R.C. Lowary T.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 9885-9901Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 32Yin H. D'Souza F.W. Lowary T.L. J. Org. Chem. 2002; 67: 892-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Kinetic Parameter Determination—Kinetic measurements were performed with α-1,5-l-arabinan and α-1,5-l-arabino-oligosaccharides with DPs ranging from 1 to 6 as substrate. Typical reaction conditions were 6.5 μm enzyme in a final volume of 22 μl of sodium acetate, pH 5, with substrate concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 35 mm. After 4 min at 40 °C, the reactions were stopped by heating to 95 °C. Twenty μl were then used for derivatization with 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (Molecular Probes) and analysis by polysaccharide analysis using carbohydrate gel electrophoresis (PACE), as described previously (33Carapito R. Carapito C. Jeltsch J.M. Phalip V. Bioresourse Technol. 2009; 100: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the intensities of bands were quantified with the QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad). Measurements were performed in duplicate. Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters were derived using nonlinear regression formulas of the Prism software (GraphPad). NMR Experiments—Substrate and buffers were exchanged by lyophilization at least twice from D2O. Exchange into deuterated buffer was performed for the enzyme by 10× dilutions and concentration on a Vivaspin 500 10 K (VivaSciences) three times. 1H NMR spectra were acquired with a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer operating at a frequency of 400.13 MHz in 5-mm NMR tubes. Spectra were recorded with 4006 Hz spectral width, 32,768 data points, 4.089 s acquisition time, 0.1 s relaxation delay, and up to 16 scans. A substrate reference spectrum was acquired before adding the enzyme, and two experiments were performed. 30 μl of 500 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and 2.5 m NaCl and 70 μl of protein concentrated to 9 mg ml-1 in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and 250 mm NaCl were added to 500 μl of methyl-α-1,5-l-arabinotetraoside to give a final concentration of 25.6 μm for the enzyme and 13.4 mm for the substrate. A spectrum was recorded after 5 min and then every 15 min for 3 h, and a final spectrum was recorded after 18 h at 25 °C. In the second experiment, 35 μl of enzyme concentrated to 7.8 mg ml-1 in 50 mm Tris-DCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl were added to 560 μl of methyl-α-1,5-l-arabinopentoside in the same buffer to give a final concentration of 11 μm for the enzyme and 11 mm for the substrate. A spectrum was recorded after 5 min and then every 5 min for 3 h and then every hour for 20 h at 20 °C. Integration was performed using the solvent peak (D2O) as reference, and an integral of 1 was used for one proton. Crystallization, Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement—Crystals were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using 2-μl drops containing a 50:50 (v/v) mix of reservoir solution combined with protein solution at 20 °C. Native crystals were obtained with a solution containing 10% polyethylene glycol 20000, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, and 100 mm MgCl2 and the protein at 7.8 mg ml-1. Selenomethionine crystals were obtained with a solution containing 25% polyethylene glycol 550MME, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and the protein at 11.6 mg ml-1. The complex was obtained after soaking selenomethionine-substituted crystals, obtained in 22% polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 50 mm ammonium sulfate, for 2 h at room temperature with 1 mm α-Me-1,5-arabinotetraose. 20% glycerol was added as cryoprotectant when necessary prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen at 100 K. Native, selenomethionine-substituted, and complex data were collected on a single crystal at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) on ID14-1, ID29, and ID14-2 beamlines, respectively, using ADSC detectors. Data were processed using XDS (34Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3218) Google Scholar) before being scaled and converted to structure factors using SCALA in the CCP4 suite program (35Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19734) Google Scholar). All further computing was performed using the CCP4 suite unless otherwise stated.

Blanc E. Roversi P. Bricogne G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 215-230Google Scholar). Five selenium positions were found and refined with a phasing power ANO of 0.877. Solvent flattening with an estimate of 48.2% solvent resulted in excellent and easily interpretable maps in which ARP/warp could build a first model (37Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). This model was used to solve the structure of the native protein by molecular replacement using AMORE (38Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The model was then updated with ARP/wARP. The complex structure was solved by molecular replacement using PHASER and the native coordinates as a search model (39McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Water molecules were introduced automatically using Coot and inspected manually. The stereochemical quality of the model was assessed with the program Procheck (42Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) prior to deposition in the Protein Data bank under the codes 2W5N and 2W5O for the native and complex structures, respectively. Details of the model quality are given in Table 1. All figures were drawn with the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA) unless stated otherwise. Cloning and Expression—The arb93A coding sequence isolated from RNA of F. graminearum was 1,146 bp in length and corresponded to 381 amino acids. The protein was predicted to harbor an N-terminal signal peptide with a cleavage site between Ala16 and Lys17. Therefore, only the DNA encoding the mature protein of 366 amino acids was cloned in pET30a+ for production in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The apparent molecular mass after purification was ∼40,000 Da, consistent with the theoretical value of 41,077 Da. A Blast search against sequences in the Protein Data Bank revealed that the closest structurally characterized protein to Arb93A was the sialidase from Micromonospora viridifaciens (Protein Data Bank code 1EUS) with 20.9% sequence identity (43Gaskell A. Crennell S. Taylor G. Structure. 1995; 3: 1197-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Activity Assay and Substrate Specificity—Enzymatic analysis at different pH and temperatures revealed an optimum activity at pH 5 and 40 °C. Fig. 1 summarizes the pH/temperature dependences of Arb93A. The protein is highly efficient in a large range of pH and temperature values; more than 80% of maximal activity is conserved at pH 4–6 and 30–50 °C. To determine the substrate specificity, the activity of Arb93A was measured on four different substrates (Table 2). The protein is not active on p-nitrophenyl α-l-arabinofuranoside, indicating that more than one arabinofuranose moiety is necessary for cleavage. This was confirmed by PACE analysis of the hydrolysis products from oligoarabinofuranoside substrates with DPs 2–6, showing that the lowest DP of the released sugars was 2 (data not shown). Arb93A is probably not able to cleave arabinose or arabino-oligosaccharide substitutions of a xylan backbone, because no activity was detected on wheat arabinoxylan."
https://openalex.org/W1984894634,"In animal models, the dysregulated activity of calcium-activated proteases, calpains, contributes directly to cataract formation. However, the physiological role of calpains in the healthy lens is not well defined. In this study, we examined the expression pattern of calpains in the mouse lens. Real time PCR and Western blotting data indicated that calpain 1, 2, 3, and 7 were expressed in lens fiber cells. Using controlled lysis, depth-dependent expression profiles for each calpain were obtained. These indicated that, unlike calpain 1, 2, and 7, which were most abundant in cells near the lens surface, calpain 3 expression was strongest in the deep cortical region of the lens. We detected calpain activities in vitro and showed that calpains were active in vivo by microinjecting fluorogenic calpain substrates into cortical fiber cells. To identify endogenous calpain substrates, membrane/cytoskeleton preparations were treated with recombinant calpain, and cleaved products were identified by two-dimensional difference electrophoresis/mass spectrometry. Among the calpain substrates identified by this approach was alphaII-spectrin. An antibody that specifically recognized calpain-cleaved spectrin was used to demonstrate that spectrin is cleaved in vivo, late in fiber cell differentiation, at or about the time that lens organelles are degraded. The generation of the calpain-specific spectrin cleavage product was not observed in lens tissue from calpain 3-null mice, indicating that calpain 3 is uniquely activated during lens fiber differentiation. Our data suggest a role for calpains in the remodeling of the membrane cytoskeleton that occurs with fiber cell maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2049893323,"Background Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF; palifermin) is a growth factor with a high degree of specificity for epithelial cells. KGF is an important effector of epithelial growth and tissue homeostasis in various organs including the pancreas. Here we investigated the intracellular signaling pathways involved in the mediation of pancreatic ductal cell proliferation and differentiation induced by exogenous KGF during beta-cell regeneration in diabetic rat. Methodology and Results In vitro and in vivo duct cell proliferation was measured by BrdU incorporation assay. The implication of MAPK-ERK1/2 in the mediation of KGF-induced cell proliferation was determined by inactivation of this pathway, using the pharmacological inhibitor or antisense morpholino-oligonucleotides against MEK1. In vivo KGF-induced duct cell differentiation was assessed by the immunolocalization of PDX1 and Glut2 in ductal cells and the implication of PI3K/AKT in this process was investigated. We showed that KGF exerted a potent mitogenic effect on ductal cells. Both in vitro and in vivo, its effect on cell proliferation was mediated through the activation of ERK1/2 as evidenced by the abolition of duct cell proliferation in the context of MEK/ERK inactivation. In vivo, KGF treatment triggered ductal cell differentiation as revealed by the expression of PDX1 and Glut2 in a subpopulation of ductal cells via a PI3K-dependent mechanism. Conclusion Here we show that KGF promotes beta-cell regeneration by stimulating duct cell proliferation in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrated for the first time that KGF directly induces the expression of PDX1 in some ductal cells thus inducing beta-cell neogenesis. We further explored the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes and showed that the effects of KGF on duct cell proliferation are mediated by the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway, while the KGF-induced cell differentiation is mediated by the PI3K/AKT pathway. These findings might have important implications for the in vivo induction of duct-to-beta cell neogenesis in patients with beta-cell deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1999042302,"Clearance of misfolded proteins by endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) requires concerted activity of chaperones, adaptor proteins, ubiquitin ligases, and proteasomes. RNF5 is a ubiquitin ligase anchored to the ER membrane implicated in ERAD via ubiquitination of misfolded proteins. Among RNF5-associated proteins is JNK-associated membrane protein (JAMP), a 7-transmembrane protein located within the ER membrane that facilitates degradation of misfolded proteins through recruitment of proteasomes and ERAD regulatory components. Here we demonstrate that RNF5 associates with JAMP in the ER membrane. This association results in Ubc13-dependent RNF5-mediated noncanonical ubiquitination of JAMP. This ubiquitination does not alter JAMP stability but rather inhibits its association with Rpt5 and p97. Consequently, clearance of misfolded proteins, such as CFTRDelta508 and T cell receptor alpha, is less efficient, resulting in their greater accumulation. Significantly, the RNF5 effect on JAMP is seen prior to and after ER stress response, thereby highlighting a novel mechanism to limit ERAD and proteasome assembly at the ER, to the actual ER stress response."
https://openalex.org/W1977622017,"T cell depleting strategies are an integral part of immunosuppressive regimens widely used in the hematological and solid organ transplant setting. Although it is known to induce lymphocytopenia, little is known about the effects of the polyclonal rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) or the monoclonal anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab on Natural Killer (NK) cells in detail. Here, we demonstrate that induction therapy with rATG following kidney/pancreas transplantation results in a rapid depletion of NK cells. Treatment of NK cells with rATG and alemtuzumab in vitro leads to impairment of cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis even at a 10-fold lower concentration (0.1 µg/ml) compared with T and B cells. By generating Fc-parts of rATG and alemtuzumab we illustrate that their ligation to FcγRIII (CD16) is sufficient for the significant induction of degranulation, apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine release (FasL, TNFα and IFNγ) exclusively in CD3−CD56dim NK cells whereas application of rATG and alemtuzumab F(ab) fragments abolishes these effects. These findings are of general importance as our data suggest that NK cells are also mediators of the clinically relevant cytokine release syndrome and that their targeting by therapeutic antibodies should be considered as they are functionally relevant for the effective clearance of opportunistic viral infections and anti-tumor activity posttransplantation."
https://openalex.org/W1993277692,"Malaria is one of the most severe problems faced by the world even today. Understanding the causative factors such as age, sex, social factors, environmental variability etc. as well as underlying transmission dynamics of the disease is important for epidemiological research on malaria and its eradication. Thus, development of suitable modeling approach and methodology, based on the available data on the incidence of the disease and other related factors is of utmost importance. In this study, we developed a simple non-linear regression methodology in modeling and forecasting malaria incidence in Chennai city, India, and predicted future disease incidence with high confidence level. We considered three types of data to develop the regression methodology: a longer time series data of Slide Positivity Rates (SPR) of malaria; a smaller time series data (deaths due to Plasmodium vivax) of one year; and spatial data (zonal distribution of P. vivax deaths) for the city along with the climatic factors, population and previous incidence of the disease. We performed variable selection by simple correlation study, identification of the initial relationship between variables through non-linear curve fitting and used multi-step methods for induction of variables in the non-linear regression analysis along with applied Gauss-Markov models, and ANOVA for testing the prediction, validity and constructing the confidence intervals. The results execute the applicability of our method for different types of data, the autoregressive nature of forecasting, and show high prediction power for both SPR and P. vivax deaths, where the one-lag SPR values plays an influential role and proves useful for better prediction. Different climatic factors are identified as playing crucial role on shaping the disease curve. Further, disease incidence at zonal level and the effect of causative factors on different zonal clusters indicate the pattern of malaria prevalence in the city. The study also demonstrates that with excellent models of climatic forecasts readily available, using this method one can predict the disease incidence at long forecasting horizons, with high degree of efficiency and based on such technique a useful early warning system can be developed region wise or nation wise for disease prevention and control activities."
https://openalex.org/W1964452168,"The modulation of cellular processes by small molecule inhibitors, gene inactivation, or targeted knockdown strategies combined with phenotypic screens are powerful approaches to delineate complex cellular pathways and to identify key players involved in disease pathogenesis. Using chemical genetic screening, we tested a library of known phosphatase inhibitors and identified several compounds that protected Bacillus anthracis infected macrophages from cell death. The most potent compound was assayed against a panel of sixteen different phosphatases of which CD45 was found to be most sensitive to inhibition. Testing of a known CD45 inhibitor and antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers targeting CD45 also protected B. anthracis-infected macrophages from cell death. However, reduced CD45 expression did not protect anthrax lethal toxin (LT) treated macrophages, suggesting that the pathogen and independently added LT may signal through distinct pathways. Subsequent, in vivo studies with both gene-targeted knockdown of CD45 and genetically engineered mice expressing reduced levels of CD45 resulted in protection of mice after infection with the virulent Ames B. anthracis. Intermediate levels of CD45 expression were critical for the protection, as mice expressing normal levels of CD45 or disrupted CD45 phosphatase activity or no CD45 all succumbed to this pathogen. Mechanism-based studies suggest that the protection provided by reduced CD45 levels results from regulated immune cell homeostasis that may diminish the impact of apoptosis during the infection. To date, this is the first report demonstrating that reduced levels of host phosphatase CD45 modulate anthrax pathogenesis.

Interactions between microbes and immune cells play a critical role in microbial pathogenesis. Many pathogenic organisms exploit the host immune machinery and subsequently modulate cell function, signaling, migration, and cytoskeleton rearrangement. Hence, identifying host cellular components with which microbes interact will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of microbial pathogenesis, define common strategies used by multiple pathogens, and elucidate unique tactics evolved by individual species to help establish infections or evade host innate responses. Another interesting aspect of infection is that diverse pathogens seem to target common cellular pathways (1Bhavsar A.P. Guttman J.A. Finlay B.B.

Thus, identifying host targets exploited by multiple pathogens will be useful in the development of broad-spectrum host-oriented therapeutics and vaccines.Protein kinases and phosphatases regulate a range of cellular responses to external and internal stimuli, including cell proliferation, metabolism, and apoptosis. Aberrant kinase and/or phosphatase activities underlie many different types of pathological conditions from cancer to infectious diseases. Protein kinases have been extensively investigated as targets for drug discovery. In addition, phosphatases are now being recognized as important regulators of many biological processes. In particular, there is an increasing interest in protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) 3The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; PMO, phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers; LF, lethal factor; MAPKK/MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; LT, lethal toxin; DiFMUP, 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate; PA, protective antigen; CFU, colony-forming units; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 3The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; PMO, phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers; LF, lethal factor; MAPKK/MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; LT, lethal toxin; DiFMUP, 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate; PA, protective antigen; CFU, colony-forming units; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. as drug targets (3Ducruet A.P.

The bacterial PTP YopH, secreted by Yersinia pestis, interferes with the host adhesion-regulated signaling pathway via dephosphorylation of selective tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (14Black D.S. Marie-Cardine A. Schraven B. Bliska J.B. Cell. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Activation of host PTPs after infection with bacteria or their virulence factors has been demonstrated for a diverse group of microorganisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Leishmania donovani (13Nandan D.

Specific mechanistic models of how PTPs contribute to the development of infection and disease progression by highly lethal organisms still remain unclear.Bacillus anthracis, a Gram-positive spore-forming bacterium, is the etiologic agent of anthrax. The lethal toxin (LT) produced by B. anthracis can cleave host cell mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKK), thereby affecting the immune response and the host ability to fight the infection (15Agrawal A. Pulendran B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2859-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 16Duesbery N.S. Webb C.P. Leppla S.H. Gordon V.M. Klimpel K.R. Copeland T.D. Ahn N.G. Oskarsson M.K.

This suggests that another cellular target(s) may play a role in anthrax pathogenesis.Previously, using a chemical genetic approach, we identified a class of Cdc25 inhibitors that protected macrophages from cell death induced by anthrax LT (22Panchal R.G.

Although Cdc25 was not the cellular target, induction of anti-apoptotic responses by the compounds via either the MAPK-dependent or -independent pathways was responsible for the protective phenotype.In the present study we investigated if the previously identified phosphatase inhibitors (22Panchal R.G.

Two compounds that previously protected LT-treated macrophages (22Panchal R.G. Ruthel G. Brittingham K.C. Lane D. Kenny T.A. Gussio R. Lazo J.S. Bavari S. Chem.

Subsequent in vitro phosphatase profiling studies identified CD45, a previously unknown target of one of the small molecules, as the most sensitive enzyme to the inhibitor. We then investigated the effect of CD45 reduction in anthrax pathogenesis both in cells and in vivo by using antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers and mice engineered to express reduced levels of CD45.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHeterozygous and Transgenic Mice—All mice in this study are of the C57BL/6 genetic background. C57BL/6 (CD45100%) wild type mice and exon-9-disrupted CD45 knock-out mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine). The heterozygous CD4562% mice have one exon 9 knock-out allele and one wild type allele. Transgenic mice containing a point mutation (C817S) in the membrane proximal phosphatase domain of the CD45 minigene were produced using a CD45 minigene construct containing cDNA for exons 1b-3, the genomic sequence from exon 3 to exon 9, which includes the variably spliced exons and surrounding introns, and cDNA from exon 9 through the polyadenylation signal region in exon 33, as described previously (23Virts E.L. Raschke W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19913-19920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24Virts E.L. Diago O. Raschke W.C. Blood. 2003; 101: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The minigene expresses CD45 in transgenic mice in the same leukocyte-restricted manner and with the same isoform regulation in leukocyte subsets as the endogenous gene (24Virts E.L. Diago O. Raschke W.C. Blood. 2003; 101: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The C817S mutation eliminates the catalytic site of the membrane proximal PTP domain and has been shown to abolish CD45 PTP activity in vitro (25Desai D.M. Sap J. Silvennoinen O. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4002-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which has been confirmed in ex vivo studies. 4E. L. Virts, N. Raschke, R. G. Panchal, S. Bavari and W. C. Raschke, manuscript in preparation. The CSV10 transgenic founder generated using the C817S mutant minigene was bred onto the exon-9-disrupted CD45 knock-out strain for seven generations to place the transgene on the CD45 knock-out and C57BL/6 backgrounds.The CD45 cell surface expression levels of heterozygous and CSV10+/- mice were determined with flow cytometry by comparison of the mean fluorescence intensities of the lymphocyte populations to those of CD45100% wild type and CD450% knock-out mice (24Virts E.L. Diago O. Raschke W.C. Blood. 2003; 101: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The expression level of CSV10 transgenic mice containing one copy of the transgene insertion locus (CSV10+/-) is 62–65%, a level similar to that expressed by CD4562% heterozygous mice.Chemical Library—A focused library of known phosphatase inhibitors and related napthoquinone- and dione-containing derivatives was used for screening (supplemental Table 1). These compounds were obtained from the NCI Open Chemical Repository, and their structures are available on the following web site, pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. The CD45 inhibitor (N-(9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydro-phenanthren-2-yl)-2,2-dimethyl propionamide) was obtained from Calbiochem, whereas its related analogs (phenanthrene-9,10 dione) and (4-nitrophenanthrene-9,10 dione) were obtained from Sigma.Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomer (PMO) Design and Synthesis—The sequence of the CD45 PMO targeting the translational start site is 5′-CCACAAACCCATGGTCATATC-3′. The scrambled PMO (5′-CGGACACACAAAAAGAAAGAAG-3′) was used as a nonbacterial negative control. For efficient delivery of PMOs into cells, an Arg-rich peptide (CH3CONH-(RAhxR)4-Ahx-βAla, designated P007; in which R stands for arginine, Ahx stands for 6-aminohexanoic acid, and βAla stands for β-alanine) was covalently conjugated to the 5′ end of the PMOs through a noncleavable piperazine linker. The methods for the syntheses of PMOs, the conjugation of P007, and the purification and analyses of P007-PMOs have all been described previously (26Moulton H.M. Nelson M.H. Hatlevig S.A. Reddy M.T.

Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1997; 7: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar).Phosphatase Activity Assay—Protein phosphatases were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). A generic substrate, DiFMUP (6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate), was purchased from Invitrogen. All assays were performed in 50 mm HEPES containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, with the following modifications or additions: SHP1, PTPMEG-2, and PTPβ (10 mm MgCl2); PP1α, PP1β, and PP2A (10 mm MnCl2); HePTP, VHR, CD45, TC-PTP, SHP-2, LMPTPA (pH 4.5), and LMPTPB (pH 4.5); PTPMEG-1 (4.8 mm MgCl2 and 3.2 mm MnCl2); PTP-1B (25 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 2.5 mm EDTA). Compound (10 μm) was added to 15 μl of enzyme and incubated for 10 min followed by 10 μl of DiFMUP at a final concentration of 100 μm. The 384-well plate was incubated at room temperature for 60 min and then read in an Analyst (MDC using excitation 360 nm; emission 450 nm). The effect of the compound was compared with control wells containing DMSO (1%). The different phosphatase enzyme characteristics and their concentrations used in this assay have been detailed in supplemental Table 2.Cdc25B phosphatase activity was measured as described previously (22Panchal R.G.

Briefly, an assay mixture containing 30 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.033% bovine serum albumin, I mm dithiothreitol, 40 μm 3-O-methyl fluorescein phosphate, and 0.7 μg/ml His-Cdc25B catalytic domain (a kind gift from Dr. John Lazo, University of Pittsburgh) was incubated with NSC 95397 in DMSO or DMSO (control) for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by adding 100 mm NaOH, and the increase in fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission wavelength of 530 nm.To measure CD45 phosphatase activity in protein lysates, equal concentrations of total protein (200 μg) from untreated or PMO-treated macrophages (8 μm, 72 h treatment) were first precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads and then immunoprecipitated overnight with either the nonspecific monoclonal antibody or CD45-specific (clone 30-F11, BD Biosciences) antibody in the presence of protein G beads. After washing, the beads were incubated with 100 μm DiFMUP substrate in 100 μl of assay buffer for 1 h. Supernatant was transferred into 96-well plates, and fluorescence intensity was measured at excitation 358 nm and emission 455 nm. The experiments were repeated independently at least three times. The results are given as averages with S.D.Flow Cytometry—Antibodies used for fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis were purchased from BD Pharmingen unless otherwise noted. Antibodies used were directly conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate, phycoerythrin (PE), allophycocyanin (APC), peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP), or PECy5. Clones used in these studies included CD45 (30-F11), CD3 (17A2), CD4 (RM4–5), CD8 (53-6.7), CD11b (M1/70), CD11c (N418, eBioscience), CD19 (1D3), NK1.1 (PK136, eBioscience), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I (28-14-8), MHC II (M5/114.15.2), CD44 (IM7), and Ly6G (1A8). Cells (1 × 106) were resuspended in Fc block (anti CD16/CD32 antibody diluted in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum), incubated on ice for 30 min, centrifuged, and stained with appropriate combinations of labeled antibodies. After incubation on ice for 60 min, cells were washed and resuspended in 10% formaldehyde. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis was performed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using FlowJo software.Cell Viability Assay of B. anthracis-infected Macrophages— To test the effects of compounds on cell viability after B. anthracis infection, J774A.1 cells (6 × 105) were pretreated with DMSO (1%) control or compound (10 μm). After 1 h cells were infected with Sterne spores of B. anthracis (5 m.o.i.). After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, bacterial growth was inhibited by the addition of the antibiotics penicillin (100 IU) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). To determine cell viability sytox green nucleic acid stain (1 μm, Molecular Probes), which is impermeant to live cells, was added and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 2 min and then washed 2 times with complete medium containing antibiotics. The cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min and then analyzed by flow cytometry.To test the effects of CD45 knock-down on cell viability after B. anthracis infection, J774A.1 cells (6 × 105) were either left untreated or treated with CD45 or SC PMOs. After 72 h cells were harvested and infected with the Sterne spores (5 m.o.i.). After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, cell viability was measured by the uptake of sytox green dye (as described above).Immunoblot Analysis—J774A.1 cells (∼1 × 106) seeded in a 6-well plate were either left untreated or incubated with CD45 or scrambled PMO for 72 h. Cells were harvested and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The cell lysates were incubated for 30 min on ice and then centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 rpm. Cell extracts (30 μg) were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE and then subjected to Western blotting. A CD45-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 69, BD Pharmingen) was used to detect the immunoreactive proteins that were visualized by Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL).To determine the MEK cleavage pattern, J774A.1 cells were treated with the CD45 or scrambled PMOs (8 μm) for 72 h. Cells were harvested and then treated with anthrax lethal toxin (100 ng/ml Protective antigen (PA83) and 20 ng/ml of lethal factor (LF)) or infected with B. anthracis Sterne spores (5 m.o.i.). After a 4-h incubation time, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), lysed, and electrophoresed as described above. Western blots were probed with MEK1“NT” antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase for uniform protein loading and visualized by ECL.Animal Studies— 8–10-Week-old mice were used in this study and included both males and females. For in vivo B. anthracis studies, C57BL/6 wild type control (CD45100%), CD4562%, CD4511%, CD4536%, CD450%, and CSV10+/- mice were challenged via an intraperitoneal route with ∼300 colonyforming units (CFU) of Ames strain of B. anthracis. The mice were monitored for 1 month post-challenge.To test the efficacy of PMOs in vivo, BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks old, n = 6) were pretreated via subcutaneous route with PBS or CD45 PMO or scrambled PMO for 2 days (days -2 and -1). On the third day (day 0), the mice were treated with the PMOs and infected via intraperitoneal route with Ames spores (∼750 CFU). An additional PBS or PMO treatment was given the day after challenge (day 1). Non-tagged PMOs were used for in vivo studies and injected at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day. The mice were monitored for 1 month post-challenge. B. anthracis Ames spores from the same batch were used for all the in vivo mouse studies described in Fig. 4 and 5.FIGURE 5Mice expressing intermediate CD45 levels survive B. anthracis infection. A, mice with intermediate CD45 expression levels (62%) challenged with Ames B. anthracis spores showed a 65% survival rate. In contrast, CD45100%, CD450%, CD4511%, CD4536%, or CSV10+/- (62%) mice with inactive CD45 phosphatase activity showed little to no protection after B. anthracis challenge.

After 35 days, mice were euthanized, blood was collected, and protective antigen (PA)-specific antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.All research was conducted under an approved protocol and in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and other federal statutes and regulations related to animals and experiments involving animals and adhered to principles stated in the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals,” National Research Council 1996. The facility where this research was conducted is fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of laboratory Animal Care International.Phagocytosis and Spore Viability—To enumerate the spores ingested by macrophages, thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages from CD45 100, 62, and 0% mice were infected with 5 m.o.i. of green fluorescent protein-Sterne spores and plate-centrifuged to synchronize the infection. After 30 min non-permeabilized cells were incubated with a mix of antibodies specific for B. anthracis spore exosporium (to label extracellular spores) and Bacillus polysaccharide (to label extracellular vegetative bacilli) (kindly provided by T. Abshire and J. Ezzel, United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases) followed by a secondary incubation with antibody conjugated to Alexa-594-nm fluorophore. This method labels only those spores adhered to the outside surface of the macrophages. After fixation with formaldehyde, cells were stained with Hoechst dyes, and images from nine sites/well were collected and analyzed using the Discovery-1 high content screening system (Molecular Devices, Downington, PA). Images were analyzed using the cell health module of MataXpress imaging analysis software. Total cell count was based on the number of Hoechst-stained cell nuclei, whereas co-localization of red (anti-spore and anti-bacterial antibody) and green (green fluorescent protein-Sterne spores) fluorescence was scored as spores being on the outside of the cell and with green-only fluorescence being scored as ingested spores.To measure spore viability, thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages purified by plastic adherence were infected with Sterne spores at an m.o.i. of 5. After 30 min cell pellets collected by centrifugation were lysed in sterile water and serially diluted, and aliquots were plated onto solid LB agar medium plates, which were then incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. CFU were counted, and data are represented as CFU/ml. Experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated three independent times.Macrophage Apoptosis—Thioglycolate elicited peritoneal macrophages from 100 or 62% CD45 expressor mice were either left untreated or infected with Sterne B. anthracis spores (10 m.o.i.) or staurosporine (2 μm) as a positive control. After 6 h, macrophage apoptosis was measured using the Apo-One Homogeneous Caspase 3/7 kit (Promega), as per the manufacturer instructions.Cytotoxicity Assay—J774A.1 macrophages (5 × 104) were either left untreated or treated with scrambled control or CD45 PMO (5 μm). After 72 h cells were treated with 100 ng/ml PA83 and 20 ng/ml LF, a toxin concentration that results in 80–90% killing of macrophages. After 4 h 25 μl of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (1 mg/ml) dye was added, and cells were further incubated for 2 h. The reaction was stopped by adding equal volume of lysis buffer (50% N,N-dimethylformamide and 20% SDS, pH 4.7). Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and cell viability was determined by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm in a multiwell plate reader.Antibacterial Growth Inhibition Assay—B. anthracis Sterne spores (5 × 105 CFU/ml) diluted in Mueller-Hinton broth were treated with either DMSO control or compounds NSC 95397 (10 μm) or NSC 270012 (10 μm). At time intervals of 2, 5, 7, and 24 h, absorbance at 600 nm was measured. Experiments were done in duplicate and repeated at least two independent times.Immunohistochemical Staining—To detect the presence of bacilli in infected tissues, the EnVision system (Dako) was used. Briefly, tissue sections were deparaffinized, blocked in methanol/H2O2 solution for 30 min at room temperature, rinsed with water, pretreated with Tris-EDTA, pH 9.0, at 97 °C for 30 min, and then blocked with mouse IgG blocking buffer (Vector Laboratories, 1:20). The tissues were then incubated with mouse anti-capsule antibody (#593) or mouse IgG as negative control serum for 30 min at room temperature. After rinsing 3 times with PBS, peroxidase-labeled polymer conjugated to goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins was added and incubated for 30 min. After rinsing with PBS, substrate-chromogen solution was added and incubated for 5 min. Tissues were then rinsed with PBS, stained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted with Permount.RESULTSChemical Genetic Screening and Phosphatase Profiling—To assess whether inhibition of host phosphatase function would elicit protection against B. anthracis-induced cell death, a chemical genetic approach was used wherein a focused library of known Cdc25 phosphatase inhibitors (22Panchal R.G.

The tight association of hematopoietic cells and blood vessel endothelia, as seen in yolk sac blood islands, has long suggested a developmental relationship between the two lineages, leading to the proposal of a common progenitor, the hemangioblast. A VEGF-R2-positive progenitor, capable of differentiating into either endothelial or hematopoietic cells depending on the growth factors in the culture medium, can indeed be isolated from the caudal mesoderm of the gastrulating avian embryo (Eichmann et al., 1997Eichmann A. Corbel C. Nataf V. Vaigot P. Bréant C. Le Douarin N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 5141-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), mouse embryo (Huber et al., 2004Huber T.L. Kouskoff V. Fehling H.J. Palis J. Keller G. Nature. 2004; 432: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), or murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (Choi et al., 1998Choi K. Kennedy M. Kazarov A. Papadimitriou J.C. Keller G. Development. 1998; 125: 725-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative theory is that hematopoietic cells originate from a specific type of endothelium designated as hemogenic. Indeed, transient, time-specific, hemogenesis arising at the floor of aortic endothelium is prominent in embryos of many vertebrate species. An elegant study recently delineated in vivo the hemogenic potential of the mouse embryo aorta, vitelline, and umbilical arteries, hereafter collectively designated as aorta (Zovein et al., 2008Zovein A.C. Hofmann J.J. Lynch M. French W.J. Turlo K.A. Yang Y. Becker M.S. Zanetta L. Dejana E. Gasson J.C. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Transgenic animals carrying an inducible VE-cadherin Cre gene were crossed with a ROSA26R Cre reporter line. A short pulse of tamoxifen, delivered at the stage of “AGM” hemogenesis, induced CRE, labeling permanently only the endothelium present at this time and its progeny. As development progressed, abundant labeled hematopoietic cells were detected in the fetal liver, the bone marrow, and the thymus. Long-term multilineage blood cell production, an essential hallmark of HSCs, is thus an attribute of cells derived from the aortic endothelium. The mouse line created by these authors offers a powerful tool to study the involvement of different developmental stages of endothelium in the emergence of HSCs. Given that hematopoiesis occurs sequentially in different embryonic sites, it will be interesting to see this transgenic system used again to target the endothelium at different periods and thus assess other putative sites of hemogenesis. Two current Nature articles take an in vitro approach to examine the emergence of hematopoietic cells from endothelial populations derived from ESC cultures. One reports a fine-tuned, continuous live analysis of hematopoietic production from a hemogenic intermediate over time (Eilken et al., 2009Eilken H.M. Nishikawa S.-I. Shroeder T. Nature. 2009; 457: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In this study, the authors use a sorted-out population of VEGF-R2+ and E-cadherin− ESC-derived cells that arise after 4 days in differentiation conditions, and cultured them on OP9 stromal cells. Single-cell progeny was followed by time-lapse microscopy. The changes in molecular markers, monitored on the living cells, strikingly correlated with the evolution of the cells from an adherent endothelial morphology to a nonadherent blood cell morphology (Figure 1). In the second study, a similar population of ESC-derived hemangioblasts gave rise to “blast colonies” after 36–48 hr comprised of both endothelial and a few hematopoiesis-committed (CD41+) cells (Lancrin et al., 2009Lancrin C. Sroczynska P. Stephenson C. Allen T. Kouskoff V. Lacaud G. Nature. 2009; 457: 892-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Over time, the latter population became predominant in the culture and began expressing CD45. The switch from the tight adherent (endothelial) to the detached (hematopoietic) phenotype, visualized through time-lapse photography, corresponded with the evolution of flow cytometry profiles observed in parallel (Figure 1). ESCs deficient in the transcription factors SCL, required for both primitive and definitive hemopoiesis, or Runx1, dispensable for primitive hematopoiesis but necessary for definitive hemopoiesis, were also examined. Production of CD41+ cells from Runx1−/− ESCs was drastically reduced, though clusters of adherent cells and a few blast colonies did appear. However, if a doxycycline-inducible Runx1 construct was inserted in the mutant cells, CD41+ cells were generated upon induction. In contrast, SCL−/− ESCs assayed in this system resulted in the total absence of either blast or adherent colonies. Thus there appear to be two discrete stages of differentiation downstream of the hemangioblast: SCL-dependent Tie2+/c-Kit+/CD41− “tight” colonies and CD41+ blast colonies that require Runx1. Thus, the Eilken study dissects the live progress of hemogenic endothelial cells, whereas the Lancrin results delineate some of the molecular features of the cellular intermediates and also define and dissociate two closely knit stages in the process. In both studies, the authors confirmed their findings by culturing cells isolated from yolk sac-containing gastrulating embryos, supporting the conclusion that hemogenesis requires an endothelial transition. Consistent with the model and results described above, a third Nature paper (Chen et al., 2009Chen M.J. Yokomizo T. Zeigler B.M. Dzierzak E. Speck N.A. Nature. 2009; 457: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) recently reported that Runx1 activity in VE-cadherin-expressing cells is required for a brief, discrete period for the emergence of HSCs from endothelium, and yet Runx1 becomes dispensable after their progeny commit to hematopoiesis. Interestingly, this paper disclosed that the vast majority of adult blood cells was derived from cells that expressed VE-Cad during their life history, thus confirming the data presented by Zovein et al., 2008Zovein A.C. Hofmann J.J. Lynch M. French W.J. Turlo K.A. Yang Y. Becker M.S. Zanetta L. Dejana E. Gasson J.C. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar. Putting all of the recent studies together brings us to make a series of comments. First, although hematopoiesis appears required, as indicated by the molecular constraints, to passage through an endothelial stage, this transition is cytologically prominent only in the aorta and associated arteries. Also, while the concept of “hemogenic endothelium” was coined based on histological observations within the aorta, the data discussed here and elsewhere (for review, see Yoshimoto et al., 2008Yoshimoto M. Porayette P. Yoder M.C. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 4: 583-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (21) Google Scholar) seem to indicate that definitive hematopoiesis in the yolk sac also derives from a hemogenic endothelium. Second, it is important to recall that while the hierarchy of blood cells has been worked out in the murine system, paving the way for human cell studies, hematopoietic ancestor-progeny relationships were first established in the avian model (Eichmann et al., 1997Eichmann A. Corbel C. Nataf V. Vaigot P. Bréant C. Le Douarin N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 5141-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, Jaffredo et al., 1998Jaffredo T. Gautier R. Eichmann A. Dieterlen-Lièvre F. Development. 1998; 125: 4575-4583PubMed Google Scholar), which is uniquely effective in lineage-tracing studies. Finally, it was in avian studies that the distinction between nonhemogenic (dorsal) and hemogenic (ventral) endothelia was established (Pardanaud et al., 1996Pardanaud L. Luton D. Prigent M. Bourcheix L.-M. Catala M. Dieterlen-Lièvre F. Development. 1996; 122: 1363-1371PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, an important challenge facing the field is to dissect the molecular constraints responsible for limiting the blood-forming potential of distinct endothelial cells. Of note, according to Eilken et al., 2009Eilken H.M. Nishikawa S.-I. Shroeder T. Nature. 2009; 457: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, only 1 in 3000 ESC-derived colonies is hemogenic. In addition to informing the immediate field of developmental hematopoiesis, one might ask whether it is important to dissect the process of HSC emergence with such fine-tuned precision. Indeed it is, in part because the transcription factors required during the earliest stages of hematopoietic lineage maturation (SCL, Runx1, Vav) have all been implicated in various types of leukemia. In addition, from a historical perspective, blood cell studies have defined many of the concepts and techniques that have since been applied across the field of stem cell research, and thus decoding the early stages of commitment will likely also advance the field of cell therapy. In particular, a critical—yet unanswered—issue concerns the developmental program that determines the point past which stem cells, hematopoietic or otherwise, can no longer be produced. The recently described in vivo models appear poised to reveal essential details about this important point. At the same time, the in vitro explorations disclose the cellular steps and molecular combinations involved in the emergence of a population of cells that are central to promoting stem cell therapy and cancer treatments."

Here we report the first structure of an archaeal member of a new self-compartmentalizing protease family forming a cubic-shaped octamer with D(4) symmetry and referred to as CubicO. We solved the structure of the Pyrococcus abyssi Pab87 protein at 2.2 A resolution using the anomalous signal of the high-phasing-power lanthanide derivative Lu-HPDO3A. A 20 A wide channel runs through this supramolecular assembly of 0.4 MDa, giving access to a 60 A wide central chamber holding the eight active sites. Surprisingly, activity assays revealed that Pab87 degrades specifically d-amino acid containing peptides, which have never been observed in archaea. Genomic context of the Pab87 gene showed that it is surrounded by genes involved in the amino acid/peptide transport or metabolism. We propose that CubicO proteases are involved in the processing of d-peptides from environmental origins."

Kulp A.N. Qian D. Lam J.S. Ailles L.E.

Their studies provide a link between the management of ROS by CSCs and enhanced tumor radioresistance. In 1956, Denham Harman proposed the “free radical theory of aging,” hypothesizing that cumulative effects of ROS on DNA, proteins, and membranes determine the life span of an organism (Harman, 1956Harman D. J. Gerontol. 1956; 11: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (6049) Google Scholar). In addition, it is now well established that many adult tissues require stem cells for their maintenance, and organismal longevity is thought to be dependent in part on the maintenance of different tissue stem cell pools. It has thus been suggested that effective management of ROS in normal tissue stem cells may contribute to their fitness, and hence the life span of the organism. But what might happen if this investment in ROS management by normal stem cells were commandeered by a renegade group of cells with the capacity to initiate and propagate cancer? Might this engender systemic collapse of the entire organism? In the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment, protection from oxidative stress is critical for the maintenance of self-renewal. For example, mice deficient in the Atm kinase or FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4 transcription factors exhibit elevated ROS levels in the HSC compartment that result in a rapid extinction of HSCs. Furthermore, the demise of these mutant HSCs can be reverted by in vivo antioxidant therapy (Ito et al., 2004Ito K. Hirao A. Arai F. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Hamaguchi I. Nomiyama K. Hosokawa K.

Sears C. et al.Cell. 2007; 128: 325-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar), indicating a causal link between ROS and HSC longevity. However, protection of HSC from the accumulation of ROS is abandoned with the transition of HSC to myeloid progenitors. This developmental transition is associated with an ∼100-fold increase in ROS, and enables the mature progeny of non-self-renewing myeloid progenitors to engage their role as professional generators of ROS with bactericidal intent (Tothova et al., 2007Tothova Z. Kollipara R. Huntly B.J. Lee B.H. Castrillon D.H. Cullen D.E. McDowell E.P. Lazo-Kallanian S. Williams I.R. Sears C. et al.Cell. 2007; 128: 325-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). Diehn et al. now extend this paradigm into the realm of epithelial tissue stem cells. In their elegant report, the authors demonstrate developmental regulation of ROS levels in the context of mammary epithelial stem cells and their progeny. They convincingly demonstrate that human and mouse breast CSCs, similar to their normal tissue counterparts, maintain low levels of ROS that afford radioprotection, providing a possible explanation for tumor recurrence with therapy (Diehn et al., 2009Diehn M. Cho R.W. Lobo N.A. Kalisky T. Dorie M.J. Kulp A.N. Qian D. Lam J.S. Ailles L.E. Wong M. et al.Nature. 2009; (Published online February 4, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Diehn et al. made the initial observation that a population of murine mammary repopulating unit (MRU)-enriched cells harbors lower levels of ROS and mitochondrial superoxide than do murine mammary progenitor cells, further emphasizing the importance of low levels of physiologic oxidative stress among different tissue stem cell compartments. They extended these findings to breast CSCs and addressed whether CSCs also have mechanisms that protect them from detrimental effects of oxidative stress. There are several reasons why this issue may be of particular relevance to CSCs. First, the cell of origin of CSCs may influence the levels of ROS and the transcriptional programs available for ROS management. For example, if a CSC population arose from committed progenitors in either the breast epithelial compartment or the myeloid progenitor compartment, endogenous ROS would be predicted to be higher than if CSCs arose from a stem cell. Second, CSCs demonstrate activation of signaling pathways that result in increased production of ROS and extinction of normal stem cells, such as the PI3K/AKT axis that results in inactivation of FoxO. Thus, CSCs may have mechanisms for protection from ROS, either through activation or reactivation of physiologic mechanisms that maintain low levels of ROS, or development of resistance to predicted detrimental effects of high ROS on self-renewal of CSCs. Diehn et al., 2009Diehn M. Cho R.W. Lobo N.A. Kalisky T. Dorie M.J. Kulp A.N. Qian D. Lam J.S. Ailles L.E. Wong M. et al.Nature. 2009; (Published online February 4, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar provide evidence that the former is the case in the context of mammary CSCs. First, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using microarray expression data sets derived from human breast CSC-enriched populations (ESA+CD44+CD24−/low Lin−) or nontumorigenic breast cancer cells (“NTCs,” CD24+Lin−) shows that genes involved in ROS metabolism, including glutathione peroxidase 1 and 4, superoxide dismutase 2, and catalase, are enriched in CSCs. Furthermore, enrichment of antioxidant gene expression correlates with lower levels of ROS in human breast CSC-enriched populations relative to NTCs, although ROS expression levels were heterogeneous within both populations of cells. In addition, a CSC-enriched population derived from an MMTV-Wnt1 murine model of spontaneous breast cancer exhibits lower overall levels of ROS than NTCs. However, transplantation of both low-ROS and high-ROS CSC-enriched populations gives rise to tumors, and a higher tumor-forming efficiency was noted in the high-ROS group. These data are somewhat perplexing and argue that in this setting, levels of ROS do not correlate with transplantability of the CSC population. This finding also stands in contrast with the hematopoietic system, at least in the context of nonmalignant HSCs (Ito et al., 2006Ito K. Hirao A. Arai F. Takubo K. Matsuoka S. Miyamoto K. Ohmura M. Naka K. Hosokawa K. Ikeda Y. Suda T. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, Tothova et al., 2007Tothova Z. Kollipara R. Huntly B.J. Lee B.H. Castrillon D.H.

Although deleterious effects of ROS include induction of DNA damage and genetic instability, certain ROS also regulate a variety of cellular functions (reviewed in Veal et al., 2007Veal E.A. Day A.M. Morgan B.A. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 1-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). To assess the physiological relevance of low levels of ROS in breast CSCs, Diehn et al., 2009Diehn M. Cho R.W. Lobo N.A. Kalisky T. Dorie M.J. Kulp A.N. Qian D. Lam J.S. Ailles L.E. Wong M. et al.Nature. 2009; (Published online February 4, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar examined the propensity of breast CSC-enriched populations to develop DNA damage after ionizing radiation (IR). They observed that CSC-enriched populations accumulate fewer DNA single- and double-strand breaks after in vitro and in vivo irradiation. In addition, the decrease in DNA damage correlates with increased persistence of the CSC-enriched population, consistent with the model that ROS modulates radioresistance of the CSC population. Furthermore, radioprotection in the CSC-enriched population is linked to expression of genes involved in glutathione synthesis, including glutamate cysteine ligase (Gclm), glutathione synthetase (Gss), and FoxO1, but not FoxO4, Hif1α, or Epas1. In addition, depletion of GSH in CSC via treatment with buthionine sulphoximine (BSO) results in decreased colony-forming ability and radiosensitization (Figure 1). In contrast, pretreatment with the antioxidant tempol protects NTCs from radiation-induced death to the same extent as that of the CSC-enriched population. Additional key mediators of ROS induction and genomic stability identified in other tissue stem cell contexts also warrant further investigation, including ATM, FoxO3, p53, p66Shc, NRF2-ARE, and p38MAPK, among others. In addition, it will be of interest to determine the contribution of microenvironmental regulation of ROS and genomic instability in this context. For example, expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) in breast tumors is implicated in increased production of ROS with resultant DNA damage and genomic instability (Radisky et al., 2005Radisky D.C. Levy D.D. Littlepage L.E. Liu H. Nelson C.M. Fata J.E. Leake D. Godden E.L. Albertson D.G. Nieto M.A. et al.Nature. 2005; 436: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Microenvironmental contribution to these processes could potentially explain the heterogeneity in ROS levels that was observed in the CSC-enriched population in the aforementioned experiments. Finally, it remains to be determined whether differential expression of ROS in breast CSCs versus NTCs may serve additional regulatory functions. For example, ROS has been implicated in activation of signaling pathways in response to cytokines, such as differentiation or induction of apoptosis. Taken together, these intriguing findings suggest that the self-renewal potential of CSCs in different tissues may be exquisitely sensitive to levels of reactive oxygen, and that the redox state may be intimately linked to resistance to IR. If so, this liability might represent a CSC “Achilles' heel” for future therapeutic exploitation. Indeed, there is evidence suggesting that treatment of human AML stem and progenitor cells with parthenolide, a naturally occurring molecule that induces ROS, preferentially targets AML cells and induces robust apoptosis (Guzman et al., 2005Guzman M.L. Rossi R.M. Karnischky L. Li X. Peterson D.R. Howard D.S. Jordan C.T. Blood. 2005; 105: 4163-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen whether CSCs in other tissue compartments maintain low levels of ROS or whether they utilize other protective mechanisms to “bail out” the population from metabolic debts accumulated over time. A more thorough mechanistic understanding of these observations may inform the pursuit of improved therapeutic targeting of this critical tumor cell population."
https://openalex.org/W2022163445,"Background There is increasing interest in developing human cell lines to be used to better understand cell biology, but also for drug screening, toxicology analysis and future cell therapy. In the endocrine pancreatic field, functional human beta cell lines are extremely scarce. On the other hand, rodent insulin producing beta cells have been generated during the past years with great success. Many of such cell lines were produced by using transgenic mice expressing SV40T antigen under the control of the insulin promoter, an approach clearly inadequate in human. Our objective was to develop and validate in rodent an alternative transgenic-like approach, applicable to human tissue, by performing somatic gene transfer into pancreatic progenitors that will develop into beta cells. Methods and Findings In this study, rat embryonic pancreases were transduced with recombinant lentiviral vector expressing the SV40T antigen under the control of the insulin promoter. Transduced tissues were next transplanted under the kidney capsule of immuno-incompetent mice allowing insulinoma development from which beta cell lines were established. Gene expression profile, insulin content and glucose dependent secretion, normalization of glycemia upon transplantation into diabetic mice validated the approach to generate beta cell lines. Conclusions Somatic gene transfer into pancreatic progenitors represents an alternative strategy to generate functional beta cell lines in rodent. Moreover, this approach can be generalized to derive cells lines from various tissues and most importantly from tissues of human origin."
https://openalex.org/W1966041905,"Background Nucleosome free regions (NFRs) play important roles in diverse biological processes including gene regulation. A genome-wide quantitative portrait of each individual NFR, with their starting and ending positions, lengths, and degrees of nucleosome depletion is critical for revealing the heterogeneity of gene regulation and chromatin organization. By averaging nucleosome occupancy levels, previous studies have identified the presence of NFRs in the promoter regions across many genes. However, evaluation of the quantitative characteristics of individual NFRs requires an NFR calling method. Methodology In this study, we propose a statistical method to identify the patterns of NFRs from a genome-wide measurement of nucleosome occupancy. This method is based on an appropriately designed segmental semi-Markov model, which can capture each NFR pattern and output its quantitative characterizations. Our results show that the majority of the NFRs are located in intergenic regions or promoters with a length of about 400–600bp and varying degrees of nucleosome depletion. Our quantitative NFR mapping allows for an investigation of the relative impacts of transcription machinery and DNA sequence in evicting histones from NFRs. We show that while both factors have significant overall effects, their specific contributions vary across different subtypes of NFRs. Conclusion The emphasis of our approach on the variation rather than the consensus of nucleosome free regions sets the tone for enabling the exploration of many subtler dynamic aspects of chromatin biology."

Here, we examine the results of the first two ERC calls for research grants and discuss the latest developments and the challenges that face this unique research council. In 2007, the European Research Council (ERC) was launched amid much fanfare with the goal of spearheading Europe's aspirations to become the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based society in the world. Here, we examine the results of the first two ERC calls for research grants and discuss the latest developments and the challenges that face this unique research council. Europe can compete in the global economy only by being a leading knowledge-based society. With natural resources and cheap labor in short supply, the continent must commandeer its human capital by sustaining, retaining, and attracting talent to perform pioneering research and to promote innovation. For Europe, investing in the “knowledge triangle”—education, research, and innovation—is not an option but a necessity. The European Research Council (ERC) is an independent agency funding cutting-edge (frontier) research across Europe in all disciplines, from the biological and physical sciences to engineering and the humanities. It was formally launched in February 2007 within the scope of the European Treaty, as an innovative component of the European Union's (EU) 7th Framework Programme. Created to provide a new source and philosophy for competitive funding, based on excellence as the sole criterion for success, the ERC is setting new standards and creating a level playing field for research across a diverse continent of 600 million people in 39 countries with a collective economy of €15 trillion. The ERC is an inclusive institution that seeks excellence irrespective of nationality, gender, or location and monitors the demographics of its applicants and grantees to optimize procedures for equitable treatment. The ERC is governed by the Scientific Council (ScC), consisting of 22 eminent European scientists and supported operationally by a Dedicated Implementation Structure (DIS), based in Brussels (Simons and Featherstone, 2005Simons K. Featherstone C. Cell. 2005; 123: 747-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar; http://erc.europa.eu/pdf/ERC_Annual_Report.pdf). The ScC is responsible for determining strategy and specifying schemes for the granting of research funds and has put in place the ERC peer-review evaluation structure. The current ERC leadership is comprised of Fotis Kafatos from the life sciences, who is the ScC Chair and ERC President, and Helga Nowotny from the social sciences/humanities and Daniel Estève from the physical/engineering sciences, who are the ScC Vice-Chairs/ERC Vice-Presidents. The second pillar of the ERC, the DIS, is responsible for supporting the peer-review process, implementing ERC strategy as set by the ScC, and executing all financial operations. The DIS is currently being transformed from a Directorate of the European Commission (EC) into an ERC Executive Agency (ERCEA), which will become fully operational in mid-2009. (Executive agencies are legal entities, established by the EC and entrusted with certain tasks relating to the management of one or more EC programs; http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/pri/en/oj/dat/2003/l_011/l_01120030116en00010008.pdf.) The development of the ERC has not been a simple matter (Heldin, 2008Heldin C.-H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 417-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, Winnacker, 2008Winnacker E.L. Eur. Educ. Res. J. 2008; 7: 124-130Crossref Google Scholar). To couple the two pillars and create an integrated institution, two mechanisms were put in place: (1) The post of Secretary General (currently held by Ernst-Ludwig Winnacker), selected by the ScC and located in Brussels, with the goal of interacting closely with the DIS (and in the future the ERCEA); (2) the Board consisting of the three ScC Chairs, the Director of DIS/ERCEA, and the Secretary General. There is also a five-member ERCEA Steering Committee, chaired by the EC's Director-General for Research (José Manuel Silva Rodríguez) and including a distinguished external scientist, a ScC member, and two senior EC officers. The ERC budget is guaranteed at €7.51 billion for 2007–2013, the duration of the EC's 7th Framework Programme. It provided €300 million in 2007 and will increase by ∼€250 million each year, reaching just under €1.8 billion for 2013. The ERC budget is supported by the EC and is supplemented by contributions from states associated with, but not currently members of, the EU (the so-called associated countries). Together, the 27 EU member states and the 12 associated countries comprise the European Research Area (ERA) (http://ec.europa.eu/research/era/index_en.html). (Here, we use ERA as a synonym for Europe.) The first founding principle of the ERC is that research grant applications should be judged using the sole criterion of peer-reviewed excellence, independent of political, geographic, or economic considerations (Winnacker, 2008Winnacker E.L. Eur. Educ. Res. J. 2008; 7: 124-130Crossref Google Scholar). All ERC calls for funding are open to nationals of any country in the world, as long as they are committed to work primarily in Europe. The second founding principle of the ERC is to target frontier research by encouraging high-risk, high-reward proposals that may revolutionize science and potentially lead to innovation if successful. The ScC does not pre-select the frontiers but challenges applicants to identify and pursue them. It then entrusts the evaluation panels to select the best, most promising proposals. The ERC asks researchers to think big and provides generous support for ambitious projects. It does not want its carefully selected grantees to waste their time by taking on numerous peripheral projects or constantly having to seek additional money to fund their research. The ERC has designed two core funding schemes, both aimed at individual principal investigators (PIs) of exceptional talent presenting highly promising proposals. The schemes differ in the degree of emphasis on the proposal, the PI's record, and academic age. The PIs apply in conjunction with a European host institution, but ERC grants are both flexible and portable. For example, the grantees can re-budget the granted funds and may decide to relocate elsewhere in Europe if dissatisfied with their initial host institution. The ERC Starting Grants (StG)—up to €2 million for 5 years—target highly promising applicants 3–8 years after completion of their doctorate, with allowance for time spent on parental leave and national service, who are establishing or consolidating their scientific independence. The ERC Advanced Grants (AdG)—up to €3.5 million for 5 years—target advanced independent PIs with significant research achievements in the last 10 years (publications in major scientific journals, patents, prizes, etc.) (http://erc.europa.eu/pdf/ERC_Guide_for_Applicants.pdf). StG grantees are required to spend the majority of their time on the ERC funded project, whereas AdG grantees must spend 30% of their total effort on the project and at least 50% of their time in Europe. For the purposes of peer review, the ERC divided the full range of scientific disciplines into three major domains, with budgets allotted to each based on the weighted average distribution of national funding in scientifically strong countries worldwide: 34% for life sciences, 14% for social sciences/humanities, and 39% for physical/engineering sciences. The ScC strongly encourages interdisciplinary proposals, for which a notional 13% of the budget is reserved, if sufficient top-quality proposals are submitted. Within each domain, the funds are allotted to panels based on their share of submitted proposals, with 25 panels for all three domains, each panel typically consisting of 12 eminent scientists. A single set of StG panels was created, along with two sets of AdG panels (enabling AdG panel members to apply for a grant on alternate years when they are not on the panel). There are ∼900 panelists, together with 1000 external referees, forming the backbone of the ERC evaluation structure."
https://openalex.org/W2056328380,"Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated (HCN) channels resemble Shaker K+ channels in structure and function. In both, changes in membrane voltage produce directionally similar movement of positively charged residues in the voltage sensor to alter the pore structure at the intracellular side and gate ion flow.

As in Shaker, HCN channels are comprised of four subunits, which each consist of six predicted membrane-spanning segments (S1–S6). The S1–S4 segments form the voltage-sensing domain, and the S5 and S6 segments, the pore-forming domain. The S4 segment in both channels contains positive charges that move similarly in response to changes in membrane voltage (4.Mannikko R. Elinder F. Larsson H.P.

Despite these similarities, HCN channels are opened by hyperpolarization of the membrane potential, whereas Shaker channels open in response to depolarization. Thus, the electromechanical coupling between the voltage sensor and the gate is reversed in these two channels. hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated cyclic nucleotide-binding domain picofarad. A key determinant of this coupling is the intrinsic stability of the closed and open conformations of the pore. In Shaker channels, it has been proposed that the pore is intrinsically most stable when closed and that the voltage sensor works to open the pore during depolarization (11.Yifrach O. MacKinnon R. Cell. 2002; 111: 231-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 12.Hackos D.H. Chang T.H. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Results from an alanine/valine scan of residues across the entire Shaker pore, by single point mutation, showed that most mutations made the channel easier to open and steepened the response of the channel to changes in voltage. It was argued that, because most mutations likely destabilize protein packing, the closed conformation must be the stable state; this is consistent with the observed crystal structures of Shaker-related channels KcsA and MthK, in the closed and open states, respectively, wherein more optimally and tightly packed helices were seen in the closed conformation (13.Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar, 14.Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M.

Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Because of presumed shared architecture of the gate between HCN and Shaker channels, HCN channels might also be most stable when closed, and thus the voltage sensor would work to open the pore upon hyperpolarization. To test this hypothesis, we performed an alanine/valine scan of the C-terminal 22 amino acids of the S6 segment in HCN2, used as a prototype, and examined pore energetics as described previously in Shaker (11.Yifrach O. MacKinnon R. Cell. 2002; 111: 231-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Choice of this region for mutation was based on: 1) in Shaker, the corresponding region harbors one of two clusters of gating-sensitive residues and 2) it contains the voltage-controlled gate. Surprisingly, the effects of the mutations on channel opening and on the steepness of the channel's response to voltage are mixed and smaller than those in Shaker. These findings imply that, in HCN2, the stabilities of the open and closed pore are similar, the interactions between the pore and voltage sensor, both structural and functional, are weaker than in Shaker, and that the voltage sensor must apply force to the pore to close it. Thus, Shaker is closed and HCN2 is open in the absence of input from the voltage sensor. Moreover, cAMP binding to the HCN2 channel heightens the effects of the mutations, indicating stronger interactions between the pore and voltage sensor, and tips the energetic balance toward a more stable open state. Single-point alanine/valine mutant HCN2 channels were constructed in one of two ways. First, some mutants were constructed by overlapping PCR mutagenesis using a mouse HCN2 template in pcDNA3.1, as previously described (14.Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). For remaining mutants, bp 1172–2216 of the mouse HCN2 template were amplified by PCR primers containing distal EcoRI and BamHI sites and subcloned into pBluescript. QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was then used to generate mutations in this amplified fragment. Next, BlpI- and AgeI-digested fragments were inserted into the mouse HCN2 template. All mutations were confirmed via DNA sequencing (Nucleic Acid Protein Service Unit facility, University of British Columbia). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Ham's F-12 media supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were plated onto glass coverslips. Two days after splitting, mammalian expression vectors encoding wild-type or mutant HCN2 channels (2 μg per 35-mm dish), and a green fluorescent protein reporter plasmid (0.3 μg per dish), were transiently cotransfected into the cells using the FuGene6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells expressing green fluorescent protein were chosen for whole cell patch clamp recordings 24–48 h post transfection. The pipette solution contained (in mm): 130 potassium Asp, 10 NaCl, 0.5 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, and 5 HEPES with pH adjusted to 7.4 using KOH. For experiments at saturating levels of cAMP, 2 mm cAMP (sodium salt) was added to the pipette solution. Extracellular recording solution contained (in mm): 135 KCl, 5 NaCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES with pH adjusted to 7.4 using KOH. Whole cell currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and Clampex software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) at room temperature. Patch clamp pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and fire-polished before use (pipette R = 2.5–4.5 MΩ). Data were filtered at 2-kHz and were analyzed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments), Origin (MicroCal, Northampton, MA), and Excel (Microsoft, Seattle, WA) software. If activation curves were determined from tail currents at a 2-s pulse to −35 mV following 3- to 15-s test pulses ranging from −150 to −10 mV, in 20-mV steps. Single tail current test pulses were followed by a 500-ms pulse to +5 mV to ensure complete channel deactivation. The resting current was allowed to return to its baseline value before subsequent voltage pulses. If activation curves were determined by plotting normalized tail current amplitudes versus test voltage and fitting these with a single order Boltzmann function, fV=Imax/1+ev1/2−V/k(Eq. 1) to determine the midpoint of activation (V½) and slope factor (k). The effective charge (Z) was calculated using the equation Z = RT/kF, where T = 295 K and R and F have their usual thermodynamic meanings. Changes in free energy between open and closed states were given by −ZFV½. The perturbation in free energy produced by introduction of the point mutations (Δ(ZFV½)) was given by −F(ZmutV½mut − ZwtV½wt). The standard errors for Δ(ZFV½) were calculated using αΔ(ZFV1/2) = (α2ZFV1/2, wt + α2ZFV1/2, mut)1/2. Differences in values for V½, Z, and ZFV½ between the wild-type channel and mutant channels were determined independently using an unpaired t test (p < 0.05 was considered significant). Each sample was derived from cells on 35-mm plates that had been lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris at pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm each of Na3VO4 and NaF, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin. Samples were left on ice for 30 min, during which time they were vortexed every 5 min for ∼5 s. After centrifugation to remove cell debris (25,000 × g, 25 min), protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by Bradford assay. 20-μg samples of supernatant were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (8%) and electroblotted to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Blots were washed three times in TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were then incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to the C terminus of HCN2 (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), at a dilution of 1:500 in TBST with 5% nonfat dry milk for 2.5 h at room temperature. Blots were washed in TBST for 10 min, three times, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated to goat anti-rabbit 1:3000 dilution in 5% nonfat dry milk with TBST for 1 h at room temperature; they were subsequently washed three times in TBST. Signals were obtained with ECL Western blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Protein loading was controlled by probing all Western blots with goat anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). To determine the most stable conformation of the channel, we performed a single-point alanine/valine scan of the C-terminal 22 amino acids of the S6 segment in HCN2 (Ile422–Asp443) and examined channel opening, as described previously in Shaker (11.Yifrach O. MacKinnon R. Cell. 2002; 111: 231-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that, as for Shaker channels, the values for V½ would be shifted in the positive direction and Z would be larger, due to disruption of a more stable closed state by introduced alanine or valine residues. This assumes that the closed conformation of the channel is at an energetic minimum and that all of the mutations within the S6 will result in positive perturbation energies. The S6 sites involved in positive perturbations promote a more stable closed conformation, whereas those that produce negative perturbations promote a more stable open conformation. The relative numbers that shift in the two directions give an approximation of the relative stability of the open versus the closed conformations, e.g. a larger number of negative perturbation energies would suggest a more stable open state, an equal number of positive and negative perturbation energies would suggest that the stabilities of the open and closed conformations are about equal. Finally, this assumes that each residue contributes equally to stability. Wild-type and mutant channels were expressed independently in CHO cells from which If was recorded using the whole cell patch clamp approach. If activation curves were determined by plotting normalized tail current amplitudes versus test voltage and fitting these with Equation 1 (Experimental Procedures). From this fit, values for V½ and Z were determined to thereby allow calculation of perturbation energies (Table 1, A and B). Gating parameters and perturbation energies of wild-type channels were compared with those of the mutant channels using an unpaired t test. 18 of 22 single-point mutations expressed measurable levels of If from which activation curves could be derived (Fig. 1, A and B). Levels of If for G424A, A425V, T426A, and Y428A were not detectable. Unexpectedly, more mutants had a V½ value that were either significantly more negative (5/18) or unchanged (10/18) from that of wild type, than those which were more positive (3/18) (Fig. 1C, upper). With one exception, all Z values of mutants were unchanged from that of wild type (Fig. 1C, lower). Finally, with the exception of three values, the free energies of mutants were unchanged from that of wild type (Fig. 1D). The mix of positive and negative shifts in V½ and lack of change in free energies in the mutant channels suggest that, contrary to our hypothesis, the stabilities of the open and closed conformations are similar. These data are in accordance with recent findings from an alanine/valine scan of S6 in HCN2 expressed in Xenopus oocytes, which showed that most mutations shifted the opening of the channel to more negative potentials or had no effect; however, the energetic repercussions of these changes on gating were not explored (16.Cheng L. Kinard K. Rajamani R. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 322: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).TABLE 1The effects of S6 pore mutations on voltage-de pend ent gating at basal (A) and saturating (2 mm; B) levels of cAMPFIGURE 1Alanine scanning of the HCN2 S6 segment minimally perturbs the energetics of channel opening.

Inhibition by the CNBD occurs by a coupled interaction with the C-linker, a structure that connects the CNBD to the S6 helices, which is thought to apply a force on these helices to inhibit pore opening (20.Craven K.B. Zagotta W.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 23.Zhou L. Siegelbaum S.A. Structure. 2007; 15: 655-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). cAMP binding reverses the coupled interaction, which then alleviates inhibition of pore opening thereby promoting a more stable open state. Given a more stable open conformation upon cAMP binding, we hypothesized that, in saturating levels of this cyclic nucleotide, the S6 mutations would produce more dramatic effects on V½ and Z and a shift in perturbation energies toward more negative values. To test this hypothesis, identical experiments were conducted with all 22 mutant channels and the wild-type channel at saturating levels of cAMP (2 mm). All but one mutant (G424A) expressed measurable levels of If from which activation curves could be determined (Fig. 2, A and B). For the wild-type HCN2 channel, V½ was shifted +10.1 mV, and Z was decreased 0.4 compared with the values determined at basal cAMP (Table 1, A and B). The majority of V½ values in the mutant channels were more negative (6/21) or unchanged (9/21) compared with wild-type, whereas fewer values were more positive (6/21) (Fig. 2C, upper). The majority of Z values were larger (6/21) or unchanged (14/21) compared with wild type, whereas only one value was smaller (Fig. 2C, lower). A majority of free energies were more negative (9/21) or unchanged (11/21) compared with wild type, but only one value was more positive (Fig. 2D). Comparing free energies in saturating cAMP with those in basal cAMP (Figs. 1D and 2D), there was a lower proportion of more positive free energies (1/21 versus 2/18), a lower proportion of unchanged free energies (11/21 versus 15/18), and a higher proportion more negative free energies (9/21 versus 1/18). For one site (G433A), free energy was significantly positive in basal cAMP but, in saturating concentrations of cAMP, it was not altered significantly. The shift of perturbation energies toward the negative, when assayed at saturating levels of cAMP, suggest that the open conformation becomes more stable as a result of cAMP binding. Three of the mutants that were not functional in basal cAMP recovered function in saturating levels cAMP (A425V, T426A, and Y428A), which may have been due to one or both of the following reasons. First, in basal cAMP levels, the mutations may have shifted the range of current activation to very negative voltages at which function cannot be reliably ascertained (i.e. more negative than −150 mV). In elevated cAMP, the activation range would have moved to less negative voltages where the likelihood of detecting channel activity is increased using our protocols. Second, the number of functional channels at the cell surface or single channel conductance may have been reduced by the mutations. For HCN2 channels, cAMP has been suggested to increase open probability in addition to shifting the activation curve to more positive voltages (20.Craven K.B. Zagotta W.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which could have overcome reductions in number of functional channels or single channel conductance. A reduction in the number of functional channels or single channel conductance by these three mutations is supported by the significantly lower levels of current they produce compared with the wild-type channel (wt HCN2, −421 ± 98 pA/picofarad (pF), n = 8; A425V, −71 ± 8 pA/pF, n = 3; T426A, −116 ± 22 pA/pF, n = 4; Y428A, −100 ± 16 pA/pF, n = 5; all of the mutants are significantly different from wild-type HCN2, p < 0.05). The G424A mutant did not yield current in either basal or elevated cAMP. A lack of function has also been reported for the identical mutant when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (16.Cheng L. Kinard K. Rajamani R. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 322: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Western blotting showed that this mutant did not undergo complex glycosylation, unlike the wild-type channel but like a channel in which the N-glycosylation site has been mutated (N380Q) (Fig. 3). These data suggest that G424 is important for plasma membrane localization of functional channels. In Shaker, an alanine/valine scan of the pore showed that Z values increased as V½ values became more negative (11.Yifrach O. MacKinnon R. Cell. 2002; 111: 231-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This relationship is consistent with effects on the final closed to open step in a linear gating scheme in which each of the four voltage sensors moves independently, and, once all sensors reach the permissive state, the pore opens by a voltage-independent concerted transition (24.Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 321-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 25.Schoppa N.E. Sigworth F.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 313-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). For HCN2, we were struck by the mutation-induced changes in Z, because they were very small compared with those in Shaker. To determine whether the comparatively small changes in Z are still consistent with an altered closed to open step in HCN2, we applied an allosteric model that captures most aspects of HCN channel gating behavior (26.Altomare C. Bucchi A. Camatini E. Baruscotti M. Viscomi C. Moroni A. DiFrancesco D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (Scheme 1). In this model, the voltage sensor in each of the four monomeric subunits moves from reluctant to willing states (C to C4) independently to then allosterically trigger closed to open transitions. Successive engagement of each subunit enhances the probability of channel opening (Po) given by Po=11+LV1+1/KV1+1/aKV4(Eq. 2) where K(V) and L(V) are the equilibrium constants for voltage-sensor movement and the closed to open step, respectively. One important way in which this model differs from the scheme used to describe Shaker is that the closed to open step is dependent upon voltage. Using this model, Altomare et al. (26.Altomare C. Bucchi A. Camatini E. Baruscotti M. Viscomi C. Moroni A. DiFrancesco D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) showed that HCN-mediated currents were well fitted and that isoform-specific positions of the activation curves and delays in both current activation and deactivation could be predicted. We used this allosteric model to generate hypothetical values of Z and V½ by varying the rate of either the closed to open step (L(V)) or voltage-sensor movement (K(V)) to assess which change could best predict the effects of the S6 mutations on Z. Because the HCN2 S6 mutations are in a region of the pore that contains the gate, an effect on the closed to open transition, and thus on L(V), would be expected. Z values derived from model Po curves by varying L(V), but not by varying K(V), should then approximate our experimental Z values. To test this, Po curves were generated using Equation 2 with a range of L(V) and K(V) values and model parameters specific for either basal or 2 mm cAMP. Model parameters were determined by best fitting and are shown in Table 2. Select Po curves that spanned a similar range of voltages as those determined experimentally were then fitted with Equation 1 to yield theoretical values for Z and V½, which were then plotted in Fig. 4(A and B). Both the Z values obtained by varying L(V) and those observed experimentally do not vary greatly with V½; this held true at basal and at saturating levels of cAMP (in Fig. 4, compare the experimentally determined Z values with those determined from the model using a range of L(V) values, represented by the individual symbols and black lines, respectively). In contrast, the Z values obtained by varying K(V) in the model increase at more negative voltages and plateau in the range of voltages separate from that in which most of the experimentally determined Z values are found, in both basal and saturating levels of cAMP (in Fig. 4, compare the experimentally determined Z values with those determined from the model using a range of K(V) values, represented by the individual symbols and gray lines, respectively). Furthermore, when K(V) was decreased in the model, the activation curves reached a point at which Z and V½ values changed very little, even with very small values for K(V). Consequently, there are no model Z values at voltages less negative than ∼−95 mV in Fig. 4 (note that the gray lines do not continue to less negative voltages in this figure). These data are consistent with an impact of the S6 mutations primarily on L(V) and thus on the closed to open transition.TABLE 2Allosteric model parameters at basal and saturating (2 mm) levels of cAMPFIGURE 4Experimental and model Z values are comparable and change minimally over the range of observed mid-activation voltages.

Also shown are individual values for Z and V½ obtained experimentally for wild-type (filled black diamonds), mutants that are significantly different from wild-type (filled red or blue diamonds, which are smaller or larger than wild-type, respectively) and mutants that are not significantly different from wild-type (open squares).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) However, some Z values were affected significantly by the mutations, especially when cAMP was elevated (note the colored points in Fig. 4). This is not predicted by the model when varying either L(V) or K(V), suggesting that combined effects of the mutations on both voltage-sensor movement and the closed to open step, and/or on other transitions prior"

https://openalex.org/W2014313235,"Chromatin condensation to heterochromatin is a mechanism essential for widespread suppression of gene transcription, and the means by which a chromatin-associated protein, MENT, induces a terminally differentiated state in cells. MENT, a protease inhibitor of the serpin superfamily, is able to undergo conformational change in order to effect enzyme inhibition. Here, we sought to investigate whether conformational change in MENT is 'fine-tuned' in the presence of a bound ligand in an analogous manner to other serpins, such as antithrombin where such movements are reflected by a change in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Using this technique, MENT was found to undergo structural shifts in the presence of DNA packaged into nucleosomes, but not naked DNA. The contribution of the four Trp residues of MENT to the fluorescence change was mapped using deconvolution analysis of variants containing single Trp to Phe mutations. The analysis indicated that the overall emission spectra is dominated by a helix-H tryptophan, but this residue did not dominate the conformational change in the presence of chromatin, suggesting that other Trp residues contained in the A-sheet and RCL regions contribute to the conformational change. Mutagenesis revealed that the conformational change requires the presence of the DNA-binding 'M-loop' and D-helix of MENT, but is independent of the protease specificity determining 'reactive centre loop'. The D-helix mutant of MENT, which is unable to condense chromatin, does not undergo a conformational change, despite being able to bind chromatin, indicating that the conformational change may contribute to chromatin condensation by the serpin."
