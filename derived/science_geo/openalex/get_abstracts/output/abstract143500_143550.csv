Ras-mediated activation of extracellular-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase has been implicated in cyclin D1 up-regulation, but there is little extracellular-regulated kinase activity during the later stages of G1, when cyclin D1 expression becomes maximal, implying that other effector pathways may also be important in cyclin D1 induction. We have addressed the involvement of Ras effectors from the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and Ral-GDS families in G1 progression and compared it to that of the Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. PI 3-kinase activity is required for the expression of endogenous cyclin D1 and for S phase entry following serum stimulation of quiescent NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Activated PI 3-kinase induces cyclin D1 transcription and E2F activity, at least in part mediated by the serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB, and to a lesser extent the Rho family GTPase Rac. In addition, both activated Ral-GDS-like factor and Raf stimulate cyclin D1transcription and E2F activity and act in synergy with PI 3-kinase. Therefore, multiple cooperating pathways mediate the effects of Ras on progression through the cell cycle.

Therefore, multiple cooperating pathways mediate the effects of Ras on progression through the cell cycle. Upon reentry of cells into the cell cycle and throughout the G1 phase, mitogenic signals are integrated through the GTPase Ras. Inhibition of Ras function by microinjection of Ras-neutralizing antibodies or by inducible expression of dominant negative Ras arrests cycling cells in G1 and prevents growth factor stimulated cells from leaving G0 to reenter the cell cycle (1Cai H.

The requirement of Ras function during the G0/G1 transition seems to be conserved from yeast, in which it is necessary for spore germination (5Herman P.K. Rine J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6171-6181Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Microinjection of anti-Ras antibodies has demonstrated a requirement for Ras up to 2 h prior to S phase entry (6Dobrowolski S.

Overexpression of mutationally activated Ras leads to cellular transformation and a shortening of the G1 phase of the cell cycle (8Liu J.J. Chao J.R. Jiang M.C. Ng S.Y. Yen J.J. Yang-Yen H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3654-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, transformation of cells by activated Ras requires other genetic changes, as only immortal cells that have lost cell cycle checkpoints, such as those imposed by cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 1The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular-regulated kinase; MEK, MAP/ERK kinase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PIP3, PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate; Rb, retinoblastoma; Rlf, Ral-GDS-like factor; Ral-GDS, Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator; PKB, protein kinase B; TOR, target of rapamycin.1The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular-regulated kinase; MEK, MAP/ERK kinase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PIP3, PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate; Rb, retinoblastoma; Rlf, Ral-GDS-like factor; Ral-GDS, Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator; PKB, protein kinase B; TOR, target of rapamycin. inhibitors, retinoblastoma protein, and p53, can be transformed by Ras alone. The expression of activated Ras in primary cells leads to cell cycle arrest via up-regulation of cdk inhibitors and p53. The resulting phenotype resembles that of cellular senescence (9Serrano M.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), the Ras effector Raf appears to be sufficient to mediate this effect via induction of p21Waf1/Cip1. Thus, Ras exerts both positive and negative effects on cell growth, depending on cellular context. Recent work from this and other laboratories has shown that Ras is able to interact with multiple effector enzymes, including the Raf protein kinases, the Ral-GDS family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Ral, and type I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (13Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The functions of multiple Ras effectors are required for cellular transformation; in addition to Raf, both the PI 3-kinase and the Ral-GDS pathways cooperate to achieve efficient transformation of immortalized cells (14White M.A. Nicolette C.

Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Therefore, several Ras effector pathways may interface with the cell cycle machinery. Ras has been implicated in the positive regulation of the cyclin D1 promoter. The conditional expression of oncogenic Ras induces cyclin D1 protein production in growth factor-deprived cells (16Filmus J. Robles A.I. Shi W. Wong M.J. Colombo L.L. Conti C.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3627-3633PubMed Google Scholar). However, the resulting cyclin D1/cdk4 complexes may remain inactive in the absence of growth factors (17Winston J.T. Coats S.R. Wang Y.Z. Pledger W.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 127-134PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of Raf-ER, a conditionally active fusion of Raf to the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor, and conditional expression of an activated form of the MAP/ERK kinase, MEK, reproduce the effect of oncogenic Ras on cyclin D1, and under certain conditions this signal can be blocked by co-expression of a MAP kinase phosphatase or dominant-interfering mutants of ERK. Therefore, these Ras effects have been attributed to the sequential activation of Raf kinase, MEK, and ERK (18Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Müller R. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar, 19Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32966-32971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, there are circumstances under which ERK activity may be dispensable for cyclin D1 production as the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 does not inhibit serum-induced cyclin D1expression in IIC9 fibroblasts (21Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that low levels of Raf kinase activity promote proliferation by inducing cyclin D1 and strong Raf activity inhibits cell cycle progression through production of cdk inhibitors (9Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3861) Google Scholar, 10Sewing A. Wiseman B. Lloyd A.C. Land H. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, it is also possible that the divergent effects of Ras on proliferation are mediated by distinct effector proteins, which could be subject to independent regulation by cross-talk with other signaling pathways. Therefore, we investigated which of the known Ras effectors would interface with the G1 cell cycle machinery. We find that activation of PI 3-kinase is required for cyclin D1 protein expression and S phase entry in fibroblasts. The PI 3-kinase pathway also contributes to the activation of E2F-dependent transcription underlining its importance for progression through G1. An activated form of Ral-GDS-like factor (Rlf), which has recently been implicated in the transcriptional induction of the c-fos proto-oncogene, also strongly activated cyclin D1 transcription. Thus, multiple pathways in addition to Raf/MAP kinase mediate the effects of Ras on cyclin D1 expression and E2F transcriptional activity in order to drive G1 progression.

Raf CAAX DD is an activated form of c-Raf-1 in which Raf is localized to the membrane by a farnesylation sequence from H-Ras and also by mutation of two tyrosine residues, 340 and 341, to aspartic acids; it was kindly provided by Raichard Marais and Chris Marshall. NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in 10% calf serum and starved for 48 h in 0.15% calf serum where indicated. LY294002 was used at 20 μm unless indicated otherwise. The final concentration of PD 98059 (Biomol) was 30 μm, and rapamycin was used at 50 nm. Cells were preincubated with inhibitors for 10 min prior to addition of calf serum to 10%. LipofectAMINE was used to transfect 1.5 105cells with 0.5 μg of each plasmid. Cells were lysed 36 h after transfection. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and luciferase activity was measured using Promega luciferin as substrate. The results were corrected using CH110-expressed (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) β-galactosidase activity. Figs. 5 and 6 show the means of four to seven experiments, and error bars represent S.E. The expression of all constructs were confirmed by immunoblotting: in the data presented in Figs. 5 and 6, any given construct was expressed at similar levels in different assay points in the same experiment.Figure 6E2F transcriptional activity is elevated by Ras signaling pathways. Regulation of E2F activity was analyzed by transfection of a reporter containing the adenovirus E2 promoter E2F binding site along with various Ras effectors into NIH 3T3 cells. Reporter activity was analyzed 24–36 h after transfection. Data are expressed as the fold induction of luciferase activity relative to the amount in cells that have been transfected only with the reporter construct under identical conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to determine cell cycle distribution, NIH 3T3 cells were trypsinized washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 70% ethanol at 4 °C while vortexing and stored at −20 °C. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 100 μg/ml ribonuclease for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) and analyzed by flow cytometry using 488 nm excitation. The cyclin D1 polyclonal antiserum was a gift from G. Peters. An anti-RB monoclonal antibody was used for immunoprecipitation (Pharmingen), and Rb was detected using a polyclonal serum (Santa Cruz). Anti-phospho-ERK was purchased from Promega. Ras was detected using anti-pan Ras antibody-4 (Calbiochem). GST-Raf-Ras binding domain (56Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21, and bacteria were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.2 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm benzamidine. The suspension was aliquoted, snap-frozen, and stored at −70 °C. Prior to use, aliquots were thawed and sonicated. The fusion protein was then purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. NIH 3T3 cells were lysed in the same lysis buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2 but lacking glycerol. The cleared lysates were incubated with beads in lysis buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2 for 20 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed once in cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 0.1% Triton X-100. Bound Ras was quantified by Western blotting. Akt/PKB kinase was immunoprecipitated from NIH 3T3 cell lysates, and immune complex kinase assays were performed using histone H2B as a substrate as described previously (25Marte B.M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennström S. Warne P.H. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ras function has been shown to be required throughout G1 up to the restriction point, after which cells become committed to enter S phase. In order to determine Ras activity at later stages in G1, we made use of the high affinity interaction of the active GTPase with the Ras binding domain of Raf kinase (22Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Quiescent NIH 3T3 cells were stimulated with serum, and GTP-bound Ras was purified based on its ability to bind to recombinant fusion protein containing the Ras binding domain of Raf. Ras activation was found to be biphasic with a strong second mid-G1 peak of activity that was maximal at about 2–4 h after exit from quiescence (Fig. 1A). Whereas the first peak of Ras activity up to about 30 min after stimulation correlated with ERK phosphorylation, little ERK activity could be detected at 4 h (Fig. 1B) (see also Ref. 22Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). This is likely to be due to the induction of MAP kinase phosphatases as a result of the early phase of growth factor receptor and Ras activation (23Frost J.A. Xu S. Hutchison M.R. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3707-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). One of the functions in cell cycle progression attributed to Ras in cells released from quiescence is the induction of cyclin D1 protein as a consequence of ERK activation. However, cyclin D1 expression became detectable only at 4 h after stimulation and became maximal at 6–8 h (see Fig. 3,A and B), consistent with previous reports (24de Vries-Smits A.M. Pronk G.J. Medema J.P. Burgering B.M. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 919-925PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, cyclin D1 induction correlates with the second phase of Ras activity, which is not associated with ERK activation. The serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB is activated by phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which is generated upon activation of the Ras effector PI 3-kinase. In order to determine whether the time course of Akt/PKB activation is consistent with a role in G1 progression, its kinase activity was determined at various times during the G1 phase. As shown in Fig. 1C, Akt/PKB activity was sustained during G1, and its period of activity encompassed the second peak of Ras activation. In order to determine which Ras effector pathways are required for G1 progression, we made use of chemical inhibitors for MEK (PD 98059) and PI 3-kinase (LY 294002). Because it is known that LY 294002 also inhibits some relatives of PI 3-kinase, such as TOR, the specific TOR inhibitor rapamycin was also used. Quiescent NIH 3T3 cells were preincubated with inhibitor and then stimulated with serum in the presence of inhibitor. Fig. 2A shows the cell cycle distribution at 14 and 20 h after serum treatment. Whereas both PD 98059 and rapamycin caused delays in S phase entry, many cells treated with either inhibitor were able to initiate DNA synthesis by 14 h. However, in the presence of LY 294002, cells had not progressed into S phase at all after 14 h. At 20 h, more than 75% of the LY 294002-treated cells were still in G0/1, compared with well under for 50% for control cells and those treated with PD 98059 or rapamycin. In order to determine the effectiveness of the drug treatments, cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-phospho-Akt or anti-phospho-ERK antibodies. Levels of the activity of these downstream effectors of PI 3-kinase and Raf were less than 5% of untreated serum controls for Akt in the presence of 20 μm LY294002 or 15% for ERK in the presence of 30 μm PD98059 at all time points (data not shown). Fig. 2B shows the effect of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor on unsynchronized cells. The presence of LY 294002 for 48 h induced a level of arrest similar to that observed in growth factor deprived cells. The half-maximal inhibition of G1 progression was achieved at 4 μm LY 294002, which is similar to the IC50 for inhibition of insulin stimulated Akt/PKB activity (Fig. 2C) (25Marte B.M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennström S. Warne P.H. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that PI 3-kinase activity is essential for the progression of cells through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. One of the earliest effects of serum stimulation leading to cell cycle reentry in fibroblasts is the expression of cyclin D1 protein. In order to determine the effects of the various inhibitors on cyclin D1 expression, NIH 3T3 cells were treated with inhibitors as above, and the expression of cyclin D1 was analyzed. Fig. 3A shows that the presence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002 severely inhibited cyclin D1 expression at all time points studied. The presence of the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 led to a slightly reduced expression of cyclin D1 relative to uninhibited cells at 7 h, but there was no effect at later time points. The TOR inhibitor rapamycin caused some decrease in cyclin D1 expression at 7 and 14 h, but by 20 h, this effect was negligible. At all times, rapamycin was less inhibitory for cyclin D1 expression than was LY 294002, suggesting that the effects of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor were not connected with inhibition of the target of rapamycin. The PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002 thus inhibits one of the earliest events in G1. In order to determine the length of time in G1 during which PI 3-kinase activity is required for cyclin D1 expression, the inhibitor was added at different times after release of cells from starvation by serum treatment. Fig. 3B shows that about 8 h after serum treatment, cyclin D1 expression becomes independent of PI 3-kinase activity but that inhibition of PI 3-kinase at any time during the first 6 h of serum treatment results in inhibition of cyclin D1 expression. Inhibition of MEK through the use of PD98059 has only a small effect on cyclin D1 expression, which is lost if inhibitor treatment is delayed until 4 h after serum addition, suggesting that the low levels of ERK activity in late G1 are not important for cyclin D1 expression. Fig. 3C shows that the concentration of rapamycin used in this experiment was sufficient to inhibit phosphorylation of p70S6K, the downstream target of TOR activity. The presence of LY 294002 did not lead to detectable p70S6K inhibition, reflecting the fact that although PI 3-kinase contributes to the regulation of p70S6K, there are multiple pathways involved including some utilizing protein kinase C that are not sensitive to inhibition of PI 3-kinase. Therefore, p70S6K does not seem to be required for S phase entry in fibroblasts, in agreement with previous observations (26Yao R. Cooper G.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 343-351PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of drug treatments on earlier time points after serum stimulation were also studied (Fig. 3D). In agreement with the data shown in Fig. 3A,LY 294002 caused a profound delay in induction of cyclin D1, whereas PD 98059 causes only a slight delay. The Akt/PKB kinase is believed to be activated by PI 3-kinase generated PIP3 through a sequential mechanism. The binding of the lipid to its PH domain recruits the enzyme to the plasma membrane, where it is phosphorylated at Thr-308 and Ser-473. A kinase, termed PDK1, that can phosphorylate Thr-308 only when Akt/PKB is bound to PIP3 has been purified and cloned. PDK1 is itself dependent on PIP3 for its activity (27Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P. Reece C. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). The identity of the Ser-473 kinase is not known at present. Thus, PIP3 is required for at least two steps in the Akt/PKB activation mechanism, the first of which can be overcome by constitutively targeting the kinase to the membrane, as is observed in its viral counterpart v-Akt, in which the viral gag sequence is myristylated. Constitutively membrane-localized Akt/PKB is thus partially, but not completely, resistant to the effects of PI 3-kinase inhibitors. Several stable cell lines expressing gag-Akt/PKB were generated and pooled to investigate the regulation of cyclin D1expression in the presence of enhanced Akt/PKB activity. Fig. 4A demonstrates that gag-Akt/PKB expression results in a partial rescue of cyclin D1 expression in the presence of LY 294002 (compare with Fig. 3A). At 7 h of serum treatment, LY 294002 did reduce cyclin D1 expression, but the effect was much less marked at 14 h, and by 20 h the amount of cyclin D1 was not much different to that in uninhibited cells. Intriguingly, the gag-Akt/PKB transfected cells expressed low levels of cyclin D1 in the absence of growth factors. Therefore, we determined the levels of cyclin D1 expression in individual clones expressing gag-Akt/PKB. All cell lines showed cyclin D1 expression in the absence of growth factors, albeit at lower levels than serum-starved V12 Ras-expressing cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, Akt/PKB activity may mediate some, but not all, of the effects of V12 Ras on cyclin D1 expression. Previous work on the regulation of cyclin D1 transcription has shown that the promoter is growth factor-regulated and can be activated by oncogenic mutants of Ras (16Filmus J. Robles A.I. Shi W. Wong M.J. Colombo L.L. Conti C.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3627-3633PubMed Google Scholar,17Winston J.T. Coats S.R. Wang Y.Z. Pledger W.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 127-134PubMed Google Scholar, 29Herber B. Truss M. Beato M. Muller R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1295-1304PubMed Google Scholar). As we were unable to detect any differences in cyclin D1 protein stability in the presence of LY 294002 or upon expression of activated Akt/PKB (data not shown), we investigated the regulation of cyclin D1 transcription in response to the expression of various Ras effectors. We used a reporter construct encompassing 1.8 kilobases proximal to the transcriptional start site of human cyclin D1. As shown in Fig. 5A, V12 Ras induced transcription from the reporter 4-fold. Various dominant negative alleles of Ras effectors were used to determine their contribution to this effect. Dominant negative mutants of Ral (N28 Ral) and Akt/PKB (PKB-CAAX, dn Akt) both strongly reduced activated Ras induction of the cyclin D1 reporter. Although activated Rac (V12 Rac), a putative PI 3-kinase target, was also able to activate the cyclin D1 reporter construct as described previously (30Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell.

The level of V12 Ras expression was checked and found not to vary when cells were co-transfected with dominant negative effectors. In addition, as a control, c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity was checked in transfections done in parallel to Fig. 5A: N17 Rac caused 70% inhibition of the activity of epitope tagged c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 co-expressed with V12 Ras. This compares well with the level of inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity by N17 Rac reported by others, indicating that the dominant negative Rac was effective on other pathways. Activated forms of the various effectors of Ras were used to determine their effects on cyclin D1 transcription. On their own, activated PI 3-kinase as well as gag-Akt/PKB both gave signals of comparable strength to that observed upon expression of an activated form of Raf kinase (Fig. 5). Because the different Ras effectors activate distinct downstream signaling cascades, we investigated whether they would cooperate to activate cyclin D1transcription. Another distinct Ras effector, Rlf, was also included in this analysis. Whereas expression of activated forms of Raf, Rlf, and PI 3-kinase on their own gave 2.5–3-fold inductions, the combined effect of Raf and Rlf was additive (Fig. 5B). Combined expression of PI 3-kinase and Raf as well as PI 3-kinase and Rlf synergized in cyclin D1 induction, suggesting that they use independent pathways to activate D1 transcription. Because the presence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002 delayed cyclin D1 expression (Fig. 3) and Rb hyperphosphorylation (data not shown) we reasoned that the PI 3-kinase activity may be required for the release of E2F activity from Rb-mediated repression. Therefore, we used an E2F reporter derived from the adenovirus E2 promoter to assess E2F transcriptional activity (31Murthy S.C. Bhat G.P. Thimmappaya B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2230-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows that the V12 Ras-induced increase of E2F activity can be partially suppressed by co-expression of dominant-negative constructs that block the function of the Ras effectors Ral-GDS (N28 Ral) and PI 3-kinase (Δp85). Co-expressing a dominant-interfering construct of Akt/PKB also reduced V12 Ras-dependent induction o"

Inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, simvastatin (Sim, 1–10 μm), inhibited PDGF-induced SMC DNA synthesis by >95%, retinoblastoma gene product hyperphosphorylation by 90%, and cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk)-2, -4, and -6 activity by 80 ± 5, 50 ± 3, and 48 ± 3%, respectively. This correlated with a 20-fold increase in p27 Kip1 without changes in p16, p21 Waf1, or p53 levels compared with PDGF alone. Since Ras and Rho require isoprenoid modification for membrane localization and are implicated in cell cycle regulation, we investigated the effects of Sim on Ras and Rho. Up-regulation of p27 Kip1 and inhibition of Rho but not Ras membrane translocation by Sim were reversed by geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, but not farnesylpyrophosphate. Indeed, inhibition of Rho by Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase or overexpression of dominant-negative N19RhoA mutant increased p27 Kip1 and inhibited retinoblastoma hyperphosphorylation. In contrast, activation of Rho byEscherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 decreased p27 Kip1 and increased SMC DNA synthesis. These findings indicate that the down-regulation of p27 Kip1 by Rho GTPase mediates PDGF-induced SMC DNA synthesis and suggest a novel direct effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors on the vascular wall.

The entry and progression of SMC into the cell cycle is stimulated by growth factors derived from inflammatory cells, platelets, and the vascular wall (2Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4976) Google Scholar). Although these growth factors which include basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor-β1, angiotensin II, and insulin-like growth factor utilize distinct signaling pathways to promote SMC DNA synthesis, these signaling pathways, however, must converge upon common regulators of the cell cycle (3Lukas J. Bartkove J. Bartek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6917-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). These regulators include the cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), and Cdk inhibitors. Indeed, gene therapy with Cdk inhibitors or treatment with a neutralizing antibody to PDGF inhibits neointimal smooth muscle DNA synthesis after balloon angioplasty (1Braun-Dullaeus R.C. Mann M.J.

Science. 1991; 253: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). The transition through the cell cycle is regulated by the expression and activity of cell cycle checkpoint proteins comprising of cyclins and Cdks (5Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4312) Google Scholar). These in turn are regulated by the family of Cdk inhibitor proteins, such as p16, p21 Waf1 and p27 Kip1. The final common pathway leading to G0/G1/S transition is the hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product (Rb), which functions as a molecular switch dedicating the cell to DNA replication. Hyperphosphorylation of Rb results in the release of the transcription factor E2F, which induces the expression of genes required for the progression through S, G2, and M phases (5Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4312) Google Scholar). Despite recent advances in the understanding of cell cycle regulation in proliferative vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and post-angioplasty restenosis, therapy is still lacking which can effectively prevent SMC DNA synthesis. Large clinical trials have shown that inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors or statins improve clinical outcomes in patients with atherosclerosis. For example, treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors reduces post-angioplasty re-stenosis, coronary bypass occlusions (6Shepherd J. Cobbe S.M. Ford I. Isles C.G. Lorimer A.R. MacFarlane P.W.

Atherosclerosis. 1993; 101: 117-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), the mechanism(s) by which they inhibit cell growth is not known. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors not only inhibit cholesterol synthesis, but also, inhibit the synthesis of important isoprenoid intermediates such as farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP). Both FPP and GGPP are important lipid attachments for the post-translational modification of a variety of proteins, including Ras and Rho GTP-binding proteins (10Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

The purpose of this study, therefore, is to determine the role and mechanism of isoprenoid intermediates in regulating cell cycle progression in human vascular SMC. All standard culture reagents were obtained from JRH Bioscience (Lenexa, KS). Mevastatin (compactin), farnesylpyrophosphate, geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, and l-mevalonate were purchased from Sigma. Low density lipoprotein, FTI-276, and GGTI-286 were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Simvastatin was obtained from Merck Sharp and Dohme, Inc. Mevastatin and simvastatin were chemically activated by alkaline hydrolysis prior to use as described previously (13Laufs U. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24266-24271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). PDGF-BB was purchased from Genzyme (Boston, MA). [α-32P]ATP, [3H]thymidine, [3H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, and [3H]farnesylpyrophosphate were supplied by NEN Life Science Products Inc. The antibody detection kit (enhanced chemiluminescence) and the nylon nucleic acid (Hybond) and protein (polyvinylidene difluoride) transfer membranes were purchased from Amersham Corp. (Arlington Heights, IL). The Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase was obtained from List Biological Laboratories, Inc. (Campbell, CA). Recombinant Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF)-1 and RhoA mutants were kindly provided by K. Aktories (University of Freiberg, Germany) and W. Moolenaar (Netherlands Cancer Institute, Netherlands), respectively. Human vascular SMC were isolated from outgrowths of tunica media explants derived from human aortic and saphenous vein tissues as described previously (14Shin W.S. Hong Y-H. Peng H-B. De Caterina R. Libby P. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11317-11324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cells of two to four passages were grown in culture medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Hyclone, Logan, UT), and antibiotic mixture of penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml)/Fungizone (1.25 μg/ml). The cells were characterized by phase-contrast microscopy and staining for SMC-specific α-actin. Confluent SMC were rendered quiescent by incubation in 0.4% FCS for 48 h before experiments. Cellular viability was determined by cell count, morphology, and trypan blue exclusion. For measurement of isoprenoid incorporation, SMC were treated with simvastatin (10 μm) for 24 h before addition of 50 μCi/ml [3H]GGPP or [3H]FPP, respectively. After 24 h, cells were washed four times with PBS. Aliquots of the cell lysates were counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckmann LS1800). Cell lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE as described (13Laufs U. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24266-24271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize protein loading and fixed according to the manufacturer's protocol (NEN Life Science Products). After vaccuum drying, autoradiography was performed for 4 weeks at −80 °C. Cellular lysates from membrane- and cytoplasma-enriched fractions were prepared and separated on SDS-PAGE as described (13Laufs U. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24266-24271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 15Spiecker M. Peng H.B. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30969-30974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The presence of Gαi2 and Rel A (p65) were used as specific markers of membrane and cytoplasmic fractions, respectively, as described previously (15Spiecker M. Peng H.B. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30969-30974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies using our high/low speed ultracentrifugation through sucrose gradient showed that the high-speed membrane fractions were relatively pure (i.e. presence of Gαi2 and absence of Rel A). Immunoblotting was performed using monoclonal antibodies against Rb (1:250, Pharmingen 14001A) and p21 Waf1 (F-5), p27 Kip1(C-19), p53 (DO-1), Ras (pan-Ras), RhoA (1:250 dilution,) and to c-myc tag (9E10, 1:200 dilution) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Immunodetection was accomplished using a sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:4000 dilution) or donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:4000 dilution) and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham Corp.). Autoradiography was performed at 23 °C and the appropriate exposures were quantitated by densitometry. SMC were grown to 80% confluence and growth-arrested by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.4% fetal calf serum (FCS) for 48 h. The media was then replaced with growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FCS containing 6 ng/ml PDGF), and the indicated reagents were simultaneously added. For experiments using FTI-276 and GGTI-286, these reagents were added 1 h before stimulation with PDGF. After 48 h, [3H]thymidine (10 μCi/ml) was added and the cells were incubated an additional 24 h. Cells were then washed 4 times in ice-cold PBS and lysed in glycerol-SDS lysis buffer. Incorporated radioactivity was determined using a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS 6000IC). The cyclin-dependent kinase assay was performed as described (15Spiecker M. Peng H.B. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30969-30974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cellular extracts were prepared with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 300 μm Na3VO4, 1 mmbenzamidine, 2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The Cdk-2, -4, and -6 were immunopreciptiated with 3 μg of the corresponding human Cdk-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) from 200 μg of total cellular lysates for 1 h at 4 °C. The Cdk-antibody complex was then precipitated with protein A-agarose and washed three times with PD buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 6 mm EDTA, 6 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 300 μm Na3VO4, 1 mmbenzamidine, 2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and once with kinase buffer (without ATP). The purified enzyme was then incubated with a full-length pRb-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (2 μg, Santa Cruz Biotech) as a substrate in 15 μl of kinase buffer containing Hepes (20 mm, pH 7.7), MgCl2 (10 mm), ATP (10 μm), 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, β-glycerophosphate (10 mm), sodium fluoride (10 mm), p-nitrophenyl phosphate (10 mm), Na3VO4 (300 μm), benzamidine (1 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 μm), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), and dithiothreitol (1 mm). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 times SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography of the dried gel was performed at −80 °C. SMC were seeded on washed microscope cover glasses placed into 6-well dishes. Cells (60–70% confluent) were transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA3-c-myc-wtRhoA (wild type RhoA) and pcDNA3-c-myc-N19RhoA (dominant-negative RhoA mutant) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) following the manufacturer's description. Both constructs contain a N-terminal c-myc tag. Approximately 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were washed and incubated overnight with mouse anti-c-myc and rabbit anti-p27 Kip1 antibody (1:50 in 1% bovine serum albumin) at 4 °C. After washing with 1% bovine serum albumin, tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (red fluorescence) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (green fluorescence) (Jackson Labs Inc., West Grove, PA) were used as secondary antibodies (1:500 in 1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h in the dark. Cells were then washed five times with PBS and mounted onto glass slides using the ProLong Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Immunofluorescence was visualized using an Olympus BX 60F inverted fluorescence microscope. Photographic images were taken from five random fields. Band intensities from Western blots and kinase assays were analyzed densitometrically by the National Institutes of Health Image Program (16Rasband W. NIH Image Program, version 1.49. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda1993Google Scholar). All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. compared with controls and among separate experiments. Paired and unpaired Student's t tests were employed to determine the significance of changes in densitometric measurements. A significant difference was taken for p< 0.05. Relatively pure (>98%) human SMC were confirmed by phase-contrast microscopy and staining for SMC-specific α-actin (data not shown). There was no observable adverse effects of mevastatin (<20 μm), simvastatin (<10 μm), FPP, GGPP, C3 transferase, or CNF-1 on cellular viability. However, higher concentrations of mevastatin (>50 μm) or simvastatin (Sim, >20 μm) were avoided because of toxicity. For measurement of isoprenoid incorporation, SMC were treated with simvastatin (10 μm) for 24 h before addition of 50 μCi/ml [3H]GGPP or 50 μCi/ml [3H]FPP. SDS-PAGE and scintillation counting of cell lysates after 24 h revealed that 18 ± 2% of [3H]GGPP and 17 ± 3% of [3H]FPP were taken up by SMC. SDS-PAGE showed multiple bands in the [3H]FPP-treated cell lysates including one at 21–23 kDa, whereas [3H]GGPP-treated cell lysates showed labeling of only one prominent band at 21–23 kDa (data not shown). These findings suggest that both GGPP and FPP are taken up by SMC under our experimental condition. Similar results were also obtained using radiolabeled geranylgeranol and farnesol. To determine the contribution of isoprenoid synthesis to PDGF-stimulated SMC cell cycle progression, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of Sim (1–10 μm) for 24 h. By [3H]thymidine incorporation, Sim inhibited SMC DNA synthesis by 94 ± 0.3% which was completely reversed by co-treatment with mevalonate (200 μm) (Fig. 1A). Mevalonate alone, however, had no effect on [3H]thymidine uptake (not shown). This decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation by Sim correlated with a concentration-dependent decrease in Rb hyperphosphorylation by 98 ± 4% (Fig. 1B). Similar effects were oberved with another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, mevastatin (data not shown). Inhibition of SMC DNA synthesis was independent of extracellular cholesterol concentration since all cells were cultured in 10% fetal calf serum under cholesterol-clamped conditions. Furthermore, addition of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (1 mg/ml) did not reverse the effects of Sim on [3H]thymidine incorporation (not shown). These findings suggest that isoprenoid synthesis is important in PDGF-induced SMC DNA synthesis. The entry into and progression of the cell cycle is regulated by holoenzyme complexes consisting of cyclins and Cdks (5Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4312) Google Scholar). To determine whether isoprenoids can regulate Cdk activity, we measured the effect of Sim on PDGF-induced Cdk-2, Cdk-4, and Cdk-6 activity. Using glutathioneS-transferase-Rb fusion protein as substrate for Cdk, we found that quiescent SMC have little or no Cdk-2, -4, and -6 activity (Fig. 2). Stimulation with PDGF (6 ng/ml, 24 h) increased Cdk-2, -4, and -6 activity. Co-treatment with Sim (5 μm) inhibited PDGF-induced Cdk-2, -4, and -6 kinase activity by 80 ± 5, 60 ± 3, and 48 ± 3%, respectively. Thus, inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis down-regulated Cdk activity with the greatest decrease observed with Cdk-2. The Cdk inhibitors such as p16, p21 Waf1 and p27 Kip1 bind to and inhibit the activation of Cdk·cyclin complexes. The tumor suppressor gene p53 regulates cell cycle progression, in part, by up-regulating the expression of p21 Waf1 (1Braun-Dullaeus R.C. Mann M.J. Dzau V.J. Circulation. 1998; 98: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). To determine whether inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis can affect the expression of Cdk inhibitors, we investigated the effects of Sim (5 μm) on p16, p21 Waf1, p27 Kip1, and p53 levels in SMC stimulated with PDGF (6 ng/ml) for 12, 24, and 36 h. Compared with PDGF alone, we find that Sim did not affect the levels of p16 and p21 Waf1 (Fig. 3). In contrast, stimulation with PDGF decreased p27 Kip1 by 80 ± 7, 95 ± 3, and 75 ± 8% after 12, 24, and 36 h, respectively. Co-treatment with Sim (5 μm) reversed the down-regulation of p27 Kip1 by PDGF resulting in 20-fold increase in p27 Kip1 after 24 h compared to that of PDGF. Although p53 levels decline in a time-dependent manner after PDGF stimulation, the levels were not different in the presence or absence of Sim. These findings indicate that inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis by Sim preferentially up-regulates p27 Kip1levels and suggest that p27 Kip1 may be involved in the inhibition of Cdk-2 activity. The small GTPases of the Ras and Rho family have been shown to regulate entry into the cell cycle (17Mulcahy L.S. Smith M.R. Stacey D.W. Nature. 1985; 313: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 18Pendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzuwa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2289-2296PubMed Google Scholar). Ras and Rho are post-translationally modified by isoprenylation which is necessary for their membrane localization and function (11Casey P.J. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Ras farnesylation and Rho geranylgeranylation are required for their membrane-associated GTPase activity (13Laufs U. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24266-24271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Stimulation with PDGF (6 ng/ml, 24 h) increased the level of membrane-bound RhoA by 420 ± 20% without significantly affecting the total amount of RhoA in smooth muscle cells (Fig. 4). Inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis by Sim (5 μm) completely reversed and prevented PDGF-induced RhoA membrane localization. Interestingly, in the presence of PDGF, Sim increased the total cellular expression of RhoA possibly to compensate for decreases in membrane-associated RhoA activity. Indeed, co-treatment with GGPP, but not FPP reversed the effect of Sim on RhoA membrane localization. Interestingly, the expression of Ras in SMC membranes was not significantly altered by treatment with PDGF or Sim after 24 h (Fig. 4). In total cell lysates, however, treatment with Sim resulted in the appearance of a higher molecular weight non-farnesylated Ras. Previous studies have demonstrated that farnesylated Ras migrates slightly faster on SDS-PAGE than unmodified Ras (19Hohl R.J. Lewis K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17508-17512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 13Laufs U. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24266-24271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Indeed, the shifted band corresponding to non-farnesylated Ras in SMC treated with PDGF and Sim is absent in the presence of FPP, but not GGPP. These findings confirm that inhibition of geranylgeranylation by Sim specifically prevents PDGF-induced membrane localization of Rho, but not Ras. To determine which isoprenoid intermediate down-regulates p27 Kip1, PDGF (6 ng/ml)-induced SMC were treated with Sim (5 μm) in the presence or absence of GGPP (5 μm) and FPP (5 μm). Co-treatment with GGPP, but not FPP, completely reversed the up-regulation of p27 Kip1 by Sim (Fig. 5A). Since Rho is a major target for geranylgeranylation, we investigated whether inhibition of Rho up-regulates p27 Kip1. Treatment of SMC with C. botulinum C3 transferase (50 μg/ml, 24 h), an exoenzyme which specifically inactivates Rho by ADP-ribosylation (20Aktories K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 12: S11-S13Google Scholar), completely prevented the PDGF-induced down-regulation of p27 Kip1 (Fig. 5B). To determine whether changes in p27 Kip1 are specific to inhibition of Rho, we transfected SMC with wild-type RhoA (wtRhoA) and a dominant-negative RhoA (N19RhoA). Both of these RhoA constructs contain a N-terminal c-myc tag. The transfection efficiency as measured by β-galactosidase fluorescence and c-mycimmunofluorescence is approximately 8–10%. Using dual immunofluoresecent microscopy, overexpression of wtRhoA in PDGF-induced SMC did not change p27 Kip1 expression relative to non-transfected cells (i.e. cells without c-mycimmunofluorescence) (Fig. 6). In contrast, SMC overexpressing the dominant-negative N19RhoA mutant, as identified by co-staining for c-myc, showed increased p27 Kip1 expression. Taken together, these findings indicate that RhoA negatively regulates p27 Kip1 expression and suggest that Sim up-regulates p27 Kip1 by inhibiting Rho membrane localization and activity. To determine the effects of Rho on cell cycle progression, we investigated the effects of PDGF (6 ng/ml), Sim (5 μm), GGPP (5 μm), FPP (5 μm), or C3 transferase (50 μg/ml) on Rb hyperphosphorylation in SMC after 24 h. Co-treatment with GGPP, and to a much lesser extent FPP, reversed the inhibitory effect of Sim on PDGF-induced Rb hyperphosphorylation in SMC (Fig. 7A). Direct inactivation of Rho by C3 transferase decreased Rb hyperphosphorylation by 80 ± 7%. This decrease in Rb hyperphosphorylation by C3 transferase was not reversed by GGPP or FPP (data not shown). When SMC was treated withE. coli CNF-1 (200 ng/ml) which is known to directly activate Rho by blocking Rho GTP hydrolysis (21Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 22Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), Rb became hyperphosphorylated in the absence of fetal calf serum (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum in the culture medium, CNF-1 augmented Rb hyperphosphorylation by approximately 2-fold. Compared with treatment with PDGF (6 ng/ml), thymidine incorporation was inhibited in the presence of Sim (6 ± 0.3% incorporation,p < 0.001) (Fig. 8A). Co-treatment with GGPP (5 μm) reversed the inhibitory effect of Sim (88 ± 6% incorporation, p > 0.05 compared with PDGF), where as FPP (5 μm) only partially reversed the effects of Sim (48 ± 4% incorporation, p < 0.01 compared with PDGF). Co-treatment with low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (1 mg/ml) did not reverse the inhibitory effects of simvastatin (p > 0.05). Co-treatment with CNF-1 (200 ng/ml) increased thymidine incorporation by 42 ± 2% while co-treatment with C3 transferase (50 μg/ml) reduced thymidine incorporation by 56 ± 1% (p < 0.05 for both compared with PDGF). To determine the degree that geranylgeranylation and farnesylation contribute to PDGF-induced SMC DNA synthesis, we investigated the effects of inhibitors of geranylgeranyltransferase and farnesyltransferase on PDGF-induced thymidine incorporation. The geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor (GGTI-286, 30 μm) decreased PDGF (6 ng/ml)-induced thymidine incorporation by 91 ± 5% (p < 0.01) while the farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI-276, 10 nm) decreased PDGF (6 ng/ml)-induced thymidine incorporation by 37 ± 4% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 8B). We have shown that the isoprenoid, geranylgeranyl, and the protein that it post-translationally modifies, Rho, mediates PDGF-induced cell cycle progression by down-regulating the expression of the Cdk inhibitor p27 Kip1 and stimulating the activity of Cdk-2 and hyperphosphorylation of Rb. Treatment with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, simvastatin, decreases Rho geranylgeranylation and membrane localization, inhibits Cdk activity and Rb hyperphosphorylation, and prevents SMC DNA synthesis. Indeed, Rho-induced Rb hyperphosphorylation and DNA synthesis are necessary and sufficient for serum- or PDGF-induced SMC DNA synthesis and are associated with decreases in p27 Kip1 expression. These findings indicate an important role of Rho in PDGF-stimulated mitogenesis and are consistent with studies showing that p27 Kip1 accumulation mediates cell cycle arrest (23Hengst L. Reed S.I. Science. 1996; 271: 1861-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 24Weber J.D. Hu W. Jefcoat S.C. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32966-32971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and that the degradation of p27 Kip1 facilitates the growth of rat FRTL-5 cells (25Hirai A. Nakamura S. Noguchi Y. Yasuda T. Kitagawa M. Tatsuno I. Oeda T. Tahara K. Terano T. Narumiya S. Kohn L.D. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Our findings, however, are in contrast to previous studies which suggest that PDGF-induced SMC DNA synthesis is mediated predominantly by Ras (17Mulcahy L.S. Smith M.R. Stacey D.W. Nature. 1985; 313: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The Rho GTPase family which includes RhoA, RhoB, Rac, Cdc42 are major substrates for post-translational modification by geranylgeranylation. Geranylgeranyl modification is important for cellular trafficking and targets these Rho GTPases to the cellular membrane (10Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4548) Google Scholar, 26Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). The membrane translocation of inactive or GDP-bound Rho involves the release of its cytoplasmic inhibitor, Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor, and activation of Rho through GDP/GTP exchange in the presence of guanine nucleotide exchange factor (27Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar, 28Gosser Y.Q. Nomanbhoy T.K. Aghazadeh B. Manor D. Combs C. Cerione R.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 814-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 29Gebbink M. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Since most of the cytoplasmic Rho proteins are inactive (GDP-bound state), their GTP binding activity remains invariably low even in the presence of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor treatment. Thus, inhibition of Rho geranylgeranylation and membrane translocation by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors leads to a greater accumulation of inactive Rho in the cytoplasm. This is consistent with our finding that in the presence of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, addition of GGPP, but not FPP, restores membrane expression of Rho, decreases p27 Kip1 levels, and enhances cell cycle progression. Interestingly, in addition to increasing RhoA activity by GTP loading, we find that stimulation with PDGF increases the amount of membrane-associated RhoA. The mechanism by which PDGF increases RhoA in the membrane, however, remains to be determined. The importance of Rho in SMC DNA synthesis was further confirmed by studies showing that inhibition of Rho by C. botulinum C3 transferase also inhibits SMC DNA synthesis. The C3 transferase ADP-ribosylates asparagine 41 of RhoA and RhoB and renders them biologically inactive in the GDP-bound state (20Aktories K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 12: S11-S13Google Scholar). Although under certain circumstances, the C3 transferase may also ADP-ribosylate Rac-1 or Cdc42 (20Aktories K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 12: S11-S13Google Scholar, 21Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), our results showing that the overexpression of a dominant-negative RhoA mutant, N19RhoA, also increases p27 Kip1expression are consistent with the inhibitory effects of C3 transferase on Rho. In contrast, direct activation of Rho by E. coliCNF-1 reversed the inhibitory effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Interestingly, CNF-1 alone was sufficient to augment and induce SMC cell cycle progression in the presence and absence of serum, respectively. These findings indicate that Rho GTPase is a predominant mediator of PDGF-induced SMC DNA synthesis. Our results suggest that cell cycle progression is mediated by Rho-dependent down-regulation of the Cdk inhibitor p27 Kip1. In contrast, Rho has been shown to decrease p21 Waf1 but not p27 Kip1 levels in NIH 3T3 cells (30Olson M.F. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1998; 394: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Indeed, another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, has been shown to increase the level of p21 Waf1 in prostate cancer cells (31Lee S.J. Ha M.J. Lee J. Nguyen P.M. Choi Y.H. Pirnia F. Kang W-K. Wang X-F. Kim S-J. Trepel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10618-10623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Our studies with human vascular SMC, however, showed no effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on p21 Waf1 or p16 expression. Thus, cell cycle arrest in SMC induced by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors appears to be mediated by mechanisms which are independent of p21 Waf1 and p16 levels. Another important tumor suppressor gene which is involved in cell cycle regulation is p53 (2Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4976) Google Scholar, 32Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6740) Google Scholar). Since up-regulation of p53 was not observed after inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis, SMC growth arrest by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors probably also occurred by mechanisms which are independent of p53 levels. These results are consistent with the absence of changes in p21 Waf1levels which has been shown in previous studies to be induced by p53 (32Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6740) Google Scholar). In contrast to p16 and p21 Waf1, p27 Kip1 levels are increased by treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and the up-regulation of p27 Kip1 correlated with the inhibition of Cdk-2 activity, and to a lesser extent, Cdk-4 and -6 activity. Both Ras and Rho have been shown to play pivotal roles in the regulation of growth in a variety of cell types. In contrast to GGPP, addition of FPP only partially reversed the inhibitory effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on SMC DNA synthesis by 50%, suggesting that Ras farnesylation alone may not be the predominant mediator of PDGF-induced SMC DNA synthesis. This may be due to the fact that after 24 h of treatment, there was no effect of PDGF, GGPP, or FPP on the level of Ras in the cellular membrane. These findings are consistent with recent studies showing that the translocation of Rho, but not Ras, to the membrane corresponds with cell cycle progression from G1 to S in FRTL-5 cells (33Vogt A. Qian Y. McGuire T.F. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1991-1999PubMed Google Scholar, 34Noguchi Y. Nakamura S. Yasuda T. Kitagawa M. Kohn L.D. Saito Y. Hirai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3649-3653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and that GGPP completely reversed the up-regulation of p27 Kip1 by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, whereas FPP had little or no effect on p27 Kip1. However, a recent study demonstrates that Ras and Rho GTPases both interact to regulate p21 Waf1 and cell cycle progression in NIH 3T3 cells (30Olson M.F. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1998; 394: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Further studies, therefore, are needed to determine the precise role of Ras in PDGF-induced SMC cell cycle progression. Recent clinical data suggest that some of the beneficial effects of treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may occur independent of changes in serum cholesterol levels (35Packard C. J. for the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study Group Circulation. 1998; 97: 1440-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that there is a direct effect of these agents on the vessel wall via inhibition of Rho geranylgeranylation. We propose that Rho is a necessary and sufficient mediator of SMC cell cycle progression and that inhibition of Rho in SMC may have beneficial effects in vascular proliferative diseases such as atherosclerosis and post-angioplasty re-stenosis. The precise mechanism(s) by which Rho up-regulates p27 Kip1expression, however, remains to be determined. We thank K. Aktories, W. Moolenaar, and P. Libby for kindly providing CNF-1, RhoA mutants, and human vascular smooth muscle cells, respectively. We are also grateful to Todd Bourcier for assistance in the GGPP/FPP labeling assays."
https://openalex.org/W2093501456,"Prior studies have demonstrated that the pineal hormone, melatonin, can stimulate chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in Drosophila SL-3 cells transfected with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct containing the response element of rat bone sialoprotein (BSP). Based on these findings, studies were performed to determine whether melatonin could similarly modulate the expression of BSP in two cell lines, the MC3T3-E1(MC3T3) pre-osteoblast and rat osteoblast-like osteosarcoma 17/2.8 cell. Initial studies demonstrated that MC3T3 cells grown in the presence of 50 nm melatonin underwent cell differentiation and mineralization by day 12 instead of the 21-day period normally required for cells grown in untreated media. Melatonin increased gene expression of BSP and the other bone marker proteins, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP); osteopontin; secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine; and osteocalcin in MC3T3 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Levels of melatonin as low as 10 nm were capable of stimulating transcription of these genes when cells were grown in the presence of β-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid. Under these conditions, melatonin induced gene expression of the bone marker proteins; however, this does not occur until the 5th day after seeding the culture dishes. Thereafter, MC3T3 cells responded to melatonin within 2 h of treatment. The fully differentiated rat osteoblast-like osteosarcoma 17/2.8 cells responded rapidly to melatonin and displayed an increase in the expression of BSP, ALP, and osteocalcin genes within 1 h of exposure to the hormone. To determine whether melatonin-induced osteoblast differentiation and bone formation are mediated via the transmembrane receptor, MC3T3 cells were treated in the presence and absence of melatonin with either luzindole, a competitive inhibitor of the binding of melatonin to the transmembrane receptors, or pertussis toxin, an uncoupler of Gi from adenylate cyclase. Both luzindole and pertussis toxin were shown to reduce melatonin-induced expression of BSP and ALP. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that the pineal hormone, melatonin, is capable of promoting osteoblast differentiation and mineralization of matrix in culture and suggest that this hormone may play an essential role in regulating bone growth.

These results demonstrate, for the first time, that the pineal hormone, melatonin, is capable of promoting osteoblast differentiation and mineralization of matrix in culture and suggest that this hormone may play an essential role in regulating bone growth. Melatonin is the major hormone released from the pineal gland, and its levels are synchronized by environmental light with nightly plasma concentrations reaching approximately 50 times higher than that reached during daytime (1Lynch H.J.

In light of this, melatonin has been proclaimed to be a cure-all for everything from treating insomnia and cancer to acting as an anti-aging agent (16Pierpaoli W. Dall'ara A. Pedrinis E. Regelson W.

In regard to melatonin actions as an anti-aging agent, it is known that secretion of the hormone is decreased during the aging process, and when administered to aging animals, it is capable of increasing their life span by almost 20% (16Pierpaoli W.

The presence of the response element for the RZR in BSP is interesting in light of the fact that melatonin has never been implicated in the regulation of bone disposition. The results of these studies reveal that melatonin can increase the expression of BSP as well as several other essential bone marker proteins including ALP and OC and, in addition, stimulate both osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. MC3T3 cells (a clonal preosteoblastic cell line originated from newborn mouse calvaria) were plated (8 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) and grown to confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics (growth media). Media were changed every other day. To study the spontaneous differentiation of MC3T3 cells into osteoblasts, cells were cultured for up to 21 days in growth media containing ascorbic acid (AA; 50 μg/ml) and β-glycerophosphate (GP; 10 mm) (differentiation medium). Melatonin, dissolved in Me2SO, was added to the culture media as described under “Results.” Control cultures received an equivalent quantity of Me2SO. ROS cells (a gift from Dr. G. Rodan, Merck Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories, West Point, PA), an osteoblast-like cell line, were plated (7 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) and grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 28 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm l-glutamine, 1.1 mmCaCl2, 5% FBS, and antibiotics (growth media). For time course studies, cells grown in 60-mm dishes were kept overnight in low serum (1%) containing growth media and then treated for 1–72 h with GP/AA and 50 nm melatonin. MC3T3 cells and ROS cells were plated in 24-multiwell dishes (Becton Dickinson Laboratory, Lincoln Park, NJ) at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well and cultured for 24 h in growth media containing 10% FBS. To assess the effects of melatonin on cell proliferation, cells were incubated in growth media containing 2% FBS for 24 h and then treated for 1, 2, 4, and 6 days with the following: 1) GP and AA; 2) melatonin alone; 3) GP, AA, and melatonin; 4) GP, AA, and osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1, 40 ng/ml); and 5) no treatment. Cell number was assessed using a Coulter Z1 cell counter (Coulter Corporation, Miami, FL) after trypsinization and presented as the mean ± S.D. of triplicates. Confluent MC3T3 cells grown on 60-mm dishes were treated with GP/AA and 50 nm melatonin in the presence and absence of either pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) (List Biological Laboratories, Inc., Campbell, CA) or luzindole (0.2 and 2 μm) (Sigma) for the time indicated. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern blot analysis as described below. In other experiments, cells cultured for 7 days in the presence of GP/AA were treated for 2 h with either 2 μm luzindole or 100 ng/ml of pertussis toxin. Cells were subsequently treated for an additional 2 h with 50 nm melatonin, and the RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern blot analysis. Total RNA was prepared by guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA samples (10–20 μg/lane) were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, transferred to Nytran Plus membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) using a turboblotter (Schleicher and Schuell), and cross-linked to the membrane using a UVC-508 Ultraviolet Crosslinker (ULTRA-LUM Inc., Carson, CA). Membranes were hybridized overnight at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution, 5× SSPE (sodium chloride/sodium phosphate/EDTA), 0.5% SDS containing 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and 32P-labeled cDNAs using a Hybaid mini hybridization oven (Labnet, Woodbridge, NJ). The blots were washed in 2× SSPE at room temperature in 1× and 0.1× SSPE at 65 °C and subsequently exposed to Kodak X-OMAT film at −80 °C using two intensifying screens. For rehybridization, membranes were stripped in boiling 0.1% SDS solution. The cDNA probes used for Northern blot analysis include a rat type I collagen cDNA insert of 1.6 kb (Dr. D. W. Rowe, Farmington, CT); a rat OPN cDNA insert of 1.4 kb (Dr. B. B. Mukherjee, McGill University, Montreal, Canada); mouse secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) cDNA insert of 1.16 kb (Dr. B. L. M. Hogan, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN); a rat ALP cDNA insert of 2.5 kb (Dr. G. A. Rodan, Merck Sharpe and Dohme Research Laboratories, West Point, PA); a rat BSP cDNA insert of 1.05 kb (Dr. J. Sodek, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada); a rat OC cDNA insert of 0.327 kb (Drs. A. Gupta and J. E. Aubin, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada); and a rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA insert of 1.2 kb (Dr. P. Bradford, SUNY at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY). The cDNA probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) using a DECA prime DNA labeling kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). The radioactive bands were normalized to the actual amount of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA loaded or the ethidium bromide stained 28 S ribosomal RNA. MC3T3 cells were plated (2.7 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) and cultured in untreated differentiation media for 12 and 21 days or in the media containing 50 nm melatonin for 12 days. To detect mineralized nodules formed in vitro, cultures were fixed in 10% neutral formalin buffer, stained with silver nitrate, treated with sodium carbonate formaldehyde, and washed with distilled water. The culture dishes were photographed using a Nikon camera equipped with a macrolens. To examine whether melatonin promotes the formation and mineralization of nodules by MC3T3 cells in vitro, cells were grown to confluency on a 35-mm dish and treated for 2 weeks with GP/AA/melatonin. The cells were subsequently processed for embedding in Epon as described previously (40Cho M.I. Matsuda N. Lin W.-L. Moshier A. Ramakrishnan P.R. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1992; 50: 459-467Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 2.5% gluteraldehyde in 0.1m cacodylate buffer, postfixed in 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m s-collidine buffer, en bloc-stained with 1% uranyl acetate, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon mixture. Ultrathin sections were cut on an Ultracut E microtome equipped with a diamond knife, double stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and photographed with a Hitachi H-600 electron microscope. MC3T3 cells are pre-osteoblastic cells that differentiate into mature osteoblasts when grown in the presence of GP and AA (41Sudo H. Kodama H.A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). Differentiation of these cells to mature osteoblasts normally requires incubation in the presence of both GP and AA for at least 21 days at which time mineralization occurs (42Matsumoto T. Igarashi C. Takeuchi Y. Harada S. Kituchi T. Yamato H. Ogata E. Bone (NY). 1991; 12: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1, melatonin (50 nm) induced cell differentiation by day 12 equivalent to or greater than that for cells grown for 21 days in the absence of the hormone. Along with increased differentiation, the time period for mineralization was also greatly accelerated in cultures treated with melatonin (Fig. 2). Cultures containing melatonin at day 12 showed extensive mineralization as compared with control cultures grown for 21 days in the absence of melatonin.Figure 2Photomicrographs of von Kossa-stained MC3T3 control and melatonin-treated cells. MC3T3 cells were plated on 35-mm culture dishes at a density of 2.7 × 105cells/dish. Cultures were stained at 0 (A), 21 days (B), after treatment with GP/AA only, and 12 days after treatment with melatonin/GP/AA (C). Cultures were treated with von Kossa stain to visualize mineralized nodules and photographed using a Nikon camera equipped with a macro lens.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As illustrated by the photomicrographs in Fig. 3, two weeks after treatment with melatonin, nodules were composed of multilayers of cells and densely packed collagen fibrils in the intercellular spaces with heavy mineral deposits preferentially located in the lower half of the nodules. As noted in the inset of Fig. 3, hydroxyapatite crystals were associated with the collagen fibrils. Based on prior observations demonstrating that morphogenic agents such as OP-1, which stimulate osteoblast differentiation and mineralization, also suppress cell division (30Zhumabayeva B.D. Lin W-L. Choung P-W. Chien H-H. Sodek J. Sampath K.T. Cho M-I. Int. J. of Oral Biol. 1999; 23: 91-101Google Scholar), studies were performed to examine the effect of melatonin on MC3T3 and ROS cell proliferation. As indicated by the data in Fig. 4A, suppression of MC3T3 cell division by melatonin was equivalent to that produced by OP-1 at day 1 after initiating treatment. However, unlike OP-1, this inhibitory effect subsided by day 2 for cells grown in the presence of melatonin. As illustrated in Fig. 4B, melatonin also appeared to suppress cell proliferation in the fully differentiated ROS cells, although this response never reached statistical significance. Thus, unlike OP-1, melatonin (50 nm) may not fully suppress cell proliferation but instead may only delay entry of the osteoblast cells into the cell cycle after plating. During MC3T3 cell differentiation induced by GP/AA, there is a selective and time-dependent induction of several proteins required for bone matrix formation. The mRNA for type I collagen, SPARC, and OP are all expressed early, and this is normally followed by increased mRNA expression of osteoblast markers such as BSP, ALP, and lastly OC. Because the gene for BSP has been reported to possess the response element for RZR, experiments were performed to determine the effect of melatonin on gene expression of BSP as well as the other proteins expressed during differentiation of MC3T3 cells. As illustrated in Fig. 5, concentrations of melatonin as low as 10 nm were sufficient to stimulate transcription of the BSP gene by day 12 after initiating treatment. Of the other marker proteins examined, expression of the ALP gene was also found to be up-regulated at similar concentrations of melatonin, suggesting that this gene may also be directly responsive to the actions of the purported nuclear receptor for melatonin, RZR. In these experiments, melatonin had considerably less effect on the gene expression of OPN, SPARC, and collagen as compared with the control cultures grown in differentiation media. There was a very small increase in OC mRNA levels in cultures treated with 50 nm melatonin, but this could only be detected by exposing the blots to the film for 5–7 days. These data demonstrate that melatonin is capable of consistently stimulating the expression of the major proteins during MC3T3 cell differentiation. It was also of interest to determine the time course during MC3T3 cell differentiation induced by melatonin that increased gene expression of BSP and ALP occurred. As illustrated by the data in Fig. 6, the observed increase in expression of the BSP and ALP genes was not detected until sometime between days 5 and 9 after continuous exposure to the hormone. Increased expression of ALP occurred by day 5 and developed prior to that of BSP, consistent with previous studies demonstrating that ALP expression occurs early during osteoblast differentiation. Along with increased expression of BSP and ALP, we also observed increases in mRNA levels for OPN and SPARC when compared with that in control cultures. Like ALP, increased expression of OPN is also an early event marker for osteoblast differentiation, and this increase is observed by day 5 after beginning treatment with melatonin. In contrast, the appearance of SPARC during MC3T3 differentiation resembled that for BSP. Melatonin again had little effect on either type I collagen or OC expression, although, as noted above, there was a small but significant increase in the expression of the latter gene by day 12 when membranes were exposed to film for 7 days. Control cultures maintained in the absence of melatonin required longer incubation times for gene expression of the bone marker proteins. The delay observed in melatonin-induced expression of mRNA for BSP and ALP suggests that during the early phases of cell differentiation either de novo synthesis or activation of one or more essential proteins must occur in order for the cells to respond to melatonin. Thus, it was of interest to determine the time point during differentiation when MC3T3 cells first become responsive to melatonin. For these experiments, cells were grown in differentiation media in the absence of melatonin for the time periods specified in Fig. 7. Melatonin was added at the specified time periods, and 2 h later cells were screened for expression of the bone marker proteins. Results of these experiments demonstrated that MC3T3 cells must undergo differentiation for a minimum of 5–7 days before melatonin is capable of stimulating the expression of BSP and ALP. In these experiments, melatonin was also found to increase the expression of both collagen and OC genes. Based on these results, it may be expected that melatonin would induce gene expression of the bone marker proteins more rapidly in a fully differentiated osteoblastic cell that possibly already expresses the necessary components to respond to melatonin. The ROS cell is a fully differentiated osteoblast-like cell line that expresses bone marker proteins when grown in the presence of GP/AA. As illustrated in Fig. 8, when these cells were exposed to 50 nm melatonin in the presence of GP/AA, there was a rapid increase in the expression of BSP and OC genes. Induction of these three genes in ROS cells was observed within 1 h of treatment with melatonin and was not effected by cycloheximide treatment for 4 h (data not shown), indicating that de novo synthesis of additional proteins is not required for increased expression of the three bone marker protein genes. To determine whether melatonin-induced osteoblast differentiation and bone formation are mediated via the interaction of the hormone with the transmembrane receptor, MC3T3 cells were treated in the presence and absence of melatonin with either luzindole, a competitive inhibitor of the binding of melatonin to the transmembrane receptors (20Dubocovich M.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 50-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), or pertussis toxin, an uncoupler of Gi from adenylate cyclase (22Yung L.Y. Tsim S.-T. Wong Y.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Expression of mRNA for ALP and BSP was examined using Northern blot analysis. Results of these studies, illustrated in Figs.9 and 10, reveal that both luzindole and pertussis toxin are capable of reducing melatonin-induced expression of both BSP and ALP. As illustrated in Fig. 9, concentrations of luzindole as low as 2 × 10−7m were found to completely block melatonin-induced increases in the expression of both BSP and AP at 9 and 12 days of treatment as compared with cells treated with melatonin alone. Similar results were observed (Fig. 10) after treatment with pertussis toxin, suggesting that melatonin-induced expression of both BSP and ALP is mediated by a cAMP-dependent process initiated by the binding of the hormone to its transmembrane receptor.Figure 10Effects of pertussis toxin on MC3T3 cell differentiation. MC3T3 cells were treated with GP, AA, and 50 nm melatonin or GP, AA, melatonin, and pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml), an inhibitor of Gi and cAMP formation. Total RNA was isolated, and expression of ALP and BSP was examined using Northern blot analysis on the days indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To demonstrate that the effects of luzindole and pertussis toxin were not caused by their excessive accumulation in the above studies, experiments were performed in which cells were exposed to these agents for 2 h in the presence of melatonin. In these experiments, MC3T3 cells were initially pretreated with either luzindole or pertussis toxin for 2 h prior to the addition of melatonin. Cells were incubated for an additional 2 h, and mRNA levels for BSP and ALP were subsequently assessed. As illustrated in Fig. 11, luzindole suppressed melatonin-induced expression of BSP, whereas pertussis toxin suppressed expression of both BSP and ALP. These data are consistent with the effects of melatonin being mediated by the transmembrane receptor. MC3T3 and ROS cells were chosen for this study because both cell lines produce BSP and undergo cell differentiation and mineralization when exposed to a variety of agents that increase the expression of this gene. Based on studies in the literature revealing that BSP contains the appropriate response element for RZR, studies were undertaken to determine whether melatonin could also stimulate the expression of this regulatory protein and induce differentiation and matrix mineralization in these osteoblastic cell lines. As one of the major secretory proteins of osteoblasts, BSP functions to regulate mineralization possibly by its direct interaction with cell surface integrin receptors (37Oldberg Å. Franzén A.

A. 1993; 90: 8562-8565Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Increased expression of BSP along with that of several other bone marker proteins is required to induce mineralization. When MC3T3 cells are grown in the presence of GP/AA, BSP expression and mineralization are normally not observed until 21 days after initiating treatment (41Sudo H. Kodama H.A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). A number of hormones and growth factors can stimulate the expression of BSP as well as ALP, SPARC, OPN, and OC and thus, facilitate MC3T3 cell differentiation and mineralization (43Sodek J. Kim R.H.

Sodek J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 65: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Results reported in this paper reveal that melatonin can similarly promote MC3T3 cell differentiation and mineralization. However, unlike these other growth factors, melatonin only slightly suppresses MC3T3 cell growth and only minimally increases the expression of OC. In an attempt to ascertain whether the transmembrane receptors are involved in mediating the actions of melatonin, studies were performed to determine whether short and long term exposure to luzindole and pertussis toxin could attenuate the actions of melatonin. Both long and short term exposure to pertussis toxin and luzindole suppressed melatonin-induced BSP expression. Long term exposure to these agents also resulted in reduced expression of ALP, whereas only pertussis toxin diminished ALP expression upon short term exposure. These data suggest that the transmembrane receptor via signaling through the Gi protein is likely initiating the actions of melatonin in MC3T3 cells. This is further supported by our preliminary findings tentatively identifying the Mel R1b receptor in these cells. The question still remains as to whether the putative nuclear orphan receptor, RZR, is also involved in mediating the actions of this hormone in MC3T3 cells. Because RZR is reported to be regulated by cAMP (47Baler R. Coon S. Klein D.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 975-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to assume that the binding of melatonin to its transmembrane receptor will result in changes in the levels or activity of this nuclear transcription factor leading to alteration in the expression of BSP and ultimately osteoblast differentiation. Further evidence linking RZR with the observed melatonin-induced morphological changes in MC3T3 cells stems from the findings that the expression of ALP, OPN, SPARC, and OC along with BSP are all induced by melatonin. In this regard, it should be noted that the genes for these proteins also contain the appropriate base sequence, RGGTCA, within their promoter region required for RZR binding (48Zernik J.

In addition, preliminary studies with MC3T3 cells have further demonstrated that melatonin can suppress the expression of CRBP-I, a regulatory protein found in osteoblasts (53Harada H. Miki R. Masushige S. Kato S. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5329-5335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that also contains the RZR response element (45Mader S. Leroy P. Chen J.-Y. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the concentrations of melatonin found to suppress CRBP-I in MC3T3 are identical to that required to stimulate BSP expression, suggesting a common signaling mechanism for the two. The observation that melatonin can down-regulate the expression of CRBP-I is similar to the response observed with melatonin in human B lymphocytes for 5-lipoxygenase (27Steinhilber D. Brungs M. Werz O. Wiesenberg I. Danielsson C. Kahlem J.-P. Nayeri S. Schräder M. Carlberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7037-7040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that RZR, at the minimum, may lie in the pathway by which melatonin regulates transcription of the genes for BSP, CRBP-I, and possibly the other bone marker proteins as well. Our results reveal that MC3T3 cells must first undergo cell differentiation in the presence of GP/AA for approximately 5 days before they become responsive to melatonin. At this time, melatonin is capable of stimulating the gene expression of bone marker proteins within 2 h. A similar rapid response time to melatonin is also found in the fully differentiated ROS cells. This suggests that ROS cells, which are already fully differentiated, do not require thede novo protein synthesis of a regulatory factor responsible for controlling the actions of melatonin. In addition, preliminary studies have demonstrated that melatonin can also stimulate differentiation of primary osteoblast cells grown in culture 2T. M. Kim, W.-L. Lin, and M.-I. Cho, manuscript in preparation., confirming that the actions of melatonin are not restricted to transformed cells. In summary, the results reported in this paper demonstrate that the pineal hormone, melatonin, is capable of promoting differentiation and mineralization of osteoblast cells grown in culture. This is the first demonstration that melatonin has the potential to play an essential role in regulating bone growth. These findings place melatonin with a select handful of other agents including glucocorticoids, bone morphogenic proteins, and vitamin D3 that are known to stimulate mineralization in osteoblasts (30Zhumabayeva B.D.

Bone (NY). 1991; 12: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Because melatonin levels decrease during the aging process, the possibility must be considered that it may have a significant influence on the rate of synthesis and/or maintenance of bone in the elderly. As to whether this decrease in melatonin during aging contributes to osteoporosis or whether treatment with melatonin can prevent this disorder is not known but is currently under investigation.

https://openalex.org/W2027187941,"Widespread cerebral deposition of a 40–43-amino acid peptide called the amyloid β-protein (Aβ) in the form of amyloid fibrils is one of the most prominent neuropathologic features of Alzheimer's disease. Numerous studies suggest that Aβ is toxic to neurons by free radical-mediated mechanisms. We have previously reported that melatonin prevents oxidative stress and death of neurons exposed to Aβ. In the process of screening indole compounds for neuroprotection against Aβ, potent neuroprotective properties were uncovered for an endogenous related species, indole-3-propionic acid (IPA). This compound has previously been identified in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of humans, but its functions are not known. IPA completely protected primary neurons and neuroblastoma cells against oxidative damage and death caused by exposure to Aβ, by inhibition of superoxide dismutase, or by treatment with hydrogen peroxide. In kinetic competition experiments using free radical-trapping agents, the capacity of IPA to scavenge hydroxyl radicals exceeded that of melatonin, an indoleamine considered to be the most potent naturally occurring scavenger of free radicals. In contrast with other antioxidants, IPA was not converted to reactive intermediates with pro-oxidant activity. These findings may have therapeutic applications in a broad range of clinical situations."
https://openalex.org/W2027851046,"The loss of cell volume is a fundamental feature of apoptosis. We have previously shown that DNA degradation and caspase activity occur only in cells which have shrunken as a result of potassium and sodium efflux (Bortner, C. D., Hughes, F. M., Jr., and Cidlowski, J. A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 32436–32442). Furthermore, maintaining a normal intracellular potassium concentration represses the cell death process by inhibiting the activity of apoptotic nucleases and suppressing the activation of effector caspases (Hughes, F. M., Jr., Bortner, C. D. Purdy, G. D., and Cidlowski, J. A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 30567–30576). We have now investigated the relationship between cell shrinkage, ion efflux, and changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential, in addition to the role of caspases in these apoptotic events. Treatment of Jurkat cells with a series of inducers which act via distinct signal transduction pathways, resulted in all of the cell death characteristics including loss of cell viability, cell shrinkage, K+ efflux, altered mitochondrial membrane potential, and DNA fragmentation. Interestingly, only cells which shrunk had a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the other apoptotic characteristics. Treatment of Jurkat cells with an anti-Fas antibody in the presence of the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD, abrogated these features. In contrast, when Jurkat cells were treated with either the calcium ionophore A23187 or thapsigargin, z-VAD failed to prevent cell shrinkage, K+ efflux, or changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential, while effectively inhibiting DNA degradation. Treatment of Jurkat cells with various apoptotic agents in the presence of either the caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD, or the caspase-8 inhibitor IETD also blocked DNA degradation, but failed to prevent other characteristics of apoptosis. Together these data suggest that the cell shrinkage, K+ efflux, and changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential are tightly coupled, but occur independent of DNA degradation, and can be largely caspase independent depending on the particular signal transduction pathway. The loss of cell volume is a fundamental feature of apoptosis. We have previously shown that DNA degradation and caspase activity occur only in cells which have shrunken as a result of potassium and sodium efflux (Bortner, C. D., Hughes, F. M., Jr., and Cidlowski, J. A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 32436–32442). Furthermore, maintaining a normal intracellular potassium concentration represses the cell death process by inhibiting the activity of apoptotic nucleases and suppressing the activation of effector caspases (Hughes, F.

Treatment of Jurkat cells with an anti-Fas antibody in the presence of the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD, abrogated these features. In contrast, when Jurkat cells were treated with either the calcium ionophore A23187 or thapsigargin, z-VAD failed to prevent cell shrinkage, K+ efflux, or changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential, while effectively inhibiting DNA degradation. Treatment of Jurkat cells with various apoptotic agents in the presence of either the caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD, or the caspase-8 inhibitor IETD also blocked DNA degradation, but failed to prevent other characteristics of apoptosis. Together these data suggest that the cell shrinkage, K+ efflux, and changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential are tightly coupled, but occur independent of DNA degradation, and can be largely caspase independent depending on the particular signal transduction pathway. Apoptosis is characterized by a distinct set of morphological and biochemical features which differ substantially from those observed during necrosis (1Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12874) Google Scholar, 2Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev.

Characteristics of apoptosis include cell shrinkage, protein degradation, nuclear condensation and fragmentation, and eventual budding of the cells into what have been termed apoptotic bodies (2Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar, 3Schwartzman R.A. Cidlowski J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 133-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). In apoptosis, diverse external or internal signals trigger the cell death process, which is then executed by the activation of a central or common death pathway. Upon receipt of an apoptotic signal, cells activate numerous signaling pathways whose function is to modulate the cell death process. Modulators of cell death include proteins of the Bcl-2 family, p53, and various kinases and phosphatases, which condemn the cell to death through their action on intracellular effector molecules (4Hale A.J. Smith C.A. Sutherland L.C. Stoneman V.E. Longthorne V. Culhane A.C. Williams G.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Notable effector molecules include cytochrome c, proteases, and nucleases which ultimately cleave protein and DNA substrates, respectively. The pathway that leads to cell shrinkage, alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential, and DNA degradation are not yet completely understood. Recently, the study of mitochondria and changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential have become a focus of apoptosis regulation. A loss of mitochondrial membrane potential has been shown to occur in a variety of apoptotic model systems (5Cossarizza A. Kalashnikova G. Grassilli E. Chiappelli F. Salvioli S. Capri M. Barbieri D.

The opening of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) 1The abbreviations used are: MPT, mitochondrial permability transition; PBFI, potassium-binding benzofuran isophthalate; PI, propidium iodide; MMP, mitochondrial membrane potential; PMP, plasma membrane potential. pores, located on the inner mitochondrial membrane, is thought to underlie the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (8Zamzami N.

Mignotte B. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Activation of these MPT pores permits the redistribution of molecules across the inner mitochondrial membrane, thus disrupting the membrane potential of this organelle (10Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 11Zoratti M. Szabo I. J. Bioenerg.

Induction of the MPT has been suggested to result in the release of several apoptotic factors, including apoptotic proteases (apoptotic-inducing factor; Ref. 13Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M.

Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4463) Google Scholar). Other experimental observations suggest that disruption of electron transport, oxidative phosphorylation, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), as well as the generation of reactive oxygen species are thought to play an important roles in apoptosis (15Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

Science. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). Currently, however, the exact role that the MPT plays during apoptosis is not apparent and its relationship to other apoptotic events has not been clearly defined. Along with changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential, expression of a number of genes has also been reported to be pivotal in apoptosis. Studies in Caenorhabditis elegans have shown that the cysteine protease Ced-3 is essential for programmed cell death (18Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1986; 44: 817-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Sequence similarity between Ced-3 and the human interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (19Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar) led to the identification of a family of interleukin-1β-converting enzyme-related cysteine proteases that become activated during apoptosis. These proteases, collectively known as caspases, have been shown to play a critical role in apoptosis (20Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Caspases are synthesized as inactive proenzymes, which are activated following cleavage at specific aspartate residues, to become mature active enzymes. Interestingly, many of the pro-caspase cleavage sites are also caspase recognition sites (21Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4132) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that some caspases sequentially activate others, thus establishing a hierarchy of caspase activation (22Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M.

This cascade-like activation of activator and effector caspases permits the amplification of the proteolytic cleavage process during apoptosis only if the normal intracellular K+ levels are reduced (25Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 26Hughes Jr., F.M. Bortner C.D. Purdy G.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30567-30576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Currently the precise mechanism by which these proteases contribute to the classical apoptotic characteristics are still being elucidated. A fundamental characteristic of apoptosis that occurs in all model systems of programmed cell death is the loss of cell volume. We have previously shown that the loss of cell volume correlates with the population of cells which have degraded DNA (25Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 27Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C950-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, we have determined that cell shrinkage is associated with a dramatic decrease in intracellular ion concentration, particularly potassium, and that the ionic environment within cells can affect both the activation and activity of apoptotic enzymes (25Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 26Hughes Jr., F.M. Bortner C.D. Purdy G.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30567-30576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). We have now evaluated the relationship between cell shrinkage and loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential during apoptosis and examined the role of caspases in the regulation of cell volume loss, the ion efflux, and alterations in the mitochondrial membrane potential. We show that when the death response is activated through different apoptotic signaling pathways, cell shrinkage, K+ efflux, and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential are tightly linked, but all three can occur independently of both caspase activation and DNA degradation. Jurkat cells (human lymphoma) were cultured in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, 31 mg/liter penicillin, and 50 mg/liter streptomycin at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere. Jurkat cells (4 × 105 cells/ml) were initially treated with 10 ng/ml anti-human Fas IgM (Kamiya Biomedical) for 4, 8, and 12 h. In latter studies, Jurkat cells were treated with either 10 ng/ml anti-human Fas IgM, 1 μm A23187 (Calbiochem), or 7.5 μm thapsigargin (Sigma) for 24 h to achieve a similar amount of loss of membrane integrity, in the presence or absence of 25 μm of the various caspase inhibitors (z-VAD-fmk, DEVD-fmk, and IETD-fmk; Kamiya Biomedical) unless indicated otherwise. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Cell size and changes in the light scattering properties of the cells were determined by flow cytometry as described previously using a Becton Dickinson FACSort equipped with CellQuest software (27Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C950-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For each sample, 10,000 cells were examined by exciting the cells with a 488 nm argon laser and determining their position on a forward scatter versus side scatter dot plot. Light scattered in the forward direction is roughly proportional to cell size, while light scattered at a 90oangle (side scatter) is proportional to cell density (28Willman C.L. Stewart C.C. Semin. Diagnostic Pathol. 1989; 6: 3-12PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, as a cell shrinks or loses cell volume, a decrease in the amount of forward scattered light is observed, along with a slight change in side scattered light. A gate based on the properties of the control cells was set on each forward scatter versus side scatter dot plot to separate the normal and apoptotic populations of cells, and remained constant throughout the analysis. The percent of apoptotic cells was determined by statistical analysis of the dot plots using CellQuest software. The data was converted to three-dimensional plots for presentation. Intracellular potassium concentrations were determined as described previously using a Becton Dickinson FACSVantage (25Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Briefly, Jurkat cells treated in the presence or absence of various apoptotic agents and caspase inhibitors were loaded with the potassium-sensitive fluorescent dye potassium-binding benzofuran isophthalate (PBFI-AM; Molecular Probes) to a final dye concentration of 5 μm for 1 h at 37 °C, 7% CO2atmosphere prior to examination. Immediately prior to flow cytometric analysis, propidium iodide (PI, Sigma) was added to each sample to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Ten thousand cells were analyzed by sequential excitation of the cells containing PBFI-AM and PI at 340–350 and 488 nm, respectively. Gates were set on a PBFI (K+) versus PI dot plot to individually examine cells which had a reduced potassium concentration. Cells which were PI positive, indicating a loss of membrane integrity, were excluded from ion analysis. The data were converted to three-dimensional plots using CellQuest software for presentation. Changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential were measured by flow cytometry using JC-1 (Molecular Probes). Thirty minutes prior to cytometric analysis, JC-1 was added to 1-ml of cells to a final concentration of 10 μm and incubated at 37 °C, 7% CO2atmosphere. At the designated time, 10,000 cells were examined for each sample on a FL-1 (530 nm) versus FL-2 (585 nm) dot plot on a Becton Dickinson FACSort. JC-1 has dual emission depending on the state of the mitochondrial membrane potential. JC-1 forms aggregates in cells with a high FL-2 fluorescence indicating a normal mitochondrial membrane potential. Loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential results in a reduction in FL-2 fluorescence with a concurrent gain in FL-1 fluorescence as the dye shifts from an aggregate to monomeric state. Therefore, retention of the dye in the cell can be monitored through the increase in FL-1 fluorescence. The data were converted to density plots using CellQuest software for presentation. The DNA content for each sample was determined as described previously (27Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C950-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 ml of cells were pelleted from the culture medium and fixed by the slow addition of cold 70% ethanol to a volume of approximately 1.5-ml. The volume of each sample was adjusted to 5-ml with cold 70% ethanol, and the cells were stored at 4 °C overnight. For flow analysis, the fixed cells were pelleted, washed once in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline and stained in 1 ml of 20 μg/ml of PI, 1 mg/ml RNase in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min. Seven thousand five hundred cells were examined by flow cytometry by gating on an areaversus width dot plot to exclude cell debris and cell aggregates. The percent of degraded DNA was determined by the number of cells with subdiploid DNA divided by the total number of cells examined under each experimental condition. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that DNA degradation and loss of intracellular potassium (K+) occurs only in the shrunken apoptotic cells (25Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 27Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C950-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have now kinetically analyzed the relationship between K+ efflux and the loss of cell volume during apoptosis in Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas. As shown in Fig. 1A, forward scatterversus side scatter three-dimensional plots showed an increase in the number of cells which lose cell volume, which occurred in a time-dependent manner. Cells which have a decrease in cell volume have a reduced ability to scatter light in the forward direction. Furthermore, these apoptotic cells also showed a slight increase in their ability to scatter light at a 90° angle, indicating a concurrent increase in cellular density. We next analyzed these cells for the loss of intracellular K+ at the single cell level by flow cytometry utilizing the fluorescent potassium indicator dye PBFI-AM and propidium iodide to eliminate cells which loss their membrane integrity. The loss of intracellular potassium, as determined by a decrease in PBFI (K+) fluorescence in the viable shrunken population of anti-Fas-treated Jurkat cells, was also observed in a time-dependent manner with similar kinetics (Fig. 1A). To explore the relationship between cell shrinkage and the decrease in K+ concentration, we evaluated the K+ concentration in the population of shrunken and non-shrunken cells obtained from the kinetic study shown in Fig. 1A. Fig. 1B shows that cells which fail to shrink show no reduction in intracellular K+ concentration. In contrast, only shrunken cells had a decrease in intracellular K+ concentration, indicating that decreased K+concentration and cell shrinkage are tightly coupled events in apoptosis. Since the loss of cell volume is a fundamental characteristic of apoptosis, we next determined if other features of apoptosis were restricted to the shrunken population of cells. Recently, several laboratories have suggested that nuclear features of apoptosis are preceded by alterations in mitochondrial structure and transmembrane potential (5Cossarizza A. Kalashnikova G.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The fluorescent probe JC-1 has been shown to be most specific for measuring changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (35Cossarizza A. Baccarani-Contri M. Kalashnikova G. Franceschi C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), and was used for our analysis of the MMP. JC-1 forms either J-aggregates or monomers, depending on the state of the mitochondrial membrane potential, with the emissions of the two dye forms detectable by flow cytometry at 585 or 530 nm, respectively (35Cossarizza A. Baccarani-Contri M. Kalashnikova G. Franceschi C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). The high mitochondrial membrane potential of normal cells loaded with JC-1 allows for the formation of J-aggregates, detected by a peak in fluorescence at 585 nm. As the mitochondrial membrane potential is loss, these aggregates dissipate into monomers, which are detected as a shift in fluorescence from 585 to 530 nm. We initially examined JC-1 along with DiOC6 (Molecular Probes) for their ability to detect acute changes in both the MMP and plasma membrane potential (PMP). As shown in Fig. 2, JC-1 responds only to an acute uncoupling of the MMP using CCCP (Sigma). In contrast, DiOC6 responds to both acute changes in the MMP and PMP. These data suggest that JC-1 measures only changes in the MMP whereas DiOC6 measures both MMP and PMP. This observation cautions against the use of DiOC6 to specifically examine mitochondrial events. Fig. 3A shows the time-dependent loss of the MMP in anti-Fas-treated Jurkat cells, as the population of cells shifts to a lower JC-1 aggregate state and a concurrent higher JC-1 monomer state. To determine the relationship between the loss of cell volume and changes in the MMP, we compared the response of the mitochondrial dye JC-1 to changes in cell size which occur during apoptosis by flow cytometry. Examination of each individual JC-1 state (J-aggregate and monomeric)versus cell size in control and anti-Fas-treated Jurkat cells showed that only the shrunken population of cells had a decrease in JC-1 aggregates and an increase in JC-1 monomers (Fig. 3A). The increase in JC-1 monomeric fluorescence with this dye suggests that the loss of JC-1 aggregate fluorescence is not due to an overall loss of this dye from the cell. Similar results were observed in A23187 and thapsigargin-treated Jurkat cells (Fig. 3B). Therefore, the loss of cell volume and MMP in apoptotic cells appears to be tightly coupled and is independent of the mechanism used to signal cell death. We next examined the role that caspase activity plays in the generation of several apoptotic features by using various caspase inhibitors which are known to block both activator and effector caspases. We examined cells after 24 h of apoptotic treatment to ensure complete activation of the cell death program. Since DNA degradation has been a persistent characteristic of apoptosis and is thought to occur downstream of caspase activation during cell death, we utilized this apoptotic end point to evaluate the effectiveness of our caspase inhibitors. Jurkat cells treated with an anti-Fas antibody, A23187, or thapsigargin showed all of the classical characteristics of apoptosis, including DNA degradation, as determined by an increase in the number of cells with a subdiploid peak of DNA by flow cytometry (Fig. 4). z-VAD, a cell-permeable, broad spectrum inhibitor of caspase activity, has previously been shown to prevent apoptotic death in a number of apoptotic model systems by inhibiting both early and late proteases (reviewed in Ref. 8Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Zanin C. Vayssiere J.-L. Petit P.X. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). When Jurkat cells were treated with various apoptotic agents for 24 h, the presence of 25 μm z-VAD completely inhibited DNA degradation (Fig. 4, top). Similar results were observed when either 25 μm DEVD (a caspase-3 inhibitor) or IETD (a caspase-8 inhibitor) were used (Fig. 4, middle and bottom), indicating that the concentration of caspase inhibitors used in these experiments were effective in preventing a late apoptotic event. Having determined the efficacy of the caspase inhibitors in this model system, we next examined the effects of these various caspase inhibitors on their ability to prevent the loss of cell viability. In the absence of caspase inhibition, a significant increase in trypan blue positive cells was observed following a 24-h treatment of Jurkat cells with anti-Fas, A23187, or thapsigargin (Fig. 5). z-VAD was effective in preventing the loss of cell viability in the anti-Fas-treated cells (Fig. 5, top). However, z-VAD was only marginally effective in preventing the loss of cell viability in cells treated with A23187, and was decidedly ineffective in cells treated with thapsigargin (Fig. 5, top). Interestingly, the loss of cell viability occurred in the absence of DNA degradation (see Fig. 4), suggesting that membrane permeability changes, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion, can occur independent of DNA degradation and in a caspase-independent manner. Similarly, DEVD and IETD significantly blocked the loss of cell viability in the anti-Fas-treated cells. However, these inhibitors were ineffective where apoptosis was induced using a non-Fas signaling pathway (Fig. 5, middle and bottom). Thus although all caspase inhibition was effective in preventing DNA degradation under each apoptotic condition, the caspase inhibitors employed only blocked the loss of cell viability induced via Fas-receptor signaling. Higher concentration of the caspase inhibitors (100 μm) were similarly ineffective in preventing the loss of cell viability except when anti-Fas antibodies were the death signal (data not shown). These data show that the characteristics of apoptosis can be separated from caspases activity and cell death appears to be linked to activation of the death signaling process. We have previously shown that only the shrunken population of apoptotic cells contain degraded DNA (25Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar,27Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C950-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since caspase inhibition prevented DNA degradation in response to numerous apoptotic stimuli, we wished to determine if cell shrinkage was caspase dependent. We thus examined the loss of cell volume in Jurkat cells treated with various apoptotic agents in the presence or absence of caspase inhibitors. Jurkat cells activated to undergo apoptosis with anti-Fas, A23187, or thapsigargin in the absence of caspase inhibition showed a significant reduction in cell size (Fig. 6, top row). In the presence of 25 μm z-VAD, anti-Fas-treated Jurkat cells did not show a change in cell size, suggesting the dependence of caspase activity for cell shrinkage under this apoptotic condition, consistent with the data on cell viability. In contrast, z-VAD only marginally prevented the alterations in cell size in Jurkat cells treated with either A23187 or thapsigargin (Fig. 6, second row). Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas in the presence of either 25 μm DEVD or IETD also had a significant effect on preventing the changes in cell size, such that cell shrinkage was reduced by 50 and 70%, respectively (Fig. 6, second column).

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that calcineurin, a calcium-regulated phosphatase recently implicated in the signaling of some forms of cardiomyopathic growth, is required to induce skeletal muscle hypertrophy and muscle fiber type conversions associated with functional overload in vivo. Administration of the specific calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin (CsA) or FK506 to mice, for which the fast plantaris muscle was overloaded for 1–4 weeks, prevented the rapid doubling of mass and individual fiber size and the 4–20-fold increase in the number of slow fibers that characterize this condition. CsA treatment influenced the expression of muscle myofibrillar protein genes in a way reflective of fiber phenotype transformations but only in the long term of the overload condition, suggesting that the control of this growth response by calcineurin is not limited to the transcriptional activation of these muscle-specific genes. Clinically, these results provide insight to the post-surgical muscle wasting and weakness observed in recovering transplant recipients administered therapeutic dosages of these immunosuppressants.

To date, the molecular events linking muscle usage to the cellular expression and accumulation of these proteins are unknown. Recently, calcineurin, a cytoplasmic calcium-regulated phosphatase implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (2Molkentin J.D. Lu J.-R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J.

Colbert M.C. Gualberto A. Wieczorek D.F. Molkentin J.D.

Calcineurin is an enticing prospect as a regulatory enzyme in this signaling because its selective activation of NF-AT (nuclear factor ofactivated T cells) transcription factors in response to sustained increases in intracellular calcium concentrations (5Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar) is reminiscent of calcium fluctuations provoked by the activation of muscle cells during extensive contractile work (4Chin E.

Physiol. 1995; 269: C690-C697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Typically, a fast weight-bearing muscle subjected to the functional loss of its synergists will compensate by displaying within 2–4 weeks a doubling of mass and individual fiber sizes and an increase in strength (7Dunn S.E. Michel R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C371-C383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Olha A.E. Jasmin B.J. Michel R.N. Gardiner P.F. J. Neurophysiol. 1988; 60: 2138-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A muscle overloaded in this manner will also contract more slowly as a result of rapid fiber type transformations characterized by an increase in the number of fibers exhibiting slower, more energy-efficient contractile and calcium-handling proteins (7Dunn S.E. Michel R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C371-C383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Olha A.E. Jasmin B.J. Michel R.N. Gardiner P.F. J.

In rodent fast muscle, the myosin heavy chain (MHC) 1The abbreviations used are: MHC, myosin heavy chain; CsA, cyclosporin A; OV, overloaded; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); TnIs, slow troponin I; TnIf, fast troponin I.1The abbreviations used are: MHC, myosin heavy chain; CsA, cyclosporin A; OV, overloaded; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); TnIs, slow troponin I; TnIf, fast troponin I. enzyme component of the major contractile protein myosin displays a conversion pattern in response to overload that follows from the fastest to the slowest isoform in the order MHC IIb → IIx → IIa → I/slow. The signaling of these adaptations may well be mediated by calcineurin since most of the functional indices of overloaded muscles (8Olha A.E. Jasmin B.J. Michel R.N. Gardiner P.F. J. Neurophysiol. 1988; 60: 2138-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) suggest that fiber intracellular calcium levels are chronically elevated in these tissues. We thus tested the hypothesis that administration of CsA or FK506, both specific inhibitors of calcineurin (10Clipstone N.A. Fiorentino D.F. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26431-26437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to adult mice, for which the fast plantaris hind limb muscle was subjected to compensatory functional overload, would prevent the ensuing hypertrophy and MHC-type conversions that characterize this model. Preliminary results have appeared in abstract form (11Dunn S.E. Burns J.L. Michel R.N. FASEB J. 1999; 13: A84Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAs expected, overloaded mice administered vehicle displayed an increase (90–110%) in mean plantaris mass after 2–4 weeks of this condition compared with Sham-operated counterparts (Fig. 1a). This increase in muscle mass in response to overload corresponded to a progressive increase (55–130%) in the mean cross-sectional size of all plantaris MHC-typed fibers over 4 weeks of this treatment (Fig. 1, b and c). Although mean plantaris mass of overloaded mice administered CsA was higher (90%) at 2 weeks, the mean muscle mass of overloaded counterparts administered FK506 was not different from Sham-veh at 2- and 4-week time points (Fig. 1a). Similarly consistent with this drug effect, CsA treatment significantly counteracted the overload-associated increase in mean muscle mass over 4 weeks of this condition (Fig. 1a). More importantly, mean cross-sectional size across all MHC-typed fibers in both OV-CsA- or OV-FK506-treated tissues was not different from controls at either 2 or 4 weeks post-surgery (Fig. 1, b and c), clearly demonstrating the inability of these cells to hypertrophy in the presence of these calcineurin inhibitors despite the increased functional demands imposed by the overload condition. The histological appearance of plantaris fibers was normal at all post-treatment time points. Taken in this light, the increase in mean plantaris whole muscle mass observed in OV-CsA mice at 2 weeks is consistent with the notion that these muscles would be most susceptible to work-related extrafiber phenomena (i.e. interstitial edema) sustained as a result of their inability to adapt to the overload condition at the single-fiber level. The fact that this extrafiber response was tempered in OV-FK506 animals may relate to the relatively higher potency of this drug as an anti-inflammatory agent over its CsA counterpart (18Thompson A.W. Immunol. Today. 1989; 10: 6-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The absence of muscle hypertrophy in overloaded mice administered calcineurin inhibitors was not related to the effects of injection of these drugs alone (Fig. 1, a, b, and c; but see Fig. 1 legend) or to OV-CsA and OV-FK506 animals demonstrating less daily locomotor activity compared with vehicle-injected counterparts (see “Experimental Procedures”). Moreover, the effects of overload and CsA administration were not species-specific since muscle fiber hypertrophy was also prevented in adult rats under similar conditions. 2S. E. Dunn, J. L. Burns, and R. N. Michel, unpublished observations.To determine whether the prevention of hypertrophy by CsA and FK506 was related to immunophilin inactivation, we administered rapamycin to a separate group of overloaded mice (n = 3). Rapamycin is an immunosuppressant drug that complexes with an FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) but does not target calcineurin (19Sehgal S.N. Ther. Drug Monitor. 1995; 17: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Similar to the effects of OV-veh and in contrast to those of FK506, administration of rapamycin to OV mice resulted in a significant increase (37–49%) in size of plantaris fibers expressing MHC IIa (860 ± 28versus 578 ± 45) and IIx (1267 ± 65versus 924 ± 54) above Sham-veh levels after 2 weeks of this condition, emphasizing that the prevention of hypertrophy in these cell types at this time was likely mediated via calcineurin inhibition. On the other hand, rapamycin did prevent hypertrophy of fibers expressing I MHC (564 ± 32 versus 559 ± 50), a finding that is hard to reconcile but may relate to the fact that rapamycin-FKBP complexes also interfere with mRNA translation via mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), an important signaling intermediate for cellular protein turnover (20Dennis P.B. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The finding that rapamycin may have other as yet undetermined effects in vivois further supported by the observation that OV-rapamycin tissues were extensively degenerative, displaying a distinct and considerable reappearance of small (<350 μm2) de novofibers that decorated with embryonic MHC compared with FK506 or CsA counterparts (data not shown).The rapid muscle fiber growth associated with functional overload has been attributed in part to the proliferation of satellite cells and subsequent fusion of their progeny with pre-existing muscle fibers (15Phelan J.N. Gonyea W.J. Anat. Rec. 1997; 247: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The recent findings that CsA administration prevents the differentiation and fusion of myoblasts in vitro and hinders muscle regeneration in response to injury in vivo (21Abbott K.L. Friday B.B. Thaloor D. Murphy T.J. Pavlath G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2905-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) raised the possibility that the prevention of hypertrophy in adult OV-CsA-treated muscles is related to an inhibition of satellite cell differentiation under these conditions. To address this, we tested for the presence of fibers expressing embryonic MHC and displaying centrally located nuclei, both hallmarks of muscle regeneration (21Abbott K.L. Friday B.B. Thaloor D. Murphy T.J. Pavlath G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2905-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), within excised tissue sections after 1–2 weeks of OV-veh and OV-CsA treatments. We detected a comparable number of regenerating fibers after both conditions mainly within remnant portions of the ablated gastrocnemius (data not shown). We also assessed the extent of satellite cell proliferation within OV-veh and OV-CsA plantaris tissues using the thymidine analog BrdUrd and found it to be minimal, suggesting that proliferation of satellite cells is not a major contributor to the rapid growth of pre-existing plantaris fibers in response to overload (data not shown). Taken together, these findings suggest that the prevention of hypertrophy in OV-CsA-treated tissues cannot be ascribed in any major way to mechanisms involving inhibition of satellite cell differentiation or muscle fiber regeneration by CsA.Also consistent with our hypothesis, fiber conversions that occur in response to functional overload (7Dunn S.E. Michel R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C371-C383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were also prevented by the administration of these specific calcineurin inhibitors. Immunolabeling of plantaris cross-sections with a slow/type I MHC-specific antibody showed that overload induced a quadrupling of the number of fibers expressing this protein after 2 weeks, which progressed to a 20-fold increase in this number by 4 weeks (Fig. 2). These gains in the proportion of fibers expressing I MHC over the 4-week period were at the major expense of pre-existing mature fibers expressing fast MHC isoforms and not the result of a significant generation of new fibers (data not shown; see Ref. 7Dunn S.E. Michel R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C371-C383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These extensive MHC fast/type II → slow/type I fiber transformations did not occur in overloaded mice administered CsA (Fig. 2, c and e). Additionally, immunolabeling of the fast IIa, IIx, and IIb MHCs in serial cross-sections showed that OV mice administered vehicle displayed the IIb → IIx → IIa MHC conversions typical of this condition, whereas these transformations were prevented in CsA-injected counterparts (data not shown). In this respect, our findings in vivo not only support the recent contention that calcineurin may influence the expression of slow contractile proteins in vitro (4Chin E. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) but further these observations by showing that this enzyme also plays a critical role in the expression of fast MHC counterparts during transitions within the fast fiber population itself (i.e. MHC IIb → IIx or IIx → IIa) in response to chronic increases in muscle usage.Figure 2Administration of calcineurin inhibitors prevents the fast-to-slow fiber conversions associated with overload. Plantaris muscle cross-sections displaying individual fibers labeled (brown) with a type I/slow MHC-specific antibody. Chronic overload induced a progressive increase in the size of all fibers as well as the number of fibers decorated by MHC I antibody after 2 (panel b, slow no. = 24 ± 6) and 4 (panel d, slow no. = 110 ± 32) weeks compared with Sham-operated counterparts (panel a, slow no. = 6 ± 2). Treatment of overloaded mice with CsA effectively counteracted this adaptive response to overload at both 2 (panel c) and 4 (panel e) weeks. Scale bar = 100 μm for panels a,b, and c. Scale bar = 200 μm for panels d and e.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Recent studies provide evidence that calcineurin-NF-AT signaling may mediate hypertrophy in cardiac muscle and fast-to-slow phenotypic adaptations in skeletal muscles in vitro, in part, via the transcriptional activation of a subset of slow muscle-specific genes (2Molkentin J.D. Lu J.-R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar, 3Sussman M.A. Lim H.W.

This is particularly true of the slow isoform of troponin I which harbors distinct consensus elements for NF-AT in its promoter (22Nakayama M. Stauffer J. Cheng J. Banerjee-Basu S. Wawrousek E. Buonanno A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2408-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Indeed, calcineurin-mediated transcriptional activation of slow fiber genes such as TnIs and associated reciprocal repression of its fast fiber counterpart TnIf by NF-AT factors has been proposed as a model to explain fast-to-slow fiber conversions in skeletal muscle in response to chronic increases in muscle activation (4Chin E. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). In light of this, we examined whether the prevention of overload-induced hypertrophy and fiber transitions by calcineurin inhibition were related to changes in the expression of TnI and MHC genes. To this end we used a semiquantitative RT-PCR assay to assess TnI and MHC transcript levels relative to total RNA in treated tissues.For the most part, overload-induced changes in TnI and MHC transcript levels were more reflective of fast-to-slow fiber conversions than the hypertrophic growth observed across all plantaris cell types. Specifically, we observed increases in TnIs mRNA and reciprocal decreases in TnIf mRNA after 1 (data not shown), 2 (Fig. 3), and 4 (Fig. 4) weeks of overload that were in line with predictions based on the fiber-type transformations associated with this model. A similar reciprocal change in mRNA levels was observed for MHC I and IIb, but only after 4 weeks of overload, suggesting a discoordinate modulation of the expression of specific myofibrillar genes during the course of this condition. In this sense, our data are consistent with those of others using this same model (23Crerar M.M. Hamilton N.C. Blank S. Urdea M.S. Ianuzzo C.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 86: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and suggest that the cellular expression and accumulation of key myofibrillar proteins in the early stages of overload may be mediated, in large part, by post-transcriptional events.Figure 3Transcript levels for MHC and TnI isoforms after 2 weeks of overload-vehicle and overload-CsA treatments.

Surprisingly, in the short term, the combination of CsA and overload triggered a large accumulation of TnIs mRNA after 1 (data not shown) and 2 weeks of this condition (Fig. 3), rather than the anticipated down-regulation of this gene in the presence of this calcineurin inhibitor (4Chin E. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Moreover, CsA administration to overloaded mice did not appear to influence the expression of MHC mRNAs in the short term of this treatment in any way predicted by the protein adaptations observed at this time (Fig. 3). Our data therefore suggest that the influence of calcineurin-NF-AT signaling on the expression of fast and slow isoforms of distinct myofibrillar proteins, including TnIs, in intact animals is more complex than what is proposed to occurin vitro (4Chin E. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) and is not limited to the transcriptional activation of these contractile protein genes.Our results are the first to show that calcineurin has a profound influence on the accumulation of skeletal muscle contractile proteins under conditions of increased activation. In this sense, the actions of calcineurin in skeletal muscle resemble those recently purported to mediate various forms of hypertrophic cardiac myopathy (2Molkentin J.D. Lu J.-R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar, 3Sussman M.A. Lim H.W. Gude N. Taigen T.

The etiology of these cardiomyopathies is proposed to involve alterations in the cellular handling of calcium (2Molkentin J.D. Lu J.-R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar, 3Sussman M.A. Lim H.W. Gude N. Taigen T. Olson E.N. Robbins J. Colbert M.C. Gualberto A. Wieczorek D.F. Molkentin J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), leading to higher sustained intracellular levels of this cation, a condition necessary for calcineurin activation (5Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). CsA and FK506 can only interfere with the action of calcineurin when this enzyme is in its activated configuration (10Clipstone N.A. Fiorentino D.F. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26431-26437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In light of this, our finding that CsA and FK506 prevented the growth of all MHC-typed fibers, but only during overload, suggests that signaling via calcineurin in skeletal muscle fibers is initiated only when the nerve-mediated frequency of calcium oscillations (5Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar) becomes higher (i.e. more sustained calcium levels), relative to levels intrinsic to each cell type under normal contractile loading conditions. In this respect, our findings corroborate reports of a lack of change in the size and phenotype of skeletal muscle in normal weight-bearing rats administered lower dosages of CsA (24Biring M.S. Fournier M. Ross D.J. Lewis M.I. J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 84: 1967-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This apparent dependence of calcineurin signaling on relative increases in muscle activation characteristics may also explain why transplant recipients administered therapeutic dosages of this immunosuppressant during their recovery from surgery are unable to regain losses in skeletal muscle mass and strength related to pre- and post-surgical bed rest (25Goy J.-J. Stauffer J.-C. Deruaz J.-P. Gillard D. Kaufmann U. Kuntzer T. Kappenberger L. Lancet. 1989; i: 1446-1447Abstract Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Although the downstream molecular actions of calcineurin in the control of skeletal muscle growth and fiber conversion are not known, our results suggest that they are not limited to the transcriptional activation of contractile protein genes via NF-AT dephosphorylation or to an inhibition of satellite cell differentiation. The effects of calcineurin on the expression of skeletal myofibrillar proteins may be mediated by direct or indirect mechanisms. For instance, calcineurin is known to directly dephosphorylate specific muscle cytoskeletal proteins and to interact with other phosphatase signaling pathways via its dephosphorylation of inhibitor-1 (26Guerini D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 271-275Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Future studies will be needed to address the mechanism by which calcineurin exerts its control over skeletal muscle fiber growth and type conversions. Nonetheless, our present finding of a role for this enzyme in the adaptations of this tissue to increased usage is important and should provide insight to the development of counteraction strategies for the muscle wasting and loss of function associated with a wide range of neuromuscular diseases. The amount and type of contractile proteins incorporated into the myofibrils of skeletal muscle fibers are major determinants of the size, strength, and speed of these cells (1Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). To date, the molecular events linking muscle usage to the cellular expression and accumulation of these proteins are unknown.

Calcineurin is an enticing prospect as a regulatory enzyme in this signaling because its selective activation of NF-AT (nuclear factor ofactivated T cells) transcription factors in response to sustained increases in intracellular calcium concentrations (5Dolmetsch R.E.

On a single channel level, BIDΔ1–55 channels were voltage-gated and exhibited multiconductance behavior at neutral pH.

The Bcl-2 protein family can be divided into two camps: pro- and anti-apoptotic, with proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL acting to prevent cell death and proteins such as Bax and Bak encouraging cell death. The sequences of these proteins share pockets of similarity in regions designated BH1–4. 1The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology domain; DOPC, 1,2-dioleoylphosphatidylcholine; DOPG, 1,2-dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; S, siemens; Casp, caspase; Cyt c , cytochrome c ; POPE, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine; POPG, 1-pamitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-rac-glycerol1The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology domain; DOPC, 1,2-dioleoylphosphatidylcholine; DOPG, 1,2-dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; S, siemens; Casp, caspase; Cyt c , cytochrome c ; POPE, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine; POPG, 1-pamitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-rac-glycerol The three-dimensional structure of Bcl-XL shows the protein to be a bundle of seven α-helices with two central predominantly hydrophobic helices forming the core of the molecule. This structure is reminiscent of pore-forming bacterial toxins diphtheria and colicins A, E1, and Ia, suggesting that Bcl-XL may have channel-forming potential (1Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadow R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.L. Ng S.L. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). Indeed, in vitro channel-forming activity was demonstrated for Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, and Bax (2Minn A.J. Velez P. Schendel S.L. Liang H. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Nature. 1997; 385: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 3Schendel S.L. Xie Z. Montal M.O. Matsuyama S. Montal M. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gambale F. Sadoul R. Martinou J.C. Science. 1997; 277: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Predicted structures for Bcl-2 and Bax can be modeled using the coordinates of Bcl-XL, suggesting that these proteins share similar structural features (5Schendel S.L. Montal M. Reed J.C. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of one branch of the Bcl-2 family diverge substantially from Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, Bax, and many other Bcl-2 family proteins, sharing similarity only within the ∼16 amino acid BH3 domain. This “BH3-only” subset includes BID, BAD, BIK, and HRK (reviewed in Ref. 6Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (4754) Google Scholar), which are all pro-apoptotic proteins. These proteins are presently thought to lack intrinsic activity, acting as trans-dominant inhibitors by use of their BH3 domains to interact with the BH3-binding pockets of anti-apoptotic proteins (7Kelekar A. Thompson C.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). In this view, BH3 proteins may play a passive role in apoptosis promotion by displacing anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-XL from interactions with Bax, Apaf-1, or other pro-apoptotic proteins, freeing them to exert pro-apoptotic activities. Mitochondria also play significant roles in apoptosis (reviewed in Ref.8Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl-2 family members possessing a hydrophobic COOH-terminal membrane anchoring domain (e.g. Bcl-2, Bcl-XL) typically localize to mitochondrial membranes (reviewed in Refs. 6Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (4754) Google Scholar and 8Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although some members such as Bax can be transient mitochondrial residents that translocate from the cytosol to the mitochondria in response to several death signals (9Wolter J.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Zi X.G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar, 10Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Escape of cytochromec (Cyt c) from mitochondria represents a critical event in initiating the caspase activation cascade, through its interaction with Apaf-1, which induces processing and activation of the cell death protease caspase-9 (Casp-9) (11Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar, 12Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6156) Google Scholar). The portal through which Cyt c passes into the cytoplasm is unknown, although Bax and the mitochondrial permeability pore complex appear to play important roles in Cyt c release (13Jürgensmeier J.M.

In response to Fas receptor ligation, pro-Casp-8 is recruited to the death-receptor complex where local aggregation allows Casp-8 processing (15Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). This activation is followed by Cyt c release and subsequent activation of downstream caspases such as Casp-3, -6, and -7 (16Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14486-14491Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Recently, the participation of BID in Cyt c release from mitochondria in Fas-stimulated cells was demonstrated (17Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.-J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3755) Google Scholar,18Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar). BID is a 195-residue, 22-kDa protein that lacks the hydrophobic COOH-terminal domain often found in Bcl-2 family proteins and which has a predominantly cytosolic localization (19Wang K. Yin X.-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). BID interacts with Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bax via its BH3 domain and can counteract the cytoprotective effects of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (19Wang K. Yin X.-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). The murine BID amino acid sequence contains a putative Casp-8 cleavage site (57-l-Q-T-d-G-61) within its NH2terminus and BID is indeed cleaved between residues 59 and 60 by Casp-8 both in vivo and in vitro (17Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.-J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3755) Google Scholar, 18Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar). The intact BID protein is found in the cytoplasm, but upon cleavage, truncated BID translocates to mitochondria (17Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.-J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3755) Google Scholar, 18Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar). In vitro, truncated, but not intact BID, is a potent inducer of Cyt c release from isolated mitochondria, prompting release of more than 80% of total Cyt c after treatment with nanogram amounts of Casp-8-cleaved BID (18Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar). Thus, BID serves as a linker between the Fas receptor at the cytoplasmic membrane and the mitochondrial cell death machinery. The conversion from the cytosolic, soluble intact BID to the mitochondrial membrane-associated NH2-terminal truncated BID and subsequent Cyt c release implies that truncated BID may play a role in priming the mitochondrial membrane to become more per- meable, permitting Cyt c to escape. To explore this possibility, the membrane activity of both wild-type and truncated recombinant murine BID was examined using liposome and planar bilayer assays. A plasmid encoding a GST-BID fusion protein was constructed by liberating aEcoRI-XhoI cDNA encoding murine BID-(1–195) and subcloning into pGEX4Ti (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). BIDΔ1–55 was constructed after introduction of an EcoRI site between the codons for residues 55 and 56 using forward (5′-CTCGAAGACGAATTCCAGACAGAC-3′; altered base pairs underlined) and reverse (5′-CCGGGAGCTGCATGTGTCAGAGG-3′) primers in a polymerase chain reaction reaction to amplify a ∼0.5-kilobase pair fragment flanked by EcoRI-XhoI sites. Residue 55, rather than 59, was chosen to minimize the number of base pair changes necessary to introduce the EcoRI site. The fragment was then inserted into pGEX4Ti following EcoRI and XhoI digestion. The presence of the deletion was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Wild-type BID and BIDΔ1–55 were produced as GST fusion proteins from pGEX vectors usingEscherichia coli BL21 (DE3) as the host strain. The purification method is identical for each protein. An overnight culture (5 ml) was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB medium that was incubated at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.8–1.0 was achieved. The cells were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 4 h before harvesting by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, Complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and incubated on ice for 30 min before brief sonication to reduce viscosity. The resulting lysate was centrifuged at (8000 × g) for 15 min to pellet cellular debris. Three ml GST-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to the supernatant and incubated at 4 °C with gentle rotation for 3 h. The beads were washed twice with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm EDTA followed by two washings with the same buffer lacking Tween 20. The beads were resuspended in 10 ml of the final wash buffer and incubated with 10 units thrombin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 90 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected in fractions from the beads and passed over a benzamidine-agarose column (Sigma) to inactivate thrombin. For liposome and circular dichroism assays, the protein was dialyzed into 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Purified proteins were characterized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 15% high Tris gels (20Fling S.P Gregerson D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar), followed by Coomassie staining. Concentrations were determined either by A280 using ε = 0.5 and 0.1 for BID wild-type and BIDΔ1–55, respectively, or by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were carried out on an AVIV D60 spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature control accessory and calibrated with d-10-camphor sulfonate. Measurements were taken using a 1-mm path length. All spectra were recorded in 1.0-nm wavelength increments with a 1-s time constant and a full-scale sensitivity of 10 millidegrees. Each spectrum is the average of three scans corrected for background solvent effects by subtraction of the appropriate buffer blank. BID and BIDΔ1–55 in either 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, or 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, were diluted to a concentration of 0.3 and 0.1 mg/ml, respectively. Spectra were scanned in the far-UV from 250 to 190 nm. A value of 110 for the mean residue molecular weight was used in the calculation of the mean residue ellipticity (Θ). Large unilamellar vesicles composed of 70% dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and 30% dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) were produced as described previously (4Antonsson B. Contin F. Ciavatta A. Montessuit S. Lewis S. Martinou I. Bernasconi L. Bernard A. Mermod J.J. Mazzei G. Maundrell K. Gambale F. Sadoul R. Martinou J.C. Science. 1997; 277: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). The liposomes were diluted to a final concentration of 0.05 mg/ml in 10 mm dimethyl glutaric acid, 100 mm choline nitrate, 2 mmCa(NO3)2 at either pH 4.0 or pH 6.0. Valinomycin was added to a final concentration of 15 nm to generate an inside-negative potential. BID wild-type or BIDΔ1–55 was added at the indicated concentrations, and residual Cl−was released following addition of Triton X-100 (0.1% v:v). The total amount of Cl− released was compared against a calibration curve produced by successive additions of KCl. Electrode assembly is as described previously (4Antonsson B. Contin F. Ciavatta A. Montessuit S. Lewis S. Martinou I. Bernasconi L. Bernard A. Mermod J.J. Mazzei G. Maundrell K. Gambale F. Sadoul R. Martinou J.C. Science. 1997; 277: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Structure prediction for BID was attempted using a threading approach (21Jaroszewski L. Rychlewski L. Zhang B. Godzik A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1431-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The algorithm produced several possible predictions with similar significance scores. Out of the first four predictions, two were disqualified, because their sequence alignments failed to produce a three-dimensional model. The remaining predictions out of the first four were: apolipophorin III (PDB code 1aep, a four-helical bundle) and Bcl-XL (1maz). The 1aep prediction was discarded because removal of the NH2-terminal fragment up to Asp-59 (which is cleaved by caspase to produce an active protein) does not result in change of exposure of the BH3 domain in the model. The 1maz prediction was more consistent with experimental data, because removal of the NH2-terminal fragment from the model results in a substantial change of BH3 domain accessible surface. Two models of BID, either the full-length or Δ1–59 based on the Bcl-XLstructure were then built using the MODELLER program (22Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10290) Google Scholar). Phospholipid bilayer membranes were formed as described previously (23Mirzabekov T.A. Silberstein A.Y. Kagan B.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Solvent containing membranes were formed by placing a bubble of lipid onto the end of the Teflon tube approximately 300 microns in diameter. The design of the chamber allowed rapid introduction of solution into immediate proximity with the membrane in a volume of only 50 microliters. Agar salt bridges were used to connect the electrodes to the solutions and voltage clamp conditions were employed in all experiments. Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL) and stored at −70 °C. In some cases, azolectin was used for membranes to increase sensitivity but this was unnecessary for BID (Δ1–55). Current was recorded with an Axopatch amplifier (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA) and stored on videotape for later playback and analysis. Membrane capacitance and resistance were monitored in order to assure the formation of reproducible membranes. To explore the possibility that BID interacts with membranes, recombinant BID and BIDΔ1–55 were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli. BIDΔ1–55 represents a recombinant mimic of the ∼15-kDa Casp-8 cleavage product of BID and was used to avoid any ambiguities associated with incomplete digestion of full-length BID or the possible confounding presence of Casp-8. The BID proteins were liberated from the GST moiety by thrombin digestion and determined to be >90% purity, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis with Coomassie staining (Fig. 1). The faintness of the BIDΔ1–55 band may be attributable to its lack of aromatic amino acids (one tyrosine and no tryptophans) required for Coomassie Blue binding (24Congdon R.W. Muth G.W. Splittgerber A.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To assess whether the truncated form of BID possesses a significantly different structure, circular dichroism (CD) spectra were obtained for each protein. The far UV-CD spectrum (185–250 nm) is dominated by the amide bond absorption and is highly sensitive to the presence of ordered secondary structure. The far-UV spectrum for both wild-type and truncated forms of BID display minima at ∼202 and 222 nm and are characteristic of proteins having at least 50–60% α-helical secondary structure (25Johnson W.C. Proteins Struct. Func. Genet. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Little change was seen in the shape or amplitude of the far-UV spectrum between the wild-type and BIDΔ1–55, indicating that the α-helical nature of these two proteins remains intact despite the loss of the first 55 residues (Fig. 2). These CD data also demonstrate that BID and BIDΔ1–55 possess a high α-helical content. The high α-helical content of BID and BIDΔ1–55 is reminiscent of the channel-forming Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, and Bax proteins as well as structurally related bacterial toxins such as the pore-forming colicins and diphtheria toxin. When BID was added to KCl-loaded liposomes composed of 70% neutral (DOPC) and 30% acidic (DOPG), no chloride efflux could be observed, either at pH 4.0 or 7.0 (Fig. 3,curve c, and data not shown). In contrast, when BIDΔ1–55 was added in nanogram amounts to similar vesicles, the protein induced >50% release of encapsulated chloride at pH 4.0 (Fig. 3, curve a), but no ion release was detected at pH 7.0 (Fig. 3, curve d). The ion release induced by truncated BID displayed a partial dependence of an outside-positive voltage, as the amount of ion released in the absence of the K+-specific ionophore valinomycin was reduced (Fig. 3, curve b). No BIDΔ1–55-induced ion release was detected at pH 4.0 when the vesicles lacked acidic lipids (100% DOPC) (not shown). The behavior of BIDΔ1–55 closely resembles that observed previously for Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL in that the activity detected in this assay is pH and voltage-dependent and requires acidic lipids (2Minn A.J. Velez P. Schendel S.L. Liang H. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Nature. 1997; 385: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 3Schendel S.L. Xie Z. Montal M.O. Matsuyama S. Montal M. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 93: 5113-5118Crossref Scopus (545) Google Scholar). The chloride efflux assay detects channel activity on a macroscopic level and requires that the bulk of the protein molecules are participating in channel formation, excluding the possibility that a small subgroup of molecules are responsible for ion release. To characterize the behavior of wild-type and truncated BID at a microscopic level, experiments were performed using planar bilayer membranes. This technique allows channels to be monitored at the single channel level and yields more specific information on pH, voltage dependence, and ion conductance. When wild-type BID was added to planar bilayers at pH 7.3 in the presence of a +50 mV membrane potential, no channel activity was observed (Fig. 4A). Yet when the chamber was flushed out and a pH 4.0 buffer solution was added, channel activity began immediately (Fig. 4A, expanded region), suggesting that the wild-type BID is able to associate with the membrane, but an acidic pH is necessary to achieve membrane insertion and channel activity. This channel activity does not appear to require that the protein undergo significant changes in secondary structure as the far-UV CD spectrum of wild-type BID at pH 4.0 is indistinguishable from that at pH 7.0 (Fig. 2). However, the lack of a clear quantal size for these channels may reflect rapid transitions among multiple conformations of molecules undergoing tertiary structure changes as they interact with the membrane. Since BID is a Casp-8 target in vivo, we explored whether Casp-8-cleaved BID also displays channel activity similar to the mutant mimic BIDΔ1–55. Incubation of BID with Casp-8 at a 10:1 (mole:mole) ratio produced a cleaved form of BID (not shown) that exhibited channel activity within 1 min after addition of the cleavage mixture to planar bilayers at pH 7 (Fig. 4B). Similar to Casp-8-cleaved BID, BIDΔ1–55 also demonstrated channel activity at neutral pH (Fig. 4C). Our ability to detect channels formed by BID Δ1–55 at neutral pH in planar bilayers but not in liposome-based ion efflux assays presumably reflects the greater sensitivity of the former method. Similar results were also obtained for Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (2Minn A.J. Velez P. Schendel S.L. Liang H. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Nature. 1997; 385: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 3Schendel S.L. Xie Z. Montal M.O. Matsuyama S. Montal M. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 93: 5113-5118Crossref Scopus (545) Google Scholar). We used the BIDΔ1–55 protein as a recombinant mimic of Casp8-cleaved BID to further characterize BID channel activity in planar bilayers (Fig. 5). BIDΔ1–55 displayed a membrane potential dependence that was similar to that observed for the pore-forming colicins (26Cramer W.A. Heymann J.B. Schendel S.L. Deiry B.N. Cohen F.S. Elkins P.A. Stauffacher C.V. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and to that observed for truncated BID in liposomes, in that the channel was open when a positive voltage was applied on the side to which BID was added but converted to a nonconductive state when the voltage was reversed to a negative voltage. Several BIDΔ1–55 single channel conductances with clear quantal sizes were discerned in these experiments (Fig. 5), including smaller conductances of 7.4 pS and larger conductances of 40 and 100 pS in 150 mm KCl (Fig. 5). Although the sequence similarity between BID and Bcl-XL and other family members is confined to the BH3 domain, the high α-helical content of the protein and its ability to form ion channelsin vitro prompted the consideration that BID may share structural similarity with Bcl-XL or other pore-forming proteins. Accordingly, structure prediction for BID was attempted using a threading approach (21Jaroszewski L. Rychlewski L. Zhang B. Godzik A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1431-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), revealing extensive predicted structural similarity with Bcl-XL (Fig. 6). Using the MODELLER program, models for the full-length and truncated forms of BID were built using the Bcl-XL coordinates as a guide. The COOH-terminal portion of both BID and BIDΔ1–55 are predicted to correspond to the last six of the seven α-helices observed for the Bcl-XL structure. This includes a centrally located pair of hydrophobic α-helices previously implicated in pore formation by Bcl-2 and Bax (3Schendel S.L. Xie Z. Montal M.O. Matsuyama S. Montal M. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 93: 5113-5118Crossref Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 14Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jürgensmeier J.M. Susin S.A. Vieira H.L. Prevost M.C. Xie Z. Matsuyama S. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Science. 1998; 281: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar) and an α-helix corresponding to the BH3 dimerization domain (Fig. 6). The NH2-terminal region of full-length BID proximal to the caspase cleavage site does not model well on the Bcl-XLstructure, which corresponds to the BH4-containing first α-helix in Bcl-XL. In contrast to BID, attempts to model other BH3-only proteins on the Bcl-XL coordinates were unsuccessful, including BAD, Blk, Bik, Hrk, and Egl (not shown), thus suggesting that these members of the Bcl-2 family do not possess structures similar to Bcl-XL and related pore-forming proteins. Two observations related to the effects of cleavage of BID are predicted by comparisons of the models for full-length and truncated BID. First, removal of the NH2-terminal segment (1–55) results in a 60 Å2 increase of exposed hydrophobic surface area of the central pair of helices (α4-α5 in this model), which are candidate pore-forming regions of the protein. Consequently, removal of the NH2-terminal region by proteolysis may promote the association of the cleaved BID protein with membranes. Second, excising the NH2-terminal segment is predicted to result in increased accessibility of the BH3 dimerization domain by 90 Å2. Since the hydrophobic surface of BH3 domains is known to be involved in dimerization among Bcl-2 family proteins (27Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadow R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon M.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar), this suggests that cleavage of BID may also promote its heterodimerization with Bcl-2 family members (Fig. 6). Taken together, the findings presented here argue that while BID shares very limited amino acid sequence similarity with Bcl-XL and other documented pore-forming members of the Bcl-2 protein family, BID may nevertheless be a structurally similar protein that also shares pore-forming capability. Recent determination of the three-dimensional structure of BID, which was reported while this work was under review (28Chou J.J. Li H. Salvesen G.S. Yuan J. Wagner G. Cell. 1999; 96: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 29McDonnell J.M. Fushman D. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cowburn D. Cell. 1999; 96: 625-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), supports this view. The pore-forming activity of BID is unique in that it occurs primarily following proteolytic cleavage. Although full-length BID did display some channel activity on planar bilayers at acidic pH, this may reflect that the NH2terminus has become “unwrapped” from the protein at low pH in the same manner as previously documented for colicins (26Cramer W.A.

Thus, low pH may promote BID conformations that allow some of the uncleaved molecules to insert into membranes under conditions of nonphysiological pH. However, in vivo, where pH essentially never drops below pH 6.0, the NH2-terminal domain of BID presumably requires physical removal by Casp-8 cleavage, although other mechanisms involving interactions with other proteins cannot be excluded. Previously, BH3-only proteins have been viewed as trans-dominant inhibitors that relied exclusively on dimerization with other Bcl-2 family proteins to exert effects on cell life and death. The results presented here suggest that some BH3-only proteins may have intrinsic activities as membrane-integrating or channel proteins, necessitating re-evaluation of the role of this sub-branch of the Bcl-2 family.

https://openalex.org/W2030955600,"Defective cAMP-stimulated chloride conductance of the plasma membrane of epithelial cell is the hallmark of cystic fibrosis (CF) and results from mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, CFTR. In the majority of CF patients, mutations in the CFTR lead to its misfolding and premature degradation at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Other mutations impair the cAMP-dependent activation or the ion conductance of CFTR chloride channel. In the present work we identify a novel mechanism leading to reduced expression of CFTR at the cell surface, caused by C-terminal truncations. The phenotype of C-terminally truncated CFTR, representing naturally occurring premature termination and frameshift mutations, were examined in transient and stable heterologous expression systems. Whereas the biosynthesis, processing, and macroscopic chloride channel function of truncated CFTRs are essentially normal, the degradation rate of the mature, complex-glycosylated form is 5- to 6-fold faster than the wild type CFTR. These experiments suggest that the C terminus has a central role in maintaining the metabolic stability of the complex-glycosylated CFTR following its exit from the ER and provide a plausible explanation for the severe phenotype of CF patients harboring C-terminal truncations.

The CF gene product, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride selective ion channel, consists of two structurally homologous halves connected by the regulatory domain, wherein each half contains a transmembrane domain, comprising six transmembrane helices, and a nucleotide binding domain (NBD) (2Riordan J.R.

In contrast, the molecular phenotype of CFTR variants harboring mutations in the C-terminal tail has not been extensively investigated. Interestingly, patients with a premature stop codon or frameshift mutation that causes the deletion of the last 70–98 residues have severe CF with pancreatic insufficiency, recurrent lung infections, and elevated sweat chloride (Cystic Fibrosis Genetic Consortium Database, Toronto and footnote 2), suggesting that the C-terminal tail may play a role in the function of CFTR. In this study, we have examined the biochemical and functional characteristics of CFTR mutants caused by premature terminations. Although the C-terminal tail is not required for the biogenesis and macroscopic chloride channel function of CFTR, it appears indispensable for maintaining the stability of the complex-glycosylated CFTR. Therefore, our results highlight a previously unrecognized role of the C terminus and describe a novel mechanism of CF that is determined by the accelerated degradation of the mature, truncated CFTR. The following compound heterozygote patients were identified in the CF Genetic Consortium Database, with a ΔF508 mutation and a premature stop codon or frameshift mutation in the second allele. Frameshift mutations were as follows: 4326delTC (M. Goosens and J. Zielenski; Δ81, +0), 4279insA (A. Wallace; Δ97, +1), 4271delC (S. J. Shackleton; Δ101, +3). Premature stop codons were as follows: Q1412X (A. Wallace and M. Tassabehji; Δ70); S1455X and L1399X (Δ26 and Δ82, respectively). The communicating person, the number of residues deleted from the C terminus of CFTR, and the number of residues changed between the frameshift mutation and the premature stop codon are indicated. Premature stop codons were inserted by site-directed mutagenesis, using single-stranded pBluescript SKII-CFTR as the template (kindly provided by Dr. J. Rommens), by the method of Kunkel (15Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) to obtain CFTR lacking the last 26, 70, 82, and 98 amino acid residues. For T26 and T82 CFTR, the mutagenic primers (5′-CCC CAC CGG AAC TGA AGC AAG TGC-3′ and 5′-GCT GAT TCG ACA GTA ATT TGA CTC TGT GAA CAC AGG-3′ (ACGT Corp., Toronto) created TGA and TAG stop codons after nucleotides 4494 and 4326, respectively. To clone pCDNA3-T26 CFTR and pcDNA3-T82 CFTR, theNotI-ApaI fragment of pcDNA3-CFTR was replaced with the corresponding fragments from pBluescript-T26 CFTR and pBluescript-T82 CFTR. T70 CFTR (corresponding to Q1411X) and T98 CFTR (corresponding to I1383X) were engineered by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (sense primer, 5′-TGC AAG AAT GGC CAA CTC TCG CC-3′; antisense primers, 5′-A AAG GGC CCG CTA GCA TTC CAG CAT TGC TTC-3′ and 5′-AAA GGG CCC CTA TTG GTA TGT TAC TGG ATC C-3′) by introducing a TAG stop codon flanked with an ApaI restriction site 3′ to nucleotides 4362 and 4278, respectively. ThePmlI-ApaI fragment of pCDNA3 CFTR was replaced with the polymerase chain reaction products to obtain pCDNA3-T70 CFTR and pCDNA3-T98 CFTR. Constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the dideoxy termination method with T7 DNA polymerase. To avoid the possible impact of clonal variations on CFTR trafficking, experiments were carried out both in transient and stable heterologous expression systems. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with the pCDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen) containing wild type (WT) or mutant CFTR cDNA, using LipofectAMINE. Stable transfectants of BHK-21 cells, expressing the WT and truncated CFTRs, were generated using the pNUT expression plasmid with methotrexate (500 μm) selection (15Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). 12–24 individual clones were isolated and screened by Western blotting with mAb M3A7 (16Kartner N. Augustinas O. Jensen T.J. Naismith A.L. Riordan J.R. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). At least two to three representative clones were used for biochemical and electrophysiological studies. In addition, expression level and initial rate of biosynthesis of mutant CFTRs were determined in the mixture of BHK-21 clones after 2 weeks of selection. Western blotting with the mAbs L12B4, M3A7 (16Kartner N. Augustinas O. Jensen T.J. Naismith A.L. Riordan J.R. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), and 24-1 (Genzyme Inc. (17Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J.

The epitopes of mAb L12B4 and mAb M3A7 are located within the range of amino acid positions 386–412 and 1365–1395, respectively. 3N. Kartner, Z. Grzelczak, and J. R. Riordan, unpublished observations. The epitope for mAb 24-1 has been determined to be the five amino acids at the C terminus of CFTR (17Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). To compare CFTR expression levels, immunoblots were quantitated using a DuoScan transparency scanner and ImageQuant software. Immunoblots with multiple exposures were analyzed. Cells were depleted in cysteine- and methionine-free α-minimum Eagle's medium (30 min, 37 °C) and pulsed in the same medium containing 0.1–0.2 mCi/ml [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 20–30 min at 37 °C as described (18Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The chase was performed in DMEM (COS-1 cells) or F12/DMEM (BHK-21 cells) supplemented with 5–10% fetal bovine serum for the specified time. Cells were solubilized in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% deoxycholate, pH 8.0) containing 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin, 10 mm iodoacetamide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and CFTR was immunoprecipitated with mAbs L12B4 and M3A7. The radioactivity associated with CFTR was quantified using a PhosphorImager (PDI) and ImageQuant software. Whole cell currents were recorded by the method of Hamill et al. (19Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15138) Google Scholar). The pipette filling solution contained (in mm) 110 sodium gluconate, 20 NaCl, 8 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 glucose, 2 ATP, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.2. The bath solution was as follows: 137 NaCl, 3 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2. Where indicated, gluconate substitution was used to lower the extracellular Cl− concentration to 36 mm. The holding potential was −60 mV. For an analysis of the current-voltage relationship, the potential was stepped between −90 and +90 mV in 15-mV increments. Voltage steps were applied for 300 ms at 800-ms intervals. Currents were recorded and analyzed using the AXOPATCH and CLAMPFIT software, respectively (20Lukacs G.L. Chang X.B. Bear C. Kartner N. Mohamed A. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21592-21598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Currents were normalized per unit capacitance to account for variations in cell size. All electrophysiological measurements were conducted at room temperature (22–24 °C). Indirect immunofluorescence localization of WT and truncated CFTR (N-terminally tagged with the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope) was performed in COS-1 cells. After 36 h of transfection by calcium-phosphate precipitation, cells were exposed to 4 mm sodium butyrate overnight to enhance the expression of the transgene. HA-tagged CFTRs were visualized with murine monoclonal anti-HA (Babco, mAb 9E10) and fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory Inc.). The functional characterization of the HA-tagged CFTR will be described elsewhere. Analysis of mutations found in the Cystic Fibrosis Genetic Consortium Database revealed that the shortest truncation, which manifests in CF with pancreatic insufficiency and recurrent pulmonary infection, is Q1412X (the genotype and clinical symptoms of the patient were kindly provided by C. J. Taylor, University of Sheffield, UK). Similar severe CF phenotype was reported for frameshift mutations 4326delTC, 4279insA, and 4271delC, which lead to the deletion of the last 81, 97, and 101 amino acid residues, respectively (Cystic Fibrosis Genetic Consortium Database). These observations suggested to us that deletion of the C terminus compromises the function and/or biosynthesis of CFTR. To elucidate the role of the C-terminal tail, the biochemical and functional properties of successively truncated CFTRs (T26, T70, T82, and T98 CFTR) were investigated in heterologous expression systems. The subcellular distribution of T70, T82, and T98 CFTRs was examined first, because intracellular retention of mutant CFTRs by the ER quality control mechanism is the most prevalent cause of CF (10Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). WT and truncated CFTRs bearing an N-terminal influenza HA epitope were expressed transiently in COS-1 cells and visualized with immunofluorescence using monoclonal anti-HA antibody. In contrast to ΔF508 CFTR, which displayed an intracellular, ER-like distribution pattern (Fig. 1, inset), both WT and truncated CFTRs were detectable at the cell surface and inside the cell (Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained for T70 CFTR stably expressed in BHK-21 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that intracellular retention is unlikely to be responsible for the impaired functional expression of truncated CFTRs. To confirm that truncated CFTRs are functional at the plasma membrane, electrophysiological recordings were performed in the whole cell configuration on BHK-21 cells stably transfected with WT and mutant CFTRs. Expression of the mutants conferred cAMP-stimulated whole cell currents on BHK-21 cells (Fig. 2A). The linear current-voltage relationship under symmetrical conditions and the voltage-independent cAMP-stimulated current of the truncation constructs resembled the characteristics of WT CFTR (Fig. 2, A–C). Under symmetrical conditions, the reversal potentials (Vrev) of PKA-stimulated whole cell current of WT, T26, T70, T82, and T98 CFTR were −6.0 ± 3.6, −4.7 ± 2.8, −5.8 ± 2.7, −3.6 ± 1.8, and −3.8 ± 1.9 mV (mean ± S.E., n = 4–5), respectively. Upon imposing a 4-fold chloride concentration gradient directed from the extracellular compartment toward the cytosol, theVrev for the same variants were as follows: −36.9 ± 0.5, −36.2 ± 0.5, −35.7 ± 0.35, −37.1 ± 0.4, and −36.1 ± 0.4, respectively. Considering that the predicted Vrev under symmetrical and asymmetrical conditions is 0 and −36.0 mV, respectively, these results suggest that the chloride ion selectivity of the truncated CFTRs is preserved. On the other hand, the mean cAMP-activated current density (picoampere/picofarad) for T70, T82, and T98 CFTR were only ≈10% of the densities observed for the WT CFTR in the presence of forskolin, IBMX, and CTP-cAMP (Fig. 2D). Because similar current densities were obtained on two to three independent clones, we are confident that the ≈90% reduction in current densities is a consequence of the truncation of CFTR rather than clonal variations. Importantly, the cAMP-activated current density of T26 was almost identical to that of WT CFTR, consistent with recent observations, indicating that deletion of the last 26 amino acid residues has no effect on the CFTR channel function (21Mickle J.E. Macek Jr M. Fulmer-Smentek S.B. Egan M.M. Schwiebert E. Guggino W. Moss R. Cutting G.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To address the possibility that a decrease in the expression level of the truncated CFTRs accounts for the reduced current densities, the steady-state level of mutant CFTRs was determined with immunoblotting. Three monoclonal anti-CFTR antibodies (mAbs), L12B4, M3A7 (16Kartner N. Augustinas O. Jensen T.J. Naismith A.L. Riordan J.R. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), and 24-1 (17Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar) were used, which recognize NBD1, NBD2, and the C-terminal five amino acid residues, respectively. Both core-glycosylated (band B, molecular mass ≈ 150 kDa) and complex-glycosylated (band C, molecular mass ≈ 170 kDa) WT and mutant CFTRs could be identified on the immunoblots of stably transfected BHK-21 cell extracts probed with mAbs L12B4, M3A7, and 24-1 (Fig. 3A). Successive truncations resulted in predictable alterations in the properties of CFTR; gradual decreases in the molecular mass of the core- and complex-glycosylated CFTRs, the inability of mAb 24-1 to recognize any of the truncated species, and the inability of mAb M3A7 to recognize T98 CFTR. According to densitometric analysis of immunoblots, the expression level of the complex-glycosylated T70, T82, and T98 CFTR decreased by 90–95% compared with WT CFTR in individual clones (Fig. 3A) as well as in the mixture of clones (not shown). The loss of CFTR expression from the cell surface manifested in the ≈90% reduction of the cAMP-activated chloride current densities (Fig. 2D). Comparable reduction was observed in the expression of T70, T82, and T98 CFTR in the COS-1 transient expression system detected with L12B4 and M3A7 antibodies (Fig. 3B), verifying the results obtained in stable transfectants. Keeping in line with the whole cell current recordings and the data of Mickle et al. (21Mickle J.E. Macek Jr M. Fulmer-Smentek S.B. Egan M.M. Schwiebert E. Guggino W. Moss R. Cutting G.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the deletion of the last 26 residues had no impact on CFTR expression in transient or in stable transfectants (Figs.2D and 3, A and B). Although in the absence of single-channel recordings we cannot rule out the possibility that truncations alter the open probability (po) and/or unitary conductance of the CFTR, this seems unlikely because an ≈90% reduction in the expression level of WT CFTR has been associated with an ≈90% loss of the cAMP-stimulated whole cell current density in CHO-BQ1 cells (Figs.2D and Fig. 3A). 4Lowering the copy number and the expression of WT CFTR was achieved using 10 μmmethotrexate during the clonal selection of CHO-BQ1 cells. To assure a high copy number of WT and mutant CFTR, BHK-21 cells were selected in medium supplemented with 500 μm methotrexate. In principle, decreased stability of the mutant transcripts, defective post-translational folding, and accelerated degradation, or a combination of these processes, could explain the abrupt reduction in the expression levels of complex-glycosylated, mutant CFTRs. Thus, further experiments were done to determine which of these factors play a role. The rate of biosynthesis of the truncated CFTRs was determined by pulse labeling of the newly synthesized proteins and quantifying incorporation of label by immunoprecipitation and phosphor-image analysis. The results showed that the biosynthesis of the mutant CFTRs was not reduced compared with the WT rate (data not shown). The folding efficiency of truncated CFTR was determined by monitoring the conversion of core-glycosylated protein to the complex-glycosylated form (Fig. 3A) (18Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The processing efficiencies of transiently expressed T26, T70, and T82 CFTR were found to be between 22 and 28%, comparable with that of WT CFTR both in transient (TableI) and stable transfectants (17Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 22Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the folding efficiency of T98 CFTR was decreased from 22 to 12%, indicating a 2-fold increase in the degradation rate for core-glycosylated T98 (Table I). This decrease is conceivably because T98 is the only truncation encroaching upon NBD2, the predicted second nucleotide binding domain, deleting a few of its C-terminal residues. Whereas the half-lives (t½) of core-glycosylated T82, T70, and T26 and WT CFTR are ≈40 min, T98 has at½ ≈ 20 min (Table I). These data indicate that the C-terminal tail, encompassing the last 82 amino acid residues, are not essential for the post-translational folding and biosynthetic processing. Based on the decreased steady-state level, which coincides with normal biosynthetic processing of the T70 and T82 CFTR, we propose that the C-terminal tail is essential to maintain the stability of mature, complex-glycosylated CFTR.Table IMaturation efficiency and turn-over rate of truncated and WT CFTRCFTRMaturation efficiencyt½ core-glycosylated COS-1t½ complex-glycosylatedCOS-1BHK% ± S.E.hhWT28 ± 20.71410T2628 ± 20.81211T7028 ± 20.83.51.6T8222 ± 20.83.51.5T989 ± 10.43.62.0The maturation efficiency was assessed in experiments described in Fig. 3C using quantitative phosphor-image analysis and was expressed as the percent of core-glycosylated CFTR converted to complex-glycosylated CFTR, as described previously (18Lukacs G.L.

The half-lives of the core- and complex-glycosylated WT CFTR and truncated CFTRs were calculated from experiments performed with COS-1 and BHK-21 cells as shown in Figs. 3C and 4. To test this hypothesis, the turn-over of complex-glycosylated, truncated CFTR was assessed by pulse-chase labeling. As we anticipated, the t½ of stably expressed complex-glycosylated T70, T82, and T98 CFTR was reduced 5- to 6-fold (t½ ≈ 1.6–2 h), compared with T26 and WT CFTR (t½ ≈ 10–11 h), as shown in Fig. 4, A and B. A comparable reduction in the t½ of the complex-glycosylated form was observed in COS-1 cells transiently expressing the truncated CFTRs (Fig. 4C and Table I). The accelerated turn-over of the complex-glycosylated T70, T82, and T98 CFTRs, both in transient and stable expression systems, provides a plausible explanation for the reduction in their steady-state level and for the corresponding diminution in the cAMP-stimulated whole cell current density (Fig. 2D). These observations can account, at least in part, for the severe CF phenotype seen in compound heterozygote CF patients who have a ΔF508 CFTR allele and an allele with a truncation mutation. The classes of CF-associated mutations can be grouped into two major categories (4Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar, 8Zielenski J. Tsui L.-C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 777-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The first group includes those mutants that are unable to accumulate at the cell surface, either because of impaired biosynthesis (Class I and Class V), or because of defective folding at the ER (Class II). Mutants that belong to the second category are expressed at the cell surface but fail to translocate chloride ions because of a defect in activation (Class IV) or channel conductance (Class III). Because the biosynthetic processing and macroscopic chloride channel function of some of the truncated CFTR constructs appear to be normal but the biological stability of their mature, complex-glycosylated form is dramatically reduced, we propose a third category of mutations (putatively designated Class VI), which would include stability mutants such as those characterized in the present work. The molecular mechanism underlying the stabilization of CFTR by the C-terminal tail remains to be resolved. The C-terminal tail of CFTR might confer stability on CFTR by several mechanisms or a combination thereof. For example, C-terminal truncation could facilitate lysosomal degradation of the mutant CFTR by exposing endo-lysosomal sorting motifs (23Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 24Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), or it might prevent efficient recycling from the endosomal compartment back to the cell surface (25Prince L.S. Workman Jr., R.B. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 26Lukacs G.L. Segal G. Kartner N. Grinstein S. Zhang F. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The absence of the C-terminal tail may structurally destabilize folded CFTR, increasing the portion of non-native molecules that are susceptible to proteolysis (27Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar, 28Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6879) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the last five residues at the C terminus can bind to NHERF or to its human homologue, EBP50 (29Wang S. Raab R.W. Schatz P.J. Guggino W.B. Li M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 30Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D. Kreda S.M. Bretscher A. Boucher R.C. Stutts J.M. Milgram S.L. J. Biol.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). It was speculated that the association of CFTR with NHERF may stabilize CFTR by tethering it to the cytoskeleton. However, the physiological significance of this interaction has to be further investigated in the light of the normal lung and pancreatic function of patients homozygous for the deletion of the C-terminal 26 residues (21Mickle J.E. Macek Jr M. Fulmer-Smentek S.B. Egan M.M. Schwiebert E. Guggino W. Moss R. Cutting G.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our results are the first to highlight the role of the C-terminal domain in determining the expression level of CFTR by increasing the metabolic stability of CFTR in post-ER compartments and to provide an explanation for the severe phenotype of CF patients harboring premature truncations. In the broader context of pathomechanisms of genetic disease, the significance of our observations lies in the recognition that mutations can reduce the expression level of a membrane protein not only by impairing its biogenesis but also by accelerating the degradation of a fully processed, functional protein.

As voltage sensor, the DHPR regulates intracellular Ca2+ release via the skeletal isoform of the ryanodine receptor (RyR-1). Interaction with RyR-1 also feeds back to increase the Ca2+ current mediated by the DHPR. To identify regions of the DHPR important for receiving this signal from RyR-1, we expressed in dysgenic myotubes a chimera (SkLC) having skeletal (Sk) DHPR sequence except for a cardiac (C) II-III loop (L).

Introducing a short skeletal segment (α1Sresidues 720–765) into the cardiac II-III loop (replacing α1C residues 851–896) of GFP-SkLC restored both EC coupling and Ca2+ current densities like those of the wild type skeletal DHPR. This 46-amino acid stretch of skeletal sequence was recently shown to be capable of transferring strong, skeletal-type EC coupling to an otherwise cardiac DHPR (Nakai, J., Tanabe, T., Konno, T., Adams, B., and Beam, K.G. (1998) J. Biol. Chem.273, 24983–24986). Thus, this segment of the skeletal II-III loop contains a motif required for both skeletal-type EC coupling and RyR-1-mediated enhancement of Ca2+ current.

In skeletal muscle, the DHPR functions both as an L-type Ca2+ channel and as the voltage sensor, which in response to plasmalemmal depolarization, transmits a signal that causes RyR-1 (the skeletal RyR isoform) to release Ca2+ from the SR (1Rios E.

Nature. 1994; 369: 556-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The nature of the signal transmitted from the skeletal DHPR to RyR-1 is not yet understood, although there is strong evidence that skeletal-type EC coupling does not rely upon the entry of external Ca2+ (4Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F.M. Horowicz P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 267: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). An approach to identifying regions of the skeletal DHPR that are important for EC coupling has been to express cDNAs encoding chimeric DHPRs in dysgenic myotubes, which lack endogenous skeletal DHPRs. This work has shown that a purely cardiac DHPR expressed in dysgenic myotubes results in EC coupling which is cardiac type (dependent on entry of Ca2+) (5Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 344: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), whereas skeletal-type EC coupling results from expression of a chimeric DHPR having cardiac sequence except for a skeletal II-III loop (6Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that strong skeletal-type coupling could be produced by a chimeric DHPR that contained only a 46-amino acid skeletal segment within the II-III loop and weak skeletal-type coupling by a chimera containing only an 18-amino acid skeletal segment (7Nakai J. Tanabe T. Konno T. Adams B. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24893-24896Google Scholar). Analysis of myotubes from dyspedic mice, which lack RyR-1, has revealed that in addition to the orthograde (EC coupling) signal transmitted from the skeletal DHPR to RyR-1, there also appears to be a retrograde signal whereby RyR-1 increases the magnitude of the L-type Ca2+ current mediated by the DHPR. In particular, Ca2+ current density is very low in dyspedic myotubes even though the surface density of DHPRs appears to be essentially normal (8Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 9Fleig A. Takeshima H. Penner R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 496: 339-345Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Expression of cDNA encoding RyR-1 causes the density of L-type current in dyspedic myotubes to increase toward normal (8Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). However, these experiments did not reveal whether the region of the skeletal DHPR that is crucial for orthograde coupling is also important for the RyR-1-mediated enhancement of DHPR Ca2+current. Here we describe experiments to identify regions of the skeletal DHPR that are critical for the ability of the DHPR to receive the retrograde (current-enhancing) signal from RyR-1. The results demonstrate that the II-III loop is critical for both orthograde and retrograde signaling. Within the II-III loop, the 46-amino acid segment found to be important for skeletal-type EC coupling is also important for transducing the retrograde signal from RyR-1. Chimeras between the α1 subunits of the skeletal muscle DHPR (Sk (10Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A. Flockerzi V. Takahashi H. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Hirose T. Numa S.

Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar)) had amino acid composition (numbers in parentheses) as follows. SkLC: Sk (1–654), C (777–927), Sk (797–1873). SkLCS46: Sk (1–654), C (777–850), Sk (720–765), C (897–927), Sk (797–1873). SkLCS18: Sk (1–654), C (777–855), Sk (725–742), C (874–927), Sk (797–1873). The chimeras were constructed and inserted into mammalian expression vectors as described below (nucleotide numbers (nt) indicated in parentheses): The EcoRI-XmnI fragment of Sk (nt 1007–1964) was coligated with the ligation product from theXmnI-HincII fragment of C (nt 2330–2782) plus the HincII-XhoI fragment of Sk (nt 2389–2654) into the corresponding EcoRI/XhoI restriction sites of a SacII-XhoI subclone of Sk (nt 86–2654) in pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene). Finally, theSacII-XhoI insert of the modified subclone (now carrying the cardiac II-III loop sequence) was ligated into the corresponding SacII/XhoI restriction sites of plasmid pCAC6, which contains the complete skeletal DHPR coding region in the mammalian expression vector pKCRH2 (6Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The EcoRI-XmnI fragment of Sk (nt 1007–1964) was coligated with theXmnI-AflII* fragment (nt C2330-Sk2297) (partial cut) of clone CSk53 (7Nakai J. Tanabe T. Konno T. Adams B. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24893-24896Google Scholar) which is C (1–850), Sk (720–765), C (897–2171) into the corresponding EcoRI/AflII restriction sites (nt Sk1007/C2690) of the modified (the cardiac II-III loop carrying) SacII-XhoI subclone of Sk (nt 86–2654) in pBluescript SK+. To yield SkLCS46, theSacII-XhoI insert was ligated into the corresponding SacII/XhoI restriction sites of plasmid pCAC6 (see above). The asterisks here and below indicate restriction sites generated by polymerase chain reaction. The EcoRI-XmnI fragment of Sk (nt 1007–1964) was coligated with theXmnI-AflII fragment (nt C2330-C2690) of clone CSk58 (7Nakai J. Tanabe T. Konno T. Adams B. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24893-24896Google Scholar), which is C (1–855), Sk (725–742), C (874–2171), into the corresponding EcoRI/AflII restriction sites (nt Sk1007/C2690) of the modified (with the cardiac II-III loop inserted)SacII-XhoI subclone of Sk (nt 86–2654) in pBluescript SK+. Finally, the SacII-XhoI insert was ligated into the corresponding SacII/XhoI restriction sites of plasmid pCAC6 (see above) to yield SkLCS18. The coding sequence of the α1 subunit of the skeletal muscle DHPR (10Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A. Flockerzi V. Takahashi H. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1987; 328: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) was inserted in-frame and downstream of the coding region of a modified green fluorescence protein (GFP), cloned in a proprietary mammalian expression vector (kindly provided by P. Seeburg) as described in detail elsewhere (12Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The SalI*-EcoRI fragment of GFP-α1S (nt 5′ polylinker-Sk1007) was coligated with theEcoRI-BglII fragments of clones SkLC, SkLCS46, and SkLCS18 (nt Sk1007-Sk4488) into the corresponding SalI*/BglII restriction sites of plasmid GFP-α1S. The Ca2+ channel β1b subunit cDNA (kindly provided by K. Campbell) was cloned as a SacI-HindIII fragment (5′ and 3′ polylinker, respectively) into the SacI/HindIII polylinker sites of the mammalian expression vector pSV-SPORT1 (LifeTechnologies, Inc.). The integrity of all the chimeric DHPRs was confirmed by sequence analysis using an ABI 377 automatic sequencer. Primary cultures of myotubes isolated from newborn dysgenic mice were prepared as described previously (13Adams B.A. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 week after plating, myotubes were microinjected (2Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 336: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) into a single nucleus with solutions of expression plasmids (300–600 ng/μl) carrying cDNAs for either GFP-α1S, GFP-SkLC, GFP-SkLCS46, or GFP-SkLCS18. Injected myotubes were subsequently examined for the development of green fluorescence. Expressing cells were evaluated for contraction (2Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 336: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) in response to electrical stimulation (80 V, 10–30 ms), macroscopic Ca2+ currents, immobilization-resistant intramembrane charge movement (14Adams B.A. Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 346: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and subcellular channel distribution (only for GFP-SkLC). In a separate set of experiments examining the role of the β1b subunit for Ca2+ channel enhancement, dysgenic myotubes were coinjected with GFP-SkLC cDNA (600 ng/μl) and 350 ng/μl β1b-carrying mammalian expression plasmid. Additionally, dyspedic myotubes were grown in primary culture as described for dysgenic myotubes (13Adams B.A. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and mononuclearly injected (2Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 336: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) with 350 ng/μl β1b-carrying mammalian expression plasmid together with pure GFP vector (25 ng/μl) to enable the identification of expressing cells. Macroscopic Ca2+ currents were measured using the whole-cell patch clamp technique (15Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar). The patch pipettes (borosilicate glass) had resistances of 1.5–1.9 MΩ when filled with an internal solution containing 140 mm cesium aspartate, 10 mm Cs2-EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with CsOH). The composition of the external bath solution was 10 mm CaCl2, 145 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 3 μmtetrodotoxin, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with tetraethylammonium hydroxide). Test pulses were preceded by a 1-s prepulse to −30 mV to inactivate endogenous T-type Ca2+currents (14Adams B.A. Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 346: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Test currents were corrected for linear components of leakage and capacitative currents by digitally scaling and subtracting the average of 10 preceding control currents, elicited by hyperpolarizing voltage steps (20–40 mV amplitude) applied from the holding potential of −80 mV. Ca2+ currents were normalized by linear cell capacitance (expressed in pA/pF). After the recording of whole-cell Ca2+ currents, 0.5 mmCd2+, and 0.1 mm La3+ were added to the external bath solution to enable the recording of immobilization-resistant intramembrane charge movement (gating currents). The procedure for recording and calculating maximum charge movement densities and the prepulse protocol used was described in detail elsewhere (14Adams B.A. Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 346: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 16Adams B.A. Mori Y. Kim M.S. Tanabe T. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of Ca2+release on sarcolemmal Ca2+ current, Ca2+current and Ca2+ transients were measured (17Garcia J. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) in normal myotubes with the external solution described above for Ca2+ currents and patch pipettes containing an internal solution composed either of 145 mm cesium glutamate, 8 mm MgATP, 0.5 mm K5-Fluo-3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), 2 mm CsCl, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with CsOH (10 EGTA solution) or 65 mm cesium glutamate, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm K5-Fluo-3, 40 mm BAPTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 with CsOH (40 BAPTA solution). For the measurement of Ca2+ transients in dysgenic myotubes expressing chimeric DHPRs, the pipette contained 145 mm cesium glutamate, 8 mm MgATP, 0.5 mm K5-Fluo-3, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm CsCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with CsOH), and the external solutions was 150 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 μm tetrodotoxin (pH 7.2 with tetraethylammonium hydroxide). For the measurements of Ca2+ transients, it was not suitable to use the GFP-tagged constructs that had fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths close to those of Fluo-3. Thus, cDNAs coding for SkLC, SkLCS46, and SkLCS18 were inserted into the expression plasmid pKCRH2 (18Mishina M. Kurosaki T. Tobimatsu T. Morimoto Y. Noda M. Yamamoto T. Terao M. Lindstrom J. Takahashi T. Kuno M. Numa S. Nature. 1984; 307: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and were coinjected with cDNA encoding the α subunit of the human surface antigen CD8 (19Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. Biotechniques. 1994; 17: 876-880PubMed Google Scholar). Myotubes expressing the mutant channels were identified using polystyrene beads coated with CD8 antibodies as described previously (20Garcia J. Nakai J. Imoto K. Beam K.G. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2515-2523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Transient changes in fluorescence (ΔF) were normalized by the resting fluorescence (F). The maximum rate of change of ΔF/F was determined by fitting a line segment to the steepest portion of the transient. All recordings were made at room temperature (∼20 °C) and data are reported as mean ± S.D. GFP-SkLC-expressing dysgenic myotubes cultured on 35-mm culture dishes were superfused with a normal rodent Ringer solution (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 with NaOH) and mounted under a glass coverslip. The culture dish was subsequently fastened upside-down on the stage of a Nikon inverted microscope. Fluorescing cells were analyzed using a Sarastro 2000 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Molecular Dynamics) with a Nikon 60× PlanApo oil immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.40) and the ImageSpace™ software (Silicon Graphics Inc., Mt. View, CA). GFP excitation/emission was achieved with a filter set (488 nm/510 nm) designed for fluorescein detection. Images were 1024 × 1024 pixels with a pixel size of 0.11 μm. Step size between confocal sections was 2 μm. Images were processed using the Adobe Photoshop software (ADOBE Systems, Mountain View, CA). Previous work showed that the cardiac DHPR expressed in dysgenic (DHPR-deficient) myotubes was unable to mediate orthograde signaling (i.e. skeletal EC coupling). However, a chimera with cardiac sequence except for a skeletal II-III loop (CSk3 (5Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 344: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar)) could mediate orthograde signaling. More recently, it was found that the expression of RyR-1 in dyspedic (RyR-deficient) myotubes increased the amplitude of slow L-type Ca2+ current produced by the skeletal DHPR (8Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). To determine whether the II-III loop plays an important role in “receiving” this current-enhancing signal from RyR-1, we constructed a chimeric DHPR (SkLC) that was the “inverse” of CSk3: a skeletal DHPR except for a cardiac II-III loop. Electrically evoked contractions were never observed in dysgenic myotubes that had been injected with SkLC, consistent either with the possibility that the chimera was nonfunctional or that a cardiac II-III loop abolished orthograde signaling. Because electrically evoked contraction could not be used to identify myotubes expressing SkLC, we constructed a cDNA that fused GFP to the amino terminus of SkLC (Fig. 1a) to allow definitive identification by means of in situ fluorescence. Fusion proteins of this sort were shown previously not to affect the function of either muscle or brain Ca2+ channels (12Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Myotubes expressing GFP-SkLC displayed slowly activating Ca2+currents (Fig. 2b), which were much smaller in amplitude than those present in GFP-α1S-expressing myotubes (Fig. 2a). To allow comparisons between cells, peak current-voltage relationships were fitted (14Adams B.A. Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 346: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) to yield a value of maximal Ca2+conductance (Gmax). The value ofGmax for GFP-SkLC was significantly (p < 0.005) smaller than for GFP-α1S(Table I). This decrease inGmax for GFP-SkLC did not appear to be a consequence of a reduced number of DHPRs expressed in the surface membrane because values for maximal charge movement (Qmax) were similar (p > 0.05) for GFP-SkLC and GFP-α1S (Fig. 2,d and e; Table I). The ratio of Gmax to Qmax′( Qmax′ equalsQmax minus the average, endogenous charge in dysgenic myotubes; Ref. 14Adams B.A. Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 346: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) for GFP-SkLC was less than half that for GFP-α1S (Table I). Thus, it appears that the presence of a cardiac II-III loop prevents GFP-SkLC from receiving the current-enhancing signal from RyR-1. Indeed, the value ofGmax/ Qmax′ for GFP-SkLC was very close to the value found for dyspedic myotubes (8Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), which have α1S but lack RyR-1.Figure 2Representative whole-cell Ca2+currents recorded from dysgenic myotubes expressing GFP-α1S (a), GFP-SkLC (b), and GFP-SkLCS46(c). Macroscopic Ca2+ currents were elicited by 200-ms step depolarizations from a holding potential of −80 mV to the test potentials indicated on the left (in mV). Current amplitudes were normalized by linear cell capacitance and are expressed as pA/pF. d–f, immobilization-resistant intramembrane charge movements were recorded in response to a depolarization to +40 mV following a prepulse protocol (14Adams B.A. Tanabe T.

Nakai et al. (7Nakai J. Tanabe T. Konno T. Adams B. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24893-24896Google Scholar) previously showed that substitution of a 46-amino acid segment of skeletal sequence into the II-III loop of an otherwise cardiac DHPR produced a chimera (CSk53; α1S residues 720–765) capable of mediating strong, skeletal-type EC coupling upon expression in dysgenic myotubes. To determine whether this motif (Fig. 1 b) is also sufficient to allow reception of the Ca2+ current-enhancing signal from RyR-1, we substituted this 46-residue segment into the cardiac II-III loop of the otherwise skeletal chimera GFP-SkLC. The resulting chimera, GFP-SkLCS46 (Fig. 1 a), not only mediated skeletal-type EC coupling (electrically evoked contraction of more than half of the fluorescent cells tested in Cd2+/La3+, n > 50; data not shown) but also produced large Ca2+ current densities (Fig. 2c) with aGmax/ Qmax′ratio (>30 nS/pC) like those of GFP-α1S or α1S (Table I). Nakai et al. (7Nakai J. Tanabe T. Konno T. Adams B. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24893-24896Google Scholar) also showed that an otherwise cardiac chimera containing an even shorter (18-residue) skeletal segment (CSk58, α1S residues 725–742) was still able to mediate skeletal-type EC coupling; however, this coupling was weak (7Nakai J. Tanabe T. Konno T. Adams B. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24893-24896Google Scholar). To test if this 18-amino acid segment allows reception of the channel-enhancing signal from RyR-1, we constructed chimera GFP-SkLCS18 (Fig. 1, a and b). The value ofGmax for GFP-SkLCS18 was not significantly different from that of GFP-SkLC (Table I;p > 0.05). Additionally, theGmax/ Qmax′ratio for GFP-SkLCS18 was similar to that found for GFP-SkLC expressed in dysgenic myotubes or that of endogenous α1S in dyspedic myotubes that lack RyR-1 (Table I). Therefore, the minimal DHPR sequence that allows strong enhancement of Ca2+ current by RyR-1 is incomplete in, or missing from, the 18-residue skeletal segment in the II-III loop of GFP-SkLCS18. However, this minimal sequence is contained within the 46-residue skeletal segment of the GFP-SkLCS46II-III loop. The measurement ofGmax/ Qmax′provides a quantitative assessment of the strength of retrograde coupling (current enhancement from RyR-1). To obtain a similarly quantitative assessment of the strength of orthograde (EC) coupling to RyR-1, we measured depolarization-induced Ca2+ transients. Depolarization-induced Ca2+ transients were never observed with SkLC (Fig. 3 a, 0 of 13 cells tested) but were routinely observed for SkLCS46 (Fig. 3 b, 16 of 16 cells tested). The transients support the conclusion that SkLCS46 mediates skeletal-type EC coupling because they were of similar magnitude for test pulses to +30 mV (where Ca2+ current is near maximal) and +80 mV (where Ca2+ current is small as a result of reduced driving force). By the same logic, SkLCS18 was also able to mediate skeletal-type coupling because the Ca2+ transients were again similar at +30 and +80 mV (Fig. 3 c). However, the maximal rate of increase of the ΔF/F signal (at +80 mV) was only 0.023 ± 0.012 ms−1 (n = 12) for SkLCS18, which is almost 5-fold lower than the value of 0.112 ± 0.025 ms−1 (n = 16) for SkLCS46. Thus, skeletal-type coupling is much weaker for SkLCS18 than for SkLCS46. It is possible to calculate the enhancement of Ca2+ current that might have been expected for SkLCS18 relative to that measured for SkLCS46 under the assumption that there is a linear relationship between the strengths of retrograde and orthograde signaling. The enhancement of current for SkLCS46 can be defined as (G/ Q46′ − G/Q′) ÷ Q46′, where G/ Q46′ and G/Q′ are the values ofGmax/ Qmax′for GFP-SkLCS46 and GFP-SkLC, respectively. With"
https://openalex.org/W2014825046,"Although much is known about the mechanisms of signal-mediated protein and RNA nuclear import and export, little is understood concerning the nuclear import of plasmid DNA. Plasmids between 4.2 and 14.4 kilobases were specifically labeled using a fluorescein-conjugated peptide nucleic acid clamp. The resulting substrates were capable of gene expression and nuclear localization in microinjected cells in the absence of cell division. To elucidate the requirements for plasmid nuclear import, a digitonin-permeabilized cell system was adapted to follow the nuclear localization of plasmids. Nuclear import of labeled plasmid was time- and energy-dependent, was inhibited by the lectin wheat germ agglutinin, and showed an absolute requirement for cytoplasmic extract. Addition of nuclear extract alone did not support plasmid nuclear import but in combination with cytoplasm stimulated plasmid nuclear localization. Whereas addition of purified importin α, importin β, and RAN was sufficient to support protein nuclear import, plasmid nuclear import also required the addition of nuclear extract. Finally, nuclear import of plasmid DNA was sequence-specific, requiring a region of the SV40 early promoter and enhancer. Taken together, these results confirm and extend our findings in microinjected cells and support a protein-mediated mechanism for plasmid nuclear import.

The nuclear envelope presents an effective barrier between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the cell. Although it is impermeant to large non-nuclear molecules, a multitude of macromolecules must enter and exit the nucleus across this envelope every second in order for the cell to live. All macromolecular exchange between the nucleus and the cytoplasm studied to date occurs through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), 1The abbreviations used are: NPC, nuclear pore complex; NLS, nuclear localization signal; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PNA, peptide nucleic acid; Fl, fluorescein; Rh, rhodamine; BSA, bovine serum albumin; BSA-NLS, synthetic NLS peptide-conjugated bovine serum albumin; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; pDNA, plasmid DNA; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s). is signal-dependent, and utilizes a series of receptor proteins (for a review see Ref. 1Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). In the case of proteins destined for the nucleus, the nuclear localization signal (NLS) interacts with one of a growing number of importin family members to target the complex to the NPC. In the classical case of NLS-containing proteins, the protein binds to importin α, the NLS “receptor,” which in turn interacts with importin β. Once at the NPC, the complex interacts with the small GTP-binding protein RAN in its GDP-bound state and its accessory factor NTF2 while being translocated across the NPC. After translocation into the nucleus, the complex disassembles because of the conversion of RAN-GDP to RAN-GTP by exchange or replacement and the importins return to the cytoplasm (2Melchior F. Gerace L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 175-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Similar scenarios of receptor proteins interacting with signals to mediate translocation across the nuclear envelope also occur for the nuclear export of proteins (e.g. exportin and the nuclear export signal) and viral mRNAs (Crm1p, HIV Rev, and the Rev response element), and the nuclear import of small nuclear RNAs that contain both protein-encoded NLSs and the trimethylguanosine cap as import signals (1Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 3Moroianu J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the nuclear import of plasmid DNA (pDNA) also uses a signal-mediated pathway to enter the nucleus. Using a microinjection approach, we demonstrated that pDNA can enter the nucleus in the absence of cell division by a process that is consistent with transport through the NPC (4Dean D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Such nuclear import has been detected in all mammalian cells tested to date, including those of mouse, rat, monkey, human, and chicken, as well as those from all cell types, including smooth and striated muscle, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells. Furthermore, this import is sequence-specific: plasmids containing as little as 80 bp of the SV40 enhancer/early promoter region are targeted to the nucleus in the absence of cell division, whereas plasmids lacking this sequence remain cytoplasmic (4Dean D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). 2D. A. Dean, B. S. Dean, S. Muller, and L. C. Smith, submitted for publication. This sequence specificity appears unique to SV40, because several other strong viral promoter and enhancer sequences, including the immediate early promoter/enhancer of cytomegalovirus and the long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus, fail to promote nuclear import.2Based on the sequences required for plasmid nuclear import, we have proposed a working model in which pDNA import is mediated by newly synthesized transcription factors and other sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that bind to the DNA in the cytoplasm, thus attaching NLSs to the DNA for recognition and transport by the NLS-dependent machinery. In order to further study the mechanisms of pDNA nuclear import, an in vitro system was required. To this end, we have developed an approach to label plasmid DNA that maintains its biological activity and have adapted the digitonin-permeabilized cell assay to study plasmid nuclear localization. The 4.2-kb plasmid pUSAG3 contains a 60-bp sequence from the human G gamma globin promoter (−315 to −255) inserted into the SmaI site of the GFP promoter reporter vector pEGFP-1 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) in the same orientation as the GFP gene (see Fig. 1). To create pUSAG3ΔSV40 that lacks the SV40 nuclear targeting sequence, a 913-bp fragment containing the SV40 origin and early promoter/enhancer region was removed from pUSAG3 by digestion with StuI and SspI and religation. pUSAG9 is a 14.4-kb plasmid containing the human globin locus control region and the A-γ globin and β globin genes (nucleotides 38084–43975 and 60409–65475, EMBL ID: HSHBB4R1) inserted into the SmaI site of pEGFP-1. pUSAG9 also contains the 60-bp PNA-binding site found in pUSAG3. Rhodamine-labeled pGenegrip blank vector and Rhodamine-labeled pGenegrip GFP vector were obtained from Gene Therapy Systems (San Diego, CA). A fluorescein-labeled PNA clamp (NH2-fluorescein-OTTTTCTTCTCOOOJTJTTJTTTT-COOH; Fl-PNA) was synthesized by Perseptive Biosystems (Framingham, MA) to bind to the target GAGAAGAAA present in the 60-bp G γ globin promoter fragment (see Fig. 1). Fl-PNA (3 μm) was reacted with the purified plasmids at a 10:1 molar ratio in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA) for 3 h at 37 °C. The reactions were diluted into 2 ml of TE buffer and concentrated to 50 μl in a Centricon-30 microconcentration device, diluted again to 2 ml, and reconcentrated to a final concentration of between 0.1 and 0.2 mg/ml plasmid. Approximately 30 μg of pDNA was labeled in a typical experiment. Labeled DNAs were stored at −80 °C. The pGenegrip vectors were obtained as labeled DNAs from the manufacturer. HeLa cells were grown on coverslips in minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Purified PNA-labeled pDNA was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml and microinjected into the cytoplasm of cells grown on etched coverslips as described (4Dean D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). With a microinjection volume of approximately 3 × 10−10 ml/cell,2 about 2,000 plasmids were delivered per cell. The cells were incubated for various times, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 15 min at 4 °C in 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and mounted with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole/diazobicyclo[2.2.2]octane. The human genes for importin β and RAN were polymerase chain reaction-amplified from reverse-transcribed HeLa cell RNA using oligonucleotide primers containing unique restrictions sites at the ends and cloned into the corresponding restriction sites of ptrcHisB (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). A plasmid expressing the yeast importin α homologue, hSRP1α, was obtained from K. Weis (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany) (5Weis K. Mattaj I.W. Lamond A.I. Science. 1995; 268: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The plasmids were transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) and expressed and purified by nickel affinity chromatography as described for the appropriate protein (5Weis K. Mattaj I.W. Lamond A.I. Science. 1995; 268: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 6Moroianu J. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Permeabilized cell assays were performed as described previously using HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips (7Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to 60% confluency, washed with wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 110 mmpotassium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol), and permeabilized with 40 μg/ml digitonin in wash buffer for 6–8 min on ice. The cells were rinsed for 5–10 min with several changes of cold wash buffer, and the excess buffer was removed before the assays were initiated. Reactions were carried out in a transport buffer consisting of wash buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1 mm GTP, 2 mm ATP, 10 mmphosphocreatine, and 20 units/ml of creatine phosphokinase. Rhodamine- or fluorescein-labeled NLS peptide-conjugated BSA (Fl- or Rh-BSA-NLS) were included at 25 μg/ml and fluorescein-labeled PNA plasmids were present at 10 μg/ml. Where indicated, cytoplasmic extracts prepared from HeLa cells (7Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar) were added to between 5 and 7 mg/ml, HeLa cell nuclear extracts (in vitro transcription grade, Promega, Madison, WI) were added to 0.25 mg/ml, and affinity purified, recombinant his-tagged RAN, importin α, and importin β were used at 0.5 mg/ml each. The lectins wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and concanavalin A were added to 0.1 mg/ml each. In reactions lacking ATP and GTP, nucleotide triphosphates, phosphocreatine, and creatine-phosphokinase were omitted from the transport buffer and ATP-depleted extracts were prepared by incubating the extracts with 10 units/ml apyrase for 30 min before addition to the cells. Other competitors were added as indicated in the text. The cells were incubated in a humidified chamber at 37 °C for 4 h, unless otherwise indicated. The reactions were terminated by washing the cells in wash buffer and fixing them at 4 °C for 15 min in 3% paraformaldehyde in wash buffer. The cells were mounted with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole/diazobicyclo[2.2.2]octane, and 0.5-μm sections were viewed by confocal microscopy using an ACAS 570 laser-scanning confocal microscope. PNA-labeled and unlabeled plasmids were incubated in transport buffer containing HeLa cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts (5 and 0.25 mg/ml, respectively) for 4 h at 37 °C. At the end of the reaction, the DNA was extracted with phenol:chloroform and chloroform alone. 10 μg of tRNA were added, and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol overnight at −20 °C. The DNA was resuspended in 10 μl of TE buffer and separated on a 1% agarose gel, transferred to nylon, and immobilized by UV irradiation as described (8Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994Google Scholar). The Blot was prehybridized at 42 °C for 4 h in 50% formamide containing 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 2 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA and hybridized with 1 × 106cpm/ml of nick translated pUSAG3 and 1 × 106 cpm/ml of nick translated pGenegrip Blank for 18 h at 37 °C. The blot was washed at room temperature for 15 min each in 2× SSC/0.1% SDS, 0.5× SSC/0.1% SDS, 0.5× SSC/0.1% SDS, and for 30 min at 37 °C in 0.1× SSC/1% SDS, dried, and exposed to film. Although we have begun to make progress elucidating the mechanisms of nuclear import of plasmid DNA using microinjection and in situ hybridization, this method has its limitations because of the fact that it detects DNA in fixed samples only. A better substrate with which to follow the transport reactions in real time would be fluorescently labeled pDNA. In order to produce such substrate, we tried a variety of labeling techniques including incorporation of fluorescent nucleotide analogues (e.g. fluorescein-dUTP) by polymerase chain reaction or nick translation followed by ligation to form intact plasmid, covalent and noncovalent high affinity intercalating dyes (e.g. ethidium bromide monoazide and TOTO-1), and reaction of supercoiled plasmid with photoactivatable fluorophore conjugates. Although all of the methods produced fluorescently labeled DNA, two problems limited the use of these labeled DNAs as substrates for import reactions. First, several of the techniques produced either linear DNA or low yields of circularized plasmid, making their use impractical. More importantly, all of the labeled DNAs became inactive in both transcription of reporter genes or migration of the DNA to the nucleus in microinjected cells (not shown). We were successful, however, when we used a fluorescently labeled peptide nucleic acid (Fl-PNA) clamp; the resulting plasmids were transcriptionally active and able to localize to the nucleus as did unlabeled native plasmid. 3Wang, G., Xu, X., Pace, B., Dean, D. A., Glazer, P. M., Chan, P., Goodman, S. R., and Shoklenko, I. (1999) Nucleic Acids Res. 27, 2806–2813. The PNA we used to label plasmids bound to a 10-nucleotide sequence (GAGAAGAAAA) within the G γ globin promoter. The target site was cloned upstream of the GFP gene, well removed from the SV40 nuclear targeting sequence, which was downstream of the GFP gene, 1.6 kb away (Fig. 1). One half of the PNA invaded the target site and hybridized to its complementary sequence through standard Watson-Crick base pairs, and the other half of the PNA folded back onto the PNA:DNA double helix to form a triplex structure using Hoogstein base pairs (9Egholm M. Buchardt O. Christensen L. Behrens C. Freier S.M. Driver D.A. Berg R.H. Kim S.K. Norden B. Nielsen P.E. Nature. 1993; 365: 566-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). Fluorescein was bound to the amino terminus of the PNA and did not interfere with binding of the PNA to the target. The resulting triplex structure is highly stable (10Nielsen P.E. Egholm M. Buchardt O. Gene (Amst .). 1994; 149: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and because the backbone of the PNA utilizes peptide bonds, it is resistant to nuclease digestion and even incubation in serum (11Demidov V.V. Potaman V.N. Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Egholm M. Buchardt O. Sonnichsen S.H. Nielsen P.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). In our hands, the PNA could not be dissociated from the bound state when incubated with a 1000-fold molar excess of target sequence at 37 °C for 8 h as followed by gel shift assays (not shown). When microinjected into the cytoplasm of TC7 cells, native pDNA localizes to the nucleus within 6–8 h as detected by in situ hybridization (4Dean D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). When Fl-PNA-labeled pUSAG3 was similarly microinjected into the cytoplasm, it localized to the nucleus within 6 h (Fig. 2). Further, the subnuclear distribution of the labeled pDNA and its absence in the nucleoli was very similar to that seen with native pDNA and in situ hybridization (4Dean D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Thus, because the Fl-PNA/pDNA maintained the same biological properties as unmodified plasmid, we used it as a substrate in permeabilized cell assays to dissect the transport mechanism. Digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells have been used effectively to reconstitute nuclear import and export reactions of proteins, small nuclear RNA, and small linear DNA (7Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L.

A. 1998; 95: 10608-10613Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We also have used this system to study the requirements for fluorescently labeled pDNA nuclear entry. HeLa cells were permeabilized with digitonin and washed to remove cytoplasmic components as described previously (7Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Because all signal-mediated nuclear import reported to date has been shown to require cytosolic proteins (e.g.importins, exportins, etc.), we reasoned that signal-mediated pDNA nuclear import would behave similarly. Thus, we added cytoplasmic extracts prepared from HeLa cells along with an ATP-regenerating system, protease inhibitors, buffer, salts, and GTP to the assays. As a positive control for nuclear import, we also followed the nuclear accumulation of rhodamine-labeled BSA conjugated to a synthetic NLS peptide (Rh-BSA-NLS) to ensure that all the components were active (not shown). As seen in Fig. 3, significant Fl-PNA/pDNA import is observed within 90 min and is maximal by 4 h. In contrast, Rh-BSA-NLS was maximally imported into the nuclei by 30 min (not shown). That the extract was still fully functional and that the nuclei were not leaky at these late times were confirmed by demonstrating that protein nuclear import occurred in an NLS-dependent manner when the substrate was added 4–8 h after the cells had been permeabilized and reacted with cytoplasmic extracts (not shown). Thus, neither the cells nor the extracts lost functional activity or selectivity over this time course. Because maximal nuclear localization was observed by 4 h, this time point was used in the remainder of the experiments. To determine whether cytoplasmic extracts were indeed required for the nuclear import of pDNA, reactions were performed with various combinations of cellular extracts (Fig. 4). Our working model for signal-mediated pDNA nuclear import postulates that sequence specificity is mediated by transcription factors and DNA-binding proteins. These proteins bind to sites within the SV40 DNA nuclear targeting sequence while the DNA and the proteins are in the cytoplasm, and the NLSs present on the transcription factors enable the pDNA-protein complex to utilize the NLS-dependent machinery for nuclear import. This model predicts that cytoplasmic extracts containing both DNA-binding proteins and the NLS-dependent import machinery are necessary for nuclear import of pDNA. In support of this model, no nuclear import was observed in the absence of cytoplasmic extract of either a 4.2-kb plasmid, pUSAG3, or a 14.4-kb plasmid, pUSAG9, both of which contain the PNA-binding site and the SV40 DNA nuclear targeting sequence (Fig. 4, A and E). In contrast, when cytoplasmic extract was provided, significant nuclear import of both plasmids was detected at 4 h (Fig. 4, C and G). Interestingly, many nuclei showed distinct rim staining of the larger plasmid (Fig. 4G). This suggests either that import was not complete at 4 h and larger plasmids take longer to enter the nucleus or that one or more factors are limiting for efficient nuclear import of the larger plasmid. Because our model predicts that transcription factors and other DNA-binding proteins mediate nuclear pDNA import, nuclear extracts were tested for their ability to support or enhance nuclear import of the plasmids. Although the addition of nuclear extract alone did not support nuclear localization of the 14.4-kb plasmid (Fig. 4F), it did allow a low level of import of the smaller plasmid (Fig. 4B). Because all components of the NLS-dependent import machinery can be found in the nucleus at levels much less than those in the cytoplasm, this is not a completely surprising result. When both nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were provided to the cells, import of both plasmids was more robust (Fig. 4, D and H). Further, no rim staining was observed for either of the plasmids. Signal-mediated nuclear import and export of proteins and RNAs has been shown to be energy-dependent (7Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 12Marshallsay C. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Holaska J.M.

A. 1998; 95: 10608-10613Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Previous experiments from our laboratory using a microinjection approach have demonstrated that this is also the case for plasmid nuclear import (4Dean D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This energy dependence was confirmed in the permeabilized cell system (Fig. 5). When GTP and the ATP-regenerating system were omitted from the assays and endogenous stores of nucleotide triphosphates were depleted from the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts by pretreatment with apyrase, no nuclear localization of pDNA was detected with any combination of extracts (Fig. 5). Similarly, these treatments also prevented nuclear accumulation of Rh-BSA-NLS (data not shown), confirming that ATP levels were sufficiently low to block NLS-mediated nuclear import. Addition of the lectin WGA that binds to N-acetylglucosamine residues present on a class of NPC proteins also inhibited nuclear accumulation of pDNA in permeabilized cells (Fig. 6). When added to cells, WGA completely inhibited the nuclear import of Fl-PNA/pUSAG3 (Fig. 6C) compared with the control reaction lacking added lectin (Fig. 6A), whereas addition of the lectin concanavalin A that has been shown not to alter transport through the NPC had no effect on pDNA import (Fig. 6B). Based on the above experiments, it appeared that the need for cytoplasmic extracts for pDNA nuclear import was to supply components of the NLS-dependent transport machinery. Thus, we expressed and affinity purified histidine-tagged fusion proteins corresponding to importin α, importin β, and RAN. The proteins were judged to be >95% pure based on Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gels (data not shown). These were then added with either Rh-BSA-NLS or Fl-PNA/pUSAG3 to permeabilized cells, in the presence or absence of nuclear extract prepared from HeLa cells to provide the appropriate NLS-containing DNA-binding proteins (Fig. 7). As seen previously, in the absence of cytoplasmic extract or the importins and RAN, no nuclear import of either pDNA or Rh-BSA-NLS was observed (Fig. 7, A and E). Similarly, little or no nuclear import of either substrate was seen in the presence of nuclear extract alone (Fig. 7,B and F). Although the addition of importin α, importin β, and RAN was sufficient to drive the nuclear localization of the NLS-containing reporter protein (Fig. 7G), they were not sufficient to support import of pDNA (Fig. 7C). This suggested either that plasmid DNA does not use the importin α/β pathway for its nuclear import or that additional factors are required to allow the importins to bind to the DNA. Because neither importin α nor β bind to DNA, for them to mediate nuclear import of pDNA, an intermediary “adapter” protein would be required that binds to DNA and contains an NLS for recognition by the importins. Thus, when a nuclear extract was provided in addition to the importins and RAN, significant nuclear localization of Fl-PNA/pUSAG3 was observed (Fig. 7D). The presence of the nuclear extract had little effect on the import of Rh-BSA-NLS (Fig. 7H). To ensure that all three components of the nuclear import machinery (i.e. importin α, importin β, and RAN) were indeed required for pDNA nuclear entry, import reactions were performed in which each of the factors was left out separately (Fig. 8). As was seen in Fig. 7, significant nuclear import of both pDNA and Rh-BSA-NLS was observed in the presence of all three components and nuclear extract (Fig. 8, A and E). However, when the import reactions were performed with nuclear extract and importin α and RAN (Fig. 8, B and F), importin β and RAN (Fig. 8, C and G), or importin α and importin β (Fig. 8, Dand H), nuclear import of both substrates was eliminated. The nuclear rim staining of Rh-BSA-NLS observed in the presence of the importins alone (Fig. 8H) was expected based on previous reports (16Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 17Zelphati O. Liang X. Hobart P. Felgner P.L. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and confirms the fidelity of the recombinant proteins and the experimental system. Thus, similar to “classical” protein nuclear import, both the importins and RAN are required for plasmid nuclear entry. Competition experiments suggested that the nuclear import of Fl-PNA/pDNA was signal-mediated. When permeabilized cells were incubated with Fl-PNA/pUSAG3 in the presence of ATP and cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts, the plasmid localized to the nuclei of cells (Fig. 9A). Addition of a 1000-fold molar excess of BSA-NLS had no effect on the nuclear localization of the plasmid (Fig. 9B). This is not entirely surprising, because the small NLS-containing protein is imported into the nuclei within minutes of addition and thus is not a true competitor for the NLS-dependent machinery, which can recycle back to the cytoplasm for import of pDNA. Striking inhibition of pDNA nuclear import was seen when a 100-fold molar excess of SV40 DNA was added to the reaction (Fig. 9D), whereas a similar excess of pUC19 had no effect on pDNA import (Fig. 9C). Because both pUSAG3 and SV40 DNA share the 360-bp SV40 promoter/enhancer region that is necessary in intact cells for nuclear targeting of pDNA, it appeared likely that the permeabilized cell system faithfully reproduced this sequence specificity. To test this directly, a 913-bp fragment containing the 360-bp SV40 DNA nuclear targeting sequence was removed from pUSAG3 to create pUSAG3ΔSV40. This plasmid was labeled with Fl-PNA and used in the permeabilized cell assay in parallel to the parent Fl-PNA/pUSAG3 (Fig. 10). As expected, neither plasmid was able to localize to the nucleus in the absence of cytoplasmic extract (Fig. 10, A and C). The plasmid lacking the SV40 sequence was also unable to localize to the nuclei in the presence of cytoplasmic extract, although faint rim staining was detected (Fig. 10D), whereas the parent pUSAG3 was imported efficiently (Fig. 10B). These experiments confirm that pDNA nuclear import in permeabilized cells faithfully represents that seen in intact cells and that nuclear uptake of plasmid DNA is sequence-specific.Figure 10Sequence specificity of pDNA nuclear import in permeabilized cells. Permeabilized HeLa cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in transport buffer containing BSA alone (A and C) or HeLa cytoplasmic extract at 5 mg/ml (B and D). The substrates used were either Fl-PNA/pUSAG3 (A and B) or Fl-PNA/pUSAG3ΔSV40 (C and D), both present at 10 μg/ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (P"

Here we show that inhibition of Gi proteins with pertussis toxin (PTX) permits a full phospholamban phosphorylation and a de novo relaxant effect following β2-AR stimulation, converting the localized β2-AR signaling to a global signaling mode similar to that of β1-AR. Thus, β2-AR-mediated Gi activation constricts the cAMP signaling to the sarcolemma. PTX treatment did not significantly affect the β2-AR-stimulated PKA activation. Similar to Gi inhibition, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A (3 × 10−8m), selectively enhanced the β2-AR but not β1-AR-mediated contractile response. Furthermore, PTX and calyculin A treatment had a non-additive potentiating effect on the β2-AR-mediated positive inotropic response. These results suggest that the interaction of the β2-AR-coupled Gi and Gs signaling affects the local balance of protein kinase and phosphatase activities.

Subsequently, PKA phosphorylates a multitude of regulatory proteins involved in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, including l-type Ca2+ channels (1Bean B.P. Nowycky M.C. Tsien R.W.

In addition, PKA also phosphorylates and activates the endogenous protein phosphatase inhibitor 1 (7Neumann J. Gupta R.C. Schmitz W. Scholz H. Nairn A.C. Watanabe A.M. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which further ensures the action of protein kinases by protein phosphatase inhibition. Although cardiac β1-AR signaling follows the scheme described above, recent studies have revealed a dissociation of β2-AR-mediated positive inotropic as well as lusitropic effects from global cAMP accumulation in several mammalian species (8Xiao R.P.

Circulation. 1999; 99: 2458-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated that in contrast to β1-AR, β2-AR stimulation fails to induce a cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of non-sarcolemmal proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling and energy metabolism (e.g. phospholamban, the myofilament proteins, troponin I, C protein, and the cytosolic protein glycogen phosphorylase kinase), but it does activate sarcolemmal l-type Ca2+channels (10Zhou Y.Y.

Res. 1993; 73: 286-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), suggesting that β2-AR signaling is localized. More direct evidence supporting the localized β2-AR signaling has emerged from singlel-type Ca2+ channel recordings. Employing cell-attached patch clamp technique, the activity of singlel-type Ca2+ channels has been measured in response to specific β-AR subtype agonist outside (remote) or inside (local) the patch pipette. In contrast to the diffusive effect of β1-AR stimulation, β2-AR stimulation by zinterol only locally activates the l-type Ca2+channel but has no remote effect (13Chen-Izu Y. Xiao R.P. Spurgeon H. Lakatta E.G. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30 (abstr.): 502Google Scholar). Taken together, these previous studies have led to the hypothesis that the β2-AR-induced cAMP signaling is compartmentalized to a subsarcolemmal space and cannot be transmitted to cytoplasmic and SR PKA target proteins. Alternatively, the signal is transmitted to cytosolic proteins but local inactivation occurs at these sites. The mechanism for the local control of β2-AR mediated signaling remains unclear. In many biological systems, Gsand Gi proteins cross-talk and operate as a complementary system. This balance system is usually regulated through different receptor families. For instance, activation of muscarinic receptors or adenosine receptors, prototypic Gi-coupled receptors, markedly antagonizes the positive inotropic effect of β-AR stimulation (14Levy M.N. Martin P.J. Stuesse S.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1981; 43: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Endoh M. Yamashita S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1980; 65: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, promiscuous G protein coupling of β2-AR to both Gs and PTX-sensitive G proteins (Gi2 and Gi3) has been demonstrated in intact cardiomyocytes (16Xiao R.P. Avdonin P. Zhou Y.Y. Cheng H.

Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This coupling of β2-AR to Gi proteins and its downstream pathway might interplay with the β2-AR/Gs signaling and contribute to the localization of β2-AR signaling near the sarcolemmal membrane. Thus, in the present study, we intended to determine whether the localized β2-AR signaling is mediated by the additional coupling of β2-AR to Gi proteins and, if so, to elucidate potential underlying mechanisms. Single ventricular myocytes were isolated from rat hearts by a standard enzymatic technique (18Spurgeon H.A. Stern M.D. Baartz G. Raffaeli S. Hansford R.G. Talo A. Lakatta E.G. Capogrossi M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: H574-H586PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were suspended in HEPES pH 7.4 buffer containing (in mmol/liter) 20 HEPES, 1 CaCl2, 137 NaCl, 5 KCl, 15 dextrose, 1.3 MgSO4, 1.2 NaH2PO4. In some experiments, cells were separately or simultaneously treated with 1.5 μg/ml PTX (Sigma) for 3 h at 37 °C to block Gi protein activation (15Endoh M. Yamashita S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1980; 65: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or 3 × 10−8m calyculin A (Calbiochem) for 20 min at 23 °C to inhibit protein phosphatases. Cells were stimulated at 0.5 Hz at 23 °C, and cell length was monitored from the bright-field image by an optical edge-tracking method using a photodiode array (model 1024 SAQ, Reticon) with a 3-ms time resolution (18Spurgeon H.A. Stern M.D. Baartz G. Raffaeli S. Hansford R.G. Talo A. Lakatta E.G. Capogrossi M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: H574-H586PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell L-type Ca2+ current (ICa) was measured via patch clamp technique using an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc.) (12Xiao R.P. Lakatta E.G. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 286-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To activate ICa selectively, cells were voltage-clamped at −40 mV to inactivate Na+ and T-type Ca2+ channels. K+ currents were inhibited by 4 mmol/liter 4-aminopyridine and 5.4 mmol/liter CsCl instead of KCl in the HEPES buffer and the pipette solution containing (mmol/liter) CsCl 100, NaCl 10, tetraethanolamine Cl 20, HEPES 10, MgATP 5, EGTA 5, pH 7.2, adjusted with CsOH. ICa was elicited by 300-ms pulses from a holding potential of −40 to 0 mV at 0.5 Hz at 23 °C. ICa was measured as the difference between the current at the peak and the end of the 300-ms pulse. The detection of site-specific PLB phosphorylation was performed as described recently (11Kuschel M. Zhou Y.Y. Spurgeon H.A. Bartel S. Karczewski P. Zhang S.J. Krause E.G. Lakatta E.G. Xiao R.P. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2458-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, cardiomyocytes were treated for 10 min with specific β-AR subtype agonists as indicated and solubilized prior to electrophoresis at 95 °C for 5 min to dissociate fully PLB into its monomeric form. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Serva), which was probed with the phosphorylation site-specific Ser16 PLB antibody (PhosphoProtein Research). Following incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Dianova), the immunoreaction was detected with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantified with a video documentation system (Bio-Rad). The activation of PKA in soluble and particulate fractions was analyzed by a modified method of Murrayet al. (19Murray K.J. England P.J. Lynham J.A. Mills D. Schmitz-Pfeiffer C. Reeves M. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Rat cardiomyocytes were homogenized and centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was taken to represent the soluble protein kinase activity and the resuspended pellet, the particulate fraction. The PKA activity is expressed as the activity ratio of malantide (Bachem)32P incorporation in the absence and presence of cAMP (2.8 μmol/liter). Results are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test or analysis of variance when appropriate. Values with p< 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. The β2-AR agonist, zinterol (10−5m), increased the whole cell l-type Ca2+ current (ICa) to 161 ± 8.8% (n = 7, p < 0.05) of control in single rat cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1a), which was completely abolished by the β2-AR antagonist ICI 118,551 (10Zhou Y.Y.

To delineate a role of cAMP-dependent PKA activation in the modulation of l-type Ca2+channels, an inhibitory cAMP analog, (Rp)-cAMPs (10Zhou Y.Y. Cheng H. Bogdanov K.Y. Hohl C. Altschuld R. Lakatta E.G. Xiao R.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1611-H1618PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kuschel M. Zhou Y.Y. Spurgeon H.A. Bartel S. Karczewski P. Zhang S.J. Krause E.G. Lakatta E.G. Xiao R.P.

In the presence of (Rp)-cAMPs (10−4m) zinterol failed to augment ICa (Fig. 1b), indicating that the cAMP-dependent PKA activation is obligatory for β2-AR-mediated modulation ofl-type Ca2+ channels. PLB, the main modulator of cardiac relaxation, is phosphorylated following cardiac β1-AR stimulation at two adjacent phosphorylation sites, Ser16 (Fig. 2a) and Thr17, catalyzed by PKA and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase, respectively (3Wegener A.D.

In contrast, the β2-AR agonist, zinterol, even at a maximal concentration (10−5m for 10 min), had only a very minor effect on the PKA-mediated Ser16 phosphorylation of PLB, as detected with phosphorylation site-specific PLB antibodies (21Drago G.A. Colyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25073-25077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the Western blot (Fig. 2, a and b). The dose-response relation and the time course of Ser16 PLB phosphorylation are shown in Fig. 2b and Fig. 3c, respectively. A maximal concentration (10−5m) of the β2-AR agonist, zinterol, only induced a minor increase in Ser16 PLB phosphorylation even if the incubation time was extended to 20 min (Fig. 3c). Concomitantly, the β2-AR-mediated increase in contractility occurred in the absence of a significant relaxant effect (Fig. 3a). Thus, the failure of β2-AR stimulation to induce PLB phosphorylation is the apparent mechanism for the absence of a lusitropic effect (Fig. 3c). These data illustrate that whereas both β1- and β2-AR share the common second messenger cAMP, they exhibit differences with respect to PKA-mediated protein phosphorylation and relaxant effects (8Xiao R.P.

Avdonin P. Zhou Y.Y. Cheng H. Akhter S.A. Eschenhagen T. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Lakatta E.G. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 17Xiao R.P. Ji X. Lakatta E.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the additional coupling of β2-AR to Gimight interfere with the β2-AR/Gs signaling, contributing to the restriction of β2-AR-mediated cAMP signaling to a subsarcolemmal domain. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of Gi protein inhibition by PTX on the PLB phosphorylation following β2-AR stimulation and its functional consequences. Whereas PTX itself had only a negligible effect on the basal Ser16 PLB phosphorylation (Fig. 2b), β2-AR stimulation with zinterol in PTX-treated cardiomyocytes markedly increased PLB phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 = 48.6 ± 1.8 nm) (Fig. 2b), with a maximal increase of 6.5-fold, comparable with that induced by the β1-AR agonist norepinephrine (NE at 10−7m) (37.9 ± 4.7 and 36.7 ± 7.7 in arbitrary units, respectively). Fig. 3a shows the time courses of β2-AR effects on contraction amplitude and duration (t½) in both PTX-treated and non-treated cells. In addition to the 1.5-fold potentiation of the β2-AR inotropic response, inhibition of Gi function allowed zinterol to induce a de novo relaxant effect in rat cardiomyocytes. The β2-AR-induced lusitropic effect in PTX-treated cells is highly comparable with that of β1-AR stimulation in control cells (Fig. 3, a and b). Furthermore, the time course of the β2-AR-induced Ser16 PLB phosphorylation was tightly correlated to the time course of the relaxant effect in PTX-treated cardiomyocytes, both reaching a steady state within 5 min (Fig. 3c). In contrast, neither the β1-AR-mediated contractile nor its relaxant response was affected by PTX (Fig. 3b). These results strongly suggest that the β2-AR/Gi coupling functionally compartmentalizes the β2-AR/Gs-mediated cAMP signaling, altering the quality as well as the magnitude of its cellular response. To elucidate further the mechanism underlying the Gi-mediated spatial control of β2-AR signaling, we measured the PKA activity following β-AR subtype stimulation. Similar to β1-AR stimulation, β2-AR activation also significantly increased the PKA activity ratio in both soluble and particulate fractions (Fig. 4). This suggests that, unlike β1-AR, β2-AR-mediated increases in cAMP accumulation (8Xiao R.P. Hohl C. Altschuld R. Jones L. Livingston B. Ziman B. Tantini B. Lakatta E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19151-19156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zhou Y.Y. Cheng H. Bogdanov K.Y. Hohl C. Altschuld R. Lakatta E.G. Xiao R.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1611-H1618PubMed Google Scholar) and PKA activation (Fig. 4a) are dissociated from Ser16 PLB phosphorylation (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, PTX did not significantly affect the response of PKA in either fraction (Fig. 4), suggesting that the cross-talk of Gs and Gi signaling following β2-AR stimulation may occur downstream of PKA (see “Discussion”). We therefore examined the potential involvement of protein phosphatases in β2-AR-mediated Gisignaling. Rat cardiomyocytes were treated with calyculin A (3 × 10−8m) for 20 min to inhibit protein phosphatases. Control experiments showed that calyculin A at this concentration had only a marginal effect on contraction amplitude (127.1 ± 18.6% of control, n = 4), but induced a time- and dose-dependent augmentation in contraction at higher concentrations (data not shown). Interestingly, preincubation of cells with calyculin A at this near-threshold concentration markedly and selectively potentiated the submaximal contractile response to the β2-AR agonist zinterol (10−6m), whereas it had no effect on the submaximal β1-AR (NE, 10−8m)-stimulated contractile response (Fig. 5). Thus, the effects of protein phosphatase inhibition are similar to that of Gi inhibition by PTX, enhancing the contractile response in a β2-AR-specific manner (Fig. 3). This result strongly suggests that protein phosphatases are likely to be involved in the β2-AR/Gi-directed signaling. This conclusion was further substantiated by the observation that calyculin A failed to potentiate further the β2-AR-mediated contractile response if the Gi pathway is disrupted by PTX treatment (Fig. 5). Therefore, protein phosphatases may serve as a key element of the β2-AR-coupled Gi signaling cascade to spatially control the Gs-mediated cAMP/PKA signaling.Figure 5Involvement of protein phosphatases in the localization of β2-AR signaling. The protein phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A (CalA, 3 × 10−8m), selectively potentiates the β2-AR agonist zinterol (Zin, 10−6m)-induced inotropic effect but has no further potentiating effect on the β2-AR contractile response in the presence of PTX pretreatment. The data (mean ± S.E., n = 7–19, *p < 0.05 versus zinterol) are expressed as percent change from values recorded before the application of the β-AR agonist. Base-line contractility is 5.98 ± 0.38 (n = 37), 5.20 ± 0.41 (n = 21), 5.04 ± 0.26 (n = 7), and 4.28 ± 0.48% (n = 7) of cell rest length for untreated, calyculin A-treated, PTX-treated, and PTX plus calyculin A-treated cells, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Recent advances in β2-AR signaling have provided evidence for a novel subcellular compartmentalization of cAMP signaling. Specifically, although both β1- and β2-AR stimulation enhance cAMP accumulation (8Xiao R.P. Hohl C. Altschuld R. Jones L. Livingston B. Ziman B. Tantini B. Lakatta E.G. J. Biol.

This indicates that the signaling may be highly localized to sarcolemmal microdomains or that it can be transmitted to cytoplasmic sites but locally inactivated there. The key question then is what mechanism enforces the tight spatial control of β2-AR-mediated cAMP signaling. In principle, a localized cAMP signaling could arise from localization of signaling components,e.g. localization of cAMP by phosphodiesterases (22Jurevicius J. Fischmeister R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 23Hohl C.M. Li Q.A. Circ.

A close spatial association of Ca2+ channels with adenylyl cyclase and PKA (26Gray P.C. Johnson B.D. Westenbroek R.E. Hayes L.G. Yates J.R. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Murphy B.J.

However, since both cAMP and catalytic subunits of PKA (released following activation) are diffusive molecules, additional mechanisms should be involved to restrict actively their signaling to certain subcellular domains. In the present study, we demonstrated that, apart from localization of signaling molecules of the cAMP/PKA cascade (22Jurevicius J. Fischmeister R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 23Hohl C.M. Li Q.A. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 1369-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 24Dell'Acqua M.L. Scott J.D. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), an interaction between functionally opposing signal transduction pathways can also create compartmentalization of receptor-mediated signaling. In particular, following inhibition of Gi function by PTX treatment, β2-AR stimulation markedly increased Ser16 PLB phosphorylation and elicited a de novolusitropic effect in rat ventricular myocytes, which is highly comparable with that following β1-AR stimulation. Thus, inhibition of Gi proteins converts the β2-AR signaling mode to that of β1-AR-like signaling. These results strongly suggest that the β2-AR/Gicoupling effectively compartmentalizes the β2-AR/Gs-mediated cAMP signaling, altering not only the magnitude but also the quality of its cardiac response. It is well established that activation of protein phosphatases functionally counterbalances cellular effects of protein kinases. Recently, it has been reported that the inhibitory effect of the Gi protein-coupled muscarinic receptor stimulation on the β-AR-induced cAMP signaling is largely mediated by activation of protein phosphatases (28Herzig S. Meier A. Pfeiffer M. Neumann J. Pfluegers Arch. 1995; 429: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, angiotensin II increases protein phosphatase 2A activity in cultured neurons through a Gi protein-dependent mechanism (29Huang X.C. Richards E.M. Sumners C. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2131-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the potential involvement of protein phosphatases in the cross-talk of the β2-AR-stimulated Gs/Gi signaling. Interestingly, calyculin A, a non-selective protein phosphatase inhibitor, mimics the PTX effect. Both interventions, Gi inhibition by PTX or protein phosphatase inhibition by calyculin A, had a non-additive potentiating effect on β2-AR-mediated contractile response when applied together, suggesting that PTX and calyculin A act on a common signaling pathway. Therefore, the negating and spatial restricting effects of β2-AR-activated Gi proteins on the Gs-directed signaling might be mediated by a modulation of the protein phosphatase/kinase balance. For instance, a high dephosphorylation rate of non-sarcolemmal proteins following β2-AR stimulation might negate the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of PLB (and other cytoplasmic proteins). β2-AR-mediated Gi protein activation could either directly modulate protein phosphatase activity or inhibit PKA activation at subcellular compartments and secondarily modulate the protein phosphatase inhibitor 1 and therefore protein phosphatase activity (7Neumann J. Gupta R.C. Schmitz W. Scholz H. Nairn A.C. Watanabe A.M. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In other words, the Gi protein activation could negate the β2-AR/Gs-mediated PKA activation in certain subcellular microdomains, resulting in a higher protein phosphatase activity and a lower protein phosphorylation in those subcellular microdomains, which is functionally indistinguishable from a Gi-mediated direct activation of protein phosphatases. Previous studies in frog and canine hearts have provided evidence for the involvement of phosphodiesterases in the compartmentalization of β-AR signaling (22Jurevicius J. Fischmeister R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 23Hohl C.M. Li Q.A. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 1369-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, our previous studies have demonstrated that PTX treatment has no significant effect on β2-AR-mediated global cAMP accumulation (10Zhou Y.Y. Cheng H. Bogdanov K.Y. Hohl C. Altschuld R. Lakatta E.G. Xiao R.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1611-H1618PubMed Google Scholar). The present results show further that β2-AR-stimulated increase in PKA activity in two different subcellular fractions is insensitive to PTX. Although the non-additive effect of protein phosphatase and Gi protein inhibition suggests, but does not prove, that β2-AR stimulation is modulating protein phosphatase activity through a PKA-independent pathway, these standard measures of global cAMP levels and PKA activity in cardiomyocytes provide no insight into the highly localized signaling. Although we are unable to distinguish if β2-AR/Gi signaling modulates protein phosphatases PKA-independent or -dependent due to technical limitation, the present results strongly suggest that protein phosphatases are critically involved in the β2-AR/Gi signaling, contributing to the functional compartmentalization of the β2-AR/Gs signaling in rat ventricular myocytes. It is noteworthy that the β2-AR-mediated cardiac response and the extent of the Gi protein coupling may vary substantially among species, resulting in an enormous diversity in cardiac β2-AR-mediated responses and its sensitivity to PTX. In mouse cardiomyocytes β2-ARs are not functional unless Gi function is inhibited by PTX treatment, indicating a high level of Gi protein coupling (16Xiao R.P. Avdonin P. Zhou Y.Y. Cheng H. Akhter S.A. Eschenhagen T. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Lakatta E.G. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In contrast, β2-AR stimulation does induce positive inotropic and lusitropic effects as well as phosphorylation of regulatory proteins in the failing human heart (30Kaumann A.J. Sanders L. Lynham J.A. Bartel S. Kuschel M. Karczewski P. Krause E.G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 163–164: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 31Kaumann A.J. Bartel S. Molenaar P. Sanders L. Burrell K. Vetter D. Hempel P. Karczewski P. Krause E.G. Circulation. 1999; 99: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Between these extremes, β2-AR stimulation in rat cardiomyocytes induces significant increases in ICa and contractility in the absence of phosphorylation of cytoplasmic regulatory proteins. PTX treatment further enhances the β2-AR contractile response (17Xiao R.P. Ji X. Lakatta E.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and restores its ability to phosphorylate cytoplasmic regulatory proteins in this species. The situation in canine myocytes is similar to that of rat myocytes, except that β2-AR does induce lusitropic as well as inotropic effects in the absence of cytoplasmic protein phosphorylation (9Altschuld R.A.

The aforementioned data also illustrate that the same signaling molecule, cAMP, mediates remarkably different cardiac functional responses following β1- and β2-AR stimulation (8Xiao R.P. Hohl C.

Res. 1993; 73: 286-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Analogously, it has been shown that intracellular Ca2+ located in different subcellular compartments may mediate distinctly different and sometimes even opposing cellular functions. For instance, a global elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ in arterial smooth muscle cells causes vasoconstriction, but Ca2+ sparks near the sarcolemma induce relaxation (32Nelson M.T. Cheng H. Rubart M. Santana L.F. Bonev A.D. Knot H.J. Lederer W.J. Science. 1995; 270: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). In this case, local Ca2+ gradients are possible, because various endogenous binding sites buffer Ca2+ of discrete origins. Thus, physical or functional compartmentalization of ubiquitous intracellular messengers, such as cAMP and Ca2+, creates specificity and diversity of a given receptor-mediated signaling. In summary, we have demonstrated that, in addition to the potentiation of the inotropic response, inhibition of Gi function by PTX induces a de novo lusitropic effect and PLB phosphorylation following β2-AR stimulation in rat ventricular myocytes. These results suggest a contribution of β2-AR/Gi-coupled signaling to the compartmentalization of β2-AR/Gs-stimulated cAMP/PKA signaling, possibly through a protein phosphatase-dependent mechanism. In addition, the present study demonstrates that compartmentalization of a common second messenger-directed signaling allows for selective modulation of a variety of target proteins and cellular processes, creating signaling specificity and versatility among closely related G protein-coupled receptors."

The molecular mechanisms implicated in this action of fatty acids remain poorly understood.

Thus far, the role of PPARδ in the control of adipose tissue mass has remained unclear. Herein, we report the effects of ectopically expressed PPARδ on the control of adipose-related gene expression and adipogenesis of 3T3C2 fibroblasts. Treatment of PPARδ-expressing fibroblasts with fatty acids alone did not stimulate adipogenesis, whereas exposure of cells to a combination of fatty acids and PPARγ activators promoted lipid accumulation and expression of a typical adipocyte program. At the molecular level, activation of PPARδ by fatty acids induced transcription of the genes encoding fatty acid transporter, adipocyte lipid-binding protein, and PPARγ. Subsequent activation of PPARγ by specific agonists appeared to be required to promote terminal differentiation.

Fatty acids have been suggested to regulate adaptation to nutritional changes. In vivo studies have illustrated the effect of high fat diets on the development of obesity. In adult animals, high fat feeding leads to the appearance of new fat cells due to proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes (1Faust I.M. Johnson P.R. Stern J.S. Hirsch J. Am. J.

Ailhaud G. Grimaldi P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 930-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This adipogenic action of LCFAs was likely related to a direct effect of the molecule rather than increased substrate availability, as bromopalmitate, a non-metabolized derivative of palmitate (5Grimaldi P.A. Knobel S.M. Whitesell R.R. Abumrad N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10930-10934Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), was found to be more active than native LCFAs. Furthermore, the adipogenic action of LCFAs is restricted to a critical period, corresponding to the preadipose state, whereas LCFA treatment of terminally differentiating cells is without effect (4Amri E.Z. Ailhaud G. Grimaldi P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 930-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular effects of fatty acids and some of their metabolites are related, at least in part, to activation of transcription factors called PPARs that regulate the expression of genes directly implicated in lipid metabolism in various tissues including liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. PPARs exert their effects by binding to a specific responsive DNA element, called peroxisome proliferator responsive element after heterodimerization with retinoid X receptors (6Green S. Wahli W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 7Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M.

Three different PPAR subtypes have been described, and their differential distribution suggests that they have specific roles in different organs. PPARα, mainly expressed in liver and brown adipose tissue, plays an important role in fatty acid catabolism (9Lee S.S.T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Wesphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). PPARγ, predominantly expressed in adipose cells, in combination with other transcription factors plays a crucial role in activation of genes of the adipose differentiation program and adipogenesis (10Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). PPARδ displays a high level of expression in lipid-metabolizing tissues, such as adipose tissue, small intestine, heart, and skeletal muscle and could regulate the expression of genes implicated in fatty acid uptake and activation. This is supported by transfection experiments demonstrating that its ectopic expression in fibroblasts confers fatty acid responsiveness to FAT, ALBP, and acyl-CoA synthetase genes (11Amri E.Z.

Naturally occurring and synthetic molecules that are ligands for these nuclear receptors control transcriptional activity of PPARs. Some compounds, such as carbacyclin, do not show any isoform specificity (12Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M.

Thiazolidinediones and 15-deoxy-Δ12–14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) have been identified as specific PPARγ ligands and activators (15Lehman J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M.

Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4653-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). PPARδ is activated by LCFAs, including non-metabolized analogs such as bromopalmitate (11Amri E.Z. Bonino F. Ailhaud G. Abumrad N.A. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2367-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). PPARδ and γ isoforms are up-regulated during adipose differentiation with distinct time courses. PPARδ is expressed during the initial steps of the differentiation process, whereas PPARγ is expressed during terminal differentiation (11Amri E.Z. Bonino F. Ailhaud G. Abumrad N.A. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2367-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 18Chawla A. Schwarz E.J. Dimaculangan D.D. Lazar M.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 798Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Expression of PPARγ promotes adipogenesis in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts exposed to strong specific activators (19Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar), whereas expression of PPARδ and its activation by fatty acids is not sufficient to induce lipid accumulation in the same cells (12Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). However, circumstantial evidence argues against the sole and direct involvement of PPARγ in the adipogenic action of fatty acids and favors a role for PPARδ. First, it has been shown that PPARγ is not directly activated by fatty acids (20Kliewer S.A. Forman B.M. Blumberg B. Ong E.S. Borgmeyer U. Mangeldorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar), whereas LCFAs are strong activators of PPARδ (11Amri E.Z. Bonino F. Ailhaud G. Abumrad N.A. Grimaldi P.A.

A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). Second, PPARγ is expressed at very low levels in preadipose cells,i.e. during the critical period when LCFAs exert their adipogenic action (4Amri E.Z. Ailhaud G. Grimaldi P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 930-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Amri E.Z. Bonino F. Ailhaud G. Abumrad N.A. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2367-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Finally, fatty acids promote adipose conversion of calvaria-derived osteoblasts or osteoma clonal cells that express PPARδ but not PPARα and PPARγ (22Diascro D.D. Vogel R.L. Johnson T.E. Whirtherup K.M. Pitzenberger S.M. Rutledge S.J. Prescott D.J. Rodan G.A. Schmidt A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To delineate more precisely the potential role of PPARδ in the control of fatty acid-induced adipogenesis, we have forced its expression in 3T3C2 fibroblasts, which are normally totally refractory to adipose differentiation (23Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1974; 1: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (735) Google Scholar), and we examined their response to LCFAs and various PPAR activators used alone or in combination. We found that expression of PPARδ in fibroblasts is capable of promoting adipose differentiation in response to treatment by combination of PPARδ and PPARγ activators. Investigation at the molecular level has revealed that activation by LCFAs of ectopically expressed PPARδ leads to induction of endogenous PPARγ and that, in turn, activation of the latter by its specific agonists promotes adipogenesis. The retroviral construct containing PPARδ cDNA was derived from pSG5-FAAR (11Amri E.Z. Bonino F. Ailhaud G. Abumrad N.A. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2367-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and cloned into theBamHI site of pBizeoneo (Dr. K. Kristiansen, University of Odense, Denmark). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (standard medium). For differentiation, cells were shifted to standard medium supplemented with 1 nm insulin and 1 nm triiodothyronine (standard differentiation medium). For experiments in serum-free medium, cells were first inoculated in standard medium at a density of 103 cells/cm2 and washed 24 h later with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 (50:50). Cells were grown to confluence in 4-F medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 supplemented with insulin (5 μg/ml), transferrin (10 μg/ml), fetuin (0.5 μg/ml), and fibroblast growth factor (25 ng/ml). At confluence, cells were shifted to the same medium without fibroblast growth factor and supplemented with growth hormone (2 nm) and triiodothyronine (0.2 nm) (referred to as 5F medium). Medium was changed every other day. BOSC23 cells were transfected at 50–70% confluence by lipofection (DOTAP, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 1 μg of pBizeoneo or pBizeoneoPPARδ expression vector. After 8 h, cells were refed with fresh standard medium, and viral supernatants were collected 48 h later. 3T3C2 cells maintained in standard medium were infected with equal titers of recombinant virus for 6 h. Cells were maintained for 48 h in fresh medium and then replated with a 1:10 dilution in standard medium containing 0.4 mg/ml geneticin. Stable cell populations were obtained after 7–10 days of selection. After confluence, cells were maintained in standard differentiation medium with or without various inducers. Fatty acids, bromopalmitate, and BRL 49653 were dissolved in Me2SO, carbacyclin in ethanol, and 15d-PGJ2 in ethyl acetate. Red Oil O staining was performed as described previously (23Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1974; 1: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared and analyzed by Northern blot as described previously (4Amri E.Z. Ailhaud G. Grimaldi P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 930-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were subjected to digital imaging (FujixBAS 1000). GAPDH mRNA, which is constitutively expressed and not affected by adipocyte differentiation, was monitored as internal standard. Glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity, which provides the glycerol 3-phosphate required for triglyceride synthesis and induced during adipocyte differentiation, was assayed spectrophotometrically as described previously (24Grimaldi P. Djian P. Negrel R. Ailhaud G. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was expressed in milliunit,i.e. nanomole of product formed per min/mg of protein. Protein content of samples was determined according to Lowry et al. (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Nuclear extracts were prepared from virally infected 3T3C2 cell lines as described (26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1575-1579Crossref Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). The extracts were separated on 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes. PPARδ protein was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the A/B domain of mouse PPARδ. Immunodetection was performed with ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Culture media, fetal calf serum, and geneticin were from Life Technologies, Inc. (France). Eicosanoids were obtained from Cayman Chemical. Other chemical products were purchased from Sigma and Aldrich (France). Radioactive materials, random priming kit, and nylon membranes were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (France). BRL 49653 was a kind gift from Smithkline Beecham (United Kingdom). To explore the potential action of PPARδ in promoting fatty acid responsiveness, the mouse PPARδ coding sequence was expressed in Swiss 3T3C2 fibroblasts by retroviral infection using the pBizeoneo vector. This vector contains an internal ribosome entry site from the encephalomyocarditis virus that allows transcription of a same RNA transcript encoding both PPARδ and neomycin gene products. Transcription of this bicistronic RNA is driven from the Moloney murine leukemia virus long term repeat. As shown in Fig. 1A, 3T3C2Biz,i.e. infected with the empty original pBizeoneo vector, expressed a low, but significant, level of PPARδ mRNA at the expected size of 3.5 kilobase pairs. In two independent 3T3C2BizPPARδ cell populations, i.e. infected with the retroviral vector containing the PPARδ-coding sequence, the viral transcript (about 5 kilobase pairs) is considerably better expressed than the endogenous PPARδ mRNA. Western blot analysis shown in Fig. 1Brevealed a faint PPARδ signal in nuclear extracts from the control 3T3C2Biz cells. The signals detected in nuclear extracts from two independent retrovirally infected 3T3C2BizPPARδ cell populations were considerably more intense and nearly similar to that detected in nuclear extract from differentiated Ob1771 cells. Further experiments showed that the amount of PPARδ protein remains unchanged in 3T3C2BizPPARδ cells for 1 week after confluence whatever the culture condition (not shown). To confirm that the PPARδ protein expressed in 3T3C2BizPPARδ cells is functional, we investigated the response of these cells to short term exposure to various compounds described as PPAR agonists. 3T3C2BizPPARδ and 3T3C2Biz cells were grown to confluence and exposed for 24 h to the various activators either in the presence (Fig. 2, A and B) or absence (Fig. 2C) of serum. As shown in Fig. 2A, 3T3C2BizPPARδ cells maintained in standard medium do not express FAT or ALBP mRNA. Exposure to the thiazolidinedione BRL 49653, a selective PPARγ agonist, to clofibrate or Wy 14,643, selective PPARα agonists, or to bromooctanoate, a middle chain fatty acid, are without effect on FAT and ALBP gene expression. By contrast, treatments with long chain fatty acids, such as palmitate, oleate, or bromopalmitate, induce a strong expression of FAT and ALBP genes. The effects of long chain fatty acids are confined to PPARδ-expressing cells as 3T3C2Biz cells remain insensitive to such treatments (Fig. 2A, lower panel) and are dose-dependent in 3T3C2BizPPARδ cells as illustrated in Fig. 2B. Bromopalmitate, a non-metabolized LCFA, is more active than linolenate. To investigate further the selectivity of the process of FAT mRNA induction by PPARδ activation, 3T3C2BizPPARδ cells were maintained in serum-free medium with or without the PPAR pan-activator cPGI2 or a specific PPARγ ligand, 15d-PGJ2. As shown in Fig. 2C, cPGI2 activates FAT mRNA expression at low concentrations (73% of maximal effect for 30 nm), whereas 15d-PGJ2 is completely inactive whatever the concentration used. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that 3T3C2BizPPARδ cells are responsive to compounds already described as PPARδ activators, whereas selective activators of either PPARα or PPARγ are without effect. To examine whether or not ectopic expression of PPARδ promoted lipid accumulation in fibroblasts, 3T3C2BizPPARδ and 3T3C2Biz cells were cultured after confluence in standard differentiation medium supplemented with various PPAR activators. After 8 days, cells were fixed and stained for accumulated lipid with Oil Red O. As expected, no lipid accumulation was detected in control 3T3C2Biz cells regardless of the activator or combination of activators used (Fig. 3, lower panel). A similar lack of differentiation was found for 3T3C2BizPPARδ cells maintained in control medium with or without 1 μm BRL 49653. Exposure of post-confluent 3T3C2 cells to bromopalmitate or linolenate resulted in cell death after day 5. However, treatment from day 0 to day 4 post-confluence was not toxic and led to a very faint staining due to limited lipid accumulation. A strong staining was observed in cells exposed to a mixture of linolenate or bromopalmitate (for the 1st 4 days) and 1 μm BRL 49653. Microscopic examination of 3T3C2BizPPARδ cells confirmed these observations as no lipid accumulation was seen in cells maintained in standard differentiation medium (SDM) or treated with BRL 49653 alone (Fig. 4A). Exposure to α-linolenate or bromopalmitate failed to promote lipid droplet appearance except in less than 1% of the cells. Treatment of the cells with a combination of LCFA (days 0–4) and BRL 49653 (days 0–8) led to a classical morphology of cultured adipocytes. The effects of prostaglandins activating both PPARδ and PPARγ, i.e.cPGI2, or specifically PPARγ, i.e. 15d-PGJ2, have been studied in cells maintained in serum-free medium already used to study the control of Ob1771 differentiation by prostaglandins (27Gaillard D. Negrel R. Lagarde M. Ailhaud G. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, 3T3C2BizPPARδ cells did not accumulate lipids when maintained for 8 days post-confluence in 5F medium. Chronic exposure to cPGI2 promoted lipid accumulation in about 50% of the cells, whereas treatment with 15d-PGJ2 failed to promote adipogenesis. 3T3C2Biz did not accumulate lipid under all culture conditions tested (not shown). To confirm that lipid accumulation occurring in 3T3C2BizPPARδ cells in certain conditions was related to an actual differentiation process, GPDH activity, an indicator of terminal differentiation, was determined (Fig. 5A). No GPDH activity was detected in cells maintained for 8 days post-confluence in 5F medium. Chronic exposure to cPGI2 resulted in a dose-dependent activation of GPDH expression. This adipogenic action of cPGI2 took place at very low concentrations and reached a plateau at 500 nm. In the same culture conditions, 3T3C2Biz cells remained completely insensitive to the compound in terms of GPDH induction (not shown). 15d-PGJ2 and PGD2, its metabolic precursor, were unable to induce GPDH expression in 3T3C2BizPPARδ cells. GPDH induction was next investigated in cells maintained in SDM for 8 days post-confluence and exposed for various periods to bromopalmitate, to BRL 49653, or to a combination of both compounds (Fig. 5B). Consistent with the morphological observations of Fig. 4A, no GPDH activity was detected in cells maintained in SDM for 8 days or exposed to 25 μm bromopalmitate or to 1 μm BRL 49653 for various times. In contrast, cells exposed for the 1st 4 days to bromopalmitate and chronically treated by BRL 49653 expressed a high level of GPDH activity. Chronic treatment with BRL 49653 was not required since cells exposed first to bromopalmitate (days 0–4) and then to the thiazolidinedione (days 4–8) also expressed high GPDH activity. By contrast, the adipose marker remained undetectable in cells treated first with BRL 49653 (days 0–4) and then with bromopalmitate (days 4–8). Altogether, these observations indicated that ectopic PPARδ expression promotes adipogenesis in fibroblasts, but this requires exposure to both PPARδ and PPARγ activators, whereas treatments with activators of either PPARδ or PPARγ are not sufficient to induce GPDH expression and lipid accumulation. These results also suggest that ectopic expression of PPARδ in 3T3C2 fibroblasts and its activation by fatty acids confer responsiveness to thiazolidinedione treatment, which in turn induces both GPDH expression and lipid accumulation. To characterize the differentiation phenotype of the cells at the molecular level, the level of expression of genes encoding adipose markers, including PPARγ, was analyzed by Northern blot for cells maintained for 8 days post-confluence in various conditions (Fig. 6A). Cells maintained in SDM, or treated with 1 μm BRL 49653, 100 μmclofibrate, or a combination of both compounds did not express detectable amounts of any mRNA related to adipose differentiation. Cells exposed for 4 days from confluence to either 25 μmbromopalmitate or 100 μm linolenate expressed relatively high signal for PPARγ mRNA and weak signals for ALBP and FAT mRNA. In these cells, GPDH mRNA remained undetectable. In good agreement with the previous data of this study, cells chronically treated with BRL 49653 and exposed for 4 days post-confluence to bromopalmitate or to linolenate express a high level of the complete panel of adipose markers including GPDH. In such conditions, the levels of FAT and ALBP mRNA expression were found to be similar to those of differentiated Ob1771 cells, whereas those of GPDH and PPARγ mRNA were 50 and 70%, respectively, of the signals found in differentiated cells. The dose dependence of bromopalmitate adipogenic action was next examined. For that purpose, cells were maintained for 8 days post-confluence in SDM supplemented with 1 μm BRL 49653 and exposed from confluence to day 4 to various concentrations of bromopalmitate (Fig. 6B). Northern blot analysis revealed that the bromopalmitate effect on the expression of mRNA for PPARγ, ALBP, and GPDH took place between 5 and 50 μm. Adipose marker mRNAs remained undetectable in 3T3C2Biz cells under all culture conditions. The time course of adipose-related mRNAs was next examined in 3T3C2BizPPARδ cells exposed to bromopalmitate for the 1st 4 days in the presence (Fig. 7A) or absence (Fig. 7B) of BRL 49653. PPARγ mRNA emerged at day 4 and accumulated thereafter to reach a maximum at day 8 in cells exposed to BRL 49653. The treatment with thiazolidinedione was not strictly required for PPARγ gene expression but led to an increased RNA level as cells maintained in the absence of BRL 49653 expressed about 60% of the maximal level observed in treated cells. The expression of GPDH mRNA appeared to be strictly dependent on exposure to the thiazolidinedione since no expression was detected in cells treated only with the fatty acid. In cells maintained in conditions permissive for terminal differentiation, GPDH induction occurred very late. The FAT gene expression pattern was found to be different as this mRNA emerged early after confluence and reached a maximal expression after 3 days of bromopalmitate treatment in cells maintained with or without BRL 49653. In both culture conditions, withdrawal of the fatty acid resulted in a rapid down-regulation of FAT mRNA that completely disappeared in cells maintained in SDM and was lately re-induced in cells exposed to BRL 49653. The knowledge of mechanisms implicated in the adaptation of adipose tissue to high fat feeding remains a critical issue. It is now established that PPARγ when activated by naturally occurring molecules, such as 15d-PGJ2, or drugs, such as thiazolidinediones, plays a crucial role in adipogenesis (10Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar, 28Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar, 29Mandrup S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5367-5370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The role of PPARδ that is expressed at relatively high levels in adipose tissue and emerges early during adipose differentiation had remained unclear. The findings of the present work support the idea that PPARδ could act as an early player in the induction by fatty acids of adipose cell commitment to differentiation. It has already been demonstrated that forced expression of PPARδ in fibroblasts confers fatty acid responsiveness to ALBP and FAT genes (11Amri E.Z. Bonino F. Ailhaud G. Abumrad N.A. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2367-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Consistent with these data, 3T3C2BizPPARδ cells, which express the nuclear receptor to levels closed to those found in differentiated adipocytes (Fig. 1), display a similar response to LCFAs. This biological response appeared to be primarily due to PPARδ activation as specific activators of either PPARγ, such as 15d-PGJ2 or BRL 49653, or PPARα, such as fibrates, are inactive (Fig. 2,A and C). Interestingly, FAT gene up-regulation occurred within low ranges of concentrations of bromopalmitate and higher concentrations of linolenate. In this respect, 3T3C2BizPPARδ cells are similar to Ob1771 preadipose cells in which it has been demonstrated that FAT and ALBP genes are rapidly induced by treatment with long chain fatty acids (30Amri E.Z. Bertrand B. Ailhaud G. Grimaldi P. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1449-1456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Amri E.Z. Ailhaud G. Grimaldi P. J.

Fatty Acids. 1997; 57: 17-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and that bromopalmitate exert more potent effects than native fatty acids (Ref. 5Grimaldi P.A. Knobel S.M. Whitesell R.R. Abumrad N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10930-10934Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar and Fig. 2B). The main goal of this work was to investigate the role of PPARδ on adipogenesis. It has been shown that PPARδ-expressing NIH3T3 fibroblasts do not undergo adipose differentiation upon treatment with bromopalmitate alone (12Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Our findings are not contradictory with these data, as exposure of 3T3C2BizPPARδ cells to linolenate or bromopalmitate alone does not promote lipid accumulation or GPDH induction (Figs. 3 and 4). Not surprisingly, in the absence of PPARγ expression (Fig. 6), exposure of the cells to specific activators of PPARγ alone also failed to induce terminal differentiation. However, several lines of evidence indicate that activation of both PPARδ and PPARγ promote adipogenesis and expression of a typical adipose differentiation program in 3T3BizPPARδ cells. This terminal differentiation can be attained by exposure of the cells to low concentrations of cPGI2, a strong PPAR pan-activator, whereas 15d-PGJ2 and its precursor PGD2 were ineffective. Notably, a similar response has been observed for Ob1771 preadipose cells in which cPGI2 exerted adipogenic action in the same range of concentrations, whereas 15d-PGJ2 and PGD2 were inactive (33Ailhaud G. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The relationship between PPARδ and PPARγ was shown, as exposure of 3T3C2BizPPARδ cells to either linolenate or bromopalmitate is sufficient to induce expression of the PPARγ gene. In sharp contrast, terminal differentiation requires PPARγ gene expression,i.e. as a result of PPARδ activation, and its subsequent activation by specific ligands such as thiazolidinediones. A similar strict requirement for PPARγ activators was already reported for terminal differentiation of PPARγ-expressing fibroblasts (19Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar). These observations illustrate a major difference between PPAR-expressing fibroblasts and actual preadipocytes that undergo terminal differentiation when maintained in standard medium suggesting that preadipocytes synthesize and accumulate natural PPARγ activators. PPARδ activation leads to FAT, ALBP, and PPARγ gene expression in 3T3C2BizPPARδ cells. However, time courses of FAT and PPARγ induction appeared different. FAT gene is rapidly induced during fatty acid treatment of 3T3C2BizPPARδ cells, is down-regulated after fatty acid withdrawal, and increased thereafter in cells exposed to thiazolidinedione (Figs. 2 and 7). From these findings it could be proposed that the first wave of FAT expression is under the control of PPARδ activated by fatty acids, whereas the second wave, which occurs only in cells exposed to thiazolidinedione, is under the control of endogenous ligand activated-PPARγ. A similar pattern of expression was observed for the ALBP gene (not shown). These transcriptional regulations probably imply association of PPARδ and PPARγ, respectively, activated by fatty acid and thiazolidinedione, to the PPAR-responsive elements identified in ALBP (34Ross S.R. Graves R.A. Greenstein A. Platt K.A. Shyu H.L. Mellovitz B. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9590-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and FAT (35Tontonoz P. Nagy L. Alvarez J.G.A. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar) gene promoters. The expression profile of PPARγ in response to PPARδ activation is clearly different. PPARγ mRNA emerged only after 3 or 4 days of fatty acid treatment and accumulated after fatty acid withdrawal, suggesting that transcription of the PPARγ gene does not require permanent activation of PPARδ. Taken together, these data do not favor a direct action of PPARδ on the PPARγ promoter and are more suggestive of an unidentified indirect mechanism. Molecular mechanisms regulating transcription of the PPARγ gene have been documented. It is clearly established that the gene is up-regulated during adipose differentiation and that C/EBPs play an important role in such process (29Mandrup S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5367-5370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Expression of C/EBPβ and δ into fibroblasts induces PPARγ to levels seen in adipocytes (36Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 37Wu Z. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A direct modulation of PPARγ2 promoter activity by C/EBPα and C/EBPδ was demonstrated by co-transfection studies, and two functional C/EBP recognition elements were identified in the mouse PPARγ2 promoter (38Clarke S.L. Robinson C.E. Gimble J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These observations and the findings of the present study illustrate the multiplicity of mechanisms underlying PPARγ gene expression. Such redundancy is not surprising since this transcription factor is a major actor in the regulation of the adipose tissue mass. Another feature of this paper is the demonstration that PPARδ and PPARγ play different roles in the regulation of adipose differentiation. Our data suggest that fatty acids selectively activate PPARδ leading to induction of certain adipose-related genes, such as FAT and PPARγ, but not to terminal differentiation that is under the control of ligand-activated PPARγ. From this model, it can be expected that selective PPARδ agonists should not act as insulin-sensitizing agents in obese diabetic animals since the high level of circulating fatty acids of such animals should maximally activate PPARδ. The recent observation that PPARδ-selective agonists, by opposition to PPARγ agonists, are not able to improve insulin sensitivity in obese, insulin-resistant db/db mice (39Berger J. Leibowitz M.D. Doebber T.W. Elbrecht A. Zhang B. Zhou G. Biswas C. Cullinan C.A. Hayes N.S. Li Y. Tanen M. Ventre J. Wu M.S. Berger G.D. Mosley R. Marquis R. Santini C. Sahoo S.P. Tolman R.L.

In conclusion, PPARδ appears to be the primary target of LCFAs and controls PPARγ gene expression. This nuclear receptor could act as an early actor in the increase of fat cell number occurring during high fat feeding and pathological states characterized by high concentrations of circulating fatty acids.

https://openalex.org/W2015750265,"Mechanisms by which differentiation programs engage the cell cycle are poorly understood. This study demonstrates that retinoids promote ubiquitination and degradation of cyclin D1 during retinoid-induced differentiation of human embryonal carcinoma cells. In response to all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) treatment, the human embryonal carcinoma cell line NT2/D1 exhibits a progressive decline in cyclin D1 expression beginning when the cells are committed to differentiate, but before onset of terminal neuronal differentiation. The decrease in cyclin D1 protein is tightly associated with the accumulation of hypophosphorylated forms of the retinoblastoma protein and G1 arrest. In contrast, retinoic acid receptor γ-deficient NT2/D1-R1 cells do not growth-arrest or accumulate in G1 and have persistent cyclin D1 overexpression despite RA treatment. Notably, stable transfection of retinoic acid receptor γ restores RA-mediated growth suppression and differentiation to NT2/D1-R1 cells and restores the decline of cyclin D1. The proteasome inhibitor LLnL blocks this RA-mediated decline in cyclin D1. RA treatment markedly accelerates ubiquitination of wild-type cyclin D1, but not a cyclin D1 (T286A) mutant. Transient expression of cyclin D1 (T286A) in NT2/D1 cells blocks RA-mediated transcriptional decline of a differentiation-sensitive reporter plasmid and represses induction of immunophenotypic neuronal markers. Taken together, these findings strongly implicate RA-mediated degradation of cyclin D1 as a means of coupling induced differentiation and cell cycle control of human embryonal carcinoma cells.

Taken together, these findings strongly implicate RA-mediated degradation of cyclin D1 as a means of coupling induced differentiation and cell cycle control of human embryonal carcinoma cells. The mechanisms coordinating the cell cycle and terminal differentiation have attracted intense interest (1Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Marks P.A. Pharmacol.

The current study proposes that signaled degradation of cyclin D1 is one mechanism linking RA-induced terminal differentiation and cell cycle control in human embryonal carcinoma cells. RA treatment of the pluripotent, human germ cell tumor-derived embryonal carcinoma cell line NT2/D1 signals growth suppression, reduced tumorigenicity, and morphologic and immunophenotypic neuronal differentiation (10Miller Jr., W.H. Maerz W.J. Kurie J.M. Moy D. Baselga J. Lucas D.A. Grippo J.F. Masui H. Dmitrovsky E. Differentiation. 1994; 55: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We previously reported the derivation of an RA-resistant NT2/D1 clone, NT2/D1-R1 (11Moasser M.M. Khoo K.-S. Maerz W.J. Zelenetz A. Dmitrovsky E. Differentiation. 1996; 60: 251-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of RA, NT2/D1-R1 cells fail to differentiate, continue to proliferate and retain tumorigenicity (11Moasser M.M. Khoo K.-S. Maerz W.J. Zelenetz A. Dmitrovsky E. Differentiation. 1996; 60: 251-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RARγ is the predominant retinoid receptor mediating differentiation in NT2/D1 cells (12Spinella M.J. Kitareewan S. Mellado B. Sekula D. Khoo K.-S. Dmitrovsky E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3471-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 13Moasser M.M. Reuter V.E. Dmitrovsky E. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1537-1543PubMed Google Scholar, 14Moasser M.M. DeBlasio A. Dmitrovsky E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 833-840PubMed Google Scholar). In NT2/D1 cells, transcriptional activation of RARγ is an early event occurring within 6 h following RA treatment (11Moasser M.M. Khoo K.-S. Maerz W.J. Zelenetz A. Dmitrovsky E. Differentiation. 1996; 60: 251-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Moasser M.M. Reuter V.E. Dmitrovsky E. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1537-1543PubMed Google Scholar). NT2/D1-R1 cells do not exhibit induced RARγ mRNA or protein expression after RA exposure (10Miller Jr., W.H. Maerz W.J. Kurie J.M. Moy D.

Exogenous expression of RARγ, but not RARα or RARβ, partially reverses RA resistance in NT2/D1-R1 cells (13Moasser M.M. Reuter V.E. Dmitrovsky E. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1537-1543PubMed Google Scholar). Engineered overexpression of RARγ in NT2/D1 cells also leads to enhanced transcriptional repression of fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4), a downstream target of RA during embryonal carcinoma differentiation (10Miller Jr., W.H. Maerz W.J. Kurie J.M. Moy D. Baselga J. Lucas D.A. Grippo J.F. Masui H. Dmitrovsky E. Differentiation. 1994; 55: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,12Spinella M.J. Kitareewan S.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 833-840PubMed Google Scholar). The predominant control of cell proliferation occurs during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, as previously reviewed (15Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) play major roles in the regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle events, as previously reviewed (16Lees E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The cyclin D family of G1 cyclins regulates activity of Cdk4 and Cdk6 (16Lees E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). One major target of cyclin D1/Cdk complexes is the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein that is maintained in an underphosphorylated state through much of G1 but becomes hyperphosphorylated in late G1, resulting in the release of sequestered transcription factors of the E2F family (15Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). Expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors can block S phase entry. The Cdk inhibitors are grouped into two classes (17Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). The Ink4 class contains p15, p16, p18, and p19, and the Kip class contains p21, p27, and p57 (17Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). Thus, the “Rb pathway” typified by cyclin D1/cdk4/p16/Rb constitutes a G1-S checkpoint that tightly controls cell cycle progression (18Bartek J. Bartkova J. Lukas J. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 19Planas-Silva M.D. Weinberg R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 768-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The importance of this pathway is underscored by the clinical finding that one component of the pathway is deregulated or mutated in the majority of cancers (18Bartek J. Bartkova J. Lukas J. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 is regulated by transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms, and its degradation is required for cells to enter S phase (reviewed in Ref. 20Deshaies R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 is targeted for rapid degradation involving the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway (21Diehl J.A. Zindy F.

Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 57-63Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 protein rapidly degrades following RA-mediated growth suppression of human bronchial epithelial cells due to a proteasome-dependent process (23Langenfeld J. Kiyokawa H. Sekula D. Boyle J. Dmitrovsky E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12070-12074Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 24Boyle J.O. Langenfeld J. Lonardo F. Sekula D. Reczek P. Rusch V. Dawson M.I. Dmitrovsky E. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 57-63Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This study indicates that cyclin D1 is a retinoid target during induced tumor cell growth suppression and terminal differentiation. A notable finding is that RA treatment markedly increases the formation of cyclin-D1 ubiquitin conjugates, which are substrates for proteasomal degradation. These data indicate that increased ubiquitination and instability of cyclin D1 link RA-mediated growth arrest and effective RA-mediated differentiation of NT2/D1 cells. The RA-sensitive human embryonal carcinoma cell NT2/D1 (a gift from Dr. Peter Andrews, Wistar Institute) is a clonal line derived from a xenograft of Tera-2 cells (25Andrews P.W. Damjonov I. Simon D. Banting G.S. Carlin C. Dracopoli N.C. Fogh J. Lab. Invest. 1984; 50: 147-162PubMed Google Scholar). Derivation and characterization of the NT2/D1-R1 cell line (an RA-resistant subclone of NT2/D1 cells) are described in detail elsewhere (11Moasser M.M. Khoo K.-S. Maerz W.J. Zelenetz A. Dmitrovsky E.

Differentiation. 1993; 54: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). NT2/D1-R1 cells stably transfected with episomal expression vectors containing RARα or RARγ were previously described and were maintained in 200 μg/ml hygromycin-containing media (13Moasser M.M. Reuter V.E. Dmitrovsky E. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1537-1543PubMed Google Scholar). NT2/D1 cells and clones derived and engineered from them were cultured in high glucose DME with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine under humidified 5% CO2. The RA induction protocols were as follows. On day −1, 1 × 105 or 4 × 105 cells were seeded into six-well plates or 10-cm dishes, respectively. On day 0, medium was replaced with medium containing 10 μm RA or dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (1:1000 dilution). Cells could be treated for 6 days before reaching confluence. RA was stored under liquid N2 in the dark as a 10 mm Me2SO stock solution. For cell cycle phase analysis, cells harvested with trypsinization were stained with propidium iodide for 30 min at 37 °C. The percentages of cells in G1, S, and G2/M were then determined on a Becton Dickinson FACscan flow cytometer using CellFit software and established techniques as described previously (26Baselga J.

Proliferation was measured by the thymidine incorporation method, as described (23Langenfeld J. Kiyokawa H. Sekula D. Boyle J. Dmitrovsky E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12070-12074Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 24Boyle J.O. Langenfeld J. Lonardo F. Sekula D. Reczek P. Rusch V. Dawson M.I. Dmitrovsky E. J. Natl.

Indirect fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis to evaluate RA-induced neuronal differentiation of NT2/D1 cells was performed using established techniques (28Kurie J.M. Buck J. Eppinger T.M. Moy D. Dmitrovsky E. Differentiation. 1993; 54: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, NT2/D1 and NT2/D1-R1 cells were harvested independently by trypsinization and incubated with a monoclonal antibody to the cell surface antigen A2B5 or an isotype matched monoclonal control antibody. The A2B5 antibody recognizes a neuronal epitope in RA-treated NT2/D1 cells and was prepared from hybridoma cultures purchased from ATCC (29Andrews P.W. Nudelman E. Hakomori S. Fenderson B.A. Differentiation. 1990; 43: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cells were indirectly assayed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody, and fluorescence was measured as described (29Andrews P.W. Nudelman E. Hakomori S. Fenderson B.A. Differentiation. 1990; 43: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mean peak fluorescent values and the percentage of positive cells were measured for the entire population. At least 2 × 104 cells were analyzed per assay. Exponentially growing cells were lysed in a modified radioimmune precipitation buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described (12Spinella M.J. Kitareewan S. Mellado B. Sekula D. Khoo K.-S. Dmitrovsky E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3471-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Langenfeld J. Kiyokawa H. Sekula D. Boyle J. Dmitrovsky E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1983-1990PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) was added to the lysis buffer to preserve ubiquitin conjugated proteins. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford technique. Cyclin D1 (M20) polyclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. HA antibody (16B12), a monoclonal antibody, was purchased from Babco. A monoclonal antibody specific for underphosphorylated forms of Rb (G99-549) was purchased from PharMingen. Full-length murine cyclin D1 cDNA was excised with BamHI from vector pGEX-3x Cyl-1 and inserted into BamHI- and BglII-restricted pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) to create an in-frame fusion between GFP and the N terminus of cyclin D1. GFP-cyclin D1 (T286A), in which threonine 286 is replaced by alanine, was constructed using a two-step polymerase chain reaction strategy with the above-described pGFP-cyclinD1 plasmid as template. The pRcCMV-cycD1-HA plasmid is an HA-tagged human cyclin D1 expression vector driven by the CMV promoter in pRC/CMV (Invitrogen) that was kindly provided by Dr. Steven Dowdy (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Washington University School of Medicine). A CMV-driven Myc-His-tagged ubiquitin expression plasmid, pCW7, was kindly provided by Dr. Ronald Kopito (Stanford University, CA). The pRcCMV-cycD1(T286A)-HA plasmid was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). DNA sequence analysis was used to confirm the identity of each construct. The FGF4 reporter assay was previously described (12Spinella M.J. Kitareewan S. Mellado B. Sekula D. Khoo K.-S. Dmitrovsky E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3471-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Moasser M.M. DeBlasio A. Dmitrovsky E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 833-840PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with 5.0 μg of DNA including 2.5 μg of reporter plasmid, 1.5 μg of expression plasmid, and 1.0 μg of a CMV-driven β-galactosidase expression plasmid using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation technique. For expression of human wild-type or mutant cyclin D1, the HA-tagged expression plasmids pRcCMV-cycD1-HA and pRcCMV-cycD1(T286A)-HA were used, respectively. The FGF4-CAT construct contains a human RA-sensitive FGF4 enhancer placed within a CAT-containing reporter driven by the endogenous human FGF4 promoter (31Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Cells (3 × 105) were exposed to DNA precipitate for 14–16 h and then to a HEPES-buffered saline-glycerol solution for 45 s. Cells were then washed and cultured with or without RA for an additional 48 h before harvesting in isotonic buffer (150 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 1 mm EDTA). CAT activity was measured as previously reported and was normalized to β-galactosidase activity (12Spinella M.J. Kitareewan S. Mellado B. Sekula D. Khoo K.-S. Dmitrovsky E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3471-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Moasser M.M. DeBlasio A. Dmitrovsky E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 833-840PubMed Google Scholar). In separate experiments, NT2/D1 cells were transfected with HA-tagged plasmids encoding human wild-type cyclin D1 and mutant cyclin D1 (T286A). NT2/D1 cells were preincubated for 24 h with RA before transfection. After overnight incubation with DNA precipitate, cells were incubated with RA for an additional 24 h; during the last 16 h, cells were also exposed to calpain inhibitor I (LLnL) or vehicle at a concentration of 50 μm. Cells were subsequently harvested for Western analysis using an antibody specific for HA. Cells were transfected with 20 μg of either pGFP-cyclin D1, pGFP-cyclin D1 (T286A), pEGFP-C1, or pBluescript SK, which was used as a control for autofluorescence. Cells were treated 24 h posttransfection with 10 μm RA or vehicle control for an addition 4 days. Cells were then harvested and stained for expression of the immunophenotypic marker A2B5 as described above, except that goat anti-mouse R-phycoerythrin-labeled IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) at a dilution of 1:100 was used in place of the usual fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. FACS analysis was performed on nonfixed cells that were dually gated for GFP and R-phycoerythrin fluorescence. Nuclei from a portion of the cells were isolated and stained with ethidium bromide for cell cycle analysis. At least 2 × 104 cells were analyzed for each assay. RA causes NT2/D1 cells to accumulate in the G1 phase of the cell cycle with a concomitant decrease in S phase (Fig. 1A). Unlike NT2/D1 cells, NT2/D1-R1 cells failed to accumulate in G1 after 6 days of RA treatment (Fig. 1A). To assess RA-induced changes in proliferation, NT2/D1 and NT2/D1-R1 cells were treated with 1 and 10 μm RA or Me2SO vehicle control and assayed for thymidine incorporation (Fig. 1B). NT2/D1 cells treated with 10 μm RA displayed a 60% decrease in S phase cells by day 2, as compared with vehicle control. A prominent induction of the neuroectodermal marker A2B5 appeared by day 4 of RA treatment of NT2/D1 cells but not NT2/D1-R1 cells (Fig. 1C). Complete morphologic differentiation, such as neuronal outgrowth, did not typically appear until approximately 3 weeks of RA treatment. As expected, NT2/D1-R1 cells did not display a decreased proliferation rate, despite RA treatment. The increase in thymidine incorporation over time was similar in RA and vehicle control treated NT2/D1-R1 cells (Fig. 1B). Morphologic and immunophenotypic maturation did not follow RA treatment of NT2/D1-R1 cells (Ref. 14Moasser M.M. DeBlasio A. Dmitrovsky E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 833-840PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 1C). These findings indicate that RA resistance in NT2/D1-R1 cells is associated with an aberrant G1-S cell cycle blockade. Expression of proteins known to regulate the G1 phase of the cell cycle was examined. A marked increase in steady-state cyclin D1 levels in NT2/D1-R1 cells compared with NT2/D1 cells was noted (Fig. 2A). The level of this overexpression as compared with parental NT2/D1 cells ranged from 3- to 7-fold in independent analysis. Fig. 2B compares the time course of cyclin D1 expression in NT2/D1 and NT2/D1-R1 cells after RA treatment. Cyclin D1 expression markedly declined in NT2/D1 cells within 2 days of 10 μm RA treatment. This is well before onset of expression of early immunophenotypic differentiation markers (Fig. 1C) but within the time frame when commitment to differentiation occurred. In contrast, RA fails to signal a decline of cyclin D1 in NT2/D1-R1 cells. NT2/D1 and NT2/D1-R1 had similar basal and post-retinoid treatment levels of cyclin A, cyclin E, cyclin D2, Cdk-4, Cdk-6, Rb, p27, and p16 (data not shown). Cyclin D3 protein was not detected in NT2/D1 cells. NT2/D1 and NT2/D1-R1 cells were exposed to varying dosages of RA and simultaneously assayed by immunoblot and cell cycle analyses. RA treatment of NT2/D1 cells resulted in a dose-dependent decline in cyclin D1 protein (Fig. 3A). In contrast, cyclin D1 expression was maintained at much higher levels than in NT2/D1R1 cells. Even at the highest doses of RA (10 μm) cyclin D1 expression in NT2/D1-R1 cells was comparable to levels detected in untreated NT2/D1 cells. Persistent cyclin D1 expression in NT2/D1-R1 cells is observed after extended (up to 4 weeks) exposure to RA. The decline in cyclin D1 expression coincided with an RA dose-dependent G1 arrest in NT2/D1 cells (Fig. 3B). G1 arrest was not evident in RA-treated NT2/D1-R1 cells (Fig. 3B). RA-treated lysates were probed with an antibody recognizing hypophosphorylated Rb. The decline in cyclin D1 expression after RA treatment of NT2/D1 cells was tightly correlated with a dose-dependent accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb. In contrast, the levels of hypophosphorylated Rb were negligible in NT2/D1-R1 cells (Fig. 3C). This is expected because NT2/D1-R1 cells can be continuously passaged in RA without induction of cell cycle arrest. This suggests that, in this cell context, cyclin D1 expression is rate-limiting in regulating Rb-specific Cdk activity. RARγ is the predominant retinoid receptor signaling RA effects in NT2/D1 cells (12Spinella M.J. Kitareewan S. Mellado B. Sekula D. Khoo K.-S. Dmitrovsky E.

NT2/D1-R1 RARγ transfectants decreased cyclin D1 expression after RA treatment (Fig. 4). This is consistent with our prior work showing that RARγ restores RA-mediated growth suppression and partially restores neuronal differentiation to this cell line (13Moasser M.M. Reuter V.E. Dmitrovsky E. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1537-1543PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, cells overexpressing RARα or an insertless control vector known to have no effect on the growth and differentiation properties of NT2/D1-R1 cells (12Spinella M.J. Kitareewan S. Mellado B. Sekula D. Khoo K.-S. Dmitrovsky E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3471-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 13Moasser M.M. Reuter V.E. Dmitrovsky E. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1537-1543PubMed Google Scholar) did not suppress cyclin D1 expression after RA treatment. This indicates that RA-signaled decline in cyclin D1 is retinoid receptor-dependent. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor LLnL reversed the decline in cyclin D1 protein after RA treatment of NT2/D1 cells, as shown in Fig. 5A. Diehl et al.(21Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) have reported that phosphorylation of threonine 286 signals ubiquitination and degradation of cyclin D1 in response to mitogen withdrawal. NT2/D1 cells were transiently transfected with an ubiquitin expression plasmid and either HA-tagged wild-type cyclin D1 or cyclin D1 in which threonine 286 was replaced with alanine (T286A). Cells were then exposed to RA in the presence or absence of LLnL. As shown in Fig. 5B, slow migrating cyclin D1 species were evident in wild-type transfectants treated with RA and LLnL, consistent with appearance of higher ubiquitinated forms. This effect was dependent on threonine 286 because higher molecular weight forms were not detected in cyclin D1 (T286A) mutant transfectants treated with LLnL and RA. This finding demonstrates that RA accelerates formation of ubiquitinated forms of cyclin D1 (Fig. 5B, comparelanes 1 and 3). Other mechanisms in addition to proteolysis may contribute to regulation of cyclin D1 by RA. A slight decline in cyclin D1 mRNA was evident in NT2/D1 cells as assayed by Northern and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses (data not shown). This occurred relatively late, 72 h after RA treatment, suggesting that this effect is secondary to G1arrest, decreased cell proliferation, and commitment to differentiation, which occur within 48 h. Interestingly, levels of cyclin D1 transcripts were lower in NT2/D1-R1 cells compared with parental NT2/D1 cells (data not shown), despite substantial overexpression of cyclin D1 protein in NT2/D1-R1 cells. The extent to which transcriptional control contributes to RA-mediated decline of cyclin D1 protein is a subject for future work. We previously reported the adaptation of a transient transfection reporter assay to rapidly assess differentiation signals in NT2/D1 cells (12Spinella M.J. Kitareewan S. Mellado B. Sekula D.

This assay uses a construct containing human FGF4 promoter-enhancer elements linked to the CAT reporter gene (31Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L.

https://openalex.org/W2026578973,"We examined the importance of the Rho family GTPase Rac1 for cyclin D1 promoter transcriptional activation in bovine tracheal myocytes. Overexpression of active Rac1 induced transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter, whereas platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced transcription was inhibited by a dominant-negative allele of Rac1, suggesting that Rac1 functions as an upstream activator of cyclin D1 in this system. Rac1 forms part of the NADPH oxidase complex that generates reactive oxygen species such as H2O2. PDGF stimulated a substantial increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species, as measured by the fluorescence of dichlorofluorescein-loaded cells, and this was blocked by the glutathione peroxidase mimetic ebselen. Pretreatment with ebselen, catalase, and the flavoprotein inhibitor diphenylene iodonium each attenuated PDGF- and Rac1-mediated cyclin D1 promoter activation, while having no effect on the induction of cyclin D1 by mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase-1 (MEK1), the upstream activator of ERKs. Antioxidant treatment also inhibited PDGF-induced cyclin D1 protein expression and DNA synthesis. Overexpression of an N-terminal fragment of p67 phox, a component of NADPH oxidase which interacts with Rac1, attenuated PDGF-induced cyclin D1 promoter activity, whereas overexpression of the wild-type p67 did not. Finally, Rac1 was neither required nor sufficient for ERK activation. Taken together, these data suggest a model by which two distinct signaling pathways, the ERK and Rac1 pathways, positively regulate cyclin D1 and smooth muscle growth.

Taken together, these data suggest a model by which two distinct signaling pathways, the ERK and Rac1 pathways, positively regulate cyclin D1 and smooth muscle growth. Excess airway smooth muscle cell proliferation is thought to contribute to airflow obstruction in patients with asthma (1Ebina M. Takahashi T. Chiba T. Motomiya M. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1993; 148: 720-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The signaling mechanisms underlying airway smooth muscle proliferation are not completely understood.

The mechanisms underlying this requirement are not precisely known. Rac constitutes part of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex that generates reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 (8Abo A. Pick E.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16767-16770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme, by donating an electron, catalyzes the reaction: 2 O2 + NADPH → 2 O⨪2 + NADP + H+. The superoxide produced is subsequently converted to H2O2. The human NADPH oxidase consists of at least seven components: two membrane spanning polypeptides, p22 phox and gp91 phox (which comprise cytochrome b558), three cytoplasmic polypeptides, p47 phox, p67 phox, and p40 phox, Rap1A and Rac, the last of which is required for oxidase activation. Increasing evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species may play a role in mitogen-activated cell signaling. Recent data suggest that the generation of H2O2 by NADPH oxidase occurs in tissues other than phagocytes, including aortic adventitia, kidney, liver, vascular smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts (10Pagano P.J.

Science. 1998; 280: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Finally, it has recently been demonstrated that a Rac1 effector site critical for the activation of NADPH oxidase is also required for the mitogenic effect of Rac1 in rat embryonic fibroblasts (20Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17991-17994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In NIH3T3 cells, Rac1 activates transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter (21Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell.

However, the requirement of reactive oxygen species for transcriptional activation of cyclin D1 has not been tested. In the present study, we examined the importance of the Rho family GTPase Rac1 for airway smooth muscle cyclin D1 expression. Overexpression of active Rac1 induced transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter. PDGF-induced transcription was also inhibited by a dominant-negative allele of Rac1, suggesting that Rac1 is a critical upstream activator of the cyclin D1 promoter in these cells. PDGF stimulated a substantial increase in the fluorescence of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA)-loaded cells which was blocked by the glutathione peroxidase mimetic ebselen, implying that growth factor treatment increases the concentration of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, antioxidants (ebselen, catalase) and inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (the flavoprotein inhibitor diphenylene iodonium and the N-terminal fragment of p67 phox) attenuated PDGF- and Rac1-mediated cyclin D1 promoter activation, but had no effect on the response induced by MEK1, the upstream activator of ERKs. Finally, Rac1 was neither required nor sufficient for ERK activation. Taken together, these data suggest that Rac1-induced cyclin D1 expression is mediated by the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, these data suggest a model by which two distinct signaling pathways, the ERK and Rac1 pathways, positively regulate smooth muscle growth.

To construct the reporter −1745CD1LUC, an 1882-base pairPvuII fragment of the human cyclin D1 genomic clone was subcloned into the vector pA3 (28Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D.

Bovine tracheal smooth muscle cells were isolated as described previously (30Abe M.K. Chao T.S. Solway J. Rosner M.R. Hershenson M.B. Am. J. Resp. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Myocytes of passage number 5 or less were studied. Confluent cultures exhibited the typical “hill and valley” appearance and showed specific immunostaining for α-smooth muscle actin. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% non-essential amino acids, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were seeded into 60-mm dishes at 50–80% confluence and incubated in 10% FBS/DMEM overnight. After rinsing, cells were incubated with a liposome solution consisting of serum- and antibiotic-free medium, plasmid DNA (total of 1.8 μg/plate) and LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD; 12 μl/plate). Cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids encoding the human cyclin D1 promoter subcloned into a luciferase reporter and either the relevant expression vector or control vector. After 5 h, the liposome solution was replaced with 10% FBS/DMEM. The next day, cells were serum-starved in DMEM. After 24 h of serum starvation, selected cultures were treated with PDGF (30 ng/ml). Finally, 8 h after PDGF treatment, cells were harvested for analysis of luciferase activity using lysis buffer provided with the Promega Luciferase Assay system (Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was measured at room temperature using a luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Luciferase content was assessed by measuring the light emitted during the initial 30 s of the reaction and the values expressed in arbitrary light units. The background activity from cell extracts was typically less than 0.02 units, compared with signals on the order of 102-103 units. Cyclin D1 promoter transcriptional activation was normalized for transfection efficiency by co-transfecting cells with a cDNA encoding β-galactosidase (30 ng/plate). β-Galactosidase activity was assessed by colorimetric assay usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside as a substrate (31Parmacek M.S. Vora A.J. Shen T. Barr E. Jung F. Leiden J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1967-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The transfection of primary cells holds certain limitations that should be noted here. First, transfection efficiency, as assessed by β-galactosidase staining, was less than 50%. Second, co-transfection with viral promoter-driven expression vectors tended to suppress cyclin D1 promoter activity. Concentration-response curves were therefore generated for each expression vector to determine optimal concentration. In all cases, concentrations of 30–100 ng/plate were used. Also, due to unacceptably low cyclin D1 promoter activity levels, we were unable to co-transfect cells with more than two expression vectors (β-galactosidase plus one signaling intermediate of interest). Cells were cultured in 6-well plates and serum starved for 24 h prior to PDGF treatment (30 ng/ml for 16 h). Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mphosphate, pH 7.5) and extracted in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mmsodium fluoride, 200 μm Na3VO4, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100. Lysates were centrifuged (13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C) and the supernatant transferred to fresh microcentrifuge tubes. Extracts (10 μg) were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose by semidry transfer (Hoefer, San Francisco, CA). After incubation with a polyclonal antibody against cyclin D1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), signals were amplified and visualized using anti-rabbit IgG and enhanced chemiluminescence. Cells were transiently co-transfected with cDNAs encoding HA-tagged ERK2 and the expression vector of interest. Cells were seeded into 100-mm plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/plate and incubated in 10% FBS/DMEM overnight. After rinsing, cells were incubated in a solution consisting of serum- and antibiotic-free medium, plasmid DNA (10 μg/plate) and LipofectAMINE (40 μl/plate). After 5 h, the solution was replaced with 10% FBS/DMEM. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were serum-starved in DMEM. The next day, selected cultures were treated with PDGF (30 ng/ml for 10 min). Activation of ERK was then assessed by immunoprecipitation of the epitope tag, followed by an in vitro phosphorylation assay using MBP as a substrate, as described (27Hershenson M.B. Chao T.S.O.

Treated cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in a lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 200 μmNa3VO4, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (30 min at 4 °C). Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C). Cell lysates were then incubated for 3 h with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads precoupled with the 12CA5 anti-hemagglutinin antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 200 μm Na3VO4, and 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Immune complexes were resuspended in a final volume of 30 μl of kinase buffer and incubated (20 min at 30 °C) with 5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP and 0.25 mg/ml MBP. Reactions were terminated by adding Laemmli buffer and boiling. Samples were resolved on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate gel and the proteins transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by semi-dry transfer. After Ponceau staining, the membrane was exposed to film and substrate phosphorylation assessed by optical scanning (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). To confirm that apparent differences in ERK activity were not related to alterations in expression of the epitope-tagged ERK, nitrocellulose membranes were probed with the anti-hemagglutinin antibody 12CA5. Signals were amplified and visualized using peroxidase-linked rat anti-mouse κ light chain IgG and enhanced chemiluminescence. In some experiments, the ERK activity of whole cell lysates was estimated by determining the level of phosphorylated ERKs. These experiments utilized a phospho-specific antibody (32Creedon D. Johnson Jr., E. Lawrence Jr., J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20713-20718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) which recognizes ERKs only when phosphorylated at Thr183 and Tyr185, which are required for full enzymatic activity (33Anderson N.G. Maller J.L. Tonks N.K. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1990; 343: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose, as described above. After incubation with antibody, signals were amplified and visualized using anti-rabbit IgG and enhanced chemiluminescence. Cells were grown on coverslips in 35-mm2 tissue culture-treated dishes. Coverslips were placed inside a perfusion chamber and imaged with an inverted phase/epifluorescent microscope. Fluorescence was measured with a cooled slow-scanning PC-controlled camera coupled to imaging software for quantification of changes in emission fluorescence. Cells were loaded with DCFH-DA (10 μm) and dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence was determined by imaging with an inverted phase/epifluorescence microscope, as described (34Vanden Hoek T.L. Becker L.B. Shao Z. Li C. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18092-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). After a 1-h stabilization period, selected cultures were treated with PDGF (30 ng/ml). In some instances, cells were pretreated with ebselen (30 μm). Subconfluent bovine tracheal myocytes were serum starved in DMEM for 24 h. Eight h following PDGF treatment, cells were incubated with bromodeoxyuridine (10 μm) and fluorodeoxyuridine (1 μm). In some wells, catalase (100–1000 units/ml) was added 45 min prior to growth factor treatment. Sixteen h later, myocytes were fixed in periodate lysine paraformaldehyde buffer and the DNA precipitated with 2 m HCl. After acid neutralization with 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 9.0, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Cells were then immunostained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-BrdUrd and counterstained with propidium iodide. We examined the importance of the Rho family GTPase Rac1 for cyclin D1 promoter activation in bovine tracheal myocytes. Cells were co-transfected with cDNAs encoding the cyclin D1promoter subcloned into luciferase and a constitutively active form of Rac1. Overexpression of active Rac1 induced transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter (Fig. 1). As reported previously (3Ramakrishnan M. Musa N.L. Li J. Liu P. Pestell R.G. Hershenson M.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 736-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), overexpression of a constitutively active MEK1 also increased cyclin D1 promoter activity. To determine the requirement of Rac1 for PDGF-induced cyclin D1 promoter activity, cells were transiently co-transfected with the dominant-negative Rac1 and the luciferase-tagged cyclin D1 promoter. N17Rac1 attenuated the PDGF-induced transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter (Fig. 1). Taken together, these experiments suggest that Rac1 is an important upstream activator of the cyclin D1 promoter in airway smooth muscle cells. In HEK293 human kidney fibroblasts, co-expression of Raf-1 and Rac1 caused a synergistic increase in both MEK1 and ERK activation which was greater than the sum of their effects alone (35Frost J.A. Xu S. Hutchison M.R. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3707-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar,36Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Since both active Rac1 and MEK1 induce cyclin D1promoter activity (above), it is conceivable that activation of Rho family kinases enhances cyclin D1 transcriptional activation via activation of ERK. We therefore assessed the requirement and sufficiency of Rac1 for ERK activation. Cells were transiently co-transfected with hemagglutinin-tagged ERK2 and either V12Rac1 or N17Rac1. ERK activity was assessed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-hemagglutinin antibody followed by in vitrophosphorylation using MBP as the substrate. Rac1 was neither required nor sufficient for activation of ERK2 (Fig. 2, A and B). We also tested the effects of a synthetic MEK inhibitor, PD98059, on Rac1-induced responses. Pretreatment with PD98059 attenuated PDGF-induced cyclin D1 promoter activity, but did not decrease Rac1-activated transcription (Fig. 2C). These data strongly suggest that activation of ERK is not required for Rac1-induced transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter. Since inhibition of either Rac1 or MEK1 attenuated PDGF-induced cyclin D1 promoter activity, we also sought to determine whether Rac1 might function downstream of MEK1 in this pathway. We reasoned that if this model were correct, then the downstream transcription factor targets of each intermediate would activate the same site on the cyclin D1 promoter. To test this, we examined the response of two 5′ cyclin D1 promoter fragments, −163CD1LUC and −66CD1LUC, to PDGF, Rac1, and MEK1 stimulation. Although cyclin D1 promoter basal activity was somewhat decreased in these 5′ deletion mutants (data not shown), PDGF and Rac1 responsiveness was maintained, whereas MEK1 responsiveness was lost upon deletion of base pairs −163 to −66 (Fig. 2D). These data imply that the downstream transcription factor targets of the MEK1 and Rac1 pathways act at different sites in the cyclin D1 promoter, and provide evidence that Rac1 and ERK function on distinct signaling pathways. Production of reactive oxygen species has been noted upon growth factor stimulation of arterial smooth muscle cells (14Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2321) Google Scholar) and chondrocytes (15Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). To test whether PDGF treatment induces the intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species in bovine tracheal myocytes, cells were loaded with DCFH-DA (10 μm). Upon loading, DCFH-DA enters the cell and the acetate group is cleaved by cellular esterases, trapping the non-fluorescent DCFH inside. Subsequent oxidation by reactive oxygen species, particularly H2O2 and hydroxyl radical, yields the fluorescent product DCF. PDGF (30 ng/ml) increased DCF fluorescence almost 2-fold over baseline (Fig. 3). This increase was similar in magnitude to that observed after hypoxic exposure of cardiac myocytes (34Vanden Hoek T.L. Becker L.B. Shao Z. Li C. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18092-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), and was blocked by ebselen (30 μm), a glutathione peroxidase mimetic (37Sies H. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1993; 14: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). To examine the potential role of reactive oxygen species in growth factor and Rac1-induced cyclin D1promoter activity, we tested the effect of ebselen on PDGF-, Rac1-, and MEK1-mediated responses. PDGF- and V12Rac1-induced cyclin D1 promoter activities were attenuated by ebselen pretreatment, whereas MEK-2E-induced responses were not (Fig. 4A). Pretreatment with catalase also attenuated PDGF-induced cyclin D1 promoter activity (Fig. 4B). Finally, ebselen and catalase each decreased cyclin D1 protein abundance (Fig. 4C). Antioxidant pretreatment had no effect on PDGF-induced ERK phosphorylation, however (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these data suggest that there are antioxidant-sensitive (Rac1-mediated) and antioxidant-insensitive (mediated by MEK1/ERK) pathways to cyclin D1 expression in bovine tracheal myocytes, and provide further evidence that Rac1 and ERK function on distinct signaling pathways. We have previously demonstrated in bovine tracheal myocytes that cyclin D1 is required for DNA synthesis (4Xiong W. Pestell R.G. Watanabe G. Li J. Rosner M.R. Hershenson M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L1205-L1210PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that antioxidant pretreatment would decrease DNA synthesis in these cells. Pretreatment of cells with catalase abolished PDGF-induced fractional BrdUrd labeling (Fig. 5). Recent data suggest that the generation of H2O2 by NADPH oxidase occurs in tissues other than phagocytes, including vascular smooth muscle cells (10Pagano P.J. Clark J.K. Cifuentes-Pagano M.E.

Amino acid substitution analysis revealed that Arg and Leu residues within the KIM are essential for the interaction and suggested a regulatory role for Ser231. Finally, coexpression of PTP-SL and ERK2 in COS-7 cells resulted in the retention of ERK2 in the cytoplasm in a KIM-dependent manner.

Differences in the response of ERK1/2 to activation agents have been postulated to account for the cell type- and stimulus-specific adaptive responses mediated by these kinases (9Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4210) Google Scholar). For instance, inhibition of ERK1/2 function prevents proliferation of Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts in response to growth-stimulating agents (10Pagès G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.-C. Meloche S. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ERK1 and ERK2 also mediate the inhibition of cell growth arrest induced by nerve growth factor in 3T3 cells (13Pumiglia K.M. Decker S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and the differentiation of neuronal PC12 or erythroleukemia K562 cells is blocked by inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway (11Cowley S.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1947-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic activation of ERK1/2 requires the phosphorylation of both tyrosine and threonine regulatory residues, which is accomplished by the dual-specificity kinases MEK1 and MEK2 (16Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Upon activation, ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylate cytosolic and membrane-bound proteins, including signal transduction molecules and cytoskeletal components (1Cobb M.H. Boulton T.G. Robbins D.J. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 2Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, after stimulus-induced translocation to the nucleus, ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylate and regulate the function of several transcription factors, thereby controlling the expression of specific responsive genes (17Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar, 18Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of ERK1/2 nuclear translocation is not well understood. In this regard, the physical interaction of ERK1/2 with cytosolic and nuclear substrates has been reported (19Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Chang E.C. Cairns B.R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3637-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 20Yang S.-H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), suggesting that tight binding to their substrates may be a mechanism that regulates the subcellular location of these kinases as well as their enzymatic specificity. The inactivation of ERK1/2 in the nucleus is achieved by specific dual-specificity phosphatases (MKPs), which are induced following ERK1/2 activation (21Keyse S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 145-160Google Scholar). In addition, a cytosolic MKP, MKP-3/Pyst1/rVH6, has been found to inactivate ERK1/2 (22Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M.

Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) inactivate ERK1 and ERK2 by dephosphorylating their tyrosine regulatory residue (25Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Several PTPs have been shown to tyrosine-dephosphorylate and to inactivate ERK1/2in vitro (26Anderson N.G.

In this context, we have recently shown that the tyrosine phosphatase PTP-SL dephosphorylates and inactivates ERK1/2 by association through a kinase interaction motif (KIM) and that such association leads to the phosphorylation of PTP-SL at a Thr residue downstream of the KIM (32Pulido R. Zúñiga Á. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Here, we present a mutational analysis of the KIM of PTP-SL and characterize the binding requirements and the substrate specificity of MAP kinases for this phosphatase. We also show that binding to PTP-SL through the KIM retains ERK2 in the cytoplasm, blocking its translocation to the nucleus. A major checkpoint role in the MAP kinase signaling pathways is proposed for the physical and functional association between MAP kinases and PTP-SL. Mouse PTP-SL and ERK2 cDNA constructs have been previously described (32Pulido R. Zúñiga Á. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Bovine PKCα (33Coussens L. Parker P.J. Rhee L. Yang-Feng T.L. Chen E. Waterfield M.D. Francke U. Ullrich A.

PTP-SL mutations were performed by polymerase chain reaction oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis, and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For the construction of plasmids encoding GST fusion proteins, cDNAs were subcloned into the expression vector pGEX-5X. pGEX-5X-c-Jun-(1–96) was obtained by subcloning of a cDNA fragment (obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from a human placenta cDNA library) encoding the N-terminal portion of c-Jun (amino acids 1–96). pGEX-ATF2 encodes amino acids 1–254 from ATF2. Purification of the GST fusion proteins was done by standard procedures. GST-PTP-SL-(147–288) was covalently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) following the manufacturer's instructions. The apparent molecular masses of all purified GST fusion proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide gels were in accordance with their predicted sizes, as follows: GST, 29 kDa; GST-PTP-SL-(147–549), 74 kDa; GST-PTP-SL-(147–288), 45 kDa; GST-ATF2, 55 kDa; and GST-c-Jun-(1–96), 42 kDa. Rabbit polyclonal anti-PTP-SL, anti-ERK1 (C-16), and anti-ERK2 (C-14) antibodies and the 12CA5 anti-HA and 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine mAbs have been described (32Pulido R. Zúñiga Á. Ullrich A.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA) and Promega (Madison, WI). Fluorescein isothiocyanate- and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies, as well as pNPP and nucleotides, were from Sigma. EGF was from Life Technologies, Inc. and was used at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml. Glutathione-Sepharose, protein A-Sepharose, [γ-32P]ATP, and polyvinylidene difluoride filters were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Rat fibroblastic Rat-1, human embryonic kidney 293, and simian COS-7 cell lines (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing high glucose (4.5 g/liter) supplemented with 5% (for COS-7 cells) or 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). COS-7 cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method, and 293 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method; in both cases, cells were harvested after 48–72 h of culture. Precipitation and immunoblotting were carried out as described (32Pulido R. Zúñiga Á. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 mm NaF, 2 mmNa3VO4, and 20 mmNa4P2O7). Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm, and post-nuclear supernatants were precleared with glutathione-Sepharose or protein A-Sepharose. For GST fusion protein precipitation, 1 μg of GST fusion protein was added per sample, followed by glutathione-Sepharose. In samples precipitated with GST-PTP-SL-(147–288) coupled to Sepharose, addition of glutathione-Sepharose was omitted. For immunoprecipitation, mAb 12CA5 was added, followed by protein A-Sepharose. Precipitates were washed with HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) and resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting and chemiluminescence analysis. Dilution of antibodies and washing of polyvinylidene difluoride filters for immunoblotting were done in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.25% gelatin. For in vitro kinase assays, pellets obtained after precipitation with mAb 12CA5 and washing with HNTG buffer were washed once with kinase reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmNa3VO4, and 0.3 μm ATP); pellets were then resuspended in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing the GST fusion proteins as substrate(s) and 0.5–2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at room temperature for 15 min under constant shaking. Reactions were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer and boiling. The reaction mixture was loaded and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and radioactivity incorporated into the GST fusion proteins was visualized by autoradiography. In vitrophosphatase assays were performed in phosphatase reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol). For dephosphorylation of HA-ERK2, wild-type or mutant GST-PTP-SL-(147–549) fusion proteins were mixed with pellets containing phosphorylated HA-ERK2 and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. Reactions were stopped; samples were resolved as described above; and HA-ERK2 phosphotyrosine content was determined by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10. For pNPP hydrolysis, GST-PTP-SL fusion proteins were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in phosphatase reaction buffer containing 20 mm pNPP (200-μl final volume). Reactions were stopped by adding 800 μl of 0.2 n NaOH, and pNPP hydrolysis was measured by absorbance at 410 nm. COS-7 cells were seeded at 1 × 104 cells/cm2 onto glass coverslips and cultured for 24 h; the cells were then transfected as described above and processed for immunofluorescence after 36–48 h of culture. Cells were rinsed once with IPBS buffer (1.5 mmKH2PO4, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.7 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4)) and then fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 5 min. Samples were incubated in blocking solution (IPBS buffer containing 3% bovine serum) at room temperature for 15 min, followed by incubation at 37°C for 90–120 min with a mixture of the anti-HA and anti-PTP-SL primary antibodies. After washing with IPBS buffer, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a mixture of the fluorescein isothiocyanate- and tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies, followed by washing with IPBS buffer and mounting. We have shown that PTP-SL associates with ERK1/2 through a KIM (residues 224–239; amino acid numbering is according to Ref. 35Hendriks W. Schepens J. Brugman C. Zeeuwen P. Wieringa B. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) located in the cytosolic juxtamembrane region of this PTP (32Pulido R. Zúñiga Á. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To study the specificity of this association, the interaction of PTP-SL with other kinases was investigated. COS-7 cells were transfected with HA-tagged ERK1, ERK2, JNK1, or p38/HOG kinase, and cell lysates were precipitated with a GST-PTP-SL fusion protein containing the KIM (GST-PTP-SL-(147–288)), followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA mAb 12CA5 (Fig. 1A). GST-PTP-SL-(147–288) precipitated both recombinant HA-ERK1 and HA-ERK2 (Fig. 1A,lanes 3 in the first and second panels, respectively), whereas a mutant fusion protein lacking the KIM (GST-PTP-SL-(147–288)ΔKIM) did not associate with the kinases (lanes 4). Interestingly, HA-p38/HOG, but not HA-JNK1, was also precipitated by GST-PTP-SL-(147–288) in a KIM-dependent manner (Fig. 1A, thirdand fourth panels, respectively). The expression of the distinct kinases as controls in the transfected cells is shown (Fig. 1A, lanes 1). Since the juxtamembrane region of PTP-SL possesses several phosphorylation consensus sites for PKA and PKC, the possibility was also tested whether PTP-SL associates with either of these kinases. Cell lysates from Rat-1 cells or PKCα-transfected 293 cells were precipitated with GST-PTP-SL-(147–288), followed by immunoblotting with anti-PKA or anti-PKC antibodies, respectively. No association of GST-PTP-SL with PKA or PKC was observed under these conditions (Fig. 1B,lanes 3 in the upper and lower panels, respectively). Thus, PTP-SL specifically associates through the KIM with ERK1, ERK2, and p38/HOG. Binding of PTP-SL to ERK1 and ERK2 results in phosphorylation of the PTP by these kinases at Thr253 (Ref. 32Pulido R. Zúñiga Á. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 6). Next, the phosphorylation of PTP-SL by ERK2, JNK1, and p38/HOG was compared. Cell lysates from activated COS-7 cells transfected with HA-ERK2, HA-JNK1, or HA-p38/HOG were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA mAb 12CA5; in vitro kinase assays were then performed on the immune complexes using GST-PTP-SL-(147–288) as the substrate in combination with JNK- and p38/HOG-specific substrates, i.e.GST-c-Jun and GST-ATF2 (Fig. 1C). As shown, ERK2 specifically phosphorylated GST-PTP-SL-(147–288) (Fig. 1C,lanes 1 and 2), whereas this substrate was poorly phosphorylated by JNK1 as compared with the extent of phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun (lane 4). p38/HOG phosphorylated both GST-ATF2 and GST-PTP-SL-(147–288) (Fig. 1C, lane 3), although the levels of phosphorylation under our experimental conditions were weaker than those observed for ERK2 and JNK1 with their substrates. Finally, the in vitro dephosphorylation of ERK2 by wild-type PTP-SL and PTP-SLΔKIM was compared. Phosphorylated HA-ERK2 was immunoprecipitated from EGF-activated COS-7 cells transfected with HA-ERK2, and immune complex pellets were subjected to phosphatase assays in the presence of wild-type GST-PTP-SL-(147–549) or mutant forms. Tyrosine dephosphorylation of ERK2 was efficiently achieved by wild-type PTP-SL (Fig. 2A,lanes 2 and 3), but not by PTP-SLΔKIM (lanes 4 and 5). As a control, the lack of ERK2 tyrosine dephosphorylation upon incubation with the catalytically inactive PTP-SL C480S mutant is shown (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 7).In vitro phosphatase assays were performed in parallel with GST-PTP-SL-(147–549) and GST-PTP-SL-(147–549)ΔKIM using the nonspecific substrate pNPP (Fig. 2B). No differences were observed between the activities for pNPP in wild-type PTP-SL and the ΔKIM mutant, indicating that the deletion of the KIM did not affect the PTP-SL phosphatase activity itself, but rather the recognition of the ERK2-specific substrate. To examine the stability of the ERK1/2·PTP-SL complex, Rat-1 cell lysates were incubated with GST-PTP-SL-(147–288) coupled to Sepharose; after washing, pellets containing GST-PTP-SL-(147–288) and bound ERK1/2 were incubated separately in HEPES buffer at distinct pH values. The eluted samples and the corresponding pellets were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and ERK1 and ERK2 were detected by immunoblotting with anti-ERK1/2 antibodies (Fig. 3A). ERK1 and ERK2 dissociated from PTP-SL only under extreme pH conditions (Fig. 3A,lanes 1 and 5 and lanes 6 and 10). The effect of distinct ionic strength or denaturing conditions on the stability of the complex was also analyzed (Fig. 3B). In these experiments, the GST-PTP-SL-(147–288)-Sepharose pellets containing ERK1/2 were eluted sequentially with increasing concentrations of NaCl, urea, or SDS, and ERK1 and ERK2 were detected in the eluted supernatants and in the final pellets (obtained after the last extraction). Upon elution with NaCl or urea up to 4 m, only a small fraction of ERK1/2 was eluted (Fig. 3B, upper panel, lanes 3–5 and lanes 8–10), and most of the kinase remained bound to the beads (lanes 6 and 11). Elution with SDS was achieved at SDS concentrations of 0.1–0.5% (Fig. 3B, lower panel,lanes 3–7), although a significant amount of ERK1/2 was still detected in the beads (lane 8). Since kinases bind ATP to phosphorylate their substrates, the effect of nucleotides on the dissociation of the ERK1/2·PTP-SL complex was investigated (Fig. 4). Rat-1 cells were left untreated or were treated with EGF to activate ERK1/2, and cell lysates were precipitated with GST-PTP-SL-(147–288). Under these conditions, no difference is observed in the amount of ERK1/2 precipitated by GST-PTP-SL-(147–288) from untreated or EGF-treated cells (32Pulido R. Zúñiga Á. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Pellets containing ERK1/2 were then sequentially incubated in HEPES buffer containing increasing concentrations of nucleotides, and the eluted supernatants and final pellets were processed for ERK1/2 detection. Low concentrations of ATP dissociated the ERK1/2·PTP-SL complex in the pellets from untreated cells (Fig. 4A,lanes 2–5), whereas in those from EGF-treated cells, the complex was more resistant to dissociation (lanes 8–11). Similar elution profiles were achieved with the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP; and other nucleotides, including ADP, AMP, and GTP, also partially eluted ERK1/2 from GST-PTP-SL-(147–288) beads, although at a lesser extent than ATP (Fig. 4B; data not shown). The contribution of the amino acids within the PTP-SL KIM sequence to the interaction with ERK1/2 was investigated. Site-directed mutagenesis of the KIM was performed, and the corresponding mutant GST-PTP-SL-(147–288) fusion proteins were obtained and used to precipitate ERK1/2 from Rat-1 cell lysates (Fig. 5). Deletion of the N-terminal (Δ222–231, Δ224–233) or C-terminal (Δ232–240) portions of the KIM abrogated the association with ERK1/2 (Fig. 5A,lanes 5–7), indicating that integrity of the motif is required for the kinase recognition. Single amino acid substitutions were then generated within the KIM to identify the residues necessary for the interaction (Fig. 5B). Substitution of Leu225, Arg228, Arg229, Leu235, or Leu237 with Ala (mutations L225A, R228A, R229A, R228A/R229A, L235A, and L237A) abolished the recognition of ERK1/2 (Fig. 5B,lanes 5, 8–10, 16, and 18). Furthermore, conservative substitution of Arg228 or Arg229 with Lys or Leu235with Ile (mutations R228K, R229K, and L235I) also abrogated the association with ERK1/2 (Fig. 5C, lanes 5, 6, and 8). However, substitution of Leu225 or Leu237 with Ile (mutations L225I and L237I) did not affect such an association (Fig. 5C,lanes 7 and 9). Finally, Ala substitution of other KIM residues, including Gly230, Asn232, and Val233 (mutations G230A, N232A, and V233A), partially affected the binding to ERK1/2 (Fig. 5B,lanes 11, 13, and 14), whereas Ala substitution of the rest of the KIM amino acids (mutations Q226A, E227A, S231A, S234A, T236A, and D238A) did not affect the binding (lanes 6, 7, 12,15, 17, and 19). The Ser231 KIM residue is located within a phosphorylation consensus sequence for PKA. To test the putative effect of phosphorylation of this residue on the association with ERK1/2, Ser231 was substituted with Glu (mutant S231E) (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, the GST-PTP-SL-(147–288) S231E fusion protein was unable to precipitate ERK1/2 (Fig. 5D,lane 6), suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser231 could play a negative role in the regulation of the interaction of PTP-SL with ERK1/2. In vitro kinase assays with EGF-activated HA-ERK2, using the GST-PTP-SL KIM mutants as substrates, showed that all the mutants that failed to associate with ERK1/2 were poorly phosphorylated by the kinase at Thr253 (Fig. 6; data not shown), confirming our previous finding that docking through the KIM is a prerequisite for ERK1/2 to phosphorylate PTP-SL. A summary of the association of ERK1/2 with the panel of PTP-SL KIM mutants is shown in Fig. 7A. ERK1 and ERK2 translocate to the nucleus upon cell stimulation with growth factors. To study the subcellular location of ERK2 in the presence of PTP-SL, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with HA-ERK2 and PTP-SL, followed by two-color immunofluorescence analysis. Under the normal growing conditions of COS-7 cells (5% fetal calf serum), HA-ERK2 was distributed in both the nucleus and the perinuclear area (Fig. 8A,inset). Upon coexpression with cytosolic, non-transmembrane PTP-SL (PTP-SL-(147–549)), HA-ERK2 was retained in the cytoplasm, being excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 8, A and C). An identical effect was observed upon coexpression with the PTP-SL-(147–549) C480S catalytically inactive mutant (Fig. 8,G and I), indicating that cytoplasmic retention of ERK2 is independent of the catalytic activity of PTP-SL. Remarkably, coexpression with the PTP-SL mutant lacking the KIM (PTP-SL-(147–549)ΔKIM) did not affect the nuclear location of HA-ERK2 (Fig. 8, D and F). Coexpression of HA-ERK2 with transmembrane PTP-SL (PTP-SL-(1–549)) also resulted in exclusion of HA-ERK2 from the nucleus and its accumulation in perinuclear areas in the cytoplasm, where PTP-SL-(1–549) is mainly located, likely as a result of its accumulation during biosynthesis (data not shown). Our results demonstrate that the in vivoassociation of PTP-SL with ERK2 through the KIM retains this kinase in the cytoplasm and blocks its entry into the nucleus. Cell type- and stimulus-specific MAP kinase activation is tightly regulated in vivo. Thus, in mammalian cells, differential activation of MAP kinases commits the cells to proliferation, growth arrest, and differentiation or apoptotic death (8Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin.

Specific regulation of the MAP kinase signaling cascades is achieved by the physical and functional assembly of regulatory and effector molecules, including cell-surface receptors, GTP-binding proteins, adapter proteins, kinases, and phosphatases (36Ro"

Using a sequence-based motif search, we have identified the third intracellular loop of the opioid receptor family as a possible direct contact point for interaction with CaM, in addition to its established role in G protein activation. Peptides derived from the third intracellular loop of the μ-opioid (OP3) receptor strongly bound CaM and were able to reduce binding interactions observed between CaM and immunopurified OP3 receptor. Functionally, CaM reduced basal and agonist-stimulated35S-labeled guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate incorporation, a measure of G protein activation, in membranes containing recombinant OP3receptor. Changes in CaM membrane levels as a result of overexpression or antisense CaM suppression inversely affected basal and agonist-induced G protein activation. The ability of CaM to abolish high affinity binding sites of an agonist at OP3 further supports the hypothesis of a direct interaction between CaM and opioid receptors. An OP3 receptor mutant with a Lys273→ Ala substitution (K273A-OP3), an amino acid predicted to play a critical role in CaM binding based on motif structure, was found to be unaffected by changes in CaM levels but coupled more efficiently to G proteins than the wild-type receptor. Stimulation of both the OP1 (δ-opioid) and OP3 wild-type receptors, but not the K273A-OP3 mutant, induced release of CaM from the plasma membrane. These results suggest that CaM directly competes with G proteins for binding to opioid receptors and that CaM may itself serve as an independent second messenger molecule that is released upon receptor stimulation.

Mapping relationships between the multitude of enzymes regulated by CaM is essential to the understanding of biochemical cascades linked to activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). While previous studies have revealed broad involvement of CaM in downstream signaling pathways initiated by G protein-coupled receptors, progress is also being made toward uncovering interactions more proximal to the receptor. Recent examples include the discovery of a CaM binding site on a G protein β-subunit (8Liu M. Yu B. Nakanishi O. Wieland T. Simon M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18801-18807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and another report that describes a CaM binding site on the metabotropic glutamate subtype 5 receptor (9Minakami R. Jinnai N. Sugiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20291-20298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The CaM binding domain found on the metabotropic glutamate subtype 5 receptor is located in the extended C-terminal region and appears unique to this receptor. Whereas core regions of the receptor involved in G protein coupling have not been previously implicated in CaM interactions, circumstantial evidence suggests such an involvement of CaM at the receptor level. The ability of certain CaM-binding peptides, like mastoparan and mellitin, to activate Gα as well, in essence substituting for the receptor (10Higashijima T. Burnier J. Ross E.M. J. Biol.

In this report, we identify an i3 loop region within receptors of the opioid family, in particular OP1 and OP3, as a potential site for CaM interaction. We also demonstrate that CaM inversely affects G protein coupling by OP1 and OP3 and propose that CaM itself could function as an independent second messenger molecule. Peptides corresponding to sections of the i3 loop of the OP3 receptor (see Table I) were prepared on an Applied Biosystems 433A automated peptide synthesizer (Foster City, CA) usingpara-methylbenzylhydramine resin and standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase methods.

The FLAG epitope was attached to N terminus of the hOP3 receptor (18Wang J.B. Johnson P.S. Persico A.M. Hawkins A.L. Griffin C.A. Uhl G.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the oligonucleotides 5′-GCTCTAGAGCTTAGGGCAACGGAGCAGTTTC-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGGATGGACTACAAGGACGATGATGACAAGGACAGCAGCGCTGCCCCCACGAAC-3′. The amplified PCR product was subcloned into the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), using HindIII and XbaI. Mutation of Lys273 to Ala in the i3 loop region of the FLAG-hOP3 receptor was accomplished using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and confirmed by DNA sequencing (Biomolecular Resource Center, University of California San Francisco). Gel mobility shift assays involving CaM and test peptides were performed using 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis essentially as described by Liuet al. (19Liu J. Conklin B.R. Blin N. Yun J. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11642-11646Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Briefly, 60 μm of purified CaM (Calbiochem) was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with test peptides dissolved in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA. Proteins were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Dansylation of CaM was performed as described by Kincaidet al. (20Kincaid R.L. Vaughan M. Osborne Jr., J.C. Tkachuk V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10638-10643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission spectra of dansylated CaM (dansyl-CaM) were measured from 400 to 600 nm using a Fluorolog Series 2 spectrofluorometer (SPEX, Edison, NJ) and an excitation wavelength of 340 nm. Test peptides were added to 0.6 μm dansyl-CaM in the absence or presence of 200 μm Ca2+ in 10 mm HEPES pH 7.0 buffer. Interactions between i3 loop peptides and dansyl-CaM were also examined indirectly by measuring test peptide-induced changes in fluorescence intensity of dansyl-CaM complexed with Ca2+/CaM-KII-(290–309) (21De Lean A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in a Fluostar '97 fluorimeter, equipped with microinjectors (BMG Lab Technologies, Durham NC). Samples were divided evenly into solid white 96-well microtiter plates (135 μl/well) containing 150 nm dansyl-CaM, 100 nm Ca2+/CaM-KII-(290–309), and test peptide. Fluorescence intensity was recorded at 100-ms intervals using an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and emission of 490 nm. Ten consecutive steady-state base-line observations were averaged for each peptide using Ca2+-free buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 μm EGTA), and replicates of each averaged value were combined. Concentration-response curves were plotted using a logistic curve-fitting equation as described by De Lean et al. (21De Lean A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the effect of adding Ca2+ was determined on the competition between test peptides, Ca2+/CaM-KII-(290–309), and dansyl-CaM. Using the same starting conditions outlined above, base-line measurements were then followed by an injection of 15 μl of a 0.11 mmCaCl2 solution yielding a final free [Ca2+] of ∼10 μm in 150 μl. Changes in fluorescence intensity were monitored at 100-ms intervals for 18 s. In the absence of dansyl-CaM, no fluorescence was observed under any condition. In the presence of dansyl-CaM alone, Ca2+injection caused a reproducible increase in fluorescence that reached maximum intensity within 200 ms and then remained at that new plateau level. When a mixture of Ca2+/CaM-KII-(290–309) and dansyl-CaM was injected with Ca2+ (in the absence of test peptides), there was an increase in fluorescence intensity that peaked within 200 ms, followed by an exponential decay in fluorescence intensity, which reflects the kinetic interaction of Ca2+/CaM-KII-(290–309) with dansyl-CaM in its altered Ca2+-bound form. The ability of peptides to inhibit the decay in fluorescence intensity was used as an indication of the test peptide's ability to disrupt formation of this new complex between dansyl-CaM and Ca2+/CaM-KII-(290–309), providing an indirect measure of relative binding potency in the presence of Ca2+ and plotted as percentage change in fluorescence intensity (Ff/Fi × 100), whereFi is the average fluorescence intensity between 200 and 700 ms after injection of Ca2+ and Ff is the average fluorescence intensity between 15.8 and 17.7 s after injection. HEK-FLAG-mOP3 cells or pRC/CMV empty vector-transfected HEK293 control cells were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 1 mmKH2PO4, 10 mm NaHPO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl) and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min, and the membrane pellet was solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C with 1% NP40 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 (Buffer A), containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). This mixture was then centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was concentrated to 110 its volume using an Ultrafree centrifugal filter with a nominal molecular weight limit of 50 kDa. Concentrated supernatant was diluted 10-fold in buffer A to reduce the concentration of NP40 to 0.1%, and solubilized material was incubated with 110 volume of anti-FLAG mAb (M2) affinity gel (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The gel was then washed with buffer A plus 0.1% NP40, and FLAG-mOP3 receptor was eluted by adding 400 μm FLAG peptide and incubating at room temperature for 30 min. FLAG peptide was removed by three cycles of concentration and dilution. Immunopurified FLAG-mOP3receptor was then incubated with 20 μl of immobilized bovine CaM affinity gel (Calbiochem) for 1 h at 4 °C in buffer A plus 0.1% NP40 and 1 mm CaCl2. The resin was pelleted and washed three times with buffer A plus 0.1% NP40 and 1 mm CaCl2 for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples were then eluted by incubating with 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer at 65 °C for 5 min. FLAG-mOP3 receptor was separated on 8% SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot using rabbit anti-OP3 receptor C-terminal antiserum (Incstar, Stillwater, MN), followed by an AP color development kit (Bio-Rad). HEK-FLAG-mOP3 cells or pRC/CMV vector-transfected HEK cells were solubilized in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1% NP40 and a protease inhibitor mixture. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then gently agitated for 9 h at 4 °C with 3 μg of anti-FLAG mAb (M2) (Sigma) and 75 μl of a 20% slurry of washed protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); total volume was 0.7 ml. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation, washed three times with PBS plus 0.1% NP40, and gently mixed with 2.2 μg of biotinylated CaM (Calbiochem) in 300 μl of PBS and 0.1% NP40 for 2 h at 4 °C, either in the presence of 1 mmCaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA. Beads were then washed with PBS containing 0.1% NP40 (with CaCl2 or EGTA), dissolved in 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Biotinylated CaM was detected using an AP-conjugated avidin and an AP color development kit. cDNA encoding chicken type II CaM (from Dr. Anthony R. Means of Duke University (22Putkey J.A. Ts'ui K.F. Tanaka T. Lagacé L. Stein J.P. Lai E.C. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11864-11870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was subcloned into pcDNA3, Zeo(+)/pcDNA3 (sense CaM), and Zeo(−)/pcDNA3 (antisense CaM) usingBamHI and XbaI. (Amino acid sequences of chicken and mammalian CaMs are identical.) Transfection of HEK-rOP3 cells was accomplished by using Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). The senseCaM-pcDNA3 construct was used for transient expression, and cells were harvested after 36 h. Stable cell lines were established with CaM-Zeo(+)/pcDNA3 (sense) orCaM-Zeo(−)/pcDNA3 (antisense) plasmids with 400 μg/ml ZeocinTM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for initial selection and then lowering the concentration of ZeocinTM to 100 μg/ml once established. Expression levels of rOP3receptor, determined with [3H]diprenorphine as described earlier, were not measurably altered by changes in CaM expression. Plasma membranes were prepared as described by Nehmad et al. (23Nehmad R. Nadler H. Simantov R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 22: 389-394PubMed Google Scholar). CaM was then extracted from the plasma membrane fractions, containing approximately 70% of total [3H]naloxone binding sites, and CaM levels were determined by measuring phosphodiesterase activity using [3H]cAMP as described previously (24Thompson W.J. Appleman M.M. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Standard curves were generated with known quantities of purified CaM (Sigma), with correlation coefficients ranging between 0.95 and 0.98. CaM recovery over the assay procedure was 65–68%. Results were confirmed by Western blot analysis. Membranes for [35S]GTPγS binding assays were prepared from cells washed with PBS and then homogenized in 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, in the absence (control membranes) or presence of 2 mm EGTA (EGTA-washed membranes), incubated on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Thus, washing in pH 8/EGTA buffer serves to reduce the CaM content of the membranes (23Nehmad R. Nadler H. Simantov R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 22: 389-394PubMed Google Scholar). Pellets were then resuspended briefly in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, centrifuged, and used for the [35S]GTPγS binding assay as described by Burfordet al. (25Burford N.T. Tolbert L.M. Sadee W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 342: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Membranes for binding studies, prepared as described above for [35S]GTPγS binding assays, were suspended in 10 mm HEPES buffer containing 10 mmMgCl2 and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Morphine (final concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 μm) and 1 nm [3H]naloxone (specific activity 69 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to each membrane sample (containing ∼20 μg of protein/sample), incubated for 2 h at room temperature, filtered, and washed at 4 °C, and filter-bound [3H]naloxone was determined by scintillation counting (13Arden J.R. Segredo V. Wang Z. Lameh J. Sadée W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1636-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Where indicated, membranes were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with 60 μm CaM, and then diluted 4 times before [3H]naloxone binding was determined. Binding curves were analyzed using one- or two-site models by GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA). cAMP measurements were performed by radioimmunoassay as described elsewhere (13Arden J.R. Segredo V. Wang Z. Lameh J. Sadée W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1636-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Cell suspensions were incubated with 10 μm forskolin for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of various concentrations of morphine (0–1 μm). Binding of CaM to CaM-binding proteins does not involve a universal, conserved sequence motif (26O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar); therefore, it remains difficult to define CaM binding domains in distinct protein families using sequence alignment data. To identify possible CaM binding domains in GPCRs, we used a series of sequence motifs derived from distinct protein families with known CaM binding domains for a PatScan (27Dsouza M. Larson N. Overbeek R. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 487-498Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (240) Google Scholar) pattern search of the SwissProt protein data base. Scanning for possible binding motifs produced matches within a number of known CaM-binding proteins and a limited number of additional proteins, including GPCR sequences located in the i3 loop. Among these, the opioid receptors emerged with several motif searches showing similarities to myosin light chain kinases, Ca2+/CaM kinases, and phosphodiesterases. Shown in Fig. 1 are representative alignments, with key motif residues underlined, suggesting the possibility that the i3 loop might interact not only with G proteins (10Higashijima T. Burnier J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14176-14186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Liu J. Conklin B.R. Blin N. Yun J. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 351-358PubMed Google Scholar) but also with CaM. The proposed site for interaction with CaM in the i3 loop of opioid receptor was first examined by observing mobility shifts of CaM using nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (8Liu M. Yu B. Nakanishi O. Wieland T. Simon M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18801-18807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). CaM was incubated in varying molar ratios with selected peptides derived from the sequence of the OP3 receptor i3 loop (TableI; Fig. 2A). Three peptides containing the C-terminal portion of the i3 loop predicted to interact with CaM, namely i3-1, i3-2, and i3-3, caused a notable shift in the electrophoretic mobility of CaM, whereas the N-terminal peptide i3-4 did not (Fig. 2A). The small gel shift caused by the low mass C-terminal i3-1 peptide is better visualized in Fig. 2B. These results indicate that the C-terminal portion of the OP3 receptor i3 loop is a suitable candidate for interaction with CaM. Mobility shifts were not observed in the absence of Ca2+ (not shown), suggesting that peptide-CaM interactions are strengthened in the presence of Ca2+. In contrast to mobility shifts observed with Ca2+/CaM kinase II-(290–309) or -(281–309), which were complete at molar ratios of 1:1 (Table I), shifts in CaM mobility caused by i3 loop peptides were incomplete even at substantially higher ratios. The i3-2 peptide, which lacks the N-terminal portion of the i3 loop, for example, produced a visible gel shift only at a 100-fold excess over CaM (Fig. 2A). The inability of i3 loop peptides to cause a complete shift in CaM under these conditions is similar to results reported for peptides derived from the CaM binding region of the metabotropic glutamate subtype 5 receptor (9Minakami R. Jinnai N. Sugiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20291-20298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Since motif analysis indicated that Lys273 of the OP3 receptor may be important for binding interaction with CaM, two modified i3-1 peptides (one in which the N-terminal Lys is removed (i3-5) and another in which Lys is replaced with Ala (i3-6)) were also synthesized and tested (Fig. 2B, Table I). Both of these modified peptides failed to induce mobility shifts of CaM, demonstrating that modifications to this critical residue can affect the ability of i3 loop peptides to interact with CaM. Shifts in the mobility of Ca2+/CaM kinase II peptides reflect the strong interaction that occurs with CaM, consistent with previous reports (30Payne M.E. Fong Y.L. Ono T. Colbran R.J. Kemp B.E. Soderling T.R. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7190-7195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, several peptides representing mostly the autophosphorylation substrate domain of Ca2+/CaM kinases failed to shift CaM. Moreover, autocamtide-2 and mastoparan, two peptides with sequence motifs and predicted secondary structures resembling those of CaM binding domains also failed to shift the CaM band (Table I), although mastoparan is known to bind to CaM with high affinity when determined by fluorescence shifts of dansylated CaM (11Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 114: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This suggests that unlike the i3 loop peptides, binding stability of mastoparan to CaM appears insufficient to induce a detectable shift in this gel assay. CaM binding of i3 loop peptides was also examined by measuring changes in the dansyl-CaM fluorescence spectrum (20Kincaid R.L. Vaughan M. Osborne Jr., J.C. Tkachuk V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10638-10643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The i3-3 peptide, which represents the amino acid sequence of the entire OP3receptor i3 loop, caused the largest change of dansyl-CaM fluorescence among the i3 loop peptides tested, and changes in fluorescence intensity occurred both in the presence and absence of Ca2+(Fig. 3A). This suggests that i3-3 is capable of inducing a substan"

The metal-binding sites may be involved in MNK trafficking and/or copper-translocating activity. In this study, we report the detailed functional analysis in mammalian cells of recombinant human MNK and its mutants with various metal-binding sites altered by site-directed mutagenesis. The results of the study, both in vitro and in vivo, provide evidence that the metal-binding sites of MNK are not essential for the ATP-dependent copper-translocating activity of MNK. Moreover, metal-binding site mutations, which resulted in a loss of ability of MNK to traffick to the plasma membrane, produced a copper hyperaccumulating phenotype. Using an in vitro vesicle assay, we demonstrated that the apparent Km and Vmax values for the wild type MNK and its mutants were not significantly different. The results of this study suggest that copper-translocating activity of MNK and its copper-induced relocalization to the plasma membrane represent a well coordinated copper homeostasis system. It is proposed that mutations in MNK which alter either its catalytic activity or/and ability to traffick can be the cause of Menkes disease.

Mutations in the MNK gene cause Menkes disease, a disorder associated with systemic copper deficiency, which is believed to be because of low copper absorption from the small intestine (4Danks D.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.V. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2211-2235Google Scholar). Severe neurodegenerative and connective tissue disorders observed in Menkes patients are thought to be caused by partial or complete loss of catalytic activity of essential cuproenzymes (4Danks D.M.

Metal Ions in Gene Regulation.

Odermatt A. Krapf R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Among these are heavy metal-transporting Cu+/2+ and Cd2+ ATPases (7Møller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). A unique feature of copper-transporting P-type ATPases is the presence of putative metal-binding site(s) (MBS), GMCXXC, in the N-terminal region: one in bacteriaEnterococcus hirae (CopB), two in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Ccc2p), three in nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans (8Sambongi Y.

The GMCXXC motif is also present in the putative copper chaperones Atox1 and Atx1, which have been proposed to deliver copper to MNK and Ccc2p, respectively, via a ligand exchange mechanism (10Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.-J. Schmidt P. Cizewski-Culotta V. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar).Several studies have been conducted in an attempt to elucidate the role of MBSs. Lutsenko et al. (11Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of MNK binds six atoms of copper per molecule, suggesting each MBS binds one copper. By progressively mutating the MBS of MNK, Payne et al. (12Payne A.S. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3765-3770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that MBSs 3–6 are required to complement the ΔCCC2 phenotype in S. cerevisiae. In contrast, Iida et al. (13Iida M. Terada K. Sambongi Y. Wakabayashi T. Miura N. Koyama K. Futai M. Sugiyama T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) have shown that only MBS 6 in WND was required to rescue the ΔCCC2 phenotype. Vulpe, et al. (14Vulpe C. Yuan D. Ibom V. Gitschier J. Copper and Zinc Receptors in Signalling, Trafficking and Disease. ASBMB, Granlibakken, Lake Tahoe, CA1997: 35Google Scholar) have provided evidence that the ΔCCC2 phenotype can be complemented by mutant forms of Ccc2p, but at least one MBS was required. In contrast, it has been shown that the mutation of the only MBS in the cadmium-transporting P-type ATPase in Staphylococcus aureus (CadA) reduced but did not abolish the catalytic activity of the protein, suggesting that the single MBS was not essential for the translocation of cadmium (15Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Transport Processes in Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Organisms. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1996: 3-4Google Scholar).An important aspect of MNK physiology is that copper regulates the intracellular location of the protein (16Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). MNK normally resides in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (16Petris M.J.

Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). We have proposed, therefore, that MNK can maintain copper homeostasis by means of vesicular trafficking and ATP-dependent copper-translocating activity (16Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G.

An important yet unanswered question is whether the processes of MNK trafficking and copper-translocating activity are co-dependent or independent events.The studies presented in this paper provide the first direct evidence of catalytic activity of human MNK and its variants with mutated MBSs expressed in mammalian cells. Recently we demonstrated that mammalian MNK translocates copper across membranes in vitro, and this is ATP-dependent (20Voskoboinik I. Brooks H. Smith S. Shen P. Camakaris J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this paper we used a similarin vitro system to demonstrate that MBSs are not essential for copper-translocating activity of MNK. Moreover, studies using whole cells demonstrated that mutations in MBSs 4–6 or all six MBSs resulted in a copper-accumulating phenotype. This phenomenon coincided with the inability of the same mutant proteins to traffick to the PM in response to copper (19Strausak D. La Fontaine S. Hill J. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Mercer J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11170-11177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results indicate that MNK trafficking and copper-translocating activity are integral components of intracellular copper homeostasis.DISCUSSIONThe present study provides the first detailed functional analysis of N-terminal putative copper-binding motifs (MBS) of MNK in mammalian cells by studying mutants where these motifs have been altered by site-directed mutagenesis. The overexpression of the normal and mutant MNKs enabled us to analyze the kinetics of MNK-mediated copper translocation using an in vitro vesicle assay. The results have shown that putative MBSs in the N-terminal domain of MNK were not essential for copper-translocating activity of MNK, as all the mutated proteins investigated retained their ATP-dependent copper-translocating activity (Table I, Fig. 4).The in vivo results (Fig. 5 and 6) are particularly noteworthy and are consistent with the retention of copper transport activity of the mutant MNKs in vitro, but those mutants which have lost the ability to traffick in response to copper (115 and 116) actually lead to enhanced copper accumulation in whole cells relative to the EV control. We suggest that this is a result of these mutant MNK proteins transporting copper into an intracellular compartment, presumably the TGN, from where there is little or no copper-regulated trafficking of MNK to the PM (19Strausak D. La Fontaine S. Hill J. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Mercer J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11170-11177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and thus is substantially reducing copper efflux from these cells. The small reduction in 64Cu accumulation in mutant 115 (6 h, 189 μm copper; Fig. 5) may be because of copper efflux occurring as a consequence of a constitutive (copper-independent) recycling pool of catalytically active MNK (16Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Given the low expression of MNK in 115 cells (compared with 116), such a pool would be proportionately higher relative to the pool of catalytically active MNK that does not traffick in response to copper.The role of putative MBSs in the N terminus of MNK and other copper-transporting ATPases and in particular “the reason” for the six MBSs in the mammalian copper ATPases is not understood. Previous studies utilizing yeast complementation assays have suggested, in contrast to our results, that the MBSs are needed for the copper-transporting activity of MNK, WND, and Ccc2p (Refs. 12Payne A.S. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3765-3770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 13Iida M. Terada K. Sambongi Y. Wakabayashi T. Miura N. Koyama K. Futai M.

The yeast system involves an indirect measurement of the activity of MNK, WND, and Ccc2p through ability to form the [Fet 3-Cu] complex (12Payne A.S. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3765-3770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 13Iida M. Terada K. Sambongi Y. Wakabayashi T. Miura N. Koyama K. Futai M. Sugiyama T.

ASBMB, Granlibakken, Lake Tahoe, CA1997: 35Google Scholar) in copper-deficient medium. Mutations of MNK or WND could reduce, but not abolish, their catalytic activities (as reported in this paper), but the reduced activity may be insufficient to complement the ΔCCC2 phenotype. In addition, MBSs may be required to scavenge and concentrate the low amounts of copper present used in the yeast ΔCCC2 complementation assay. It is noteworthy that, using a direct assay on the Cd2+-transporting P-type ATPase CadA in S. aureus, Nucifora et al. (26Nucifora G. Chu L. Misra T.K. Silver S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3544-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) demonstrated that this protein contains only one MBS, and the mutations of cysteines in the sequence GFTCANC reduced but did not abolish the rates of Cd2+ transport (15Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Transport Processes in Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Organisms. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1996: 3-4Google Scholar). Therefore it is clear that the metal-binding sites are required for some of the functions carried out by these enzymes, but our in vitro results show that copper translocation is possible without the N-terminal CXXC motifs. It is not possible to reconcile the results from the different groups at this stage. However, one should also consider the possibility that there may be a number of modes of delivery of copper to the ion channel, one involving the MBSs and another MBS independent, and the various assays are measuring these distinct modes of presentation.Related to this point is the involvement of copper chaperones,e.g. Atx1 in yeast and Atox1 in humans, in the delivery of copper to the enzymes. The inability of MBS mutants 115 and 116 to traffick, while being catalytically active suggests that one of the roles of MBSs is copper binding, possibly via the [Atox 1-Cu+] complex, followed by the recognition of copper-loaded MNK by the vesicle-assembling system. In the in vitro system described here, it is possible DTT functioned not only as a reducing agent for copper, but also as a copper chaperone as it can bind copper (27Kachur A.V. Held K.D. Koch C.J. Biaglow J.E. Radiat. Res. 1997; 147: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) in a complex similar to the CXXC motif (the structure of DTT is HS-CH2(CHOH)2CH2SH). One can argue that there is a potential for copper to bypass MBS(s) and be delivered to the channel directly, especially in MBS mutants and this may be the mechanism in cells exposed to high copper. As copper translocation for all the MNK proteins tested was stimulated by ATP and inhibited by orthovanadate, this direct delivery still has the properties of a P-type ATPase transport system.In conclusion, our studies provide biochemical and physiological evidence that MBSs of human MNK are not important for its catalytic activity, but the presence of at least MBS 4, 5, and 6, which may function as sensors for copper, appears to be essential for copper-regulated trafficking (19Strausak D. La Fontaine S. Hill J. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Mercer J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11170-11177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Copper-translocating activity and copper-stimulated trafficking of MNK together represent a finely tuned regulated intracellular copper homeostasis system. The current findings suggest that MNK can perform its physiological role in detoxification of copper and in the absorption of copper from small intestine into the blood stream only when the both functions are intact. It can be predicted that mutations, which result in the loss of catalytic activity and/or copper-stimulated trafficking ability of MNK, would result in copper accumulation and, potentially, Menkes disease.

Mutations in the MNK gene cause Menkes disease, a disorder associated with systemic copper deficiency, which is believed to be because of low copper absorption from the small intestine (4Danks D.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.V. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2211-2235Google Scholar). Severe neurodegenerative and connective tissue disorders observed in Menkes patients are thought to be caused by partial or complete loss of catalytic activity of essential cuproenzymes (4Danks D.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.V. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2211-2235Google Scholar, 5Mercer J.F.B. Camakaris J. Silver S. Walden W. Metal Ions in Gene Regulation. Chapman and Hall, New York1997: 250-276Google Scholar). The cDNA-derived amino acid sequence of the MNK protein reveals significant structural similarity with transmembrane P-type ATPases, a common class of cation-transporting transmembrane proteins (6Solioz M. Odermatt A. Krapf R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Among these are heavy metal-transporting Cu+/2+ and Cd2+ ATPases (7Møller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). A unique feature of copper-transporting P-type ATPases is the presence of putative metal-binding site(s) (MBS), GMCXXC, in the N-terminal region: one in bacteriaEnterococcus hirae (CopB), two in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Ccc2p), three in nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans (8Sambongi Y.

Biochem (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and six in mammals (MNK and Wilson protein, WND) (9Koch K.A.O. Pena M.M. Thiele D.J. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 549-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The GMCXXC motif is also present in the putative copper chaperones Atox1 and Atx1, which have been proposed to deliver copper to MNK and Ccc2p, respectively, via a ligand exchange mechanism (10Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.-J. Schmidt P. Cizewski-Culotta V. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Several studies have been conducted in an attempt to elucidate the role of MBSs. Lutsenko et al. (11Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of MNK binds six atoms of copper per molecule, suggesting each MBS binds one copper. By progressively mutating the MBS of MNK, Payne et al. (12Payne A.S. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3765-3770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that MBSs 3–6 are required to complement the ΔCCC2 phenotype in S. cerevisiae. In contrast, Iida et al. (13Iida M. Terada K. Sambongi Y. Wakabayashi T. Miura N. Koyama K. Futai M. Sugiyama T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) have shown that only MBS 6 in WND was required to rescue the ΔCCC2 phenotype. Vulpe, et al. (14Vulpe C. Yuan D. Ibom V. Gitschier J. Copper and Zinc Receptors in Signalling, Trafficking and Disease. ASBMB, Granlibakken, Lake Tahoe, CA1997: 35Google Scholar) have provided evidence that the ΔCCC2 phenotype can be complemented by mutant forms of Ccc2p, but at least one MBS was required. In contrast, it has been shown that the mutation of the only MBS in the cadmium-transporting P-type ATPase in Staphylococcus aureus (CadA) reduced but did not abolish the catalytic activity of the protein, suggesting that the single MBS was not essential for the translocation of cadmium (15Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Transport Processes in Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Organisms. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1996: 3-4Google Scholar). An important aspect of MNK physiology is that copper regulates the intracellular location of the protein (16Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). MNK normally resides in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (16Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 17Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Suzuki M. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genet. 1997; 6: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), but the elevation of extracellular concentrations of copper results in translocation of MNK from the TGN to the plasma membrane (PM), thus presumably facilitating copper efflux (16Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). We have proposed, therefore, that MNK can maintain copper homeostasis by means of vesicular trafficking and ATP-dependent copper-translocating activity (16Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G.

It is noteworthy that, using a direct assay on the Cd2+-transporting P-type ATPase CadA in S. aureus, Nucifora et al. (26Nucifora G. Chu L. Misra T.K. Silver S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3544-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) demonstrated that this protein contains only one MBS, and the mutations of cysteines in the sequence GFTCANC reduced but did not abolish the rates of Cd2+ transport (15Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Transport Processes in Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Organisms. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1996: 3-4Google Scholar). Therefore it is clear that the metal-binding sites are required for some of the functions carried out by these enzymes, but our in vitro results show that copper translocation is possible without the N-terminal CXXC motifs. It is not possible to reconcile the results from the different groups at this stage. However, one should also consider the possibility that there may be a number of modes of delivery of copper to the ion channel, one involving the MBSs and another MBS independent, and the various assays are measuring these distinct modes of presentation. Related to this point is the involvement of copper chaperones,e.g. Atx1 in yeast and Atox1 in humans, in the delivery of copper to the enzymes. The inability of MBS mutants 115 and 116 to traffick, while being catalytically active suggests that one of the roles of MBSs is copper binding, possibly via the [Atox 1-Cu+] complex, followed by the recognition of copper-loaded MNK by the vesicle-assembling system. In the in vitro system described here, it is possible DTT functioned not only as a reducing agent for copper, but also as a copper chaperone as it can bind copper (27Kachur A.V. Held K.D. Koch C.J. Biaglow J.E. Radiat. Res. 1997; 147: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) in a complex similar to the CXXC motif (the structure of DTT is HS-CH2(CHOH)2CH2SH). One can argue that there is a potential for copper to bypass MBS(s) and be delivered to the channel directly, especially in MBS mutants and this may be the mechanism in cells exposed to high copper. As copper translocation for all the MNK proteins tested was stimulated by ATP and inhibited by orthovanadate, this direct delivery still has the properties of a P-type ATPase transport system. In conclusion, our studies provide biochemical and physiological evidence that MBSs of human MNK are not important for its catalytic activity, but the presence of at least MBS 4, 5, and 6, which may function as sensors for copper, appears to be essential for copper-regulated trafficking (19Strausak D. La Fontaine S. Hill J. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Mercer J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11170-11177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Copper-translocating activity and copper-stimulated trafficking of MNK together represent a finely tuned regulated intracellular copper homeostasis system. The current findings suggest that MNK can perform its physiological role in detoxification of copper and in the absorption of copper from small intestine into the blood stream only when the both functions are intact. It can be predicted that mutations, which result in the loss of catalytic activity and/or copper-stimulated trafficking ability of MNK, would result in copper accumulation and, potentially, Menkes disease.

We examined the ability of wild-type NPC1 and NPC1 mutants to correct the NPC sterol trafficking defect and their subcellular localization in CT60 cells. Cells transfected with wild-type NPC1 expressed 170- and 190-kDa proteins. Tunicamycin treatment resulted in a 140-kDa protein, the deduced size of NPC1, suggesting that NPC1 is<i>N</i>-glycosylated. Mutation of all four asparagines in potential N-terminal <i>N</i>-glycosylation sites to glutamines resulted in a 20-kDa reduction of the expressed protein. Proteins with a single <i>N</i>-glycosylation site mutation localized to late endosome/lysosomal compartments, as did wild-type NPC1, and each corrected the cholesterol trafficking defect. However, mutation of all four potential <i>N</i>-glycosylation sites reduced ability to correct the NPC phenotype commensurate with reduced expression of the protein. Mutations in the putative sterol-sensing domain resulted in inactive proteins targeted to lysosomal membranes encircling cholesterol-laden cores. N-terminal leucine zipper motif mutants could not correct the NPC defect, although they accumulated in lysosomal membranes. We conclude that NPC1 is a glycoprotein that must have an intact sterol-sensing domain and leucine zipper motif for cholesterol-mobilizing activity."

We previously demonstrated that resuscitation with hypertonic salt solutions prevented the endotoxin-induced leukosequestration and consequent lung injury, and this effect was partially attributed to an altered surface expression of adhesion molecules, CD11b and L-selectin. In this study we investigated the mechanisms whereby osmotic stress evokes L-selectin shedding. The metalloprotease inhibitor RO 31-9790 prevented the osmotic down-regulation of L-selectin, indicating that this process was catalyzed by the same “sheddase” responsible for L-selectin cleavage induced by diverse inflammatory stimuli. The trigger for hypertonic shedding was cell shrinkage and not increased osmolarity, ionic strength, or intracellular pH. Volume reduction caused robust tyrosine phosphorylation and its inhibition by genistein and erbstatin abrogated shedding. Shrinkage stimulated tyrosine kinases Hck, Syk, and Pyk2, but prevention of their activation by the Src-family inhibitor PP1 failed to affect the L-selectin response. Hypertonicity elicited the Src family-independent activation of p38, and the inhibition of this kinase by SB203580 strongly reduced shedding. p38 was also essential for the N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine- and lipopolysaccharide-induced shedding but not the phorbol ester-induced shedding. Thus, cell volume regulates L-selectin surface expression in a p38-mediated, metalloprotease-dependent manner. Moreover, p38 has a central role in shedding induced by many inflammatory mediators.

Although neutrophils are indispensable for efficient host defense against invading microorganisms, their uncontrolled or excessive activation is a major contributor to disease. Thus, neutrophil-mediated tissue damage is a key pathologic factor in a variety of conditions including overwhelming infection, ischemia-reperfusion injury, or post-hemorrhage adult respiratory distress syndrome (1Wahl S.M. Feldman G.M. McCarthy J.B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Beal A.L. Cerra F.B. J. Am. Med.

It is therefore not surprising that a variety of approaches have been tried to mitigate neutrophil/endothelium interactions and neutrophil activation. Potential strategies for intervention include the blockade of adhesion molecules with specific antibodies (10Mulligan M.S. Miyasaka M. Tamatani T. Jones M.L. Ward P.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 832-840PubMed Google Scholar), the neutralization of the released tissue-toxic molecular species such as reactive oxygen intermediates (e.g. by antioxidants) (25Blackwell T.S. Blackwell T.R. Holden E.P. Christman B.W. Christman J.W. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1630-1637PubMed Google Scholar), and the interference with signaling pathways or membrane traffic involved in the potentially deleterious activation and degranulation of the cells. A novel example for this latter approach is the application of hypertonic salt solutions, which brings about an efficient, safe, and reversible suppression of numerous neutrophil functions (23Rizoli S.B. Kapus A. Fan J. Li Y.H. Marshall J.C. Rotstein O.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6288-6296PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kuchkina N.V. Orlov S.N. Pokudin N.I. Chuchalin A.G.

Using an animal model, we have recently shown that an elevation of serum osmolarity protected against neutrophil-mediated post-hemorrhage lung injury (23Rizoli S.B. Kapus A. Fan J. Li Y.H. Marshall J.C. Rotstein O.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6288-6296PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, hypertonicity prevented the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; FMLP, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PKC, protein kinase C; ATF-2, activated transcription factor; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis-[2-carboxyethyl]-5[and 6] carboxyfluorescein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; mAb, monoclonal antibody-induced up-regulation of CD11b and caused adhesion-independent shedding of L-selectinin vivo and in vitro (23Rizoli S.B.

Interference with proper neutrophil adhesion appears to have contributed significantly to the protective, anti-inflammatory effect of hypertonicity. To date, the cellular mechanisms underlying the neutrophil-suppressive effects of hyperosmolarity remained largely undefined. The primary aim of the present study was to explore the signaling pathways that might participate in the osmotic shedding of L-selectin. Because we and others have shown that hypertonicity triggers robust tyrosine phosphorylation in various cell types including neutrophils (23Rizoli S.B. Kapus A. Fan J. Li Y.H. Marshall J.C.

Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2768-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that osmosensitive kinases might be involved in this process. We therefore intended to further investigate which kinases are activated by osmotic stress in neutrophils and to assess their potential contribution to L-selectin shedding. Moreover, the signaling mechanisms leading to L-selectin cleavage upon exposure of the cells to inflammatory stimuli such as formyl peptides (FMLP) or LPS are also poorly understood. The involvement of protein kinase C-dependent and independent, presumably tyrosine kinase-dependent, mechanisms have been documented (17Frey M. Appenheimer M.M. Evans S.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5424-5434PubMed Google Scholar), but the relevant tyrosine kinases have not been identified. Thus, in addition to the specific osmolarity- or cell volume-related regulation of L-selectin expression, the present studies were performed to gain further insight into the general mechanisms responsible for the control of the surface expression of this adhesion molecule. Our results demonstrate that the trigger for the osmotic effect on L-selectin is cell shrinkage, which initiates a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent, metalloprotease-mediated cleavage of this adhesion molecule. In addition, p38 seem to play an important role in L-selectin shedding evoked by classical inflammatory stimuli as well.

Isolated neutrophils were suspended in either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Lab Inc) plus penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) or bicarbonate-free RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) buffered to pH 7.4 with 10 mm HEPES or isotonic saline buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Hypertonic medium (500 mosm) was obtained by the addition of extra 100 mm NaCl or 200 mm urea or sucrose into the isotonic medium. Surface L-selectin was determined by flow cytometry. Neutrophils were incubated with various inhibitors and exposed to iso- or hypertonicity as detailed under the figures. Subsequently, aliquots of cells were incubated at 1:10 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-L-selectin antibody for 20 min at 4 °C and analyzed on a FACScan (Becton-Dickison, Palo Alto, CA) using FL1 detector (488-nm excitation wavelengths). Typically, 5,000 cells were analyzed per condition. The number of positive cells was determined by comparison of histograms with those obtained using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated nonreactive antibody as described by Preece et al. (11Preece G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11634-11640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Soluble L-selectin was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from Bender MedSystems, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For cell volume determination neutrophils were suspended in various media as indicated under Fig. 3, and their volumes were assessed by electronic sizing using a Coulter Counter model ZM, equipped with a Channelyzer. For intracellular pH determination, 1 × 106neutrophils suspended in isotonic saline were incubated with 2 μm of BCECF for 15 min at 37 °C, sedimented, and resuspended in isotonic saline buffer in the presence or absence of 10 μm HOE694 for 1 min. The intracellular pH was monitored spectrofluorimetrically using a Perkin-Elmer fluorimeter as in Ref. 33Susztak K. Mocsai A. Ligeti E. Kapus A. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar. After obtaining a baseline reading, neutrophils were challenged with hypertonicity by the addition of 100 mm NaCl. Following specified treatments, the neutrophils were rapidly sedimented in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in hot Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 10 min. Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin. The membranes were then incubated with the corresponding antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. The dilution was 1:3000 for anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) and 1:1000 for anti-p38, anti-Syk, anti-Pyk2, and anti-Hck. After washing, the membranes were incubated with either peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:4000) and visualized using ECL. To minimize proteolysis, neutrophils were pretreated with 1 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate for 30 min, washed, and resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml in HEPES-buffered RPMI. After specific treatments, the same volume of ice-cold buffer of the corresponding osmolarity was added, and the cells were rapidly sedimented in a microcentrifuge. The cells were dissolved in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm HEPES, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 20 μl/ml proteinase inhibitor mixture. The lysate was kept in ice for 5 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C, and the Triton-insoluble pellet was discarded. The lysate was precleared and incubated with specific antibody for 2 h. Subsequently protein G-agarose beads (40 μl) were added, and the lysate was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Following centrifugation, the immune complexes were sedimented and washed three times with washing buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 150 mm NaCl) and then the precipitate was boiled in LSB (10% glycerol, 5% mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8) for 10 min. Following immunoprecipitation, the immune complexes were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase reaction mix containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 200 μmMgCl2, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 25 mm β-glycerolphosphate, pH 7.2, and 5 μg of recombinant fragment of ATF-2 for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated with hot LSB, and the samples were boiled for 10 min. Proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated ATF-2 was visualized by autoradiography. Neutrophils were incubated with specific inhibitors prior to challenge with iso- or hypertonic medium for 18 h at 37 °C. The cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in propidium iodide (500 ng/ml) and stored at 4 °C for 30 min. DNA fragmentation analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was scored by the appearance of a sub-G0 peak as described by Frasch et al.(34Frasch S.C. Nick J.A. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Worthen G.S. Henson P.M. J. Biol.

Data are presented as mean ± S.E. for n experiments as indicated with duplicate readings within each experiment. Blots are representative of at least three independent studies. Significance was assessed using one-way analysis of variance with posthoc testing using the Student-Newman-Keuls Multiple Comparisons Test. A probability of p < 0.05 was considered significant. To study the effect of hyperosmolarity on L-selectin expression, the tonicity of the medium containing 1 × 106 neutrophils was increased from 290 to 500 mosm by the addition of extra NaCl. After various times of hypertonic exposure, the cells were resuspended in isotonic medium and stained for L-selectin analysis by flow cytometry. Hypertonicity caused a significant, time-dependent reduction in L-selectin expression on the neutrophil surface (Fig. 1). In contrast to the rapid shedding of L-selectin, which occurs within minutes following receptor ligation or chemokine activation (2Walcheck B. Kahn J. Fisher J.M. Wang B.B. Fisk R.S. Payan D.G.

Upon stimulation, L-selectin is proteolytically cleaved yielding a soluble fragment (11Preece G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11634-11640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 12Kahn J. Ingraham R.H. Shirley F. Migaki G.I. Kishimoto T.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To confirm that the reduction in L-selectin expression was due to shedding, we determined soluble L-selectin in the supernatant of hypertonically challenged cells, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Hypertonicity (for 4 h) caused essentially the same increase in soluble L-selectin as a 20-min treatment with phorbol ester, a condition known to cause an almost complete shedding of L-selectin from neutrophils (11Preece G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11634-11640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) (not shown). Taken together, these data show that hypertonicity induces a gradual shedding of L-selectin that results in decreased cell surface expression. It has been proposed that a membrane-bound protease, referred to as L-selectin sheddase, is the common final pathway catalyzing the cleavage of L-selectin after exposure of the cells to a variety of inflammatory stimuli (11Preece G.

To determine whether hypertonicity-induced shedding of L-selectin is also mediated by this enzyme, a newly developed zinc-chelating hydroxamic acid derivative (RO 31-9790), reported to be a potent sheddase inhibitor was used (11Preece G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11634-11640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Consistent with its known activity, preincubation of cells with RO 31-9790 completely abolished the shedding of L-selectin induced by LPS, FMLP or the PKC stimulator PMA. Importantly, the drug was equally effective in preventing the hypertonicity-triggered L-selectin shedding. Specifically, the number of L-selectin-positive neutrophils remained at the level observed in the isotonically treated cells even after prolonged hypertonic incubation (Fig. 2). Because RO 31-9790 has been shown to exert inhibitory effects on matrix proteases (11Preece G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11634-11640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 15Feehan C. Darlak K. Kahn J. Walcheck B. Spatola A.F. Kishimoto T.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 41: 1209-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), one possible mechanism of its effect on shedding might have been through inhibition of soluble proteolytic factor(s) released in response to hypertonic exposure. To test this possibility, 1.66 × 106 neutrophils were incubated in 1 ml of hypertonic solution for 4 h and pelleted, and their supernatant was collected. After the supernatant was diluted 1.66-fold with water to reestablish isotonicity, it was then added to 1 × 106 fresh neutrophils for 4 h. The supernatant of hypertonically treated cells caused no shedding of L-selectin from the test neutrophils, arguing against the possibility that hypertonicity induced the release of a soluble proteolytic factor that cleaved L-selectin. To further demonstrate that shedding was not mediated by a matrix proteinase, we added EDTA to the medium, an intervention that selectively inhibits these enzymes without affecting L-selectin sheddase (13Arribas J. Coodly L. Vollmer P. Kishimoto T.K. Rose-John S. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11376-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 38Bazil V. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1314-1322PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of the cells with 5 mm EDTA had no effect on the hypertonicity-induced shedding (not shown). Together, these findings strongly support the notion that the L-selectin shedding caused by osmotic shrinkage is mediated by the same membrane-bound protease as that responsible for shedding after exposure to other stimuli. In addition to causing cell shrinkage, exposure to a hypertonic environment results in changes of intra- and extracellular osmotic concentration, ionic strength, and intracellular pH. The following experiments were designed to establish which of these variables is critical to trigger shedding. To separate the effect of cell shrinkage from that of medium osmolarity, we used incubation conditions that allowed manipulation of these parameters (30Krump E. Nikitas K. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17303-17311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 31Szaszi K. Buday L. Kapus A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16670-16678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Initially, the medium osmolarity was increased while maintaining the cell volume constant. This was achieved by the addition of 200 mm urea to the medium. Urea is a freely cell-permeant compound and thus rapidly equilibrates across the cell membrane, causing no cell shrinkage but increasing both intra- and extracellular osmolarity. In contrast to hypertonic NaCl, incubation of cells in urea did not alter neutrophil volume (Fig. 3B). Under the hyperosmolar but isovolemic conditions caused by urea, there was no shedding of L-selectin (Fig. 3A). To discern whether a rise in Na+ or Cl− concentration or ionic strength of the medium triggered L-selectin shedding, neutrophil shrinkage was induced by the addition of a nonionic osmolyte in the form of 200 mm sucrose. As shown in Fig. 3B, hypertonicity caused by the addition of 200 mm sucrose resulted in cell shrinkage of a magnitude similar to that observed with hypertonic NaCl (500 mosm) and also provoked a comparable degree of L-selectin shedding (Fig. 3A). These observations indicate that L-selectin shedding is related to a reduction in cell volume and not an increase in extracellular NaCl concentration or ionic strength. Shrinkage is known to stimulate Na+/H+exchanger 1, the isoform of the Na+/H+exchanger expressed in neutrophils leading to a rise in the intracellular pH of the shrunken cells (39Fukushima T. Waddell T.K. Grinstein S. Goss G.G. Orlowski J. Downey G.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1037-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether Na+/H+ exchanger 1-mediated cytosolic alkalization contributes to L-selectin shedding, we compared the effect of hypertonicity in the presence and absence of HOE694, a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the antiporter. As shown on Fig. 4A, hypertonicity caused a sizable cytosolic alkalization that was completely abolished by HOE694. However, HOE694 did not influence the hypertonicity-induced shedding of L-selectin (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the latter process is not caused by the shrinkage-induced alkalization. The combined results of these experiments demonstrate that volume reduction (shrinkage) is the critical factor triggering the osmotic shedding of L-selectin, regardless of changes in osmolarity, ionic strength, or the intracellular pH. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation in response to various inflammatory stimuli has been shown to be important in the regulation of surface adhesion molecule expression (40Lowell C. Fumagalli L.

As a prerequisite for these studies, it was necessary to determine which HA synthase (HAS), of three separate human genes capable of synthesizing HA, designated HAS-1, HAS-2, or HAS-3, is primarily responsible for HA synthesis in human articular chondrocytes. The copy number of each HAS mRNA expressed in cultured human articular chondrocytes was determined using quantitative (competitive) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Cultures of human articular chondrocytes and cartilage tissue slices were then transfected with HAS-2-specific antisense oligonucleotides. This treatment resulted in time-dependent inhibition of HAS-2 mRNA expression, as measured by quantitative RT-PCR, and a significant loss of cell-associated HA staining. Sense and reverse HAS-2 oligonucleotides showed no effect. The consequences of reduced HA levels (due to HAS-2 antisense inhibition) were a decrease in the diameter of the cell-associated matrix and a decreased capacity to retain newly synthesized proteoglycan.

These three genes display sequence homology and share common exon-intron boundaries between exons 2 and 3 (9Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1923-1932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), yet they are localized on separate chromosomes (10Spicer A.P. Seldin M.F. Olsen A.S. Brown N. Wells D.E. Doggett N.A. Itano N. Kimata K. Inazawa J. McDonald J.A. Genomics. 1997; 41: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Different cell types express different HAS enzymes. For example, in human dermal fibroblasts both HAS-1 and HAS-2 transcripts were expressed and both appeared to be regulated by transforming growth factor-β (11Sugiyama Y. Shimada A. Sayo T. Sakai S. Inoue S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 16-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These results suggest that HA synthesis may be regulated by the differential expression of these three HAS enzymes by a particular cell type or phenotype. The extracellular matrix of cartilage contains a small amount of HA. The predominant extracellular matrix components of cartilage are collagens, types II, IX, and XI, and proteoglycans such as aggrecan (12Kuettner K.E. Klippel J.H. Dieppe P.A. Rheumatology. Mosby-Year Book Europe, Ltd., 1994: 6.1-6.16Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the small amount of HA present plays an important, unique role in cartilage, serving to facilitate retention of aggrecan within the tissue. Often more than 50 aggrecan proteoglycan monomers become bound to a single filament of HA (13Buckwalter J.A. Rosenberg L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9830-9839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These HA-proteoglycan aggregates are maintained at high concentrations within the cartilage, giving the tissue its unique ability to resist compression. In addition, HA also facilitates the anchorage of HA-proteoglycan aggregates to the surface of the cells within cartilage, the chondrocytes. We have demonstrated that aggregates are tethered to the chondrocyte cell surface via interactions with CD44 HA receptors (14Knudson W. Knudson C.B. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 227-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Knudson C.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 16Knudson W. Aguiar D.J. Hua Q. Knudson C.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These same CD44 receptors also play a role in the internalization of extracellular HA leading to its degradation intracellularly, presumably within lysosomes (17Hua Q. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 365-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Degenerative events that occur in cartilage, many leading to irreversible disease states such as osteoarthritis, are believed to occur due to an imbalance between turnover (catabolism) and matrix biosynthesis (anabolism), particularly related to the content of aggrecan (12Kuettner K.E. Klippel J.H. Dieppe P.A. Rheumatology. Mosby-Year Book Europe, Ltd., 1994: 6.1-6.16Google Scholar). In fact, the content of aggrecan staining within cartilage is used as a criterion for disease diagnosis (i.e.safranin O staining criterion of the Mankin scale (18Mankin H.J. Dorfman H. Lippiello L. Zarins A. J. Bone Jt. Surg. Am. 1971; 53: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar)). However, as discussed above, the retention of proteoglycan is also dependent on the presence of optimal concentrations of HA as well as associated functional HA receptors such as CD44. Depletion of HA has been observed in early experimental osteoarthritis in dogs (19Pita J.C. Muller F.J. Manicourt D.H. Buckwalter J.A. Ratcliffe A. Kuettner K.E. Schleyerbach R. Peyron J.G. Hascall V.C. Articular Cartilage and Osteoarthritis. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992: 455-470Google Scholar). Reduced joint loading due to splint immobilization also resulted in a significant decrease in dog articular cartilage HA (20Haapala J. Lammi M.J. Inkinen R. Parkkinen J.J. Agren U.M. Arokoski J. Kiviranta I. Helminen H.J. Tammi M.I. J. Rheumatol. 1996; 22: 1586-1593Google Scholar). In the dog model of osteoarthritis it is still uncertain whether decreased synthesis or increased degradation leads to the reduction of HA. However, in the unloaded canine cartilage model, decreased synthesis appears to be responsible for the loss of matrix (21Palmoski M. Perricone E. Brandt K.D. Arthritis & Rheum. 1979; 22: 508-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 22Behrens F. Kraft E.L. Oegema Jr., T.R. J. Orthop. Res. 1989; 7: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In order to probe deeper into the regulatory mechanisms that might be involved in such systems, a better understanding of which enzyme(s) are responsible for HA synthesis in human articular cartilage is essential. However, no antibodies are as yet available to quantify HAS-1, HAS-2, or HAS-3; therefore, the use of indirect methods is required. In this study, quantitative (competitive) RT-PCR was used to determine, at a minimal level, which of these three enzymes is expressed as mRNA by human articular chondrocytes. However, even after determining which enzymes are expressed, and at what levels, it would still remain unclear which enzyme is functionally or primarily responsible for HA synthesis in cartilage. To address this question, sequence-specific phosphorothioate oligonucleotides directed against the predominant mRNA expressed (HAS-2) were used to determine the effects of inhibition of this enzyme. The present study demonstrates that HAS-2 inhibition results in a reduction in HA, a reduction in cell-associated matrix size, and a reduced capacity of the chondrocytes to retain proteoglycan.

Human articular cartilage was obtained from the talocrural ankle joint of normal human donors. Tissue was obtained within 24 h of death through the Regional Organ Bank of Illinois, and all donors were documented as having no known history of joint disease. Full thickness slices of articular cartilage were dissected under aseptic conditions and subjected to sequential Pronase and collagenase digestion to liberate chondrocytes from tissues (23Aydelotte M.B.

After 5 days of recovery, the chondrocytes were released from the alginate beads by treatment with 55 mm sodium citrate followed by a 20-min digestion with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA (25Chow G. Knudson C.B.

The cells were washed in DMEM containing 10% FBS to inactivate trypsin activity followed by a wash with serum-free DMEM. Cells were then resuspended in serum-free DMEM/F12 containing the presence or absence of various phosphorothioate oligonucleotides and replated into 35-mm dishes as monolayer cultures at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/dish. To provide for optimal transfection, the phosphorothioate oligonucleotides were first mixed with 6.0 μg/ml LipofectAMINE in serum-free DMEM and incubated for 20 min at room temperature to allow DNA-liposome complexes to form. The diluted complex solution (final oligonucleotide concentration of 2 μm) was mixed gently and added to the chondrocytes at the time of plating. Medium containing antisense or control oligonucleotides was then removed from the cultures after 5 h of incubation and replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS (i.e. oligonucleotide-free medium) and incubation continued for varying periods. Full thickness slices of human articular cartilage were dissected from the talocrural joint of normal human donor ankles (∼1 × 10 × 10 mm) and cultured directly in 2.0 ml of medium containing 10% FBS. Following 1 day of culture for recovery, the tissue slices were washed and medium was replaced with fresh serum-free DMEM in the presence or absence of various phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, diluted as LipofectAMINE DNA-liposomes to a final concentration of 2 μm. Medium (with or without oligonucleotides) was changed every 2 days. Following 7 days of incubation the slices were removed and embedded in HistoPrepTM freezing medium. Cryostat sections (8.0 μm) were prepared and stained for HA. HAS-2 antisense oligonucleotides were designed as 16-oligonucleotide sequences complementary to regions including the AUG start site of published human HAS-2 sequence (6Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22945-22948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) (5′-GCA TCT TGT TCA GCTC-3′). Control oligonucleotides included a sense and a reverse sequence oligonucleotide complementary to the same region (sense, 5′-GAG CTG AAC AAG ATGC-3′; reverse, 5′-CGT AGA ACA AGT CGAG-3′). Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue dye exclusion method. After 5 min of incubation with 0.4% trypan blue, the percentage of stained cells (indicative of nonviable cells) versus stain-excluding cells were counted in four random fields of the plate. Chondrocytes in culture wells or 8-μm cryostat sections of cartilage slices mounted onto glass slides were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde buffered with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature for 2 h. Tissue sections were pretreated with 2 units of chondroitinase ABC (at pH 8.0) for 2 h at 37 °C for unmasking. The tissue sections or cells were next treated with 0.3% H2O2 in 30% methanol for 30 min at room temperature to block the internal peroxidase activity and then incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Sections or cells were then incubated with 2.0 μg/ml biotinylated HA-binding protein (HABP) probe for 2 h at room temperature followed by a streptavidin-peroxidase reagent (Vectastain kit) and diaminobenzidine-containing substrate solution (SIGMA FASTTM DAB). As a control, tissue sections or chondrocytes were pretreated with 5 units/ml Streptomyces hyaluronidase for 1 h at 60 °C. Cell-associated pericellular matrices were visualized using a particle exclusion assay (15Knudson C.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Briefly, following treatment of monolayer cultures of chondrocytes with or without incubation with various phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, and 24 h of recovery in oligonucleotide-free medium, the culture medium was removed and replaced with a 0.75-ml suspension of formalin-fixed erythrocytes (108 per ml) in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The particles were allowed to settle for 15 min, and the cells were photographed using a Zeiss inverted phase-contrast microscope with Varel optics. After 24 h of treatment with antisense or sense oligonucleotides, monolayer cultures of chondrocytes were pulse-labeled with [35S]sulfate (20 μCi/ml) for 4 h. The cells were chased for an additional 24 h in fresh medium, at which time the culture medium pool and cell-associated matrix pool were separated and collected. The chase culture medium was removed and cell monolayer digested with 0.25% trypsin containing 1 mm EDTA, at 37 °C for 30 min. The trypsin/EDTA supernatant, defined as cell-associated matrix pool, was clarified by centrifugation. Proteoglycan (PG) aggregates within each pool were dissociated by adjustment to dissociative conditions, 4m guanidine HCl containing the following protease inhibitors at final concentrations as follows: 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 m 6-aminohexanoic acid, 5 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 24 h at 4 °C (25Chow G.

Shirota H. Thonar E.J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Total cytoplasmic RNA was extracted from chondrocyte monolayer cultures with Trizol reagents and subjected to reverse transcription and quantitative competitive PCR. Briefly, 0.25 μg of total RNA was converted to cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase in the presence of 0.15 μm HAS-2, HAS-3, or aggrecan-specific downstream primers (HAS-2, 5′-TTT CTT TAT GTG ACT CAT CTG TCT CAC CGG-3′; HAS-3, 5′-CAG AAG GCT GGA CAT ATA GAG GAG GG-3′; aggrecan, 5′-CTC CAC TGC CTG TGA AGT CAC CAC-3′). DNA fragments that share the same primer template sequence with the target cDNA but contain a completely different, smaller, or larger intervening sequence were prepared and used as DNA internal standards (i.e. mimics) (25Chow G.

Aliquots of sample cDNA mixed together with serial dilutions of DNA mimics were co-amplified as templates in the presence of downstream primers and 0.15 μm upstream primers for HAS-2, HAS-3, or aggrecan (HAS-2 upstream, 5′-ATT GTT GGC TAC CAG TTT ATC CAA ACG G-3′; HAS-3 upstream, 5′-AGA GAC CCC CAC TAA GTA CCT CCG-3′; aggrecan upstream, 5′-GCA CCA TGC CTT CTG CTT CCG AG-3′) in a PCR mixture consisting of 2 mm magnesium chloride, 200 μmof each deoxyribonucleotide, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase. The DNA was denatured by heating at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 23 cycles (28 cycles for HAS-3) of 1 min at 95 °C, annealing at 60 °C (64 °C for HAS-3), and extension at 72 °C for 1 min (Perkin-Elmer thermocycler). This reaction was followed by a final elongation step that lasted 5 min at 72 °C. The amplified products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels followed by staining with SYBR Green I. The stained products were scanned and quantified using a fluoroimaging system (Molecular Dynamics). To determine that all samples contained equivalent amounts of RNA (or to normalize results due to small differences), in a separate set of reactions total RNA from samples were co-amplified in the presence of serial dilutions of an RNA internal standard (mimic) prepared for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The GAPDH RNA mimic shares the same primer template sequence but contains a smaller intervening sequence. Samples containing 0.25 μg of sample total RNA were co-reverse-transcribed with 2-fold serial dilutions of GAPDH RNA mimic in the presence of 0.15 μm GAPDH-specific downstream primer (5′-TTA CTC CTT GGA GGC CAT GTG GGC C-3′). The sample and mimic cDNA products were then co-amplified in the presence of the GAPDH-specific downstream primer together with 0.15 μm upstream primer (5′-ACT GCC ACC CAG AAG ACT GTG GAT GG-3′) using PCR conditions as described for HAS-2 amplification. Only HAS-2 and HAS-3 products were detected following RT-PCR of normal human articular chondrocyte RNA. HAS-1 mRNA expression was not detected in these chondrocytes even with the use of high cycle numbers (i.e. 35 cycles), whereas the same primer pairs successfully generated HAS-1, HAS-2, and HAS-3 products from RNA derived from human dermal fibroblasts (CCD-1093Sk, data not shown). For quantification of HAS-2 and HAS-3 mRNA expression in human articular chondrocytes, quantitative competitive RT-PCR was performed. Ten-fold dilutions of DNA internal standards (termed “mimics”) were used to determine the concentration range necessary to compete for the PCR amplification of reverse-transcribed sample cDNAs (termed “targets”). Cycle number was also varied to determined the linear amplification range for both sample cDNA (target) and internal standard DNA (mimic). Shown in Fig. 1 is the co-amplification of target cDNA with 1.5- and 2-fold dilutions of mimic. As can be seen, a significantly different range of mimic concentrations was required to compete for the amplification of HAS-2 target cDNA as compared with HAS-3. The deduced copy number for HAS-2 expressed in normal human articular chondrocytes was approximately 40-fold higher than that of HAS-3 (TableI). Thus, as assessed by the level of mRNA expression, HAS-2 would appear to be the predominant enzyme expressed by human articular chondrocytes.Table ICopy number of HAS-2 and HAS-3 mRNA expressed by normal human articular chondrocytesEnzymeCopy numbercopies/μg RNAHAS-22.11 (±0.12) × 107HAS-35.52 (±0.63) × 105Data obtained in Fig. 1 were used to determine the copy number of HAS-2 and HAS-3 expressed by human articular chondrocytes.

Open table in a new tab Data obtained in Fig. 1 were used to determine the copy number of HAS-2 and HAS-3 expressed by human articular chondrocytes. Data represent the average ± S.D. of competitive RT-PCR results performed on three independent preparations of total RNA, isolated from chondrocytes derived from one representative donor. In order to determine whether HAS-2 enzyme is the principal functioning HA synthase, human articular chondrocytes as well as cartilage tissue slices were transfected with HAS-2 antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides. The level of inhibition of HAS-2 mRNA expression in chondrocyte cultures was determined by quantitative competitive RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2, treatment of chondrocytes with antisense oligonucleotides resulted in an ∼60% inhibition of HAS-2 mRNA expression (maximal inhibition obtained at 24-h time point), as compared with chondrocytes treated with the sense oligonucleotide (or compared with untreated chondrocytes, data not shown). However, at the 40-h time point (35 h of incubation in oligonucleotide-free medium), HAS-2 mRNA levels in antisense-treated cultures began to recover, approaching the levels present in sense-treated control cultures. To determine the specificity of antisense treatment on these chondrocytes, the effects on aggrecan mRNA expression was determined by quantitative competitive RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 3, no significant difference in the ratio of copy numbers of aggrecan was observed in antisense versussense oligonucleotide-treated chondrocytes. Given that aggrecan expression is highly sensitive to changes in chondrocyte metabolism, these data suggest that antisense treatment also had no significant effect on chondrocyte phenotype. Like the HAS results depicted in Fig. 2, the aggrecan results were normalized to GAPDH mRNA expression levels. However, when the ratio of GAPDH copy numbers are plotted (Fig. 3), it can be seen that there were no significant changes in the GAPDH levels in antisense- and sense-treated chondrocytes over the entire time course of the experiment. To support further the specificity of HAS-2 antisense inhibition, the effect of oligonucleotide treatment on cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion assay. As shown in Fig. 4, no change in chondrocyte viability was observed in cells transfected with control oligonucleotides (sense or reverse) or antisense oligonucleotides. Approximately 95% of all the chondrocytes under each condition was viable. Biotinylated HABP molecules were used to visualize HA within the cell-associated matrix of chondrocytes, as well as the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage slices. As shown in Fig. 5A, chondrocytes treated with control sense oligonucleotides display prominent staining for HA within the cell-associated matrix, depicted by a double-headed arrow. Untreated chondrocytes display a similar staining pattern (data not shown). Given that the entire cell-associate matrix was removed by trypsin/EDTA treatment at the time of plating (Fig. 5A, inset), the observed accumulation of HA must represent newly synthesized HA. Human articular chondrocytes treated with HAS-2 antisense oligonucleotides displayed a substantial inhibition of cell-associated HA (Fig. 5B). The expression of HA was not completely eliminated but was reduced to a level roughly comparable to the percent inhibition of HAS-2 mRNA (Fig. 2). Interestingly, however, although HAS-2 mRNA levels begin to return to control levels 40 h after antisense treatment (35 h of incubation in oligonucleotide-free medium), HA staining remains reduced at the 48-h time point (Fig. 5B, inset). As a control, sense oligonucleotide-treated chondrocytes (like those shown in Fig. 5A) were treated with Streptomyces hyaluronidase. As can be seen in Fig. 5C, all cell-associated staining for HA was removed. However, small patches of staining remains, protected from hyaluronidase treatment. We would suggest that this hyaluronidase-insensitive (protected) HABP-stainable material represents intracellular HA that are segregated into beaded structures, resembling endosomal vacuoles. The biotinylated HABP probe was also used to visualize HA within slices of human articular cartilage tissue. As shown in Fig. 5D, cartilage treated with control oligonucleotides displayed prominent staining for HA predominately associated with the pericellular, territorial, and near-interterritorial matrices. Seven days of treatment with HAS-2 antisense oligonucleotides resulted in a dramatic decrease in HABP-stainable HA, especially within matrix closely associated with the chondrocyte cell surface (Fig. 5E). As a control, cartilage samples identical to those in Fig. 5Dwere treated with Streptomyces hyaluronidase. As can be seen in Fig. 5F, hyaluronidase treatment resulted in a near complete removal of all HABP-stainable material. One of the functions of HA in chondrocytes is to serve as a scaffold for the assembly of a cell-associated matrix (15Knudson C.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 16Knudson W. Aguiar D.J. Hua Q. Knudson C.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In Fig. 6A and inset, 24-h control sense or reverse oligonucleotide-treated chondrocytes, respectively, display large cell-associated matrices (identical to untreated chondrocytes, not shown). However, HAS-2 antisense oligonucleotide treatment resulted in a substantial (but not total) decrease in the diameter of cell-associated matrix (Fig. 6B). Forty three hours after an initial 5-h pulse of HAS-2 antisense oligonucleotide (i.e. 48-h time point), the cell-associated matrix diameter began to increase (Fig. 6D) but was still smaller than control cells (Fig. 6C). However, by 72 h there was no difference between antisense and control oligonucleotide-treated cells (data not shown). A second important function of chondrocyte-derived HA is the retention of aggrecan. Trypsin/EDTA treatment of chondrocytes removes all cell surface-associated HA as well as the PG. When HAS-2 antisense or control oligonucleotide-treated chondrocytes were pulse-labeled with [35S]sulfate, no difference in the total amount of PG synthesized was detected (Fig. 7). This result adds support to the specificity of action of HAS-2 antisense treatment. That is, there are no apparent effects on aggrecan mRNA expression or the biosynthesis and secretion of aggrecan. However, the cellular distribution of newly synthesized aggrecan was altered. In HAS-2 antisense oligonucleotide-treated chondrocytes, less PG accumulated (or was retained) within the cell-associated matrix as compared with control oligonucleotide-treated cultures (Fig. 7). This reduction in cell-associated PG was contrasted by an increase in PG released into the culture medium. These results suggest that HAS-2 antisense oligonucleotide-treated chondrocytes have a reduced capacity to retain newly synthesized PG. The results from this study demonstrate that only HAS-2 and HAS-3 mRNAs are expressed by normal human articular chondrocytes. However, even though both messages are present, HAS-2 mRNA is expressed in large excess over that of HAS-3. The data shown in Table Irepresent the average of competitive RT-PCR results performed on three independent preparations of total RNA, isolated from chondrocytes derived from one representative donor. In experiments not shown, using chondrocytes from other donors, the absolute copy number of HAS-2 mRNA varied, slightly higher in some donors and lower in others. This heterogeneity in human donor cartilage samples is expected, and variations in enzymes such as HAS-2 may, in future studies, have diagnostic or prognostic importance. Nonetheless, in all of the normal donor-derived chondrocyte RNA examined, even though the absolute values of HAS-2 and HAS-3 mRNAs change, the ratio of HAS-2 to HAS-3 copy numbers remained relatively constant, from donor to donor. The HAS-2 antisense oligonucleotide treatment used in this study resulted in a substantial inhibition of HAS-2 expression at the 8- and 24-h time points. Our previous work using CD44 antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides on bovine chondrocytes required between 24 and 48 h of continuous treatment before a significant inhibition could be observed (29Chow G. Nietfeld J. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. Arthritis & Rheum. 1998; 41: 1411-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). One important difference between the two studies was the inclusion in this study, of the liposome-forming agent LipofectAMINE. LipofectAMINE is a 3:1 mixture of cationic and neutral lipids. Cationic lipid end groups bind the charged DNA molecules, and the complexes form into liposomes that subsequently interact with the cell membrane, leading to a highly efficient uptake of the bound DNA molecule into the cell (30Ben-Neriah Y. Daley G.Q. Mes-Masson A.M. Witt O.N. Baltimore D. Science. 1986; 233: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). In addition, LipofectAMINE transfection reportedly extends the half-life of oligonucleotides (31Leonetti J.P. Mechti N. Degols G. Gagnor C. Lebleu B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2702-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies using fluorescein-tagged phosphorothioate oligonucleotides plus LipofectAMINE demonstrated that a 5-h incubation period was sufficient to obtain saturable intracellular accumulation of oligonucleotide (data not shown). Without LipofectAMINE, the phosphorothioate oligonucleotides still enter the cells (chondrocytes) but require more than 24 h to reach the same level of intracellular accumulation. Thus, using LipofectAMINE, transfection times can be shorter, keeping to a minimum the time of culture with less-than-optimal medium and still provide for more than 24 h of selective gene inhibition. Such considerations in culturing are important in order to avoid changes in phenotype, especially when working with human articular chondrocytes. In this study the cells were grown initially in a three-dimensional alginate bead system under conditions maximized for the growth of human chondrocytes (32Hauselmann H.J. Fernandes R.J. Mok S.S. Schmid T.M. Block J.A. Aydelotte M.B. Kuettner K.E. Thonar E.J.-M.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 17-27PubMed Google Scholar). During the subsequent short term culture in monolayer, the cells continued to synthesize and secrete PG (Fig. 7) and continued to express aggrecan mRNA (Fig. 3). Neither aggrecan nor GAPDH mRNA levels changed significantly between the 8-, 24-, and 40-h time points. In addition, all of the chondrocytes depicted in Fig. 6 continue to maintain a rounded chondrocyte morphology together with an extensive cell-associated matrix, two key characteristics of the chondrocyte phenotype (33Aydelotte M.B. Schumacher B.L. Kuettner K.E. Kuettner K.E. Schleyerbach R. Peyron J.G. Hascall V.C. Articular Cartilage and Osteoarthritis. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992: 237-250Google Scholar). Antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of HAS-2 resulted in an inhibition in HA accumulation at the cell surface of chondrocytes as well as the pericellular matrix of cartilage tissue slices. These results confirm the expression data and suggest that HAS-2 is indeed the principal enzyme utilized by chondrocytes to synthesize HA. The level of inhibition of HAS-2 (∼60%) was similar to the level of inhibition that we obtained previously using CD44 antisense oligonucleotides in bovine articular chondrocytes (29Chow G. Nietfeld J. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. Arthritis & Rheum. 1998; 41: 1411-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). That the level of inhibition of HAS-2 achieved was not 100% was fortuitous. Given that 40% of HAS-2 mRNA was still detected in antisense-treated chondrocytes (and likely still functional), it is not surprising that a small amount of HABP staining for HA continued to be observed (Fig. 5B). The same cells also exhibited a thin particle exclusion zone of cell-associated matrix (Fig. 6B). The reduction in HA staining and the size of the cell-associated matrix appear roughly proportional to the degree of HAS-2 inhibition, again pointing to the suggestion that HAS-2 is the primary enzyme involved in chondrocyte HA production. However, additional studies such as the inclusion of HAS-3 antisense oligonucleotides will be needed to support more definitively the role of HAS-2 as the predominant HA synthase in chondrocytes. By assuming that the size of the HA synthesized in the presence of HAS-2 antisense oligonucleotides has not changed and that the concentration of aggrecan has not been altered (from Fig. 3 and Fig. 7), the results suggest that HA concentration alone controls the diameter of the cell-associated matrix. More experiments will be required to verify these observations. However, previous studies from our laboratories (14Knudson W. Knudson C.B. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 227-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Knudson C.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 34Knudson W. Bartnik E. Knudson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4003-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), based mainly on the particle exclusion assay, demonstrated that three components are necessary for the assembly of a cell-associated matrix by chondrocytes, namely HA, an aggregating PG, and a cell-surface HA receptor such as CD44. Deficiency in any one of these three components is sufficient to inhibit matrix assembly in chondrocytes (and many other cell types). Although not shown in this study, CD44 expression was not affected by HAS-2 antisense treatment, and as discussed above, aggrecan was also not affected. Therefore, it is likely that the inhibition of HA is responsible for the altered size of the cell-associated matrix. The maintenance of healthy cartilage requires a capacity for the turnover and repair of the extracellular matrix. A critical factor in this process is the retention of newly synthesized matrix, especially the water-soluble components of matrix such as aggrecan. The retention of aggrecan in turn, is highly dependent on its interaction with HA, including both the formation of link protein-stabilized HA-PG aggregates within the extracellular matrix and HA-CD44 interactions that serve to anchor the PG-rich matrix to the chondrocyte cell surface. Both of these retention mechanisms are likely altered when HAS-2 expression is inhibited. Thus, understanding the regulation of chondrocyte HAS enzymes may be critical to attempts at promoting cartilage tissue repair. Whether a condition analogous to this experimentally induced inhibition of HAS-2 occurs in human tissues such as during aging or disease remains to be determined. Certainly, the depletion of HA and subsequent passive loss of proteoglycan observed in joint immobilization studies (20Haapala J. Lammi M.J. Inkinen R. Parkkinen J.J. Agren U.M. Arokoski J. Kiviranta I. Helminen H.J. Tammi M.I. J. Rheumatol. 1996; 22: 1586-1593Google Scholar) suggests that HA synthesis is at least dynamic and sensitive to changes in loading (or lack thereof). What factors other than loading regulate HAS expression in chondrocytes and could the control of these factors be used for beneficial changes in damaged cartilage tissue? Are changes in HAS usage by chondrocytes (i.e. usage of HAS-1 or HAS-3 instead of HAS-2) evoked by certain physiological conditions? All of these questions remain to be answered, especially now that the enzymes responsible are becoming characterized. The results from this study demonstrate the importance of these enzymes in maintaining the HA-PG-rich cartilage extracellular matrix.

The MAP kinase signaling pathways consist of three major phosphorylation cascades as follows: the extracellular signaling-regulated protein kinases, the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK), and the p38 MAP kinases (12Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar, 13Hunter T.

JNK and p38 pathways are collectively termed stress-activated protein kinases because they are activated by various stress-related stimuli (14Force T. Pombo C.M. Avruch J.A. Bonventre J.V.

Science. 1998; 280: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) reported that ROS were essential for nuclear factor (NF)-κB-dependent transcriptional regulation of collagenase-1 gene expression induced by cell shape change. Ultimately, mechanotransduction events lead to increased cell size and cardiac remodeling. Several extracellular matrix molecules, including tenascin-C and fibronectin, are induced in remodeling tissues. Tenascin-C is a disulfide-linked hexameric extracellular matrix protein with subunit molecular masses of 190–300 kDa depending on the species and on alternative splicing within fibronectin type III repeats (22Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Experientia (Basel). 1995; 51: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Tenascin-C is able to interact with cell surface receptors including integrins (23Zisch A.H. D'Alessandri L.

Bernasconi C. Chiquet M. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Tenascin-C inhibits the attachment of fibroblasts and endothelial cells to various adhesive proteins (27Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 800-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, tenascin-C may be important in regulating cell-extracellular matrix interactions by promoting cell rounding, migration, and/or differentiation. By using a mechanical deformation device that applies a highly uniform biaxial strain field over the culture substrate, we investigated the effects of mechanical strain on tenascin-C gene expression in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. We found that tenascin-C is mechanically induced in cardiac myocytes through the activation of NF-κB, suggesting that tenascin-C can be an angiotensin II-independent early marker for cardiac remodeling. In addition, our data suggest that ROS may participate in mechanically induced cardiomyocyte responses. Staurosporine, calphostin C, genistein, PD98059, and SB203580 were purchased from Calbiochem. Recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) was purchased from Becton Dickinson (Bedford, MA). CP191,166 (Ki = 3.1 nm, AT1/AT2 IC50 = 3.5 nm, 4.0 μm), an AT1 antagonist, was from Pfizer, Inc. (Groton, CT). Fibronectin was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Cycloheximide, actinomycin D,N-acetyl-l-cysteine, catalase, and 1,2-dihydroxy-benzene-3,5-disulfonate (Tiron), 7-nitroindazole, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were purchased from Sigma. [γ-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]dUTP (800 Ci/mmol), and [3H]chloramphenicol (40 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. NRVM from 1-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were isolated by previously described methods (28Springhorn J.P. Claycomb W.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The ventricles were excised, cut into several pieces, and incubated overnight at 4 °C in 1 mg/ml 1:300 trypsin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS, Life Technologies, Inc.). The ventricular tissue was then digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase type II (239 units/mg; Worthington) in HBSS, centrifuged twice at 50 × g to remove less dense cells such as fibroblasts, and then plated. The cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) containing 7% bovine fetal calf serum (FCS, Life Technologies, Inc.), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Mechanical deformation was applied to a thin and transparent membrane on which cells were cultured, an approach that produces controlled cellular strain as well as visualization of cells. The device used in this study provides a nearly homogeneous and uniform biaxial strain profile, i.e. strains that are equal at all locations on the membrane and in all directions. This approach eliminates locations on the substrate that have very high strains (20–30%) in one direction. We have previously measured membrane strains with a high resolution video device (29Cheng G.C. Briggs W.H. Gerson D.S. Libby P. Grodzinsky A.J. Gray M.L. Lee R.T. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); the cams used for this study gave strains of 1, 4, 9, and 14%. We have observed that strains larger than 14% lead to cell injury (data not shown), and the design of this device is limited to a maximum strain of 14%. NRVM were plated on a fibronectin-coated (2 μg/ml) membrane dish at a density of 2,000,000 cells/dish in 13 ml of DMEM containing 7% FCS and incubated 24 h. Approximate cell confluence was 85–90%. NRVM were then made quiescent by washing with 10 ml of HBSS twice and incubating with 10 ml of DMEM containing 1% insulin, transferrin, selenium media supplement (Sigma), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. All experiments were performed with NRVM that had been serum-starved for 24 h. We routinely obtained primary cultures with >95% myocytes, as assessed by microscopic observation of spontaneous contraction and by immunofluorescence staining with a monoclonal human ventricular myosin heavy chain antibody (Biogenesis, Poole, UK). 90–95% of these cells also stained positive by a monoclonal human tenascin-C antibody (Locus Genex Oy, Helsinki, Finland). Total RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate and phenol chloroform method (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62896) Google Scholar). Purified RNA (1 μg) was used for the synthesis of cDNA with a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Synthesis of the cDNAs was performed by polymerase chain reaction with Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). The primer set for the synthesis of the 450-base pair tenascin-C cDNA probe contained the 5′-TCT-GTC-CTG-GAC-TGC-TGA-TG-3′ sense and 5′-TCT-TCA-AAT-CCC-TTC-ATG-GC-3′ antisense oligonucleotides. The primer set for the synthesis of the 585-base pair secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) cDNA probe contained the 5′-AAA-CAT-GGC-AAG-GTG-TGT-GA-3′ sense and 5′-GGT-CTC-AAA-GAA-GCG-AGT-GG-3′ antisense oligonucleotides. The primer set for the synthesis of the 546-base pair fibronectin cDNA probe contained the 5′-GGG-AGA-AGT-TTG-TGC-ATG-GT-3′ sense and 5′-CCT-CGC-TCA-GTT-CGT-ACT-CC-3′ antisense oligonucleotides. Rat BNP cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. David G. Gardner, University of California, San Francisco. These cDNA were radiolabeled by the random priming method with [α-32P]dCTP and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (Stratagene). For Northern blotting, 15 μg of total RNA was loaded on a 1.0% formaldehyde gel (2.0m), transferred to a nylon membrane (Stratagene), and UV cross-linked with a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene). The probe was hybridized with QuikHyb solution (Stratagene) at 68 °C for 1 h. The membrane was exposed to x-ray film overnight at −80 °C with one intensifying screen. Normalization of RNA for equal loading was carried out by hybridizing the blots with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA probe (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Levels of tenascin-C and GAPDH mRNA were quantitated by densitometry of the Northern blot autoradiographs using Optimas 5.0 densitometry software (Optimas, Bothell, WA). RNase protection assay was performed using the RPA II kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). A 409-base pair rat tenascin-C cDNA for RNase protection assay was used as probe. Synthesis of the tenascin-C cDNA was performed by polymerase chain reaction with Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). The primer set for the synthesis of the tenascin cDNA probe contained the 5′-GCA-TCC-GTA-CCA-AAA-CCA-TC-3′ sense and 5′-CGG-AAA-TTC-TCC-ACT-TGA-GC-3′ antisense oligonucleotides. The tenascin-C cDNA was subcloned into the pCR®II vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and the sequence of tenascin-C cDNA was confirmed. The vector was linealized with HindIII restriction endonuclease, and a 32P-labeled antisense riboprobe was made using T7 RNA polymerase. A 32P-labeled riboprobe for 18 S was also transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase. Twenty-microgram samples were then hybridized with both probes (tenascin-C, 300,000 cpm/sample; 18 S, 20,000 cpm/sample) overnight at 45 °C, followed by RNase A/RNase T1 digestion. The protected fragments were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel. The gel was exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C overnight. The amount of RNA was internally standardized using 18 S mRNA levels. Conditioned media were concentrated by Centricon-10 miniconcentrators (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). Total protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and equal quantities of total protein were loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in 25 mm Tris base (pH 8.5), 0.2 mglycine, and 20% methanol. The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked by 5% nonfat dried milk in TBS washing buffer containing 20 mm Tris base (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h. For the detection of tenascin-C, the membrane was incubated with 1:1000 diluted human monoclonal anti-tenascin-C antibody (Locus Genex Oy) for 1 h at 37 °C and washed with TBS washing buffer for 30 min. After application of goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to peroxidase (Bio-Rad), the membrane was developed with the enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The human tenascin-C promoter constructs containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter were kindly provided by Dr. Bernard Binétruy, Institut de Recherche sur le Cancer, France (31Mettouchi A.

Cardiac myocytes were transfected with each reporter plasmid (10 μg) using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (32Yamamoto K. Ikeda U. Seino Y. Tsuruya Y. Oguchi A. Okada K. Ishikawa S.

As an internal control for transfection efficiency, CMV.β-gal plasmid (3 μg) was cotransfected in all experiments; β-galactosidase staining indicated that cellular transfection efficiency was 10%. Cells were subjected to mechanical strain 48 h after transfection, and lysates were prepared 24 h later for CAT and β-galactosidase assays (Promega, Madison, WI). CAT assays were performed as described by the manufacturer (Promega). The relative CAT activity was calculated as the ratio of CAT to β-galactosidase activity and standardized to unstimulated −220-CAT promoter activity (fold induction). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (35Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar), and the protein concentration of each extract was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Oligonucleotide probes for the NF-κB consensus sequences (Promega) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP by incubating with T4 polynucleotide kinase at 37 °C for 10 min. The labeled probe was separated from unincorporated nucleotide using a Sephadex G-50 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ten μg of nuclear extract was incubated in 10 μl of binding buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 20% glycerol for 10 min at room temperature. 32P-Labeled oligonucleotide probe (50,000–200,000 cpm) was then added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were resolved with 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 12 V/cm in 0.5× TBE. Specificity was determined by the addition of p50 antibody (15 μg IgG/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or excess unlabeled (cold) NF-κB oligonucleotide (1.75 pm) to the nuclear extracts for 10 min before addition of radiolabeled probe. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. A paired two-tailed Student's t test was used to analyze differences between two groups, and p values of < 0.05 were considered significant. We first investigated whether mechanical strain modulated gene expression of tenascin-C as well as SPARC, a remodeling related matrix protein, and fibronectin in NRVM. As shown in Fig. 1, 9% cyclic mechanical strain at 1 Hz induced tenascin-C mRNA accumulation with a maximum peak at 6 h (3.9 ± 0.5-fold by densitometry, p < 0.01,n = 13), whereas mechanical strain did not induce SPARC nor fibronectin mRNA. In addition, when cyclic biaxial strains of 1, 4, 9, and 14% at 1 Hz for 6 h were imposed, induction of tenascin-C mRNA expression in NRVM was amplitude-dependent (Fig. 2). In these studies, no morphologic changes in cardiac myocytes were detected following strains of 1–14%.Figure 2The dependence of tenascin-C mRNA expression in NRVM on the amplitude of mechanical strain. NRVM were plated on 2 μg/ml fibronectin in DMEM containing 7% FCS for 24 h. After serum deprivation for 24 h, myocytes were exposed for 6 h to 0, 1, 4, 9, and 14% cyclic mechanical strain (1 Hz). Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blotting with32P-labeled tenascin-C (upper panel) and GAPDH (lower panel) cDNA probes. Data are representative of two experiments that gave nearly identical results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LaFleur et al. (36LaFleur D.W. Fagin J.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20757-20763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that there are alternatively spliced isoforms of rat tenascin-C, and our Northern analysis suggested that at least two of these species are induced by deformation of cardiac myocytes. We then performed an RNase protection assay with a probe designed to distinguish the three rat tenascin-C cDNA species. We observed three bands of 107, 375, and 409 base pairs in size, corresponding to the three alternatively spliced messages (36LaFleur D.W. Fagin J.A. Forrester J.S. Rubin S.A. Sharifi B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20757-20763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 9% mechanical strain and PDGF-BB (1 ng/ml) induced all three alternatively spliced isoforms of tenascin-C (Fig. 3). To determine whether mechanical strain increased tenascin-C mRNA accumulation by increasing the rate of synthesis or by decreasing the rate of degradation, NRVM were incubated in the presence or absence of 9% strain for 6 h and then incubated further with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) to inhibit transcriptional activity. The half-life (t½ <3 h) of tenascin-C mRNA was not affected by mechanical strain (Fig. 4). This experiment suggested that mechanical strain increases the rate of synthesis of tenascin C mRNA. We next investigated whether the increase in tenascin-C mRNA by mechanical strain was accompanied by an increase in tenascin-C protein. The expression of tenascin-C protein was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-tenascin-C antibody. The tenascin-C protein bands at 220 and 250 kDa were increased in an amplitude-dependent manner (Fig. 5). Mechanical strain may induce proteins including growth factors and vasoconstrictors in cardiac myocytes. We studied whether new protein synthesis was required for the induction of tenascin-C mRNA expression by strain. The addition of cycloheximide (10 μm; 0% inhibition), a protein synthesis inhibitor, did not affect the induction of tenascin-C mRNA by strain in NRVM (Fig. 6A). This indicates that cyclic mechanical strain induces tenascin-C mRNA expression in NRVM without new protein synthesis. In addition, we investigated whether the effect of cyclic mechanical strain on tenascin-C mRNA expression in NRVM is angiotensin II-dependent. NRVM were subjected to 9% cyclic strain at 1 Hz for 6 h in the presence or absence of an AT1 antagonist. As shown in Fig. 6B, CP191,166 (0.1 μm), an AT1 antagonist, inhibited the induction of BNP mRNA (52% inhibition) but not tenascin-C mRNA (0% inhibition) by cyclic mechanical strain. Therefore, in contrast to the previously reported effect of angiotensin II on strain-mediated BNP induction (37Liang F. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14612-14619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that angiotensin II is involved in the effect of cyclic mechanical strain on tenascin-C mRNA expression in NRVM. Mechanical strain activates protein kinase C, tyrosine kinases, and MAP kinases in cardiac myocytes (7Komuro I. Katoh Y. Kaida T. Shibazaki Y. Kurabayashi M. Takaku F. Yazaki Y. J. Biol.

We examined the role of three pathways on the induction of tenascin-C mRNA expression by mechanical strain. Staurosporine (100 nm; 12% inhibition), a non-selective protein kinase inhibitor, minimally inhibited tenascin-C mRNA induction by strain, but neither calphostin C (1 μm; 5% inhibition), a selective protein kinase C inhibitor, nor genistein (100 μm; 8% inhibition), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, inhibited the induction by strain (Fig. 7A). In addition, neither PD98059 (50 μm; 0% inhibition), a MAP kinase kinase inhibitor, nor SB203580 (10 μm; 5% inhibition), a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, inhibited the effect of mechanical strain (Fig. 7B). These findings suggest that the effect of cyclic mechanical strain is protein kinase C-independent and MAP kinase-independent. ROS may participate in mechanotransduction; therefore, we investigated the effects of antioxidants on the induction of tenascin-C mRNA by strain. Antioxidants, such as N-acetyl-l-cysteine (10 mm; 90% inhibition), catalase (500 units/ml; 93% inhibition), and Tiron (10 mm; 95% inhibition) inhibited the effect of strain, whereas inhibition of reactive nitrogen species by 7-nitroindazole (100 μm; 3% inhibition) had no effect (Fig. 8). Furthermore, the addition of H2O2 (100 μm) induced tenascin-C mRNA in the absence of strain. To identify possible sites of induction of the tenascin-C promoter by mechanical strain, we performed transfection studi"

We have purified from mung bean seedlings the GDP-l-Fuc:Asn-linked GlcNAc α1,3-fucosyltransferase (core α1,3-fucosyltransferase) that is responsible for the synthesis of this linkage. The major isoform had an apparent mass of 54 kDa and isoelectric points ranging from 6.8 to 8.2. From that protein, four tryptic peptides were isolated and sequenced.

Analysis of cDNA derived from genomic DNA revealed the presence of three introns within the open reading frame. Remarkably, from the four exons, only exon II exhibited significant homology to animal and bacterial α1,3/4-fucosyltransferases which, though, are responsible for the biosynthesis of Lewis determinants.

According to their biosynthesis, these structures are classified as complex-type N-glycans, even though the terms paucimannosidic or truncated N-glycans appear to be more justified.

Since both xylose and core α1,3-fucose are not seen in mammalian glycoproteins they may form the key component of epitopes for carbohydrate-reactive antibodies (9Faye L. Gomord V. Fitchette-Lainé A.C. Chrispeels M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 10Garcia-Casado G. Sanchez-Monge R. Chrispeels M.J. Armentia A. Salcedo G. Gomez L.

There is, however, evidence that the α1,3-linked fucosyl residue is the predominant antibody binding structural element (3Kurosaka A. Yano A. Itoh N. Kuroda Y. Nakagawa T. Kawasaki T. J. Biol.

Allergy Immunol. 1993; 102: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Due to the ubiquitous occurrence of such paucimannosidic N-glycans throughout the plant kingdom, they are responsible for the frequently observed cross-reactivity of antibodies raised against plant glycoproteins and are therefore termed “cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants” (12Faye L. Chrispeels M.J. Glycoconjugate J. 1988; 5: 245-256Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 14Aalberse R.C. van Ree R. Clin. Rev.

Anti-cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants antibodies of the IgE class have been found in sera of many allergic patients (8Wilson I.B.H. Harthill J.E. Mullin N. Ashford D. Altmann F.

While the clinical role of cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants remains controversial, they are suspected to obscure (at least in vitro) allergy diagnosis. Anti-cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants antibodies will also react with many insect glycoproteins such as honeybee venom phospholipase A2 or neuronal membrane glycoproteins from insect embryos because insects, like plants, are capable of synthesizing the core α1,3-fucose epitope (3Kurosaka A.

In contrast to the blood group-related fucosyltransferases which act on the nonreducing terminus of N-glycans, O-glycans, or glycolipids (20Staudacher E. Trends Glycosci.

As regards core α1,3-fucosyltransferase (Fuc-T C3), a first characterization of the enzyme from mung bean seedlings revealed its dependence on the presence of nonreducing terminal GlcNAc (23Staudacher E. Dalik T. Wawra P. Altmann F. März L. Glycoconjugate J. 1995; 12: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the purification to homogeneity of Fuc-T C3 from mung bean seedlings, the cloning of its cDNA by a PCR-based approach, and the expression of active recombinant Fuc-T C3 in baculovirus infected insect cells. Mung bean seedlings (germinated for 3 days in the dark) were kindly donated by Dr. Zun-Ho Wu (Vienna, Austria) and by Evergreen Co. (Oeynhausen, Austria). Activated CH-Sepharose 4B, S-Sepharose, and GDP-l-[U-14C]fucose were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. “GnGn-Sepharose” (see Fig. 1 for glycan structures) was prepared by coupling of GnGn-peptide (see below) to activated CH-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions. GDP-l-fucose, bovine kidneyN-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase, N-acetyllactosamine (Galβ1–4GlcNAc), lacto-N-biose (Galβ1–3GlcNAc), lacto-N-tetraose (Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc), IEF standard mixture, and IPL-41 medium were purchased from Sigma. GDP-hexanolamine-agarose was purchased from Calbiochem. Sequencing grade trypsin, N-glycosidase A, N-glycosidase F, alkaline phosphatase, PstI, and BamHI were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, Dowex 1-X8, and Dowex 50W-X2 (H+-form) were purchased from Fluka. β-Galactosidase from Aspergillus oryzae was prepared as described (24Zeleny R. Altmann F. Praznik W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 246: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Biantennary asialo- and agalacto-glycopeptide (GnGn-peptide; see Fig. 1) were prepared from bovine fibrin by Pronase digestion, chemical desialylation, and enzymatic degalactosylation as described (23Staudacher E. Dalik T. Wawra P. Altmann F. März L. Glycoconjugate J. 1995; 12: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The core 6-fucosylated GnGnF6-peptide was similarly derived from human IgG (25Staudacher E. März L. Glycoconjugate J. 1998; 15: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). MM-peptide was prepared by treatment of GnGn-peptide with N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase (25Staudacher E. März L. Glycoconjugate J. 1998; 15: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 26Kubelka V. Altmann F. Staudacher E. Tretter V. März L. Hård K. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Dabsylated GnGn-hexapeptide was derived by β-galactosidase degradation of dabsylated GalGal-hexapeptide which was available from a previous study (27Altmann F. Schweiszer S. Weber C. Glycoconjugate J. 1995; 12: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Man5GlcNAc2-Asn (M5-Asn) was obtained by pronase digestion of α-amylase (27Altmann F. Schweiszer S. Weber C. Glycoconjugate J. 1995; 12: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). From this substrate, M5Gn-Asn (see Fig. 1 for structure) was prepared using recombinant GlcNAc transferase I from tobacco which was kindly provided by Dr. Herta Steinkellner (28Strasser R. Mucha J. Schwihla H. Altmann F. Glössl J. Steinkellner H. Glycobiology. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The structure and purity of these acceptors was checked by MALDI-TOF MS (see below). SV Total RNA Isolation System, avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, and Taq Polymerase were purchased from Promega. Lipofectin, fetal calf serum, 3′-5′ RACE System (version 2.0) for rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and degenerate oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., whereas Fuc-T C3 specific primers were synthesized by Vienna Biocenter Genomics. The TA Cloning Kit was obtained from Invitrogen. Enzymatic activity of Fuc-T C3 was determined using GnGn-peptide and GDP-l-[U-14C]fucose at substrate concentrations of 0.5 and 0.25 mm, respectively, in the presence of Mes-HCl buffer, Triton X-100, MnCl2, GlcNAc, and AMP as described (25Staudacher E. März L. Glycoconjugate J. 1998; 15: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Staudacher E. Altmann F. Glössl J. März L. Schachter H. Kamerling J.P. Hård K. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Where specified, other acceptors were used. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. Mung bean seedlings were homogenized with a kitchen blender using 0.75 volumes of extraction buffer per kg of beans. The extraction buffer consisted of 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.25 m sucrose, and 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3. The resulting homogenate was filtered through two layers of cloth and the filtrate was centrifuged at 30,000 ×g for 40 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was extracted with solubilization buffer consisting of 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5% Triton X-100, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, by stirring overnight. Subsequent centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 40 min yielded the Triton X-100 extract which was further purified as follows. Step 1: the Triton X-100 extract was applied to a column (5 × 28 cm) of DE52 cellulose (Whatman) previously equilibrated with buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.02% NaN3). The non-binding fraction was directly used for step 2. Step 2: the sample was applied to a column (2.5 × 32 cm) of Affi-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer A. After washing the column with this buffer, adsorbed protein was eluted with buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl. Step 3: following dialysis of the eluate from step 2 against buffer B (25 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.3, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.02% NaN3) it was loaded onto a column (1.5 × 18 cm) of S-Sepharose equilibrated with the same buffer. Bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5m NaCl in buffer B. Fractions containing Fuc-T C3 were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C (25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3, containing 5 mm MnCl2 and 0.02% NaN3). Step 4: the dialyzed sample was applied to a column (0.5 × 4.5 cm) of GnGn-Sepharose previously equilibrated with buffer C. Elution of the bound protein was accomplished with buffer C containing 1m NaCl instead of MnCl2. Step 5: the enzyme was then dialyzed against buffer D (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, containing 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.02% NaN3) and subsequently loaded onto a column (0.5 × 4.5 cm) of GDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose. After washing the column with buffer D, Fuc-T C3 was eluted by substituting MgCl2 and NaCl with 0.5 mm GDP. Active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer of pH 7.3, and lyophilized. SDS-PAGE was performed in a Bio-Rad Mini Protean Cell on gels containing 12.5% acrylamide and 1% bisacrylamide. Gels were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or silver. Isoelectric focusing of Fuc-T C3 was carried out on precast gels with a pI range from 6 to 9 (Servalyt precotes 6–9, Serva) and gels were silver stained according to the manufacturers instructions. For two-dimensional electrophoresis, lanes from the focusing gel were excised, treated with S-alkylation reagents and SDS, and subject to SDS-PAGE as described previously (30Görg A. Postel W. Günther S. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Protein bands were excised from Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels, carboxyamidomethylated, and digested with sequencing grade trypsin according to the in-gel digestion procedure described previously (31Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mortensen P. Shevchenko A. Boucherie H. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). The tryptic peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC on a 1.0 × 250-mm Vydac C18 at 40 °C with a flow rate of 0.05 ml/min using a HP 1100 apparatus (Hewlett-Packard). Isolated peptides were sequenced with a Hewlett-Packard G1005A protein sequencing system according to the manufacturer's protocol. In addition, the peptide mixture obtained by in-gel digestion was analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (see below). Total RNA was isolated from 3-day-old mung bean hypocotyls using the SV Total RNA Isolation System from Promega according to the supplier's instructions. To achieve first strand cDNA synthesis, total RNA was incubated for 1 h at 48 °C with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primer using the Reverse Transcription System (Promega). First strand cDNA was subjected to PCR using as the sense primer 5′-GCIGARTAYTAYGCIGARAAYAAYATHGC-3′ (S1) and as the antisense primer 5′-CRTADATRTGRTAIACIGTYTC-3′ (S2) or 5′-TADATISWYTCCATYTCRAA-3′ (S3), where I stands for inosin; R for G + A; Y for T + C; H for T + C + A; D for T + G + A; S for G + C; and W for A + T. PCR was performed on 10 μl of the reverse transcriptase reaction in a volume of 50 μl containing 0.1 μmol of each primer, 0.1 mmdNTPs, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer of pH 9.0, 50 mm KCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. After an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 49 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C were run. The final extension step at 72 °C was carried out for 8 min. PCR products were subcloned into pCR2.1 vector using the TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced. On the basis of the sequence of PCR product(s), the missing 5′ and 3′ regions of the cDNA coding for Fuc-T C3 were obtained by 5′- and- 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using the RACE kit from Life Technologies, Inc. according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 3′-RACE was performed with hemi-nested PCR using as antisense primer the universal amplification primer supplied with the kit and as sense primers at first 5′-CTGGAACTGTCCCTGTGGTT-3′ and then 5′-AGTGCACTAGAGGGCCAGAA-3′. Likewise, 5′-RACE was performed by means of hemi-nested PCR using as the sense primer the abridged anchor primer supplied with the kit and as antisense primers either 5′-GAATGCAAAGACGGCACGATGAAT-3′ and then 5′-TTCGAGCACCACAATTGGAAAT-3′ or PCR was performed with an annealing temperature of 55 °C under conditions otherwise as described above. Both 5′- and 3′-RACE products were subcloned into pCR2.1 vector and sequenced. Genomic DNA was prepared out of lyophilized mung bean hypocotyls by means of the DNeasy Plant Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed on 200 ng of DNA in 50 μl of solution containing 20 nmol each of fucosyltransferase-specific primers (see below) essentially as described above except that the annealing temperature was raised to 58 °C. The three resulting PCR products (FSP34–59, FSP37–515, and FSP 32–511) were subcloned into pCR2.1 vector using the TA cloning Kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Forward primers 5′-GGAACCATCCACCCATAAC-3′, 5′-AGTCGTGTTCGGTTGGATGT-3′, and 5′-CTGGAACTGTCCCTGTGGTT-3′ and reverse primers 5′-CTCAGCATAGTATTCTGCTG-3′, 5′- GAAGGAGCAAAGTCCTGAATA-3′, and 5′-GTACCATTTAGCGCAT-3′ were used to cover cDNA regions from −174 to 522, 392 to 944, and 890 to 1550 bp, respectively. Sequences of subcloned fragments were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using an ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready reaction Kit and an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic analyzer (Perkin-Elmer). T7 and M13 forward primers were used for sequencing the PCR products cloned in pCR2.1. Sequencing of both strands of the complete coding region was performed by the Vienna VBC Genomics-Sequencing Service using the cycle sequencing method with infrared labeled primers (IRD700 and IRD800) and a LI-COR Long Read IR 4200 sequencer (Lincoln, NE). The coding region of the putative Fuc-T C3 cDNA including the cytoplasmic and the transmembrane regions was amplified using the forward primer 5′-cggcggatcCGCAATTGAATGATG-3′ and the reversal primer 5′-ccggctgcaGTACCATTTAGCGCAT-3′ by means of the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The PCR product was double digested with PstI and BamHI and subcloned into alkaline phosphatase-treated baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 previously double digested with PstI and BamHI. To allow homologous recombination, the transfer vector was co-transfected with BaculoGold viral DNA (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) into Sf9 insect cells in IPL-41 medium containing Lipofectin. After 5 days of incubation at 27 °C, various volumes of supernatant containing recombinant virus were used for infection of Sf21 insect cells. After incubation for 4 days at 27 °C in IPL-41 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, the Sf21 cells were harvested and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer of pH 7.4 containing 2% Triton X-100 and disrupted by sonication on ice. This homogenate as well as the culture supernatant were assayed for Fuc-T C3 activity. Mock infections were performed with recombinant baculovirus encoding tobacco GlcNAc transferase I (28Strasser R. Mucha J. Schwihla H. Altmann F. Glössl J. Steinkellner H. Glycobiology. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Dabsylated GnGn-hexapeptide (2 nmol) was incubated with insect cell homogenate containing recombinant Fuc-T C3 (0.08 milliunit) in the presence of non-radioactive GDP-l-fucose (10 nmol) under conditions otherwise identical to those described for determination of transferase activity (see above). A control experiment was performed with homogenate from mock-infected insect cells. After incubation for 16 h at 37 °C, aliquots of 0.5 μl were diluted 20-fold and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. In addition, aliquots of both samples were mixed to give similar concentrations of substrate and product. This mixture was diluted with 0.1 m ammonium acetate of pH 4.0 containing 10 microunits of N-glycosidase A or with 50 mm Tris/HCl of pH 8.5 containing 100 microunits (1 unit hydrolyzing 1 μmol of substrate/min) of N-glycosidase F, respectively. After 2 and 20 h, small aliquots of these mixtures were removed and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The remaining half of the sample containing the Fuc-T C3 product was digested withN-glycosidase A. The resulting oligosaccharides were pyridylaminated and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC (8Wilson I.B.H. Harthill J.E. Mullin N. Ashford D. Altmann F. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 32Kubelka V. Altmann F. März L. Arch. Biochem.

The transferase product was degraded usingN-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase and again analyzed by HPLC. Pyridylaminated GnGnF6 derived from human IgG, MMF3 from honeybee venom phospholipase A2, GnGn, GnM, MGn, and MM from bovine fibrin were used as reference substances (23Staudacher E. Dalik T. Wawra P. Altmann F. März L. Glycoconjugate J. 1995; 12: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 26Kubelka V. Altmann F. Staudacher E. Tretter V. März L. Hård K. Kamerling J.P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17344-17349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Additionally, the mass of the pyridylaminated product was determined by MALDI-TOF MS (see below). Mass spectrometry was performed on a DYNAMO (Thermo BioAnalysis, Santa Fe, NM), a linear MALDI-TOF MS capable of dynamic extraction (a synonym for delayed extraction). Two types of sample-matrix preparations were employed. Peptides and dabsylated glycopeptides were dissolved in 5% formic acid and aliquots were spotted on the target, air dried, and overlaid with 1% α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. Pyridylaminated glycans, reducing oligosaccharides, and underivatized glycopeptides were properly diluted with water, spotted on the target, and air dried. After addition of 2% 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, the samples were immediately dried by application of vacuum. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) or, at the final steps of enzyme purification, by amino acid analysis (35Altmann F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Fuc-T C3 was purified from mung bean seedlings by Triton X-100 extraction of a crude microsomal preparation and several chromatographic steps including cation exchange and two types of affinity chromatography. The typical elution profile of activity from the S-Sepharose is shown in Fig. 2. Conveniently, this step provided separation from N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase which otherwise would have degraded the ligand of the subsequent affinity chromatography on GnGn-Sepharose (Fig. 2). After the last purification step on GDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose, the final yield was 18 μg of protein from 5 kg of mung beans (TableI). SDS-PAGE revealed two bands, a major band at 54 kDa and one at 56 kDa (Fig. 3). In order to check whether the two polypeptides are distinct or just different forms of the same enzyme, the bands were compared by MALDI-TOF MS of tryptic peptides obtained by in-gel digestion. The mass spectra of the 54- and 56-kDa band were indistinguishable indicating that both b"
https://openalex.org/W2003599613,"In sterol-depleted mammalian cells, a two-step proteolytic process releases the NH2-terminal domains of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) from membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These domains translocate into the nucleus, where they activate genes of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. The SREBPs are oriented in the membrane in a hairpin fashion, with the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains facing the cytosol and a single hydrophilic loop projecting into the lumen. The first cleavage occurs at Site-1 within the ER lumen to generate an intermediate that is subsequently released from the membrane by cleavage at Site-2, which lies within the first transmembrane domain. A membrane protein, designated S2P, a putative zinc metalloprotease, is required for this cleavage. Here, we use protease protection and glycosylation site mapping to define the topology of S2P in ER membranes. Both the NH2 and COOH termini of S2P face the cytosol. Most of S2P is hydrophobic and appears to be buried in the membrane. All three of the long hydrophilic sequences of S2P can be glycosylated, indicating that they all project into the lumen. The HEIGH sequence of S2P, which contains two potential zinc-coordinating residues, is contained within a long hydrophobic segment. Aspartic acid 467, located ∼300 residues away from the HEIGH sequence, appears to provide the third coordinating residue for the active site zinc. This residue, too, is located in a hydrophobic sequence. The hydrophobicity of these sequences suggests that the active site of S2P is located within the membrane in an ideal position to cleave its target, a Leu-Cys bond in the first transmembrane helix of SREBPs.

Animal cells maintain cholesterol homeostasis by regulating proteolysis of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins-1 and -2 (SREBP-1 and -2) 1The abbreviations used are: SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HSV, herpes simplex virus; LDL, low density lipoprotein; LDLR, LDL receptor; PNGase F, peptideN-glycosidase F; SRE-1, sterol regulatory element-1; S1P, Site-1 protease; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary.1The abbreviations used are: SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HSV, herpes simplex virus; LDL, low density lipoprotein; LDLR, LDL receptor; PNGase F, peptideN-glycosidase F; SRE-1, sterol regulatory element-1; S1P, Site-1 protease; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. (reviewed in Ref. 1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2959) Google Scholar). SREBPs are membrane-bound transcription factors attached to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes in a hairpin fashion (2Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). All SREBPs share a similar structure consisting of an NH2-terminal basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper transcription factor domain of ∼480 amino acids, a middle hydrophobic region of ∼80 amino acids containing two transmembrane domains separated by a short hydrophilic loop, and a long COOH-terminal domain of ∼590 amino acids. The NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains of SREBPs project into the cytosol. The hydrophilic loop between the two membrane-spanning sequences projects into the ER lumen (2Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In order to activate transcription, the NH2-terminal domain of the SREBP must be released from the membrane so that it can enter the nucleus. This release has been studied most extensively for one of the SREBPs, namely, SREBP-2. However, the mechanism appears to be similar for the other SREBPs (SREBP-1a and -1c) (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2959) Google Scholar). Release of the NH2-terminal domain is accomplished by a two-step proteolytic event that is regulated by sterols (3Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In sterol-depleted mammalian cells, this proteolysis is initiated by the Site-1 protease (S1P), which cleaves human SREBP-2 between the Leu522-Ser523 bond in the sequence RSVL S (4Duncan E.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Sakai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12778-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This cleavage requires formation of a complex between SREBP and SCAP, a polytopic membrane protein of the ER, and it is prevented when this complex is disrupted (5Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 6Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5785-5793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Cleavage at Site-1 breaks the covalent bond between the two transmembrane domains of SREBP-2, but both parts of the protein remain attached to the membrane. Cleavage by Site-2 protease is necessary to release the transcriptionally active NH2 terminus of SREBP-2 into the cytosol, from which it rapidly translocates into the nucleus. The released fragment terminates at leucine 484, suggesting that Site-2 protease cleaves between this residue and cysteine 485 (7Duncan E.A. Davé U.P. Sakai J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17801-17809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This bond is believed to lie within a membrane-spanning helix. Cleavage is dependent on an upstream tetrapeptide sequence, 478DRSR, which precedes the transmembrane sequence (3Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 8Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10379-10384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Cleavage at Site-1 is tightly regulated by sterols. When cultured cells are loaded with sterols, either by incubation with plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) or a mixture of cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol, this cleavage is abolished (9Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Cleavage at Site-2 is not directly regulated by sterols, but it cannot occur without prior cleavage at Site-1 (3Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Therefore, it occurs only in sterol-depleted cells. Upon entering the nucleus, the NH2-terminal domains of the SREBPs activate transcription of genes encoding multiple enzymes of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (e.g.3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, squalene synthase, and lanosterol synthase) and the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway (e.g. fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase) (reviewed in Refs. 1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2959) Google Scholar, 10Edwards P.A. Ericsson J. Curr. Opin.

They also directly activate transcription of the gene encoding the LDL receptor, which supplies cells with cholesterol and fatty acids from external sources. Sterols down-regulate the transcription of these genes by interfering with the proteolysis of SREBPs. This feedback regulation allows cells to maintain a steady membrane composition in a changing environment (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2959) Google Scholar). Our laboratory recently isolated a cDNA encoding a protein that is a candidate for the Site-2 protease. We named this protein S2P. The cDNA was identified by complementation cloning (12Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.-Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) in M19 cells, which are a mutant line of CHO cells that cannot cleave SREBPs at Site-2 (3Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). As a result of this defect, the M19 cells are unable to transcribe genes encoding cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes or the LDL receptor, and they are therefore cholesterol auxotrophs (3Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 12Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J.

Genet. 1994; 20: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). M19 cells fail to produce an mRNA encoding S2P, owing to a genomic rearrangement that disrupts the S2P gene (12Rawson R.B.

When transfected into M19 cells, the cDNA encoding S2P restores Site-2 cleavage of SREBPs and relieves the growth requirement for cholesterol. The human S2P cDNA encodes a protein of 519 amino acids that contains a consensus metalloprotease zinc-binding site, HEIGH (12Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.-Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Replacement of either of the two histidines or the glutamic acid destroys the ability of the S2P cDNA to restore SREBP cleavage in M19 cells (12Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.-Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that S2P is indeed a metalloprotease (14Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), but so far, multiple attempts to demonstrate protease activity of isolated S2P in vitro have failed. S2P differs from known metalloproteases in its extensive hydrophobicity, which suggests the existence of multiple membrane-embedded domains. The protein also contains a stretch of 23 contiguous serine residues beginning at amino acid 114 and a cysteine-rich region containing 10 cysteines (residues 285–377). These two domains constitute the most hydrophilic parts of the protein. A full understanding of the mechanism of the S2P cleavage reaction requires a more complete structural and functional analysis of S2P. In the current study, we propose a model for the membrane topology of S2P and test it through examination of patterns ofN-linked glycosylation and protease susceptibility. CHO-7 cells are a clone of CHO-K1 cells selected for growth in lipoprotein-deficient serum (15Metherall J.E. Goldstein J.L. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), owing to a deletion in the S2P gene (12Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T.

All vectors expressing S2P or S2P mutants were driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-enhancer in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). Expression vectors pCMV-HSV-S2P and pCMV-Myc-S2P have been previously described (12Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.-Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol.

Expression plasmids that encode S2P mutants were derived from the above mentioned plasmids using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The open reading frames of all expression vectors were sequenced in their entirety. Monolayers of human embryonic kidney 293 cells were set up on day 0 (4 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) and cultured in 8–9% CO2 at 37 °C in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. On day 2, the cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using an MBS kit (Stratagene) as described previously (2Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Three h after transfection, the cells were switched to fresh medium A supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, incubated overnight, and harvested on day 3. This assay is an indirect measure of the ability of S2P cDNAs to restore sterol-regulated transcriptional activity in transfected M19 cells using the pSRE-Luciferase reporter plasmid. On day 0, M19 cells were set up at 105 cells/22-mm well in medium B (a 1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 5% fetal calf lipoprotein-deficient serum) supplemented with 20 μmsodium oleate. On day 1, cells were transfected using the MBS kit as described previously (12Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.-Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol.

After incubation for 3 h at 35 °C and 3% CO2, the cells were switched to medium B supplemented with 50 μm sodium mevalonate, 50 μm sodium compactin, and 0.2% (v/v) ethanol that contained either no sterols or an amount of sterols that gave a final concentration of 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol plus 10 μg/ml cholesterol. On day 2, whole cell lysates were prepared and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities with substrates that generate chemiluminescence products as described (12Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G.

Duplicate monolayers of cells were scraped into the culture medium, centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged again as above. The cell pellet from each dish was resuspended in 0.4 ml of Buffer A (10 mm Hepes-KOH at pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1.9 μg/ml aprotinin), passed through a 22-gauge needle 30 times, and centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was then used to prepare a nuclear extract fraction as described (3Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The supernatant was centrifuged at 2 × 104 × g for 10 min, and the resulting pellet was designated the membrane fraction. 293 cells were harvested, and cell membranes were prepared as described above. The membrane pellets were suspended in 0.1 ml of Buffer B (Buffer A supplemented with 0.1m NaCl) or in Buffer B containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and rocked at 4 °C for 5 min. Varying amounts of trypsin were added in a volume of 2 μl, and the samples were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min in a final volume of 92 μl. The reactions were stopped by the addition (2 μl) of 400 units of soybean trypsin inhibitor, followed by the addition of 0.1 ml of Buffer C (125 mm Tris-HCl at pH 6.8, 8 m urea, and 5% (w/v) SDS) and 50 μl of Buffer D (150 mm Tris-HCl at pH 6.8, 15% SDS, 12.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 25% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue). The samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and subjected to SDS-PAGE on an 8% gel. Monolayers of 293 cells were set up for experiments and transfected as described above. Three h after transfection, cells were switched to medium A supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 h, the cells were harvested, and the pooled cells from four dishes were fractionated to obtain the membrane fraction. The 2 × 104 ×g pellets were resuspended in 180 μl of Buffer E (Buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 without protease inhibitors). Aliquots of the membrane fractions (40 μl) were digested by the indicated glycosidase as described in the figure legends. After digestion, 50 μl of Buffer C and 25 μl of Buffer D were added to each reaction, and the resulting samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was measured with a BCA kit (Pierce). Gels were calibrated with prestained molecular weight markers (New England Biolabs). Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Hybond C-extra nitrocellulose sheets (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated with monoclonal antibodies at the indicated concentration. Bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, affinity-purified donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.) using the ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Filters were exposed to ReflectionTM NEF-496 film (NEN Life Science Products) at room temperature for the indicated time. The top panelof Fig. 1 shows a hydropathy plot of S2P, and the middle panel shows the predicted membrane topology of the protein. The bottom panel shows the amino acid sequence with hydrophobic regions indicated by shading. The three hydrophilic segments that are believed to reside in the ER lumen are designated A–C. Hydrophobic segments that are postulated to lie within the membrane are denoted by dashed lines in themiddle panel. The sequence of S2P contains an uneven distribution of the charged amino acids lysine, arginine, glutamate, and aspartate (indicated byasterisks in the bottom panel of Fig. 1). Amino acids 1–20 are extremely hydrophobic and are predicted to constitute a membrane-spanning helix. Residues 21–70 are relatively hydrophilic with several charged amino acids. This is designated region A. Residues 71–107 are again hydrophobic and are predicted to insert into the membrane. These residues are followed by the second long hydrophilic segment, designated region B, which extends from residues 108–141. Region B contains 26 serines, 23 of which are contiguous. Residue 141 begins a very long hydrophobic sequence that ends at residue 258. This sequence is interrupted by a short hydrophilic sequence that begins with the HEIGH sequence at position 171 and extends to the arginine at 185. Four out of 15 residues in this segment are charged. The long sequence between residues 258 and 446, designated region C, contains numerous charged and polar amino acids. This sequence also contains multiple cysteines. The sequence between residues 447 and 476 contains only one charged amino acid and is predicted to dip into the membrane. It is followed by a short hydrophilic segment, residues 477–491, the location of which could not be assigned from these studies (see below). The protein terminates with another hydrophobic sequence extending from residues 492 to 519. The sole charged residue in this segment is the COOH-terminal arginine. S2P contains two sequences that conform to the Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus forN-linked glycosylation (asparagines 337 and 508) as indicated in Fig. 2. Asparagine 337 is in the cysteine-rich hydrophilic loop (region C), and asparagine 508 is in the COOH-terminal hydrophobic sequence. In order to determine whetherN-linked glycosylation occurs at either of these sites, we created mutants of S2P in which one or both of the asparagines were replaced with glutamine residues. We prepared expression vectors encoding wild-type or mutant S2P with two copies of an epitope tag from an HSV protein at the NH2 terminus. The plasmids were transiently transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells, membrane fractions were prepared, and these membranes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted with an antibody against the HSV epitope. Membranes from mock-transfected 293 cells showed no immunoreactivity with the anti-HSV antibody (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Epitope-tagged wild-type S2P migrated on the gel as a smear of bands between 45 and 49 kDa (lanes 2 and 6). When asparagine 337 was replaced with glutamine, only the smallest band (∼45 kDa) was observed (lane 3). When asparagine 508 was substituted with glutamine, the mobility was indistinguishable from wild-type (lane 4). Double mutants in which both asparagines were replaced with glutamines behaved in the same fashion as the single N337Q mutant (lane 5). These results indicate that the asparagine at position 337, but not the one at position 508, is glycosylated. We therefore infer that region C projects into the ER lumen. When extracts containing HSV-tagged wild-type S2P were treated with PNGase F, the mobility of the protein increased on SDS-PAGE, confirming that the protein contained an N-linked carbohydrate chain (Fig. 2B, lane 2). The same change was seen after treatment with endoglycosidase H (lane 3), but not with neuraminidase (lane 4). These data indicate that the carbohydrate chain of S2P has not been modified by α-mannosidase II, which is found in the cis-Golgi compartment, or by sialyltransferase, which is found in the trans-Golgi (20Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3761) Google Scholar). The experiments shown in Fig. 3 were designed to determine whether the function of S2P requires its glycosylation. For this purpose, we used M19 cells, which lack S2P, owing to a deletion in the S2P gene (12Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.-Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3A, M19 cells were transfected with an expression plasmid containing either no cDNA insert or a cDNA encoding the indicated HSV-tagged wild-type or mutant S2P. We cotransfected a reporter plasmid encoding luciferase driven by a promoter that contains three copies of sterol regulatory element-1 (SRE-1). After incubation in the presence or absence of sterols, the cells were harvested. The measured values for SRE-1 driven luciferase activity were normalized for transfection efficiency by measurement of β-galactosidase activity generated by a cotransfected plasmid encoding β-galactosidase driven by a sterol-independent promoter. In the absence of cotransfected S2P, luciferase activity was low in the absence or presence of sterols (empty vector). When wild-type pCMV-HSV-S2P was transfected, luciferase activity was high in the absence of sterols (closed bars) and was reduced to basal levels in their presence (open bars). As presented in detail earlier (12Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.-Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) these data indicate that wild-type S2P restores cleavage of SREBPs at Site-2, an event that occurs only after the sterol-regulated cleavage at Site-1. The single and double glycosylation site mutants of HSV-S2P also led to enhanced sterol-regulated transcription of the reporter gene, although this enhancement was somewhat reduced when compared with that produced by wild-type S2P. All proteins encoded by the transfected mutant constructs were expressed at levels similar to that of the wild-type (data not shown). To further test the activity of the nonglycosylated versions of S2P, we compared the ability of the cDNAs encoding wild-type and glycosylation-negative S2P to restore growth of M19 cells in cholesterol-depleted medium (Fig. 3B). When transfected with empty vector, the M19 cells grew in medium supplemented with cholesterol, mevalonate, and oleate, but they failed to grow in the absence of these ingredients, owing to the deficiency of nuclear SREBPs. When the M19 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding either wild-type or glycosylation-defective S2P, the cells gr"
https://openalex.org/W2046463738,"A novel, positive read-out assay that quantifies only sequence-specific nuclear activity of antisense oligonucleotides was used to evaluate morpholino and 2′-O-methyl sugar-phosphate oligonucleotides. The assay is based on modification of the splicing pathway of human β-globin pre-mRNA. In addition, scrape-loading of cells with oligonucleotides allows the separate assessment of intracellular antisense activity of the oligonucleotides and their ability to penetrate the cell membrane barrier. The results show that, with scrape-loading, the morpholino oligonucleotides were approximately 3-fold more effective in their intrinsic antisense activity than alternating phosphodiester/phosphorothioate 2′-O-methyl-oligoribonucleotides and 6–9- and almost 200-fold more effective than the exclusively phosphorothioate and phosphodiester derivatives, respectively. The morpholino oligonucleotides were over 20-fold more effective than the phosphorothioate 2′-O-methyl-oligoribonucleotides in free uptake from the culture media. The antisense activity of the morpholino oligonucleotides was detectable not only in monolayer HeLa cells but also in suspension K562 cells. Time course experiments suggest that both the free uptake and efflux of morpholino oligonucleotides are slow."
https://openalex.org/W1984029898,"The increased transcription and ultimate superinduction of the spermidine/spermineN 1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) gene has been associated with the antineoplastic activity of several new antitumor polyamine analogues. In sensitive tumor cell types, the transcriptional induction appears to be regulated by the constitutive association of the transcription factor Nrf-2 with the recently discovered polyamine-responsive element. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a new transcriptional cofactor, polyamine-modulated factor-1 (PMF-1), has been identified as a partner protein of Nrf-2 that, in combination with Nrf-2, regulates the polyamine analogue-induced transcription of SSAT. The human PMF-1 gene, located on chromosome 1 near the 1q12/1q21 border, yields an mRNA transcript of ∼1.2 kilobases that codes for a 165-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of ∼20 kDa. The PMF-1 mRNA appears to increase in response to analogue exposure only in analogue-responsive cells. In addition to the transcriptional regulation of SSAT, PMF-1 or similar factors should be considered in the regulation of other polyamine-dependent genes.

The initial induction of this enzyme occurs at the level of increased transcription in response to analogue treatment (12Fogel-Petrovic M. Shappell N.W. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19118-19125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Xiao L. Casero R.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 14Wang Y. Xiao L.

We have recently identified acis-acting polyamine-responsive element (PRE) and atrans-acting protein, the transcription factor Nrf-2, to be involved in the regulation of SSAT gene transcription (14Wang Y. Xiao L. Thiagalingam A. Nelkin B.D. Casero Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34623-34630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the Nrf-2 transcription factor appears to be constitutively expressed only in those tumor cell types capable of highly expressing SSAT. Furthermore, the binding of Nrf-2 to the PRE does not change in response to treatment with either the analogues or the natural polyamines as measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (14Wang Y. Xiao L. Thiagalingam A. Nelkin B.D. Casero Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34623-34630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The results of these recent studies suggest at least two possibilities: 1) PRE-bound Nrf-2 is altered by analogue treatment, leading to transcriptional activation, or 2) an additional factor that is induced by analogue exposure leads to transcriptional activation of the SSAT gene. In this study, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify and clone a newly identified human protein, polyamine-modulated factor-1 (PMF-1), that interacts with the leucine zipper region of Nrf-2 and activates SSAT transcription. Additionally, we demonstrate that this gene is rapidly induced in response to analogue treatment in a polyamine analogue-sensitive lung tumor cell line, strongly suggesting that PMF-1 mediates SSAT transcriptional induction by acting in cooperation with Nrf-2. These results also implicate the possibility that this or other transcriptional cofactors are important in the response of other genes regulated by the natural polyamines or their analogues and that PMF-1 may serve as a paradigm for understanding the increased requirement of polyamines in the transformed phenotype (15Smith M.K.

All oligonucleotides used in the experiments were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma, Roche Molecular Biochemicals and J. T. Baker Inc. For construction of plasmid pCR2.1/Nrf-2, reverse transcription-PCR was performed using the primer pair P1-P2 (see Fig. 1). A 2017-bp Nrf-2 cDNA (+27 to +2043 bp) fragment was derived from H157 mRNA. The PCR product was then ligated into the pCR2.1 vector. To construct plasmid pcDNA3.1/Nrf-2, the Nrf-2 cDNA fragment cut from pCR2.1/Nrf-2 by KpnI-EcoRV was inserted into the pcDNA3.1(−) vector digested with the same enzymes. To construct plasmid pcDNA3.1/PMF-1, the PMF-1 cDNA was cut from pCR2.1/PMF-1 with EcoRI-XhoI and cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector digested with the same restriction enzymes. The pBKH-93 plasmid was constructed as previously reported (14Wang Y. Xiao L. Thiagalingam A. Nelkin B.D. Casero Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34623-34630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To make pBKH-93/dPRE, the complementary oligonucleotides P3 and P4 (see Fig. 1) were annealed, and the protruding ends were filled with TaqDNA polymerase. The resulting 30-bp double-stranded DNA fragment containing two PRE elements in the same direction (GACCGCTATGACTAAGCG TATGACTAAGCG) was cloned into the pCR2.1 vector. The PRE-containing fragment was then excised byKpnI-XhoI digestion and inserted into pBKH-93 in the same restriction sites. Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed with the Matchmaker two-hybrid system. To construct the bait plasmids, the coding region of the Nrf-2 cDNA (+39 to +2043 bp) and the leucine zipper domain (+1338 to +2043 bp) of Nrf-2 protein were produced by PCR with pCR2.1/Nrf-2 as the template. The primers used to amplify full-length Nrf-2 (P5 and P7) or the Nrf-2 leucine zipper domain (P6 and P7) were designed to contain an XbaI or a SalI restriction site in the 5′-end, respectively (see Fig. 1, underlined sequences). The PCR products were digested with XbaI-SalI and then subcloned in frame into the same restriction sites in the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 in the pAS2.1 vector. To construct the pACT-2/H157 cDNA library, H157 cDNA was synthesized using the Promega cDNA synthesis system according to the manufacturer's protocol. The double-stranded cDNA was ligated to EcoRI adapters on both ends and then cloned into the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain in the pACT-2 vector, which had been digested withEcoRI and dephosphorylated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase. The pACT-2/H157 cDNA library was then screened by the “HIS3 Jump-Start” procedure according to the protocol from the manufacturer. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y190 cells were first transformed with bait plasmids and selected on synthetic dextrose medium lacking tryptophan (SD−Trp). The transformants grown on the SD−Trp medium were subsequently transformed with the pACT-2/H157 cDNA library and selected on medium lacking tryptophan and leucine (SD™rp−Leu). The clones co-transformed with the bait and library were collected and replated onto medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine (SD−Trp−Leu−His) with 30 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole to inhibit the leaking growth of Y190 cells. The clones selected in this step were further assayed for their β-galactosidase activity. The pACT-2 library plasmids were purified from individual positive clones and amplified in Escherichia coli. Sequencing of the cDNA insert in the positive clone was performed with a Perkin-Elmer ABI Automated DNA Sequencer. The P10 primer, representing the 5′-pLIB vector sequence upstream from the multiple cloning site, and the P11 primer, corresponding to sequence in the 3′-end of PMF-1 cDNA (997–1020 bp), were used to clone the PMF-1 cDNA from a human placental retroviral cDNA library into the pLIB vector (CLONTECH) by PCR. This PCR product was then subcloned into the pCR2.1 vector (pCR2.1/PMF-1). A human BAC library was screened to obtain the PMF-1 genomic sequence using the PCR protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Three pairs of primers used in the PCR screening were designed according to PMF-1 cDNA sequence (P12-P13, P14-P15, and P16-P17) (see Fig. 1). P-6 , the positive BAC library clone, was digested withHindIII restriction enzyme and subcloned into the pBluescript SK vector. The P-6 sublibrary was then screened for the clones containing PMF-1 genomic fragments (clones A, B, and E) by the colony lift procedure and subjected to Southern blot analysis with random primer-labeled (19Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21490) Google Scholar, 20Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar) PMF-1 cDNA. Another three PMF-1 genomic DNA fragments (clones AB, C, and D) were obtained by PCR techniques with the P-6 plasmid as the template. The DNA inserts in the positive clones were sequenced on the ABI Automated DNA Sequencer. The radiation hybrid screening technique with the Stanford G3 RH panel (Research Genetics) was used to determine the chromosomal location of PMF-1 as per the supplier's PCR protocol. The primers used for these reactions were P22 and P23 (see Fig. 1). 2Analysis of results was performed using the protocol at the Stanford web site.Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis was performed as previously reported (21Xiao L. Celano P. Mank A.R. Griffin C. Jabs E.W. Hawkins A.L. Casero R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) using the labeled 5-kb B and 10-kb E fragments (see Fig. 4A) as probes. In vitrotranscription and translation were performed with the TnT coupled transcription/translation lysate system using [α-35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified plasmid pcDNA3.1/PMF-1 was used as the template. The labeled translation products were separated by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film. Total cellular RNA from H157 and H82 cells was extracted using the acid phenol-guanidine isothiocyanate method (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Poly(A+) RNA was isolated using oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography following the manufacturer's directions. Ten μg of total RNA from H157 or H82 cells were separated on a denaturing 1.5% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde, transferred to GeneScreen membrane (NEN Life Science Products), and hybridized with a random primer-labeled PMF-1 cDNA as a probe. Blots were washed and reprobed with a 28 S ribosomal cDNA probe as a loading control. The human multiple-tissue Northern blot system was used to examine the expression of PMF-1 in various human tissues according to the manufacturer's protocol. For transient transfection, 2 × 105 H157 cells were seeded in a 35-mm diameter culture dish and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5 mm 2-difluoromethylornithine for 48 h to reduce endogenous polyamines and background transcription, as previously reported (14Wang Y. Xiao L. Thiagalingam A. Nelkin B.D. Casero Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34623-34630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The Lipofectin-mediated transfection was performed with 1.5 μg of luciferase reporter constructs as indicated under “Results” and 0.4 μg of control plasmid pSV-β-galactosidase according to the manufacturer's protocol. After a 5-h incubation, the DNA-Lipofectin complex-containing medium was replaced by RPMI 1640 medium containing 5 mm 2-difluoromethylornithine. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were exposed to 10 μm BENSpm for 2 h. The cells were harvested, quick-frozen, and subsequently prepared for luciferase activity measurements as per the instructions of the manufacturer. To account for variations in transfection efficiency, the luciferase activity was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity. The Nrf-2 transcription factor was found to be associated with the cell type-specific expression of SSAT in response to the antitumor polyamine analogues by binding to the newly identified PRE (14Wang Y. Xiao L. Thiagalingam A. Nelkin B.D. Casero Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34623-34630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, Nrf-2 was found to bind constitutively to the PRE, strongly suggesting an association with another protein that mediates the analogue-induced expression of SSAT. To identify proteins that can interact with Nrf-2 in the H157 cell line, the yeast two-hybrid screening technique was used. In initial experiments, two pAS2.1 constructs were used as bait: full-length Nrf-2 (amino acids 1–589) and the leucine zipper domain of Nrf-2 (amino acids 434–589). Each construct was fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. However, in testing, the full-length Nrf-2 fusion plasmid (pAS2.1/Nrf-2) strongly activated the lacZ and HIS3 reporter genes in the host Y190 cells in the absence of the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain (data not shown). Consequently, the bait plasmid containing only the leucine zipper domain of Nrf-2 (pAS2.1/Nrf-2-LZ) was used for further experimentation. An H157 cDNA library that expressed proteins fused to the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain was then constructed and screened by the HIS3 Jump-Start procedure (see “Experimental Procedures”). Thirty-three clones from ∼106 yeast transformants were identified that could activate the reporter genes. Inserts of the positive clones were amplified by PCR with Matchmaker 5′ (P8) and 3′ (P9) (Fig. 1) binding domain insert screening amplimers and digested with restriction enzyme AluI. Gel electrophoresis/ethidium bromide staining results demonstrated an identical insert of ∼1 kb (data not shown), which was designated as PMF-1. To confirm the interaction between the Nrf-2 leucine zipper domain and PMF-1, Y190 yeast cells were transformed with pAS2.1/Nrf-2-LZ alone, pACT-2/PMF-1 alone, or pAS2.1/Nrf-2-LZ and pACT-2/PMF-1 together. Transformants were then selected on SD−His−Leu−Trp medium containing 30 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Only clones co-transformed with pAS2.1/Nrf-2-LZ and pACT-2/PMF-1 grew on the selection medium, demonstrating transcriptional activation of the reporter gene (Fig. 2). Sequencing the insert in the positive clone (pACT-2/PMF-1) revealed a 958-bp cDNA that coded a novel Nrf-2 partner. To confirm the PMF-1 sequence, the cDNA was PCR-cloned using the retroviral cDNA library derived from human placenta. Using this method, a transcript of 1057 bp was identified. This clone contains 99 more bases in the 5′-end as compared with the cDNA obtained from the yeast two-hybrid assay. This message size correlates well with the mRNA length estimated by Northern blotting (see below). PMF-1 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 495 bp and is predicted to encode for a protein of 165 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 19.2 kDa (Fig. 3). The sequence surrounding the translational initiation codon (5′-GACACCATGG) is a nearly perfect consensus with the Kozak translational consensus sequence (23Kozak M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 108: 229-241Google Scholar, 24Kozak M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 115: 887-903Google Scholar, 25Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with 9 out of 10 matches for the proposed optimal context (5′-GCC(A/G)CCATGG). The polyadenylation signal sequence (AATAAA) is found at nucleotide 1025, 13 bp upstream from the poly(A) tail. A leucine zipper-like structure with IX6IX6IX5LX6L was found in the N-terminal region and is a possible domain responsible for the protein-protein interaction between Nrf-2 and PMF-1. To obtain the PMF-1 gene, the human BAC library was screened by PCR techniques. Screening at three consecutive levels of the library (BAC super pool library, BAC plate pool library, and BAC single clone library) resulted in the discovery of a positive clone, P-6 , which was used as a template for all three primer pairs (Fig. 1). To facilitate plasmid preparation and sequencing, the DNA insert in the P-6 clone was digested with HindIII and subcloned into the pBluescript SK vector. The P-6 subclone library was then screened by colony lift assay and Southern blot analysis with the PMF-1 cDNA probe. Three positive clones (A, B, and E) were found to contain the PMF-1 genomic fragments. The identification of DNA sequences of clones A, B, and E allowed for the design of new primers (Fig. 1) for cloning DNA sequences between A and B (fragment AB) and between B and E (fragments C and D) using the PCR technique with the P-6 plasmid as the template. The overall length of the assembled human PMF-1 genomic sequence from the above clones is ∼28 kb. These clones span the entire cDNA region of PMF-1 and define the five complete exons and four introns (Fig. 4A). Clone A also defines 11.2 kb upstream from the transcriptional start site. The sequences in the exon/intron junctions and the sizes of the introns and exons are shown in Table I. All of the splice junctions in the PMF-1 gene conform to consensus sequence established for splice donor (5′-GT(A/G)AGT-3′) and splice acceptor (5′-(Py)nN(C/T)AG-3′) sites (26Mount S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2783) Google Scholar). Exon 1 contains 111 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence and the first 41 bp of coding sequence. Exon 5 contains the sequence coding for the last 17 amino acids of PMF-1, the stop codon (TGA), and a 434-bp 3′-untranslated sequence of the PMF-1 cDNA.Table IExon/intron organization of the human PMF-1 geneExonExon sizeSequence at exon/intron junctionaExon sequences are in uppercase letters, and intron sequences are in lowercase letters.Intron sizeCodons interrupted5′-Splice donor3′-Splice acceptorbp1152GGC AG gtaaag—–cgccag C TAC∼20 kbSer142106ATC CGG gtgagt—–cttcag GAG GAA1203 bpArg49-Glu503101GCC TG gtgaga—–ctccag G CGC2559 bpTrp834196TGG CAG gtcagt—–tttcag GCT CTA3066 bpGln148-Ala1495488a Exon sequences are in uppercase letters, and intron sequences are in lowercase letters.

Chem. 1998; 273: 34623-34630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was identified in this region (−1450 to −1442 bp). This site has 8 out of 9 base pairs identical to the previously described PRE (14Wang Y. Xiao L. Thiagalingam A. Nelkin B.D. Casero Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34623-34630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and oriented in the antisense direction. Although several putative transcription factor-binding sites have been identified, further experimentation will be necessary to determine whether any of the identified sites have any actual function. It should be noted that, similar to SSAT (21Xiao L. Celano P. Mank A.R. Griffin C. Jabs E.W. Hawkins A.L. Casero R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the transcription of PMF-1 is driven by a TATA-less promoter. The radiation hybrid screening technique and the Stanford G3 RH panel were used to localize the human PMF-1 gene. Primers P22 and P23, spanning from within exon 4 into intron 4, were used, and the results indicate that the PMF-1 gene is on the long arm of chromosome 1 at the 1q12 locus. Since this region represents the large pericentric heterochromatin of 1q and the resolution of the markers determined from the radiation hybrid screening was not sufficient to precisely place PMF-1, fluorescentin situ hybridization analysis was performed to confirm the location of PMF-1. The results of 22 G-banded metaphase chromosome pairs indicated PMF-1 to be at the 1q12/1q21 border (14 of 22 signals were at the 1q12/1q21 border). In vitro transcription and translation of full-length PMF-1 cDNA produced a major band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼20 kDa, which agrees with the predicted open reading frame (Fig. 5). The expression of PMF-1 mRNA in a variety of normal human tissues was evaluated by Northern blot analyses. A 1.2-kb mRNA transcript of PMF-1 was observed and appears to be expressed almost ubiquitously, although at different levels, in multiple tissues. The heart and skeletal muscle were among the highest in PMF-1 expression, with significant levels expressed in the kidney and liver (Fig. 6). To determine if PMF-1 expression can be induced by treatment with the polyamine analogue BENSpm in a cell type-specific manner, total RNA from the analogue-sensitive H157 and analogue-insensitive H82 cells was analyzed by Northern blot analysis after a 24-h exposure to 10 μm BENSpm. Significant induction of PMF-1 mRNA was detected only in the polyamine analogue-sensitive cell line, H157 (Fig. 7). To further characterize the expression of PMF-1 in H157 cells, a time course analysis of BENSpm exposure was performed. PMF-1 was induced in a biphasic manner, peaking first at ∼4 h post-treatment and reaching levels >5-fold after a 24-h exposure to BENSpm (Fig. 8). It should be noted that longer treatment times of H157 cells with BENSpm are precluded since there is significant drug-induced toxicity between 12 and 24 h of exposure (3Casero R.A. Mank A.R. Saab N.H. Wu R. Dyer W.J. Woster P.M. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1995; 36: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27McCloskey D.E. Yang J. Woster P.M. Davidson N.E. Casero Jr., R.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 441-446PubMed Google Scholar). It is also important to note that, although the biphasic nature of PMF-1 expression was reproducible in several experiments, the biological significance of this observation is not currently known. Once a PMF-1 antibody is developed, definitive experiments will be performed to determine whether the biphasic nature of message expression is mirrored by protein expression.Figure 8Time course of PMF-1 induction by BENSpm in H157 cells. H157 cells were treated with 10 μmBENSpm for 0–24 h. Total cellular RNA was prepared, and 10-μg samples were subjected to sequential Northern blot analyses with labeled PMF-1 cDNA and 28 S ribosomal cDNA as a loading control. Results are expressed as a ratio of PMF-1 to 28 S ribosomal RNA. The data in this figure are from a single experiment representative of three individual experiments with comparable results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether PMF-1 could induce PRE-mediated transcription of the SSAT promoter, two reporter plasmids were constructed. One plasmid, pBKH-93, contains the minimal promoter region of the SSAT gene (−93 to −1 bp) upstream from the luciferase gene. The second plasmid, pBKH-93/dPRE, contains the minimal promoter region and a 30-bp oligonucleotide containing two PRE consensus sequences (14Wang Y. Xiao L. Thiagalingam A. Nelkin B.D. Casero Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34623-34630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (TATGACTAA) cloned into a site upstream from the minimal SSAT promoter in pBKH-93. For expression of Nrf-2 and PMF-1, the cDNAs of Nrf-2 and PMF-1 were cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector. A PRE-mediated induction of luciferase expression in the BENSpm-treated H157 cell line was demonstrated in the transient transfection assay using the PRE-containing construct pBKH-93/dPRE. Transfection of the reporter construct together with pcDNA3.1/PMF-1 (no addition of BENSpm) produced an increase in transcription that is comparable to the increase in luciferase activity observed after the addition of BENSpm without co-transfection with pcDNA3.1/PMF-1. Additional expression of Nrf-2 in the presence or absence of PMF-1 had little effect on the reporter construct expression (Fig. 9). These results demonstrate that PMF-1, not Nrf-2, is the limiting factor in this system and that an increase in PMF-1 in the presence or absence of the analogue can lead to a PRE-mediated increase in transcription. The superinduction of the rate-limiting step in polyamine catabolism, SSAT, has been implicated in the cytotoxic response of some tumor types to treatment with antineoplastic polyamine analogues (6Casero R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P.R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar, 9Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3715-3720PubMed Google Scholar,29Scemama J.-L. Grabie V. Seidel E.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G851-G856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although regulated at many levels, the first and necessary step is a modest increase in transcription (12Fogel-Petrovic M. Shappell N.W. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19118-19125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Rucksdeschel J.C. Finkelstein D.M. Ettinger D.S. Leech R.H. Mason B.A. Joss R.A. Vogl S. J. Clin. Oncol. 1986; 4: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The recently discovered PRE and associated Nrf-2 transcription factor necessary for the transcriptional induction of SSAT provided an excellent lead for defining other proteins required in the transcriptional regulation of SSAT. That Nrf-2 was found to be constitutively bound to the PRE in sensitive cell types even in the absence of treatment suggested that other factors were involved in the induction response (14Wang Y. Xiao L. Thiagalingam A. Nelkin B.D. Casero Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34623-34630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this work, a transcriptional cofactor has been identified using the yeast two-hybrid system. This factor, designated PMF-1, binds to the leucine zipper region of Nrf-2, resulting in increased transcription. More important, PMF-1 demonstrates a cell type-specific response to analogue exposure. Specifically, PMF-1 appears to be induced only in the analogue-responsive cell types. Furthermore, using a luciferase reporter construct system, PMF-1 is capable of inducing PRE-regulated transcription, even in the absence of analogue. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that Nrf-2 is constitutively expressed in H157 cells and that an increase in PMF-1, either as a result of analogue treatment or by direct transfection, is capable of increasing PRE-mediated transcription in human cells. However, it is currently not known whether preexisting PMF-1 protein is important in the activation of SSAT expression or if newly synthesized protein is required. These experiments will require the development of an antibody against the new PMF-1 protein. Although it is apparent from the yeast two-hybrid system results that PMF-1 binds to the leucine zipper region of Nrf-2, it is not currently known what region of PMF-1 interacts with the leucine zipper. Primary structure analysis of PMF-1 demonstrates an amino acid stretch in the N-terminal region that resembles a leucine zipper motif. Mutation analysis of the N-terminal region will be required to determine whether it is specifically involved in heterodimer formation with Nrf-2. It is important to note that previous studies have demonstrated that Nrf-2 activates transcription when heterodimerized with a member of the small Maf protein family (31Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). PMF-1 has no amino acid homology to any of the known Maf family members; therefore, PMF-1 appears to be a structurally unique partner of Nrf-2. Although PMF-1 clearly plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of SSAT, it is possible that it may be responsible for the regulation of other genes, in combination with either Nrf-2 or other potential partners. It may be significant that the highest expression of PMF-1 in normal tissues occurs in tissues that are highly differentiated, including heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver. The possibility that PMF-1 expression is involved in differentiation or is inversely proportional to growth cannot presently be excluded. Again, it is important to emphasize that the relative amounts of PMF-1 protein may be critically important in determining its role in transcriptional regulation for both SSAT and other potential gene targets in response to various stimuli. However, the performance of studies to investigate PMF-1 protein levels and roles will require the development of a PMF-1-specific antibody. It has been demonstrated that c-Myc transcription is negatively regulated by polyamine depletion in several tumor types along with other growth-related genes (32Celano P. Baylin S.B. Casero Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8922-8927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Patel A.R. Wang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1020-C1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Bryans M. Harley E.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that the depletion of polyamines by 2-difluoromethylornithine or the alteration of polyamine metabolism through the use of analogues leads to cell cycle arrest and can induce apoptosis through a p53-mediated mechanism (36Ray R.M. Zimmerman B.J. McCormack S.A. Patel T.B. Johnson L.R. Am. Phys. Soc. 1999; 276: C684-C691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Kramer D.L. Vujcic S. Diegelman P. Alderfer J. Miller J.T. Black J.D. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1278-1286PubMed Google Scholar). Since polyamines and polyamine biosynthetic enzyme activities are typically higher in tumors than in surrounding normal tissue (38Luk G.D. Baylin S.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 311: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 39Giardiello F.M. Hamilton S.R. Hylind L.M. Yang V.W. Tamez P. Casero Jr., R.A.

Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the resulting higher polyamine content may play a role in the regulation of genes associated with the neoplastic phenotype. Recent studies using the overexpression of ornithine decarboxylase as a means of determining the transformation potential of increased polyamine biosynthesis suggest that the expression of both growth-related and transformation-related genes may have an altered requirement for polyamines (15Smith M.K.

Since Arg41 is adjacent to the switch 1 region of Ras, ADP-ribosylation could interfere with Ras-mediated signal transduction via several mechanisms, including interaction with Raf, or guanine nucleotide exchange factor-stimulated or intrinsic nucleotide exchange. Initial experiments showed that ADP-ribosylated Ras (ADP-r-Ras) and unmodified Ras (Ras) interacted with Raf with equal efficiencies, indicating that ADP-ribosylation did not interfere with Ras-Raf interactions. While ADP-r-Ras and Ras possessed equivalent intrinsic nucleotide exchange rates, guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Cdc25) stimulated the nucleotide exchange of ADP-r-Ras at a 3-fold slower rate than Ras. ADP-r-Ras did not affect the nucleotide exchange of Ras, indicating that the ADP-ribosylation of Ras was not a dominant negative phenotype. Ras-R41K and ADP-r-Ras R41K possessed similar exchange rates as Ras, indicating that ADP-ribosylation at Arg128 did not inhibit Cdc25-stimulated nucleotide exchange. Consistent with the slower nucleotide exchange rate of ADP-r-Ras as compared with Ras, ADP-r-Ras bound its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Cdc25) less efficiently than Ras in direct binding experiments. Together, these data indicate that ADP-ribosylation of Ras at Arg41 disrupts Ras-Cdc25 interactions, which inhibits the rate-limiting step in Ras signal transduction, the activation of Ras by its guanine nucleotide exchange factor."

To overcome this barrier, we developed an artificial receptor based on expression of a novel sugar.

ManLev was metabolized and incorporated into cell-surface glycoconjugates. The synthetic sugar decorated the cell surface with a unique ketone group that served as a foundation on which we built an adenovirus receptor by covalently binding biotin hydrazide to the ketone.

In many cells, lack of appropriate cell surface receptors is a major barrier to efficient viral-mediated gene transfer. One strategy to overcome this barrier is to chemically or genetically engineer new ligands onto the virus so that it will bind to existing cell receptors (1Kasahara N. Dozy A.M. Kan Y.W. Science. 1994; 266: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 2Wickham T.J. Carrion M.E. Kovesdi I. Gene Ther. 1996; 2: 750-756Google Scholar, 3Krasnykh V. Dmitriev I. Mikheeva G.

A hypothetical second strategy would be to engineer the cell surface to display new receptors for existing gene transfer vectors. The goal of this work was to explore this second strategy. N-Acetylneuraminic acid, a member of the sialic acid family, is the most abundant terminal sugar residue on mammalian cell glycoproteins and glycolipids (4Corfield A.P. Schauer R. Schauer R. Sialic Acids: Chemistry, Metabolism, and Function. Springer-Verlag, Vienna1982Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of this sialic acid requires extensive enzymatic modification ofN-acetylmannosamine before incorporation into the terminal position on oligosaccharides and expression on the cell surface (5Warren L. Bound Carbohydrates in Nature. Cambridge University Press, New York1994Crossref Google Scholar, 6Varki A. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The cellular enzymes responsible for synthesis ofN-acetylneuraminic acid are known to tolerate substitutions at the N-acyl position of N-acetylmannosamine. When various N-acylmannosamines were present in the culture medium, modified sialic acids were incorporated into carbohydrates and expressed on the cell surface (7Keppler O.T. Stehling P. Herrmann M.

Likewise, intraperitoneal injection of modified monosaccharides allowed expression of their metabolites on serum glycoproteins in rats (9Kayser H. Zeitler R. Kannicht C. Grunow D. Nuck R. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16934-16938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bertozzi and co-workers (10Mahal L.K. Yarema K.J. Bertozzi C.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) constructed a modified mannosamine that replaced the acetyl group with a levulinate group (named ManLev). They found that ManLev was metabolically incorporated into glycoconjugates and expressed on the surface of three cell lines. A unique feature of ManLev is that it places a ketone group on the cell surface. Because ketone groups are virtually absent from the surface of cells, metabolic incorporation of ManLev provides a novel functional group to which other molecules can be attached (10Mahal L.K. Yarema K.J. Bertozzi C.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that ManLev could be used to create novel artificial viral receptors that would enhance adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in poorly infected cells. NIH-3T3 were cultured on 8-well plastic slides (Nalge #177445, Naperville, IL) in Dulbecco's minimal essential media (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) 1The abbreviations used are: HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. were isolated as described previously (11Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar) and plated on 8-well plastic slides in Media 199 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin; the purity of HUVEC cells was >98%. A recombinant adenovirus vector expressing β-galactosidase (Ad2/LacZ) was prepared as described previously (12Zabner J. Zeiher B.G. Friedman E. Welsh M.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6994-7003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by the University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core at titers of approximately 2 × 1010 IU/ml (particle/infectious unit ratio was approximately 50). The virus was applied to cells under indicated conditions at a multiplicity of infection of 100. Two anti-adenovirus monoclonal antibodies were used, an antibody directed against fiber knob (1D6, a generous gift of Dr. David Curiel, University of Alabama at Birmingham) and an antibody directed against the fiber shaft (5C91, a generous gift of Dr. Beverly Davidson and Richard Anderson, University of Iowa). Antibody 1D6 inhibits infection by blocking fiber binding; antibody 5C91 does not inhibit infection. Both antibodies gave similar results in the binding and expression experiments. NeutrAvidin was coupled to the antibodies by sulfhydryl linkage to the interchain sulfhydryl groups using maleimide-activated NeutrAvidin as recommended by the manufacturer (Pierce). Antibody conjugates were separated from unreacted NeutrAvidin by purification through protein G columns. The final concentration of the purified NeutrAvidin/antibody conjugate was approximately 0.5 mg/ml. When the products of the reaction were examined by nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the NeutrAvidin/antibody conjugate showed the expected electrophoretic shift (not shown). In addition, the NeutrAvidin/antibody conjugate was functional for adenovirus binding and biotin binding in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with adenovirus bound to a plate and detection with biotinylated horseradish peroxidase (not shown). SolidN-hydroxysuccinimide (1.86 g, 16.11 mmol) was added to levulinic acid (1.70 g, 14.65 mmol) in CH2Cl2(30 ml). The reaction mixture was cooled to 0 °C, and 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (3.09 g, 16.11 mmol) was added. After 10 min, the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight. The solution was diluted with CH2Cl2, washed with H2O (3 × 60 ml), saturated NaHCO3 (2 × 60 ml), and brine. After the organic phase was dried over MgSO4 and filtered, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to yieldN-hydroxysuccinimide-Lev (2.65 g, 85%): 1H NMR δ 2.89 (m, 4H), 2.83 (s, 4H), 2.21 (s, 3H). The hydroxide form of the DEAE-cellulose (Bio-Rad, 5 g) was allowed to stir in 1 m aqueous NaOH (100 ml) for 1.5 h. The resulting slurry was filtered and rinsed thoroughly with H2O (4 × 100 ml). The resulting solid was air-dried, and the remaining traces of H2O were removed under vacuum to give an off-white material with a Styrofoam-like appearance. A solution of NaOCH3 was prepared from Na+metal (30 mg, 1.27 mmol) and CH3OH (7 ml) at 0 °C. Once the reaction was complete, d-mannosamine hydrochloride (250 mg, 1.16 mmol) was added in one portion, and the resulting mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. After 20 min, dried DEAE-cellulose (500 mg) prepared as described above was added, and the mixture was allowed to stir for an additional 45 min.N-Hydroxysuccinimide-Lev (272 mg, 1.27 mmol) in 2 ml CH2Cl2 was added via cannula, and the suspension was stirred overnight. The resulting slurry was filtered through Celite and rinsed with CH3OH, and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to produce an off-white oily residue. This material was further dried under high vacuum to produce an off-white foam, which was purified by flash column chromatography (14 to 20% CH3OH in CHCl3) to provide ManLev (222 mg, 69%): 1H NMR δ 5.12 (d, J = 1.5 Hz, 0.6H), 5.03 (d, J = 1. 5 Hz, 0.4H), 4.46 (dd, J = 4.2, 1.5 Hz, 0.4H), 4.32 (dd, J = 4.8, 1.5 Hz, 0.6H), 4.06 (dd, J = 9.6, 4.8 Hz, 0.6H), 3.93–3.79 (m, 3H), 3.64 (dd, J 9.9, 9.6 Hz, 0.6H), 3.53 (dd, J = 9.9, 9.6 Hz, 0.4H), 3.42 (ddd, J = 9.9, 4.8, 2.1 Hz, 0.4H), 2.92–2.85 (m, 2H), 2.63 (t, J = 6.9 Hz, 0.8H), 2.58 (t, J = 6.9 Hz, 1.2H), 2.25 (s, 1. 2H), 2.24 (s, 1. 8H);13C (major epimer) δ 216.9, 178.6, 96.0, 74.8, 71.7, 69.6, 63.3, 56.0, 41.0, 32.1, 28.0. Cells were cultured for 48 h with control media or media supplemented with 30 mm ManLev. Cells were rinsed once with 500 μl of Eagle's minimal essential medium, and biotin-LC-hydrazide (Pierce) (10 mm in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) was applied to cells at room temperature for 1.5 h, which preliminary studies showed to be optimal. The cells were rinsed with cold media to remove excess biotin hydrazide. Cells were then briefly trypsinized and rinsed in cold media. Streptavidin-FITC (1 μg/ml, Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) in PBS was applied for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were then rinsed in 5 ml of cold media. Relative fluorescence was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Becton Dickinson, Mansfield, MA). For direct inspection of fluorescence after streptavidin-FITC treatment, cells were rinsed twice with 500 μl of cold media and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. To evaluate virus association with cells, adenovirus was labeled with the carbocyanine dye Cy3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using methods described by Leopoldet al. (13Leopold P.L. Ferris B. Grinberg I. Worgall S. Hackett N.R. Crystal R.G. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Cy3 was covalently conjugated to capsid proteins of adenovirus by mixing 5 nmol of Cy3 with 1012particles of virus in 1.5 ml of Na2CO3 at pH 9.0 for 2 h at 4 °C. The solution was subsequently transferred to a dialysis chamber (Slide-A-Lyzer, 10,000 molecular mass cutoff, Pierce) and dialyzed against two changes of PBS, 3% sucrose, pH 7.4 at 4 °C for 24 h. To attach labeled virus to cells with artificial viral receptors, NIH-3T3 cells were labeled with 10 mmbiotin-LC-hydrazide as described above and treated with 50 μl NeutrAvidin/antibody conjugate (0.5 mg/ml) in PBS on ice for 30 min. Cells were rinsed with cold media, and 1 × 1010adenovirus particles were applied for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were rinsed twice with cold media and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. Fluorescence was assayed by confocal microscopy. To evaluate binding of particles, we applied streptavidin-coated yellow/green 40-nm FluoSpheres (f-8780, Molecular Probes, Euguene, OR) to cells treated with biotin hydrazide. β-Galactosidase activity was measured 24 h after application of vector as described previously (14Fasbender A.

Individual experiments were performed using three sets of cells, and all experiments were repeated at least three times. Earlier work showed that when three immortalized cell lines, Jurkat, HL-60, and HeLa, were fed ManLev, the sugar was metabolized, and the downstream product,N-levulinoyl sialic acid, incorporated into cell surface oligosaccharides in place of the natural sialic acid (10Mahal L.K. Yarema K.J. Bertozzi C.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). To test the potential utility of this system, we asked if ManLev could be incorporated into other cell lines and into primary cultures of human cells. We added ManLev (30 mm) to the culture medium and assayed expression of cell surface ketones by the covalent binding of biotin hydrazide to cells followed by detection with streptavidin-FITC. Fig. 1 shows that when primary cultures of HUVEC were fed ManLev, the coupling of biotin hydrazide increased, as evidenced by a 200-fold fluorescence shift on flow cytometry analysis and by direct inspection with fluorescence microscopy. There was little fluorescence in cells not fed ManLev. The increase in cell surface ketones was not restricted to HUVEC cells or to human cell lines; we saw a 25-fold increase in mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, a 180-fold increase in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293), a 20-fold increase in dog kidney epithelial cells (Madin-Darby canine kidney cells), a 35-fold increase in primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells, and a 200-fold increase in human cervical carcinoma-derived cells (HeLa) (not shown). The formation of a hydrazone bond between biotin hydrazide and the unnatural sialic acid will depend on the concentration of both substrates. Earlier work showed that a concentration of 20–40 mm ManLev in the culture medium yielded maximum expression of ketones on the surface of Jurkat cells (10Mahal L.K. Yarema K.J. Bertozzi C.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). We obtained similar results with HUVEC, NIH-3T3, and 293 cells (not shown). To examine the effect of the amount of hydrazide, we varied the concentration of biotin hydrazide applied to HUVEC cells that had been grown in ManLev (30 mm) for 2 days. Fluorescence was assayed after the addition of streptavidin-FITC. Fig. 2shows a concentration-dependent increase in the fluorescence shift as the concentration of biotin hydrazide increased. At concentrations of biotin hydrazide less than 5 μm, we did not detect a shift in fluorescence. This suggests that μm concentrations of hydrazide are required to detectably modify the cell surface, although the relative sensitivity of the assay is not known. Labeling the cell surface with small molecules requires formation of a hydrazone band and then the biotin/streptavidin interaction. This conclusion is supported by the finding that elimination of ManLev or any one of the steps in the reaction prevents labeling. Competition experiments also support this conclusion. Fig. 3 shows that when excess nonbiotinylated hydrazide (adipic dihydrazide or 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionyl hydrazide) or excess unlabeled streptavidin were added to the reaction, labeling was blocked. To be useful for gene transfer, the modified cell surface will have to bind particles the size of viruses. Many ketones expressed on the cell surface might be sterically hindered and thus not accessible for binding virus. To test if the incorporated ketones were accessible to virus-size particles, we grew HUVEC cells with and without 30 mm ManLev and treated the surface with biotin hydrazide followed by 40-nm streptavidin-coated fluorescent beads. As shown in Fig. 4, the fluorescent beads virtually coated the surface of the ManLev-fed cells (C and D), whereas control cells (A and B) showed very little binding of beads, suggesting that this method could attach viral-sized particles to the cell surface. To test the hypothesis that the ketone-hydrazide reaction could enhance binding of gene transfer vectors, we studied recombinant adenovirus. We chose not to directly chemically modify the viral capsid to display a hydrazide because our preliminary attempts to chemically link a hydrazide to adenovirus inactivated the virus (14Fasbender A. Zabner J. Chillon M. Moninger T.O. Puga A.P. Davidson B.L. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6479-6489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). 2J. H. Lee, T. J. Baker, L. K. Mahal, J. Zabner, C. R. Bertozzi, D. F. Wiemer, and M. J. Welsh, unpublished observations.. Therefore, to test the concept, we chose an alternate strategy (Fig. 5), using the uniquely reactive ketones as chemical handles for attaching artificial virus receptors; in our case we used biotin hydrazide and then a NeutrAvidin-conjugated anti-adenovirus antibody. The goal was to adorn the cell surface with these artificial receptors. Adenovirus normally binds to cells via an interaction between its fiber protein and the cellular coxsackie-adenoviral receptor (15Bergelson J.M. Cunningham J.A. Droguett G. Kurt-Jones E.A. Krithivas A. Hong J.S. Horwitz M.S. Crowell R.L. Finberg R.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1320-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose NIH-3T3 cells for these studies because they lack this receptor, they do not readily bind adenovirus, and they are resistant to infection (16Seth P. Rosenfeld M. Higginbotham J. Crystal R.G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 933-940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To learn whether we could create a viral receptor that would enhance adenovirus binding to NIH-3T3 cells, we grew cells with and without ManLev and treated them with biotin hydrazide. We then exposed cells to the NeutrAvidin/antibody conjugate to generate a viral receptor. Finally, we applied Cy3-labeled adenovirus for 30 min and examined the cell surface using fluorescence confocal microscopy. Fig. 6 shows that virus bound only the ManLev-fed cells on which we had constructed the artificial receptor. In contrast, there was little or no bound virus in cells not fed ManLev or that lacked the NeutrAvidin/antibody conjugate. To test the hypothesis that increased binding could enhance gene transfer, we applied a recombinant adenovirus that expresses β-galactosidase to NIH-3T3 cells on which we had built an artificial adenovirus receptor as described above. Fig. 7A shows that the engineered receptors increased expression approximately 50-fold. Enhancement required that the cells were fed ManLev, and the cell surface was treated with biotin hydrazide. We also tested expression in primary cultures of HUVEC cells; the engineered receptor enhanced gene transfer approximately 9-fold (Fig. 7B). Enhanced expression required incorporation of ManLev and the NeutrAvidin/antibody conjugate. These results demonstrate that an engineered receptor can increase virus binding and enhance gene transfer. The smaller relative increase in HUVEC cells (9-fold) versus 3T3 cells (50-fold) might reflect a lower density of ketone-bearing sialic acids on the HUVEC cells. It is worthy of note that rapidly dividing cells have been shown to express unnatural sialic acids at a higher level than slowly dividing cells (17Yarema K.J. Mahal L.K. Bruehl R.E. Rodriguez E.C. Bertozzi C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31168-31179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The NIH-3T3 cells may engage in higher levels ofde novo glycoprotein biosynthesis, resulting in higher levels of cell surface ketones and, correspondingly, higher densities of artificial adenovirus receptors. Nonspecific binding of the conjugate to the cell surface might account for the higher level of transgene expression under control conditions such as in the absence of biotin hydrazide (Fig. 7A). These results demonstrate that an engineered receptor can increase virus binding and enhance gene transfer. Lack of cellular receptors to bind vectors currently limits gene transfer in a number of applications. We have taken a novel strategy to create a new cell surface receptor for an adenovirus vector. Fig. 5schematically outlines the approach. ManLev included in the culture medium was biosynthetically converted to an unnatural sialic acid and incorporated into cell surface glycoconjugates. Thus, the cells were engineered to display a novel ketone on the cell surface. The ketone group provided a unique chemical handle to which we covalently attached biotin hydrazide. Biotin, in turn, was coupled to NeutrAvidin linked to an antibody specific to adenovirus. With this artificial receptor on the cell surface, binding and gene transfer with recombinant adenoviruses increased in cells that are normally resistant to adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. This novel approach has several potential advantages. Because display of unique functional groups is accomplished through the biosynthetic processes of the cell, the method provides an opportunity to modify the cell surface simply by providing a readily incorporated substrate. Thus, it could potentially be applied to many different cell types, as evidenced by the successful incorporation of ketones onto primary human cell cultures and cell lines and cells from other species. Importantly, this strategy is targeted at the first, often rate-limiting step in gene transfer, vector binding to the cell surface. There are also opportunities for use of unnatural carbohydrate substrates other than ManLev; for example, the target monosaccharide or side chain could be changed and display of functional groups other than ketones may be feasible. Although we used an adenovirus vector to test the concept, the method is potentially applicable to creation of receptors or targets for other viral vectors as well as for nonviral vectors. Conversely, unique sugar groups might be incorporated into surface glycoproteins on viral vectors by feeding synthetic sugars to virus-producing cell lines. The successful facilitation of gene transfer in vitrounderscores the utility of this approach, but there remain limitations. One limitation is the complexity of the strategy depicted in Fig. 5. Three steps were used to enhance adenovirus binding and gene expression: incubation of cells with ManLev, application of biotin hydrazide, and addition of NeutrAvidin/antibody conjugates. Because each step will have some limitation in efficiency, this complexity will likely limit the number of functional receptors formed. Thus, an important future goal is to reduce the intermediate steps involved in receptor construction to achieve direct attachment of vectors to metabolically engineered cells. Another limitation is the high concentration of ManLev we used. This limitation might be circumvented in several ways, for example, by acetylation of the sugar to enhance entry into cells (18Sarkar A.K. Fritz T.A. Taylor W.H. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3323-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies suggest that the same number of cell surface ketones generated by ManLev treatment can be obtained by treatment of cells with peracetylated ManLev at concentrations approximately 200-fold lower. 3C. R. Bertozzi, unpublished observations. Thus, future applications of the technique might be accomplished with either high concentrations of the free sugar, which is more conveniently prepared, or lower concentrations of an acetylated or otherwise modified sugar if concentration is an issue. The ability to use an unnatural sugar introduced into many different cellular glycoproteins and glycolipids suggests that adenovirus can use artificial receptors for infection; the endogenous adenovirus receptor CAR (coxsackie-adenoviral receptor) (15Bergelson J.M. Cunningham J.A. Droguett G. Kurt-Jones E.A. Krithivas A. Hong J.S. Horwitz M.S. Crowell R.L. Finberg R.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1320-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar) is not essential. The conclusion that specificity in binding is not required for adenovirus infection is supported by earlier work in which an increase in nonspecific binding improved gene transfer to adenovirus-resistant cells (14Fasbender A. Zabner J. Chillon M. Moninger T.O. Puga A.P. Davidson B.L. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6479-6489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 19Wickham T.J.

Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 507-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The fact that enhancement of binding, even that which is not specific, can facilitate gene transfer suggests the feasibility of future approaches that alter either the viral capsid or the cell surface to introduce new ligands and/or receptors. Our data suggest the feasibility of a gene transfer strategy in which the biosynthetic machinery of the cell is used to engineer novel receptors on the cell surface. Such a strategy might provide significant advantages for ex vivo gene transfer applications in which the target cell is relatively resistant to a vector that otherwise might have significant advantages. Could a similar strategy be developed for in vivo gene transfer? There are several additional considerations. First, any cell decorated with sialic acid could potentially be modified with ketone groups; cells with the highest flux in the sialic acid pathway would likely display the greatest number of ketones on their surface. Thus, one would not expect to achieve significant selectivity among cell types. In some cases this could be an advantage. However, in other cases targeting might require selective delivery, for example into the airway lumen, into the brain, etc. Thus, the development of mechanisms for delivering ManLev or other carbohydrates to specific tissues is a subject of current interest. Second, as described above, the current system is too complex for in vivo use, and some of the reagents (e.g. NeutrAvidin) would be immunogenic. Future modifications and developments would be required for in vivouse, with a focus on eliminating the need for intermediate protein conjugates between virus particles and unnatural cell surface epitopes. Third, considerations of efficiency are similar to those with other vectors; studies in animals will be required to learn where the general strategy we describe can also increase gene transfer to resistant cellsin vivo. Finally, safety considerations would be critical. In earlier studies, Keppler et al. (7Keppler O.T. Stehling P. Herrmann M. Kayser H. Grunow D. Reutter W. Pawlita M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1308-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) administeredN-propanoyl-d-mannosamine and N-propanoyl-d-glucosamine intraperitoneally to rats; there were no adverse effects, and substitution of nativeN-acetylneuramic acid residues with nonnative analogs occurred in all organs. However, additional studies of safety would be required. Still it is possible that short term administration of future generations of unnatural sugars, receptors, and vectors could prove to be an effective means of facilitating gene transfer.

https://openalex.org/W1974427667,"Yersinia enterocolitica inject toxic proteins (effector Yops) into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells by a mechanism requiring the type III machinery. Previous work mapped a signal sufficient for the targeting of fused reporter proteins to amino acids 1-100 of YopE. Targeting requires the binding of SycE to YopE residues 15-100 in the bacterial cytoplasm. We asked whether SycE functions only to stabilize YopE in the bacterial cytoplasm, or whether the secretion chaperone itself contributes to substrate recognition by the type III machinery. Fusions of glutathione S-transferase to either the N or C terminus of SycE resulted in hybrid proteins that bound YopE but prevented targeting of the export substrate into HeLa cells. As compared with wild-type SycE, glutathione S-transferase-SycE bound and stabilized YopE in the bacterial cytoplasm but failed to release the polypeptide for export by the type III machinery. Thus, it appears that SycE functions to deliver YopE to the type III secretion machinery. A model is presented that accounts for substrate recognition of effector Yops, a group of proteins that do not share amino acid sequence or physical similarities."

Three families of PLC isoforms have been described in mammals: PLCβ, PLCδ, and PLCγ (2Rhee S.G. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Lee S.Y. Science. 1989; 244: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). The members of each family are highly homologous to one another at the amino acid sequence level, but little identity exists between members of different families (2Rhee S.G. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Lee S.Y. Science. 1989; 244: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Three exceptions to this divergence in structure are the catalytic domain, the C2 domain, and the N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (1Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol.

Although much is known about the function of the PH domain in PLCδ1, very little is known about another lipid binding motif, the C2 domain. The C2 domain comprises approximately 130 amino acid residues and has been found in nearly 100 signaling molecules (10Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The C2 domain was first identified in protein kinase C, and its function was implicated in Ca2+-dependent phospholipid interactions (11Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Structural studies estimate three to four divalent metal binding sites in the C2 domain of PLCδ1 (12Essen L.O. Perisic O. Lynch D.E. Katan M. Williams R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2753-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The C2 domain in the C terminus of PLCδ1 is essential for catalysis, because partial deletion of the C2 domain results in an inactive enzyme (13Yagisawa H. Hirata M. Kanematsu T. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S.

However, the molecular mechanism by which C2 domain functions in PLCδ1 catalysis still awaits further investigation. PLC is a prototype for enzymes that operate at an interface. As for other membrane-associated enzymes, the ability of PLC to catalyze the hydrolysis of PI or PIP2 is influenced remarkably by the presence of nonsubstrate phospholipids in the membrane (14Jones G.A.

The molecular mechanisms by which nonsubstrate phospholipid affects PLC activity is largely unknown. Nonsubstrate phospholipids could alter the structure of the PLC-membrane interface or the net charge of the interface or could promote a specific interaction between enzyme and interface. This report examines the effect of nonsubstrate phospholipids on the activity of PLCδ1 and examines the role of Ca2+ in this response. These experiments revealed that PLCδ1 was specifically stimulated by PS. PS stimulates the substrate affinity of the enzyme by virtue of its ability to bind the PLCδ1 via C2 domain in a Ca2+-dependent manner. We propose that Ca2+ regulates PLCδ1 activity by promoting the formation of an enzyme-PS-Ca2+ ternary complex, which leads to activation via a 20-fold reduction in the Km for substrate. The expression vector pRSETA was from Invitrogen. To express PLCδ1 under the control of the T7 promoter, the coding sequence for PLCδ1 was cloned into pRSETA. The resulting expression construct (pRSETAplc) was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLys (Novagen), and the protein was isolated and purified as described previously (20Cheng H.-F.

The phospholipid film was hydrated under nitrogen with 0.5 ml of nitrogen-aerated 0.18 m sucrose for 18 h at 4 °C followed by mixing with an equal volume of distilled H2O. Vesicles were isolated from the pellet by centrifuging the hydrated phospholipids at 1200 × g for 20 min. The phospholipid vesicles were washed once with 1 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA (binding buffer) and resuspended in 0.5 ml of the same buffer. The binding of PLCδ1 to phospholipid vesicles was estimated by a centrifugation assay (20Cheng H.-F. Jiang M.-J. Chen C.-L. Liu S.-M. Wong L.-P. Lomasney J.W. King K. J. Biol.

(Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). To perform the assay, 1 μg of enzyme was incubated with 200 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 150 μmphospholipid vesicle, and various concentrations of CaCl2to yield the indicated concentration of free calcium. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 15 min. The free and bound PLCδ1 were separated by sedimentation at 50,000 × g for 30 min. An equal proportion of the supernatant and pellet fractions were resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the amount of PLCδ1 in each fraction was estimated by Western blotting analysis. Calcium binding was determined by a nitrocellulose membrane binding assay similar to that described by Nakamura (25Nakamura J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 870: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and Kawasaki et al. (26Kawasaki H. Kasai H. Okuyama T. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 148: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 150 μmPS/PC or PA/PC phospholipid vesicles containing the indicated mole fractions of lipids were incubated with PLCδ1 (final concentration, 0.15 μm) in 100 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 10 μm EGTA containing 5–120 μm of 45CaCl2 (total cpm, 1.5 × 107) to yield the indicated concentration of free Ca2+. Millipore polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P transfer membrane was immersed in methanol and washed three times with 10 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, and 10 mm EGTA. The membrane was mounted on a 96-well Bio-Dot filtration apparatus according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). After incubating at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was filtered through the membrane at a constant flow rate of 0.6–1 ml/min. Each well was washed six times with 100 μl of ice-cold 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 10 mmEGTA. The membrane was cut into sections corresponding to each sample, and the retention of 45Ca2+ on the membrane was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The amount of45Ca2+ bound to the enzyme was determined in the presence or absence of vesicles containing the indicated composition of phospholipids. Calcium binding to phospholipid vesicles in the absence of enzyme was determined under the same experimental conditions. The amount of 45Ca2+ binding directly to phospholipid vesicles was relatively low but consistent with published apparent Kd values for Ca2+-PS interactions (27Nelsestuen G.L. Lim T.K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4164-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 28Portis A. Newton C. Pangborn W. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 780-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The calcium bound to membranes or to phospholipid vesicles was considered nonspecific binding and was subtracted from the amount of Ca2+ bound by samples containing protein plus phospholipid. PIP2hydrolysis in dodecyl maltoside/PIP2 mixed micelles was performed in a manner similar to that described by Cifuentes et al. (9Cifuentes M.E. Honkanen L. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11586-11593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. In brief, the indicated amount of PIP2/[3H]PIP2 (4 × 105 cpm) in chloroform/methanol (19:1) in the presence or absence of the indicated phospholipids was dried under a stream of N2 and lyophilized for 30 min. Lipids were solubilized by probe sonication in 0.95 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA plus the indicated concentration of dodecyl maltoside. Bovine serum albumin in the same buffer was added to 500 μg/ml. PLC activity was determined as a function of the concentration of substrate by keeping the total concentration of nonsubstrate phospholipid plus dodecyl maltoside at 500 μm and varying the mole fraction of PIP2. The reaction at 30 °C was initiated by adding various concentration of CaCl2 to yield the indicated concentration of free calcium. The reaction was continued for 1–5 min and was stopped by adding 0.34 ml of 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid and 0.17 ml of bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml). After incubation on ice for 15 min, the unhydrolyzed [3H]PIP2 (pellet) was separated from [3H]IP3 (supernatant) by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Surface dilution kinetics were employed to study PIP2 hydrolysis catalyzed by PLCδ1. Case III conditions previously described for phospholipase A2 (29Hendrickson H.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5734-5739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PLCβ (30James S.R. Paterson A. Harden T.K. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11872-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were employed. In Case III conditions, the total concentration of diluent detergent (dodecyl maltoside plus nonsubstrate phospholipid) was fixed, and the PLC activity was measured with increasing concentrations of substrate. A dual phospholipid binding model of catalysis (Equations 1 and 2) (29Hendrickson H.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5734-5739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to analyze the kinetic data.E+S⇌k−1k+1ESEquation 1 ES+S⇌k−2k+2ESS→k3ES+PEquation 2 This model takes into account the fact that the reaction catalyzed by PLCδ1 occurs at the water-lipid interface of the phosphoinositide/dodecyl maltoside mixed micelle. Initial binding of the enzyme to the water-lipid interface of the micelle is described by the micellar dissociation constant, Ks =k−1 /k+1 (molar unit). This constant is dependent on both the total enzyme concentration and the total substrate. The binding of the second lipid molecule and the subsequent catalysis by PLCδ1 is described by the interfacial Michaelis constant, Km =(k−2 + k3 )/k+2 (mole fraction, unitless). Initial rates of catalysis (v) as a function of total concentration of PIP2 in the vesicle with a fixed concentration of diluent nonsubstrate phospholipids and dodecylmaltoside (To) were fitted using Equation 3(29Hendrickson H.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5734-5739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to obtain the values of Vmax,Ks, and Km.v=VmaxSo2KmKsTo+(To+Ks)KmSo+(Km+1)So2Equation 3 where the absolute rate (Vmax) occurs at an infinite substrate concentration and the saturated substrate mole fraction (So) is the total substrate concentration. The concentration of free Ca2+ and nonsubstrate phospholipids can greatly influence the activity of PLCδ1. As shown in Fig. 1A, anionic phospholipids such as PS and PA stimulated PLCδ1 hydrolysis of PIP2 by a factor of 20 and 4, respectively, whereas cationic phospholipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine and PC had no effect or were inhibitory. Although PS and PA are both anionic phospholipids, PS stimulation was much greater than that of PA. As shown in Fig. 1B, the maximal stimulation of PLCδ1 activity by PS (12 μmol/min/mg) was at least 5-fold higher than that by PA (2.3 μmol/min/mg). The concentration (mol %) of PA for half-maximal stimulation of PLCδ1 is lower than that of PS. This analysis revealed that the affinity of PLCδ1 appears to be greater for PA than for PS, whereas the maximal stimulation of PLCδ1 activity by PS is much greater than that by PA. Because Ca2+ participates directly in the PLCδ1 catalyzed hydrolysis of PIP2, we also examined the effect of PS concentration on the Ca2+ dependence of PLCδ1 activity. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the concentration of Ca2+ required for half-maximal stimulation in 25 mol % PS mixed micelles was 0.45 μm, whereas it was greater than 5 μm in PS-free micelles. This result demonstrated that PS significantly increases the potency for Ca2+ activation of PLCδ1. PS could activate PLCδ1 by interacting with the enzyme directly or through nonspecific mechanisms. To distinguish between these possibilities, centrifugation binding experiments were performed with vesicles to examine the interaction between PLCδ1 and PS. Fig. 3 shows that PLCδ1 accumulates in the pellet fraction, a consequence of direct binding of PLCδ1 to the sucrose-loaded PS/PC vesicles. Furthermore, this binding was dependent on Ca2+. In the absence of free Ca2+, very little PLCδ1 bound to the PS/PC vesicles. PLCδ1 binding to PS/PC vesicles increased as the concentration of free Ca2+increased, reaching saturation (100% of PLCδ1 in the pellet) at 50 μm free Ca2+. It is the PS that is essential for PLCδ1 to bind to the PS/PC phospholipid vesicles. No binding of PLCδ1 was detected in vesicles devoid of PS. As the concentration of PS increased (Fig. 4a), more PLCδ1 bound to the vesicle; saturation of PLCδ1 binding occurred at a concentration of 35 mol % PS. The concentration of PS required in the mixed micelles for half-maximal binding was estimated to be 15 mol %. The binding of phospholipid vesicles by PLCδ1 was remarkably specific for PS; in contrast, only a small amount of PLCδ1 bound to PA/PC vesicles (Fig. 4b). A nitrocellulose filter Ca2+ protein binding assay was used to investigate the role of Ca2+ in regulating the binding of phospholipid to PLCδ1. In the absence of PLCδ1, 45Ca2+ was poorly retained on the nitrocellulose membrane (Fig. 5A). Even the binding between 0.15 μm PLCδ1 and 40 μm free45Ca2+ (1.5 × 107 cpm) was barely detectable (7,000–10,000 cpm). However, the binding of45Ca2+ to PLCδ1 was significantly increased by including PS/PC but not PA/PC vesicles in the binding mixture. As shown in Fig. 5A, as much as 1% (150,000 cpm) of the total45Ca2+ was bound to PLCδ1 when 150 μm of PS/PC (mole ratio, 1:1) vesicles were co-incubated with 0.15 μm PLCδ1 and 40 μm of free Ca2+. Binding of Ca2+ to PLCδ1 specifically required PS, because the binding was minimal with PA/PC phospholipid vesicles. PS stimulated PLCδ1-Ca2+ binding in a dose-dependent and saturable manner. As shown in Fig. 5B, Ca2+ binding by PLCδ1 was significantly stimulated by as low as 5 mol % PS, and the binding plateaued at 40 mol % PS. The concentration of PS required for half-maximal Ca2+ binding under these conditions was estimated to be 10 mol %. In contrast, stimulation of Ca2+-PLCδ1 binding by PA/PC vesicles was minimal. The maximal PA-dependent Ca2+ binding by PLCδ1 was lower than that of PS and occurred at 10 mol % PA; no further stimulation of binding was observed even if the concentration of PA was increased to 75 mol %. This result demonstrates the specificity for the head group of PS required for PLCδ to bind Ca2+. To understand how PS facilitates Ca2+ binding to PLCδ1, the effect of PS on the dose dependence of Ca2+ binding to PLCδ1 was examined. 45Ca2+ bound to PLCδ1 in a dose-dependent and saturable manner when the binding was carried out in the presence of phospholipid vesicles containing PS. As shown in Fig. 6, in the presence of PS/PC vesicles containing 35 mol % PS the maximal binding of Ca2+ to 0.15 μm PLCδ1 was 35 pmol, which corresponds to approximately 2.3 pmol Ca2+/pmol protein. The concentration of Ca2+ required for half-maximal binding was estimated to be 7 μm. In the presence of vesicles containing 10% PS, the total binding at 1 mmCa2+ was reduced to 23 pmol, corresponding to 1.4 pmol Ca2+/pmol protein. With vesicles containing 2.5 mol % PS, saturation of Ca2+ binding was not reached, even at a free Ca2+ concentration of 1 mm. These results demonstrate that PS specifically increases the affinity of Ca2+ for PLCδ1. Two structure features in PLCδ1 have been shown to be involved in divalent metal ion binding, the cleavage center and the C2 domain near the C terminus of the enzyme. To determine whether PS-dependent Ca2+ binding is mediated by these structural determinants, we examined the Ca2+binding activity of a cleavage center double point mutant (E341G,E390G) and a C2 domain loop deletion mutant (Δ646–654). The double mutant enzyme E341G,E390G is completely defective in catalysis (TableI), presumably because of the loss of Ca2+ binding at the cleavage center. In contrast, C2 loop deletion Δ646–654 mutant catalyzes the hydrolysis of PI and PIP2 in a manner comparable with that of the native enzyme (Table I).Table IPI and PIP2 hydrolysis activity of native and mutant PLCδ1Type of enzymesEnzymatic activityPIaPIP2 and PI hydrolysis activities were determined as described (20), expressed as release of μmol of IP3 or IP/min/mg of enzyme.PIP2aPIP2 and PI hydrolysis activities were determined as described (20), expressed as release of μmol of IP3 or IP/min/mg of enzyme.μmol/min/mgNative PLCδ162 ± 535 ± 3E341G, E390G<0.1<0.1Δ646–65461 ± 433 ± 4a PIP2 and PI hydrolysis activities were determined as described (20Cheng H.-F.

Open table in a new tab The E341G,E390G mutant PLCδ1, although defective in cleavage activity, was able to bind Ca2+ in a PS-dependent manner indistinguishable from the native enzyme (Fig. 7A), and the binding also displayed Ca2+ dependence similar to that of the native enzyme (Fig. 7B). Although the Δ646–654 deletion mutant is as active as the native enzyme in catalyzing the hydrolysis of PI or PIP2, this mutant was severely defective in PS-dependent Ca2+ binding. The Δ646–654 deletion mutant enzyme bound Ca2+ poorly, even at saturating concentrations of either PS or free Ca2+(Fig. 7, A and B). These results identify the C2 domain as the structural motif responsible for mediating PS-dependent Ca2+ binding. To study whether the Δ646–654 mutant is also defective in PS mediated stimulation, we examined the effect of PS on the Ca2+-dependent catalysis of substrate. In the absence of PS, the Δ646–654 mutant catalyzed the hydrolysis of PIP2 with a similar Ca2+ dependence as the native enzyme (Fig. 8). In contrast, in the presence of 25 mol % PS, the activity of the Δ646–654 mutant is at least lower than that of the native enzyme by a factor of 3 (Fig. 8). This result illustrates that residues 646–654 are not essential for the basal activity of PLCδ1 but are required for PS-dependent enzyme activation. The Δ646–654 mutant is also impaired in its ability to bind PS. Although E341G,E390G was able to bind a PS vesicle in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Fig. 9a), the Δ646–654 mutant was severely defective in Ca2+-dependent PS binding (Fig. 9b). This finding revealed that residues 646–654 in the C2 domain of PLCδ1 are also involved in PS binding. PS stimulation of PIP2 hydrolysis in the mixed micelles could be because of an increase in the maximal turnover of the enzyme, an increase in affinity for the substrate, or an increase in affinity of the enzyme for the membrane. To distinguish between these possibilities or a combination thereof, the effects of PS concentration in the mixed micelles on the substrate dependence of PLCδ1 catalysis was examined. The rate of hydrolysis of PIP2 in mixed micelles containing either 0, 2.5, or 35 mol % PS was compared as a function of the total PIP2 concentration (from 0.5 to 50 μm, corresponding to a molar fraction from 0.1 to 9 mol %). When the concentration of PIP2 was increased from 0.1 to 9%, the hydrolysis of PIP2 in mixed micelles containing 25 mol % PS sharply increased from 3 to 18 μmol/min/mg and was saturated as the PIP2 concentration approached 4 mol % (Fig. 10). PIP2 hydrolysis in PS-free mixed micelles increased slowly and did not reach a maximum even at a 9 mol % PIP2 (Fig. 10). The most dramatic stimulatory effect of PS on the hydrolysis of PIP2 was found at a low substrate concentration. As shown in Fig. 10, when PIP2 concentration was less than 2 mol %, PIP2hydrolysis in mixed micelles containing 25 mol % PS was at least 10-fold higher than in PS-free mixed micelles. The stimulatory effect of PS diminished as the concentration of PIP2 increased (Fig. 10). The kinetic parameters of PLCδ1 (TableII) demonstrate that the stimulation of PIP2 hydrolysis by PS was primarily because of a reduction in the interfacial Michaelis constant (Km), which governs the affinity between the catalytic site and the substrate. TheKm was reduced by a factor of 20, from 0.065 to 0.003, as PS in the mixed micelles was increased from 0 to 25 mol %. In contrast, PS had little effect on the affinity of the enzyme for the membrane (Ks) and its maximal rate of catalysis (Vmax).Table IIEffect of PS on the kinetic properties of PLCδ1PS concentration (mol %)Vmax (μmol/min/mg)Km (mol fraction)Ks (μm)016 ± 30.065 ± 0.0171 ± 81018 ± 30.012 ± 0.0361 ± 82519 ± 40.003 ± 0.00143 ± 7Hydrolysis of increasing concentration of PIP2 by PLCδ1 was measured in PIP2/dodecyl maltoside mixed micelles containing 25, 10, and 0 mol % PS (see “Experimental Procedures”).Vmax, Km, and Ks correspond to the constants defined in the surface dilution model (Equations 1, 2, and 3); values ofVmax, Km, and Ks were calculated by fitting the data to Equation 3(29Hendrickson H.S.

In this report we examine in detail the effects of nonsubstrate phospholipids on PLCδ1 activity and the molecular mechanism of their interaction. Although both PA and PS stimulate PLCδ1, the mechanism of stimulation may be different for PA and PS. They differ in affinity and maximal stimulation of PLCδ1. A direct interaction between PLCδ1 and PS but not PA was demonstrated by the binding assay. Furthermore, Ca2+ binding to PLCδ1 requires PS not PA. These observations suggested that there is a specific interaction between PS and PLCδ1. The similar effect of PS on enzyme stimulation has also been demonstrated for protein kinase C (31Lee M.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14797-14805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Newton A.C. Keranen L.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although both C2 domain and cleavage center could be the Ca2+ binding site, the present data show that PS-dependent Ca2+ binding occurs at the C2 domain of PLCδ1. In the presence of saturation level of PS but no substrate, the maximal binding of Ca2+ to PLCδ1 was measured to be 2.1 pmol Ca2+/pmol protein. The concentration of Ca2+ required for half-maximal binding was estimated to be 7 μm. This stoichiometry is in good agreement with other studies indicating that a total of three to five metal ions bind to a single molecule of PLCδ1 (3Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). One site exists in the catalytic domain where a single calcium ion binds and is required for catalysis (3Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Substrate facilitates calcium binding at this site. A second site exists in the C2 domain, where four putative metal ion binding sites are present. Two of these sites have been shown to bind calcium ions in structural studies, and three can be occupied by lanthanum (12Essen L.O. Perisic O. Lynch D.E. Katan M. Williams R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2753-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The actual number of calciums binding to the C2 domain of PLCδ1 is unknown. Because calcium analogs such as lanthanum may actually have greater affinity for true calcium binding sites, three calcium binding sites could well be an overestimate. The present studies indicate a minimum of two calciums binding to the C2 domain. Residues 646–654 constitute the C terminus of the loop that connects β1 and β2 strands in the C2 domain of PLCδ1 (3Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The phenotype of the Δ646–654 deletion mutant revealed that this region of C2 domain is required for PLCδ1 to interact with PS and Ca2+. This finding is consistent with the role of the C2 domain in other molecules. The C2 domains of cytosolic phospholipase A2, synaptotagmin I, and protein kinase C all mediate calcium-dependent phospholipid binding (33Clark J.D. Lin L.L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A.

Our data indicated that abolishing Ca2+ binding to the C2 domain did not affect the basal activity of PLCδ1. This is consistent with the findings of Grobler and Hurley (36Grobler J.A. Hurley J.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5020-5028Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which show that deleting similar loop in PLCδ1 does not affect its catalysis of PIP2 hydrolysis in PC vesicles. However, this loop is required for the enzyme to interact with and is stimulated by PS, because Δ646–654 mutant enzyme was much less active than the native enzyme when catalysis was performed in the presence of PS. Although the loop connecting β1 and β2 strand in the C2 domain is required for PS mediated activation and Ca2+ binding of PLCδ1, other residues in the C2 domain were mapped and found essential for PS to bind and stimulate PLCδ1. 2J. W. Lomasney, H.-F. Cheng, S. R. Roffler, and K. King, manuscript in preparation. The relationship between calcium, PS, and PLCδ1 appears to be very complex because all three are interdependent. While calcium regulates PS binding, PS also regulates calcium binding to PLCδ1. PS increases the potency for free calcium on the activation of PLCδ1. PS facilitates the binding of calcium to PLCδ1 by increasing the affinity. In the absence of PS, very little calcium binds to PLCδ1. PA has no effect on calcium binding correlating with its weak ability to activate PLCδ1. Furthermore, deleting residues 646–654 not only abolished Ca2+ binding but also eliminated the activation and binding of PLCδ1 by PS. All these observations indicated that the simultaneous presence of Ca2+, PLCδ1, and PS stabilizes a ternary complex formed by these three components. The predominant effect of PS on the stimulation of PLCδ1 is to reduce the interfacial Michaelis constant (Km) (increasing the substrate affinity for the catalytic site). TheKm was reduced by a factor of 20. A similar result was also found for protein kinase C; a decrease inKm results when rat brain enzyme binds PS and Ca2+ (37Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2962-2972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PS has also been found to increase the affinity between coagulation factor IXa and VIIIa and to reduce theKm for the factor IXa catalyzed proteolysis reaction (38Gilbert G.E. Arena A.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10768-10776Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Both Ks (which governs the affinity of the enzyme for membrane) and Vmax (which reflects the velocity at infinite substrate concentrations) were not affected by the presence of PS. The present kinetic analysis may not have been sensitive enough to detect the contribution of PS on membrane anchorage (Ks), because membrane association may be primarily driven by PIP2 binding to the PH domain. The binding of PIP2 to the PH domain is at least 10-fold tighter than that for the Ca2+-dependent binding of PS by the enzyme (5Lomasney J.W. Cheng H.-F. Wang L.-P. Kuan Y.-S. Liu S.-M. Fesik S.W. King K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25316-25326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Although two distinct mechanisms have been proposed by isolated reports (39Feng J.-F. Rhee S.G. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16451-16454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 40Homma Y. Emori Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), the binding of calcium and PS to the C2 domain may also be an important mechanism for regulation of this enzyme in vivo. Our data demonstrated that in the absence of PS, PLCδ1 is relatively inactive to catalyze the hydrolysis of physiological concentrations of PIP2 (<1 mol % of total membrane phospholipids). However, PS and calcium stimulate PLCδ1 at physiological concentration of PIP2 by increasing the affinity for the substrate. The concentration of PS (41Calderone A. Oster L. Moreau P. Rouleau J.L. Stewart D.J. Dechamplain J. Hypertension. 1994; 23: 722-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Ca2+ required to stimulate PLCδ1 are within limits of their intracellular concentrations. The intracellular concentration of calcium is usually below 1 μm; however, the local calcium can rise to almost mm levels after stimulation by various calcium mobilizing agonists. We suggest that the formation of a stimulatory ternary complex is a mechanism by which calcium can regulate this isoform. If we assume that the mol % of PS is relatively constant in the plasma membranes of cells, then calcium becomes the primary modulator of PLCδ1 activity. Of course, this fits into a well established and broad paradigm in which fluxes of calcium are modulators of protein function and cellular effects. In summary, the present results show that the formation of an enzyme-PS-calcium ternary complex through the C2 domain increases its affinity for substrate and consequently stimulates the enzyme. We postulate that the formation of this ternary complex plays a role in the in vivo activation and regulation of PLCδ1. We thanks Dr. Y.-S. Lin and Dr. S.-F. Wang for critical discussions and reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2043394651,"We report here the identification and characterization of human and mouse PECI, a novel gene that encodes a monofunctional peroxisomal Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase. Human and mousePECI were identified on the basis of their sequence similarity to Eci1p, a recently characterized peroxisomal Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase from the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Cloning and sequencing of the human PECI cDNA revealed the presence of a 1077-base pair open reading frame predicted to encode a 359-amino acid protein with a mass of 39.6 kDa. The corresponding mouse cDNA contains a 1074-base pair open reading frame that encodes a 358-amino acid-long protein with a deduced mass of 39.4 kDa. Northern blot analysis demonstrated human PECI mRNA is expressed in all tissues. A bacterially expressed form of human PECI catalyzed the isomerization of 3-cis-octenoyl-CoA to 2-trans-octenoyl-CoA with a specific activity of 27 units/mg of protein. The human and mouse PECI proteins contain type-1 peroxisomal targeting signals, and human PECI was localized to peroxisomes by both subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy techniques. The potential roles for this monofunctional Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase in peroxisomal metabolism are discussed. We report here the identification and characterization of human and mouse PECI, a novel gene that encodes a monofunctional peroxisomal Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase. Human and mousePECI were identified on the basis of their sequence similarity to Eci1p, a recently characterized peroxisomal Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase from the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Cloning and sequencing of the human PECI cDNA revealed the presence of a 1077-base pair open reading frame predicted to encode a 359-amino acid protein with a mass of 39.6 kDa. The corresponding mouse cDNA contains a 1074-base pair open reading frame that encodes a 358-amino acid-long protein with a deduced mass of 39.4 kDa.

The utilization of fatty acids as an energy source is characteristic of nearly all free-living organisms. The series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions required to degrade fatty acids is evolutionarily conserved and is accomplished primarily through the pathway of β-oxidation. In lower eukaryotes such as yeasts and plants, β-oxidation is localized exclusively to the peroxisome (1Veenhuis M. Mateblowski M. Kunau W.-H. Harder W. Yeast. 1987; 3: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar,2Kunau W.-H. Buhne S. de la Garza M. Kionka C. Mateblowski M. Schulz-Borchard U. Thieringer R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1988; 16: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Studies of the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiaehave demonstrated that three genes encode the four core enzymes of the β-oxidation pathway. This pathway proceeds sequentially through (i) the oxidation of a fatty acyl-CoA to a 2-enoyl-CoA in a reaction catalyzed by acyl-CoA oxidase (Pox1p) (3Dmochowska A. Dignard D. Maleszka R. Thomas D.Y. Gene. 1990; 88: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), (ii) the hydration of the 2-enoyl-CoA to a d-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, (iii) the subsequent dehydrogenation of this intermediate to a 3-ketoacyl-CoA in reactions catalyzed by the bifunctional 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase/d-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase enzyme (Fox2p) (4Hiltunen J.K. Wenzel B. Beyer A. Erdmann R. Fossa A. Kunau W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6646-6653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and (iv) the cleavage of the 3-ketoacyl-CoA by thiolase (Pot1p) (5Einerhand A.W. Voorn-Brouwer T.M. Erdmann R. Kunau W.-H. Tabak H.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) to acetyl-CoA and a fatty acyl-CoA shortened by two carbon units. Although these enzymes are necessary for all fatty acid β-oxidation, the complete metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids requires one or more additional auxiliary enzymes (6Kunau W.-H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). These include Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (Eci1p) (7Geisbrecht B.V. Zhu D. Schulz K. Nau K. Morrell J.C.

Among these auxiliary enzymes, Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (Eci1p) is unique in that its activity is essential for the β-oxidation of all unsaturated fatty acids (Fig. 1). In mammals, fatty acid β-oxidation is considerably more complex than in yeast, primarily due to the existence of overlapping but distinct fatty acid β-oxidation pathways. These include separate, complete fatty acid oxidation systems in both mitochondria and peroxisomes, as well as substrate specific sets of enzymes in each organelle. For instance, mammalian peroxisomes contain at least three fatty acyl-CoA oxidases (12Hashimoto T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Mannaerts G. van Veldhoven P. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

The Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase activity of mammalian peroxisomes has been ascribed previously to MFE1, thel-specific 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase multifunctional enzyme (14Palosaari P.M. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2446-2449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we and others have recently identified and characterized the S. cerevisiaeΔ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (7Geisbrecht B.V. Zhu D. Schulz K. Nau K. Morrell J.C. Geraghty M. Schulz H. Erdmann R.

In this report we describe the identification and characterization of a novel, ubiquitously expressed mammalian peroxisomal Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (PECI) that is homologous to yeast Eci1p. Human and mouse cDNAs forPECI were cloned, the human protein was found to have significant Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase activity, and the human PECI was localized to the peroxisome matrix by biochemical and immunofluorescence techniques. A cDNA clone (GenBankTM accession number AA188052) encoding a candidate human homolog (human PECI) of yeast Eci1p was obtained from Genome Systems, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). The 5′-untranslated region of the human PECI cDNA was extended by 5′-directed rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) 1The abbreviations used are: RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; ORF, open reading frame; MBP, maltose-binding protein. polymerase chain reaction using a human fetal liver Marathon RACE cDNA (CLONTECH). The oligonucleotide 5′-ATATAGCGCGTAGAGTTTTAGCTTCACTTCGTTTCCTGG-3′ was used as a humanPECI cDNA-specific primer, and all 5′-RACE reactions were performed in the presence of 6% Me2SO according to the manufacturer's suggestions. A cDNA clone (GenBankTM accession number AA030780) encoding a candidate mouse homolog (mouse PECI) of Eci1p was identified by essentially the same strategy as was the human cDNA, and this clone was obtained from Genome Systems, Inc. Two forms of the human PECI open reading frame (ORF) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the AA188052 plasmid as a template. The complete ORF was amplified using the oligonucleotides 5′-AAAGTCGACAATGAGAGCCAGTCAGAAGGACTTTG-3′ and 5′-TTTGCGGCCGCTCATCACAGTTTTGATTTTCTGGATAAGAA-3′. A form of human PECI lacking the final three codons of the ORF (PECIΔSKL) was amplified by using the oligonucleotide 5′-TTTGCGGCCGCTCATTTTCTGGATAAGAAGTTCACCAC-3′. Both sets of oligonucleotides append SalI and NotI sites (underlined sequences) at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the PECIORF. All polymerase chain reactions were performed with a low error-rate mixture of polymerases (Expand, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The polymerase chain reaction product from each reaction was digested with SalI and NotI and subcloned into the SalI and NotI sites of pMBP (7Geisbrecht B.V. Zhu D. Schulz K. Nau K. Morrell J.C.

The sequence of each form of the human PECI ORF in pMBP was confirmed by automated fluorescent sequencing, and the resulting plasmids were denoted pMBP-PECI and pMBP-PECIΔSKL. TheSalI-NotI fragment of pMBP-PECI was excised and transferred to the plasmid pT7His. This plasmid is a modified form of pET28a (Novagen, Inc.) and contains additional XhoI and SalI sites in place of theNheI-HindIII fragment from the parental vector. The resulting plasmid, pT7His-PECI, allows for T7 polymerase-driven expression of an N-terminal His6-PECI fusion protein. TheSalI-NotI fragment of pMBP-PECI was also excised and transferred to the vector pT7, a modified version of pET28a that lacks sequences encoding the hexahistidinyl tag and instead containsXhoI, SalI, and NotI sites immediately downstream of the initiating ATG codon. The resulting plasmid, pT7-PECI, allows for the in vitro transcription and translation of unmodified PECI. For routine manipulations of cDNAs and plasmids, the Escherichia coli strain DH10B was used (17Grant S.G. Jessee J. Bloom F.R. Hanahan D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4645-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). DH10B cells were also used for the expression of all maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins. For T7 polymerase-driven expression of recombinant proteins, the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was chosen (Novagen, Inc.). All media for bacterial culture have been described (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Human multi-tissue Northern blots were obtained from CLONTECH. Probes were generated by random primed labeling of PECI cDNA fragments in the presence of [α-32P]dATP using the Prime It kit (Stratagene, Inc.). Hybridizations and washing were carried out according to standard protocols (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The Clustal algorithm and PAM250 substitution matrix were used in conjunction with DNASTAR (Madison, WI) software to perform all sequence alignments. The plasmids pMBP-PECI and pMBP-PECIΔSKL are designed to express the human PECI and human PECIΔSKL proteins, respectively, in fusion with E. coli MBP. Induction of protein expression, cell growth and lysis, and amylose-affinity chromatography methods have been described in a previous report (7Geisbrecht B.V. Zhu D. Schulz K. Nau K. Morrell J.C.

For expression of His6-PECI, freshly transformed BL21(DE3) cells harboring the pT7His-PECI plasmid were grown at 30 °C with vigorous shaking (275 rpm) for 12–14 h in 50 ml of LB media supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate and sterile dextrose to 1%. After this incubation period, 7.5 ml of cell suspension from the preculture were diluted into 500 ml of 2YT media containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate and sterile dextrose to 0.2%. This culture was grown with vigorous shaking at 18 °C until the A600reached 0.5, at which time induction of protein expression was begun by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Following growth of the induced culture for 18 h, cells were harvested and a cleared, soluble protein lysate was prepared as described previously (7Geisbrecht B.V. Zhu D. Schulz K. Nau K.

The His6-PECI present in the soluble protein lysate was purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA agarose (ProBond; Invitrogen, Inc.). Briefly, the soluble protein lysate was to diluted to a final volume of 200 ml in Column Buffer A and was applied at 2 ml/min to a 5 ml bed of ProBond agarose (prepared according to the manufacturer's suggestions) at 4 °C. The bed was washed with 5 volumes of Buffer A and then with 20 volumes of Buffer B (20 mm sodium-Pi (pH 6.0), 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Following these washing steps, the His6-PECI was eluted from the bed using an imidazole step gradient in Buffer B. One column volume each of buffers containing 50, 250, 350, and 500 mmimidazole was applied sequentially to the resin bed, the eluants were collected, and each fraction was assayed for the presence of His6-PECI by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (observed Mr ≅ 42,000). Fractions containing highly purified (>90% by Coomassie stain) His6-PECI were pooled, and the His6-PECI present was precipitated slowly by the addition of solid ammonium sulfate to 0.4 g/ml. The His6-PECI precipitate was collected from this suspension and then stored at −70 °C until use. Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase activity using 3-cis-octenoyl-CoA as a substrate was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm according to the coupled assay originally described by Binstock and Schulz (19Binstock J.F. Schulz H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). One unit of Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to catalyze the isomerization of 1 μmol of 3-cis-octenoyl-CoA to 2-trans-octenoyl-CoA in 1 min under standard assay conditions. Measurements of 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase activity (using crotonyl-CoA) and Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase activity (using 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA) were performed essentially as described (20Shoukry K.

Total protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a reference. The plasmid pT7-PECI contains a T7 promoter 5′ of the PECI cDNA and was used as a template for in vitrotranscription and translation reactions. Reactions were carried out on a 25-μl scale using the T7-coupled TnT system (Promega, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Total cellular protein lysates were prepared from human skin fibroblasts (cell line GM5756) as described previously (24Dodt G. Gould S.J. J.

The normal human fibroblast cell line GM5756 was purchased from the Coriell Cell Repository (Vineland, NJ). The pex10-deficient cell line PBD100 has been described and was a gift from A. Moser and H. Moser (The Kennedy-Krieger Institute, Baltimore, MD) (26Warren D.S. Morrell J.C. Moser H.W. Valle D. Gould S.J. Am. J. Hum.

The tissue culture supernatant from mouse hybridoma line 1–9E10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was the source of the monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody. The Binding Site (San Diego, CA) was the source of affinity-purified sheep antibodies recognizing human catalase. Affinity-purified fluorescein-anti-mouse, fluorescein-anti-sheep, and Texas red-anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were obtained from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD) and were used according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Guinea pig polyclonal anti-PMP70 antibodies were raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 18 amino acids of human PMP70 (26Warren D.S. Morrell J.C. Moser H.W. Valle D.

Bacterially expressed MBP-PECIΔSKL was used to elicit the production of polyclonal anti-PECI antibodies in New Zealand White rabbits. Rabbits were purchased from, maintained at, and immunized according to the standard protocols of Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. (Reamstown, PA). Anti-PECI antibodies were purified on an antigen column consisting of purified MBP-PECIΔSKL that was chemically coupled to a support of cyanogen bromide Sepharose (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Specifically, 3 ml of anti-PECI immune sera were diluted to 30 ml in phosphate buffered saline (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). This sample was applied to a 300-μl bed of MBP-PECIΔSKL-Sepharose equilibrated in the same buffer at 18 °C. Binding, washing, elution, and storage of purified antibodies was as described (27Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed as described in Crane et al. (28Crane D.I. Kalish J.E. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21835-21844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of a postnuclear supernatant from HepG2 cells and fractionation of this supernatant by ultracentrifugation on a 15–42% linear Nycodenz density gradient has been described (29Dodt G. Braverman N. Wong C. Moser A. Moser H.W. Watkins P. Valle D. Gould S.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Following ultracentrifugation fractions (750 μl) were drawn from the bottom of the gradient and assayed for a peroxisomal marker enzyme, catalase, and for a mitochondrial marker enzyme, succinate dehydrogenase. Immediately following these assays, the proteins present in each fraction were precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 15%. The precipitated samples were prepared for 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting as described (28Crane D.I. Kalish J.E. Gould S.J. J. Biol.

We recently reported the identification and characterization of a peroxisomal Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase, Eci1p, from the yeast S. cerevisiae (7Geisbrecht B.V. Zhu D. Schulz K. Nau K. Morrell J.C. Geraghty M. Schulz H. Erdmann R. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33184-33191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This apparently monofunctional enzyme is the sole physiologically relevant source of Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase activity inS. cerevisiae and is required to completely oxidize unsaturated fatty acids (7Geisbrecht B.V.

Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 116-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Peroxisomes of mammalian cells also contain a Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase. Although this enzymatic activity has been attributed previously to the multifunctional enzyme (MFE1) that also catalyzes 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase and l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase reactions (14Palosaari P.M. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2446-2449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether mammalian peroxisomes might contain a protein similar to Eci1p. The BLAST algorithm was used to search the data base of expressed sequence tags (dbEST) for mammalian cDNAs capable of encoding a protein with significant similarity to Eci1p, the deduced product of the yeast ECI1 gene. Iterative searches identified a human endothelial cell cDNA (clone AA188052) with the potential of encoding such a protein. This cDNA (denotedPECI) was sequenced in its entirety and the sequence of the 5′-untranslated region was extended by 5′-RACE. The PECIcDNA was found to contain a 1077-base pair open reading frame and was predicted to encode a 39.6-kDa protein of 359 amino acids (Fig. 2). These searches likewise identified a mouse cDNA (MmPECI, clone AA030780) with the potential to encode a protein with significant homology to both Eci1p and human PECI. The MmPECI cDNA was also sequenced in its entirety and was found to contain a 1074-base pair open reading frame. This open reading frame was predicted to encode a 358 amino acid polypeptide with a deduced molecular mass of 39.4 kDa (Fig. 3).Figure 3Identification of a mouse homolog of S. cerevisiae Eci1p. The nucleotide sequence of the mousePECI cDNA is depicted with the deduced translation of the 1074-base pair open reading frame contained therein. Note the presence of a TTG codon at cDNA position −15 (underlined) in contrast to the ATG found in this position of human PECI. In frame, upstream stop codons (underlined) are found at positions −139, −333, and −348. MmPECI is basic (pI = 8.42), has a molecular mass of 39.4 kDa, and terminates in the atypical type-1 peroxisomal targeting signal, Pro-Lys-Leu-COOH (underlined).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Almost all human tissues are capable of peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation. Northern blot analysis was used to determine whether the pattern of PECI expression was similarly broad. The 1.5-kilobase PECI mRNA was detected in all 16 human tissues examined (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the size of the PECI mRNA was consistent with the 1.3-kilobase size of the PECI cDNA and suggested that our cDNA may approach full length. PECI mRNA appeared to be most abundant in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver. An examination of the PECI cDNA sequence demonstrated the presence of two potential initiating ATG codons in the same reading frame (Fig. 2). This raised questions as to the authentic translation start site. Initiation of translation on mammalian mRNAs is favored when purines are present at the highest priority positions, namely +4 and −3 relative to the A of the ATG (32Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar, 33Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Examination of the second ATG revealed a match for this consensus. In contrast, the first ATG (position −15 in Fig. 2) has a poor consensus match for high efficiency initiation because a pyrimidine is found at position −3 relative to this ATG (denoted −18 in Fig. 2). Thus, the second ATG appears favored for translation initiation on the basis of the context. An independent line of evidence supporting the assignment of the second ATG as the translation start site in human PECI is derived from the MmPECI cDNA sequence in which the upstream ATG is absent (Fig. 3). A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of human and mouse PECI with yeast Eci1p revealed that these novel proteins share 22 and 19% identity to Eci1p, respectively (Fig. 5). The fact that both human and murine PECI are the most similar proteins in these species to Eci1p (the yeast peroxisomal Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase) suggested that they may also have Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase activity. To test this hypothesis, we expressed human PECI in E. coli with an N-terminal hexahistidinyl tag. Soluble His6-PECI was purified by affinity chromatography on a nickel agarose column and was assayed for Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase activity (Table I). We observed that recombinant PECI catalyzed the isomerization 3-cis-octenoyl-CoA to 2-trans-enoyl-CoA with a specific activity of 27 units/mg of protein. This level of activity is similar to values reported for the rat short-chain mitochondrial Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (38 units/mg) (34Palosaari P.M. Kilponen J.M. Sormunen R.T. Hassinen I.E. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3347-3353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for bacterially expressed Eci1p (12–16 units/mg) (7Geisbrecht B.V. Zhu D. Schulz K. Nau K.

We also assayed recombinant PECI for 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase and Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase activities (Table I) but were unable to detect these activities using crotonyl-CoA and 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA as the respective substrates.Table IEnzymatic activity of bacterially expressed PECIEnzymatic activitySpecific activityunits/mgEnoyl-CoA isomerase27Enoyl-CoA hydratase0Dienoyl-CoA isomerase0 Open table in a new tab Human and murine PECI contained putative type-1 peroxisomal targeting signals, Ser-Lys-Leu-COOH and Pro-Lys-Leu-COOH, respectively. In order to assess the subcellular localization of this enzyme, we first raised polyclonal antibodies to recombinant PECI (a truncated derivative lacking the last three residues was used to avoid raising antibodies to the type-1 peroxisomal targeting signal (35Gould S.J. Krisans S. Keller G.A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 36Shani N. Jimenez-Sanchez G. Steel G. Dean M. Valle D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1925-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)). Immunoblots of human fibroblast cell lysates demonstrated that immune sera detected a 39-kDa protein, whereas preimmune sera failed to detect this protein (Fig. 6). Affinity-purified anti-PECI antibodies were also tested against total human fibroblast protein as well as in vitro synthesized PECI that was encoded by thePECI cDNA clone. These experiments revealed that the affinity-purified anti-PECI antibodies specifically recognized a 39-kDa protein in whole cell extracts from fibroblasts and that this protein was indistinguishable in size from the product of the PECI cDNA (Fig. 6). To determine the subcellular distribution of endogenous PECI, a postnuclear supernatant from human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells was separated by ultracentrifugation on a linear Nycodenz density gradient. Fractions were assayed for enzyme markers of the peroxisome and the mitochondrion (Fig. 7A), as well as for PECI by immunoblot (Fig. 7B). PECI was localized predominantly to the peroxisomal fractions and appeared to leak from peroxisomes even less than catalase, the prototypical marker for peroxisomes. It should be noted that these experiments were performed with 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (a suboptimal resolving system for a protein of this size), which resulted in aberrant migration of PECI with the 35-kDa marker. We also examined the subcellular distribution of human PECI by immunofluorescence microscopy. A human skin fibroblast cell line was processed for double indirect immunofluorescence using affinity-purified rabbit anti-PECI antibodies and guinea pig anti-PMP70 antibodies that recognize the cytoplasmically exposed C-terminal tail of this integral peroxisomal membrane protein. PECI colocalized with PMP70 (Fig. 8, A and B) under conditions in which all cellular membranes were permeabilized, demonstrating that PECI is indeed a peroxisomal protein. However, when the same cells were processed so that only the plasma membrane was permeabilized (digitonin permeabilization (37Swinkels B.W. Gould S.J. Bodnar A.G. Rachubinski R.A. Subramani S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3255-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar)), the signal for PECI was lost, whereas the signal for PMP70 could still be detected (Fig. 8, C and D). This result was also observed for catalase, a well established marker of the peroxisome matrix (Fig. 8, E and F). Thus, PECI appeared to reside within the peroxisome lumen. As a final test of PECI localization, we examined its distribution in PBD100 cells, a human skin fibroblast cell line derived from a Zellweger syndrome patient. PBD100 is homozygous for inactivating mutations in the PEX10gene (26Warren D.S. Morrell J.C. Moser H.W. Valle D. Gould S.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), is unable to import peroxisomal matrix proteins, but does synthesize peroxisomes and import peroxisomal membrane proteins (26Warren D.S. Morrell J.C. Moser H.W. Valle D. Gould S.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As expected for a peroxisomal matrix protein, PECI accumulated in the cytosol of PBD100 cells (Fig. 8, G and H). Based on these results and those presented in Fig. 7, we conclude that PECI is a novel peroxisomal matrix enzyme. The activity of Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase is essential to completely oxidize unsaturated fatty acids, and its presence has been demonstrated in bacteria, yeast peroxisomes, mammalian peroxisomes, and mammalian mitochondria. We have reported here the identification of cDNAs encoding a novel, ubiquitously expressed monofunctional peroxisomal Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (PECI) of humans and mice. These genes were identified based on their potential to encode proteins homologous to Eci1p, the peroxisomal Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase of yeast. Human PECI was shown to have Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase activity of 27 units/mg, and the human form of PECI was localized to the peroxisomal matrix. A previous study of Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase in rat liver peroxisomes suggested that this activity was an integral feature of MFE1, the l-specific multifunctional enzyme that also catalyzes the second and third steps of the core β-oxidation spiral (14Palosaari P.M. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2446-2449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results raise the question as to why there are two proteins with the same apparent activity in the peroxisomal lumen. The occurrence of substrate-specific core enzymes in the peroxisome suggests that two forms of Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase might exist to metabolize distinct classes of 3-cis-enoyl-CoAs generated in the organelle. It is interesting to note that whereas MFE1 has been reported to function as a Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase, no evidence exists that describes such an activity of thed-specific multifunctional enzyme, MFE2. Furthermore, the multifunctional enzyme of yeast peroxisomes (Fox2p) is alsod-specific and lacks Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase activity (4Hiltunen J.K. Wenzel B. Beyer A. Erdmann R. Fossa A. Kunau W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6646-6653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it may be possible that the active site organization of thel-specific MFE hydratase domain confers Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase activity to this enzyme, a hypothesis originally proposed by Palossari et al.(38Palossari P.M. Vihinen M. Mantsala P.I. Alexson S.E. Pihlajaniemi T. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10750-10753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously characterized Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerases have been grouped into the hydratase/isomerase superfamily of acyl-CoA-binding proteins (31Hiltunen J.K. Filppula S.A. Koivuranta K.T. Siivari K.

Hayrinen H.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 116-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, yeast Eci1p and the mammalian PECI proteins lack this motif (7Geisbrecht B.V. Zhu D.

Furthermore, we find that these monofunctional peroxisomal Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerases contain a conserved NGPA(V/I)G(I/L)S motif that is absent from the previously described members of the hydratase/isomerase superfamily. When this eight-residue sequence is used to search the nonredundant data base of protein sequences, three additional polypeptides are identified. Among these are Yor180Cp, an S. cerevisiae protein with a role in fatty acid oxidation, 2Geisbrecht, B. V., Schulz, K., Nau, K., Geraghty, M. T., Schulz, H., Erdmann, R., and Gould, S. J. (1999)Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., in press. a putative PECI homolog of C. elegans, and a human testis-specific protein of unknown function, CDY (40Lahn B.T. Page D.C. Science. 1997; 278: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). These proteins appear to represent a previously unrecognized branch of the hydratase/isomerase superfamily and may lack the active site glutamate residue that has been proposed previously for these enzymes (31Hiltunen J.K. Filppula S.A. Koivuranta K.T. Siivari K. Qin Y.-M. Hayrinen H.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 116-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 39Muller-Newen G. Janssen U. Stoffel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the significance of these structural differences remain to be determined. The identification of mammalian forms of PECI expands our current understanding of the enzymology of peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation. In humans, it is clear that defects in peroxisomal fatty acid metabolism are associated with lethal inherited diseases (41Wanders R.J. Jansen G. van Roermund C.W. Denis S. Schutgens R.B. Jakobs B.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 450-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although defects in peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation are rare, four complementation groups of these disorders have been described (41Wanders R.J. Jansen G. van Roermund C.W. Denis S. Schutgens R.B. Jakobs B.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 450-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Two complementation groups correspond to defects in peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase and the D-specific multifunctional enzyme (41Wanders R.J. Jansen G. van Roermund C.W. Denis S. Schutgens R.B. Jakobs B.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 450-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), whereas the other two complementation groups are not defective in any of the known enzymes of fatty acid oxidation. 3R. J. A. Wanders, personal communication.Because Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase is essential for unsaturated fatty acid metabolism, human PECIshould be considered a candidate gene for these disorders.

Whereas the three plant proteins exhibit some structural similarities to known microbial homologs, they uniquely possess N-terminal polypeptide extensions that resemble typical chloroplast transit peptides. In vitro protein import assays with intact chloroplasts and immunolocalization experiments verify that higher plant lumazine synthase is synthesized in the cytosol as a larger molecular weight precursor protein, which is post-translationally imported into chloroplasts where it is proteolytically cleaved to its mature size. The authentic spinach enzyme is estimated to constitute <0.02% of the total chloroplast protein. Recombinant “mature” spinach lumazine synthase is expressed in E. coli at levels exceeding 30% of the total soluble protein and is readily purified to homogeneity using a simple two-step procedure. ApparentVmax and Km values obtained with the purified plant protein are similar to those reported for microbial lumazine synthases. Electron microscopy and hydrodynamic studies reveal that native plant lumazine synthase is a hollow capsid-like structure comprised of 60 identical 16.5-kDa subunits, resembling its icosahedral counterparts in E. coli and Bacillus subtilis.

Riboflavin, vitamin B2, is the precursor of flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide, essential cofactors for a multitude of mainstream metabolic enzymes that mediate hydride, oxygen, and electron transfer reactions. Consequently, critical cellular processes as diverse as the citric acid cycle, fatty acid oxidation, photosynthesis, mitochondrial electron transport, and de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis are fundamentally dependent on riboflavin availability. Despite its essentiality, however, only plants and certain microorganisms can synthesize vitamin B2, whereas higher animals, including man, must obtain it through their diet. In contrast, flavokinase and FAD pyrophosphorylase, the enzymes that convert riboflavin to FMN and FAD, respectively, are widely distributed in nature. Our current knowledge of riboflavin biosynthesis is largely restricted to bacteria and yeast (reviewed in Ref. 1Bacher A. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoproteins. 1. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 215-259Google Scholar). In both cases, the synthetic pathway consists of seven distinct enzyme-catalyzed reactions, with GTP and ribulose 5-phosphate the ultimate, noncommitted precursors. Although the sequence of events that are catalyzed in the second and third steps occur in opposite order in bacteria and fungi, the remaining pathway intermediates are identical in both types of microorganisms. The last two enzymes of riboflavin biosynthesis, lumazine synthase (LS) 1The abbreviations used are: LS, lumazine synthase (6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase); RS, riboflavin synthase; DHBP, 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate; ARAPD, 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione; DMRL, 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine; GTP-CHII, GTP-cyclohydrolase II; DHBPS, 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; nt, nucleotide(s). and riboflavin synthase (RS), are the best characterized, both structurally and mechanistically. In Bacillus subtilis, these proteins physically interact with each other to form a huge spherical particle with a combined molecular mass of ∼1 MDa (2Bacher A. Baur R. Eggers U. Harders H. Otto M.K. Schnepple H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 632-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the x-ray structure of this complex has been determined at 3.3 Å (3Ladenstein R. Schneider M. Huber R. Bartunik H.D. Wilson K. Schott K. Bacher A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 1045-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Through an elegant series of experiments, Bacher and co-workers (4Ritsert K. Huber R. Turk D. Ladenstein R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Bacher A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 151-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 5Bacher A. Fischer M. Kis K. Kugelbrey K. Mörtl S. Scheuring J. Weinkauf S. Eberhardt S. Schmidt-Bäse K. Hubert R. Ritsert K. Cushman M. Ladenstein R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have shown that the outer shell of the B. subtilis LS-RS complex consists of 60 LS subunits that are organized as 12 densely packed pentamers to form a hollow icosahedral capsid. Encaged within the central core of the sphere resides a single molecule of RS, a trimer of three identical subunits. It has been proposed that compartmentation of the two terminal enzymes in the LS·RS complex improves the overall catalytic efficiency of riboflavin production through “substrate channeling,” especially at low substrate concentrations (6Kis K. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16788-16795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although a bifunctional LS·RS complex has only been reported for certain strains ofBacillus and Clostridium (2Bacher A. Baur R. Eggers U. Harders H. Otto M.K. Schnepple H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 632-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is important to note that Escherichia coli LS also exists in vivoas a hollow icosahedral capsid of 60 identical subunits (7Mörtl S. Fischer M. Richter G. Tack J. Weinkauf S. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33201-33207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The functional significance of this single protein complex, if any, remains to be elucidated. LS catalyzes the penultimate step of riboflavin biosynthesis, namely the condensation of 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate (DHBP) with 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione (ARAPD) to yield one molecule each of orthophosphate and 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (DMRL) (Fig. 1). The latter is the immediate precursor of riboflavin. LS genes have been cloned from numerous microorganisms, including E. coli (8Taura T. Ueguchi C. Shiba K. Ito K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 234: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (9Fuller T.E. Mulks M.H. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23801-23807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In all cases, the subunit molecular mass of the encoded protein is small, ranging in size from ∼16 to 17 kDa. Although the various microbial lumazine synthases share certain structural features, their overall homology is rather poor. For example, the proteins from yeast and E. coli are only 36% identical at the amino acid sequence level. The ultimate step of riboflavin biosynthesis is mediated by RS, which catalyzes the dismutation of two molecules of DMRL to yield one molecule of riboflavin and one molecule of ARAPD. RS has been cloned from yeast and bacteria, and all of the species examined thus far exhibit marked internal homology in their N-terminal and C-terminal domains (13Schott K. Kellermann J. Lottspeich F. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4204-4209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Santos M.A. Garcia-Ramirez J.J. Revuelta J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 437-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Consequently, it has been proposed that the two “halves” of the RS protomer have arisen through gene duplication and that each contains a substrate-binding site for DMRL. Although the atomic structure of RS remains to be determined, it is known that theB. subtilis (2Bacher A. Baur R. Eggers U. Harders H. Otto M.K. Schnepple H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1966; 241: 2120-2136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) homologs are both trimers in the native state, each consisting of three identical ∼25-kDa subunits. It is frequently stated in the literature that plants can synthesize riboflavin (1Bacher A. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoproteins. 1. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 215-259Google Scholar). However, virtually nothing is known about the metabolic machinery that is responsible for this process. Apart from an arabidopsis GTP cyclohydrolase II that was recently cloned (16Kobayashi M. Sugiyama M. Yamamoto K. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 303-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), there are no reports of either homogeneous proteins or full-length cDNA sequences for any other enzyme that is involved in plant riboflavin biosynthesis. RS from spinach has been partially purified (17Mitsuda H. Kawai F. Suzuki Y. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18: 539-543Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), but there is no information on its primary structure. The arabidopsis GTP cyclohydrolase II is only 39–58% identical to its counterparts inE. coli, B. subtilis, and P. phosphoreum at the amino acid sequence level. Assuming that the other pathway enzymes have diverged to a similar degree, it is extremely doubtful that strategies that only rely on structural similarities to the known microbial homologs will be very useful in cloning the corresponding plant genes. In the present work, we have cloned LS genes from three plant species (spinach, tobacco, and arabidopsis) through their abilities to rescue an E. coli mutant whose endogenous LS gene was disrupted by insertional inactivation. Since this strategy relies only on functional similarities between the disrupted host gene and the target gene of interest, it is ideally suited for cloning heterologous proteins that catalyze the same reaction. Indeed, several bacterial (18Richter G. Volk R. Krieger C. Lahm H.-W. Röthlisberger U. Bacher A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4050-4056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Richter G. Ritz H. Katzenmeier G.

Yamamoto K. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 303-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), were identified through functional complementation of microbial riboflavin auxotrophs. Unexpectedly, higher plant LS is synthesized as a precursor protein with a cleavable N-terminal chloroplast targeting sequence. Upon post-translational import into the chloroplast stroma, the transit peptide is removed giving rise to the mature polypeptide. Mature spinach LS has been expressed in E. coli, purified to homogeneity, and characterized, both structurally and kinetically. Here we present the results of these studies. The spinach, tobacco, and arabidopsis λ cDNA expression libraries were obtained from Stratagene (catalog numbers 936005, 936002, and 937010, respectively). The E. coli LS gene (GenBankTM accession number X64395) was amplified from genomic DNA of strain W3110 (20Campbell J. Richardson C.C. Studier F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2276-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) using two PCR primers. 2For all PCR primers that appear in the text, the underlined bases hybridize to the target gene, and the unique restriction sites that were added for subcloning purposes are indicated in lowercase letters. Primer 1 (5′-CGA AGG AAG Acc atg gCCATTATTGAAGCTAACGTTGC-3′) introduces an NcoI site at the initiation codon, and primer 2 (5′-ATC TTA CTg tcg acTTCAGGCCTTGATGGCTTTC-3′) provides a SalI site just past the stop codon. The PCR fragment was cut with NcoI and SalI and ligated into similarly digested pGEM-5Zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI). The ligation mixture was used to transformE. coli DH5α, and growth was selected on LB media that contained ampicillin (100 μg/ml). A representative plasmid with an insert of the correct size (referred to below as “pGEM-LS”) was sequenced completely to confirm the absence of PCR errors. Next, the E. coli LS gene was insertionally inactivated. Briefly, a unique NotI site was introduced into the middle of its coding region, and a DNA fragment conferring kanamycin resistance was ligated into the engineered site. The selectable marker was provided by the Kanr GenBlock cartridge (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which was modified by PCR to add a NotI cleavage site to both of its ends. This was accomplished using primer 3 (5′-AAC TAG ATC Agc ggc cgc AGCCACGTTGTGTCTCAAA-3′) and primer 4 (5′-GAC AAA CAT Agc ggc cgcTGAGGTCTGCCTCGTGAA-3′) in a standard PCR reaction. The resulting fragment was cleaved with NotI and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. A unique NotI site was also introduced into the middle of the E. coli LS gene using “inverse PCR” (21Ochman H. Medhora M.M. Garza D. Hartl D.L. Innis M.A. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 219-227Google Scholar). The target for amplification was pGEM-LS, and the 100-μl reaction contained ∼0.5 ng of plasmid DNA and primer 5 (5′-AAC TAG ATC Agc ggc cgcGGTACGGTTATTCGTGGT-3′) and primer 6 (5′-GAC AAA CAT Agc ggccgcGTCGTATTTACCGGT-3′) each at 0.5 μm. The primers hybridize to the E. coli LS gene (GenBankTM accession number X64395) at nt 2273–2290 and nt 2243–2261, respectively, and each contains a NotI cleavage site at its 5′ end. The PCR product was cleaved withNotI and subjected to a standard ligation reaction with the modified Kanr GenBlock. The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli DH5α, and growth was selected on LB media that contained ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and kanamycin (30 μg/ml). A plasmid harboring the disrupted E. coli LS gene (referred to “pLSKan”) was sequenced completely to confirm that the selectable marker was inserted at the correct location. pLSKan was digested with NcoI and SalI to liberate the insertionally inactivated E. coli LS gene. The purified fragment was electroporated into E. coli JC7623, and growth was selected on LB media with riboflavin (400 μg/ml) (18Richter G. Volk R. Krieger C. Lahm H.-W. Röthlisberger U. Bacher A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4050-4056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and kanamycin (30 μg/ml). JC7623 was chosen as the initial recipient for gene replacement since it undergoes double-crossover homologous recombination at high frequency (22Wyman R.A. Wolfe L.B. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2880-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 23Balbas P. Alvarado X. Bolivar F. Valle F. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 136: 211-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 24Balbas P. Alexeyev M. Shokolenk I. Bolivar F. Valle F. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 172: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The correct chromosomal integration event was detected phenotypically. Mutants resulting from homologous recombination of the disrupted E. coli LS gene were resistant to kanamycin and could only grow in the presence of added riboflavin. Due to mutations in the recBCD loci, E. coliJC7623 is unable to propagate ColE1-type plasmids (Ref. 24Balbas P. Alexeyev M. Shokolenk I. Bolivar F. Valle F. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 172: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar and references therein). It was therefore necessary to move the disruptedE. coli LS gene from the chromosome of JC7623 to a suitable strain that could be used for screening cDNA libraries. This was accomplished through phage transduction using P1vir and well established methodologies (25Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1972: 201-205Google Scholar). The recipient strain was E. coli W3110 (20Campbell J. Richardson C.C. Studier F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2276-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and growth was selected on LB media with sodium citrate (7.5 mm), magnesium sulfate (1.5 mm), kanamycin (35 μg/ml), and riboflavin (400 μg/ml). A stable transductant, in which the disrupted E. coli LS gene had replaced the normal chromosomal copy, was identified phenotypically and was used for complementation cloning as described below; the mutant was resistant to kanamycin and could only grow in the presence of added riboflavin. λ cDNA expression libraries were subjected to mass excision according to the vendor's protocol. Upon excision, the cDNA inserts are contained in the plasmid vector, pBluescript, which confers ampicillin resistance. The plasmid mixture was then introduced into the E. coli LS null mutant using electroporation, and transformants were plated on LB media that contained sodium citrate (7.5 mm), magnesium sulfate (1.5 mm), kanamycin (35 μg/ml), ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and 0.6 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After a 48-h growth period at 37 °C, plasmids were isolated from representative colonies, and their cDNA inserts were sequenced completely. PCR primers were used to remove the chloroplast transit peptide from the cloned spinach LS precursor. Primer 7 (5′-CTA CTC ATT Tca tat gAA CGAGCTTGAAGGTTATGT CAC-3′) hybridizes to nt 205–224 of the DNA sequence shown in Fig. 2 and replaces Val-67 (the predicted start of the mature protein) with an initiator Met residue. It also provides a unique NdeI site for cloning purposes and changes the second residue of the mature protein from Arg to Asn. It was anticipated that these changes would not affect enzyme activity and might actually improve bacterial expression of spinach LS, since theE. coli and B. subtilis homologs both start with Met-Asn. Primer 8 (5′-CAT CTT ACT gga tcc ATC AGGCCTTCAAATGATGTTCG-3′) hybridizes at the other end of the gene to nt 648–667 (Fig. 2) and provides a unique BamHI site just past the stop codon. The PCR fragment was digested withNdeI and BamHI and ligated into the T7 expression vector, pET-24a(+) (Novagen), cleaved with the same enzymes. The construct was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3), and plasmid DNA from a selected transformant was sequenced completely to check for PCR errors; none were found. For protein production, the recombinant strain described above was grown at 37 °C in LB media containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml). Induction was with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) at an A600 nm of 0.7, and the cells were harvested 3 h later by centrifugation. A cell-free extract was prepared as described previously (26Dickson R. Larsen B. Viitanen P.V. Tormey M.B. Geske J. Strange R. Bemis L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26858-26864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and stored at −80 °C at a protein concentration of 31 mg/ml (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots (5 ml) of theE. coli cell-free extract were diluted 1:1 with water and applied to a Mono-Q HR 10/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated at 25 °C with Buffer Q (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm sodium sulfite, 1 mm EDTA). The column was developed at 4.0 ml/min with a linear gradient (120 ml) of 0–0.5 m NaCl (in Buffer Q). Four more aliquots of the extract were processed in the same manner, and fractions eluting between 0.35 and 0.38 m NaCl were pooled, supplemented with 5% glycerol, and concentrated to 22 mg/ml of protein; the recovery of protein was ∼135 mg. The entire sample was then fractionated on a TSK G3000SW gel filtration column (21 × 600 mm) in 2-ml aliquots. The column was developed at 4 ml/min with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 0.3 mNaCl (25 °C). Purified mature spinach LS emerged from the column as a single peak immediately after the void volume. Fractions eluting between 19.6 and 20.7 min were supplemented with 5% glycerol, concentrated to ∼20 mg of protein per ml, and stored at −80 °C. The final yield was ∼73 mg of purified protein. 3An extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 12,270m−1 cm−1 (as calculated from the GCG Peptidesort program) was used to determine protein concentrations. The full-length spinach LS precursor (original cDNA clone) was modified for insertion into theMscI and BamHI sites of the in vitrotranscription/translation vector, pCITE-4a(+) (Novagen) using PCR primers 8 and 9 (5′-TCA TTT CAT Atg gcc aGT TTTGCAGCTTCTCAAACTTGT-3′). As noted above, the former adds a unique BamHI site just after the stop codon, whereas the latter introduces an MscI site at the initiator Met residue; neither primer alters the primary sequence of the spinach LS precursor. The resulting construct was subjected to in vitrotranscription/translation using [35S]methionine and the “Single Tube Protein System 2, T7” kit (Novagen) according to the vendor's protocol. Reactions were terminated with 2× import buffer containing 60 mm unlabeled methionine (28Viitanen P.V. Doran E.R. Dunsmuir P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15000-15007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C for subsequent use. Chloroplasts were isolated from 13-day-old pea seedlings (Pisum sativum) and subjected to in vitro import assays (28Viitanen P.V. Doran E.R. Dunsmuir P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15000-15007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the radiolabeled spinach LS precursor. Protease post-treatment was used to distinguish between bound and imported polypeptides (28Viitanen P.V. Doran E.R. Dunsmuir P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15000-15007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29Cline K. Werner-Washburne M. Lubben T.H. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3691-3696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intact plastids were then repurified by centrifugation through Percoll cushions, resuspended in 100 μl of 2× gel sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/fluorography as described previously (28Viitanen P.V. Doran E.R. Dunsmuir P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15000-15007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial rates of lumazine formation were monitored spectrophotometrically at 408 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 10,000m−1cm−1 (30Plaut G.W.E. Harvey R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18: 515-538Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The 1-ml reactions contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm ARAPD, 1.0 mm DHBP, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and purified mature spinach LS at 37 °C; reactions were initiated with enzyme. Unless otherwise indicated, kinetic constants were obtained at 25 °C by holding ARAPD or DHBP at a fixed saturating concentration (0.5 mm), while varying the concentration of the other substrate. DHBP was synthesized enzymatically in a reaction containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm d-ribose 5-phosphate, 10 units/ml phosphoriboisomerase, and 0.3 units/ml purified E. coliDHBPS at 25 °C (18Richter G. Volk R. Krieger C. Lahm H.-W. Röthlisberger U. Bacher A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4050-4056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ARAPD was prepared from 4-ribitylamino-5-nitroso-2,6-dihydroxypyrimidine (30Plaut G.W.E. Harvey R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18: 515-538Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) by catalytic hydrogenation. The 40-ml reaction contained 0.4 mmol of the latter compound (in 10 mm acetic acid) and 20 mg of 10% palladium on carbon. After a 15-h incubation period at 25 °C (under 50 pounds/square inch H2), the catalyst was removed by filtration and the ARAPD-containing filtrate was stored at −80 °C. ARAPD and DHBP concentrations were determined by enzymatic conversion to DMRL, with one of the substrates limiting and the other in excess. SDS-PAGE was performed with 15% gels (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) that were aged overnight. For Western blots, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, reacted with antisera against the purified recombinant spinach LS, and sequentially probed with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG and streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase, which were both from Vector Laboratories. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was performed on a Fisons VG Quattro 11, calibrated with myoglobin; the sample was analyzed at a concentration of 20 μm protomer in acetonitrile/water/formic acid (50/50/0.5). PCR amplification was with the GeneAmp PCR Reagent kit using a DNA Thermocycler 480 (Perkin-Elmer). Automated DNA sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems Inc. 377 using custom-designed primers. Amino acid sequence comparisons and alignments were performed using the GAP and PILEUP programs of the Genetics Computer Group (Wisconsin package, version 9, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). For sedimentation equilibrium studies, spinach LS (33 μmprotomer) in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 was placed into two separate sectors of a six-sectored cell and centrifuged at 4 °C and 4500 rpm in an XL-A Optima (Beckman) analytical centrifuge; the reference sectors contained the same buffer. After 28, 47, and 72 h of centrifugation absorbances at 280 nm of the six-sectored cell were scanned stepwise at 0.02-mm intervals with 10 readings per step. The absorbance data were fit to a model for an ideal monodisperse system having a partial specific volume of 0.724 as calculated from Ref. 32Cohn E.J. Edsall E.T. Proteins, Amino Acids, and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Reinhold Publications Co., New York1943: 374-377Google Scholar. For electron microscopy, purified recombinant mature spinach LS was diluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 0.3 m NaCl, negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate, and examined in a Zeiss 902 transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV. Micrographs were recorded at a nominal magnification of 50,000; bacteriophage T4 was used for calibration (33Moody M. Makowski L. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 150: 217-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” a spinach cDNA library was screened for functional complementation of an E. coli LS knockout mutant. The library was introduced by electroporation, and transformants were plated in the absence of added riboflavin. Reversion to riboflavin prototrophy occurred at a frequency of ∼4 × 10−6, and one of the complementing plasmids (designated pPVLS22) was selected for further analysis; the latter contained a cDNA insert of ∼1.3 kilobase pairs. Shown in Fig. 2 is the complete nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the spinach protein that rescued theE. coli LS null mutant. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 222 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 23,426.46 Da. Although there are unmistakable similarities between the higher plant protein and known microbial LS homologs, there are also some important differences. The most obvious discrepancy is that spinach LS is a much larger protein (Fig. 3). Fused to its N terminus is a stretch of ∼65 additional amino acid residues that are not present in known bacterial and fungal counterparts. That this polypeptide extension is relatively basic and rich in Ser and Thr residues suggests that it could be a chloroplast targeting sequence (34Gavel Y. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). According to this scenario, spinach LS is synthesized in the plant cytosol as a larger molecular weight precursor and is subsequently taken up by chloroplasts where it is cleaved to its mature size. Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict with"

For this purpose, de-greening of excised green primary leaves of barley (Hordeum vulgare) was induced by permanent darkness in the presence of heavy water (80 atom % 2H). The resulting Chla catabolite in the plant extract was subjected to chemical degradation by chromic acid. 3-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-maleimide, the key fragment that originates from the Chl catabolite, was isolated. High resolution 1H-, 2H-NMR and mass spectroscopy unequivocally demonstrates that a fraction of this maleimide fragment consists of a mono-deuterated methyl group. These results suggest that Chl b is converted into Chla before degradation. Quantification proves that the initial ratio of Chl a:Chl b in the green plant is preserved to about 60–70% in the catabolite composition isolated from yellowing leaves. The incorporation of only one deuterium atom indicates the involvement of two distinguishable redox enzymes during the conversion.

Scheer H. Chlorophylls. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 3-30Google Scholar). As a matter of fact, although both Chla and b catabolites were found in the green algaChlorella protothecoides, only catabolites originating from Chl a were isolated from higher plants (2Hörtensteiner S. Vincentini F. Matile P. New Phytol. 1995; 129: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 3Curty C. Engel N. Phytochemistry. 1996; 42: 1531-1536Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The following observations have led to the hypothesis that in higher plants Chlb is converted into Chl a before degradation: (i) A system comprising isolated etioplasts of cucumber Cucumis sativus showed that chlorophyllide b is converted to Chl a (4Ito H. Tanaka Y. Tsuji H. Tanaka A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies of a system consisting of barley (Hordeum vulgare) etioplasts showed that chlorophyllide b is converted via 71-hydroxy Chla to Chl a; both steps required the presence of ATP in the incubation mixture (5Ito H. Ohtsuka T. Tanaka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1475-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). (ii) In vitro chlorophyll degradation experiments with membrane fractions of senescent chloroplasts of rape cotyledons (Brassica napus) have shown that Pheo b is refused as substrate of the ring cleaving pheophorbide oxygenase under the condition that Pheo a is accepted (2Hörtensteiner S. Vincentini F. Matile P. New Phytol. 1995; 129: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). (iii) Zn(II) Pheo b was converted to Zn(II) 71-hydroxy Chl a in intact barley etioplasts, the reduction required NADPH or NADH. NADH was found to be less effective, ATP was not essential (6Scheumann V. Ito H. Tanaka A. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). (iv) Fully senescent cotyledons of rape (B. napus) contain amounts of Chl acatabolites 7a-c accounting for 90% of total Chls originally present in the mature leaf tissue (2Hörtensteiner S. Vincentini F. Matile P. New Phytol. 1995; 129: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 7Mühlecker W. Kräutler B. Ginsburg S. Matile P. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1993; 76: 2976-2980Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Chl a to Chl b conversion appears now to be part of a general Chl a(b) interconversion cycle, which is considered to play an important role in the formation and reorganization of the photosynthetic apparatuses (5Ito H. Ohtsuka T. Tanaka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1475-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and which enables plants to adapt to high and low light conditions by adjusting the ratio Chl a:Chl b from 3.8–4.8 to 2.7–3.0, respectively (8Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedmann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4534) Google Scholar). In vivo labeling experiments with heavy water to elucidate biogenesis mechanisms are barely mentioned in the literature. The method has been applied to study peripheral changes of the porphyrin system during the biosynthesis of bacteriochlorophyll a in the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum (9Dougherty R.C. Crespi H.L. Strain H.H. Katz J.J. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1966; 88: 2854-2855Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 10Katz J.J. Dougherty R.C. Crespi H.L. Strain H.H. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1966; 88: 2856-2875Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and to follow the insertion of a deuteron during the light induced cyclization of dark synthesized acyclic carotenoide precursors in the green alga Senedesmus obliquus (11Britton G. Lockley W. Powls R. Goodwin T. Heyes L.M. Nature. 1977; 268: 81-82Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recently we have demonstrated by in vivo deuterium labeling experiments withC. protothecoides that in the last step of the macrocyclic ring cleavage a hydrogen atom is highly stereoselectively inserted in the catabolite (12Curty C. Engel N. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1997; 35: 707-711Google Scholar). In this work we evince by spectroscopic methods that during the de-greening of barley leaves (H. vulgare) in heavy water a fraction of the Chl a catabolite is deuterium labeled; specifically one deuterium atom is incorporated in the methyl group of the apparent chlorophyll a catabolite. The results suggest that Chl b is converted to Chl a by two different cofactors. All chemicals were reagent grade; all solvents were distilled before use. Heavy water containing 80 atom % deuterium was supplied from Armar AG, CH-5312 Döttingen (Switzerland). Thin layer chromatography aluminum foils pre-coated with silica gel 60PF254+366 (0.2 mm) and silica gel 60PF (0.040–0.063 mm) for column chromatography were purchased from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany and 35cc Sep-Pack® Vac C-18, 10 g from Waters (Milford, MA). Barley seeds (H. vulgare L. cv. Gerbel) were a gift from Florimond Desprez, Cappelle-en-Pévèle 59242 Templeuve, France. The seeds were germinated in high density (5 seeds/cm2) in moist garden soil, purchased from a local market, and grown for about 7–10 days in natural light until the primary leaves reached about 10–15 cm in height. 1H-, 13C-, and 2H-NMR measurements were performed on a Bruker Avance DRX-500 spectrometer operating at the frequencies of 500.13, 125.75, or 76.77 MHz, respectively. Samples were dissolved in CDCl3. Chemical shifts were recorded in ppm downfield from tetramethylsilane except for deuterium NMR in which CDCl3, δ = 7.27 ppm was used as internal standard. 1H-Spectra for the labeled material were recorded at a resolution of 7.63·10−5 ppm/data point. Gaussian multiplication of the free induction decay (13Sanders J.K.M. Hunter B.K. Modern NMR Spectroscopy. Oxford University Press, Oxford1990Google Scholar, 14Thiele H. Germanus A. Paape R. Krygsman P. 1D Win-NMR Manual, Release 940701. Brucker-Franzen Analytik GmbH, Bremen, Germany1994Google Scholar) was performed on the NMR-Unix station with UXNMR version 2.1. (Parameters used: Gaussian broadening = 0.5 Hz, line broadening = −0.55 Hz). Mass spectra were obtained with a Bruker FTMS 4.7T BioAPEXII, using chemical ionization (CI) or electrospray ionization techniques in the positive mode. Electrospray ionization spectra were expanded in the range of the molecular ion up to a resolution of 150,000. The most recent IUPAC data for atomic mass and natural abundance of the elements were used to calculate exact molecular masses (15Commission on Atomic Weights and Isotopic Abundances Report for the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry Pure Appl. Chem. 1998; 70: 217-235Crossref Scopus (787) Google Scholar) The procedure was similar as described previously (16Kräutler B. Jaun B. Bortlik K. Schellenberg M. Matile P. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1991; 30: 1315-1318Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar) but with the following modifications: To arrest chlorophyll biosynthesis the green intact shoots were left at 25 °C for 12 h in permanent darkness. Afterward, batches of green primary leaves (100 g wet weight; 12 g dry weight) were cut 10–15 cm from the apex and immersed with their ends in heavy water (100 ml, 80 atom % 2H). The opening of the 1,000 ml beakers was covered with punctured aluminum foil to allow gas exchange. The leaves were subsequently incubated at 25 °C during 7–8 days in permanent darkness. When the green color of the Chls had vanished, the yellowish still turgid leaves were collected and stored frozen until use. Unlabeled natural material was obtained accordingly using tap water instead of heavy water. The watering layer was sporadically sampled, and the deuterium content of the water was determined by standard1H-NMR (360 MHz) procedure in which the remaining proton signal in the samples was measured. A sealed capillary filled with acetone was used as external proton standard whose signal area was determined from the area of pure water (H2O) set to 100 atom % 1H; a relaxation delay of 60 s was applied during measurements to the sample. De-greened yellow leaves of H. vulgare (150 g wet weight) were homogenized in a blender with a mixture of 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8:AcMe:MeOH = 1:1:1 (300 ml). The resultant slurry was filtered over two layers of cotton gauze, the residue was washed with the disintegration buffer (2 × 150 ml). The collected filtrates were centrifuged at 5,000 ×gav for 10 min. Pellets were discarded and the supernatants were extracted with CH2Cl2 (2 × 400 ml). After phase separation the aqueous layer was shortly evaporated in vacuo to remove residual solvent. The remaining solution (200 ml) was filtered through a reversed phase column (35cc Sep-Pack® Vac C-18 cartridges). Afterward the cartridge was washed with 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 (50 ml) and eluted with a 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8:AcMe = 1:1 (150 ml) solution. Retention and elution of the catabolite in the cartridge was controlled by a microscale chromic acid degradation assay using aliquots of the eluate (vide infra). Positive reacting fractions were pooled (120 ml), the volatile organic solvent was withdrawn in vacuo leaving a dark brown aqueous phase (60 ml). A solution consisting of 2n H2SO4 and 1% CrO3 (60 ml) was added with stirring at room temperature for 5 min. The resulting solution was continuously extracted overnight with diethyl ether. The sodium sulfate dried ether phase was evaporated to incipient dryness, and the residue was applied to four TLC plates. The plates were developed in CH2Cl2/AcOEt/EtOH/AcOH (50:10:5:0.5). The section of the TLC foil containing maleimide fragment 9 was cut out and eluted with methanol (50 ml). Evaporation of the filtrate in vacuo left a residue, which was two times purified by microcolumn chromatography (∅ = 4 mm, length = 10 cm) using silica gel as stationary and CH2Cl2/acetone (8:2) as mobile phase.

The ether solution was spotted on thin layer chromatography and developed in CH2Cl2:AcMe (8:2); RF(9) = 0.27. The maleimide fragments were visualized with Cl2/benzidine (19Rüdiger W.

Fig. 1shows the constitutional formulae of the catabolites isolated so far and reveals that they are all bile-pigment-like linear tetrapyrroles derived from an oxygenolytic cleavage at the C(4)=C(5) bondage of the former Chls. De-greening experiments were performed with green primary leaves of H. vulgare in heavy water (80 atom %2H) or in tap water, respectively. The crude enriched plant extract was directly subjected to the chromic acid degradation procedure basically developed for porphyrins (19Rüdiger W. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol.

The particular maleimide fragment 3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-maleimide (9) (Fig. 2), which contains the characteristic β-hydroxyethyl as marker group of the former Chla catabolite of H. vulgare, was isolated and spectroscopically analyzed. 1H- and 13C-NMR and mass spectra of the synthetic and the unlabeled natural material were alike and in accordance with structure 9. All seven carbon-bound protons were assigned by chemical shift reasoning, coupling constants, and integral values (see “Experimental Procedures”). The N-bound hydrogen atom occurred as single broad signal and the O-bound proton was part of the water peak of the solvent.Figure 2Isolated maleimides 8, 9, and 10 obtained after CrO3 oxidation of an extract from de-greened leaves of H. vulgare. Of the three fragments analyzed by 1H-NMR only a fraction of the methyl group of9 was deuterium labeled. The constitution of the Chla catabolite from H. vulgare 5 (16Kräutler B. Jaun B. Bortlik K.

After Gaussian multiplication of the free induction decay and amplification this signal group unambiguously displays the resonance pattern of a mono-deuterated methyl group (Fig. 3). The resonance is centered at δ = 1.995 ppm and appears as a characteristic triplet × triplet. In a double resonance experiment in which the methylene group C(31) at δ = 2.67 ppm was irradiated, the triplet of the tri-protio-methyl group collapsed as expected into a singlet and the signal group into a simple triplet with a coupling constant ofJ1H-2H= 2.4 Hz in a ratio of 1:1:1 (Fig. 3). Both, spin multiplicity and signal ratio immediately evince due to the nuclear spin quantum number I = 1 of deuterium that the number of deuterium atoms in the methyl group equals 1. The mono-deuterated methyl group is up-field shifted by Δδ = 0.017 ppm relative to the tri-protio-methyl group. This effect is within the range commonly observed for primary isotopic effects (29Davis D.B. Christofides J.C. Hoffman R.D. R. Soc. Chem. Spec. Publ. 1988; 68: 147-172Google Scholar, 30Allred A.L. Wilk W.D. Chem. Commun. 1969; 1969: 273Crossref Google Scholar). Integration of the signal of the tri-protio-methyl group versus the mono-deutero-methyl group revealed a proton ratio of about 100:4.7. From this figure a ratio of9:9 -d1 of 100:7.1 was calculated. The 2H-NMR spectrum confirmed the presence of one deuterium atom by a triplet (J1H-2H = 2.4 Hz) centered at δ = 2.1 ppm; no other signals were present except the solvent peak (spectrum not shown). Samples were measured in an ion cyclotron resonance spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization inlet. Fig. 4 shows the isotopic fine structure at a resolving power of 150,000. The observed molecular peak ion [12C71H914N16O323Na]+was calibrated to m/z 178.048 and an integral value of 100. Table I opposes the calculated and measured values. The signals are base line separated exhibiting the expected mass difference of 3 × 10−3 amu. The ion at 179.051 amu [12C613C1H914N16O323Na]+contains carbon-13 and shows the predicted abundance of 7.7 rel %, which is because of the 13C natural abundance of 7 × 1.10 rel %. The second satellite signal at 179.054 amu [12C71H82H14N16O323Na]+contains 2H and presents the number of molecules in which one protium is replaced by one deuterium. This fraction occurs with an abundance of 6.2 rel % from which 0.1 rel % was subtracted because of the natural abundance of deuterium of 9 × 0.015. The molar ratio of 9:9-d1 is therefore 100:6.1.Table ICalculated and measured mass spectroscopic data of the unlabeled and labeled maleimide 9 in the range of the nominal masses 178 and 179aIsotopic mass and natural abundance of the constituting elements were taken from the literature (15Commission on Atomic Weights and Isotopic Abundances Report for the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry Pure Appl.

The ratio of Chl a:Chl b in the leaves during de-greening was followed by high pressure liquid chromatography of a methanol extract (Fig. 5). At the beginning of the incubation experiment this ratio was determined to be 79:21 (100:26). After 8 days in permanent darkness the incubation was terminated. About 10% Chl a and 24% Chl b of the initial content still remained unchanged in the leaves, which means that about 90% Chla and 76% Chl b had vanished. Under the assumption that both Chls are totally converted into catabolites, a ratio Chl a:Chl b of 81:19 (100:23) should be expected. Random labeling of Chl b in a medium of water containing 80 atom % 2H should yield 80% mono-deuterium labeled Chl a and 20% of a “protio-labeled” Chla catabolite in a ratio9:9-d1 of 100:17.6. As a matter of fact, the deuterium content of the heavy water in the beaker slowly diminished during the incubation period from 80 atom %2H to an equilibrium concentration of 55 atom %2H due to the dilution with protic water contained in the leaves (Fig. 6). Under the assumption that the number of deuterium atoms and the initial volume of 100 ml of water remains constant during the experiment the deuterium content of the leaves at each sampling point was calculated from the deuterium concentration of the watering layer and the equilibrium concentration by Eq. 1.xl=(xt=0−xt=s)(xt=0−xequ)·xequEquation 1 where xl = atom % 2H in the leaves at the sampling time; xt=0 = atom %2H in the water layer at zero time (80%);xt=s = atom % 2H in the water layer at sampling time; xequ = atom % 2H in the water layer at equilibrium (55%).Figure 6Exchange rate between the leaves and the heavy water reservoir. Upper curve, time dependent dilution of the heavy water reservoir due to leaking of ordinary water from the leaves. An equilibrium concentration of 55 atom %2H was reached after about 192 h. Lower curve, the deuterium content in the leaves was calculated from the deuterium content of the watering layer and the equilibrium concentration. The vertically hatched area when subtracted from the total area limited by the dotted equilibrium line furnishes the horizontal hatched area, which represents the total amount of water (H2O) in the leaves during the de-greening period.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The area under the calculated curve, which presents the time course of the relative amounts of 55 atom % 2H in the leaves, was subtracted from the total area given by the square of the equilibrium concentration (55 atom % 2H) and the incubation time (192 h). The difference assigns the total of the relative portion of pure water (H2O) in mixture with 55 atom % 2H in the leaves due to the slow exchange rate. This portion (13.6%) together with the protic fraction of the equilibrium mixture (45%) converts Chl b into the nonlabeled apparent Chl ain an amount of 1.4 and 7.7 rel %, respectively; the sum was therefore subtracted from the portion of Chl b and surcharged to Chla. A theoretical ratio of9:9 -d1 of 100:9.5 was calculated from those figures. This result is in close agreement with the spectroscopic measurements of a9:9 -d1 relation of 100:6.1 for MS and 100:7.1 for 1H-NMR and accounts for 64 and 74%, respectively, of the theoretical value. The overall yield was calculated as follows. According to the literature, 115 g H. vulgare leaves afforded 13 mg of the intact catabolite 5 which represents a recovery rate of 10% of the original Chls (16Kräutler B. Jaun B. Bortlik K. Schellenberg M. Matile P. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1991; 30: 1315-1318Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Quantitative conversion with CrO3 oxidation to the maleimide fragment9 should therefore yield 3.7 mg per 150 g leaves. In this labeling experiment 1.7 mg of purified 9 was isolated from 150 g leaves, which represents a yield of 46%. This loss is in agreement with the low yields of maleimides generally obtained from CrO3 oxidation of porphyrins (31Bonnet R. Mc Donagh A.F. Chem. Ind. 1969; 1969: 107-108Google Scholar). The ratio unlabeled to labeled 9 reflects both the isotopic composition of the deuterium concentration in the medium and the exchange and hydrogen transfer reaction, which occur during biodegradation. Formally two hydride ions are required to reduce an aldehyde group to a methyl group. Depending on the mechanism, up to two deuterium atoms per methyl group can be incorporated during the catabolic process of Chl b in the presence of heavy water (Fig. 7). We found that only one deuterium atom was incorporated. This fact demonstrates that of the hydrogen isotopes forming the methyl group of the labeled Chl a catabolite one originates from the formyl group of the former Chl b, one arrives by hydride transfer from an as yet unidentified carbon-bond hydrogen source, and another enters the methyl group as proton/deuteron from the surrounding water (Fig. 8). Enzymatic reduction of an aldehyde group to the corresponding alcohol is generally accomplished by nicotinamide-dependent hydride carriers NAD(P)H (32Walsh C. Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms, Sect. III. W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco1979: 311-357Google Scholar,33Clarke A.R. Dafforn T.R. Sinnot M. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. III. Academic Press, Toronto1997: 1-82Google Scholar). It is a hallmark of these coenzymes not to exchange with the deuterium of the surrounding medium (34Colowick S.P. van Eys J. Park J.H. Florkin M. Stotz E.H. Comprehensive Biochemistry. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1966: 1-98Google Scholar). We assume that a hydride ion is mediated by a NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H between a carbon-bond hydrogen such as for example (poly)saccharides, which were acquired during the phototrophic growth phase of the plant in ordinary water and the formyl group. This assumption is supported by ex vivoexperiments in which NAD(P)H was essential to reduce Zn(II) pheophorbide b to the corresponding 71-hydroxy-Chl a (6Scheumann V. Ito H. Tanaka A. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Reductive elimination of a hydroxyl group is generally a more difficult task due to the strong carbon-oxygen bond. This is the reason why enzymatic examples are rarely found in the literature (5Ito H. Ohtsuka T. Tanaka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1475-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 35Stubbe J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1990; 63: 349-419PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the unique electronic arrangement of the cyclic 18-π electron porphyrin system facilitates the formation of a resonance-stabilized carbocation 12 (Fig. 8). This elimination process demands an activator capable to transform the hydroxyl group into a better leaving group. In this context it is noteworthy that ATP, which can act as activator was required for the transformation of chlorophyllide b to Chl a in barley etioplasts (5Ito H. Ohtsuka T. Tanaka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1475-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) but not for the first reduction step to 71-hydroxy Pheo a (7Mühlecker W. Kräutler B. Ginsburg S. Matile P. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1993; 76: 2976-2980Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Most recently, it has been demonstrated that the final reduction step is achieved when reduced spinach ferredoxin is added to lysed etioplasts (36Scheumann V. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35102-35108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Ferredoxins participate in electron transfer reactions, electrons are typically provided by an electron transfer chain involving NADH and/or flavoproteins (33Clarke A.R. Dafforn T.R. Sinnot M. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. III. Academic Press, Toronto1997: 1-82Google Scholar). Therefore, we regard cation 12 as terminal electron acceptor, which becomes reduced by two electrons to the corresponding carbanion. Final quenching of the latter with a proton/deuteron from the aqueous medium would account for the observed statistically mono-deuterium labeling of the methyl group. It has been suggested that 12 and/or 14 (Fig. 8) are possible intermediates (37Porra R.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 65: 492-516Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, 1H- and 2H-NMR spectra show no deuterium label in the ethyl group of the maleimide fragment 9; isomerization occurs, if at all, only very slowly. The catabolic sequence Chl b → Chl a → Chla catabolite is more likely to proceed than a subsequent conversion of an assumed Chl b catabolite for the following reasons: (i) Pheo a oxygenase appears to be highly specific, the enzyme uses Pheo a as substrate but refuses Pheob (vide supra). (ii) Independent proofs have shown that the Chl a(b) converting enzymes are present in higher plants (vide supra). (iii) The proposed cation 12 is stabilized by resonance through the extended electronic 18π-system of the Chl macrocycle, whereas the formation of a corresponding cation from 71-hydroxy-Chl bcatabolite would be less favored by resonance. Chromic acid oxidation of the bile-pigment-like chlorophyll catabolite5 of H. vulgare present in the enriched plant extract afforded in addition to 9 the corresponding maleimides 8 and 10 (Fig. 2). 1H- and 2H-NMR spectroscopic investigation showed that of the three maleimides isolated from the plant extract only maleimide 9was partially mono-deuterium labeled at C(41), all others (data not shown) were not. During de novo biosynthesis of the Chls all methyl groups should become evenly mono-deuterated in heavy water because of the consecutive decarboxylation of uroporphyrinogen III to coproporphyrinogen III by uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase. This result confirms apart from Chla(b) interconversion the general assumption that angiosperms form no Chls in the dark (17Leeper F.J. Scheer H. Chlorophylls. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 407-431Google Scholar). We are indebted to Florimond Despez, Cappelle-en-Pévèle F-59242 Templeuve for providing us withHordeum vulgare L. cv. Gerbel.

https://openalex.org/W2059984966,"Peptides displayed on the cell surface by major histocompatibility class I molecules (MHC class I) are generated by proteolytic processing of protein-antigens in the cytoplasm. Initially, antigens are degraded by the 26 S proteasome, most probably following ubiquitination. However, it is unclear whether this proteolysis results in the generation of MHC class I ligands or if further processing is required. To investigate the role of the 26 S proteasome in antigen presentation, we analyzed the processing of an intact antigen by purified 26 S proteasome. A recombinant ornithine decarboxylase was produced harboring the H-2Kb-restricted peptide epitope, derived from ovalbumin SIINFEKL (termed ODC-ova). Utilizing recombinant antizyme to target the antigen to the 26 S proteasome, we found that proteolysis of ODC-ova by the 26 S proteasome resulted in the generation of the Kb-ligand. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that in addition to SIINFEKL, the N-terminally extended ligand, HSIINFEKL, was also generated. Production of SIINFEKL was linear with time and directly proportional to the rate of ODC-ova degradation. The overall yield of SIINFEKL was approximately 5% of the amount of ODC-ova degraded. The addition of PA28, the 20 S, or the 20 S-PA28 complex to the 26 S proteasome did not significantly affect the yield of the antigenic peptide. These findings demonstrate that the 26 S proteasome can efficiently digest an intact physiological substrate and generate an authentic MHC class I-restricted epitope.

Antigenic peptides presented through class I molecules are generated in the cytoplasm by proteolytic degradation of endogenously synthesized antigens. Suitable peptides are then translocated through specialized peptide transporters (termed TAP) to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where they bind and subsequently stabilize newly synthesized MHC class I molecules. Assembled class I molecules then migrate to the cell surface for recognition by T cells (1Heemels M.-T. Ploegh H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 463-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). There is now substantial evidence implicating the proteasome in antigen processing. When membrane-permeable inhibitors of proteasomes were added to cells, they severely inhibited proteasome activity in vitro, the cellular turnover of short and long lived proteins, and assembly of class I molecules as well as presentation of ovalbumin (OVA) introduced into the cytoplasm (2Rock K.L.

Proteasomes are multicatalytic complexes that constitute the major proteolytic activity in the cytosol and nucleus of all eukaryotes. Proteasomes are found in the cytoplasm as 20 and 26 S particles. The 20 S proteasome is a barrel-shaped complex consisting of four stacked rings, each composed of seven related subunits. The outer rings are formed by noncatalytic α subunits, whereas catalytic β subunits occupy the inner two rings. The 20 S proteasome is an ATP-independent protease that in vitro cleaves only peptides. It can also digest several unfolded proteins, but only when activated by treatment with SDS (4Eytan E. Ganoth D. Armon T. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7751-7755Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 5Dick L.R. Aldrich C. Jameson S.C. Moomaw C.R. Pramanick B.C. Doyle C.K. DeMartino G.N. Bevan M.J. Forman J.M. Slaughter C.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3884-3894PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological function of the 20 S proteasome is therefore obscure. The 20 S complex forms the catalytic core of the 26 S proteasome. The 26 S proteasome is formed by an ATP-dependent association of the 20 S core particle with one or two ATPase regulatory complexes termed PA700 (or 19 S particle) at one or both ends of the 20 S proteasome barrel, respectively. The 26 S proteasome is an ATP-dependent protease that degrades mainly ubiquitinated proteins (4Eytan E. Ganoth D. Armon T. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In vertebrates, Interferon-γ induces the replacement of three constitutive catalytic β subunits of the 20 S proteasomes, (X, Y, and Z) with three homologues (LMP7, LMP2, and MECL-1) in newly synthesized proteasomes (termed “immunoproteasomes”). Through use of precursor peptides, it has been demonstrated that incorporation of LMP2 and LMP7 may alter the cleavage specificity of the 20 S proteasome in a manner that favors the generation of antigenic peptides (7Driscoll J.

In vivo, it has been shown that LMP2 and LMP7 are not obligatory for antigen presentation (9Momburg F. Ortiz-Navarette V. Neefjes J. Goulmy E. van de Wal Y. Spits H. Powis S.J. Butcher G.W.

Elliot T. Trowsdale J. Townsend A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The 20 S proteasome can also associate with the PA28 activator complex (11 S regulator) that enhances in vitro cleavage of short peptides but not of proteins (12Dubiel W. Pratt G. Ferrell K.

Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 785-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To explain the effect of PA28 on antigen presentation in vivo, it was proposed that the 26 S proteasome initially degrades protein-antigens into long peptides, which are then processed into the MHC ligands by either the 20 S or the 20 S-PA28 complex (19Tanaka K. Kasahara M. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that a hybrid PA700-20 S-PA28 complex can generate the MHC ligand in one step (19Tanaka K. Kasahara M. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 20Hendil K.B. Khan S. Tanaka K. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It has been shown that increased susceptibility to ubiquitination can facilitate class I-restricted presentation of antigens in vivo (21Townsend A. Bastin J. Gould B. Brownlee G. Andrew M. Coupar B. Boyle D. Chan S. Smith G. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1211-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 22Tobery T.W. Siliciano R.F. J. Exp.

We have directly demonstrated that ubiquitination of modified OVA is obligatory for the generation of a specific MHC class I-restricted epitope in an in vitro system from lymphocyte lysate (24Ben-Shahar S. Cassouto B. Novak L. Porgador A. Reiss Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21060-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is most likely that degradation by the 26 S proteasome is the initial step in the processing of antigens. However, it is not known whether the breakdown of the antigen by the 26 S proteasome generates the MHC ligand or only longer intermediates that require additional trimming. Previously, extensive research has focused on the mode of action and regulation of the 20 S proteasome in antigen processing. These studies indicated that isolated 20 S proteasomes and 20 S-PA28 complexes can generate MHC class I-restricted epitopes from long peptides and chemically denatured proteins (3Beninga J. Goldberg A. Peters J.M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum Press, New York1998: 191-222Crossref Google Scholar). However, the physiological relevance of these artificial model experiments is uncertain, since antigens are most likely globular proteins and as such are probably degraded by the ATP-dependent 26 S proteasome (25Rechsteiner M. Peteres J.M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum Press, New York1998: 147-189Crossref Google Scholar). Indeed, Yellen-Shawet al. (26Yellen-Shaw A.J. Wherry E.J. Dubois G.C. Eisenlohr L.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3227-3234PubMed Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that processing of peptides might be different from that of proteins. The researchers demonstrated that a point mutation in the flanking sequence of an influenza nucleoprotein-derived epitope that inhibited class I presentation from full-length nucleoprotein had no effect when the same epitope was expressed as a minigene (26Yellen-Shaw A.J. Wherry E.J. Dubois G.C. Eisenlohr L.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3227-3234PubMed Google Scholar). The major impediment to an investigation of the function of the 26 S proteasome in antigen processing was lack of physiological protein-antigens that could serve as substrates for this protease. Most proteins are targeted to proteolysis by the 26 S proteasome through prior conjugation to ubiquitin. Unfortunately, ubiquitin-antigen conjugates are extremely difficult to produce and purify in quantities required for in vitro processing experiments. We circumvented the requirement for antigen-ubiquitin conjugates by utilizing the unique mechanism by which ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is targeted to degradation. Whereas ubiquitination is required for the degradation of most proteins by the 26 S proteasome, ODC becomes susceptible to enhanced ATP-dependent degradation (without ubiquitination) through prior association with a chaperone-like protein termed antizyme (AZ) (27Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). ODC is a homodimer but becomes a heterodimer upon binding to AZ. This induces a conformational change that targets the protein for degradation by the 26 S proteasome (28Hayashi S. Murakami M. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We expressed a recombinant ODC harboring the OVA-derived Kb-restricted epitope SIINFEKL. We then utilized anin vitro degradation system previously described by Togunaga and co-workers (29Togunaga F. Goto T. Koide T. Murakami Y. Hayashi S. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17382-17385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to test the proteolytic processing of the antigen (termed ODC-ova). In a system that contains purified AZ and 26 S proteasome, we show that in the presence of ATP, the recombinant antigen is degraded by the 26 S proteasome and that proteolysis results in the generation of the Kb epitope. Pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate was synthesized by Al-Coat (Ness Ziona, Israel). Amylose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Synthetic SIINFEKL was synthesized by Anaspec (San Jose, CA). Succinyl-Leu-Leu-Tyr-AMC was purchased from Sigma. The multiple antigen peptide SIINFEKL was synthesized by Peptide Technologies Corp. (Gaithersburg, MD). Amylose affinity resin was from New England Biolabs Inc. Bestatin was from Calbiochem. CompleteTM protease inhibitors (referred to as protease inhibitors) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All standard reagents and reagents for cell culture were from Sigma. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment goat anti-mouse IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Dr. Angel Porgador (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) kindly provided monoclonal antibody 25-D1.16. Anti-SIINFEKL antiserum was raised in rabbits immunized with the multiple antigen peptide SIINFEKL. Two-month-old New Zealand White rabbits were subcutaneously injected with 1 mg each of multiple antigen peptide SIINFEKL in complete Freund's adjuvant. The animals then received two boosts of 0.5 mg each of multiple antigen peptide SIINFEKL in incomplete Freund's adjuvant at intervals of 3 weeks. Ten days after the second boost, the rabbits were bled, and serum was prepared. The serum was tested by immunoblot analysis using OVA as antigen and preimmune serum as control. The mouse full-length ODC cDNA in pBluescript with aNcoI site spanning the initiator ATG was a kind gift from Dr. Chaim Kahana (The Weizmann Institute, Rehovot, Israel). The full-length ODC cDNA was subcloned in pUC18 at the KpnI (5′) and BamHI (3′) sites, resulting in the plasmid pUC-ODC. The ODC cDNA was then isolated from pUC-ODC as anNcoI/BamHI fragment and cloned in theNcoI (5′) and BamHI (3′) sites of pET19b (Novagen), resulting in the expression plasmid pET-ODC. To generate the ODC-ova expression vector, an adaptor encoding the peptide SIINFEKL with BstXI-compatible ends was generated by annealing the two synthetic oligonucleotides, 5′-ATAGTATAATCAACTTCGAAAAACTGAGCTC-3′ and 5′-TCAGTTTTTCCGAAGTTGATTATACTATGGC-3′. The adaptor was then inserted in frame at the unique BstXI site in the ODC sequence in pUC-ODC to generate the plasmid pUC-ODCova. The ODC-ova cDNA was then isolated from pUC-ODCova as anNcoI/BamHI fragment and cloned in theNcoI (5′) and BamHI (3′) sites of pET14b (Novagen), resulting in the expression plasmid pET-ODCova. The insertion of the adaptor in the correct orientation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids pET-ODC and pET-ODCova were used to express ODC and ODC-ova (respectively) both in Escherichia coli and in reticulocyte lysate. The plasmid encoding the fusion protein maltose-binding protein-antizyme (MBP-AZ) was constructed as follows. The rat full-length AZ cDNA in pET8 (kindly provided by Dr. Chaim Kahana) was isolated as an NcoI fragment and then treated with DNA polymerase Klenow fragment to produce blunt ends. The blunted,NcoI fragment was then ligated in frame in pMALTM (New England Biolabs Inc.) that had been digested with XbaI after end filling of the 5′-overhangs. A plasmid clone with the correct cDNA orientation was then selected. The resulting plasmid pMAL-AZ was used for expression of AZ in bacteria. Pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate was coupled to Affi-Gel 10-agarose (Bio-Rad) exactly as described previously (30Boucek R.J. Lembach K.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 184: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For expression of ODC and ODC-ova, pET-ODC and pET-ODCova (respectively) were transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). A culture (300 ml) was grown until absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6–0.8. Expression was then induced with 1-thio-γ-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm final concentration). After induction for 16 h at 22 °C, the cells were harvested and washed with ice-cold buffer L (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm DTT) supplemented with 10 mm iodoacetamide and 1:25 (w/v) solution of protease inhibitors. The cells were then resuspended in 20 ml of buffer L and lysed in a French pressure press cell (Aminco SLM Instruments, Inc., Urbana, IL). After lysis, the extract was supplemented with 5 mm DTT, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 15 min). The bacterial lysate (270 mg of protein) was loaded on a 4.5 × 1.6-cm Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer L. The column was washed with 20 ml of buffer L and then developed with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl (in buffer L). Both ODC and ODC-ova eluted from the column between 0.35 and 0.4 m NaCl. The peak fractions were combined and subjected to affinity chromatography. The combined protein fraction from the Q-Sepharose column was directly loaded on pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate-agarose column (1 × 7 cm) equilibrated in buffer L containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 0.1 mm l-ornithine. The sample was applied to the column at a flow rate of 35 μl/min (17 h) at 4 °C. The column was then washed with 80 ml of buffer L containing 15 mm NaCl. The protein was then eluted from the column by successive additions of 7-ml portions of buffer L containing 10 (μm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate. All of the bound protein that eluted in the first five fractions was combined and then concentrated to 0.5–2 μg/ml in Centricon 30 concentrator (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. For production of 35S-labeled ODC-ova in bacteria, pET-ODCova was transformed into the methionine auxotroph E. coli strain B834 (DE3) (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI). A 50-ml culture was grown at 37 °C in M9 minimal medium supplemented with thiamine (20 μg/ml) and all 20 amino acids at 0.2 mm until absorbance atA600 reached 0.6–0.7. 1-Thio-γ-d-galactopyranoside and Pro-mix L-[35S] (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (0.5 mCi) were then added for a further incubation at 22 °C for 16 h. Purification of 35S-labeled ODC-ova was then carried out exactly as described above. For expression of MBP-AZ, pMAL-AZ was transformed into E. coli strain DH10B. A bacterial culture (300 ml) was induced with 0.3 mm 1-thio-γ-d-galactopyranoside. After 2 h of induction at 37 °C, the cells were harvested and then washed with ice-cold buffer P (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmEDTA) supplemented with a 1:25 (v/v) solution of protease inhibitors. The cells were then resuspended in 20 ml of buffer P adjusted to 0.5m NaCl and lysed in a French pressure press cell. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 15 min), and the bacterial lysate was stored at −80 °C for further purification. A sample of the bacterial lysate (25 mg of protein) was applied to a 1-ml amylose resin. The column was then washed with buffer P, and MPB-AZ was eluted from the column by the sequential addition of 1-ml portions of buffer P containing 10 mm maltose. The first 2 ml that contained the bulk of the recombinant protein (approximately 1 mg) were combined and further purified by ion exchange chromatography. The affinity-purified protein from step 1 was diluted in 10 ml of buffer L (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm DTT) and loaded on a Mono-Q 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer L. The column was washed with buffer L containing 0.1 m NaCl and then developed with a linear gradient of 0.1–1.0 m NaCl in buffer L. MBP-AZ eluted from the column as a sharp protein peak at 0.4m NaCl. The protein was concentrated to 2 mg/ml in Centricon 30 and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. The Mono-Q-purified MBP-AZ was used in all of the experiments described in this study. Radiolabeled ODC-ova was produced from pET-ODC-ova that was incubated in a T7 polymerase-driven transcription-translation (TNT)-coupled system from reticulocyte lysate (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Following the translation reaction, unincorporated [35S]methionine was removed by ion exchange chromatography. The activity of the 26 S proteasome was determined by its ability to degrade radiolabeled ODC-ova produced in reticulocyte lysate. Degradation reaction mixtures contained the following components in a final volume of 25 μl: 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 1.25 unit of creatine phosphokinase, 35S-labeled ODC-ova (approximately 20,000 cpm), 2 μg of MBP-AZ, and purified 26 S proteasome as indicated. Incubation was for 10 min at 37 °C. Reactions were then stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid. Degradation was determined by measuring the amount of soluble radioactivity after the addition of trichloroacetic acid. One unit of 26 S proteasome was defined as the amount of enzyme that degraded 1% of 35S-labeled ODC-ova in 1 min under the conditions specified above. All purification procedures were performed at 4 °C. The 26 S proteasome complex was prepared from livers of C57Bl mice (10–13 weeks old). A typical preparation was from 10 livers. The livers were thoroughly washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then homogenized using a motor-driven Potter-Elvehjem Teflon tissue grinder. Homogenization was in 5 ml/liver of buffer A containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm ATP, and 0.25 m sucrose. The crude extract was then subjected to fractional centrifugation at 1000 × g and then at 10,000 × g. The 10,000 × gsupernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 70,000 × g. The resulting supernatant (lysate) was then subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation. This procedure separates 26 from 20 S proteasome. The lysate containing approximately 250 mg of protein was supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 10 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase and was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The proteasome complex was then precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 38% (w/v) saturation as described previously (4Eytan E. Ganoth D. Armon T. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7751-7755Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The 38% ammonium sulfate sediment was dissolved in buffer B containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. The sample was loaded onto a Sepharose 6B fast flow column (2.5 × 40 cm) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer B. Fractions (2 ml) were collected, and 26 S proteasome activity was assayed in 2-μl samples of column fractions. The proteasome peak from step 3 was combined and loaded onto a 1 × 4-cm Resource-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer B. The column was then washed with 10 ml of buffer B and developed by a linear gradient from 0 to 0.8 m NaCl in buffer B over 50 ml. The 26 S proteasome eluted from the column between 0.35 and 0.4m salt. The 26 S proteasome complex from the ion exchange column was concentrated to 250 μl by ultrafiltration in a Centricon 30 (Amicon). The sample was loaded on a 10–40% (v/v) glycerol gradient in buffer B (11.5 ml in a 14 × 95-mm tube). After centrifugation at 28,000 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C, fractions of 0.4 ml were collected, and 26 S proteasome activity was assayed in 1-μl samples. The proteasome peak was stored in aliquots at −80 °C. This final 26 S proteasome preparation was used in all of the experiments described in this study. The 20 S proteasome and PA700 complex were purified from bovine erythrocytes as described previously (31McGuire M.J. McCullough M.L. Croal D.E. DeMartino G.N. Biochim. Biophys.

PA28α in the plasmid pET16b was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and then purified as described previously (33Song X. von Kampen J. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27994-28000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Peptidase activity of 20 and 26 S proteasome was assayed using the fluorogenic peptide sLLVY-MCA as described previously (34Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16890-16895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze proteasome complexes, these complexes were separated on 4% nondenaturing PAGE. Proteasome peptidase activity was then assayed by overlaying the gels with buffer containing 40 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm DTT, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 100 μl of sLLVY-MCA. Incubation was at 37 °C for 10–30 min. The fluorescent gels were then transluminated by UV light and photographed as described (35Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22362-22368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out as described above in a final volume of 250 μl containing the following components: 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 12.5 units of creatine phosphokinase, 5 μm bestatin, a 1:25 (v/v) solution of protease inhibitors, 4 μg of ODC-ova (or35S-labeled ODC-ova), 26 μg of MBP-AZ, and 20 units of 26 S proteasome. Following incubation at 37 °C for various time periods as indicated, the reaction mixture was adjusted to pH 2 by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid and then sonicated for 30 s at full power in a bath sonicator. The acid extract was microcentrifuged in an Amicon Microcon 10 microconcentrator (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The filtrate was collected and lyophilized. The lyophilized low molecular weight material from step 2 was then separated on a 2.1 × 150-mm C18 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) (eluant A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 4% acetonitrile; eluant B, 0.085 trifluoroacetic acid, 90% acetonitrile; gradient 4–50% B in 45 min; flow rate of 0.2 ml/min). Based on the position of elution of the synthetic SIINFEKL that eluted reproducibly between 33 and 34% B, the material eluting between 31 and 36% B was routinely pooled and tested for biological activity. The combined peptide fraction from step 2 was incubated with RMA/S cells (45Ljunggren H.G. Stam N.J. Ohlen C. Neefjes J.J. Hoglund P. Heemels M.T. Schumacher T.N. Townsend A. Karre K.

The molecular mechanism of this inhibition remains to be elucidated. We employed a simian virus 40 (SV40) based in vitro DNA replication assay to study biochemical aspects of this inhibition. We report here that the reduced DNA replication activity in extracts of DDIA-treated cells is partly caused by a reduction in the amount of replication protein A (RPA). We also report that the dominant inhibitory effect is caused by the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) which inactivates SV40 T antigen (TAg) by phosphorylation.

Although this response was first observed several decades ago, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown but ATM is thought to play an important role. More recently, evidence has been presented suggesting that the inhibition observed in DNA replication in response to DDIA is equivalent to the activation of a checkpoint in the S-phase and that it requires in yeast the products of MEC1 and RAD53genes, homologues of ATM and Chk2, respectively (3Paulovich A.G.

It is important to establish the mechanisms of regulation of DNA replication after DNA damage and the biochemical functions of the above genes in the process. We investigated the regulation of DNA replication after DNA damage using a simian virus 40 (SV40) based in vitro DNA replication assay, and have shown that extracts of cells exposed to DDIA have reduced activity for in vitro DNA replication and inhibit, in a dominant fashion, the ability of extracts from nontreated cells to promote in vitro DNA replication (7Wang Y.

We have reported that the degree of inhibition of DNA replication in cells exposed either to x-rays or CPT is comparable with that measured in vitro using extracts prepared from cells exposed to these agents (7Wang Y.

We subsequently focused on the molecular characterization of this inhibition. In the present study, we provide evidence that following DNA damage two processes contribute to the inhibition of in vitro DNA replication: reduced availability of replication protein A (RPA) and activation of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONRPA, a ssDNA-binding protein, is a heterotrimeric complex with subunits of 70, 34, and 14 kDa required in the initiation stages ofin vitro DNA replication and for multiple other processes of DNA metabolism (17Fairman M.P. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1989; 7: 1211-1218Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 18Wold M.S. Kelly T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 7: 2523-2527Crossref Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 19Coverley D.

A. 1989; 86: 9757-9761Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To test whether RPA plays a role in the inhibition of DNA replication in the in vitro DNA replication assay, we measured, by immunoblotting, its abundance in the extracts of cells treated with radiation or CPT. The amount of RPA p70, the subunit responsible for ssDNA binding, was reduced by approximately 50% (Fig. 1a,top). In line with a reduction in RPA p70, the binding activity of RPA to ssDNA was also reduced by about 50% in the same extracts (Fig. 1a, bottom, lanes 4 and 5). Post-translational modifications of RPA p34 have been implicated in cell cycle regulation and S-phase checkpoint activation (21Din S.J. Brill S.J. Fairman M.P. Still B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 22Liu V.F. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7222-7231Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We observed phosphorylation of RPA p34 (8Wang Y. Perrault A.R. Iliakis G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1654-1659PubMed Google Scholar), but could not establish alterations in the level of this subunit after DNA damage, probably due to the presence of a form not associated with the RPA holoenzyme (23Kenny M.K. Schlegel U. Furneaux H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7693-7700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A monoclonal anti-RPA p70 antibody slowed the mobility of the DNA-protein complex in reactions assembled using cell extracts, as well as in reactions assembled with rRPA (Fig. 1b,lanes 2 and 4), confirming that the ssDNA binding protein is RPA. The amount of RPA p70 in the whole cell lysates of treated cells was similar to that of nontreated cells (data not shown). Therefore, we hypothesized that RPA may bind to DNA damage sites after exposure of cells to DDIA and be retained in the nucleus during extract preparation, reducing thus its level in the cytoplasmic component. In support of this hypothesis, addition of dsDNA fragments reduced RPA binding to ssDNA (Fig. 1c). It is possible that competition for RPA between damage sites and replication sites contributes to the inhibition of DNA replication in DDIA-treated cells.Although the amount of RPA was reduced in extracts from DDIA-treated HeLa cells, addition of rRPA could not recover DNA replication activity (Fig. 1d, compare lanes 7 and 8). Also, a small amount of such extracts mixed with control extracts strongly inhibited DNA replication (Fig. 1d, comparelanes 1 and 6). We discovered that the inhibition of DNA replication could be reversed when extracts of DDIA-treated HeLa cells were preincubated with wortmannin, a nonspecific inhibitor of protein kinases, and were supplemented with RPA (Fig. 1d,lane 10). A similar reversion of DNA replication inhibition was also observed when extracts of DDIA-treated cells were preincubated with wortmannin and mixed with control extracts (Fig. 1d,lane 11). Thus, the reduction in DNA replication activity observed in cytoplasmic extracts of cells exposed to ionizing radiation or CPT is the combined result of a reduction in RPA activity and an activation of a wortmannin-sensitive kinase. Other factors essential for in vitro SV40 DNA replication remain practically unaffected in such extracts.As mentioned above, dsDNA fragments could reduce RPA binding to ssDNA. We examined whether addition of dsDNA fragments to extracts of nontreated cells could simulate some of the characteristics of inhibition observed in extracts of treated cells. The presence of dsDNA fragments in the extracts of nontreated cells inhibited DNA replication in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2a, HeLa), and the inhibition reached a plateau at 50 ng (Fig. 2a,HeLa). Addition of rRPA relieved somewhat the observed inhibition, but the effect was relatively small (Fig. 2a,HeLa, and Fig. 2b, lane 7). Pretreatment of extracts with wortmannin did not affect the inhibition caused by 50 ng of dsDNA (Fig. 2b, lane 6). However, addition of rRPA to wortmannin-pretreated extracts completely reversed DNA replication inhibition (Fig. 2b, lane 8). Thus, dsDNA fragments inhibit in vitro DNA replication via a mechanism similar to that identified for extracts of cells exposed to radiation or CPT, i.e. by sequestering RPA and by activating a wortmannin-sensitive kinase. In subsequent experiments, dsDNA fragments were added to the extracts of untreated cells to mimic the DNA damage effect.Figure 2Effect of wortmannin and RPA on dsDNA-induced inhibition of in vitro DNA replication in reactions assembled with extracts of untreated cells. a, extracts of HeLa (○, ●) or MO59J (▿, ▾) cells were preincubated with different amounts of dsDNA fragments for 10 min at 30 °C and were then added to the reaction mixture without (○, ▿) or with 2 μg of rRPA (●, ▾) for in vitro DNA replication. The results have been normalized to the replication activity measured in reactions assembled in the absence of dsDNA fragments. b, the products of in vitro DNA replication in reactions assembled with HeLa cell extracts in the presence or absence of 50 ng of dsDNA fragments. The effect of rRPA and wortmannin on DNA replication activity is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The inhibition of DNA replication after DNA damage is thought of as an active process that favors DNA repair. To identify the target of wortmannin in the extracts from DDIA-treated cells, we tested DNA replication activity in extracts of repair-deficient cell lines. MO59J cells are deficient in dsDNA break rejoining and sensitive to ionizing radiation-induced cell killing (24Allalunis-Turner M.J. Barron G.M. Day R.S. Dobler K.D. Mirzayans R. Radiat. Res. 1993; 134: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We found that when MO59J cell extracts were supplemented with DNA fragments, both RPA binding to ssDNA (Fig. 1c, MO59J) and in vitroDNA replication (Fig. 2a, MO59J) were reduced to a degree similar to that observed in HeLa cell extracts. However, contrary to the results with the extracts of HeLa cells, RPA alone completely reversed this inhibition (Fig. 2a,MO59J, and Fig. 3a). These results indicated that the wortmannin-sensitive protein kinase was absent from MO59J cell extracts.Figure 3Effect of DNA-PK on in vitroDNA replication. a, the products of in vitro DNA replication in reactions assembled with MO59J cell extracts in the presence of 50 ng of dsDNA fragments. b, DNA-PK activity in extracts of HeLa or MO59J cells (C,CPT, R, and C+ dsDNA: control extracts plus 100 ng of DNA fragments). The DNA-PK activity is expressed as picomoles of [γ-32P]ATP transferred to the substrate peptide/minute/milligram of protein. Data are the average from three independent experiments. c, 150 μg of MO59J cell extracts were preincubated with 100 ng of dsDNA fragments in the presence of 40 units of DNA-PK (Promega), at 30 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, 20 μm wortmannin was added, and the mixture used to assemble DNA replication reactions was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of 2 μg of rRPA. Data are the average from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It has been reported that MO59J cells lack any detectable DNA-PK activity (25Lees-Miller S.P. Godbout R. Chan D.W. Weinfeld M. Day III, R.S. Barron G.M. Allalunis-Turner J. Science. 1995; 267: 1183-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) and have a low expression of ATM (26Gately D.P. Hittle J.C. Chan G.K.T. Yen T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2361-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It is well known that AT cells show reduced inhibition of DNA replication after DNA damage (27Painter R.B. Young B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7315-7317Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). At the concentration used (20 μm), wortmannin inhibits both DNA-PK and ATM kinase. To examine whether wortmannin acts in MO59J cell extracts by inhibiting ATM or by inhibiting DNA-PK, we prepared extracts from AT cells and performed experiments similar to those outlined with M059J cell extracts. Unexpectedly, restoration of DNA replication in AT cell extracts after addition of DNA fragments required both RPA and wortmannin, indicating that the inhibitory mechanism of in vitro DNA replication does not utilize ATM (data not shown). We measured, therefore, the DNA-PK activity in the extracts of DDIA-treated HeLa cells. The DNA-PK activity was higher in the extracts of treated HeLa cells than in control extracts when no activating dsDNA was added to the reactions (Fig. 3b, in control buffer). Importantly, addition of purified DNA-PK to M059J cell extracts supplemented with DNA fragments re-established the wortmannin requirement for the restoration of DNA replication activity (Fig. 3c). These results identify the wortmannin-sensitive kinase that inhibits DNA in vitroreplication as DNA-PK.DNA-PK (28Carter T. Vancurová I. Sun I. Lou W. DeLeon S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6460-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 29Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.-R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) is a serine/threonine kinase consisting of a 465-kDa catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and a heterodimeric regulatory complex termed Ku. As targets of DNA-PK we considered two essential factors forin vitro SV40 DNA replication: RPA and TAg. Both proteins are known to be phosphorylated by DNA-PK and have been implicated in regulatory steps of DNA replication (29Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.-R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 30Brush G.S. Anderson C.W. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12520-12524Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To investigate whether RPA or TAg contribute to the inhibition of DNA replication observed in extracts of DDIA-treated HeLa cells, we separately preincubated these proteins with a small amount of extract from treated HeLa cells to allow for possible post-translational modifications. The mixture was then used to assemble reactions with extracts of nontreated cells. Wortmannin was added to these reactions after the end of the preincubation period to neutralize the inhibitory effect of the treated cell extract that accompanied RPA or TAg. The results indicated that this preincubation did not alter RPA activity (data not shown), but dramatically reduced TAg activity for DNA replication (Fig. 4a). To further confirm that the modulation of RPA by DNA-PK has no effect on the DNA replication activity, we used a mutant RPA with a deletion in the N-terminal domain of RPA p34. The deletion removes DNA-PK phosphorylation sites without affecting the activity of the enzyme for in vitro DNA replication (31Lee S.-K. Kim D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12801-12807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 32Henricksen L.A. Carter T. Dutta A. Wold M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3107-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The effect of this mutant protein (data not shown) on DNA replication was practically identical to the effect of the wild type protein. This suggests that phosphorylation of RPA by DNA-PK does not modify its activity in supporting DNA replication in extracts of either treated or nontreated cells. Despite the fact thatin vitro observations suggest no role for phosphorylated RPA in the regulation of DNA replication after DNA damage, the possibility that this form of RPA plays a role in vivo should be left open.Figure 4Effect of DNA-PK on SV40 TAg . a, 75 μg of HeLa cell extract (C, CPT,R, and C+ dsDNA) were preincubated with 0.5 μg of TAg at 30 °C for 10 min in half-strength DNA-PK sample buffer (Promega) in the presence of 5 mm ATP. Subsequently, wortmannin was added (20 μm), and the mixture in the presence of 100 μg of extracts from untreated HeLa cells was assembled DNA replication reactions at 37 °C for 1 h. Data are the average from three independent experiments. b, different amounts of DNA-PK (Promega) were preincubated with TAg at 30 °C as in a in the presence of 50 ng of dsDNA fragments for 10 min. Subsequently, wortmannin was added (20 μm), and the mixture was assembled DNA replication reactions in the presence of 150 μg of extracts from untreated HeLa cells without (○) or with (●) 1 μg of additional TAg at 37 °C for 1 h. c, effect of ori+ DNA on the phosphorylation of TAg by DNA-PK. TAg was incubated with purified DNA-PK with or without ori+ DNA as described in b but with [γ–32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 μCi/μl, 0.05 μl/sample) and 0.25 mm cold ATP. Top, autoradiograph of TAg phosphorylated by DNA-PK.Bottom, phosphorylation activity of TAg calculated in picomoles ATP/minute/20 units of DNA-PK. Data are the average from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that the modification of TAg in extracts of treated HeLa cells was mediated by DNA-PK, we preincubated TAg with purified DNA-PK. The in vitro DNA replication activity decreased dramatically in reactions assembled using TAg preincubated with DNA-PK, and this inhibition could be completely reversed by nontreated TAg (Fig. 4b). Addition of [γ-32P]ATP during the preincubation period confirmed phosphorylation of TAg by DNA-PK (Fig. 4c). Phosphorylation and inactivation of TAg for DNA replication was inhibited by the presence of ori+ DNA in the preincubation reaction (Fig. 4c), suggesting that binding of TAg to the replication origin reduced the phosphorylation of TAg and thus its inactivation.The results presented here provide evidence that following DNA damage two processes contribute to the inhibition of in vitro DNA replication: reduced availability of RPA and activation of DNA-PK. Similar processes may also be involved and partly regulate cellular or viral DNA replication in vivo after exposure of cells to DDIA. DNA-PK may inhibit DNA replication by phosphorylating functional homologues of TAg. Recruitment of RPA to DNA damage sites may contribute to this down-regulation. The latter pathway may explain the inhibition of DNA replication in irradiated MO59J cells, which is found to be similar to that observed in cell lines with normal DNA-PK activity (24Allalunis-Turner M.J. Barron G.M. Day R.S. Dobler K.D. Mirzayans R. Radiat. Res. 1993; 134: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 2a support this hypothesis.There is strong evidence that severe combined immunodeficiency mice have greatly reduced DNA-PK activity (33Peterson S.R. Kurimasa A. Oshimura M.

Recently it has been reported that DNA-PK may play a role in tumor suppression (36Kurimasa A. Ouyang H. Dong L.-J. Wang S. Li X. Cordon-Cardo C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1403-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Here, we report yet another function of DNA-PK: the regulation DNA replication after DNA damage. Although our results did not implicate ATM in the inhibition of in vitro DNA replication following DNA damage, the evidence for an important role of this kinase in the regulation of DNA replication in vivo is overwhelming and suggests that multiple processes regulate DNA replication after DNA damage. The in vitro assay allowed us to study one specific aspect of this regulation. Inhibition of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells is one of the earliest effects of radiation to be reported.

It has been documented that a major component of this inhibition derives from a delay in the initiation of unreplicated origins (1Watanabe I. Radiat. Res. 1974; 58: 541-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 2Painter R.B. Young B.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 418: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although this response was first observed several decades ago, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown but ATM is thought to play an important role. More recently, evidence has been presented suggesting that the inhibition observed in DNA replication in response to DDIA is equivalent to the activation of a checkpoint in the S-phase and that it requires in yeast the products of MEC1 and RAD53genes, homologues of ATM and Chk2, respectively (3Paulovich A.G.

It is important to establish the mechanisms of regulation of DNA replication after DNA damage and the biochemical functions of the above genes in the process. We investigated the regulation of DNA replication after DNA damage using a simian virus 40 (SV40) based in vitro DNA replication assay, and have shown that extracts of cells exposed to DDIA have reduced activity for in vitro DNA replication and inhibit, in a dominant fashion, the ability of extracts from nontreated cells to promote in vitro DNA replication (7Wang Y.

In the SV40-based DNA replication assay, replication of plasmids containing the SV40 origin of DNA (ori+ DNA) replication is accomplished in vitro with either crude cytoplasmic extracts or proteins purified from such extracts with SV40 T antigen (TAg) as the only noncellular protein (9Li J.J.

https://openalex.org/W2063938245,"We have previously shown that porcine aortic endothelial cells expressing the Y934F platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) β-receptor mutant respond to PDGF-BB in a chemotaxis assay at about 100-fold lower concentration than do wild-type PDGF β-receptor-expressing cells (Hansen, K., Johnell, M., Siegbahn, A., Rorsman, C., Engström, U., Wernstedt, C., Heldin, C.-H., and Rönnstrand, L.

By two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping, the increase in phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 was shown not to be selective for any site, rather a general increase in phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 was seen. Specific inhibitors of protein kinase C, bisindolylmaleimide (GF109203X), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), LY294002, did not affect the activation of PLC-γ1. To assess whether increased activation of PLC-γ1 is the cause of the hyperchemotactic behavior of the Y934F mutant cell line, we constructed cell lines expressing either wild-type or a catalytically compromised version of PLC-γ1 under a tetracycline-inducible promoter. Overexpression and concomitant increased activation of wild-type PLC-γ1 in response to PDGF-BB led to a hyperchemotactic behavior of the cells, while the catalytically compromised PLC-γ1 mutant had no effect on PDGF-BB-induced chemotaxis. Furthermore, in cells expressing normal levels of PLC-γ1, chemotaxis was inhibited by LY294002. In contrast, the increase in chemotactic response seen upon overexpression of PLC-γ1 was not inhibited by the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002.

Östman A. Rönnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar). PDGF is a family of dimeric isoforms consisting of different combinations of disulfide-bonded A- and B-chains. Thus, three isoforms of PDGF exist with distinct binding characteristics toward the structurally related PDGF α- and β-receptors. Binding of PDGF to its receptors leads to dimerization of the receptors, an essential event in PDGF receptor activation (2Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar, 3Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dimerization leads to autophosphorylation on a number of tyrosine residues in the intracellular part of the receptors, providing docking sites for a class of signal transduction molecules containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, including members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), the GTPase activating protein of Ras (GAP), and phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) (1Heldin C.-H. Östman A. Rönnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to undergoing autophosphorylation, the PDGF β-receptor is also phosphorylated on one specific tyrosine residue by members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. Autophosphorylation of the PDGF β-receptor in the juxtamembrane region leads to association, phosphorylation, and activation of c-Src (4Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 481-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) and to a subsequent phosphorylation by Src of Tyr934 in the receptor (5Hansen K. Johnell M. Siegbahn A. Rorsman C. Engström U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.-H. Rönnstrand L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5299-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Mutation of Tyr934 to a phenylalanine residue and expression of the mutant receptor in porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells revealed an increased chemotactic response compared with cells expressing the wild-type PDGF β-receptor (5Hansen K. Johnell M. Siegbahn A. Rorsman C. Engström U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.-H. Rönnstrand L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5299-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Blocking the association of the p85α subunit of PI3-kinase with the PDGF β-receptor, through mutation of Tyr740 and Tyr751 to phenylalanine residues, led to a significant reduction of the chemotactic response in response to PDGF-BB (6Wennström S. Siegbahn A. Yokote K. Arvidsson A.-K. Heldin C.-H. Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar), which together with the observation that PDGF-induced chemotaxis is strongly inhibited by the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (5Hansen K. Johnell M. Siegbahn A. Rorsman C. Engström U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.-H. Rönnstrand L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5299-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) suggests a role for PI3-kinase in mediating a chemotactic response to PDGF-BB. The present study was undertaken to investigate the mechanisms behind the increased chemotactic response in the Y934F mutant cell line. We present data here that phosphorylation and activation of PLC-γ1 are considerably increased in the Y934F mutant receptor cell line. Furthermore, by the use of cell lines expressing either wild-type or a catalytically compromised mutant of PLC-γ1 under the tetracycline-inducible promoter, we could show that the lipase activity of PLC-γ1 is essential for the hyperchemotactic response and that cells overexpressing PLC-γ1 are independent of PI3-kinase for PDGF-induced chemotaxis. Precoated cellulose thin layer chromatography plates were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), modified sequencing grade trypsin from Promega (Madison, WI). Polyvinylpyrrolidone was from Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). Radionuclides were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, UK). The Hunter thin layer electrophoresis system was from C.B.S. Scientific Co. (Del Mar, CA). LY294002 was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Rabbit antiserum against PLC-γ1 was generated by immunizing rabbits with a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of bovine PLC-γ1 (7Arteaga C.L. Johnson M.D. Todderud G. Coffey R.J. Carpenter G. Page D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10435-10439Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). An antiserum against the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag was raised by immunizing a rabbit with the synthetic peptide YPYDVPDYAGYPYDVPDYA conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). PAE cells expressing the PDGF β-receptor were stably transfected by electroporation with the regulatory plasmid pUHD 172–1-neo (8Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Müller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). G-418-resistant clones were screened by transient transfection with the luciferase reporter plasmid pUHC 13–3 and tested for luciferase activity in the presence or absence of doxycycline. Clones with low background expression of luciferase and high inducibility in the presence of doxycycline were chosen for transfection with the reporter plasmid pUHD 10–3 containing either wild-type PLC-γ1 or a lipase inactive PLC-γ1 (H335F/H380F), each containing a carboxyl-terminal HA-tag. Plasmids were co-transfected with pPKGpuro, providing puromycin as selection marker. Puromycin-resistant clones were screened by Western blotting for expression of PLC-γ1 in the presence or absence of doxycycline, using either anti-PLC-γ1 antiserum or an anti-HA-tag antiserum. The clone used expressing wild-type PDGF β-receptor and wild-type PLC-γ1 is thus denoted PAE/wtβ/PLC-γ1wt, whereas the clone expressing wild-type PDGF-β-receptor and lipase compromised PLC-γ1 is denoted PAE/wtβ/PLC-γ1mut. Six-well plates with semi-confluent cultures of PAE/wtβ/PLC-γ1wt or PAE/wtβ/PLC-γ1mut cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 20 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h to induce protein expression, followed by overnight incubation with 2 μCi ofmyo-[3H]inositol in 2 ml of inositol-free Ham's F-12, containing 0.3% fetal calf serum. In cases where bisindolylmaleimide or LY294002 were used, inhibitors were added to the medium 60 min before stimulation with PDGF-BB. Assay for PDGF-induced release of inositol phosphates was performed essentially according to Eriksson et al. (9Eriksson A. Nånberg E. Rönnstrand L. Engström U. Hellman U. Rupp E. Carpenter G. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7773-7781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at subconfluency 2 days before the experiment and starved for 24 h in 0.2% fetal calf serum. Cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate essentially as described by Hansen et al. (5Hansen K. Johnell M. Siegbahn A. Rorsman C. Engström U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.-H. Rönnstrand L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5299-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, using an 8% gel and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C Extra, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples were processed for tryptic digestion, two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping, and phosphoamino acid analysis, as described by Blume-Jensen et al. (10Blume-Jensen P. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.-H. Rönnstrand L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14192-14200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The chemotactic response of the different cell lines was assayed by means of the leading front technique in a modified Boyden chamber, as described previously (11Siegbahn A. Hammacher A. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In experiments where the effects of different inhibitors on the motility response were tested, the cells were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C with the inhibitor at the indicated concentrations before the experiment. The inhibitors were present throughout the experiment. In cases when doxycycline-induced protein expression was used, cells were incubated with 10 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h before the chemotaxis assay was performed. The chemotaxis assays were performed in Ham's F-12, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. PAE/wtβ/PLC-γ1wt and PAE/wtβ/PLC-γ1mut cells were grown to confluency in 12-well plates and starved for 24 h in Ham's F-12 containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, in the presence or absence of 20 ng/ml doxycycline to induce protein expression. Medium was changed to the above medium containing 0.2 μg/ml [3H]thymidine and varying concentrations of PDGF-BB. Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, after which cells were fixed with trichloroacetic acid and precipitated radioactivity was quantitated in a scintillation counter. We have previously shown that cells expressing a PDGF β-receptor with Tyr934 mutated to a phenylalanine residue, show enhanced chemotactic response compared with wild-type receptor-expressing cells (5Hansen K. Johnell M. Siegbahn A. Rorsman C. Engström U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.-H. Rönnstrand L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5299-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 in response to PDGF-BB was increased in cells expressing the Y934F mutant receptor. To assess whether the increase in phosphorylation was selective for a particular tyrosine residue, and whether additional phosphorylation sites appeared in cells expressing the Y934F mutant, cells expressing the wild-type PDGF β-receptor and the Y934F mutant receptor were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Following stimulation with PDGF-BB, cells were lysed and PLC-γ1 immunoprecipitated and processed for two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. A general increase in the intensity of peptides phosphorylated in response to PDGF-BB could be seen in the Y934F mutant cell line, compared with cells expressing the wild-type PDGF β-receptor (Fig. 1). Several peptides containing phosphotyrosine, as well as phosphoserine, appeared in response to PDGF-BB stimulation (data not shown). No selective increase in the phosphorylation of any peptide, nor any new phosphopeptides, were seen in PLC-γ1 from Y934F mutant cells. Previously, we have shown that the increased chemotactic response seen in the Y934F mutant receptor cell line could be inhibited by bisindolylmaleimide, a protein kinase C inhibitor, while leaving the wild-type receptor-induced chemotactic response virtually unaffected. In contrast, an inhibitor of PI3-kinase, LY294002, effectively inhibited the chemotactic response seen in wild-type receptor-expressing cells, with little effect on the chemotactic response elicited by the Y934F mutant receptor (5Hansen K. Johnell M. Siegbahn A. Rorsman C. Engström U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.-H. Rönnstrand L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5299-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effect of bisindolylmaleimide and LY294002 on PLC-γ1 activity in the two cell lines. Cells were labeled with [3H]myoinositol, incubated with the respective inhibitors, followed by stimulation with PDGF-BB and analysis of produced IP3 (Fig. 2). The inhibitor of protein kinase C, bisindolylmaleimide, showed no effect on PLC-γ1 activity, neither in wild-type receptor cells nor in the Y934F mutant cells, whereas the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 slightly inhibited the PLC-γ1 activity in both cell lines. In order to investigate whether increased PLC-γ1 activity causes increased chemotaxis and thus could explain the hyperchemotactic phenotype of the Y934F mutant cell line, wild-type PDGF β-receptor-expressing cells were transfected with wild-type or catalytically compromised HA-tagged human PLC-γ1 under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. Cell clones were analyzed for expression of PLC-γ1 in the presence or absence of doxycycline. Conditions were optimized so that the expression level of PLC-γ1 would lead to a response in IP3 release after PDGF-BB stimulation similar to that seen in the Y934F cells (Fig. 3). The clones used expressed a negligible amount of HA-tagged protein in the absence of doxycycline, while the protein expression was dramatically induced by doxycycline (Fig. 4).Figure 4Doxycycline induced expression of PLC-γ1 in the PAE/wtβ/PLC-γ1wtand PAE/wtβ/PLC-γ1mutcell lines. Cells were left untreated or induced to express proteins with 10 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis, followed by electrotransfer to Immobilon-P filters. Filters were probed with either anti-PLC-γ1 antiserum or anti-HA antiserum. IB, immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Expression of PLC-γ1 was induced with doxycycline for 24 h. Cells were then assayed for chemotaxis by means of the leading front technique in a modified Boyden chamber. In accordance with the Y934F mutant cells, PDGF β-receptor cells overexpressing wild-type PLC-γ1 responded to PDGF-BB with chemotaxis at concentrations almost 100-fold lower compared with control cells without induction of PLC-γ1 expression (Fig. 5A). In contrast, cells overexpressing a similar amount of a catalytically compromised version of PLC-γ1, in which two histidine residues (His335 and His380) in the catalytic domain had been mutated to phenylalanine residues, had exactly the same chemotactic response as control cells (Fig. 5B). Chemotaxis induced by PDGF-BB in wild-type PDGF β-receptor-expressing PAE cells is efficiently inhibited by LY294002 (1Heldin C.-H. Östman A. Rönnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, chemotaxis was inhibited by LY294002 in the absence of doxycycline in cells expressing wild-type PLC-γ1 under a tetracycline-inducible promoter. In contrast, when cells were incubated with doxycycline to induce overexpression of PLC-γ1, the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 had no effect on PDGF-BB-induced chemotaxis (Fig. 6A). In contrast, when cells expressing a dominant negative H335F/H380F mutant of PLC-γ1 under a tetracycline-inducible promoter were incubated with doxycycline, the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 effectively inhibited PDGF-BB-induced chemotaxis (Fig. 6B). Thus, the lipase activity of PLC-γ1 is necessary to allow cells to migrate in the presence of PI3-kinase inhibitor. In order to assess the possible role of PLC-γ1 in mediating the mitogenic response to PDGF-BB, cells were incubated with doxycycline for 24 h to induce overexpression of either wild-type PLC-γ1 or catalytically compromised PLC-γ1, followed by stimulation with varying concentrations of PDGF-BB and incubation with [3H]thymidine for 24 h. However, no effect was seen on PDGF-BB-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation in cells expressing the wild-type or the catalytically compromised PLC-γ1 (Fig. 7,A and B). We have previously shown that c-Src phosphorylates Tyr934 in the second part of the kinase domain of the PDGF β-receptor (5Hansen K. Johnell M. Siegbahn A. Rorsman C. Engström U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.-H. Rönnstrand L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5299-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with a PDGF β-receptor mutant with Tyr934 replaced with a phenylalanine residue showed an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 and an enhanced chemotactic response to PDGF-BB. We have now further shown that the enhanced chemotaxis coincides with an increase in phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 on the same sites as those phosphorylated in response to activation of the wild-type PDGF β-receptor. Kim et al.(12Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) have shown that phosphorylation of Tyr771 and Tyr783 in PLC-γ1 are essential for activation. No change in the stoichiometry in phosphorylation of Tyr1021, the primary association site for PLC-γ1 in the PDGF β-receptor, was seen in cells expressing the Y934F mutant compared with cells expressing wild-type PDGF β-receptor (data not shown). The reason for the increased phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 in cells expressing the Y934F mutant PDGF β-receptor is not known; it is possible that the receptor kinase in the Y934F mutant has altered kinetics toward PLC-γ1 as a substrate. An additional possibility is that the increase in phosphorylation of PLC-γ1, at least in part, could be due to the action of c-Src since it has been shown that c-Src is able to associate with and phosphorylate PLC-γ1 (13Liao F. Shin H.S. Rhee S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Nakanishi O. Shibasaki F. Hidaka M. Homma Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10754-10759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the increased phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 correlated with an increase in IP3 production (Fig. 2). The magnitude of IP3production produced in the Y934F mutant cell line was about 3-fold higher than in wild-type receptor-expressing cells. The difference in response is not due to differences in receptor number or ligand affinity between the cell lines, as indicated by Scatchard analyses of PDGF-BB binding (1Heldin C.-H. Östman A. Rönnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of PLC-γ1 in chemotactic signaling was pointed out by Kundra et al. (15Kundra V. Escobedo J.A. Kazlauskas A. Kim H.K. Rhee S.G. Williams L.T. Zetter B.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 474-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 16Kundra V. Soker S. Zetter B.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1429-1435PubMed Google Scholar). However, PAE cells expressing a PDGF β-receptor mutant, with the association site for PLC-γ1 Tyr1021 mutated to a phenylalanine residue, showed unaffected chemotaxis toward the ligand (6Wennström S. Siegbahn A. Yokote K. Arvidsson A.-K. Heldin C.-H. Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, Wennström et al. (6Wennström S. Siegbahn A. Yokote K. Arvidsson A.-K. Heldin C.-H. Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that inhibition of PI3-kinase with wortmannin in PAE cells expressing PDGF β-receptors led to inhibited chemotaxis. In contrast, Higaki et al. (17Higaki M. Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Shimokado K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29342-29346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) showed that, in vascular smooth muscle cells and Swiss 3T3 cells, inhibition of PI3-kinase had no effect on chemotaxis. The chemotactic response seen in the Y934F mutant cell line was, in contrast to the response seen in the wild-type PDGF β-receptor-expressing cells, inhibited by bisindolylmaleimide, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, but resistant to inhibition by the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (1Heldin C.-H. Östman A. Rönnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that overexpression and enhanced activation of PLC-γ1 also results in enhanced chemotactic response and that, under these conditions, the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 has no effect on the chemotaxis induced by PDGF-BB. Taken together, these data suggest that at least two pathways can mediate PDGF β-receptor-induced chemotaxis,i.e. PI3-kinase and PLC-γ1. It is possible that the expression levels of PI3-kinase and PLC-γ1, and their magnitude of activation, determines which of these pathways will dominate. Activation of PLC-γ1 leads to production of two second messengers, IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG). Binding of IP3 to receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum leads to release of calcium, while DAG is an activator of the classical PKCs (18Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Furthermore, DAG has been implicated in stimulation of chemotaxis in lymphocytes (19Boonen G.J.J.C. de Koster B.M. VanSteveninck J. Elferink J.G.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,20Wright T.M. Hoffman R.D. Nishijima J. Jakoi L. Snyderman R. Shin H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1869-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We could not detect any effect of the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide on PLC-γ1 activity, neither in wild-type cells, nor in the mutant cell line (Fig. 2). This is in contrast to findings by Ozawa et al. (21Ozawa K. Yamada K. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2280-2283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who described feedback inhibition of PLC-γ1 by PKC-α and PKC-ε in rat basophil RBL-2H3 cells. The PI3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, had a slight reducing effect on PLC-γ1 activity. This is consistent with findings that full activation of PLC-γ1 requires binding of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate to its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (22Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 23Rameh L.E. Rhee S.G. Spokes K. Kazlauskas A. Cantley L.C. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23750-23757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), an event that triggers translocation to the membrane. In conclusion, the inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide and LY294002 are likely to act downstream rather than upstream of PLC-γ1 in the signaling pathways leading to chemotaxis. The essential role of PLC-γ1 in mammalian growth and development was shown in mice with a targeted deletion of the PLC-γ1 locus. This deletion results in embryonic lethality at approximately day 9.0 of embryonic development (24Ji Q.-S. Winnier G.E. Niswender K.D. Horstman D. Wisdom R. Magnuson M.A. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The exact role of PLC-γ1 in mitogenesis is debated. Smith et al. (28Bae Y.S. Cantley L.G. Chen C.S. Kim S.R. Kwon K.S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4465-4469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and Huang et al.(29Derman M.P. Toker A. Hartwig J.H. Spokes K. Falck J.R. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6465-6470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) showed that microinjection of wild-type as well as the catalytically compromised mutant of PLC-γ1 resulted in mitogenesis, suggesting that domains other than the catalytic domain might be important for signaling. By microinjection of different domains of PLC-γ1 into NIH3T3 cells, Smith et al. (25Smith M.R. Liu Y.-l. Kim S.R. Bae Y.S. Kim C.G. Kwon K.-S. Rhee S.G. Kung H.-f. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) showed that either the SH3 domain or the SH2 domains induced a partial response that was restored when they were co-injected. The PH domain, however, did not induce DNA synthesis. In contrast, using the same cells, Huanget al. (26Huang P.S. Davis L. Huber H. Goodhart P.J. Wegrzyn R.E. Oliff A. Heimbrook D.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) showed that deletion of the SH3 domain resulted in complete loss of mitogenic response. Using MDCK epithelial cells and NIH3T3 cells, Wang et al. (27Wang Z. Glück S. Zhang L. Moran M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 590-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) could block PDGF-induced S-phase entry by microinjection of a polypeptide comprising the two SH2 domains and the SH3 domain of PLC-γ1. Microinjection of DAG and IP3 did not stimulate DNA synthesis by themselves but did suppress the inhibitory effect of the SH2-SH2-SH3 polypeptide. These observations suggest that both the SH2 and SH3 domains and the catalytic activity of PLC-γ1 are important for mediation of a mitogenic response. In this report we did not observe any effect on PDGF-BB-induced DNA replication upon overexpression of either wild-type PLC-γ1 or a catalytically compromised version of the lipase. In summary, we have shown that either PI3-kinase or PLC-γ1 are required for induction of chemotaxis by the PDGF β-receptor. Our findings suggest that it is the expression levels of these individual enzymes and the extent of their activation that determines which pathway that mediates the chemotactic response in individual cell lines. It is possible that the PLC-γ1 and the PI3-kinase pathways are both needed for the chemotactic response, or one can substitute for the other given that it is expressed and activated at sufficient levels. Cross-talk between the PLC-γ1 pathway and PI3-kinase pathway is known on several levels. Full activation of PLC-γ1 was shown to require the activity of PI3-kinase (22Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto V.P.

Furthermore, Derman et al. could show that products of PI3-kinase increased cell motility through PKC (29Derman M.P. Toker A. Hartwig J.H. Spokes K. Falck J.R. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. Cantley L.G. J.

In addition to being activated by DAG, a product of PLC-γ1, PKC isoforms have been shown to be phosphorylated and activated by PDK1, a downstream target of PI3-kinase (30Good J.A.L. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the same conserved threonine residue in the activation loop has previously been shown to be essential to render PKC catalytically competent to autophosphorylate (31Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PKC-ε has been shown to be activated by both PI3-kinase and PLC-γ1-dependent pathways (32Moriya S. Kazlauskas A. Akimoto K. Hirai S.-i. Mizuno K. Takenawa T. Fukui Y. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Ohno S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, one cannot exclude the possibility that IP3 produced by PLC-γ1, leading to release of calcium from internal stores, plays a role in the increased chemotactic response seen upon PLC-γ1 overexpression. An important future goal will be to identify the common downstream signaling molecules that mediate the chemotactic response seen after activation of PI3-kinase or PLC-γ1.

https://openalex.org/W2095073086,"The heat shock response inEscherichia coli depends on a transient increase in the intracellular level of ς32 that results from both increased synthesis and transient stabilization of normally unstable ς32. Although the membrane-bound ATP-dependent protease FtsH (HflB) plays an important role in degradation of ς32, our previous results suggested that several cytosolic ATP-dependent proteases including HslVU (ClpQY) are also involved in ς32 degradation (Kanemori, M., Nishihara, K., Yanagi, H., and Yura, T. (1997) J. Bacteriol.179, 7219–7225). We now report on the ATP-dependent proteolysis of ς32 by purified HslVU protease and its unusual dependence on high temperature: ς32 was rapidly degraded at 44 °C, but with much slower rates (∼15-fold) at 35 °C. FtsH-dependent degradation of ς32 also gave similar results. In agreement with these results in vitro, the turnover of ς32 in normally growing cells at high temperature (42 °C) was much faster than at low temperature (30 °C). Taken together with other evidence, these results suggest that the ς32 level during normal growth is primarily determined by the stability (susceptibility to proteases) and synthesis rate of ς32 set by ambient temperature, whereas fine adjustment such as transient stabilization of ς32 observed upon heat shock is brought about through monitoring changes in the cellular state of protein folding. The heat shock response inEscherichia coli depends on a transient increase in the intracellular level of ς32 that results from both increased synthesis and transient stabilization of normally unstable ς32.

When cells and organisms are exposed to high temperature, synthesis of a set of heat shock proteins is rapidly induced. The induction generally occurs at the transcriptional level mediated by specific transcription factors. In Escherichia coli, the level of the heat shock transcription factor ς32 (encoded by the rpoH gene) rapidly and transiently increases upon temperature upshift and directs RNA polymerase to transcribe the heat shock genes encoding molecular chaperones (GroEL, DnaK, etc.), ATP-dependent proteases (Lon (La), ClpXP, HslVU (ClpQY), and FtsH (HflB)), and other heat shock proteins (1Yura T.

The increase in the ς32 level depends on both increased synthesis and stabilization of normally unstable ς32 (half-life of ∼1 min) (5Straus D.B. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Nature. 1987; 329: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Production of abnormal proteins such as those containing amino acid analogs or heterologous proteins can also induce heat shock proteins and mimic the heat shock response (6Goff S.A. Goldgerg A.L. Cell. 1985; 41: 587-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 7Ito K. Akiyama Y. Yura T. Shiba K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 201-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Parsell D.A. Sauer R.T. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1226-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, in the latter cases, the ς32 level increases as the result of stabilization and not of increased synthesis of ς32 (9Wild J. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Altman E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3992-3997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,10Kanemori M. Mori H. Yura T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5648-5653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, stabilization and enhanced synthesis of ς32observed upon temperature upshift represent two distinct events that presumably involve different signaling pathways (3Gross C.A. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology.

Upon temperature upshift from 30 to 42 °C, the rate of ς32 synthesis increases ∼10-fold within 3–4 min (5Straus D.B. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Nature. 1987; 329: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The induction occurs at the translational level mediated by the secondary structure of the 5′-portion of rpoH mRNA (11Nagai H. Yuzawa H. Yura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10515-10519Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 12Yuzawa H. Nagai H. Mori H. Yura T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5449-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Morita M. Kanemori M. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 401-410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent work showed that high temperature directly disrupts the mRNA secondary structure, perhaps without involvement of cellular factors, leading to enhanced ribosome entry and initiation of translation (14Morita T.M. Tanaka Y. Kodama T.S. Kyogoku Y. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Besides translational induction, marked stabilization of ς32 (8-fold) occurs for the first 4–5 min upon heat shock, followed by rapid destabilization (5Straus D.B. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Nature. 1987; 329: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The DnaK chaperone team (DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE) is required for the rapid ς32degradation because ς32 is markedly stabilized indnaK/dnaJ/grpE mutants (15Tilly K. Spence J. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 16Straus D. Walter W. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2202-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Although the exact roles of these chaperones in ς32turnover remain unknown, transient stabilization of ς32has been thought to occur by titrating the chaperones away from ς32 by unfolded proteins accumulating at high temperature since these chaperones are also involved in dealing with unfolded or misfolded proteins (17Keller J.A. Simon L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Straus D.B. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1851-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Accordingly, free DnaK and/or DnaJ chaperones that can engage in the turnover of ς32 have been proposed to act as a “cellular thermometer” that should monitor changes in the folding state of the cell (19Craig E.A. Gross C.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 20Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In agreement with these proposals, DnaK/DnaJ chaperones were shown to be normally limiting in vivo: a slight increase or decrease in the chaperones causes a decrease or increase in ς32 (and consequently, heat shock proteins), respectively (21Tomoyasu T. Ogura T. Tatsuta T. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 567-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A membrane-bound ATP-dependent metalloprotease (FtsH) was the first protease shown to degrade ς32 in vivo and in vitro (22Herman C. Thevenet D. D'Ari R. Bouloc P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 23Tomoyasu T. Gamer J. Bukau B. Kanemori M. Mori H. Rutman A.J. Oppenheim A.B. Yura T. Yamanaka K. Niki H. Hiraga S. Ogura T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2551-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). More recent data suggested that a cytosolic ATP-dependent protease (HslVU) along with other proteases (ClpAP (Ti) and Lon) can also participate in the turnover of ς32 in vivo (24Kanemori M. Nishihara K. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7219-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). HslVU is a two-component ATP-dependent protease consisting of a catalytic subunit (homododecamer of HslV (ClpQ) and an ATPase subunit (homohexa- or heptamer of HslU (ClpY)); one HslV complex is flanked by HslU complexes to form structures resembling the ClpAP protease and the eukaryotic 26 S proteasome (25Kessel M. Wu W.-F. Gottesman S. Kocsis E. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 26Rohrwild M. Pfeifer G. Santarius U. Muller S.A. Huang H.-C. Engel A. Baumeister W. Goldberg A.L. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In this report, we examined degradation of ς32 in vitro by the HslVU protease and found that purified HslVU can degrade ς32 in an ATP-dependent manner. Furthermore, the susceptibility of ς32 to HslVU- or FtsH-mediated proteolysis in vitro markedly increased at high temperature. The marked instability of ς32 at high temperature was also demonstrated in vivo, suggesting that the susceptibility of ς32 to proteases reflecting ambient temperature plays a critical role in the regulation of ς32 and the heat shock response in E. coli. MG1655 (prototrophicE. coli K12) was used for purification of ς32and for most experiments in vivo, and KY2691 (MG1655 ΔhslVU Δ(clpPX-lon) ftsZ2691) (27Kanemori M. Yanagi H. Yura T. J.

A promoterless intact rpoH gene (EcoRV-NsiI fragment) was placed under control of the trc promoter on pTrc99A to obtain pKV1278. pMAL-c-sulA carrying a malE-sulA fusion gene was kindly donated by Y. Ishii and Y. Kato (Kyushu Institute of Technology). L broth (29Tobe T. Ito K. Yura T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was used for generally growing cells; ampicillin (50 μg/ml) was added when necessary. The synthetic medium used was medium E (29Tobe T. Ito K. Yura T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.5% glucose and 2 μg/ml thiamine; ampicillin was used at 10 μg/ml. IPTG (final concentration, 1 mm) was used to induce synthesis of HslV, HslU, ς32, and MBP-SulA directed by the trc or tac promoter. α-Casein (bovine, 70% purity) was purchased from Sigma.l-[35S]Methionine (29.6 TBq/mmol) was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. Other chemicals were obtained from Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, or Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Antiserum against FtsH was kindly supplied by Y. Akiyama (Kyoto University). All protein purification was carried out at 4 °C. HslV or HslU was purified from KY2691 cells harboring pKV1025 or pKV1022, respectively, as described (27Kanemori M. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3674-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified FtsH was generously supplied by T. Ogura (Kumamoto University). ς32 was purified from MG1655 cells harboring pKV1278 basically as described previously (30Liberek K. Galitski T.P. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After 40 min, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 230 mm NaCl, 10% (w/v) sucrose, and 0.1% lysozyme) (30Liberek K.

RNA polymerase core enzyme consisting of β, β′, and two α-subunits was purified from strain KY1603 lacking ς32. Cells were grown to late-log phase in L broth at 37 °C, harvested by centrifugation, suspended in buffer A, and kept on ice for 30 min. After addition of sodium deoxycholate to 0.05%, cells were sonicated and centrifuged at 75,000 × g for 90 min, and proteins were precipitated by ammonium sulfate (0.35 g/ml). The pellet was resuspended and dialyzed against buffer B and loaded onto a HiLoad Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl, and the fractions containing RNA polymerase were precipitated by ammonium sulfate (0.35 g/ml).

The fractions containing RNA polymerase were dialyzed against buffer E and run through a HiPrep Sephacryl S-300 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and RNA polymerase core enzyme was concentrated and stored at −70 °C. MBP-SulA fusion protein was purified from KY2691 cells harboring pMAL-c-sulA. Cells were grown to mid-log phase in L broth containing ampicillin at 37 °C, and production of MBP-SulA was induced by IPTG. After 1 h of incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer E, and sonicated. MBP-SulA fusion protein was purified according to the instruction manual (New England Biolabs Inc.), except that buffer E was used as the column buffer. All purified proteins were >90% pure as estimated by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and their concentration was determined by Bradford protein assays (Bio-Rad) (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (50–120 μl) (33Maurizi M.R. Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Kim S.-H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) for the HslVU protease contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% Triton X-100, 25 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 16 μg/ml HslV, 40 μg/ml HslU, and 40 μg/ml substrates unless otherwise indicated. RNA polymerase (core enzyme) was added at a concentration of 480 μg/ml (1:1 RNA polymerase/ς32molar ratio). The reaction mixture (25 μl) for the FtsH protease (23Tomoyasu T. Gamer J. Bukau B. Kanemori M. Mori H. Rutman A.J. Oppenheim A.B. Yura T. Yamanaka K. Niki H. Hiraga S. Ogura T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2551-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) contained 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 5 mmmagnesium acetate, 12.5 μm zinc acetate, 80 mm NaCl, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 4 mm ATP, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 40 μg/ml FtsH. The mixture was incubated at various temperatures, and the reaction was terminated by mixing with an equal volume of 2× sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Quantification of protein bands was done with a BioImage Intelligent Quantifier. Nucleic acid manipulation (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), SDS-PAGE (29Tobe T. Ito K. Yura T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and immunoblotting (24Kanemori M. Nishihara K. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7219-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) were performed as described previously. Our previous data in vivo suggested that besides FtsH, the cytosolic ATP-dependent proteases including HslVU participate in the turnover of ς32 (24Kanemori M. Nishihara K. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7219-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To test whether HslVU can directly degrade ς32, we purified HslV and HslU separately from a pair of multiprotease-deficient KY2691 mutants lacking all known cytosolic ATP-dependent proteases, but harboring an expression plasmid for hslV or hslU. This permitted us to obtain HslV and HslU preparations with no contamination of other cytosolic ATP-dependent proteases. Although these strains carried the wild-type ftsH gene, no detectable amount of FtsH was found in either the HslV or HslU preparation used as judged by immunoblotting (data not shown). When purified ς32 was incubated with HslV, HslU, and ATP under the standard assay conditions at 42 °C, marked degradation of ς32 occurred, whereas no detectable degradation occurred when any of these components was omitted (Fig. 1A). These results support our previous observations in vivo, suggesting that HslVU and other cytoplasmic proteases directly contribute to the turnover of ς32 to appreciable extents. To determine the stoichiometry of HslV (19 kDa) and HslU (50 kDa) for the maximal proteolytic activity, the reaction was carried out by increasing the amount of HslV with a fixed amount of HslU (40 μg/ml, 0.8 μm protomer) or by increasing the amount of HslU with a fixed amount of HslV (16 μg/ml, 0.84 μm protomer). In both cases, the amount of ς32 hydrolyzed increased with increasing amounts of the other component and reached the maximal activity when HslV and HslU were present at an approximate molar ratio of 1:1 protomers (Fig. 1,B and C). These results are consistent with the notion that the HslVU protease consists of one HslV dodecamer and two HslU hexa- or heptamers (25Kessel M. Wu W.-F. Gottesman S. Kocsis E. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 26Rohrwild M. Pfeifer G. Santarius U. Muller S.A. Huang H.-C. Engel A. Baumeister W. Goldberg A.L. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of RNA polymerase on ς32 degradation by the HslVU protease, ς32was preincubated with RNA polymerase at 44 °C before adding HslVU. ς32 was hardly degraded by HslVU under these conditions (Fig. 2, lane 5), whereas active degradation occurred in the control without RNA polymerase (lane 2), indicating that the prior interaction with RNA polymerase protected ς32 from proteolytic attack by HslVU. By contrast, RNA polymerase did not affect degradation of the cell division inhibitor SulA, another substrate for HslVU (27Kanemori M. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3674-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wu W.-F. Zhou Y.-N. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3681-3687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), fused to the maltose-binding protein (MBP-SulA) (lanes 8 and 11). When RNA polymerase was incubated with MBP-SulA fusion protein at 44 °C, about half of the RNA polymerase became insoluble and disappeared from the soluble fraction (lane 12). When preincubated with ς32, however, most of the RNA polymerase remained soluble (lane 6), indicating that most of the ς32 binds to the polymerase to form RNA polymerase holoenzyme. When proteolysis of ς32 by HslVU was examined at four different temperatures (35, 38, 41, and 44 °C), a striking temperature dependence was observed (Fig. 3 and Table I). Only limited degradation occurred at lower temperatures (35 and 38 °C), whereas rapid degradation was observed at higher temperatures (41 and 44 °C). The ratio of activities at 44 and 35 °C based on the initial rates of proteolysis was estimated to be ∼15 (Table I). These results indicate that ς32 can be degraded by HslVU at the physiological temperature range, but particularly efficiently at higher temperatures.Table IHigh temperature-dependent proteolysis of ς 32SubstrateProteolytic activity35 °C38 °C41 °C44 °Cmg/h/mgς320.36 ± 0.050.67 ± 0.043.3 ± 0.35.5 ± 0.3(1)(1.9)(9.2)(15)MBP-SulA4.4 ± 0.16.2 ± 0.19.0 ± 0.810.4 ± 0.5(1)(1.4)(2.0)(2.4)α-Casein3.1 ± 0.24.9 ± 0.47.3 ± 0.58.9 ± 0.5(1)(1.6)(2.4)(2.9)Proteolytic activities of HslVU (milligrams of substrate hydrolyzed per h/mg of HslV under the standard conditions) were determined on the basis of initial reaction rates in experiments similar to those presented in Figs. 3 and 4.

Open table in a new tab Proteolytic activities of HslVU (milligrams of substrate hydrolyzed per h/mg of HslV under the standard conditions) were determined on the basis of initial reaction rates in experiments similar to those presented in Figs. 3 and 4. Averages of two to four experiments are shown. Values in parentheses indicate activities relative to those at 35 °C with each substrate. To address the question of whether ς32 or HslVU is primarily responsible for the observed high temperature-dependent ς32 degradation, two other substrates (MBP-SulA and α-casein) were tested and compared with ς32 for the temperature dependence of proteolysis. When MBP-SulA fusion protein was incubated with HslVU and ATP at various temperatures, only a weak temperature dependence was observed, unlike with ς32: the fusion protein was degraded at 35 °C with appreciable efficiency, ∼40% of that at 44 °C (Fig. 4A and Table I). Similar results were obtained when α-casein was digested with HslVU (Fig. 4B and Table I). Taken together, these results suggest that ς32 rather than HslVU is primarily responsible for the observed dependence of proteolytic activities on high temperature. To further confirm the unusual temperature dependence of ς32 degradation, we carried out similar experiments with FtsH, known to degrade ς32 in vivo and in vitro. Accordingly, ς32 was incubated with FtsH at 35 or 44 °C in the presence of ATP under the conditions used by Tomoyasu et al.(23Tomoyasu T. Gamer J. Bukau B. Kanemori M. Mori H. Rutman A.J. Oppenheim A.B. Yura T. Yamanaka K. Niki H. Hiraga S. Ogura T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2551-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, ς32 degradation was much faster (∼4-fold) at 44 °C than at 35 °C. By contrast, α-casein used as a control substrate was degraded with similar efficiencies at both temperatures (Fig. 5B), indicating that ς32 is also susceptible to FtsH-mediated proteolysis particularly at high temperature. These results strongly suggest that the unusual high temperature dependence of ς32 degradation is ascribed to certain structural features of ς32, although the possibility that both HslVU and FtsH proteases exhibit an increased affinity for ς32at the elevated temperature was not excluded. We then compared the susceptibility of ς32 to chymotrypsin, known to exhibit a low substrate specificity. When ς32 was incubated with chymotrypsin at 35 or 44 °C, it was promptly degraded at both temperatures, and several major degradation products appeared that were tentatively referred to as peptides 1–5 (Fig. 6). Peptides 1 and 5 rapidly appeared and gradually disappeared with similar time courses at both temperatures, indicating that chymotrypsin exerted quantitatively similar activities at both temperatures. On the other hand, peptide 2 gradually accumulated and remained for some time at 35 °C, but accumulated much less at 44 °C. In contrast, peptides 3 and 4 appeared more rapidly at 44 °C than at 35 °C. These results suggest that peptide 1 represents a primary intermediate in the degradation pathways at both temperatures and that further degradation (to yield peptides 2–4) follows disparate kinetics (or cleavage patterns) at 35 and 44 °C. The conformation of ς32 might differ significantly at the two temperatures. We next examined the reversibility of the change in sensitivity of ς32 to HslVU proteolysis by comparing the results from four distinct incubation protocols (Fig. 7). The first two protocols (I and II) served as controls, in which both the initial 2-h preincubation of ς32 alone and the subsequent incubation with HslVU (1 h) were done at 44 and 35 °C, respectively. In the third and fourth protocols, ς32 was kept at 44 °C for the first hour, shifted to 35 °C for another hour, and finally incubated with the HslVU protease (1 h) at 44 °C (protocol III) or at 35 °C (protocol IV). The results showed that >70% of ς32 was degraded at 44 °C (protocol III), whereas only ∼10% was degraded at 35 °C (protocol IV), clearly indicating the reversibility of the temperature-dependent change in susceptibility to the protease. In other words, ς32probably assumes a state more sensitive or refractory to the attack by the HslVU protease depending on the temperature (44 or 35 °C) to which it was last exposed. In view of the above results obtained in vitro with two proteases that can degrade ς32, we addressed the question of whether thein vivo turnover of ς32 reflects the observed high susceptibility of ς32 to proteases at high temperature. Thus, the half-life of ς32 was determined with exponentially growing cells at different temperatures by pulse-chase experiments, followed by immunoprecipitation with specific antiserum. When wild-type cells (MG1655) grown at 30, 37, and 42 °C were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and chased with excess unlabeled methionine, the half-life of ς32 showed a clear dependence on temperature: 1 min at 30 °C, 20 s at 37 °C, and 10–15 s at 42 °C (Fig. 8A), indicating that ς32 is extremely unstable at high temperature. To further analyze the temperature dependence of ς32degradation in vivo, we also examined the stability of ς32 by using the ς32 overexpression system. IPTG was added to the exponentially growing cells at 30 °C to induce ς32 synthesis directed by the trc promoter on the expression plasmid (pKV1278). After 30 min, chloramphenicol was added to stop further protein synthesis, and the culture was divided into two, one kept at 30 °C and the other shifted to 42 °C. The half-life of ς32 was determined by following the remaining levels of ς32 by immunoblotting at both temperatures (Fig. 8B). The half-life of ς32turned out to be ∼20 min at 30 °C under these conditions. When shifted to 42 °C, ς32 was stable for 3–4 min, followed by rapid degradation with a half-life of 1 min or less. The latter observation also suggests that the destabilization of ς32 at high temperature does not require de novo protein synthesis. These results seem to be quite consistent with those obtained in vitro. The initial time lag consistent with the temporary stabilization previously observed by Straus et al. (5Straus D.B. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Nature. 1987; 329: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) is probably explained by assuming that nonnative proteins accumulated upon temperature upshift transiently titrate chaperones and proteases away from ς32. The present experiments demonstrated that purified HslVU protease can catalyze the ATP-dependent proteolysis of ς32, as predicted by our previous genetic data (24Kanemori M. Nishihara K. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7219-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). As was the case with FtsH (23Tomoyasu T. Gamer J. Bukau B. Kanemori M. Mori H. Rutman A.J. Oppenheim A.B. Yura T. Yamanaka K. Niki H. Hiraga S. Ogura T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2551-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and ClpAP (36Wawrzynow A. Wojtkowiak D. Marszalek J. Banecki B. Jonsen M. Graves B. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) proteases, the HslVU protease did not require the presence of DnaK/DnaJ chaperones for activity, although these chaperones are needed for the rapid turnover of ς32 in vivo (15Tilly K. Spence J. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 16Straus D. Walter W. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2202-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Since the Lon protease can also degrade ς32 in vitro, 2H.-C. Huang and A. L. Goldberg, personal communication. most of the known ATP-dependent proteases (possibly except for ClpXP) appear to be capable of hydrolyzing ς32 as their common substrate. Such an overlapping specificity is not unique to ς32 because several other proteins are now known to be degraded by more than one proteases: this includes Xis of phage λ (37Leffers Jr., G.G. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the SsrA-tagged λ repressor (38Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y.-N. Sauer R.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1338-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 39Herman C. Thevenet D. Bouloc P. Walker G.C. D'Ari R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1348-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and the SulA cell division inhibitor (27Kanemori M. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3674-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wu W.-F. Zhou Y.-N. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3681-3687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Special interest is attached to the case of ς32, however, because the above proteases and their subunits (except ClpA) are heat shock proteins under ς32 control (3Gross C.A. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1382-1399Google Scholar). This means that these proteases can autogenously regulate their own intracellular levels by modulating the turnover of ς32 as their substrate. Furthermore, since Lon, ClpAP, and HslVU proteases are known to recognize and degrade nonnative proteins in vivo (40Gottesman S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 465-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), they are expected to play roles similar to those of the DnaK/DnaJ chaperones in modulating the heat shock response, i.e. the free proteases may also serve as a cellular thermometer. In addition, the membrane-associated FtsH protease was quite active in degrading α-casein (Fig. 5), a widely used substrate for cytosolic ATP-dependent proteases. FtsH may also turn out to be involved in degradation of various nonnative proteins in vivo and consequently in modulation of the heat shock response. The previous results suggested a nearly equal contribution of the membrane-bound protease FtsH and the sum of three cytosolic proteases (HslVU, ClpAP, and Lon) in the turnover of ς32 in vivo (24Kanemori M. Nishihara K. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7219-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), although it was difficult to assess the relative contribution of individual proteases accurately in normal E. coli cells. The proteolysis of ς32 by HslVU or FtsH showed a marked dependence on high temperature as compared with that of other substrates (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). The results of chymotrypsin digestion of ς32 suggested a conformational change of ς32 as a basis for the observed differences in susceptibility to the proteases between 35 and 44 °C. Although the exact nature of the change(s) remains obscure, it seems likely that a conformational change occurs at a restricted region of ς32 since ς32 evidently retains much of the activities at 44 °C in vivo (41Herendeen S.L. VanBogelen R.A. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 185-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in vitro(Fig. 2) (42Blaszczak A. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. Liberek K. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 5085-5093Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). ς32 may exhibit a unique intrinsic instability based on a conformational change at high temperature. Alternatively, the proteases might show increased affinities for ς32 at high temperature, although these possibilities are not mutually exclusive. In agreement with the results obtained in vitro, the half-life of ς32 in vivo as determined by pulse-chase experiments with normally growing cells turned out to be much shorter at higher temperature than at lower temperature, ∼1 min at 30 °C and 10–15 s at 42 °C (Fig. 8A). Tillyet al. (15Tilly K. Spence J. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) reported previously, using an overexpression system of ς32, that the half-life of ς32varied with temperature: 0.7 min at 42 °C, 1.3 min at 37 °C, 1.7 min at 30 °C, and 15 min at 22 °C, quite consistent with our results. As shown in Fig. 8B, the overproduced ς32 that was markedly stabilized at 30 °C was rapidly degraded upon a shift to 42 °C in the absence of protein synthesis, indicating that destabilization of ς32 at high temperature does not require de novo synthesis of degradation machinery including proteases and chaperones. As to the requirement of the DnaK chaperone team for the turnover of ς32 in vivo, it should be noted that the dependence of ς32 degradation on these chaperones (particularly DnaJ and GrpE) was much less striking at high temperature (42 °C) than at low temperature (30 °C) (16Straus D. Walter W. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2202-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). These results could be related to the high susceptibility of ς32 to proteases at high temperature. The DnaK/DnaJ chaperones might make ς32 more susceptible to proteases. However, the presence of any of the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperones failed to affect the FtsH-mediated ς32 proteolysis under the conditions used by Liberek and co-workers (43Blaszczak A. Georgopoulos C. Liberek K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In any event, the present results combined with other evidence suggest that the intracellular stability of ς32 is modulated by its own susceptibility to proteases reflecting ambient temperature, as well as through interaction with the chaperones. Finally, the present data raise the intriguing question of the potential physiological significance of the unusually high instability of ς32 at high temperature. Even when the difference in cellular growth rate at 30 and 42 °C (∼2-fold) was taken into consideration, the in vivo turnover of ς32seemed to be appreciably faster at 42 °C. On the other hand, the synthesis rate of ς32 at 42 °C appears to be severalfold higher than that at 30 °C (5Straus D.B. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Nature. 1987; 329: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). 3M. T. Morita and T. Yura, unpublished observation. The finding that cells synthesizing ς32 at a higher rate simultaneously exhibit increased degradation of ς32 at high temperature might seem paradoxical. However, the increased synthesis primarily determined by the stability of rpoH mRNA secondary structure (14Morita T.M. Tanaka Y. Kodama T.S. Kyogoku Y. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) would be absolutely needed to rapidly respond to temperature upshift, whereas the higher rate of degradation may be required to counteract the higher rate of synthesis to avoid excessive accumulation of ς32. Although higher levels of ς32 are required for cell growth at higher temperature (44Yamamori T. Yura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 860-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), excessive ς32 is deleterious and inhibits cell growth (15Tilly K. Spence J. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 45Bahl H. Echols H. Straus D.B. Court D. Crowl R. Georgopoulos C.P. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We suggest that the basal level of ς32 is determined by its synthesis rate and intrinsic stability, both directly reflecting the ambient temperature. In addition, the temporary adjustment or fine-tuning of the ς32 level such as the transient stabilization of ς32 observed immediately following heat shock is accomplished most effectively by modulating its stability in accordance with the state of protein folding in the cell.

The bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan assembly machinery comprises, among other components, multimodular (transglycosylase/transpeptidase) membrane enzymes that catalyze the polymerization of lipid-transported disaccharide-pentapeptide units. Cross-linking of peptidyl moieties of adjacent glycan strands is a two-step reaction. The first step involves the rupture of thed-alanyl-d-alanine bond of a peptide unit precursor acting as carbonyl donor, the release of the carboxyl-terminal d-alanine, and the formation of a serine ester-linked peptidyl enzyme. The second step involves the breakdown of the peptidyl enzyme and the formation of a new peptide bond between the carbonyl of the d-alanyl moiety and the ω-amino group of another peptide unit acting as amino acceptor. The enzyme is classified as a dd-transpeptidase because the susceptible peptide bond of the carbonyl donor extends between two carbon atoms with thed-configuration. Penicillins, the most familiar antibacterial agents, exert their effects by inactivating the serine dd-transpeptidase modules of the peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes. Because penicillin is a cyclic analogue of thed-alanyl-d-alanine-terminated carbonyl donors, the reaction stops at the level of the serine ester-linked penicilloyl enzyme, and the enzymes behave as penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). 1The abbreviations used are: PBPs, penicillin-binding proteins; MIRAS, multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering; MHP, molecular hydrophobicity potential; Wat, water1The abbreviations used are: PBPs, penicillin-binding proteins; MIRAS, multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering; MHP, molecular hydrophobicity potential; Wat, water Resistance to β-lactam antibiotics is PBP- and β-lactamase-mediated. PBPs with a reduced affinity for the drug result from local changes in the amino acid sequences of the wild-type forms. Serine β-lactamases hydrolyze penicillin into penicilloate via the formation of a hydrolytically labile serine ester-linked penicilloyl enzyme. The emergence of an increasing number of resistant bacteria has become a threatening public health problem. It has fostered interest in understanding the biochemical and mechanistic features of the penicillin targets. The Streptomyces K15 serinedd-transpeptidase/PBP (hereafter referred to as the K15 enzyme) is a 262-amino acid monomodular protein with a molecular mass of 27,474 Da (1Nguyen-Distèche M. Leyh-Bouille M. Ghuysen J.-M. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although lacking transmembrane segments, the K15 enzyme is associated with the plasma membrane of the wild-type strain. Overexpression of the encoding gene in Streptomyces lividansresults in the secretion of ∼30% of the synthesized enzyme in the culture medium. The cloned enzyme has the same enzymatic properties as the membrane-associated form and requires the presence of 0.5m NaCl to remain water-soluble (2Palomeque-Messia P. Quittre V. Leyh-Bouille M. Nguyen-Distèche M. Gershater C.J.L. Dacey I.K. Dusart J. Van Beeumen J. Ghuysen J.-M. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The fate and rate of the two-step transpeptidation reaction catalyzed by the K15 enzyme depend on both the nature of the scissile bond (peptide, ester, thiol ester) of the carbonyl donor and the acceptor activity of an exogenous nucleophile (3Grandchamps J. Nguyen-Distèche M. Damblon C. Frère J.-M. Ghuysen J.-M. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). With (R)-d-alanyl-d-alanine-terminated peptide donors and in aqueous media, the released d-alanine is reutilized as an amino acceptor in the enzyme deacylation step so that the peptide donor is continuously regenerated and the enzyme is seemingly silent, although it turns over one time every 10 s. In the presence of amino acceptors structurally related to cell wall peptidoglycan, the peptidyl ((R)-d-alanyl) enzyme intermediate is aminolyzed much more effectively than it is hydrolyzed, and under certain conditions, the acyltransferase functions exclusively as a dd-transpeptidase (4Nguyen-Distèche M. Leyh-Bouille M. Pirlot S. Frère J.-M. Ghuysen J.-M. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, thedd-carboxypeptidases/PBPs have a much increased preference for water as the attacking nucleophile of the peptidyl enzyme. The K15 enzyme is a PBP. The value of the second-order rate constant of enzyme acylation by benzylpenicillin is ∼150m−1 s−1, and the serine ester-linked penicilloyl enzyme undergoes hydrolytic breakdown at an extremely slow rate via two pathways that give rise to benzylpenicilloate and phenylacetylglycine, respectively. Cefoxitin is a better inactivating agent (rate constant of ∼850m−1 s−1), and in this respect, the K15 enzyme differs from many PBPs for which benzylpenicillin is one of the most efficient known inactivators tested (5Leyh-Bouille M. Nguyen-Distèche M. Pirlot S. Veithen A. Bourguignon C. Ghuysen J.-M. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Low enzyme acylation rate values confer increased “intrinsic” resistance on the bacterial cell. Thus, for example, the values of the rate constants of enzyme acylation by benzylpenicillin are 10–20m−1 s−1 for the low affinity PBP2′ of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and PBP5 of Enterococcus hirae. In contrast, the rate constant values are 18,000 m−1 s−1 for theStreptomyces R61 dd-carboxypeptidase/PBP, 58,000m−1 s−1 for Streptococcus pneumoniae PBP2x, and 300,000 m−1s−1 for Bacillus licheniformis PBP1 (6Hackbarth C.J.

Among the PBPs, only the structure of the monomodulardd-carboxypeptidase of Streptomyces R61 has been determined at high resolution (19Kelly J.A. Kuzin A.P. J. Mol.

Understanding the structure-function relationships among members of the penicilloyl-serine transferases requires a detailed knowledge of each type of enzyme of this family at the atomic level. The K15 enzyme is the only serine dd-transpeptidase/PBP that has been characterized in detail in biochemical terms. In this paper, we describe the high resolution x-ray crystallographic structure of this enzyme, compare its structure with that of the class A serine β-lactamases, and emphasize the most significant structural features that distinguish these two types of enzymes. The K15 enzyme is synthesized in the form of a 291-amino acid precursor possessing a cleavable 29-amino acid signal peptide. The overproduced soluble enzyme was purified to 95% homogeneity, and the mass spectrum revealed a mass corresponding to the theoretical value of 27,474 Da. Large bipyramidal crystals with maximum dimensions of 0.6 × 0.5 × 0.3 mm were obtained at 20 °C within a few days in 10-μl drops containing 1.3 mg/ml protein solution in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 0.4m NaCl, 10 mm NaN3, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 7.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 or 8000, equilibrated against a 1-ml reservoir well containing 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 or 8000 in the same buffer. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121, with cell dimensions ofa = 46.59 Å, b = 54.53 Å, and c = 108.70 Å. They contain 51% solvent and one molecule/asymmetric unit (21Englebert S. Charlier P. Fonzé E. Tóth Y. Vermeire M. Van Beeumen J. Grandchamps J. Hoffmann K. Leyh-Bouille M. Nguyen-Distèche M.

The x-ray source was graphite-monochromated Cuα radiation produced by a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode generator operating at 50 kV and 90 mA with a 0.3-mm fine-focus cathode. Indexing, integration, scaling, and merging of the intensity data were carried out using the XENGEN Version 2.0 (Native 1 and 2 and heavy atom derivatives) (22Howard A.J. J.

Open table in a new tab The structure was solved by the method of multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (MIRAS) using the PHASES program (24Furey W. PHASES Manual. University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA1992Google Scholar). Of the 30 heavy atom derivatives tested, only p-chloromercuribenzoate and mersalyl mercury derivatives showed binding sites. Of the two cysteine residues present in the K15 enzyme at positions 38 and 223, respectively, only one is labeled by p-chloromercuribenzoate in aqueous solution, resulting in a drastic decrease in the peptidase activity and penicillin-binding capacity (25Leyh-Bouille Nguyen-Distèche M. Bellefroid-Bourguignon C. Ghuysen J.-M. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 893-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Table I gives the refinement parameters of the heavy atom derivatives at 3.0-Å resolution. The quality of the 3.0-Å MIRAS electron density map was improved by solvent flattening using the SQUASH program (26Zhang K.Y.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1993; 49: 213-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein structure was built stepwise using TURBO-FRODO (27Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partner Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989: 77-78Google Scholar) and refined by simulated annealing using X-PLOR (28Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, a System for Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.0. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Fourteen cycles of refinement (positions and temperature factors) and model refitting were carried out. At each step, the structure was constructed on the basis of 2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc maps computed at a 20-Å lower resolution limit. As long as the model was incomplete, the MIRAS phases were used and combined with those determined by the model in order to improve the quality of the electron density map and to avoid model bias. The structure was refined to 2.0-Å resolution with a conventional R-factor of 18.6%, and the statistics of refinement are summarized in Table I. The hydrophobicity of a molecule is usually defined by a single parameter representing its partition coefficient between water and octanol. For the analysis of complex interactions between lipids and proteins, this parameter was extended to the most elaborate concept of helical hydrophobic moment (29Eisenberg D. Weiss R.M. Terwilliger T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). The calculation of the MHP along the peptide sequence was based upon the concept introduced by Furetet al. (30Furet P. Sele A. Cohen J. Mol. Graph. 1988; 6: 183-189Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and Fauchère et al. (31Fauchère J.L. Quarendon P. Kaetterer L. J. Mol. Graph. 1988; 6: 203-206Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar) for a small molecule. This approach was extended to a three-dimensional representation of the molecular envelope with isopotential contour lines around an 18-residue helical peptide (32Brasseur R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16120-16127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We assumed that the hydrophobic interaction between two residues decreases exponentially with the distance between the residues according to the following equation: MHP = Σ Etriexp(ri − di), whereEtri is the transfer energy of the atomi, ri is the radius of the atomi, and di is the distance between atomi and a point M. The transfer energy Etri represents the energy for individual atoms, calculated from the transfer energy compiled by Tanford (33Tanford C. The Hydrophobic Effect: Formation of Micelles and Biological Membranes. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1973Google Scholar). Assuming that the experimental molecular energy is the sum of the atomic energies, theEtri values are estimated for the different atoms. The MHP for proteins was calculated by a cross-sectional computation method. A plane was moved every 3 Å, and the MHP was computed for all points in the plane defined by a 3-Å side grid. The overall three-dimensional structure of the K15 enzyme consists of a single polypeptide chain organized into two domains. One domain contains mainly α-helices, and the second one is of α/β-type. The K15 enzyme bears the signature fold topology of the penicilloyl-serine transferase superfamily, but it exhibits more overall similarity to the class A β-lactamases (Fig. 1). Using the standard secondary structure numbering of the class A β-lactamases (35Ambler R.P. Coulson A.F.W. Frère J.-M. Ghuysen J.-M. Joris B. Forsman M. Levesque R.C. Tiraby G. Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), the first domain contains a central helix (α2) that is surrounded by four helices (α4, α5, α6, and α9) and, in addition, a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β2a to β2d) and helix α3. The α/β-domain consists of a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β1 to β5) that is covered on one face by the short helix α10 and the long carboxyl-terminal helix α11 and on the other face by helix α8 and one turn of a 3-10 helix (α0). Optimal superimposition of the K15 enzyme and class A β-lactamases was performed using a maximum distance cutoff of 1.2 Å and, as fitted atoms, the equivalent C-α atoms of the catalytic residues Ser35, Lys38, Ser96, Lys213, and Gly215 for the K15 enzyme and Ser70, Lys73, Ser130, Lys234, and Gly236 for the class A β-lactamases. The structurally superimposable regions comprise 170 amino acids, and the root mean square deviation for the 170 pairs of C-α atoms varies from 2.1 to 2.5 Å depending on the β-lactamase being compared. As shown in Fig. 2, one may note that pairwise comparison between the amino acid sequences reveals only ∼15% of strict identity between the K15 enzyme and each of the class A β-lactamases. In comparison with the class A β-lactamases, the K15 enzyme exhibits four main structural differences (Fig. 3A): (i) the absence of the NH2-terminal helix α1; (ii) the insertion of 11 residues after helix α5, resulting in the extended helix α6; (iii) the absence of helix α7, which contains the class A β-lactamase-specific EXELN motif; and (iv) the occurrence of a large insert between helices α9 and α10. This insert contains strands β2c and β2d of the four-stranded β-sheet, and the stability of this β-sheet on the surface of the α-domain is reinforced by two salt bridges involving Asp54–Arg86 and Asp81–Arg191. The MHP analysis (32Brasseur R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16120-16127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the K15 enzyme and class A β-lactamases (Fig. 4) reveals an increase in the hydrophobic isopotential areas in the K15 enzyme, generated by the N- and C-terminal regions that cover the five-stranded β-sheet and the loop corresponding to the 20-amino acid insert. This marked hydrophobic characteristic, which is very different from the homogeneous distribution of the hydrophilic/hydrophobic isopotential areas observed in soluble exocellular proteins, could lead to the interaction of the K15 enzyme with the plasma membrane. In comparison with the Streptomyces R61 carboxypeptidase/PBP (Protein Data Bank code 3PTE) and the class C β-lactamase of E. cloacae P99 (Protein Data Bank code 1BLS), the K15 enzyme shows a much higher extent of divergence (Fig. 3B). The only common secondary structures are the central helix α2 and the five-stranded β-sheet. Helices α5, α6, α8, and α11 are also present, but they have different lengths and orientations. As observed with the other penicilloyl-serine transferases, the active site of the K15 enzyme is located at the interface between the two domains and is mainly defined by three conserved structural elements (Fig. 5). The center of the catalytic cleft is occupied by the Ser35-Thr36-Thr37-Lys38tetrad, which includes the nucleophilic Ser35 residue at the amino-terminal end of helix α2. One side of the cavity is defined by the Ser96-Gly97-Cys98 loop connecting helices α4 and α5. The Lys213-Thr214-Gly215 triad lies on strand β3 on the opposite side of the cavity. The backbone NH group of the essential Ser35 residue and that of Ser216 downstream from the motif Lys213-Thr214-Gly215 occupy positions that are compatible with the oxyanion hole function required for catalysis. With X denoting a variable amino acid, the amino acid sequence signature of the penicilloyl-serine transferases is defined by the three active-site structural elements: the invariant S*XXK tetrad, the SX(N/C/S) or YXN triad, and the (K/H/R)(T/S)G triad. Divergence at the level of the second element might have given rise to the “tyrosine” and “serine” enzyme subgroups, respectively (37Knox J.R. Moews P.C. Frère J.-M. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 937-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). All known PBPs, including the K15 enzyme and the class A β-lactamases, belong to the so-called serine subgroup, whereas the Streptomyces R61dd-carboxypeptidase/PBP and the class C β-lactamases belong to the tyrosine subgroup. Superimposition of the active sites reveals that the γ-OH of the serine residue of the first subgroup and the phenolic OH of the tyrosine residue of the second subgroup occupy equivalent positions with respect to the nucleophilic serine and strand β3, respectively (Fig. 6A). As the side chain of a tyrosine residue is bulkier than that of a serine residue, this spatial equivalence must be the result of a reorganization of both the corresponding loops and the interconnecting secondary structures of all the α-domains. Accordingly, the serine and tyrosine subgroups show a larger extent of divergence at the level of the α-domains than at the level of the α/β-domains. The top of the catalytic cleft of the K15 enzyme is defined mainly by the Thr199-Asn200-Gly201 triad (immediately upstream from helix α10), and the bottom of the cleft by the backbone of the Phe142-Asp143-Gly144 triad. The Thr199-Asn200-Gly201 triad adopts the same topology as in the class A β-lactamases (Fig. 6B) despite large structural differences between the helix α9/strand β3-connecting polypeptide chains. In the class A β-lactamases, the EXXLN motif of the Ω-loop (which connects helices α6 and α7) lies at the bottom of the active site, and the side chain of Glu166 plays an important role in the catalyzed hydrolysis of penicillin. The K15 enzyme has no motif similar to the Ω-loop, and the fold defined at this position by the Phe142-Asp143-Gly144 triad is structurally equivalent to that defined by the Gln219-Ala220-Tyr221 triad in theE. cloacae class C β-lactamase and by the Ser236-Ala237-Gly238 triad in theStreptomyces R61 dd-carboxypeptidase (Fig. 6A). In the crystal structure, the K15 enzyme is solvated by 149 ordered water molecules mainly located in the first coordination shell, directly hydrogen-bonded to protein atoms. In the active site, where a dense hydrogen bond network prevails, the solvent molecules that interact with the essential amino acids (TableII) are the most buried ones and, accordingly, exhibit the lowest temperature factor values. As the charge distribution induced by the side chains varies among the different classes of enzymes, it is obviously difficult to make a rigorous comparison. The unique water contact with the hydroxyl group of the active Ser35 residue is made with Wat336. This water molecule could be compared with the one found in the oxyanion hole of the class A (Wat295 for the TEM1 enzyme) and class C (Wat1087 for the P99 enzyme) β-lactamases. However, Wat336 is not buried so deeply in the catalytic pocket and does not make any interaction with the backbone amide groups of Ser35 and Thr214. In comparison with the other penicilloyl-serine transferases, the side chain of the nucleophilic serine of the K15 enzyme is displaced through the χ1-dihedral angle rotation. The values of χ1 are 52.3°, −71.5°, −16.3°, and 56.6° in the K15, TEM1, R61, and P99 structures, respectively. The shift of the hydroxyl group of Ser35 toward strand β3 and away from the bottom of the active site can certainly be related to the displacement of Wat336.Table IIHydrogen bonding pattern in the catalytic cleftAmino acid/water identificationDistanceÅSer35(OG)Ser216) (N)3.04Wat336 (0)2.96Lys38(NZ)Se96 (OG)2.98Cys98 (SG)2.76Ser96 (OG)Lys213 (NZ)2.91Thr199 (OG1)Thr214 (OG1)2.77Wat303 (O)2.76Wat318 (O)2.66Lys213 (NZ)Thc214 (O)3.03Wat303 (O)2.87Thr214(OG1)Wat311 (O)2.95Wat303(O)Met93 (O)2.97Wat309 (O)3.21Wat305 (O)Arg248 (NH2)3.02Wat311 (O)2.62Wat309(O)Asn198 (OD1)2.91Wat336(O)Wat311 (O)2.98 Open table in a new tab In the same way, the so-called hydrolytic water molecule found in all class A β-lactamase structures is not really conserved in the K15 enzyme. This water molecule (Wat292 in the TEM1 enzyme) forms a bridge between the nucleophilic serine hydroxyl group and the Glu166 carboxylate side chain. Without the Ω-loop, the K15, R61, and P99 enzymes cannot exhibit such a water molecule that is tightly bound and a fortiori for the K15 enzyme, which has a different conformation for the active serine. One can only remark that as in the R61 and P99 enzymes, there is in the K15 structure a water molecule (Wat381) that neighbors the class A β-lactamase hydrolytic water molecule, but it does not interact with the essential amino acids and has a high temperature factor (40.3 Å2). As found in all penicilloyl-serine transferases possessing a lysine residue in the conserved (Lys/His/Arg)-(Thr/Ser)-Gly triad, a water molecule (Wat303 in the K15 enzyme) is located at the top of the catalytic pocket and plays a structural role in stabilizing the Lys213 side chain. One may note that theStreptomyces R61 dd-carboxypeptidase is the only known enzyme of the family that has a histidine residue instead of a lysine or arginine residue in this triad. The accessible surface area of the K15 enzyme crystal structure has a value of 10,960 Å2 as computed with the DSSP program (36Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (11981) Google Scholar), and its distribution along the polypeptide chain is quite similar to that observed in the class A β-lactamases (38Knox J.R. Moews P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 435-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The central helix α2 and the five-stranded β-sheet are inaccessible to solvent, except strand β2, which is more exposed. Helices α4 and α5 are also buried, and the other α-helices have an amphiphilic profile. Strands β2a and β2d of the small β-sheet are very well exposed, strand β2c is amphiphilic, and strand β2b is more buried. The more accessible regions (Val1–Lys3, Asn50-Leu51, Asn70-Asn71, Ile145–Ala149, and Gly231-Gly232) correspond to the highest temperature factor values (>30 Å2). The analysis also reveals very low accessibility values for several charged residues of the K15 enzyme. Among these, Lys38 and Lys213 are directly involved in the dense hydrogen bond network of the catalytic cleft. Asp99 interacts with the α-domain and probably stabilizes the position of the Ser96-Gly97-Cys98 motif, as does Asp131 in the class A β-lactamases (39Jacob F. Joris B. Lepage S. Dusart J. Frère J.-M. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Asp143 and Asn150, at the bottom of the active pocket, interact with protein core atoms, allowing the positioning of the carbonyl group of Asp143 in the catalytic cleft. Arg248, near strand β3, may play the same role as Arg220 or Arg244 in the class A β-lactamases (40Jacob F. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Dideberg O. Joris B. Frère J.-M. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Two polar residues, Asn198 and Asn200, above the catalytic pocket, are also quite buried. They may be compared with the Asp214 (Asn214) /Asp233 pair in class A β-lactamases and the Glu272/His234 pair in class C β-lactamases. These latter residues are involved in specific interactions, in particular with a water molecule equivalent to Wat303 in the K15 enzyme (16Fonzé E. Charlier P. Tóth Y. Vermeire M. Raquet X. Dubus A. Frère J.-M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1995; 51: 682-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Several scenari may be evoked through which the present day penicilloyl-serine transferases of different groups and classes have evolved from a protein ancestor similar to the K15 enzyme in structure and catalytic properties. One evolution pathway is loss of peptidase activity, loss of membrane association site, and acquired catalyzed hydrolysis of the penicilloyl enzyme. The resulting exocellular β-lactamases hydrolyze penicillin into biologically inactive metabolites, providing the bacteria with a defensive mechanism of remarkable efficacy. On good β-lactam substrates, the TEM β-lactamase may turn over 1000 times/s or more. In this respect and in comparison with the K15 enzyme, the TEM β-lactamase has a 106-fold or more increased catalytic center activity. In structural terms, the class A β-lactamases have lost the four-stranded β-sheet at the surface of the all-α-domain; they have acquired an additional α-helix at the amino-terminal end of the polypeptide chain and a specifically designed Ω-loop at the entry of the active site. Essentially, however, the overall polypeptide fold has been maintained. Another possible evolutionary pathway that retains the activity toward peptide substrates would be the acquisition of membrane-associated carboxyl-terminal amphiphilic α-helices, giving rise to the membrane-bound monofunctional dd-carboxypeptidases/PBPs. Finally, fusion of the acylserine transferase polypeptide to the carboxyl-terminal end of other polypeptide chains may have given rise to the membrane-bound multimodular PBPs. The acylserine transferase/penicillin-binding module of PBP2x of S. pneumoniae (Protein Data Bank code 1PMD) has the signature fold topology and active site of the K15 enzyme. But it also possesses two inserts that form an additional groove at the surface of the module, and the head of the non-penicillin-binding module, which is shaped like a pair of sugar tongs, fits into the non-catalytic groove of the acylserine transferase (20Pares S. Mouz N. Pétillot Y. Hackenbeck R. Dideberg O. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The structurally related K15 dd-transpeptidase/PBP,dd-carboxypeptidases/PBPs, and serine β-lactamases fulfill different functions and catalyze distinct reactions (albeit exhibiting a similar catalytic mechanism). They illustrate the concept according to which proteins unrelated in sequence and function may diverge from a common ancestor and new enzyme functions may evolve by local structural changes while retaining the same basic fold. The question of which structural features determine the different functionalities (peptide bond synthesis versus hydrolysis, penicillin binding versus hydrolysis) and vastly different kinetic properties of the monofunctional penicilloyl-serine transferases remains open."
https://openalex.org/W1983675683,"Apolipophorin III (apoLp-III) from Locusta migratoria is an exchangeable apolipoprotein that binds reversibly to lipid surfaces. In the lipid-free state this 164-residue protein exists as a bundle of five elongated amphipathic α-helices. Upon lipid binding, apoLp-III undergoes a significant conformational change, resulting in exposure of its hydrophobic interior to the lipid environment. On the basis of x-ray crystallographic data (Breiter, D. R., Kanost, M. R., Benning, M. M., Wesenberg, G., Law, J. H., Wells, M. A., Rayment, I., and Holden, H. M. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 603–608), it was proposed that hydrophobic residues, present in loops that connect helices 1 and 2 (Leu-32 and Leu-34) and helices 3 and 4 (Leu-95), may function in initiation of lipid binding. To examine this hypothesis, mutant apoLp-IIIs were designed wherein the three Leu residues were replaced by Arg, individually or together. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and temperature and guanidine hydrochloride denaturation studies showed that the mutations did not cause major changes in secondary structure content or stability. In lipid binding assays, addition of apoLp-III to phospholipid vesicles caused a rapid clearance of vesicle turbidity due to transformation to discoidal complexes. L34R and L32R/L34R/L95R apoLp-IIIs displayed a much stronger interaction with lipid vesicles than wild-type apoLp-III. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the mutant apoLp-IIIs retained their ability to bind to lipoprotein particles. However, in lipoprotein competition binding assays, the mutants displayed an impaired ability to initiate a binding interaction when compared with wild-type apoLp-III. The data indicate that the loops connecting helices 1 and 2 and helices 3 and 4 are critical regions in the protein, contributing to recognition of hydrophobic defects on lipoprotein surfaces by apoLp-III. Apolipophorin III (apoLp-III) from Locusta migratoria is an exchangeable apolipoprotein that binds reversibly to lipid surfaces. In the lipid-free state this 164-residue protein exists as a bundle of five elongated amphipathic α-helices. Upon lipid binding, apoLp-III undergoes a significant conformational change, resulting in exposure of its hydrophobic interior to the lipid environment. On the basis of x-ray crystallographic data (Breiter, D. R., Kanost, M. R., Benning, M. M., Wesenberg, G., Law, J. H., Wells, M. A., Rayment, I., and Holden, H. M. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 603–608), it was proposed that hydrophobic residues, present in loops that connect helices 1 and 2 (Leu-32 and Leu-34) and helices 3 and 4 (Leu-95), may function in initiation of lipid binding. To examine this hypothesis, mutant apoLp-IIIs were designed wherein the three Leu residues were replaced by Arg, individually or together. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and temperature and guanidine hydrochloride denaturation studies showed that the mutations did not cause major changes in secondary structure content or stability. In lipid binding assays, addition of apoLp-III to phospholipid vesicles caused a rapid clearance of vesicle turbidity due to transformation to discoidal complexes. L34R and L32R/L34R/L95R apoLp-IIIs displayed a much stronger interaction with lipid vesicles than wild-type apoLp-III. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the mutant apoLp-IIIs retained their ability to bind to lipoprotein particles. However, in lipoprotein competition binding assays, the mutants displayed an impaired ability to initiate a binding interaction when compared with wild-type apoLp-III. The data indicate that the loops connecting helices 1 and 2 and helices 3 and 4 are critical regions in the protein, contributing to recognition of hydrophobic defects on lipoprotein surfaces by apoLp-III. Exchangeable apolipoproteins are important plasma proteins that bind reversibly to lipoproteins, a process triggered by changes in lipoprotein particle composition. Binding of exchangeable apolipoproteins serves to maintain the structural integrity of lipoproteins as they undergo modification of their lipid content. Apolipoproteins also carry out other functions as follows: apolipoprotein (apo) 1The abbreviations used are: apo, apolipoprotein; apoLp-III, apolipophorin III; DMPC, dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine; DMPG, dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol; LDL, low density lipoprotein; PL-C, phospholipase C; WT, wild-type. E serves as a ligand for cell surface lipoprotein receptors (1Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), apoC-II activates lipoprotein lipase, and apoA-I modulates lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity (2Dolphin P.J. Rosseneu M. Structure and Function of Apolipoproteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 295-362Google Scholar). Exchangeable apolipoproteins are characterized by an abundance of amphipathic α-helices, which confer lipid binding properties to these proteins (3Segrest J.P. Garber D.W. Brouillette C.G. Harvey S.C. Anantharamaiah G.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 303-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apolipophorin III (apoLp-III) is an invertebrate exchangeable apolipoprotein that binds reversibly to neutral lipid-enriched lipoprotein particles (4Van der Horst D.J. Biochim. Biophys.

X-ray crystallography data showed that the lipid-free form of apoLp-III from Locusta migratoria is composed of a bundle of five amphipathic antiparallel α-helices (7Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R.

For the most part, hydrophobic amino acid residues are buried inside the protein, stabilized by helix-helix interactions (9Narayanaswami V. Weers P.M.M. Bogerd J. Kooiman F.P. Kay C.M. Scraba D.G. Van der Horst D.J. Ryan R.O. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11822-11830Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 11Wang J. Narayanaswami V. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This helix-bundle organization resembles that of the 22-kDa N-terminal domain of human apoE (12Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) as well as that of Manduca sexta apoLp-III (13Wang J. Gagné S.M. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O.

Exchangeable apolipoproteins are predicted to undergo a conformational change during the transition from a lipid-free to a lipid-bound form (7Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G.

J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 913-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For apoLp-III, it has been hypothesized that the protein opens about hinged loops and spreads out onto hydrophobic surfaces (7Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This conformational adaptation allows contact of hydrophobic faces of amphipathic α-helices with the lipid surface. Based on structural data, it has been proposed that apoLp-III recognizes potential lipid surface-binding sites via one of its ends (16Kawooya J.K. Meredith S.C. Wells M.A. Kézdy F.J. Law J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13588-13591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the loops connecting the helices (7Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The loops connecting helices 1 and 2 (loop A) and helices 3 and 4 (loop C) possess hydrophobic character (see Fig. 1). Sequence alignment of apoLp-IIIs from different species indicates that the Leu residues in these loops are conserved (17Smith A.F. Owen L.M. Strobel L.M. Chen H. Kanost M.R. Hanneman E. Wells M.A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1976-1984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data have led to the hypothesis that they function as a “hydrophobic sensor” (18Soulages J.L. Salamon Z. Wells M.A. Tollin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5650-5654Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We have used site-directed mutagenesis to test this hypothesis by substituting hydrophobic residues in the putative “sensor” loops ofL. migratoria apoLp-III. Characterization of lipid and lipoprotein binding properties of wild-type and mutant apoLp-IIIs provide evidence that the Leu residues in loops A and C function in initiation of lipoprotein binding. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the pALTER system (Promega, Madison, WI). The cDNA for apoLp-III present in pET22b(+) (apoLp-III/pET construct (10Weers P.M.M. Wang J. Van der Horst D.J. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)) was digested with EcoRI and XbaI, isolated by extraction from 0.8% agarose gels, and subcloned into the pALTER-1 vector (which is ampicillin-sensitive and tetracycline-resistant). The resulting apoLp-III/pALTER construct was used as template DNA for site-directed mutagenesis reactions. Primers, designed to substitute Arg for Leu-32, Leu-34, or Leu-95, were added to alkali-denatured template DNA together with ampicillin repair and tetracycline knockout primers. All primers were phosphorylated. The annealing reaction was carried out at 75 °C for 5 min and cooled slowly to room temperature (∼45 min). T4 DNA polymerase and ligase were added, and the incubation was continued for 90 min at 37 °C. High efficiency ES1301mutS Escherichia coli cells were transformed with 2.5 μl of the reaction mix and grown overnight in LB medium with 125 μg/ml ampicillin. This culture was used for a plasmid miniprep, and the extracted DNA was used to transform JM109 cells. DNA was extracted from transformed JM109 cells and subsequently sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52766) Google Scholar) to verify the desired mutations. DNA from a positive clone was digested with EcoRI and XbaI, and the apoLp-III insert was subcloned back into the original pET22b(+) vector. Finally, the mutated apoLp-III/pET constructs were used to transform BL21 (DE3) E. colicells. ApoLp-III was expressed in E. coli BL21 cells harboring the apoLp-III/pET vector as described (10Weers P.M.M. Wang J. Van der Horst D.J. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The purity of the apoLp-III preparation was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analytical reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. 3H-ApoLp-III was obtained by growing E. coliharboring the apoLp-III/pET construct in 50 ml of M9 minimal medium at 37 °C. When the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6, apoLp-III expression was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (2 mmfinal concentration). The cells were further grown at 30 °C for 30 min after which 150 μCi of a tritiated amino acid mixture was added (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Oakville, Ontario, Canada). The cells were grown for another 4.5 h and pelleted by centrifugation. The cell-free supernatant, which is highly enriched in recombinant apoLp-III (10Weers P.M.M. Wang J. Van der Horst D.J. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), was dialyzed against 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and concentrated 10-fold by ultrafiltration. A typical 50-ml culture yielded 4 mg of protein with a specific activity of 6 × 106 dpm/mg. A Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter, interfaced to an Epson Equity 386/25 computer controlled by Jasco software, was used to analyze the α-helical content of mutant and wild-type (WT) apoLp-IIIs and to monitor temperature- or guanidine hydrochloride-induced denaturation (8Weers P.M.M. Kay C.M. Oikawa K. Wientzek M. Van der Horst D.J. Ryan R.O. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3617-3624Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A modified Contin program by Provencher and Glöckner (20Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar), which contains poly-l-glutamate as a helical reference standard, was used to estimate the α-helical content of the proteins. Binding of apoLp-III to dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) or dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) vesicles was monitored by 90° light scattering. ApoLp-III has the ability to transform phospholipid vesicles to protein-lipid disc complexes. This process, which results in a significant reduction in size of the particles, can be monitored spectroscopically. To prepare multilamellar vesicles of DMPC or DMPG (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Alabaster, AL), the phospholipid was dissolved in chloroform:methanol (3:1, v/v) and dried under a stream of N2. Further dryness was achieved under vacuum for at least 4 h. The dried lipid sample was dispersed in pre-warmed buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2; 150 mm NaCl; 0.5 mm EDTA) to a final lipid concentration of 10 mg/ml and vortexed for 1 min. From this solution, small unilamellar vesicles (∼200 nm in diameter) were prepared by extrusion using 200-nm filters (21MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.Ph.M. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). A Perkin-Elmer spectrofluorometer (model LS 50B) was used to monitor phospholipid vesicle clearance as a result of association with exchangeable apolipoproteins (22Pownall H.J. Massey J.B. Kusserow S.K. Gotto Jr., A.M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1183-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 600 nm with a slit width of 3 nm. The temperature of the cuvette holder was maintained at 23.9 °C (DMPC) or 23 °C (DMPG), and all solutions were preincubated at these temperatures. Lipid vesicles (250 μg) were added to 1 ml of buffer and equilibrated for 10 min in the cuvette holder. Specified apoLp-IIIs (250 μg of protein for DMPC assays and 10 μg for DMPG assays) were then added, mixed for 10 s, and the change in light scattering monitored as a function of time. Apolipoprotein binding to spherical lipoproteins was investigated using the assay system described by Liu et al. (23Liu H. Scraba D.G. Ryan R.O. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Phospholipase C (PL-C)-mediated hydrolysis of the phosphatidylcholine component of human low density lipoprotein (LDL) results in accumulation of diacylglycerol in the monolayer, which leads to lipoprotein particle aggregation and development of sample turbidity (24Suits A.G. Chait A. Aviram M. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2713-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although PL-C-mediated LDL aggregation is irreversible, it can be prevented by inclusion of amphipathic exchangeable apolipoproteins in the incubation. In the present study, LDL (50 μg of protein, isolated by sequential density ultracentrifugation (25Schumaker V.N. Puppione D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar)) was incubated with 0.16 units of Bacillus cereus PL-C (Sigma) (1 unit liberates 1 μmol of water-soluble organic phosphorus from egg yolkl-α-phosphatidylcholine per min at pH 7.3 at 37 °C) in the presence or absence of 40 μg of apoLp-III in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2) at 37 °C. At indicated time points sample absorbance at 340 nm was determined. A variation of the assay described above was used to compare the abilities of WT and mutant apoLp-III to initiate a stable binding interaction with PL-C-treated LDL. LDL (250 μg of protein) was treated with 0.88 units of PL-C in the presence of 3H-WT recombinant apoLp-III (250 μg of total culture medium protein) and indicated amounts of unlabeled competitor (WT or mutant) apoLp-III for 40 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of KBr (2.8 m final concentration) and EDTA (3.5 mm final concentration) (26Little C. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 725-730Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The LDL fraction was re-isolated by KBr density gradient ultracentrifugation and 3H-WT apoLp-III bound to LDL determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) and the specific activity expressed as dpm/mg protein. Loop regions that connect helices 1 and 2 and helices 3 and 4 in the globular α-helix bundle conformation of L. migratoria apoLp-III span residues 32–37 (loop A) and residues 88–96 (loop C). These loops possess hydrophobic character and have been suggested to interact with surface-localized diacylglycerol in lipoproteins to initiate stable binding (7Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, specific leucine residues in the loops were converted to arginine, L32R, L34R, or L95R. 2The numbering of apoLp-III starts with the first Arg residue of apoLp-IIIa. ApoLp-IIIa is the mature protein resulting from signal peptidase cleavage of the preprotein. A slow removal of the first two residues (Arg-Pro) is known to occur after secretion into the hemolymph (49Van der Horst D.J. Van Doorn J.M. Voshol H. Kanost M.R. Ziegler R. Beenakkers A.M. Th. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 50Weers P.M.M. Van Baal J. Van Doorn J.M. Ziegler R. Van der Horst D.J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). All recombinant proteins used in the present study bear the two initial residues. A fourth mutant, where all the three Leu residues were mutated to Arg (L32R/L34R/L95R, referred to as the triple mutant), was also designed. The precise location of the mutations are depicted in Fig. 1. Before conducting functional analysis of the mutant apolipoproteins, their structural properties were characterized. CD spectroscopy revealed that each of the mutants possess a high α-helical content (approximately 75%, results not shown). In temperature-induced denaturation studies monitored by CD, it was observed that WT apoLp-III showed an increase in content of random coil at 40 °C with a maximum reached at 70 °C. Upon cooling, the protein regains its helical structure indicating the process is reversible. Plots of ellipticity as a function of temperature revealed a 55 °C midpoint of temperature-induced denaturation. A similar reversible denaturation was observed for the mutant apoLp-IIIs, although lower denaturation midpoints were found for L32R, L34R, and the triple mutant (Table I). Introduction of Arg in positions 32 and 34 resulted in a slight decrease in the midpoint of GdnHCl-induced denaturation and corresponding ΔGDH2Ovalues, whereas substitution of Leu-95 by Arg did not result in any significant differences when compared with recombinant WT apoLp-III. Although variations in midpoints of temperature and GdnHCl denaturation occurred in the mutants, the values observed were in the range of other exchangeable apolipoproteins, i.e. the homologous M. sexta apoLp-III (see Table I) and human apoA-II ( ΔGDH2O= 1.0 kcal/mol (28Reynolds J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6013-6015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Thus, we conclude that the mutations introduced did not cause major changes in secondary structure content or stability.Table IBiophysical properties of WT and mutant apoLp-IIIsApoLp-IIITm[GdnHC1]½ΔGDH2O°Cmkcal/molWT55.00.612.68L32R49.40.441.56L34R49.60.431.51L95R54.50.602.67L32R/L34R/L95R45.60.331.77M. sexta aFor comparison, the data of M. sextaapoLp-III are shown (27).520.361.29Tm is the midpoint of temperature-induced denaturation (by ellipticity at 221 nm); [GdnHC1]½ is the molar concentration of guanidine hydrochloride required to give a 50% decrease in ellipticity at 221 nm; ΔGDH2O, the free energy of unfolding in the absence of guanidine hydrochloride, was determined according to Pace (52Pace N.C.

When exchangeable apolipoproteins are mixed with unilamellar phospholipid vesicles at their transition temperature, discoidal protein-lipid complexes are formed (29Surewicz W. Epand R.M. Pownall H.J. Hiu S.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16191-16197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This process can be monitored by light scattering spectroscopy since the turbid vesicle solution (∼200 nm in diameter) is clarified upon transformation to discoidal particles (∼14 nm in diameter (8Weers P.M.M. Kay C.M. Oikawa K. Wientzek M. Van der Horst D.J. Ryan R.O. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3617-3624Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)). Two different phospholipid vesicles were examined as follows: negatively charged DMPG and zwitterionic DMPC. As shown in Fig. 2A, WT apoLp-III causes clearance of DMPG vesicle suspensions, whereas in the absence of apolipoproteins DMPG vesicles remain turbid. All single mutant apoLp-IIIs were able to cause DMPG vesicle clearance at 2–6-fold higher rates than WT apoLp-III, which required 95 s to achieve 50% of maximal clearance (t½, see TableII). The triple mutant was 19-fold more efficient than WT apoLp-III in its ability to cause clearance (t½ ∼5 s). Also, L32R and L34R apoLp-IIIs, with mutations in loop A, showed a more rapid interaction with DMPG vesicles than L95R apoLp-III (in loop C). To characterize further the effect of charge-charge interactions between phospholipid vesicles and the different mutants, clearance assays with zwitterionic DMPC vesicles were carried out. WT apoLp-III-induced clearance of DMPC vesicle turbidity is a slower process compared with DMPG, as judged by its higher t½ (455 s), and the higher protein:lipid ratio (Fig. 2B). A stronger interaction of apolipoprotein for DMPG compared with DMPC has also been observed for human apoA-I (29Surewicz W. Epand R.M. Pownall H.J. Hiu S.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16191-16197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The clearance rates varied with each mutant, with L34R and the triple mutant displaying the most effective clearance activity. L32R and L95R apoLp-IIIs showed rates of clearance similar to WT apoLp-III.Table IIEffect of apoLp-III on phospholipid vesicle clearanceApoLp-IIIDMPG t½DMPCt½ssWT95455L32R16248L34R1732L95R47700Triple mutant5130Time required for a 50% reduction of sample turbidity (t½) of a mixture of 250 μg of DMPG or DMPC vesicles and WT or mutant apoLp-IIIs. Apolipoprotein (10 μg for DMPG and 250 μg for DMPC) was added to the vesicle preparation, and after mixing, sample turbidity was monitored by 90° light scattering in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (excitation and emission wavelengths set at 600 nm). Open table in a new tab Time required for a 50% reduction of sample turbidity (t½) of a mixture of 250 μg of DMPG or DMPC vesicles and WT or mutant apoLp-IIIs. Apolipoprotein (10 μg for DMPG and 250 μg for DMPC) was added to the vesicle preparation, and after mixing, sample turbidity was monitored by 90° light scattering in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (excitation and emission wavelengths set at 600 nm). The ability of WT and mutant apoLp-IIIs to bind to hydrophobic defects on a spherical lipoprotein surface was examined (Fig. 3). Treatment of isolated human LDL with PL-C creates surface-localized diacylglycerol, which destabilizes the LDL particle. This unstable, modified LDL tends to aggregate, resulting in sample turbidity which can be followed turbidimetrically. Inclusion of WT apoLp-III in the incubation prevents aggregation due to its ability to bind to the modified LDL surface (23Liu H. Scraba D.G. Ryan R.O. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the present study, WT and mutant apoLp-IIIs (L32R, L34R, and L95R) conferred complete protection against PL-C-induced LDL aggregation. The triple mutant, however, lost some of its ability to protect after extended incubation times. Control incubations of LDL without PL-C demonstrated no change in absorbance, indicating that LDL alone was stable under the conditions employed. We conclude that each of the four mutant apoLp-IIIs are capable of binding to lipolyzed LDL. In order to compare the relative ability of WT and mutant apoLp-IIIs to initiate lipid binding, a competition binding assay was employed. In this case, PL-C treated LDL was incubated simultaneously with tritiated WT apoLp-III and a given unlabeled apoLp-III. These two “species” of apoLp-III then compete for binding sites created on the surface of LDL. The reaction was stopped after 40 min, a time point where WT apoLp-III fully protects LDL from aggregation. In experiments comparing the effect of increasing amounts of unlabeled WT competitor, a concentration-dependent reduction of LDL bound3H-apoLp-III was observed (Fig. 4). Significant reductions in the relative amount of 3H-apoLp-III bound to LDL were observed using 50–400 μg of unlabeled recombinant WT apoLp-III. Thus, 250 μg of unlabeled competitor apolipoprotein was used in subsequent assays comparing WT and mutant apoLp-IIIs. Inclusion of 250 μg of unlabeled WT apoLp-III caused reduction of LDL bound 3H-WT apoLp-III from 100 to 16%. However, equivalent amounts of L32R, L34R, or L95R apoLp-IIIs were less effective competitors (Fig. 5). With these proteins LDL-associated radioactivity was reduced to 41 ± 7% (L32R), 43 ± 6% (L34R), and 53 ± 5% (L95R) under the conditions employed. These values are significantly different (p< 0.01) from that observed for WT apoLp-III, with little difference among the single mutants. The triple mutant showed a strongly decreased ability to compete with 3H-WT apoLp-III for binding sites created by PL-C, suggesting a cumulative effect of the mutations on its ability to initiate lipoprotein binding. When the x-ray structure of L. migratoria apoLp-III was solved (7Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), one of the questions that arose related to the mode of interaction of this globular α-helix bundle protein with lipoproteins. It was postulated that neutral lipid accumulation on the surface of lipoproteins triggers binding of apoLp-III via conformational opening of the bundle (7Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Such an opening (helices 1, 2, and 5 moving away from helices 3 and 4) was proposed to involve putative hinge domains (loops B and D in Fig. 1). In this model, apoLp-III exposes its interior to interact with a lipid surface but can re-adopt the closed conformation following release from the lipoprotein surface. A similar mechanism has been proposed for the N-terminal domain of human apoE where lipi"
https://openalex.org/W2016436048,"The substituted cysteine-accessibility method and two sulfhydryl-specific reagents, the methane-thiosulfonate derivative 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA) and the α2-adrenergic receptor (α2-AR) agonist chloroethylclonidine (CEC), were used to determine the relative accessibility of engineered cysteines in the fifth transmembrane domain of the human α2A-AR (Hα2A). The second-order rate constants for the reaction of the receptor with MTSEA and CEC were determined with the wild type Hα2A (cysteine at position 201) and receptor mutants containing accessible cysteines at other positions within the binding-site crevice (positions 197, 200, and 204). The rate of reaction of CEC was similar to that of MTSEA at residues Cys-197, Cys-201, and Cys-204. The rate of reaction of CEC with Cys-200, however, was more than 5 times that of MTSEA, suggesting that these compounds may interact with two different receptor conformations. MTSEA, having no recognition specificity for the receptor, likely reacts with the predominant inactive receptor conformation (R), whereas the agonist CEC may stabilize and react preferentially with the active receptor conformation (R*). This hypothesis was consistent with three-dimensional receptor-ligand models, which further suggest that α2A-AR activation may involve the clockwise rotation of transmembrane domain 5. The substituted cysteine-accessibility method and two sulfhydryl-specific reagents, the methane-thiosulfonate derivative 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA) and the α2-adrenergic receptor (α2-AR) agonist chloroethylclonidine (CEC), were used to determine the relative accessibility of engineered cysteines in the fifth transmembrane domain of the human α2A-AR (Hα2A).

Cotecchia S. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1095: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The TM regions are predicted to be α-helical and to form a water-accessible crevice containing the binding site for receptor ligands (2Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Some of the amino acid residues forming the surface of this crevice directly interact with α2-AR agonists and/or antagonists, whereas some others in the TM domains may affect ligand binding indirectly (3Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 4Javitch J.A. Fu D. Chen J. Karlin A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 825-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). G-protein-coupled receptors are thought to exist in an equilibrium between two (or more) conformations or allosteric states, R and R* (5Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand, the inactive state R predominates. Agonist binding stabilizes the receptor protein in its active state R*, promoting its coupling with G-proteins. The resulting G-protein activation initiates a cascade of intracellular events leading to physiological responses. Recently, a technique utilizing charged methanethiosulfonate derivatives to probe the accessibility of substituted cysteine residues has been used to study the structure of the dopamine D2 and the β2-adrenergic receptors (4Javitch J.A. Fu D. Chen J. Karlin A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 825-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 6Fu D. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Chen J. Javitch J.A.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16433-16439Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This method identifies residues that form the surface of the binding-site crevice by replacing consecutive amino acid residues in the membrane-spanning segments with cysteine, one at a time. The sulfhydryl side chain of a cysteine can face the water-accessible binding-site crevice, the interior of the protein, or the lipid bilayer. Sulfhydryls facing the binding-site crevice react rapidly with sulfhydryl-specific methanethiosulfonate derivatives such as 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA), with formation of a covalent bond with the free sulfhydryl group of an accessible cysteine residue (4Javitch J.A. Fu D. Chen J. Karlin A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 825-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 8Javitch J.A. Fu D. Chen J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16433-16439Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). MTSEA has no preference for receptor conformations, and it reacts, therefore, with the predominant (inactive) form of the receptor (R). In this method, agonists cannot be used to stabilize and thereby to study the structure of the active receptor species, because the presence of an agonist in the binding pocket would interfere with the access of MTSEA to the engineered cysteines. The activated state of the receptor (R*) can, however, be detected with MTSEA by using a constitutively active receptor mutant (7Javitch J.A. Fu D. Liapakis G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18546-18549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This approach, combined with molecular modeling, has suggested rotation and/or tilting of the TM6 segment of the β2-AR as a consequence of receptor activation (7Javitch J.A. Fu D. Liapakis G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18546-18549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We recently used the agonist chloroethylclonidine (CEC) to map the structure of TM5 of the human α2A-AR with a modified substituted cysteine-accessibility method (9Marjamäki A. Pihlavisto M. Cockcroft V. Heinonen P. Savola J.-M. Scheinin M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The reactive aziridinium ion derivative of CEC forms a covalent bond with the sulfhydryl side chain of a cysteine exposed in the binding-site crevice and accessible to CEC. This method has the advantage of introducing recognition specificity by using a thiol-reactive group incorporated into an affinity ligand of the target receptor. In functional studies, CEC irreversibly activates α2-AR, both prejunctionally in the rat vas deferens and postjunctionally in the dog saphenous vein (10Bültmann R. Starke K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,11Guimaraes S. Paiva M.Q. Pereira O. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 1326-1330PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the compound is covalently tethered to an endogenous cysteine near the binding site. In our previous study, TM5 of Hα2A was shown to be consistent with an α-helix with residues Val-197, Cys-201, and Ser-204, pointing into the binding-site crevice, residues Ile-198, Ser-199, Ile-202, and Gly-203, facing the lipid bilayer, and Ser-200, pointing partly toward TM4 (9Marjamäki A. Pihlavisto M. Cockcroft V. Heinonen P. Savola J.-M. Scheinin M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the pattern of accessibility to MTSEA in TM5 of the dopamine D2 receptor was not consistent with a fixed α-helical structure for TM5 (8Javitch J.A. Fu D. Chen J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16433-16439Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for these results is that this region changes conformation. Because this region is known to be directly involved in agonist binding and because the intracellular end of TM5 interacts with G-proteins, conformational changes in TM5 may be critical to the activation mechanisms of these receptors. To explore such a conformational change in the Hα2A receptor, we have compared the rates of reaction of the agonist CEC and of MTSEA with accessible cysteines at positions 197, 200, 201, and 204 in TM5 of Hα2A. Nonaccessible cysteines at positions 202 and 203 and a Hα2ASer201 mutant (containing no substituted cysteines) were used as controls. MTSEA reacted with accessible cysteines with the following rank order of reactivity: Cys-200 < Cys-201(wt) < Cys-197 = Cys-204. In contrast, for CEC, the cysteine at position 200 was found to be the most reactive (rank order of the rate constants: Cys-204 = Cys-201(wt) = Cys-197 < Cys-200). Our findings suggest that the agonist CEC and MTSEA may recognize two different receptor conformations, with MTSEA reacting with the predominant inactive form and CEC reacting with the agonist-dependent active conformation of TM5 of Hα2A. Such a hypothesis is consistent with three-dimensional models of the receptor-MTSEA and receptor-CEC complexes. [3H]RX821002 (2-(2-methoxy-1,4-benzodioxan-2-yl)-2-imidazoline) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; specific activity, 56 Ci/mmol). Phentolamine, UK 14,304 (5-bromo-N-(4, 5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-6-quinoxalinamine), and CEC were supplied by Research Biochemicals (Natick, MA). MTSEA was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. (North York, Canada). Cell culture reagents were supplied by Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Other chemicals were of analytical grade and were purchased from commercial suppliers. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed utilizing the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously (9Marjamäki A. Pihlavisto M. Cockcroft V. Heinonen P. Savola J.-M. Scheinin M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The wild type Hα2A and the mutated receptor cDNAs were subcloned into the KpnI/BamHI sites of the expression vector pREP4 (In Vitrogen, NV Leek, The Netherlands). Adherent CHO cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured as reported previously (9Marjamäki A. Pihlavisto M. Cockcroft V. Heinonen P. Savola J.-M. Scheinin M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The pREP4-based expression constructs were transfected into cells using the Lipofectin reagent kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) (9Marjamäki A. Pihlavisto M. Cockcroft V. Heinonen P. Savola J.-M. Scheinin M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)-resistant (550 μg/ml) cell cultures were examined for their ability to bind the α2-AR antagonist [3H]RX821002. The transfected cells chosen for further experiments were subsequently maintained in 200 μg/ml hygromycin B. Ligand binding assays were performed in 50 mm K+-phosphate buffer (pH 7.4 at 21 °C) as described previously (9Marjamäki A. Pihlavisto M. Cockcroft V. Heinonen P. Savola J.-M. Scheinin M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 12Halme M. Sjöholm B. Savola J.-M. Scheinin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Six large culture flasks (175 cm2) of CHO cells were harvested into chilled phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, washed, suspended in 2.5 ml of ice-cold 50 mm K+-phosphate buffer (pH 7.4 at 21 °C), and homogenized with an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer (model T25, Janke & Kunkel, Staufen, Germany; setting 9500 rpm, twice for 10 s). Aliquots (45 μl) of cell homogenate were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Five μl of freshly prepared CEC or MTSEA dilutions were added to each vial to reach the appropriate final concentration. Reactions took place at room temperature for 15 min (CEC) or 2 min (MTSEA); the reaction mixtures were then diluted 20-fold with 50 mm K+-phosphate buffer (pH 7.4 at 21 °C). Residual α2-AR binding was assessed by incubating the homogenate (30–60 μg of protein/assay tube) with 2.5 nm[3H]RX821002. Nonspecific binding was determined by including 10 μm phentolamine in parallel assays. The second-order rate constant (k) for the reaction of CEC or MTSEA with wild type Hα2A and each susceptible mutant was estimated by determining the extent of the reaction after a fixed time, 15 min (CEC) or 2 min (MTSEA), with seven concentrations of CEC (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, and 500 μm) or MTSEA (5, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 μm) as previously reported (8Javitch J.A. Fu D. Chen J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16433-16439Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The fraction remaining of the initial total binding, Y, was fit to (span × e -kct) + plateau, where k is the second-order rate constant (m−1s−1), c is the concentration of CEC or MTSEA (m), t is the reaction time (s), and plateau is the fraction of binding remaining at saturating concentrations of reagent. For Cys-197, Cys-200, and Cys-204, the highest concentration of MTSEA and of CEC produced nearly complete inhibition of ligand binding (see below). Thus, for all of these fits, the plateau was set to a constant value of 0, and the span was correspondingly fixed to 1 because binding in the absence of added reagent is by definition 100%. The plateau was not fixed for the other CEC fits, because the data did not show complete inhibition at the highest concentration of CEC tested. For these fits the span was set equal to 1 − plateau. The results were analyzed with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Extracellular acidification rates were measured using the Cytosensor® Microphysiometer (Molecular Devices Corp., Menlo Park, CA) (13McConnell H.M. Owicki J.C. Parce J.W. Miller D.L. Baxter G.T. Wada H.G. Pitchford S. Science. 1992; 257: 1906-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). CHO cells were seeded into 12-mm capsule cups at 3 × 105 cells/cup and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 20 h. The capsule cups were loaded into the sensor chambers and perfused with running medium (bicarbonate-free α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 26 mm NaCl, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. CEC and UK 14,304 were diluted with the running medium. Following base-line stabilization, cells were exposed to agonists for 15 min, and a 30-min wash period was employed between successive agonist exposures. The alterations in the extracellular acidification rate were calculated as the difference between the maximum effect after agonist exposure and the average of three measurements taken immediately before agonist addition. The Hα2A receptor model contains seven transmembrane helices, and it was built using the computer program MODELLER 4.0 (14Šali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10551) Google Scholar). The model is based on a template (15Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) generated using electron density of the frog rhodopsin (16Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) and the analysis of ∼500 sequences of G-protein-coupled receptors (15Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Receptor models for each mutant were generated by replacing corresponding residues at positions 197, 200, or 204, one at a time, with a cysteine, and by replacing Cys-201 with a serine. CEC was docked manually in the binding-site crevice into a position that allows hydrogen bonding between the protonated nitrogen atom in the imidazoline ring of CEC and Asp-113 in TM3 of the receptor. Simultaneously, a covalent bond was created between CEC and the cysteine residue in TM5. Each receptor-CEC complex was then energy-minimized using CHARMm (17Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13963) Google Scholar) (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA) using harmonic constraints for backbone atoms to maintain the helical structures of the TMs. Energy minimizations were also performed without constraints to completely relax the structure of the complex. MTSEA was docked into the same region of the binding-site crevice as CEC, and a disulfide bond between the sulfur atom of MTSEA and the cysteine residue of the receptor was created. The introduced mutations were confirmed, and the absence of secondary mutations was verified by dideoxy sequencing of double-stranded DNA. Mutated and wild type receptors were expressed in CHO cells. Hygromycin B-resistant cell cultures were examined for their ability to bind the α2-AR antagonist radioligand [3H]RX821002. Three clones from each transfection expressing the expected receptor were isolated for the preliminary experiments, and one cell line from each transfection was expanded for further experiments and subsequently maintained in 200 μg/ml hygromycin B. Saturation isotherms of [3H]RX821002 binding, and LIGAND (18McPherson G.A. J. Pharmacol. Methods. 1985; 14: 213-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar)-derivedKd (receptor affinity), and Bmax (receptor density) values were determined in three separate experiments performed in triplicate for each cell line. The expression levels of two point-mutated receptors, Hα2ASer201Cys202 and Hα2ASer201Cys203, were 451 ± 10 and 2922 ± 91 fmol/mg of protein, respectively. The affinities of these two mutants for the α2-AR antagonist [3H]RX821002 were comparable with the Hα2Awt receptor (Kd values for Hα2Awt, Hα2ASer201Cys202, and Hα2ASer201Cys203 were 0.60 ± 0.02, 0.25 ± 0.02, and 0.68 ± 0.02 nm, respectively) (TableI). A similar characterization of CHO cells expressing Hα2Awt(Cys201), Hα2Ser201Cys197, Hα2ASer201Cys200, and Hα2ASer201Cys204 was reported previously (9Marjamäki A. Pihlavisto M. Cockcroft V. Heinonen P. Savola J.-M. Scheinin M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and is also shown in Table I. In all investigated cell lines expressing wt and mutant receptors, the addition of CEC to competition binding assays inhibited specific binding of 2.5 nm[3H]RX821002 with steep monophasic competition curves (9Marjamäki A. Pihlavisto M. Cockcroft V. Heinonen P. Savola J.-M. Scheinin M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The concentration of CEC that inhibited specific [3H]RX821002 binding by 50% (IC50) was used to calculate apparent Ki values (inhibition constant) according to the Cheng-Prusoff equation (19Cheng Y.-E. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12283) Google Scholar). Competition binding analysis of the control mutants Hα2ASer201, Hα2ASer201Cys202, and Hα2ASer201Cys203 containing no exposed cysteines in the binding cavity in our receptor model, indicated that the lack of irreversible inhibition of binding by CEC in these receptors was not due to a lack of binding affinity but rather to the absence of accessible cysteine residues on the surface of the binding-site crevice (apparent Ki = 260 ± 32, 345 ± 38, and 808 ± 37 nm, respectively) (TableI).Table IPharmacological characterization of CHO cells expressing wild type and mutated human α2A-ARsCell line[3H]RX821002CECBmaxKdApparent Kifmol/mg proteinnmnmCHO-Hα2Awt(Cys201)595 ± 20.60 ± 0.02578 ± 39CHO-Hα2ASer2014736 ± 2340.42 ± 0.08260 ± 32CHO-Hα2ASer201Cys197295 ± 220.53 ± 0.0595 ± 3CHO-Hα2ASer201Cys2002146 ± 3063.34 ± 0.5156 ± 6CHO-Hα2ASer201Cys202451 ± 100.25 ± 0.02345 ± 38CHO-Hα2ASer201Cys2032922 ± 910.68 ± 0.02808 ± 37CHO-Hα2ASer201Cys2044009 ± 1172.71 ± 0.12191 ± 7LIGAND-derived (18McPherson G.A.

Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A illustrates the inhibition of antagonist binding produced by CEC. Binding to the mutants Cys-197, Cys-200, and Cys-204 is very sensitive to CEC, whereas the mutants Ser-201, Cys-202, and Cys-203 are relatively resistant to CEC, and the wild type receptor Cys-201 shows intermediate sensitivity. The rate and extent of receptor inactivation by CEC with cysteine substitutions for Ile-202 and Gly-203 was comparable with that of Hα2ASer201, which contained no substituted cysteines, suggesting that residues 202 and 203 face the lipid bilayer or are closely packed against other membrane-spanning segments. To quantitate the susceptibility of the engineered cysteines to CEC, the second-order rate constants for reaction with these compounds were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” (TableII). It is apparent from these data (Fig. 1) that Hα2ASer201 is not resistant to the effects of CEC and that it contains, therefore, one or more relatively slowly reacting cysteines. For all of the mutants except Hα2Awt(Cys201), however, the simple single exponential decay function gave a reasonable fit of the CEC data, especially at low concentrations of CEC (Fig. 1A). This is likely the case because Cys-197, Cys-200, and Cys-204 are so reactive and because reaction at these positions produces such a large inhibition of binding that the relatively slowly reacting endogenous cysteines are nearly irrelevant to the resulting pattern of inhibition. For the Hα2wt(Cys201) receptor, however, the plateau determined by this fit was substantially greater than the experimentally determined value, even though the fit is consistent with the inhibition seen at low concentrations of CEC. If the plateau was fixed to 0, however, a single exponential fit provided a gross underestimate of the rate of reaction (data not shown), a conclusion based on the significant inhibition of binding to this receptor observed at even very low concentrations of CEC. The data for the wild type receptor are better fit by a 2-site exponential decay function, but the variation in the rates obtained for the very reactive component for this receptor (and for the other mutants) was too great to make this a reliable method for analyzing the data (data not shown). Thus the value shown in Table IIis an approximation of the rapid rate of reaction with Cys-201, and the remaining inhibition is likely because of reaction with the other more slowly reacting cysteines in Hα2ASer201.Table IISecond-order rate constants (k) of inactivation of the wild type and mutated human α2A-ARs by MTSEA and CECα2A-AR/mutantkMTSEAk(mut)/k(wt)kCECk(mut)/k(wt)k(mut)/kHα2ASer201)CEC/MTSEAm−1s−1m−1s−1Hα2Awt(Cys201)64 ± 31117 ± 5191.8Hα2ASer201NDND13 ± 10.11NDHα2ASer201Cys19791 ± 0.31.4131 ± 201.1101.4Hα2ASer201Cys20049 ± 10.8264 ± 182.3205.4Hα2ASer201Cys202NDND10 ± 10.10.8NDHα2ASer201Cys203NDND20 ± 10.21.5NDHα2ASer201Cys20496 ± 31.5102 ± 40.981.1The data represent the mean ± S.E. of three to six separate experiments performed in triplicate. k(mut)/k(wt) and k(mut)/k(Hα2ASer201) were obtained by dividing each k value by the k determined for the wild type or Hα2ASer201 receptor.

Open table in a new tab The data represent the mean ± S.E. of three to six separate experiments performed in triplicate. k(mut)/k(wt) and k(mut)/k(Hα2ASer201) were obtained by dividing each k value by the k determined for the wild type or Hα2ASer201 receptor. The ratio CEC/MTSEA represents the relative reactivity of CEC and MTSEA at each receptor. ND, not reliably determined. MTSEA inhibited binding to all of the mutants (Fig. 1B), with Cys-202 and Cys-203 being the most resistant, consistent with the relative inaccessibility of these cysteines. The results for the Ser-201 mutant were not accurately described by an exponential decay function; this receptor was relatively resistant to MTSEA up to a concentration of 125 μm but showed quite significant inhibition at higher MTSEA concentrations. Consequently, no estimate for the second-order rate constant of inactivation of this receptor with MTSEA could be computed. The reasons for this unexpected inhibitory pattern remain unclear but may reflect the reactivity of other cysteines present in the Ser-201 background. In Fig. 1B the MTSEA results for the Ser-201, Cys-202, and Cys-203 mutants are presented without curve-fitting. Reasonable single exponential decay fits were obtained for Cys-197, Cys-201, and Cys-204. For Cys-200, the data also show a “lag” at low concentrations, similar but less pronounced than that seen with Ser-201 (see above), and thus the fit is less satisfactory than that seen with the other three reactive residues. This results in an overestimation of the rate of reaction of Cys-200 with MTSEA, although it is impossible to determine the exact rate of reaction of this substituted cysteine in the presence of the Ser-201 background. CEC increased the extracellular acidification rate in CHO cells expressing Hα2Awt in a concentration-dependent and irreversible manner (Fig. 2). After CEC treatment followed by extensive washing, the reversible α2A-AR agonist UK 14,304 was unable to further increase the acidification rate, consistent with the complete reaction of the entire receptor population with the covalently tethered agonist CEC and persistent activation. Exposure of CHO cells expressing Hα2Awt and Hα2ASer201Cys200 receptors to UK 14,304 resulted in reversible increases in the rate of extracellular acidification (Fig. 3). These results confirmed the efficacy of the tethered agonist and the functionality of the mutant receptor. The functionality of this mutant receptor was also shown in a [35S]GTPγS binding assay. 2J.

https://openalex.org/W1982424756,"The dihydrolipoamideS-acetyltransferase (E2) subunit of the maize mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) was postulated to contain a single lipoyl domain based upon molecular mass and N-terminal protein sequence (Thelen, J. J., Miernyk, J. A., and Randall, D. D. (1998) Plant Physiol. 116, 1443–1450). This sequence was used to identify a cDNA from a maize expressed sequence tag data base. The deduced amino acid sequence of the full-length cDNA was greater than 30% identical to other E2s and contained a single lipoyl domain. Mature maize E2 was expressed in Escherichia coliand purified to a specific activity of 191 units mg−1. The purified recombinant protein had a native mass of approximately 2.7 MDa and assembled into a 29-nm pentagonal dodecahedron as visualized by electron microscopy.Immunoanalysis of mitochondrial proteins from various plants, using a monoclonal antibody against the maize E2, revealed 50–54-kDa cross-reacting polypeptides in all samples. A larger protein (76 kDa) was also recognized in an enriched pea mitochondrial PDC preparation, indicating two distinct E2s. The presence of a single lipoyl-domain E2 in Arabidopsis thaliana was confirmed by identifying a gene encoding a hypothetical protein with 62% amino acid identity to the maize homologue. These data suggest that all plant mitochondrial PDCs contain an E2 with a single lipoyl domain. Additionally, A. thaliana and other dicots possess a second E2, which contains two lipoyl domains and is only 33% identical at the amino acid level to the smaller isoform. The reason two distinct E2s exist in dicotyledon plants is uncertain, although the variability between these isoforms, particularly within the subunit-binding domain, suggests different roles in assembly and/or function of the plant mitochondrial PDC. The dihydrolipoamideS-acetyltransferase (E2) subunit of the maize mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) was postulated to contain a single lipoyl domain based upon molecular mass and N-terminal protein sequence (Thelen, J.

The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) 1The abbreviations used are: PDC, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; E1, pyruvate dehydrogenase; E2, dihydrolipoamideS-acetyltransferase; E3, lipoamide dehydrogenase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is a multienzyme complex that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to yield acetyl-CoA, carbon dioxide, and NADH (1Reed L.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1974; 7: 40-56Crossref Scopus (655) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, PDC is located in the mitochondrial matrix. A second PDC isoform in plants has been localized to the plastidial stroma (2Williams M. Randall D.D. Plant Physiol. 1979; 64: 1099-1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Camp P.J. Randall D.D. Plant Physiol. 1985; 77: 571-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both PDC isoforms probably provide acetyl-CoA for fatty acid biosynthesis, but a primary role of the mitochondrial isoform is to link glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid metabolism (reviewed in Ref. 4Luethy M.H. Miernyk J.A. David N.R. Randall D.D. Patel M.S. Roche T.E. Harris R.A. Alpha-Keto Acid Dehydrogenase Complexes. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1996: 71-92Crossref Google Scholar). A minimal PDC is composed of multiple copies of three enzymatic components: pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1, EC 1.2.4.1), dihydrolipoamideS-acetyltransferase (E2, EC 2.3.1.12), and lipoamide dehydrogenase (E3, EC 1.8.1.4) (reviewed in Ref. 5Patel M.S. Roche T.E. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The E1 component catalyzes the decarboxylation of pyruvate via a thiamin pyrophosphate-hydroxyethylidene intermediate and the reductive acetylation of the lipoate covalently bound to a lysine of E2. The E2 component then catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl group to CoA for the formation of acetyl-CoA. Finally, the reduced lipoamide is oxidized by the E3 component to yield NADH. These three reactions are facilitated by the swinging action of the E2 lipoyl domain, enabling active site coupling between the E2-bound E1 and E3 components (6Wallis N.G. Allen M.D. Broadhurst R.W. Lessard I.A.D. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition to the three major catalytic components, mitochondrial PDCs possess a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase and phosphopyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase that regulate the phosphorylation status of PDC (7Thelen J.J.

The E2 subunit forms the core to which all other PDC subunits bind (10Reed L.J. Hackert M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8971-8974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, the oligomeric core contains eight E2 trimers arranged as a cube with octahedral symmetry (11Stephens P.E. Darlison M.G. Lewis H.M. Guest J.R. Eur.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8501-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar and references therein). Starting at the N terminus, an E2 polypeptide contains 1–3 lipoyl subdomains (∼100 residues in length), which are linked together by variable, flexible hinge regions of 20–30 residues. The inner lipoyl domain is adjoined to the E1-binding domain (∼40 residues) by another flexible hinge motif. Finally, a short, hypervariable region of 10–40 residues connects the E1-binding domain with the catalytic/assembly domain of 230 residues. Tightly associated with the E2 core of most eukaryotes is a lower abundance polypeptide termed protein X (17Gopalakrishnan S. Rahmatullah M. Radke G.A. Powers-Greenwood S. Roche T.E. Biochem.

A. 1989; 86: 8732-8736Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) protein X subunits indicate that they are related to E2 subunits, quite possibly diverging from the same ancestor to yield a functionally distinct protein. The human and Saccharomyces cerevisiaeprotein X subunits both have functional lipoyl domains, and the human (but not the S. cerevisiae) homologue appears to have a functional acetyltransferase subdomain. Protein X from Ascaris suum, in contrast, does not contain a lipoyl domain (22Klingbeil M.M. Walker D.J. Arnette R. Sidawy E. Hayton K. Komuniecki P.R. Komuniecki R. J. Biol.

A characteristic common to all protein X subunits is that they can bind the E3 component with higher affinity than the E2 core, suggesting a possible function for this protein and prompting it being renamed the E3-binding protein (17Gopalakrishnan S.

While it is clear that E3-binding proteins are present in animal and fungal PDCs, evidence for an E3-binding protein in plants is indirect and has not yet been confirmed (23Taylor A.E. Cogdell R.J. Lindsay J.G. Planta. 1992; 188: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Previously, the purified maize mitochondrial PDC was shown to contain a single E2 subunit with a mass of 52 kDa (24Thelen J.J. Miernyk J.A. Randall D.D.

Herein we report the molecular cloning of a cDNA encoding the 52-kDa E2 subunit of maize mitochondrial PDC and expression of the functional protein. Etiolated maize (Zea mays L., B73; Illinois Seed Foundation, Urbana, IL) seedlings, pea (Pisum sativum L., cv. Little Marvel), A. thaliana (Columbia), and Kalanchöe daigremontianum seedlings were grown as described in Ref. 27Thelen J.J. Miernyk J.A. Randall D.D. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar. Cucumber (Cucurbis sativus) plants were grown in a growth chamber (10-h photoperiod, 18 °C) for ∼20 days. Mitochondria were isolated from etiolated maize shoots and from the green leaves of the other plants using previously published procedures (28Hayes M.K. Luethy M.H. Elthon T.E.

AZ. mays cDNA encoding a putative E2 subunit was identified from the Pioneer Hi-Bred expressed sequence tag data base using the N-terminal protein sequence (24Thelen J.J. Miernyk J.A. Randall D.D. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 1443-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) for the maize E2 subunit as the search query. Two cDNAs were identified from a 2–3-day root cDNA library using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST; Ref. 32Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). The longer of the two cDNAs was retrieved and sequenced on both strands using AmpliTaq Gold with fluorescent dye-deoxynucleotides according to manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems Incorporated, Foster City, CA). Automated sequencing was performed at the University of Missouri DNA core facility using an ABI model 377 sequencer. Nested deletions were generated using the Erase-A-Base procedure according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Primers DDR 271 (5′-agtctgaattcgccatggtcTCAAGTAGTGCAGAC-3′) and DDR 272 (5′-cagtctgtcgacTCACAGCAGCATTGAA-3′) were used to amplify the open reading frame of the mature maize E2 protein corresponding to the region between 414 and 1721 bp (amino acids 103–542). Restriction sites were engineered into each primer at the 5′-end (lowercase letters) to facilitate subcloning of the PCR amplicon. TheNcoI (DDR 271) and SalI (DDR 272) sites (underscored) were used to subclone the PCR product into pET28b expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The resulting construct encodes for the mature maize E2 polypeptide with an extra Met-Val- at the N terminus. Deletion constructs for mapping the monoclonal antibody epitope were generated by utilizing restriction sites within the cDNA to remove portions of the open reading frame. Since no stop codons were present upstream of the initiating Met, the entire cDNA was subcloned directly into an expression vector with the proper reading frame. Deletions of this original full-length construct were created by digesting the plasmid with HindIII or PstI and then religating. Since both restriction sites are present within the cDNA and the multiple cloning region, the deletions were made to the 3′-end of the cDNA, keeping the reading frame intact. Colonies were screened by agarose gel electrophoresis, and proper size plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression constructs were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells for expression analyses. A single colony of recombinant E. coli BL21(DE3) was inoculated into 20 ml of LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and incubated with shaking at 37 °C overnight. The cells were transferred to 0.5 liters of LB-kanamycin plus 1 mmlipoic acid and shaken at 37 °C until theA600 reached 0.4 (2–4 h). The target gene was induced by isopropyl β-thiogalactoside at a final concentration of 0.4 mm and continued shaking at 37 °C for another 4–8 h. The cells were harvested, resuspended in 60 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100), and disrupted by ultrasonic treatment using three 20-s pulses at 50 watts, while keeping the cell lysate in an ice-water bath. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new centrifuge tube, and 50% polyethylene glycol 6000 was added dropwise to reach 10% final concentration and then placed at 4 °C for 16 h for complete precipitation of protein. The precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min; resuspended in 2 ml of 20 mm TES-KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mmdithiothreitol; clarified at 10,000 × g for 20 min to remove insoluble protein; and then applied to a 10–50% linear glycerol gradient composed of 50 mm TES-KOH, pH 7.5, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm magnesium chloride. The proteins were resolved in the gradient by centrifugation in a SW28 rotor at 25,000 rpm for 16 h. The gradient was fractionated from the bottom, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were assayed by immunoblot analysis with the monoclonal antibody. Peak fractions were pooled; dialyzed against 20 mm TES-KOH, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, for 16 h; and then concentrated using an ultrafiltration membrane (300-kDa cut-off; Amicon, Beverly, MA). The transfer of [1-14C]acetate to dihydrolipoamide from [1-14C]acetyl-CoA was assayed as described previously, with the following modifications (33Randall D.D. Miernyk J.A. Methods Plant Biochem. 1990; 3: 175-192Crossref Google Scholar). In a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube, the following components were combined to the final concentration indicated: 30 mm TES-KOH, pH 7.3, 1.2 mm reduced dihydrolipoamide, 1 mm[1-14C]acetyl-CoA (∼1 μCi). The assay was initiated with purified recombinant protein to reach a final volume of 500 μl and proceeded for 2 min at 25 °C. The [1-14C]acetyldihydrolipoamide was extracted by adding 1 ml of benzene followed by vortexing and centrifugation to separate the phases. The upper benzene phase (0.5 ml) was removed and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Controls without dihydrolipoamide, without recombinant protein, and using boiled protein (5 min) were performed. The nonisotopic transfer of acetate to dihydrolipoamide was assayed using the following variations from a previously described procedure (33Randall D.D. Miernyk J.A. Methods Plant Biochem. 1990; 3: 175-192Crossref Google Scholar). The following components were added in order to a 1-ml quartz cuvette: 50 mm TES-KOH, pH 7.4, 1 mmacetylphosphate, 1 mm dihydrolipoamide, 10 μmCoASH, 20 μm cysteine, 1 unit of recombinant phosphotransacetylase (P-1329; Sigma), and recombinant E2. The formation of acetyldihydrolipoamide was measured by the ΔA232 for 1 min at 25 °C. Background rates, without E2 (<5% of the actual rate), were observed and stabilized after approximately 20 s. The extinction coefficient for the acetyldihydrolipoamide ester bond is 4400 m−1cm−1; however, rates were expressed as ΔA232 due to the potential for formation of undetermined amounts of biacetylated dihydrolipoamide (34Yang D. Song J. Wagenknecht T. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6361-6369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The native size of purified recombinant maize E2 was determined using a Superose 6 column in conjunction with a fast protein liquid chromatography system (FPLC; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The exclusion size of this matrix is approximately 40 MDa for globular proteins; thus, an assembled maize E2 complex (∼2.8 MDa predicted mass) should not pass through the void volume. A 100-μl sample was applied to a column equilibrated with 20 mm TES-KOH, pH 7.4, 30 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, and eluted with the same buffer at 0.5 ml min−1. A calibration curve using high molecular weight standards was used to estimate the size of the protein complex. Purified recombinant maize E2 eluted from the Superose 6 column was diluted to 0.2 mg/ml in the elution buffer for negative staining. Approximately 100 μl of elution buffer was placed on a carbon-coated copper grid as a control. The diluted recombinant protein was also placed on a copper grid for 5 min. Unbound protein was removed from the copper grid, and bound protein was negatively stained with 1.3% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid, pH 7.4, for 5 min at 25 °C. The stain was then removed, and the grid placed in the column of a Hitachi H-600 for visualization. The N-terminal protein sequence of the maize E2 (23Taylor A.E. Cogdell R.J. Lindsay J.G. Planta. 1992; 188: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was used as a search query to identify two cDNAs from a maize EST data base. The two cDNAs were identical except for an extra 42 base pairs on the 5′-end of the cDNA reported herein. The maize E2 cDNA is 1981 base pairs in length containing a 542-amino acid open reading frame with an ATG codon starting at nucleotide 93 and an in-frame stop codon starting at nucleotide 1719. The corresponding polypeptide carries a 107-amino acid mitochondrial targeting peptide immediately N-terminal to the single predicted lipoyl domain. The mature protein starts at Ser108, based upon the similarity of the deduced sequence, -SSSADLPPHQEIGMPSLSPT-, with the experimentally determined amino-terminal sequence, -SNXADLPPHQEIGMPXLSXT- (24Thelen J.J. Miernyk J.A. Randall D.D. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 1443-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The mature protein is 435 amino acids in length with a predicted mass of 46,704 and a pI value of 5.08. The maize E2 polypeptide exhibits 37% overall amino acid identity to the yeast (35Niu X.D. Browning K.S. Behal R.H. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7546-7550Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), 35% identity to the human (36Coppel R.L. McNeilage J. Surh C.D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5412-5417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and plastid (37Mooney B.P. Miernyk J.A. Randall D.D. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) E2 sequences, respectively. In contrast, a hypothetical protein identified from the A. thaliana genome project exhibited 62% amino acid identity with the maize E2. Like the maize E2, this protein contains a single lipoyl domain downstream of a mitochondrial targeting sequence. For simplicity, we will refer to the hypotheticalA. thaliana E2 as isoform 1, since it contains a single lipoyl domain, while the previously identified A. thalianaE2 will be referred to as isoform 2. When the amino acid sequences of the maize and A. thaliana 1 E2s are aligned with other known E2s, it is apparent that they contain the three conserved domains characteristic of this class of enzymes (Fig. 1). The lipoyl domain of the maize E2 is at least 55% similar to the inner lipoyl domain (TableI) but at most 50% similar to the outer lipoyl domain for other eukaryotic E2s. Likewise, the putative E1-binding domain of the maize E2 is similar to all other E2s except for A. thaliana 2. The E1-binding domain for A. thaliana 1, however, is nearly identical to the same region from the maize E2 (Fig. 1, Table I). Like the lipoyl and E1-binding domains, the catalytic domain of the maize E2 is highly conserved but more similar to A. thaliana 1 than 2.Table IPercentage of amino acid identity and similarity between various eukaryotic dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferases and the maize 52-kDa homologueOrganismSubdomainInner lipoylE1 bindingCatalyticA. thalianaI87 (94)88 (100)77 (87)A. thaliana II63 (73)29 (49)45 (57)S. cerevisiae56 (72)61 (76)40 (53)Homo sapiens47 (68)49 (73)51 (61)A. thaliana plastid43 (55)44 (56)35 (44)S. cerevisiae E3-BP39 (55)27 (37)10 (21)Numbers refer to percentage of identity (percentage of similarity in parentheses) to the maize E2 described in this report.

For accession numbers see the legend to Fig. 1. Since the deduced amino acid sequence of the maize E2 is more related to a hypotheticalA. thaliana protein than the previously identified A. thaliana E2, we deemed it necessary to characterize this recombinant protein. The mature maize E2 starting at amino acid Ser108 was expressed in the protease-deficient E. coli strain BL21. The expression construct encoded for two additional residues (MV-) at the N terminus of the recombinant protein. When expressed in this manner, the maize E2 represented at least 30% of the total E. coli protein (Fig. 2). The maize E2 was 80–90% soluble under all conditions employed and was easily isolated by sonication in the presence of nonionic detergent. The native size of the recombinant E2 was noticeably large based on its ability to precipitate with ≥6% polyethylene glycol and the location of the protein peak upon density gradient centrifugation (30% glycerol, data not shown). The high molecular weight property of this recombinant protein facilitated its purification using a three-step procedure (TableII). Starting with 0.5 liter of culture broth, approximately 11 mg of purified protein were obtained with a 3-fold purification. The maize E2 was resistant to the few proteases inE. coli strain BL21 (lane 1, Fig. 2A). Furthermore, no internal initiation sites, resulting in truncated proteins, were observed by Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblotting with antibodies to the lipoyl or catalytic domains of plant E2s (data not shown). The purified E2 migrated primarily as a doublet at 52–53 kDa (Fig. 2A), considerably larger than the predicted mass of 46,934, which includes the N-terminal MV-. Monoclonal antibodies raised against the native maize E2 recognized the recombinant protein and decorated a third, faint band just above the doublet. The recombinant protein migrated at the same molecular weight as the native maize E2, which also appeared as a doublet with a third faint polypeptide above the primary species (Fig. 2, B and C).Table IIPurification scheme for recombinant maize dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase expressed in E. coli BL21FractionsTotalSpecific activityPurificationYieldProteinVolumeUnitsmgmlΔA232/minunits/mg−fold%Total16463.010,63064.81.00100Clarified lysate10161.0946093.71.45880–10% PEG27.02.539601472.2737Density gradient10.721.020401912.9519 Open table in a new tab Purified recombinant protein was functional based upon the high specific activity achieved with the nonisotopic detection of acetyldihydrolipoamide (Table II) and the rate observed with the transfer of [1-14C]acetate from [1-14C]acetyl-CoA to dihydrolipoamide (Fig. 3). The activity observed in the isotopic transfer assay was unequivocally the result of an enzymatic activity, because boiling the recombinant E2 prior to assaying abolished 98% of the activity. The purified recombinant E2 migrated as a distinct native species during Superose 6 chromatography. To obtain an estimate on the size of the recombinant protein, the standard curve had to be extrapolated, due to the lack of protein standards near the size of this complex. Based upon the standard curve in Fig. 4, the size of this protein was approximately 2.7 MDa. The recombinant protein from at least three different preparations was mostly associated with a sharp protein peak with some tailing (Fig. 4, inset). This elution profile is indicative of one predominant species. The protein peak eluted from Superose 6 was visualized by negative staining electron microcopy using phosphotungstate. Initially, a protein sample of 2.5 mg ml−1 was observed revealing numerous complexes. Dilution to 0.1–0.2 mg ml−1 allowed optimal visualization for measurements. The E2 complexes were homogeneous with respect to size (29 nm ± 2.1) and best seen at × 50,000–60,000 (Fig. 5). None of the protein complexes were cubic in shape, and most of them appeared “six-sided.” The E2 complexes from animals and yeast, which are both pentagonal dodecahedrons, gave this same appearance (14Wagenknecht T.

https://openalex.org/W2067580349,"This paper reports the identification of two structural variations in the NC1 domain of rat and mouse type XII collagen. The long NC1 domain encoding 74 amino acids showed homology to chicken type XII and XIV collagens. The short NC1 domain was composed of 19 amino acids. Through genomic DNA analyses, two alternative exons were identified, each of which contained the variable NC1 sequence. With the amino-terminal NC3 splicing alternatives, we propose here a new descriptive nomenclature: types XIIA-1 and XIIB-1 which include a long NC1 sequence encoded by exon 1 (from the 3′-end), and types XIIA-2 and XIIB-2 which include a short NC1 sequence encoded by exon 2. Types XIIA-1 and XIIB-1, the predominant transcripts in 15-day old mouse embryos, showed decreased expression in 17-day old embryos when type XIIB-2 expression was sustained at constant levels. In adult mice, type XIIB-1 associates with ligament and tendon, whereas type XIIB-2 is expressed in various other tissues. The long NC1 domain contains an extended acidic region (pI = 3.4) followed by a terminal basic region (pI = 13.8). Because the short NC1 domain lacks these features, structural variations in the type XII collagen NC1 domain suggests different functional roles in a tissue-specific fashion.

Because the short NC1 domain lacks these features, structural variations in the type XII collagen NC1 domain suggests different functional roles in a tissue-specific fashion. The primary structure of chicken and mouse type XII collagen has been determined from overlapping cDNAs and suggests that type XII collagen may interact in several ways with other matrix molecules (1Gordon M.K. Gerecke D.R. Olsen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6040-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 2Yamagata M. Yamada K.M. Yamada S.S. Shinomura T. Tanaka H. Nishida Y. Obara M.

For example, the amino-terminal region of type XII collagen forms three “finger-like” projections, the NC3 domains (see Fig. 1) (4Shaw L.M. Olsen B.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 191-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) which contain multiple repeats of fibronectin type III-like subunits, the domain A of von Willebrand factor, a region homologous to the NC4 domain of type IX collagen, as well as RGD sequences. Because of its adhesive structure, it has been proposed that this region of type XII collagen may play a role in the interactions between extracellular matrix molecules and cells, thus contributing to the physical state of the extracellular matrix (5Nishiyama T. McDonough A.M. Bruns R.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28193-28199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal region of type XII collagen contains triple-helical domains (COL1 and COL2) interrupted and flanked by non-triple-helical domains (NC1 and NC2) (Fig. 1). This structural feature is characteristic of a class of collagens, the FibrilAssociated Collagen withInterrupted Triple helices or FACIT 1The abbreviations used are: FACIT, Fibril Associated Collagen with Interrupted Triple helices; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s).

Biochem. 1995; 117: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fibril association through the carboxyl-terminal region has been postulated for members of the FACIT class of molecules. The details of such association with cartilage type II collagen fibrils have been characterized for type IX collagen (7Eyre D.R. Apon S. Wu J.-J. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 8van der Rest M. Mayne R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1615-1618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wu J.-J.

In type XII collagen, the “fibril association region” makes up less than 10% of the molecule and is thought to be integral to molecular interactions with type I collagen fibrils. However, although there is indirect evidence available to support such an interaction (5Nishiyama T. McDonough A.M. Bruns R.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28193-28199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Keene D.R. Lunstrum G.P. Morris N.P. Stoddard D.W. Burgeson R.E. J.

Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the details of type XII collagen “fibril association” have not yet been fully elucidated. One obstacle is the considerable difference in the NC1 domain structure of chicken and mouse type XII collagens. Chicken type XII collagen contains a long NC1 domain composed of 76 amino acids (1Gordon M.K. Gerecke D.R. Olsen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6040-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 2Yamagata M. Yamada K.M. Yamada S.S. Shinomura T. Tanaka H. Nishida Y. Obara M. Kimata K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), whereas mouse type XII collagen has only a 22-amino acid NC1 domain (3Bohme K. Li Y. Oh P.S. Olsen B.R. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 432-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to determine the structure of the carboxyl region of mammalian type XII collagen. In this report, we present evidence for two structural variations in the NC1 domain of type XII collagen that are generated by alternative splicing in a tissue-specific fashion. To obtain cDNAs encoding the COL2, NC2, COL1, and NC1 domains of rat and mouse type XII collagen, the 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was adapted (14Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990Google Scholar) using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from adult rat and mouse maxillary dento-alveolar tissues or total RNA from neonatal mouse skin. Site-directed coding and nested primers were designed based on the previously reported sequence of rat (15Karimbux N.Y. Rosenblum N.D. Nishimura I. J. Dent. Res. 1992; 71: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and mouse cDNAs (3Bohme K. Li Y. Oh P.S. Olsen B.R. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 432-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Primers 5′-GGT CCT CCA GGC CCT CAG GG-3′ and 5′-(CAU)4 CCA GGA GAA CCG GGT CGC CA-3′ were used to clone rat type XII collagen cDNAs. Primers 5′-TGG CAG TGC TGG AGC CAG AGG AG-3′, 5′-(CAU)4 TAT TGT GAT TCA TCC-3′, and 5′-(CUA)4TGA AAA ATG CCT CTT TTG-3′ were used to clone mouse type XII collagen cDNAs. PCR products were analyzed on Southern blots and cloned into the pAMP 1 vector (Cloneamp system, Life Technologies, Inc.) or the T vector (pT7 Blue vector, Novagen). The DNA sequences were determined by the chain-termination method (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Tail tissue from rats and mice were used to isolate genomic DNA samples. Two separate 3′-PCR primers (5′-CAA ACT GTA AGC AGC ACT-3′ and 5′-TGA AAA ATG CCT CTT TTG-3′) were designed to encode the reverse and complementary sequences of each of the different 3′-untranslated regions of type XII collagen cDNAs. Common 5′-primers were designed from the coding sequence of the COL1 and NC1 domains: 5′-TAT TGT GAT TCA TCC-3′ and 5′-ATT CAT CCC AGT GTG CCA GCA T-3′. Either a conventional PCR or long range PCR protocol (TaqPlus system, Stratagene) was used to amplify the α1(XII) collagen gene fragments, which were then confirmed by Southern blots. The initial experiments suggested that the exon involved in the short NC1 variant was located on the 5′-side of the exon involved in the long NC1 variant. To confirm this exon orientation, a separate PCR experiment was performed using a coding primer within the “short NC1” exon, 5′-GGT TCC GGC TAA CAA ACT-3′, and the anti-coding primer in the “long NC1” exon, 5′-GCA GCG ACT CTA TGT TCA TAG TCT TGC AAA-3′. These PCR products were cloned and sequenced to identify the exon-intron junctions. A multiple tissue RNA transfer blot with poly(A)+ RNA from whole mouse 7-, 11-, 15-, and 17-day old embryos was purchased from CLONTECH. Hybridization probes were generated from the subcloned fragments of exon 1 and exon 2, separately encoding “long NC1” and “short NC1” specific sequences. In some experiments, an antisense-rich linear amplification PCR was used to prepare the hybridization probes. As a positive control, cDNA of a 370-bp HindIII fragment (MRK) encoding the mouse type XII collagen NC3 domain was used (3Bohme K. Li Y. Oh P.S. Olsen B.R. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 432-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A mouse β-actin probe was used as a housekeeping gene control. Mouse clones SB#2 and SB#3, containing a 153-bp insert of the long NC-1 variant and a 102-bp insert of the short NC-1 variant, respectively, were used to synthesize riboprobes labeled with [α32P]UTP (MAXIscript, Ambion). The MRK clone containing a 370-bp insert of mouse type XII collagen NC3 domain sequence and mouse β-actin were used as a positive control and as a housekeeping gene control. The ribonuclease protection experiment was performed with 20 μg of total RNA from each of the following mouse tissues: sternal cartilage, dento-alveolar tissue, eye, skin, and tail; the protected bands were analyzed using a computerized program (Kodak Digital Science 1D). Two rat type XII collagen cDNAs were cloned: AK#M, a 1813-bp sequence (GenBankTMU57362); and AK#G, an 862-bp sequence (GenBankTMU57361). DNA sequencing revealed that both cDNAs encoded homologous DNA sequences for the COL2, NC2, and COL1 domains of α1(XII) collagen chains (TableI). However, the AK#M and AK#G clones contained striking sequence differences in the NC1 domain (74 and 19 aa, respectively) and in the 3′-untranslated regions (862 and 76 bp, respectively) (Table I and Fig. 2). When compared with the published chicken type XII collagen sequence, these rat clones showed highly conserved nucleotide sequences (COL2, 81%; NC2, 87%; and COL1, 79%) as well as amino acid sequence homology (COL2, 94%; NC2, 98%; and COL1, 93%).Table IThe fibril-associated region in chicken, rat, and mouse type XII collagensChickenaGordon et al.

Termination codons are indicated by ***.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The isolated mouse type XII collagen cDNA, ER#K (GenBankTMU57095), exhibited a sequence highly homologous to the rat AK#G clone with a short NC1 domain (19 aa; 100% homology) and a short 3′-untranslated region (63 bp long) (Table I and Fig. 2). Four of four mouse clones, which were amplified from the neonatal mouse skin total RNA sample, contained identical sequences, with the exception that the poly(A) tail varied from A19 to A60. The separately isolated mouse cDNA from the dento-alveolar tissue total RNA sample, SB#1, contained a long NC1 sequence (74 aa long) that was 93% homologous to the rat clone AK#M (Table I and Fig. 2). The data, based on these cDNAs, suggested the presence of alternative exons in the 3′-end of the α1(XII) gene. Rat and mouse genomic DNAs were examined by PCR analyses; two alternative exons were identified (Fig. 3). Exon 1 (from the 3′-end) encoded the variable sequence of the long NC1, whereas exon 2 (from the 3′-end) encoded the variable sequence of the short NC1. Both exons 1 and 2 contained separate translational termination codons (TAA and TGA, respectively) and separate 3′-untranslated regions. At the terminal end of exon 2, we detected the poly(A) signal consensus sequences—AATACT in the rat gene and AATACA in the mouse gene (Fig. 3). An exon-intron junction was detected at the beginning of each of the variable sequences. The split codon exon junction structure generates G AG (Glu) at the 17th amino acid residue of the long NC1 domain and G GT (Gly) at the 17th amino acid residue of the short NC1 domain (Figs. 2 and 3). Thus, an alternative splicing mechanism is strongly suggested to generate the long and short NC1 domains of type XII collagen. Exon 3 (from the 3′-end) encoded the common NC1 sequence and part of the COL1 domain. The intron sizes between exons 1 and 2 and between exons 2 and 3 were estimated at 1.4 and 1.1 kilobase pairs, respectively. DNA sequence analyses revealed that the previously reported mouse NC1 domain sequence (3Bohme K. Li Y. Oh P.S. Olsen B.R. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 432-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) matched the intron sequence immediately to the 3′-side of exon 3 (Fig. 3). Type XII collagen transcripts also contain separate alternative splicing variants, at the 5′-region of the α1(XII) gene, that generate the long and short NC3 domains, or type XIIA and XIIB, respectively. Poly(A)+ RNA from mouse embryos at days 15 and 17 showed the presence of both type XIIA (approximately 10 kb) and XIIB (approximately 7–8 kb) collagen mRNAs using MRK (mouse type XII collagen NC3 domain) as a probe. When a fragment of mouse genomic DNA containing the exon 1 sequence (long NC1) was used as a probe, both the 10- and 7–8-kb forms of type XII collagen mRNA were positively recognized. The expression pattern of long NC1 type XII collagen was similar to the pattern of the mRNA recognized by the MRK probe, which peaked in 15-day old mouse embryos and decreased in 17-day old embryos (Fig. 4). The exon 2 probe (short NC1) recognized primarily the 7–8-kb form of type XIIB collagen mRNA but only weakly hybridized with a 10-kb type XIIA collagen mRNA. The expression of short NC1 type XIIB collagen mRNA remained constant during the late stages (15- and 17-day old) of mouse embryo development (Fig. 4). The relative mRNA levels of type XII collagen varied among the different tissue specimens (cartilage, dento-alveolar tissue, eye, skin, and tail). The ribonuclease protection assays revealed an exceedingly high level of expression of type XII collagen with the long NC1 domain in dento-alveolar and tail tissue specimens compared with other mouse tissues and revealed moderate expression in cartilage (Fig. 5). Expression of type XII collagen with the short NC1 domain in the mouse was noticeably present in all tissues tested (Fig. 5). The newly discovered sequence variations in the NC1 domain of rat and mouse type XII collagen indicated the following characteristic substructures. At the amino-terminal end of the NC1 domain immediately adjacent to the COL1 domain, there is a “common region” that contains 16 amino acid residues, which are 100% conserved in rat and mouse NC1 variants (Fig. 6). The short NC1 domain found in the rat AK#G and mouse ER#K clones extends three additional amino acid residues from the common region prior to the termination codon. The short NC1 domain sequence, with a total of 19 amino acid residues, shows great similarity to the previously reported 22-amino acid mouse NC1 domain sequence deduced from cDNA mc102T (3Bohme K. Li Y. Oh P.S. Olsen B.R. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 432-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (Table I). However, based on the differences between the amino acid and nucleotide sequences at the carboxyl end of the coding region and the 3′-untranslated regions, the newly discovered short NC1 sequence should be considered distinct. These short NC1 sequences contain two conserved locations of cysteinyl residues, one at the end of the COL1 domain and the other at the fifth position in the NC1 domain. This structure is homologous to the corresponding domain of type IX collagen chains, which were recently shown to possess all the necessary information for chain selection and trimer assembly in vitro (17Mechling D.E. Gambee J.E. Morris N.P. Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Mayne R. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13781-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The long NC1 sequence of rat and mouse type XII collagen exhibited structural homology with chicken type XII collagen. Following the common region, a stretch of amino acids containing aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues forms the “acidic extension region” (Fig. 6), with a calculated pI of 3.4. The acidic extension region is further followed by a short polypeptide composed of nearly 40% basic amino acid residues, the “basic terminal region,” with a calculated pI of 13.8. These characteristic sub-structures of the long NC1 domain of type XII collagen seem to be shared with the corresponding domain of type XIV collagen. Type XII and XIV collagens belong to the FACIT family and show significant structural homology. However, histolocalization of these collagens appears to be somewhat different (18Lungstrum G.P.

In vitro experiments indicate that type XIV collagen appears to interact with a dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chain of decorin (22Font B. Aubert-Foucher E. Goldschmidt D. Eichenberger D. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25015-25018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the type XIV collagen NC1 domain contains a typical sulfated GAG binding sequence, it has been postulated that type XIV collagen interacts with type I collagen fibril through decorin. In contrast, the molecular interaction between type XII collagen, type I collagen, and proteoglycans is not yet fully understood (13Font B. Eichenberger D. Rosenberg L.M. van der Rest M. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The newly discovered NC1 domain isoforms may provide a long awaited clue toward elucidating the molecular interaction of type XII collagen. Our rat and mouse α1(XII) collagen genomic DNA sequence data further defined two alternative exons 1 and 2 that encode the long and short NC1 domain isoforms, respectively (Fig. 3). The previously reported NC1 domain sequence in mice (3Bohme K. Li Y. Oh P.S. Olsen B.R. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 432-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) did not match the NC1 domain sequences found in this study, rather it matched the sequence of the intron immediately following exon 3. RNA transfer blot analyses indicated that the poly(A)+ RNA sample isolated from 15- and 17-day old mouse embryos contained both type XIIA (10 kb) and type XIIB (7–8 kb) mRNAs that are due to alternative splicing in the NC3 domain (Fig. 1) (2Yamagata M.

Acta. 1992; 1171: 97-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It was noted that the exon 1 and exon 2 type XII collagen genomic DNA probes hybridized to the types XIIA and XIIB mRNAs to different degrees (Fig. 4). In light of the NC3 splicing alternatives (type XIIA and XIIB), we propose here a new descriptive nomenclature: 1) type XIIA-1, contains long NC3 domain and long NC1 domain; 2) type XIIA-2, contains long NC3 domain and short NC1 domain; 3) type XIIB-1, contains short NC3 domain and long NC1 domain; and 4) type XIIB-2, contains short NC3 domain and short NC1 domain. Types XIIA-1 and XIIB-1 include a long NC1 variable sequence encoded by exon 1 (from the 3′-end), and types XIIA-2 and XIIB-2 include a short NC1 variable sequence encoded by exon 2. These 5′-end (NC3) and 3′-end (NC1) alternative splicing mechanisms seem to be coordinately regulated during α1(XII) gene transcription. Type XIIA collagen (long NC3) is expressed primarily in embryonic tissues, whereas type XII collagen in adult tissues is predominantly the type XIIB species with the short NC3 domain. The ribonuclease protection assay examining adult mouse tissues further reveals that the type XII collagen long NC1 domain probe is protected in dento-alveolar tissue and tail tissue, which contain periodontal ligament and tail tendon, respectively. Because chicken type XII collagen derived from tendon is homologous to type XIIB-1, we speculate that the long NC1 domain may play a tissue-specific role essential to ligament/tendon extracellular matrix organization. In contrast, type XIIB-2 collagen with the short NC1 domain appears to be more widely expressed (Fig. 5). Sugrue et al. (25Sugrue S.P. Gordon M.K. Seyer J. Dublet B. van der Rest M. Olsen B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) reported that when monoclonal antibody 75d7 (generated against a synthetic peptide encoding a portion of the long NC1 domain of chicken type XII collagen) was used, the bone tissue including periosteum lacked any immunostaining. However, when another monospecific antibody (generated against a fusion peptide containing a nonvariant-region of the NC3 domain of mouse type XII collagen) was used, the entire periosteum of the long bone and membranous bones was stained (26Oh S.P. Griffith C.M. Hay E.D. Olsen B.R. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 196: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The implication of these previously published conflicting results is that newly defined type XIIB-2, which lacks the 75d7 epitope sequence in the long NC1 domain, may be predominantly present in periosteum. It is interesting to note that in nonligament/tendon tissues, type XII collagen localizes at the tissue interface zones such as the perichondreum of cartilage (18Lungstrum G.P. Morris N.P.

The short NC1 domain of type XII collagen may play a functional role at these tissue interface zones. The deduced sequence of the short NC1 domain contains a potential recipient site for O-serine-linked oligosaccharides at the carboxyl end. It is unknown, however, if this site is post-translationally modified. These results seem to suggest that the selection of the 3′-end alternative splicing is dependent on the tissue type and function. The newly discovered variations in the NC1 domain of type XII collagen can provide a clue as to the puzzling tissue distribution of type XII collagen in structurally and functionally diverse adult tissues. It is tempting to speculate that type XII collagen may contribute to different extracellular matrix organizations in these adult tissues, potentially through altering the fibril association schemes through its NC1 domain.

Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). Many human diseases such as long QT syndrome, Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome, episodic ataxia, and epilepsy are associated with mutations in these channels (2Wang Q. Curran M.E. Splawski I.

With an excellent repertoire of available genetic tools, Drosophila provides a powerful system for such studies. The existence of distinct behavioral phenotypes that arise due to defects in neuromuscular pathways has aided in identifying mutations that affect ion channels. A functional voltage-gated K+ channel consists of four α-subunits, each with six transmembrane domains (S1–S6) flanked by cytoplasmic amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions. A number of genes coding for K+ channel α-subunits have been cloned. These include genes from six families, defined by six DrosophilaK+ channel genes: Shaker (Kv1.1–1.7),Shab (Kv2.1–2.2), Shaw (Kv3.1–3.4),Shal (Kv4.1–4.3), ether-a-go-go (HERG) and slowpoke (maxiK) (7Salkoff L.

Expression of cRNAs of these genes results in the generation of K+ currents in Xenopus oocytes (18Wei A. Covarrubias M. Butler A. Baker K. Pak M. Salkoff L.

However, no mutations have been reported in any of these three genes, thus making it difficult to elucidate their in vivophysiological function. We describe the identification and molecular analysis of the first behavioral mutations that disrupt the Shab gene. These mutations were initially identified as causing a temperature-induced paralytic phenotype (20.Chopra, M., Ph.D. thesis, 1994, G. N. D. University, Amritsar, India.Google Scholar). 1M. Chopra, G.-G. Gu, and S. Singh, manuscript in preparation.. They selectively affect the delayed rectifier potassium current (IK), in larval body wall muscles, without affecting other K+ currents and reveal the in vivo functional role of the Shab gene inDrosophila. A mutation (z66) with the phenotype of temperature-induced paralysis had been earlier identified to specifically affect the delayed rectifier potassium current in larval muscles. 1The abbreviations used are: CS, Canton-S; OR, Oregon-R; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 30 male flies (3 days old) carrying theebony (e s) marker on chromosome 3 were mutagenized with 3500 rads of x-irradiation and mated in batches of three males and 10 z66 virgin female flies (3–5 days old). The males were removed from the vials after 3 days. F1 progeny from the cross were tested for temperature-induced paralysis at 39 °C for 5 min. Of the 5673 F1 progeny tested, one male fly (9g) paralyzed within 3 min at 39 °C and recovered from paralysis within 4 min of being transferred to room temperature (25 °C). The mutant was mated to virgin females carrying the third chromosome balancer TM3, Sb p p e s/TM6B, Tb Hu red e. F2 males and virgin females having ebony body color (with the TM3 balancer) were then mated to render the mutation homozygous. All stocks were maintained at 21 °C (21Chopra M. Singh S. J.

Singh S. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 32: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Ca2+-free recording solution contained 77.5 mm NaCl, 115 mm sucrose, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mmMgCl2, 5 mm Trehalose, 2.5 mmNaHCO3, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.1) (25Stewart B.A. Atwood H.L. Renger J.J.

Electrodes were pulled from thin walled 1.0-mm borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) and had resistances of about 10 megaohms. Voltage electrodes contained 2.5m KCl, and current electrodes contained a 3:1 mixture of 2.5 m KCl, 2 m potassium citrate (27Wu C.F. Haugland F.N. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 2626-2640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A Macintosh IISi computer provided the voltage clamp command pulses through a 12-bit digital-to-analog converter using the MacADIOS II/16 board (GW Instruments, Somerville, MA). Data were acquired after a 16-bit analog-to-digital conversion. Analysis was performed with a program written in Think-C (Symantec Corp., Cupertino, CA). Test currents were digitally sampled every 500 μs and digitally corrected for linear leakage with respect to currents obtained at −40 mV. Current densities (nanoamperes/nanofarads) were calculated as described previously (28Gielow M.L. Gu G.G. Singh S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6085-6093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kraliz D. Bhattacharya A. Singh S. J. Neurogenet. 1998; 12: 25-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out at 4 °C. Genomic DNA was extracted from CS and 9g flies (30Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Handbook. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The genomic DNA was digested withPstI restriction endonuclease, subjected to electrophoresis in an agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with probe prepared from the Shab cDNA. Probe was generated using the DIG High Prime DNA labeling and chemiluminescent detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Chemiluminescent detection was performed according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Total RNA was isolated from CS, Shab 1, Shab 2, and Shab 3 larvae and adult flies (1–2 days old) (30Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Handbook. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 5 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. PCR was performed using the UlTma DNA polymerase enzyme (Perkin-Elmer). RT-2 (5′-CGCCGAATTCCTCCTCGTCGCGCTGCCGCAGGGA-3′), RT-4 (5′-CGGATGCACGACATTTGTTTGCTTTCCTGTGTCGACAAT-3′), and RT-6 (5′-GGATGGGCAGT CCCTTGGCC-3′) were used for reverse transcription of RNA. Primers PCR-1 (5′-GAGGAAGCTTATGGTCGGGCAATTGCAAGGTGGACAGGCTGCTGG-3′) and RT-2 were used to amplify region 1 (base pairs 1–1231) of the cDNA templates (Fig. 3a). Primers PCR-3 (5′-GGAGGAATTCGGCGAAGGTAAATTCTCCGAGTACCA-3′) and RT-4 were used to amplify region 2 (base pairs 1215–2175) of the cDNA templates. Primers PCR-5 (5′- AATCAGATGCGCCGCGAAAAGGC-3′) and RT-6 were used to PCR amplify region 3 (base pairs 2000–2771) of the cDNA templates. PCR amplifications were performed as described by the manufacturer (Perkin-Elmer), using the hot start PCR technique. The PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation (93 °C, 2 min) followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 65 °C for 1.5 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. Amplified DNA was run on a 0.8% agarose gel and extracted by centrifugal filtration using Ultrafree-MC filter (Millipore Corp.). DNA was sequenced by the Roswell Park Biopolymer Sequencing Facility. Several ethylmethanesulfonate-induced mutations had been previously isolated in our laboratory by using the conditional phenotype of temperature-induced paralysis (20.Chopra, M., Ph.D. thesis, 1994, G. N. D. University, Amritsar, India.Google Scholar). These mutations were identified with the use of compound chromosomes (31Chovnick A. Ballantyne G.H. Baillie D.L. Holm D.G. Genetics. 1970; 66: 315-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Holm D.G. Ashburner M. Novitsky E. Genetics and Biology of Drosophila. 1b.

Genet. 1987; 208: 226-229Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Compound chromosomes have homologous copies of a chromosomal arm attached at the centromere. The use of compound chromosomes facilitates the isolation of mutants, because this allows heterozygous mutations to become homozygous during meiotic recombination. They enable identification of recessive autosomal mutations without setting up individual fly lines. Initial characterization showed that the delayed rectifier current,IK, was reduced in two of the temperature-sensitive paralytic mutants, z66 and z4 (Fig. 1a). Genetic analysis demonstrated that the mutations do not complement each other and therefore reside in the same gene. The effect of thez66 mutation on various other currents expressed in larval muscles has been examined. No significant change was seen in the fast transient voltage-activated K+ current,IA; the fast transient calcium-activated K+ current, ICF; the slow sustained calcium-activated K+ current, ICS; and the total Ca2+ current, thus suggesting that the mutation selectively affects IK(20.Chopra, M., Ph.D. thesis, 1994, G. N. D. University, Amritsar, India.Google Scholar).1 As shown in Table I,IK was reduced by 46.0 ± 3.0% inz66 mutants. The z4 mutants showed a 43.6 ± 3.4% reduction in IK.Table IEffect of mutations on IK in larval musclesGenotypeCurrent amplitudenReduction inIKReduction in Shab componentnA/nFaNanoamperes/nanofarads.%%CS16.5 ± 0.41000Shab 29.3 ± 0.4943.6 ± 3.471.2 ± 7.0Shab 18.9 ± 0.31246.0 ± 3.075.2 ± 6.6Shab 36.4 ± 0.21061.2 ± 2.7100Experiments were performed as in Fig. 1.

To determine the percentage reduction in the Shab component, reduction inIK from the 9g (Shab 3) null alleles was taken as representing 100% of the Shabcurrent. All values are given as mean ± S.E. To obtain additional alleles of the gene affected by the z66and z4 mutations, including some with chromosomal aberrations that would aid in identifying the gene affected by the mutations, we performed x-ray mutagenesis (35Brittnacher J.G. Ganetzky B. Genetics. 1983; 103: 659-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Male ebonyflies were subjected to x-ray mutagenesis and mated with virginz66 females (see “Experimental Procedures”). Screening of 5673 F1 progeny for temperature-induced paralysis at 39 °C led to the identification of a new mutant, 9g. In paralysis tests performed on 9g/z66 flies, the two mutations did not complement each other and hence are alleles of the same gene. As in z66, IK was affected in 9g mutants (Fig. 1a). There was a 61.2 ± 2.7% reduction of IK in9g homozygotes (see Table I). Recombination and deletion mapping localized the z66 and z4mutations to the left arm of chromosome 3 at 63A1-B6 (20.Chopra, M., Ph.D. thesis, 1994, G. N. D. University, Amritsar, India.Google Scholar).1 Deletion analysis of 9g showed that the mutation mapped to the same position. Shab, a K+ channel gene cloned by homology to Shaker lies on chromosome 3 at position 63A (17Butler A. Wei A.G. Baker K. Salkoff L. Science. 1989; 243: 943-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). By using deletions in this region (63A1-B9), Tsunoda and Salkoff (36Tsunoda S. Salkoff L. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5209-5221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that IK is reduced in embryonic neurons and myotubes of these deletion strains and suggested that Shab may code for a delayed rectifier potassium channel. To determine if the 9g mutation lies in the Shabgene, Southern blot analysis was performed on genomic DNA from wild type (CS) and 9g flies using the entire ShabcDNA as probe. CS was used in the analysis because the mutants were obtained from CS-derived strains. As shown in Fig. 2, a comparison between thePstI-digested CS and 9g DNA revealed a restriction fragment length polymorphism between mutant and wild type DNAs, indicating that the 9g mutation disrupts theShab gene. The 9g mutation and its two noncomplementing alleles, z66 and z4, contain the first mutations to be identified in the Shab gene. The mutant alleles in z66, z4, and 9g will be referred to hereafter as Shab 1,Shab 2, and Shab 3 respectively. To investigate the underlying molecular defects in the mutants, ShabcDNA was prepared by reverse transcription-PCR fromShab 1, Shab 2,Shab 3, and wild type (CS) flies (Fig. 3a). PCR products were sequenced, and results were compared with the published sequence ofShab derived from the OR strain (17Butler A. Wei A.G. Baker K. Salkoff L. Science. 1989; 243: 943-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Comparison of the sequences revealed that the CS sequence has an insertion of a single base (G) at position 2708 of the published OR sequence. This produces a shift in the reading frame, resulting in the addition of 60 amino acids at the C terminus of the Shab channel in CS. In addition to the insertion, we found other nucleotide changes, seven of which alter the encoded amino acid sequence. These changes from OR to CS are as follows (the number system is as previously defined for theShab (OR) gene; GenBankTM accession no. M32659): 1) a T to A transversion at nucleotide 92 that changes amino acid 31 from a leucine to a glutamine; 2 and 3) two G to A transitions at nucleotides 658 and 1084 that change amino acids 220 and 362 from glycine to serine; 4) a T to G transversion at nucleotide position 1483 that changes amino acid 495 from serine to alanine; 5) a C to G transversion at nucleotide 2481 that changes amino acid 827 from an aspartic acid to a glutamic acid; 6) a G to C transversion at nucleotide 2482 that changes amino acid 828 from a glutamic acid to a glutamine, and 7) a G to C transversion at nucleotide position 2630 that changes amino acid 877 from glycine to alanine. Butler et al. (17Butler A. Wei A.G. Baker K. Salkoff L. Science. 1989; 243: 943-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) reported the presence of a 90-nucleotide coding region (nucleotides 2151–2240) in the longest correctly splicedShab cDNA (Shab11) (GenBankTMaccession no. M32659) not found in other Shab cDNAs. In our experiments, the CS cDNA did not show the presence of these 90 nucleotides. The Shab gene sequence from CS has been entered in GenBankTM. Sequence comparison between CS and Shab 1 cDNAs revealed a single G to A transition at nucleotide position 1304, which changes an arginine at amino acid 435 to a glutamine (Fig. 3b). This arginine at position 435 is thought to be the last residue before the protein enters into the membrane as the first transmembrane segment (S1) (Fig. 4) and is an arginine or a lysine in most members of voltage-gated potassium channels (Fig. 5). In Shaker potassium channels, the NH2-terminal region and the S1 segment are essential for subunit interactions as well as expression of functional channels at the cell membrane (37Babila T. Moscucci A. Wang H. Weaver F.E. Koren G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 615-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 38Xu J. Yu W. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Li M. J. Biol.

The position of theShab 1 mutation is interesting and may suggest an important role for this region in the formation of a functionalShab channel.Figure 5Conservation of a positively charged amino acid immediately before S1. A sequence alignment of K+channels in the region of S1 shows conservation of basic residues (arginines and lysines) at the position immediately preceding the S1 transmembrane segment. The sequences are as follows: Shab,Drosophila melanogaster (Swiss-Prot P17970); Kv2.2 (CDRK),Rattus norvegicus (Swiss-Prot Q63099); Kv2.1 (DRK1),R. norvegicus (Swiss-Prot P15387); Kv1.5, Homo sapiens (Swiss-Prot P22460); Kv3.4, H. sapiens(Swiss-Prot Q03721); RCK1, R. norvegicus (Swiss-ProtP10499).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of the Shab 2 cDNA revealed a T to A transversion at nucleotide position 1823 (Fig. 3c). This missense mutation changes a valine to an aspartic acid at amino acid 608. This residue is found in the pore region of the ShabK+ channel (Fig. 4). The pore region consists of a turret, pore helix, and selectivity filter (40Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5769) Google Scholar). While the pore helix and the selectivity filter are highly conserved in their amino acid sequence, the turret, which lies at the external mouth of the pore, is less conserved. The amino acids in this region form high affinity binding sites for peptide inhibitors from scorpion venom (41MacKinnon R. Heginbotham L. Abramson T. Neuron. 1990; 5: 767-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The V608D mutation falls at the junction of the turret and the pore helix in the toxin binding site of the pore region. The sequences of Shab 1 and Shab 2, both of which were isolated in the same mutagenesis, corroborate the sequence of the CS Shab gene and provide evidence that the mutations observed are not due to polymorphic differences between the parent strain used for the isolation of the Shab 1and Shab 2 mutations and the original CS strain. Sequencing of reverse transcription-PCR products fromShab 3 RNA revealed two deletions. The first removed 24 base pairs from nucleotide positions 508–531. The second was a 356-base pair deletion from nucleotide positions 656–1011 (Fig. 3d), which caused a shift in the reading frame, creating a stop codon 74 bases downstream of the mutation. TheShab 3-encoded protein, as defined by conceptual translation of the cDNA, is therefore truncated prior to the S1 segment and lacks channel function (Fig. 4). Unless alternate splicing removes the region containing the second deletion,Shab 3 defines a functionally null mutation. To look for the existence of introns in the region of the deletions, we amplified and characterized Shab gene sequences from CS genomic DNA. Sequencing of the region from −55 to 1200 nucleotides showed no difference between wild-type genomic and cDNA sequences, indicating that there were no introns within this region. Thus, theShab 3 deletions are present within the first exon. We conclude that the Shab 3 protein lacks the entire transmembrane region and defines a null allele. The Shab, Shal, and Shawsubfamilies of voltage-gated K+ channels were identified on the basis of homology to Shaker (17Butler A. Wei A.G. Baker K. Salkoff L. Science. 1989; 243: 943-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Subsequently, channels belonging to these families have been cloned from a number of other species. However, the absence of in vivo mutations in any of the three genes has made it difficult to elucidate the physiological role and significance of these channels. Lack of mutations has also limited molecular analysis of the function and regulation of these channels. We have now identified viable behavioral mutations in theShab channels and have analyzed them at a molecular level. Our data show that the Shab gene codes for delayed rectifier K+ channels in larval body wall muscles. Three mutant alleles of the Shab gene have been characterized. Two alleles, Shab 1 and Shab 2, contain missense mutations. The third allele,Shab 3, contains two deletions in the cytoplasmic amino-terminal region of the protein and is a null allele (Fig. 4). It is significant that the delayed rectifier current,IK, is only reduced by 61.2 ± 2.7% and not completely abolished in Shab 3 (Fig. 1; Table I). If Shab channels carried all of theIK, then a null mutation in the Shabgene would be expected to lack delayed rectifier current. Thus, our results indicate that IK consists of more than one component, with a large fraction of the current being carried byShab channels. Detailed pharmacological and physiological studies performed on Shab 3 mutants support this hypothesis. 3Singh, A., and Singh, S. (1999) J. Neurosci., in press.Electrophysiological studies performed using genetic aberrations that delete a large region of chromosome containing the Shablocus in Drosophila show a 77% reduction ofIK in embryonic myotubes (36Tsunoda S. Salkoff L. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5209-5221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene that codes for the remaining current seen in the Shab 3mutants remains to be identified. One possible candidate is theShaw gene that codes for a noninactivating K+channel (18Wei A. Covarrubias M. Butler A. Baker K. Pak M. Salkoff L. Science. 1990; 248: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The availability of mutations that affect the residual current in the Shab 3 mutants will be helpful in studying this current and the gene coding for the channels. In Shab 1, an R435Q mutation exhibits a 46.0 ± 3.0% reduction in IK (Fig. 1). SinceShab channels carry 61.2% of the delayed rectifier current,Shab 1 mutants show a 75.2 ± 6.6% reduction in the Shab component of IK (Table I). The Shab 1 mutation changes a highly conserved arginine to a glutamine (R435Q) at the last amino acid before the protein enters the membrane as the first transmembrane segment (S1). Most transmembrane proteins contain signal/anchor sequences prior to the first transmembrane segments. These sequences include positively charged arginines or lysines, which are essential for determining membrane topology (42Beltzer J.P. Fiedler K. Fuhrer C. Geffen I. Handschin C. Wessels H.P. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 973-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Parks G.D. Lamb R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6119-6127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Substituting the arginines or lysines with neutral or negatively charged residues results in a significant fraction of membrane-spanning proteins anchoring in reverse topological orientation in the membrane (42Beltzer J.P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 19101-19109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Voltage-gated K+channels show similarly conserved arginines and lysines just before S1 (Fig. 5). It will be interesting to examine if the R435Q mutation inShab 1 results in a topological inversion. Mutations in the pore region affect various properties such as gating, channel activation, ion selectivity, and permeability (45Yool A.J. Schwarz T.L.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1200-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The V608D missense mutation in Shab 2 is in the pore region of the channel. This region is subdivided into the turret, pore helix, and selectivity filter (40Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5769) Google Scholar). The turret lies at the extracellular entryway of the pore and forms a high affinity binding site for various scorpion venom toxins such as charybdotoxin (41MacKinnon R. Heginbotham L. Abramson T. Neuron. 1990; 5: 767-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and agitoxin (48Gross A. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 399-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The amino acid composition in the turret is not highly conserved, but the overall structure of this region appears to be conserved (49MacKinnon R. Cohen S.L. Kuo A. Lee A. Chait B.T. Science. 1998; 280: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Using agitoxin footprinting on mutant Shaker channels, Gross and MacKinnon (48Gross A. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 399-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) determined the spatial location of amino acids in the pore entryway. According to their studies, Lys427 in Shaker channels, which corresponds to Val608 inShab channels, lies away from the center of the pore but makes direct contact with agitoxin. Mutating Lys427 to a negatively charged glutamic acid does not alter single channel conductance in Shaker channels when expressed in Xenopusoocytes (41MacKinnon R. Heginbotham L. Abramson T. Neuron. 1990; 5: 767-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, in Shab 2 mutants,IK is reduced in amplitude by 43.6 ± 3.4% (a 71.2 ± 7.0% reduction in the Shab-encodedIK). Further functional studies will have to be performed to understand the mechanism for the reduction ofIK in Shab 2. In vivo mutations have been used extensively to characterize genes and their protein products. Due to a large repertoire of genetic mutations and the ease of performing electrophysiological analysis, Drosophila has provided a very useful system for ion channel study. Two voltage-activated K+ currents (IA and IK) and two Ca2+-activated K+ currents (ICF and ICS) have been reported in the larval muscles ofDrosophila (27Wu C.F. Haugland F.N. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 2626-2640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Gho M. Mallart A. Pflugers Arch. 1986; 407: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 51Singh S. Wu C.F. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1325-1329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mutations that affectIA (Shaker) and ICF (slowpoke) have helped greatly in the analysis of these currents and their role in membrane excitability. Lack of mutations that specifically affect the delayed rectifier channels had made their genetic and functional identity difficult to elucidate. Availability of the Shab mutations that affectIK opens up many possibilities for studying this current and its role in larval muscle excitability.

We thank Maninder Chopra for identifying the Shab 1 and Shab 2 mutants and performing the initial characterization."
https://openalex.org/W2022149730,"We have investigated the basis for the striking difference between the broad DNA sequence selectivity of the c-Myb transcription factor minimal DNA-binding domain R2R3 in vitro and the more restricted preference of a R2R3VP16 protein for Myb-specific recognition elements (MREs) in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae transactivation system. We show that sequence discrimination in yeast is highly dependent on the expression level of Myb effector protein. Full-length c-Myb and a C-terminally truncated protein (residues 1–360) were also included in the study. All of the tested Myb proteins displayed very similar DNA binding properties in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Only minor differences between full-length c-Myb and truncated c-Myb(1–360) were observed. In transactivation studies in CV-1 cells, the MRE selectivity was highest at low expression levels of Myb effector proteins. However, the discrimination between MRE variants was rapidly lost with high input levels of effector plasmid. In c-Myb-expressing K-562 cells, the high degree of MRE selectivity was retained, thereby confirming the relevance of the results obtained in the yeast system. These data suggest that the MRE selectivity of c-Myb is an intrinsic property of only the R2R3 domain itself and that the transactivation response of a specific MRE in vivo may be highly dependent on the expression level of the Myb protein in the cell.

The c-Myb protein is a transcription factor encoded by the c-myb proto-oncogene (reviewed in Refs. 1Lüscher B. Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2235-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 2Ness S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: F123-F139Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 3Weston K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A short N terminus is followed by a highly conserved DNA-binding domain, a centrally located transactivation domain, and more C-terminally located negative regulatory domains. The DNA-binding domain is well characterized, comprising the three imperfect repeats, R1, R2, and R3. The R2 and R3 repeats alone are sufficient for sequence-specific DNA binding (4Gabrielsen O.S. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Science. 1991; 253: 1140-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This DNA-binding motif is highly conserved throughout evolution in both animal and plant kingdoms (5Rosinski J.A. Atchley W.R. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).A large body of evidence suggests strongly that c-Myb is involved in regulating cell growth and differentiation in hematopoietic cells. In chickens, retroviral v-Myb proteins p48v- myb(AMV-derived) and p135gag-myb-ets (E26-derived) both elicit myeloid leukemia. In mice, the majority of retroviral insertions in the c-myb gene result in N-terminal truncations of the c-Myb protein and deregulated expression, leading to myeloid leukemia (6Wolff L. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The abrogation of fetal liver hematopoiesis in mice with a c-myb null mutation confirmed a vital role for c-Myb in the development of hematopoietic cells (7Mucenski M.L. McLain K. Kier A.B.

A recent study showed that c-Myb is expressed in human primitive hematopoietic stem cells in the fetal aorta region, prior to colonization and definitive hematopoiesis in the fetal liver, confirming an important role for c-Myb in the development of hematopoietic cells (8Labastie M.C. Cortes F. Romeo P.H. Dulac C. Peault B. Blood. 1998; 92: 3624-3635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Much effort has been put into identifying relevant target genes for c-Myb action, and binding sites for c-Myb have been identified in an increasing number of gene promoters, including mim-1, neutrophile elastase (ELA2), cdc-2, c-myc,bcl-2, T cell receptor δ and γ chains, CD4, ADA, and lck (2Ness S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: F123-F139Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 6Wolff L. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, it has been difficult to establish a direct link between candidate genes, growth control, and oncogenic transformation (9Gonda T.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A notable exception is that of v-Myb being able to transactivate the GBX2 gene promoter and up-regulate transcription of the transcription factor GBX2. GBX2 in turn regulates transcription of the chicken growth factor cMGF, thereby creating an autocrine regulatory loop (10Kowenz-Leutz E. Herr P. Niss K. Leutz A. Cell. 1997; 91: 185-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Other promising candidate c-myb target genes, such as tom-1 (11Burk O. Worpenberg S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1371-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the adenosine 2B receptor (12Worpenberg S. Burk O. Klempnauer K.H. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), have been identified in differential screens, but promoter analysis data are not yet available.Several approaches have been used to define the consensus core DNA-binding site for c-Myb, YAACNG (Myb recognition element (MRE)). 1The abbreviations used are: MRE, Myb recognition element; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DBD, DNA-binding domain.1The abbreviations used are: MRE, Myb recognition element; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DBD, DNA-binding domain. The Myb consensus sequence was first deduced by isolation of chicken genomic DNA fragments bound by v-Myb on filters (13Biedenkapp H. Borgmeyer U. Sippel A.E. Klempnauer K.H. Nature. 1988; 335: 835-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) and from comparison of putative Myb binding sites within the SV40 enhancer (14Nakagoshi H. Nagase T. Kanei-Ishii C. Ueno Y. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3479-3483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction-based binding-site selection methods with Myb proteins resulted in minor extensions of the MRE consensus sequence (15Howe K.M. Watson R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3913-3919Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Weston K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3043-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis confirmed by NMR structural data has revealed that the Myb MRE is bipartite. The first half-site (YAAC) has the majority of specific contacts to R3, and the less well defined second half-site has mainly specific contacts with the R2subdomain (17Ording E. Kvavik W. Bostad A. Gabrielsen O.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Ogata K. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Sekikawa A. Inoue T. Kanai H. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y.

Sequence substitutions in the second half-site mainly affected the half-life of the protein-DNA complexin vitro (17Ording E. Kvavik W. Bostad A. Gabrielsen O.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A more detailed analysis of the second half-site revealed a flexible sequence requirement, possibly caused by a flexible structure in R2 (20Myrset A.H. Bostad A. Jamin N. Lirsac P.N. Toma F. Gabrielsen O.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4625-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 21McIntosh P.B. Frenkiel T.A. Wollborn U. McCormick Klempnauer K.-H. Feeney J.

In particular, base changes were readily accommodated in the highly conserved G6 position of the MRE, as long as a G was present in position 5. Bacterially expressed R2R3 protein bound the MRE variants TAACGG, TAACGT, and TAACTG with very similar binding affinities as measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). In contrast, these sequences conferred strikingly different transactivation activities (GG ≫ TG > GT and nonfunctional TT) in a strictly Myb DBD-dependent effector/reporter system, using a R2R3VP16 fusion protein and MRE β-galactosidase reporter plasmids inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (23Ording E. Bergholtz S. Brendeford E.M. Jamin N. Gabrielsen O.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1043-1051PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that optimal MRE sequences defined by in vitro binding studies may not directly reflect their importance and/or activity in vivo. The present study investigates in detail the basis for this in vivo/in vitro paradox. We have compared the MRE selectivity of recombinant R2R3 and R2R3VP16 in EMSAs and investigated the effect of Myb effector expression level on MRE preference in S. cerevisiae. The MRE selectivity of full-length and a C-terminally truncated Myb protein was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo in mammalian cells. We show that the MRE target sequence selectivity is an intrinsic property of the R2R3 domain, independent of other regions in the protein. However, more importantly, the apparent MRE target selectivity in vivo is highly affected by the Myb protein expression level both in yeast and in mammalian cells.DISCUSSIONWe have investigated the basis for the paradox between the broad MRE sequence selectivity of c-Myb R2R3 in vitro and the highly restricted preference of R2R3VP16 protein for MRE target sequence in a S. cerevisiae transactivation system (23Ording E. Bergholtz S. Brendeford E.M. Jamin N. Gabrielsen O.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1043-1051PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that this striking difference could not be attributed to fusion of the VP16 transactivation domain to R2R3 used in the in vivo studies. We found only subtle differences in the MRE preference of R2R3VP16 compared with recombinant R2R3 in vitro, implying that the addition of the VP16 transactivation domain did not functionally affect the neighboring DBD. We also investigated the DNA binding properties of longer c-Myb proteins, and found that the in vitro MRE selectivity of c-Myb(FL) and C-terminally truncated c-Myb(1–360) was very similar to that of both R2R3VP16 and R2R3. In general, only minor differences were found between the in vitro DNA binding properties of c-Myb(FL) and C-terminally truncated c-Myb(1–360) proteins. However, we observed that c-Myb(FL) consistently bound slightly less well to the TG oligo (MBS-I-like) than the GG oligo (mim-1 A-like), compared with the other expressed Myb proteins. This difference was also reflected in the transactivation data, where a MRE TG variant reporter plasmid was transactivated more poorly than a MRE GG variant (see below).Several studies have reported that a C-terminal truncation of c-Myb resulted in an increase in the DNA binding activity (34Ramsay R.G. Ishii S. Gonda T.J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1875-1879PubMed Google Scholar, 35Tanaka Y. Nomura T. Ishii S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 38Ramsay R.G. Ishii S. Gonda T.J. J. Biol Chem. 1992; 267: 5656-5662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this increased DNA binding also could contribute to the transforming phenotype of v-Myb (34Ramsay R.G. Ishii S. Gonda T.J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1875-1879PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have demonstrated that truncation of the C-terminal tail did not increase the DNA binding capacity of c-Myb tested in EMSAs on themim-1 A binding site (GG-type) (24Oelgeschlager M. Krieg J. Luscher-Firzlaff J.M. Luscher B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5966-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 36Krieg J. Oelgeschlager M. Janknecht R. Luscher B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2221-2228PubMed Google Scholar), an MRE sequence motif derived from λ DNA (TG-type) (41Howe K.M. Reakes C.F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), or a mim-1A-related sequence motif (GG-type) in the c-myc promoter (42Zobel A. Kalkbrenner F. Guehmann S. Nawrath M. Vorbrueggen G. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1397-1407PubMed Google Scholar). Our data with c-Myb proteins expressed in mammalian cells agree with the latter studies in that there is no major difference in the DNA binding activity between full-length and C-terminally truncated c-Myb. However, we do find subtle differences that are dependent on the MRE target site. Taken together, our results suggest that the ability to discriminate between MRE sequences is an intrinsic property of the c-Myb DNA-binding domain only, independent of other domains in the c-Myb protein.A clue to resolution of the in vitro/in vivo DNA target specificity paradox was the observation that in the yeast system, the strong MRE sequence selectivity in vivo was highly dependent on the physiological expression level of Myb effector protein. The ability of c-Myb proteins to transactivate selected MRE target sites in mammalian cells was also found to be strongly dependent on the expression level of c-Myb effector protein, both in a effector/reporter system (CV-1) and in an intrinsic c-Myb-expressing cell line (K-562). At a low input of Myb effector in CV-1 cells and in c-Myb+ K-562 cells, transactivation of MRE reporter plasmids was dependent on the position 5 and 6 nucleotides (see TableI) in the order GG > GT ∼ TG, in accordance with results from the yeast system, with the c-Myb effector being expressed at a physiological level. At high expression levels of Myb effector proteins, this discrimination between MRE sequences was lost, both in mammalian cells and in the S. cerevisiae system. At very high input levels of c-Myb proteins in CV-1 cells, the 3xTT MRE reporter plasmid was transactivated to a high level, even though this MRE was not bound by Myb proteins in EMSAs. This effect was particularly prominent for full-length c-Myb. Our findings suggest that activation of target genes by c-Myb may greatly depend on the expression level of Myb proteins in the cell, a notion also suggested by others (38Ramsay R.G. Ishii S. Gonda T.J. J. Biol Chem. 1992; 267: 5656-5662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).It has been difficult to define bona fide target genes for c-Mybin vivo. Several in vitro methods have therefore been employed to predict MRE target sequences. An important question is whether these in vitro methods are able to accurately predict in vivo Myb target sites. Several in vitro studies have demonstrated that the minimal Myb DNA-binding domain R2R3 is able to accommodate a number of changes in the DNA MRE second half-site (14Nakagoshi H. Nagase T. Kanei-Ishii C. Ueno Y. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3479-3483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Howe K.M. Watson R.J.

Watson R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3913-3919Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) or YAACKGHH (16Weston K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3043-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In these studies, the (T/C)AACGG sequence was prevalent in selected single MRE-site oligos, 70% (15Howe K.M. Watson R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3913-3919Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and 38–70% (16Weston K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3043-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), depending on the Myb protein used. Efforts have also been made at thermodynamic measurements (43Oda M. Furukawa K. Ogata K. Sarai A. Nakamura H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and free energy matrixes (44Deng Q.L. Ishii S. Sarai A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 766-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) as aids in predicting MRE sites in vitro. However, these methods were based only on the MBS-I (TG-like) version of the MRE, which we find a suboptimal Myb binding site in vivo. In well characterized Myb target gene promoters (TableII), Myb binding sites with a G in both positions 5 and 6 is also strongly represented. In our study, the bona fide Myb MRE site TAACGG from the mim-1 promoter (27Ness S.A. Marknell A. Graf T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) was highly preferred in transactivation assays compared with the MBS-I-like sequence TAACTG, both in yeast and in mammalian cells with moderate expression of Myb effector protein. Taken together, there is good correlation between Myb MRE sites in Myb target genes and the preferred MRE sites in both mammalian cells (low effector input level) and in our model in vivo transactivation system in S. cerevisiae.Table IIDefined Myb recognition elements in gene promotersMRE consensus1234 YAAC5678NG9aBase positions in the MRE consensus sequence are numbered 1 to 9.Ref.mim-1AgcattaTAACGGtt ttttagcgc2Ness S.A.

Open table in a new tab A general problem in the analysis of gene promoters is that putative transcription factor binding sites are present at a much higher frequencies than the expected number of the target genes for that particular transcription factor. This paradox is partially resolved by the concerted action of several transcription factors supplying the specificity of the particular gene promoter activity. Another possibility, illustrated in this study, is that the activity of transcription factor binding sites may be more stringent in vivo than suggested by in vitro analysis methods. A general weakness of transient transfection studies in mammalian cells is the lack of control of the test gene expression level on a per cell basis, and conditions may easily become nonphysiological, as demonstrated in this study.Our model transactivation system in S. cerevisiae has several promising features. First, our data demonstrate that c-Myb R2R3VP16 fusion protein expressed in yeast has DNA binding properties very similar to full-length c-Myb and is able to mimic the MRE sequence selectivity of full-length mammalian c-Myb in the yeast effector/reporter system. The R2R3VP16 fusion protein should therefore be a suitable model protein for measuring the DNA binding activity of c-Myb on putative Myb target DNA sequences independently of other domains in the c-Myb protein. Second, the system exploits features of yeast plasmids such as control of copy number (gene dosage), the use of metabolic markers to ensure the presence of effector and reporter plasmids in a homogenous yeast population (in contrast to cell-line-dependent variations and wide range of transfection efficiencies in mammalian cells), and the plasmids being in a physiological chromatin-packaged state (45Morse R.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In summary, the advantage of the yeast system is that the expression level of the effector protein (transcription factor) is well controlled, thus avoiding overexpression and misleading transactivation of suboptimal target DNA-binding sites, as demonstrated in this study. Our yeast effector/reporter system may easily be applied as an in vivotool for evaluating putative DNA-binding sites for other monomeric transcription factors. The c-Myb protein is a transcription factor encoded by the c-myb proto-oncogene (reviewed in Refs. 1Lüscher B. Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2235-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 2Ness S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: F123-F139Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 3Weston K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A short N terminus is followed by a highly conserved DNA-binding domain, a centrally located transactivation domain, and more C-terminally located negative regulatory domains. The DNA-binding domain is well characterized, comprising the three imperfect repeats, R1, R2, and R3. The R2 and R3 repeats alone are sufficient for sequence-specific DNA binding (4Gabrielsen O.S. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Science. 1991; 253: 1140-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This DNA-binding motif is highly conserved throughout evolution in both animal and plant kingdoms (5Rosinski J.A. Atchley W.R. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence suggests strongly that c-Myb is involved in regulating cell growth and differentiation in hematopoietic cells. In chickens, retroviral v-Myb proteins p48v- myb(AMV-derived) and p135gag-myb-ets (E26-derived) both elicit myeloid leukemia. In mice, the majority of retroviral insertions in the c-myb gene result in N-terminal truncations of the c-Myb protein and deregulated expression, leading to myeloid leukemia (6Wolff L. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The abrogation of fetal liver hematopoiesis in mice with a c-myb null mutation confirmed a vital role for c-Myb in the development of hematopoietic cells (7Mucenski M.L. McLain K. Kier A.B. Swerdlow S.H. Schreiner C.M. Miller T.A. Pietryga D.W. Scott Jr., W.J. Potter S.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 677-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that c-Myb is expressed in human primitive hematopoietic stem cells in the fetal aorta region, prior to colonization and definitive hematopoiesis in the fetal liver, confirming an important role for c-Myb in the development of hematopoietic cells (8Labastie M.C. Cortes F. Romeo P.H. Dulac C. Peault B. Blood. 1998; 92: 3624-3635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Much effort has been put into identifying relevant target genes for c-Myb action, and binding sites for c-Myb have been identified in an increasing number of gene promoters, including mim-1, neutrophile elastase (ELA2), cdc-2, c-myc,bcl-2, T cell receptor δ and γ chains, CD4, ADA, and lck (2Ness S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: F123-F139Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 6Wolff L. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, it has been difficult to establish a direct link between candidate genes, growth control, and oncogenic transformation (9Gonda T.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A notable exception is that of v-Myb being able to transactivate the GBX2 gene promoter and up-regulate transcription of the transcription factor GBX2. GBX2 in turn regulates transcription of the chicken growth factor cMGF, thereby creating an autocrine regulatory loop (10Kowenz-Leutz E. Herr P. Niss K. Leutz A. Cell. 1997; 91: 185-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Other promising candidate c-myb target genes, such as tom-1 (11Burk O. Worpenberg S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1371-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the adenosine 2B receptor (12Worpenberg S. Burk O. Klempnauer K.H. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), have been identified in differential screens, but promoter analysis data are not yet available. Several approaches have been used to define the consensus core DNA-binding site for c-Myb, YAACNG (Myb recognition element (MRE)). 1The abbreviations used are: MRE, Myb recognition element; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DBD, DNA-binding domain.1The abbreviations used are: MRE, Myb recognition element; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DBD, DNA-binding domain. The Myb consensus sequence was first deduced by isolation of chicken genomic DNA fragments bound by v-Myb on filters (13Biedenkapp H. Borgmeyer U. Sippel A.E. Klempnauer K.H. Nature. 1988; 335: 835-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) and from comparison of putative Myb binding sites within the SV40 enhancer (14Nakagoshi H. Nagase T. Kanei-Ishii C. Ueno Y. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3479-3483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction-based binding-site selection methods with Myb proteins resulted in minor extensions of the MRE consensus sequence (15Howe K.M. Watson R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3913-3919Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Weston K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3043-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis confirmed by NMR structural data has revealed that the Myb MRE is bipartite. The first half-site (YAAC) has the majority of specific contacts to R3, and the less well defined second half-site has mainly specific contacts with the R2subdomain (17Ording E. Kvavik"

Triplex-mediated psoralen modification of the mutant T residue was sought as an approach to gene repair. The 24-nucleotide purine-rich target sequence switches from one strand to the other and has four pyrimidine interruptions. Therefore, a third strand sequence favorable to two triplex motifs was used, one parallel and the other antiparallel to it. To cope with the pyrimidine interruptions, which weaken third strand binding, 5-methylcytosine and 5-propynyluracil were used in the third strand. Further, a six residue “hook” complementary to an overhang of a linear duplex target was added to the 5′-end of the third strand via a T4 linker. In binding to the overhang by Watson-Crick pairing, the hook facilitates triplex formation. This third strand also binds specifically to the target within a supercoiled plasmid. The psoralen moiety at the 3′-end of the third strand forms photoadducts to the targeted T with high efficiency. Such monoadducts are known to preferentially trigger reversion of the mutation by DNA repair enzymes.

Nucleic acid third strand binding provides an effective and specific means of directing reagents to unique sites in a complex duplex genome (1Broitman S.L. Im D.D. Fresco J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

When the reagent linked to the third strand allows covalent attachment to a mutated base pair, the resultant adduct may be recognized as a defect to be corrected by some DNA repair mechanism. Error-prone repair in such a situation can lead to correction of the mutation. This approach has been utilized to effect specific base pair changes following psoralen photoadduct formation site-directed by specific sequence third strands (5Havre P.A. Gunther E.J. Gasparro F.P. Glazer P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7879-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 6Wang G. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M.

In particular, the use of irradiation times and wavelength favorable for monoadduct formation has been shown to induce the transversion T·A → A·T (5Havre P.A. Gunther E.J. Gasparro F.P. Glazer P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7879-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To make such a third strand-mediated strategy for site-specific base pair change viable, it is necessary to overcome two primary barriers. One stems from the fact that ideal sites for spontaneous third strand binding, i.e. perfect homopurine·homopyrimidine target sequences 15–25 base-pairs long occur with limited frequency. The second barrier is that in the face of imperfect targets, third strand binding energy is often insufficient to permit stable triplex formation. We have exploited the triplex-based approach to develop a strategy for correcting the mutation that underlies human sickle cell anemia, which is due to an A·T → T·A transversion in the gene for the β-globin chain located on chromosome 11 (9Moschonas N. de Boer E. Flavell R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 2109-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).

These encumbrances make it a difficult target for third strand binding, requiring a strand-switching “cross-over” strategy (10Jayasena S. Johnston B.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the use of modified third strand residues and, when this target is contained in a linear duplex fragment, a duplex-forming hook (Fig. 1b) to provide sufficient third strand binding energy to enable triplex-mediated psoralen photoaddition in high yield precisely at the mutant base pair. These were synthesized by automated phosphoramidite chemistry, purified to homogeneity by denaturing PAGE, and recovered from gel slices via the “modified crush-and soak” method (11Chen Z. Ruffner D.E. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 820-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Final purification was by acetonitrile/water (50/50) elution from C18 Sep-Pak reverse phase columns (Millipore), followed by spin evaporation to dryness. Oligomer concentrations were adjusted spectrophotometrically in Milli-Q-purified water. Psoralen was attached to the 3′-end of designated oligomers by incorporating the phosphoramidite of psoralen CPG (containing a C-16 linker between psoralen C-3 and DMT) (Chemgenes Corp., Waltham, Massachusets) during oligomer synthesis. Oligomer homogeneity was ascertained by32P-5′-end-labeling and denaturing PAGE. Oligomers were32P-5′-end-labeled preparatively by incubating approximately 4 pmol of oligomer with 2 mCi [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 1 unit of T-4 polynucleotide kinase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) at 37 °C for 1 h, purified by denaturing PAGE, and eluted from C18 Sep-Pak columns. All experiments, unless otherwise noted, were performed in 0.1 m NaOAc, pH 5.0, 0.01 mMg(OAc)2 (standard buffer). Duplexes were formed by mixing equimolar amounts of each strand, heating to 80 °C and slowly annealing to room temperature in the standard buffer. Various ratios of third strand were added to pre-formed duplex, and resulting mixtures were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and then at 4 °C overnight. Denaturing PAGE was performed on slabs 25 × 45-cm using 8 m urea, TBE, 16% polyacrylamide gels (1:37 bisacrylamide/acrylamide). Samples were dissolved in denaturing loading buffer (12Maniatis T.

Denaturing gels were run for 2–6 h at 1.5 kV at room temperature. Nondenaturing PAGE was conducted on a 20 × 20-cm slab of 15% polyacrylamide in the standard buffer (see above) and run at 4 °C for 12 h at 150 V. Denaturing gels were soaked in standard fixing solution (12Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar), then in 100% methanol to remove water (13Thomas M. Abedi H. Farzaneh F. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 533PubMed Google Scholar), and dried onto Whatman filter paper on a Bio-Rad gel dryer. Gels were visualized using either or both NEN Life Science Products x-ray film and an ImageQuest PhosphorImager, which was also used to quantitate gel bands. Triplexes with 32P on the 5′-end of the D-2 strand (0.5 μm duplex) were mixed with 0.6 units of DNase I (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) in a final volume of 8 μl and incubated at 8 °C in the standard buffer. At designated times, 2 μl aliquots were removed to 2 μl of denaturing gel-loading buffer, frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath, and analyzed by denaturing PAGE. After fixing and drying on filter paper, gels were imaged and quantitated. Band assignments of DNase I digests were determined from sequencing ladders (see below) run in lanes adjacent to lanes with DNase I-treated samples. Triplexes in 10-μl droplets in appropriate buffer were placed on a parafilm-covered glass plate lying on ice and positioned 10 cm under a UV light source (“Blac Ray”, 15 mW/cm2 at 365 nm). Thermocouple readings showed that sample temperature was maintained at ∼8 °C. During irradiation, the ice container was placed on a rotating turntable to ensure even exposure of all samples to UV light. At indicated times, 2-μl aliquots were added to 2 μl of denaturing gel-loading buffer, and after mixing and heating to 80 °C were analyzed by denaturing PAGE. UV-irradiated complexes were fractionated by denaturing PAGE. After extraction from gel slices, photoproducts were purified on C-18 columns, and utilized as templates for primer extension by Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Gel-purified 32P-5′-end-labeled 8-nt primers complementary to the 3′-end of D-1 were annealed to the template by heating to 80 °C and slowly cooling to 8 °C. Primer extension reactions were carried out according to Sequenase 2.0 kit instructions (14Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA Sequencing Kit. 9th Edition. Amersham Life Science, Inc., 1994Google Scholar), and reaction products were analyzed by denaturing PAGE. Gels were fixed, dried, and analyzed by autoradiography and phosphorimaging. A plasmid pSCe was constructed by inserting a 610-base pair sickle cell β-globin gene fragment surrounding the mutation site into the pBluescript vector (Stratagene).32P-end-labeled PsT-2 and PsT-3 were incubated at 20 °C for 1 h with 10−8m pSCe and/or pBluescript (vector without the insert) at a 10:1 molar ratio in the standard buffer and then at 4 °C overnight prior to irradiation. Irradiated plasmids were electrophoresed on agarose gel in TBE under conditions where nonphotoattached third strand dissociates from the target, and the gels were evaluated by ethidium bromide staining, autoradiography, and phosphorimaging. Fig. 1,a and b, show the 38- and 35-base pair linear target fragments, DL-1·DL-2 and D-1·D-2, respectively, of the β-globin gene sequence of human chromosome 11 used in this investigation. D-1·D-2 is a version of DL-1·DL-2 shortened at the downstream end. Residue T11 on strand DL-1/D-1 (shown in bold) is the consequence of the A → T transversion responsible for sickle cell anemia. Residues 1–17 on strand D-2 (4–21 on DL-2) and 12–19 on D-1/DL-1 comprise the 24-nt purine-rich third strand binding region that was targeted for triplex formation. The one T and three C residues within the purine-rich sequence of the D-2 binding domain significantly decrease the effectiveness of third strand binding to the target. Our original approach was a strand-switching third strand with an acridine intercalator added at the 5′-end (Fig. 1a). The triplex forming domain of PsT-1 was designed to bind to the DL-2 target segment in the pyrimidine/parallel motif, and then cross over to bind to the DL-1 segment in the GT/antiparallel motif. This design allows the psoralen moiety at the 3′-end of PsT-1 to be positioned directly opposite the mutant T11 residue of DL-1. To enhance the association to this target, pr5U 2O. Amosova and J. R. Fresco, unpublished. was positioned opposite the three C·G inversions, G opposite the T·A inversion (15Yoon K. Hobbs C.A. Koch J. Sardaro M. Kutny R. Weis A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3840-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16Fossella J.A. Kim Y.J. Shih H. Richards E.G. Fresco J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4511-4515Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and me5C was substituted for C in the third strand opposite G·C pairs (17Posvic T.J. Dervan P.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 3059-3061Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Despite these various modifications, binding was not sufficiently enhanced (see below). The strategy ultimately employed to achieve more effective third strand binding to the target in a linear duplex fragment is depicted in Fig. 1b. Additional binding energy was designed into the system by truncating the 3′-end of the DL-1 target strand (resulting in the D-1 strand) to produce a 6-nt single-stranded “sticky” 5′-end of D-2. The 5′-end of PsT-1 (third strand) was then elongated in complementary fashion (via a linker of four T residues) to produce a duplex-forming hook to bind to the D-2 sticky end (Fig. 1b), resulting in third strand PsT-2. The combined strategy of using stronger binding modified residues, crossing-over of the third strand, and a duplex-forming hook proved successful in forming the structure in Fig. 1b. PsT-3, a scrambled sequence containing the 5′-duplex binding hook and 3′-psoralen, was used as a negative control (Fig. 1c). Band-shift assays at 4 °C evaluated by native PAGE were used to assess third strand binding. Fig. 2 shows that both PsT-2 and PsT-3 induce a band-shift of 32P-labeled target duplex D-1·D-2, whereas PsT-1, the hookless third strand, does not with DL-1·DL-2. This indicates that the binding energy between the sticky end of D-2 and the 6-nt hook of either PsT-2 or PsT-3 is sufficient to form a stable complex with apparent triplex stoichiometry under the electrophoretic conditions, whereas that between the triplex-forming domain alone and the duplex target is not. However, the results with PsT-2 and PsT-3 do not discriminate between true triplexes and complexes in which the third strand is merely bound by the hook. Note also that the mobility of the PsT-3-containing complex is somewhat lower, which may be a consequence of the “dangling” third strand making the complex much less compact than a (presumably) true triplex formed by PsT-2. Furthermore, electrophoretic analysis at 25 °C shows no band-shift for PsT-3, whereas PsT-2 does form a complex (data not shown). This is consistent with melting by that temperature of the hook from the complex that is not a triplex. DNase I protection experiments (18Galas D.J. Shmitz A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 55: 3157-3170Crossref Scopus (1324) Google Scholar) were performed to discriminate between triplexes, which should be relatively protected, and complexes formed merely by the third strand hook, which should be sensitive to the enzyme. Fig. 3a shows the results of denaturing PAGE analysis of such digests. Complexes formed with 10:1 (0.5 μm duplex, 5 μm PsT-2) and 100:1 (0.5 μm duplex, 50 μm PsT-2, data not shown) ratios of PsT-2:duplex display reduced sensitivity to DNase I along D-2 target segments B and C, but not along the unprotected segment A (cf. Fig. 1a). In contrast, complexes formed with similar ratios of the negative control strand PsT-3 do not display reduced DNase I sensitivity along any segment of D-2. The gel from Fig. 3a was quantitated, and the photodensity of each D-2 segment was determined. These results, expressed in TableI as the fraction of the total strand cuts within each D-2 segment, confirm that complexes formed with PsT-2 display much reduced DNase I sensitivity along the D-2 target segments B and C, but not at unprotected segment A. This protection is very strong for segment C, but less evident for segment B (Table I), which contains the strand-switching triplex domain. Further, in Fig. 3b, where DNase I sensitivity is shown relative to that of naked duplex, the data clearly indicate protection along the D-2 target segment in the presence of PsT-2, but a lack of protection in the presence of PsT-3. Thus, triplex formation occurs only with PsT-2; so PsT-3 must be bound to duplex only by the hook.Table IQuantitative analysis of DNase I protection resultsStructureSegmentABCB + CDuplex 0.5 μm22.240.537.377.8+ PsT-2, 0.5 μm34.237.128.765.8+ PsT-2, 5 μm55.629.115.344.4+ PsT-2, 50 μm49.129.821.150.9+ PsT-3, 5 μm24.635.638.875.4+ PsT-3, 50 μm24.232.443.475.8PAGE results were used to obtain the indicated percentages, which represent the fraction of total strand cuts localized along each designated D-2 segment after 3 min of DNase I treatment. Segment A, unprotected nontarget segment; segments B and C, protected triplex target segments (see Fig. 1). Note that the nuclease sensitivity profile in the presence of PsT-3 is similar to that for unprotected naked duplex, whereas in the presence of PsT-2, nuclease sensitivity is shifted from the 5′-end of D-2 to its unprotected 3′-end. Open table in a new tab PAGE results were used to obtain the indicated percentages, which represent the fraction of total strand cuts localized along each designated D-2 segment after 3 min of DNase I treatment.

The complexes formed with PsT-1, PsT-2, and PsT-3 were UV-irradiated and the products analyzed by denaturing PAGE. Based upon the expected triplex structure, a psoralen on the 3′-end of PsT-1 or PsT-2 should principally form monoadducts (19Gasparro F.P. Havre P.A. Olack G.A. Gunther E.J. Glazer P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2845-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) to residue T11 on the D-1/DL-1 strand, resulting in covalent attachment of the third strand. The long length of the linker (C16) between the psoralen moiety and the third strand makes possible additional monoadducts to T9 of D-1/DL-1 and to various pyrimidine residues along D-2/DL-2, the complementary duplex strand. Interstrand psoralen crosslinks (19Gasparro F.P. Havre P.A. Olack G.A. Gunther E.J. Glazer P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2845-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) are also possible between pyrimidine residues of D-1/DL-1 and D-2/DL-2. Fig. 4 shows denaturing PAGE analysis of UV-irradiated complexes containing 32P-end-label on the D-1 or DL-1 strand that contained either 100 nm or 40 μm of the appropriate third strand. Photoproducts are observed in the presence of PsT-2, and also in the presence of the hookless PsT-1 at 40 μm; neither duplex alone nor any complex of PsT-3 and duplex produce higher molecular weight bands, notwithstanding the psoralen moiety tethered to the 3′-end of PsT-3 (Fig. 4). Third strand binding affinity of PsT-1 and PsT-2 was evaluated by the dependence of photoproduct formation on third strand concentration. Varying concentrations of third strand were annealed to target duplex, irradiated, and analyzed by denaturing PAGE analysis (Fig. 5a). Bands were quantitated (Fig. 5b), giving apparent Kd values of <3 nm for PsT-2 and ∼3,000 nm for PsT-1. The 1,000-fold difference in Kd values between PsT-1 and PsT-2 clearly demonstrates the advantage of the third strand with the duplex-forming hook, and all further work was performed using PsT-2. To investigate the interaction of psoralen-linked third strand with the coding and noncoding target strands, irradiation experiments were performed using duplex with either 32P-D-1 or 32P-D-2. Triplexes with D-1 labeled show a major photoproduct and two minor ones, one slightly faster moving than the major one, and one much slower-moving. The D-2-labeled triplexes (Fig. 6a) also show one major photoproduct, but three faster moving minor products, and one much slower moving one. The slower moving band has the same mobility in both cases and it is also visible when PsT-2 is labeled (not shown). Hence, this slower moving photoproduct contains D1, D2, and PsT-2; it is therefore identified as a crosslink between PsT-2 and D-1·D-2. Based upon the sequence of the triplex, previous observations (17Posvic T.J. Dervan P.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 3059-3061Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar), the yield, and primer extension results described below, the major D-1-labeled photoproduct is identified as a monoadduct between PsT-2 and D-1 at residue T11, whereas the faster running minor product is probably the monoadduct formed at residue T9 of D-1. Similar considerations, including primer extension results (not shown), identify the major D-2-labeled photoproduct as a monoadduct between PsT-2 and residue T22 of D-2 and the three faster moving minor products as monoadducts formed with residues C21, C23, and C24, respectively. The major D-1 monoadduct, which amounts to more than 50% of the total photoproduct, represents psoralen interaction with the mutated T nucleotide of the human sickle cell hemoglobin gene. As indicated in Fig. 6b, ∼ 40% of the D-1 strand is converted to the major photoproduct by 5 min of irradiation. In contrast, the photocrosslinked product forms at much lower yield (<3%) and does not level off over the timecourse studied, which is consistent with previous observations (5Havre P.A. Gunther E.J. Gasparro F.P. Glazer P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7879-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 19Gasparro F.P. Havre P.A. Olack G.A. Gunther E.J. Glazer P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2845-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The kinetics of major photoproduct formation is similar for the D-1- and D-2-labeled complexes (Fig. 6b). The maximum yield is attained by 5 min of irradiation and levels off. The yield is significantly lower for the major D-2 monoadduct (15 versus 40%). This is consistent with the more distant location of the target residue in that strand and the less favorable orientation of the intercalated psoralen moiety (18Galas D.J. Shmitz A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 55: 3157-3170Crossref Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows the dependence of photoproduct yield on pH. The yield decreases significantly as pH is increased from 5 to 7. Additional modifications of the third strand sequence that use C analogs that need not be protonated should improve binding at physiological pH (22Berressem B.R. Engels J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3465-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Rajeev K.G. Jadhav V.R. Ganesh K.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4187-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To confirm the photoaddition site of the major D-1 photoproduct, it was eluted from PAGE gel slices and used as a DNA template in primer extension reactions (20Sage E. Moustacchi E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3307-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 21Guieysse A.-L. Praseuth D. Grigoriev M. Harel-Bellan A. Hélène C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4210-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Fig. 8 shows these results along with a mixed ddNTP sequencing ladder obtained from nonirradiated D-1 control strands. It can be seen that synthesis continues only up to residue T11. Apparently, the polymerase is unable to synthesize past the PsT-2 photoattachment site. This observation identifies residue T11, the site of the A·T → T·A human sickle cell transversion, as the major site of psoralen photoaddition. Similar observations on photoproducts formed with the D-2 target strand confirm the sites of photoattachment indicated above (data not shown). Band-shift assays (Fig. 9) indicate that whereas PsT-3, the scrambled third strand, does not bind to the plasmid with the β-globin sickle cell target, PsT-2, the third strand with the duplex-forming hook, does bind to it, though not to the vector plasmid without the target. Moreover, the binding is very much greater to the supercoiled than to open circular or linearized plasmid. These results suggest high promise for our overall approach. With respect to our long term goal, this study indicates that the efficiency of photochemical modification at the desired target site is relatively high; 40% of the duplex target is converted to monoadduct at the pyrimidine residue of the mutated base pair. Another 2% at this site are crosslinked, whereas a minor photoproduct on this strand accounts for ∼8% of the duplex. The C16 psoralen linker additionally permits substantial photoproduct formation of the opposite target strand. Model building suggests that shortening the linker should substantially reduce or even eliminate those reactions, in which case the yield and specificity of the desired psoralen photoaddition can be raised. In fact, preliminary experiments demonstrate that use of a C6 psoralen linker markedly reduces photoproduct formation with the noncoding strand. It would appear that early steps of a strategy for triplex-mediated repair of the sickle cell mutation are now in place. A strand has been designed with suitable affinity for third strand binding, which forms a psoralen monoadduct to the mutated base pair in high yield. DNA under superhelical stress unwinds to relieve this stress, thereby creating dynamic unwound single-stranded patches no less accessible than the sticky end in the linear target. In fact, the preliminary results suggest that this third strand with the hook is capable of binding to a supercoiled plasmid containing the target sequence, indicative of a strand-invading mechanism (28Gamper Jr., H.B. Hou Y.-M. Stamm M.R. Podyminogin M.A. Meyer R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 2182-2183Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This opens the possibility of exploiting various DNA repair mechanisms that have been shown to effect site-specific base pair changes. For example, T·A → A·T substitutions in the supF gene have been triggered in vivo by third strand-directed psoralen photomodification of plasmids transfected into monkey COS-7 cells (6Wang G. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Science. 1996; 271: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 7Faruqi A.F. Seidman M.M. Segal D.J. Carroll D. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell.

Using the methodology developed, it is anticipated that the sickle cell mutation may be similarly repaired. In that event, acceptable levels of the correct phenotype might be achieved if psoralen monoadduct-triggeredin vivo mutation efficiencies are sufficiently high. Chimeric structures with linked duplex and triplex elements have been exploited for other purposes (24François J.-C. Hélène C.

In this study, the duplex-forming hook represents a novel approach for achieving effective third strand binding to a relatively poor DNA duplex target, coupled to a potential for strand invasion. Direct comparison of binding affinity to the same target (by photoproduct formation) of a third strand with a hook versus a hookless third strand demonstrates at least 1,000-fold difference in Kd values. Moreover, the hookless third strand does not induce a band-shift on native PAGE even at high third strand concentrations (Fig. 2). This indicates that the complex is transient and is trapped only by formation of covalent photoproducts under UV-irradiation. In contrast, the addition of the duplex-forming hook to the third strand makes the complex stable even without irradiation. The approach developed in the present work should find wider applicability to other unfavorable target sequences. We are grateful to Peter Glazer for helpful discussions. We thank Lydia Lin, Neelesh Prakash, and Katherine Lee for valuable assistance and Dmitry Klimov for help with preparation of the figures."

A variety of growth factors and hormones exert their cellular effects via interactions with specific receptors that possess protein kinase activities. The interaction of most of these ligands with their receptors induces tyrosine kinase activation and phosphorylation of the receptor and/or intracellular substrates. The tyrosine-phosphorylated protein serves as a docking protein for several cytoplasmic substrates with SH2 domains (1Carpenter G.

However, our findings that the lipid products of p85/p110-type PI kinase in vivo differ markedly from those produced by a conventional in vitro method used to determine the substrate specificity of PI kinase are of great interest.

Two days after the fibroblasts had reached confluence, differentiation was induced by treating the cells with DMEM containing 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 4 mg/ml dexamethasone, and 10% fetal bovine serum for 48 h. Cells were re-fed with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum every other day. Infection with the indicated adenoviruses was carried out on day 3 post-differentiation induction, and the experiments were conducted on day 5, at which point >90% of the cells expressed the adipocyte phenotype. Cloning and construct-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were performed to amplify full-length p110β from human embryonic heart cDNA, based on its reported sequence (9Hu P. Mondino A. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7677-7688Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The entire coding region of p110α cDNA was obtained as described in our previous report (7Katagiri H. Asano T. Ishihara H. Inukai K. Shibasaki Y. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. J. Biol.

The cDNAs coding for the kinase-dead point mutants of p110α (ΔKinα) and p110β (ΔKinβ), which lack amino acids 917–950 of p110α and amino acids 921–954 of p110β, were designed as reported previously (10Hu Q.

A portion of human GLUT2 cDNA corresponding to residues 510–524 was ligated to each cDNA to generate catalytic subunits of PI 3-kinase tagged at their C termini. The entire coding regions of p110α, p110β, and their kinase-dead point mutants, all of which have an epitope GLUT2 tag at their C termini, were cloned into transfer vectors (either pBacPAK8 or pBacPAK9). The entire coding region of LacZ fromEscherichia coli was also cloned into pBacPAK8. Recombinant baculoviruses were obtained by homologous recombination between the recombinant transfer vectors and their parental virus genome according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). To obtain recombinant adenoviruses, the expression cosmid cassette pAdexCAwt was ligated with each of the cDNAs coding for either LacZ from E. coli or epitope-tagged p110α, followed by homologous recombination between the recombinant cosmid cassette and its parental virus genome, as described previously (7Katagiri H.

Recombinant adenovirus expressing Δp85α was prepared as described previously (12Katagiri H. Asano T. Inukai K. Ogihara T. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Murata T. Terasaki J. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; : E326-E331PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in PBS containing 1% Triton, 0.35 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 mm sodium vanadate. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble materials. The supernatants were incubated with the indicated antibodies, followed by the addition of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Alternatively, in some experiments, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-hemagglutinin antibodies, followed by the addition of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, boiled in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol, and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting was performed with the ECL system according to the manufacturer's instructions. In some experiments, the band intensities were quantitated with a Model GS-525 molecular imager (Bio-Rad). Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus were lysed with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.35 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then immunoprecipitated with anti-C-terminal GLUT2 tag antibodies and protein A-Sepharose. 3T3-L1 adipocytes (in 24-well culture dishes) were serum-starved for 3 h in DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The cells were incubated with 10−6m insulin for 5 min; washed with ice-cold PBS; and then lysed with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.35 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 mm sodium vanadate. Cell lysates were precleared of insoluble materials by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min) and were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and protein A-Sepharose. The PI 3-kinase activity in the immunoprecipitates was measured as described previously (7Katagiri H. Asano T. Ishihara H. Inukai K. Shibasaki Y. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16987-16990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). When indicated, the membrane fraction of Sf9 cells, prepared as described previously (13DeTomaso A.W. Xie Z.J. Liu G. Mercer R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1470-1478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used as the substrate instead of purified PI from a commercial source. The reaction products were deacylated and analyzed by HPLC. In some experiments, wortmannin or LY294002 at the indicated concentrations was added to the reaction mixture of the in vitro PI kinase assay, and the inhibitory effects on 32P-labeled phosphoinositide synthesis were investigated. To exclude the possibility that D-3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides may activate some unknown PI 4-kinase in the membrane fraction, resulting in the synthesis of D-4-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, purified D-3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides were prepared by incubating purified PI, PI-4-P, or PI-4,5-P2 with nonradioactive ATP and p110α immunoprecipitates in vitro. Phosphoinositides labeled with unlabeled phosphate groups on their D-3 positions (PI-3-P, PI-3,4-P2, and PI-3,4,5-P3) were separated by TLC, followed by chloroform extraction. Each of them was dried and mixed with Sf9 cell membrane fraction in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. 3T3-L1 adipocytes infected with an adenovirus containing p110α, Δp85α, or control LacZ DNA were phosphate-starved overnight in phosphate-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), followed by serum starvation for 3 h. [32P]Orthophosphate (0.1 mCi/ml) was added, and the cells were cultured for an additional 2 h. Following the labeling period, cells were incubated with or without 10−6m insulin for 15 min. The reaction was then terminated with an ice-cold PBS wash, followed by the addition of methanol and 1n HCl (1:1) and finally lipid extraction with chloroform. A similar procedure was performed in the experiments using Sf9 cells. Sf9 cells infected with the indicated baculovirus were also phosphate-starved for 18 h and then labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (0.1 mCi/ml) for 2 h. The extracted lipid was deacylated and subjected to anion-exchange HPLC using a Partisphere strong anion-exchange column (Whatman) as described previously (14Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The radioactivity was detected with an on-line radiochemical detector. Deacylated [3H]PI-4-P and [3H]PI-4,5-P2 were used as internal standards. 32P-Labeled PI-3-P, PI-3,4-P2, and PI-3,4,5-P3 generated in vitro as described above were also deacylated and used as internal standards. Each sample and standard were co-injected with the nonradioactive nucleotides ADP and ATP for each HPLC analysis. Deacylated PI-4-P and PI-4,5-P2 were successfully separated from deacylated PI-5-P and PI-3,5-P2, as reported previously (15Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). p85/p110-type PI kinase has been identified through its ability to associate with many tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates and has been considered to phosphorylate the D-3 position of the inositol ring in phosphoinositides (6Stephens L.R.

However, of great interest are our findings that the lipid products of p85/p110-type PI kinase in vivo differ markedly from those produced by a conventionalin vitro method used to determine the substrate specificity of each PI kinase. First, recombinant baculoviruses that express either p110α or p110β with a tagged epitope at their COOH terminus were prepared. Sf9 cells were infected with either p110α or p110β recombinant virus or control LacZ virus, and similar expression levels were obtained among them (Fig. 1A). Immunoprecipitates with antibodies against the tag were subjected toin vitro lipid kinase assays using purified PI as substrates, followed by HPLC analysis (Fig. 1, B and C). The major product was PI-3-P with p110α immunoprecipitates, although small amounts of PI-4-P and PI-3,4-P2 were also detected. Based on the amounts of PI-3-P, PI-4-P, and PI-3,4-P2 produced, the in vitro lipid kinase activity of p110α immunoprecipitates at the D-4 position was estimated to be 4% of that at the D-3 position. On the contrary, immunoprecipitates of p110β, another isoform of the catalytic subunit, produced <1% of the PI-3-P produced by p110α immunoprecipitates, and no generation of PI-4-P or PI-3,4-P2 was detected. These results indicate that the catalytic subunits of p85/p110-type PI kinase, p110α and p110β, are indeed PI kinases for the D-3 position. Quite different results were obtained when trichloroacetic acid-treated cell membranes were used as substrates for p110α or p110β, instead of purified PI. Treating the cell membranes with 10% trichloroacetic acid apparently denatures the protein contained in the cell membrane fraction, and trichloroacetic acid-treated cell membrane did not significantly incorporate 32P into the lipid (data not shown). In the assay using trichloroacetic acid-treated membrane from Sf9 cells as a substrate (Fig. 2B), p110α immunoprecipitates produced PI-4-P in an amount comparable to that of PI-3-P. Similarly, PI-4-P and PI-3-P were detected in p110β immunoprecipitates, and the level of the former was ∼5.4 times the level of the latter. The amount of PI-3-P produced in p110β immunoprecipitates was 19% of that produced in p110α immunoprecipitates, whereas nearly the same amount of PI-4-P was produced in p110α and p110β immunoprecipitates. To rule out the possible contamination of PI 4-kinase in the p110 immunoprecipitates and to confirm that p110 itself possesses PI 4-kinase activity, we performed two experiments using kinase-dead point mutants of p110 (Fig. 2, A and B) and lipid kinase inhibitors (Fig. 2, C and D). First, p110α, p110β, and their kinase-dead point mutants (ΔKinα and ΔKinβ, respectively) were expressed at a similar level in Sf9 cells (Fig. 2A). It was shown that the lipid kinase activities of the p110 proteins for both the D-3 and D-4 positions were completely abolished by introducing kinase-dead point mutations in their lipid kinase domains (Fig. 2B). In addition, both PI 3- and PI 4-kinase activities of p110α or p110β immunoprecipitates were inhibited similarly by either wortmannin or LY294002 (Fig. 2, C and D). Wortmannin and LY294002 are recognized as specific inhibitors of p110, with much higher concentrations being necessary for the inhibition of other lipid kinases (19Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, to exclude the possibility that D-3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides may activate some unknown PI 4-kinase in the membrane fraction, resulting in the synthesis of D-4-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, purified nonradioactive D-3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides (PI-3-P, PI-3,4-P2, or PI-3,4,5-P3) were added to a mixture of trichloroacetic acid-treated cell fraction and [γ-32P]ATP. As a result, no D-4-phosphorylated phosphoinositide labeled with 32P was observed (Fig. 2B, last column), which excludes the possibility mentioned above. In addition, when purified PI-3-P, PI-3,4-P2, or PI-3,4,5-P3 labeled with32P at the D-3 position was incubated with trichloroacetic acid-treated cell membrane, no phosphoinositide labeled with32P at the D-4 position was synthesized (data not shown). This indicates that transfer of 32P from the D-3 position to the D-4 position is quite unlikely. Taken together, it is very likely that the PI 4-kinase activities observed in the p110 immunoprecipitate are attributable to p110 itself. Subsequently, to demonstrate that p85/p110-type PI kinase actually exhibits PI 4-kinase activity in vivo, either p110α or p110β was first overexpressed in Sf9 cells, followed by [32P]orthophosphate labeling. Sf9 cells overexpressing either p110α or p110β at a similar level significantly accumulated each phosphoinositide, as compared with control cells, the exception being PI-3,4,5-P3 in p110β-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3). The increases in PI-4-P and PI-4,5-P2 were comparable to the increase in PI-3-P induced by p110α overexpression and even greater than the increases in PI-3,4-P2 and PI-3,4,5-P3, which suggests that p110 overexpression induces accumulation of not only D-3-phosphorylated, but also D-4-phosphorylated phosphoinositides in vivo. Essentially the same results were obtained with the overexpression of both p110 and its regulatory subunit, p85 (data not shown). p110β overexpression induced accumulation of D-4-phosphorylated phosphoinositides at a much higher level than that of D-3 in Sf9 cells, which suggests that p110β may function as a PI 4-kinase predominantly in intact cells. Further study should be addressed to determine the mechanism that causes the difference in substrate specificity between p110α and p110β. Finally, to demonstrate that endogenous p85/p110 produces not only D-3-phosphorylated, but also D-4-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, and to examine the effect of insulin on the level of phosphorylation of phosphoinositides, either p110α or dominant-negative p85α was overexpressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and the cellular level of each phosphoinositide in the absence or presence of insulin was investigated. p110α was overexpressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using an adenovirus expression system (Fig. 4A, upper panel) at a level approximately five times that expressed endogenously in 3T3-L1 cells (lower panel). The cellular ATP level was essentially unaltered by p110 overexpression (data not shown). The amount of overexpressed p110α with the adenovirus expression system is much smaller than that with the baculovirus expression system. Thus, increases in the amounts of PI-3,4-P2, PI-4,5-P2, and PI-3,4,5-P3 accumulated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 4B) were smaller than those in Sf9 cells (Fig. 3), but such increases were still obvious. Interestingly, the increase in PI-4-P in 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing p110α was much larger than that in PI-3-P, although they were almost comparable in Sf9 cells overexpressing p110α. The reason for these differences according to cell type remains unclear, but the conformation of p110 may differ somewhat by an unknown modification, such as serine/threonine phosphorylation, according to whether p110 is expressed in Sf9 cells or in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Insulin showed no additive effect on the amount of each phosphoinositide in p110α-overexpressing cells, which also agrees well with our previous report that no additive effect of insulin and p110α overexpression on GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface was observed (7Katagiri H. Asano T. Ishihara H. Inukai K. Shibasaki Y. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16987-16990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition, very clear results were obtained in the experiment using Δp85α with a hemagglutinin tag at its C terminus (Fig. 4C, upper panel). By overexpressing Δp85α, which inhibits the normal activation of endogenous p110, we were able to investigate the function of endogenous p85/p110. In this experiment, the expression level of Δp85α was ∼10 times that of endogenous p85α (Fig. 4C, middle panel), which almost completely inhibited the insulin-induced activation of endogenous p110 (lower panel). To determine precisely the effect of insulin on phosphoinositide phosphorylation, we calculated the amount of freshly labeled phosphoinositide during 15 min of insulin stimulation by subtracting the radioactivity from that labeled with32P during the 2-h incubation before insulin treatment. As indicated in Fig. 4D (by the numbers outside the parentheses), in the control cells, insulin raised32P-labeled PI-3-P, PI-4-P, and PI-4,5-P2 to 7.3, 35.0, and 3.4 times the respective levels of their freshly labeled counterparts without stimuli. By overexpressing Δp85α, insulin-stimulated production of PI-3,4-P2, PI-4,5-P2, and PI-3,4,5-P3 decreased to nearly undetectable levels and that of PI-3-P and PI-4-P decreased by ∼70 and 98%, respectively (Fig. 4D). These results clearly indicate that insulin induces accumulation of both D-3- and D-4-phosphorylated phosphoinositides via the activation of endogenous p85/p110-type PI kinase. In addition, it should be noted that p85/p110-type PI kinase, but none of the other PI-4 kinases, appears to be critical for the insulin-induced synthesis of D-4-phosphorylated phosphoinositides in 3T3-L1 cells. As yet, there have been no reports of p85/p110-type PI kinase with PI 4-kinase activities or that growth factors/hormones stimulate PI 4-kinases. There are two possible explanations for these going unnoticed. One is that researchers have assumed that the in vitro PI kinase assay using purified PI as a substrate reflects the physiological reaction that takes place intracellularly. However, phosphoinositides are a rather minor component of phospholipids, usually composing <10%. The remaining phospholipids are phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine. Without these components around phosphoinositides, the conformation of lipid kinases might be altered. This may explain the exhibition by p85/p110-type PI kinase of a substrate specificity different from that observed with purified PI, as was reported for some isoforms of protein kinase C (21Lomasney J.-W. Cheng H.-F. Wang L.P. Kuan Y.-S. Liu S.-M. Fesik S.W. King K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25316-25326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition, recently, the substrate specificity of PI 4-P-5-kinases, which has been reported based on in vitroassay, was also corrected (15Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Thus, it is understandable that results obtained from the artificial in vitro assay do not reflect the actual intracellular situation. The other possible reason is that many investigators employed stimulation with epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, or platelet-derived growth factor to analyze the function of p85/p110-type PI kinase (22Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Soltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 23Carter A.N. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14563-14567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Jackson T.R. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16627-16636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation with these growth factors does activate p85/p110-type PI kinase, but phospholipase Cγ, which hydrolyzes PI-4,5-P2 (25Carpenter G. Hernandez S.S. Nishibe S. Todderud G. Mumby M. Wahl M. CIBA Found. Symp. 1992; 164 (233–239): 223-233PubMed Google Scholar), is also activated. Thus, as reported previously, epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, or platelet-derived growth factor does not increase the amount of PI-4,5-P2, despite the possibly generation by activated p85/p110-type PI kinase of PI-4,5-P2 probably via PI-4-P production. Because of this complicated alteration in the amount of D-4-phosphorylated phosphoinositide, it seems that earlier studies did not pay attention to the effect of p85/p110-type PI kinase on the amount of D-4-phosphorylated phosphoinositide. In contrast, insulin stimulation does not lead to phospholipase Cγ activation (26Wahl M.I. Jones G.A. Nishibe S. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10447-10456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the generation of D-4-phosphorylated phosphoinositides (PI-4-P and PI-4,5-P2) by p85/p110-type PI kinase became as apparent as that of D-3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides (PI-3-P, PI-3,4-P2, and PI-3,4,5-P3). However, even in the case of insulin stimulation, since the cell has significant basal PI 4-kinase activity, if cells are prelabeled with 32P for too long a period (12 h or longer), the effect of insulin for a very short time would be difficult to detect. This is the reason we labeled the cells for 2 h. In the living body, cells are always stimulated by many factors in the serum. It is thus reasonable to consider the PI 4-kinase activity of p85/p110 to be important for the regulation of D-4-phosphorylated phosphoinositides since p85/p110 is likely to be the only enzyme that phosphorylates the D-4 position in response to insulin. The importance of D-4-phosphorylated phosphoinositides has been established by several investigators. PI-4,5-P2 regulates the function of several actin-binding proteins (27Fukami K. Furuhashi K.

Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), some of which reportedly occur in response to growth factor/hormone stimuli in parallel with p85/p110-type PI kinase activation. Thus, some of these cellular events might be attributable to D-4-phosphorylated phosphoinositides produced by p85/p110-type PI kinase. In addition, PI-4,5-P2 plays an important role as a precursor for the second messengers diacylglycerol, inositol 1,4,5-P3 (25Carpenter G. Hernandez S.S. Nishibe S. Todderud G. Mumby M. Wahl M. CIBA Found. Symp. 1992; 164 (233–239): 223-233PubMed Google Scholar), and PI-3,4,5-P3 (22Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Soltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). In this respect, the cellular content of PI-4,5-P2 might affect the signal intensity of phospholipase Cγ. Our surprising findings also raise the possibility that the substrate specificity of various lipid kinases and phosphatases, when incubated with purified phosphoinositide in anin vitro assay, might be different from the true,i.e. cellular, substrate specificity.

Other substitutions, including cysteine, glutamate, serine, threonine, and tyrosine, failed to show any activity. Enzyme I Km for His15 → Asp HPr is increased 10-fold and Vmax is decreased 1000-fold compared with wild type HPr. The phosphorylation of Asp15 led to a spontaneous internal rearrangement involving the loss of the phosphoryl group and a water molecule, which was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The protein species formed had a higher pI than His15 → Asp HPr, which could arise from the formation of a succinimide or an isoimide. Hydrolysis of the isolated high pI form gave only aspartic acid at residue 15, and no isoaspartic acid was detected. This indicates that an isoimide rather than a succinimide is formed. In the absence of phosphorylation, no formation of the high pI form could be found, indicating that phosphorylation catalyzed the formation of the cyclization. The possible involvement of Asn12 in an internal cyclization with Asp15 was eliminated by the Asn12 → Ala mutation in His15 → AspHPr. Asn12 substitutions of alanine, aspartate, serine, and threonine in wild type HPr indicated a general requirement for residues capable of forming a hydrogen bond with the Nε2 atom of His15, but elimination of the hydrogen bond has only a 4-fold decrease inkcat/Km.

The protein species formed had a higher pI than His15 → Asp HPr, which could arise from the formation of a succinimide or an isoimide. Hydrolysis of the isolated high pI form gave only aspartic acid at residue 15, and no isoaspartic acid was detected. This indicates that an isoimide rather than a succinimide is formed. In the absence of phosphorylation, no formation of the high pI form could be found, indicating that phosphorylation catalyzed the formation of the cyclization. The possible involvement of Asn12 in an internal cyclization with Asp15 was eliminated by the Asn12 → Ala mutation in His15 → AspHPr. Asn12 substitutions of alanine, aspartate, serine, and threonine in wild type HPr indicated a general requirement for residues capable of forming a hydrogen bond with the Nε2 atom of His15, but elimination of the hydrogen bond has only a 4-fold decrease inkcat/Km. Histidine-containing protein, HPr, is a small phosphocarrier protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). 1The abbreviations used are: PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system; IEF, isoelectric focusing; PEP, phos phoenolpyruvate.1The abbreviations used are: PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system; IEF, isoelectric focusing; PEP, phos phoenolpyruvate. The PTS is a bacterial system that transports and phosphorylates many sugars and is involved in major regulatory events of carbohydrate metabolism (see reviews in Refs. 1Meadow N.D. Fox D.K.

(5Kundig W.W. Ghosh S. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 52: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) when the function of accepting and donating a phosphoryl group from enzyme I to the sugar-specific enzymes II was established for Escherichia coli. These events result in phosphoprotein formation with a Nε2-P-histidine in both enzyme I (6Weigel N. Kukuruzinska M.A. Nakazawa T. Waygood E.B. Roseman S. J. Biol.

The structure of HPr from a number of species is now well established from both x-ray diffraction and NMR spectrometry approaches. The overall structure of the HPrs is described as an open-faced β-sandwich with a βαββαβα fold (see reviews in Refs. 10Jia Z. Quail J.W. Delbaere L.T.J. Waygood E.B. Biochem.

In order to help specify phosphoryl transfer to the Nδ1 atom of the His15 imidazole ring, various residues have been proposed to form hydrogen bonds with the Nε2 atom of the His15 imidazole. In E. coli, the involvement of a glutamate residue was suggested (9Waygood E.B. Erickson E.E. El-Kabbani O.A.L. Delbaere L.T.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6938-6945Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and was identified as Glu85 by the first 1The abbreviations used are: PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system; IEF, isoelectric focusing; PEP, phos phoenolpyruvate.H NMR structure (13Klevit R.E. Waygood E.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7774-7781Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and the 2.0 Å resolution x-ray structure (14Jia Z. Quail J.W. Waygood E.B. Delbaere L.T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22490-22501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the latter showing that the interaction was with the C-terminal α-carboxylate. Replacement or deletion of Glu85 did not indicate a significant role for this residue (15Anderson J.W. Bhanot P. Georges F. Klevit R.E. Waygood E.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9601-9607Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). NMR spectral properties of His15 inE. coli HPr were consistent with hydrogen bonding to the Nε2 atom (16van Dijk A.A. De Lange L.C.M. Bachovchin W.W. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8164-8171Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and van Nuland et al. (17van Nuland N.A.J. Boelens R. Scheek R.M. Robillard G.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) suggested Asn12 as the most likely residue. Subsequently, in the 2.5 Å resolution structure of the complex of the Jel42 monoclonal antibody Fab fragment with HPr, the Asn12 side chain was found hydrogen-bonded to the Nε2 atom of His15 (18Prasad L. Waygood E.B. Lee J.S. Delbaere L.T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 829-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Asn12 in E. coli HPr has been investigated because it is a site of deamidation, which occurs through the formation of a succinimide to form aspartate and isoaspartate at residue 12 (19Sharma S. Hammen P.K. Anderson J.W. Leung A. Georges F. Hengstenberg W. Klevit R.E. Waygood E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17695-17704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The succinimide formation (Fig. 1A), especially at Asn-Gly pairs in a sequence leads to about 70% isoaspartic acid formation (20Clarke S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1987; 30: 808-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 21Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wright H.T. Crit.

Stability of Protein Pharmaceuticals: Chemical and Physical Pathways of Protein Degradation. Plenum Press, New York1992: 1-29Google Scholar). This unusual amino acid can be repaired to aspartic acid by protein carboxylmethyltransferase (l-isoaspartate-(d-aspartate)O-methyltransferase) in peptides (24McFadden P.N. Clarke S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2460-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and the effective repair of residue 12 isoaspartic acid in HPr has been described (25Brennan T.V. Anderson J.W. Jia Z. Waygood E.B. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24586-24595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substitution of aspartate or isoaspartate at residue 12 has modest effects on the phosphocarrier role of HPr (19Sharma S. Hammen P.K. Anderson J.W. Leung A. Georges F. Hengstenberg W. Klevit R.E. Waygood E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17695-17704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of succinimides can occur at aspartate residues but usually under different conditions than those that prevail for asparagine residues. A stable succinimide has been characterized in somatotropin where cyclization of an aspartyl residue under acidic conditions allows the isolation of the succinimide that is labile at alkaline pH (26Violand B.N. Schlittler M.R. Kolodziej E.W. Toren P.C. Cabonce M.A. Siegel N.R. Duffin K.L. Zobel J.F. Smith C.E. Tou J.S. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1634-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A structure of a succinimide formed by an aspartyl residue at acidic pH has recently been described in lysozyme (27Noguchi S. Miyawaki K. Satow Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In both cases, the hydrolysis of the succinimide yielded both isoaspartic and aspartic acid. The mechanism of succinimide formation is not the only route by which deamidation can occur (20Clarke S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1987; 30: 808-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 21Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wright H.T. Crit.

Stability of Protein Pharmaceuticals: Chemical and Physical Pathways of Protein Degradation. Plenum Press, New York1992: 1-29Google Scholar), and among the possibilities is the formation of an isoimide shown in Fig. 1B. In this paper, we describe the effects of other substitutions at residue 12 and the lack of an absolute requirement for a histidine at residue 15 of HPr. Aspartate substitutes for histidine at residue 15 in phosphoryl acceptance and transfer, albeit inefficiently. In addition, the P-aspartyl residue leads to a spontaneous chemical rearrangement with the characteristics of catalyzed isoimide formation. Enzyme I, the enzymes IIsugar, and DNA oligonucleotides were obtained as described previously (28Anderson J.W. Pullen K. Georges F. Klevit R.E. Waygood E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12325-12333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ampholytes were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. DEAE paper (D81) was from Whatman. The Quik-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit was obtained from Stratagene. [32P]Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) was produced as described previously (29Mattoo R.L. Waygood E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 128: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). His15 → Asp and His15→ Glu HPr mutants were produced by Dr. J. W. Anderson. Asn12 → Asp HPr has been described (19Sharma S. Hammen P.K. Anderson J.W. Leung A. Georges F. Hengstenberg W. Klevit R.E. Waygood E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17695-17704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and all other mutations were produced by the Quik-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. All mutations were in the ptsH gene incorporated into pUC19 (15Anderson J.W. Bhanot P. Georges F. Klevit R.E. Waygood E.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9601-9607Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). His15 → Ala HPr was obtained from M Scholtz (Texas A & M). HPr and mutant HPrs were expressed in E. coli strain ESK108, which isptsH (28Anderson J.W. Pullen K. Georges F. Klevit R.E. Waygood E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12325-12333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the pUC(ptsH) plasmids with HPr expression under the control of its own promoter. Homogeneous protein was produced as described previously (15Anderson J.W. Bhanot P. Georges F. Klevit R.E. Waygood E.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9601-9607Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Yields were 50–500 mg of protein/30 g of wet weight of cells. His15 → Asp HPr (3 mg) was phosphorylated at 37 °C for 10 min in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with 5 mm PEP and 0.1 mg enzyme I. The three forms of His15 → Asp HPr, phosphorylated (lower pI), unphosphorylated, and cyclized (higher pI) were separated by anion exchange chromatography, Mini-Q-Sepharose column, and a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Gradifrac system at 4 °C. The reaction mixture was loaded with 10 mm citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 4.6, and the column was eluted at 2 ml/min with a 20-ml gradient to 0.07 m NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and protein elution was monitored at 214 nm. Protein sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems, Inc. model 471A sequencer equipped with a model MG5 microgradient pump and a blot cartridge for polyvinylidene difluoride-type membranes. Data were acquired and analyzed using an Applied Biosystems Inc. model 601A data system (30Robertson A.J. Ishikawa M. Gusta L.V. MacKenzie S.L. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The sequencing was carried out by Dr. S. Mackenzie (Plant Biotechnology Institute, National Research Council of Canada, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada). Mass spectrometry was performed using a Perseptive Biosystems Voyager ELITE matrix-assisted laser diode ionization-time of flight spectrometer at the Plant Biotechnology Institute. The samples were run in linear mode. Crystals of His15 → Asp HPr were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 14 °C. Washing and seeding of microcrystals was used (31Thaller C. Weaver L.H. Eichele G. Wilson E. Karlsson R. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 147: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Crystals formed in 0.1 m citrate phosphate buffer, pH 4.4, and 20–25% saturated ammonium sulfate. Crystals of the high pI form of His15 → Asp HPr, containing a putative cyclized Asp15 were grown similarly. Synchrotron diffraction data for His15 → Asp HPr were collected with a Brandeis CCD detector at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (Upton, NY). For the high pI form, data were collected at the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan) using a wavelength of 1.0 Å and a screenless Weissenberg camera. The data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (32.Otwinski, Z., Data Collection and Processing: Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend, January 29–30, 1993, Warrington, UK, Sawyer, L., Isaacs, N., Bailey, S., 1993, 56, 62, SERC, Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK.Google Scholar). The structures were solved as has previously been described for Ser46 → Asp HPr (33Napper S. Anderson J.W. Georges F. Quail J.W. Delbaere L.T.J. Waygood E.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11260-11267Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using the Amore suite of programs (34CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) with molecular replacement with wild type HPr (11Herzberg O. Klevit R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Refinement was performed using the X-PLOR 3.1 package (35Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual, version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). The gene for enzyme IIAglc,crr, was isolated by polymerase chain reaction from pTSHIC9 (36Erni B. Zanolari B. Graff P. Kocher H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18733-18741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and introduced into pT7-7 (37Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.H. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar) using the NdeI and BamHI restriction endonuclease sites. Enzyme IIglc was expressed in E. coli strain ESK262, which is Kan R::ptsH, following mid-log phase induction by 0.5 mmisopropylthiogalactoside. This strain was constructed by ligating the KanR gene from pUC4 into the PstI restriction endonuclease site in ptsH in pAB65 (38Lee L.G. Britton P. Parra F. Boronat A. Kornberg H.L. FEBS Lett. 1982; 149: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The linearized plasmid was used to transform E. coli strain DPB271 (39Russell C.B. Thaler D.S. Dahlquist F.W. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2609-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is recD, and a ptsH gene replacement derivative was selected by kanamycin resistance. This E. coli strain ESK150 had no HPr detectable by assay, phosphorylation, or immunoreactivity as determined by standard methods (40Waygood E.B. Reiche B. Hengstenberg W. Lee J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2810-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strain was a derivative of strain BL21 plysS (37Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.H. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar), which was transduced with P1-phage grown on strain ESK150 to produce a Kan R ::ptsH strain ESK262. Enzyme I was also overproduced in this strain using a similar plasmid. 2S. Brokx, J. Taylor, F. Georges, and E. B. Waygood, submitted for publication. His15 → Asp HPr and derivatives were assayed for methyl accepting ability by incubation with S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine and l-isoaspartate-(d-aspartate)O-methyltransferase. Wild type HPr was used as a control. The assays were performed by J. D. Lowenson and S. Clarke (UCLA) as described previously (25Brennan T.V. Anderson J.W. Jia Z. Waygood E.B. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24586-24595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Standard methods have been described for characterization of HPr:protein determinations (15Anderson J.W. Bhanot P.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6938-6945Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and enzyme I and enzyme IIAsugar assays (15Anderson J.W. Bhanot P. Georges F. Klevit R.E. Waygood E.B.

The following substitutions for His15in E. coli HPr were made: alanine, asparagine, aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, glutamine, serine, threonine, and tyrosine. Except for His15 → Asp HPr, none of these mutations showed any detectable activity when tested for activity with enzyme I by: (a) a spectrophotometric assay for enzyme I activity (43Waygood E.B. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); (b) [32P]-protein labeling by PEP detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (42Waygood E.B. Mattoo R.L. Peri K.G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 25: 139-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); (c) a gel shift of a band on an isoelectric focusing (IEF) gel because of the introduction of the phosphoryl group (9Waygood E.B. Erickson E.E. El-Kabbani O.A.L. Delbaere L.T.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6938-6945Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); and (d) in vivo complementation of the fermentation negative phenotype of the ptsH strain, E. coliESK108. His15 → Asp HPr, when incubated with PEP, enzyme I, and Mg2+, revealed two new species, one with a lower pI and another with a higher pI (Fig. 2,A and B). The formation of the high pI form was not efficient at room temperature (22 °C) but was readily detected at 37 °C (Fig. 2C). When [32P]PEP was used, the lower pI band was shown to contain [32P]phosphate by autoradiography; the higher pI band did not have a phosphoryl group (Fig. 2, D and E). Enzyme I phosphotransfer activity was measured using His15 → Asp HPr and was shown to have a Km of 66 μm for His15 → Asp HPr (wild type HPr Km 6 μm) and a Vmax that was 0.1% of that obtained with wild type HPr. The impairment of the enzyme I reaction was large, and thus much higher amounts of enzyme I were used, greater than 100-fold compared with equivalent experiments with wild type HPr. Assays of the enzymes IIsugar with His15 → Asp HPr would require impractical amounts of enzyme I to meet the requirements of independence of the enzyme II reaction from P-HPr generation (43Waygood E.B. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For this reason, sugar phosphorylation was not measured. In the experiment described below, which showed enzyme IIAglc phosphorylation using [32P]PEP, the protein preparations required the purification of all the PTS proteins from strains of E. colithat did not produce HPr. When this was done, phosphorylation of enzyme IIAglc that was dependent upon the presence of His15 → Asp HPr could be shown (Fig. 3). To assess reactions with other enzymes IIAsugar, an in vivo approach was used. When His15 → Asp HPr was overproduced in vivo, it would not complement sugar fermentation in the ptsHstrain, E. coli ESK108. His15 → Asp HPr has a 10,000-fold impairment; Ser46 → Asp HPr is the next most impaired HPr described, ∼1000-fold, and its overproduction in vivo results in delayed fermentation (33Napper S. Anderson J.W. Georges F. Quail J.W. Delbaere L.T.J. Waygood E.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11260-11267Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). His15 → Asp HPr is not effective in the overall function of the PTS. The pH stability of the different pI species was found by carrying out the phosphorylation reaction and then putting samples at different pHs and following the progress of the loss of species by IEF. These results showed that the high pI form was more stable at acidic pH and that the P-Asp15 HPr was more stable at alkaline pH. The deamidation events at Asn38 and Asn12 in HPr (19Sharma S. Hammen P.K. Anderson J.W. Leung A. Georges F. Hengstenberg W. Klevit R.E. Waygood E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17695-17704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Brennan T.V. Anderson J.W. Jia Z. Waygood E.B. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24586-24595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the higher pI form might be a succinimide ring (Fig. 1). This form results in the loss of a water molecule from the protein, a net loss of 18 mass units. Moreover, when the succinimide hydrolyzes, the normal distribution of products is about 70% isoaspartyl and 30% aspartyl. The resulting HPr species have very similar pIs and have been distinguished by the detection of doublet bands on IEF gels (19Sharma S. Hammen P.K. Anderson J.W. Leung A. Georges F. Hengstenberg W. Klevit R.E. Waygood E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17695-17704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In gels such as shown in Fig. 2, there was no indication of doublet bands for any of the pI species. No increase in protein carboxymethyl transferase methylating activity could be detected with His15 → Asp HPr or the derivatives following phosphorylation. The methylation reaction requires isoaspartyl residues. In addition, N-terminal sequencing of His15 → Asp HPr preparations and the derivatives obtained after dephosphorylation gave normal recoveries of an aspartyl residue at position 15. If an isoaspartyl residue forms, the sequencing reactions do not proceed through the isoaspartyl residue (22Wright H.T. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 27: 1-52Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The high pI form of His15 → Asp HPr was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mass spectroscopy showed a molecular species with 18 mass units less than His15 → Asp HPr (Fig. 4). The isolated high pI form was sequenced from the N terminus, and the sequencing did not proceed beyond residue 14. Incubation of the isolated high pI form at pH 9 led to reversion to the normal His15 → Asp HPr, and N-terminal sequencing identified only an aspartyl residue at position 15 with normal recoveries. When phosphorylation of the reverted form was carried out as described in Fig. 2, the appearance of the phosphorylated and higher pI species was the same (results not shown). These results confirm an unusual structure at residue 15 and the reversibility of the whole process. These findings are consistent with either a succinimide ring formation followed by a very constrained hydrolysis reaction to yield only aspartate or the formation of an isoimide from which hydrolysis would always yield an aspartyl residue (Fig. 1). Phosphohydrolysis of P-Asp HPr was investigated at several pHs. The comparisons with P-His HPr are given in Fig. 5. The structure of His15 → Asp HPr was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Crystallographic parameters are shown in Table I. The 1.5 Å resolution structure of His15 → Asp HPr is essentially the same as the 2.0 Å resolution structure of wild type HPr (14Jia Z. Quail J.W. Waygood E.B. Delbaere L.T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22490-22501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, His15 → Asp HPr had the two differences found in both the 1.6 Å resolution structure of Ser46 → Asp HPr (33Napper S. Anderson J.W. Georges F. Quail J.W. Delbaere L.T.J. Waygood E.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11260-11267Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and the 2.5 Å resolution structure of wild type HPr bound to the Fab fragment of the HPr-specific monoclonal antibody Jel42 (18Prasad L. Waygood E.B. Lee J.S. Delbaere L.T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 829-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); neither the tight β-turn involving Asn12 nor any torsion angle strain at residue 16 was found. The Asp15 residue was well defined (Fig. 6A). One of the oxygen atoms of the Asp15 carboxyl group is in essentially the same position as the Nδ1 atom in the His15 imidazole ring of wild type; the relative distances between the position of the His15 Nδ1 atom in wild type and the positions of the two Asp15 carboxyl oxygen atoms in His15 → Asp HPr are 1.0 and 2.0 Å (Fig. 6B). The C-terminal carboxyl group of Glu85, which has been found hydrogen-bonded with the Nε2 atom of His15, is found in the same position in His15→ Asp HPr (Fig. 6B) as described in wild type and Ser46 → Asp HPrs (14Jia Z.

The side chain of Asp15 is involved in no hydrogen bonds.Table IRefinement parametersHis15 → Asp HPrHigh pI speciesUnit cella = 25.37 Å, b = 45.34 Å, c = 27.62 Å, β = 104.0 °a = 25.92 Å, b = 45.97 Å, c = 27.22 Å, β = 104.2 °Space groupP21P21Resolution1.5 Å1.8 ÅWater molecules7243Final R19.1%20.0%Number of reflections77515670Completeness96.5%97.5%The accession numbers are: His15 → Asp HPr, 1cm3, and the high pI species, 1cm2.

Formation of a succinimide or an isoimide have optimal main chain ψ angles and side chain χ1 dihedral angles: ψ = −120°, χ1 = +60°, and ψ = +60°, χ1 = +120°, respectively (20Clarke S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1987; 30: 808-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). For the residue 15 in His15 → Asp HPr, these angles are ψ = −170°, χ1 = +61°, which are considerably closer to the ideal values for succinimide formation. In addition to this structure, the high pI form, which contained the putative cyclized form, was crystallized, and diffraction data were collected within 10 days. The unit cell and refinement parameters are very similar to the normal His15 → Asp HPr (TableII). Only a well defined aspartyl residue was found at residue 15 (Fig. 6A) and in essentially the same position as in the normal His15 → Asp HPr (Fig. 6C).Table IIKinetic parameters of Asn 12 substitutions in HPrHPrEnzyme I KmEnzyme I VmaxRelativekcat/Kmμm%%Wild type6100100Asn12 → Ala125025Asn12 → AspaResult from Sharma et al.

To eliminate the potential involvement of Asn12 in the formation of the high pI form, the double mutant of HPr, His15 → Asp and Asn12 → Ala was made and purified. In wild type HPr, the Asn12 → Ala mutation causes a small impairment in the enzyme I reaction (Table II). In His15 → Asp HPr, the Asn12 → Ala mutation leads to no detectable change in the formation of P-Asp HPr or the high pI species, and the IEF gel is essentially the same as presented in Fig. 2. In order to follow more closely the events at position 15, the complications with respect to deamidation events at Asn12 and Asn38 were eliminated by creating the following two triple mutants Asn12 → Ala, His15 → Asp, and Asn38 → Ala, and Asn12 → Ala, His15 → Asn, and Asn38 → Ala. The events of either cyclization and/or deamidation were carried out at 60 °C and at pH 5.0, 7.0, 8.0, and 10.0 followed by separation of products on IEF gels as shown in Fig. 7. These gels show that there was no indication of either cyclization or deamidation even after 90 min at either pH 5.0 or pH 10.0, suggesting that the location at residue 15 has no unusual propensity to either cyclize or produce a succinimide specifically. Deamidation of Asn15 would have caused a band shift on the IEF gels, and none was observed even though the main chain ψ angle and side chain χ1 dihedral angle of Asp15 (and presumably Asn15) were near optimal for succinimide formation. The following mutants were made in wild type HPr: Asn12 → Ala, Asn12 → Ser, and Asn12 → Thr. Each was expressed and purified, and kinetic parameters for enzyme I were determined. The results are presented in Table II. The active site of HPr has two conserved residues, His15 and Arg17, and various investigations of the structure of HPr indicate that a residue with hydrogen bonding potential should be found at residue 12 in HPrs from several species (18Prasad L. Waygood E.B. Lee J.S. Delbaere L.T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 829-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Sharma S. Hammen P.K. Anderson J.W. Leung A. Georges F. Hengstenberg W. Klevit R.E.

Substitution of Asn12 in E. coli HPr by either serine or threonine has little effect on the phosphorylation of HPr by enzyme I. Serine is found in Bacillus subtilis HPr and threonine in Staphylococus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis HPrs. The removal of the hydrogen bonding potential by replacement with alanine results in only modest changes (Table II), very similar to that previously reported for Asn12 → Asp HPr. The approximately 4-fold change inkcat/Km will presumably affect the physiological efficiency of HPr, but the hydrogen bonding potential of residue 12 does not appear to be a major requirement for the mechanism of phosphoryl transfer. These modest changes in activity concur with the lack of direct evidence in NMR spectra for a hydrogen bond between His15 and residue 12 (45Kalbitzer H.R. Hengstenberg W. Eur. J.

In contrast to the flexibility of requirement at residue 12, it was expected that histidine would be an absolute requirement at residue 15. However, His15 → Asp can be phosphorylated, and donate phosphate to at least IIAglc but with much reduced efficiency. The aspartyl residue is a partial structural analogue of histidine as shown in Fig. 6; one of the carboxyl oxygen atoms is structurally equivalent to the Nδ1 atom in histidine. Phosphoryl transfer between P-histidines and acyl phosphates is well established. Acetate kinase, in which a γ-glutaminyl phosphate is formed (52Jones B.E. Rajagopal P. Klevit R.E. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2107-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), interacts with enzyme I to form a Nε2-P-histidine (53Fox D.K. Roseman S. J. Biol.

Reactions in chemotaxis involve transfers of phosphoryl groups between Nε2-P-histidine in CheA (41Hess J.F. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Nature. 1988; 336: 138-143Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and aspartyl phosphate in CheY (49Sanders D.A. Gillece-Castro B.L. Stock A.M. Burlingame A.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21770-21778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is an example of two component sensor systems. An interesting aspect of the aspartyl substitution of His15is that phosphorylation catalyzes formation of a cyclized compound. Cyclization reactions to form succinimides are established for both asparagine and aspartate, and the production of isoaspartyl from the hydrolysis of succinimides is established (20Clarke S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1987; 30: 808-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 21Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wright H.T.

Stability of Protein Pharmaceuticals: Chemical and Physical Pathways of Protein Degradation. Plenum Press, New York1992: 1-29Google Scholar). Although isoaspartyl formation is favored, constraints in a protein structure might cause the formation of only aspartyl or only isoaspartyl. It has been proposed (20Clarke S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1987; 30: 808-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 23Clarke S. Stephenson R.C. Lowenson J.D. Ahern T.J. Manning M.C. Stability of Protein Pharmaceuticals: Chemical and Physical Pathways of Protein Degradation. Plenum Press, New York1992: 1-29Google Scholar) that a second form of cyclization can occur to yield an isoimide (Fig. 1), and the subsequent hydrolysis of this yields only aspartyl residues. There is no indication that isoaspartyl acid is formed from the cyclization of Asp15, and the stimulation of cyclization by phosphorylation has been anticipated (23Clarke S. Stephenson R.C. Lowenson J.D. Ahern T.J. Manning M.C. Stability of Protein Pharmaceuticals: Chemical and Physical Pathways of Protein Degradation. Plenum Press, New York1992: 1-29Google Scholar). When either asparaginyl or aspartyl residues are at residue 15 in HPr, there is no indication of rapid cyclization in the absence of phosphorylation. This suggests that the phosphorylation of aspartate 15 is the pathway by which the cyclization to an isoimide is catalyzed. In wild type HPr, the phosphoryl group bound to the Nδ1atom of His15 has hydrogen-bonding interactions with the amide nitrogens of residues 16 and 17. As the one of the carboxyl oxygens of the aspartyl at residue 15 is an analogue of the Nδ1 atom, it is reasonable to assume that this is why phosphorylation occurs and that the same interactions between the phosphoryl group and the amide nitrogens of residues 16 and 17 occurs. This would mean that the phosphoryl group is hydrogen-bonded to the amide nitrogen of residue 16, which would be involved in succinimide formation. However, it is proposed that this interaction (Fig. 1C) leads to a concerted reaction, in which the phosphoryl group extracts the proton from the amide nitrogen of residue 16, with the consequence that the phosphoryl group is a better leaving group, and that the carbonyl of residue 16 is more reactive in attacking the carbonyl of residue 15 to form the isoimide. The complete lack of detection of significant amounts of isoaspartic acid and the ability to isolate a cyclic intermediate with 18 mass units less than His15 → Asp HPr are difficult to reconcile with the formation of a succinimide. It is suggested that the structure formed is an isoimide, which has not been found before in proteins.
