https://openalex.org/W2083453910,"Abstract A previously described two-dimensional electrophoresis procedure (O'Farrell, 1975) combined isoelectric focusing and sodium dodecylsulfate slab gel electrophoresis to give high resolution of proteins with isoelectric points in the range of pH 4–7. This paper describes an alternate procedure for the first dimension which, unlike isoelectric focusing, resolves basic as well as acidic proteins. This method, referred to as nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis (NEPHGE), involves a short time of electrophoresis toward the cathode and separates most proteins according to their isoelectric points. Ampholines of different pH ranges are used to optimize separation of proteins with different isoelectric points. The method is applied to the resolution of basic proteins with pH 7–10 Ampholines, and to the resolution of total cellular proteins with pH 3.5–10 Ampholines. Histones and ribosomal proteins can be readily resolved even though most have isoelectric points beyond the maximum pH attained in these gels. The separation obtained by NEPHGE with pH 3.5–10 Ampholines was compared to that obtained when isoelectric focusing was used in the first dimension. The protein spot size and resolution are similar (each method resolving more than 1000 proteins), but there is less resolution of acidic proteins in this NEPHGE gel due to compression of the pattern. On the other hand, NEPHGE gels extend the range of analysis to include the 15–30% of the proteins which are excluded from isoelectric focusing gels. The distribution of cell proteins according to isoelectric point and molecular weight for a procaryote (E. coli) was compared to that of a eucaryote (African green monkey kidney); the eucaryotic cell proteins are, on the average, larger and more basic."

https://openalex.org/W1992245932,"Abstract Changes in the rate of synthesis of rat hepatoma proteins in response to the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, have been measured by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (O'Farrell, 1975a). In the most extensively analyzed cell line (HTC cells), two classes of steroid-responsive gene products are found: seven Class I proteins, which are induced essentially every time they are detected on two-dimensional gel autoradiograms, and about sixteen Class II proteins, which are induced and/or repressed infrequently even though they are detected in almost every experiment. Contained in Class I is the steroid-inducible enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase as identified by its specific immunoprecipitation with antiTAT serum. Also in Class I are two series of proteins, termed Belts I and II, which are tentatively deduced to be sialoglycoproteins from their electrophoretic properties in this gel system. Belt I is localized on the HTC cell surface as shown by its labeling following radioiodination of whole cells. Class I polypeptides respond quite uniformly to dexamethasone in that they were induced with the same apparent kinetics and their induction ratios fell in the range of 3–10. The number of Class I proteins, Class II proteins behave as if their hormonal sensitivity varied between experiments. All proteins having decreased rates of synthesis after administration of dexamethasone fall into Class II. Their repression ratios are small, never exceeding 3, and only one (r 1 ) repressed with any consistency (9 of 16 experiments). In three experiments with another rat hepatoma line (FAZA cells), eight proteins were induced by the steroid and one repressed in all three experiments. Except for tyrosine aminotransferase, the inducible gene products from FAZA cells were electrophoretically different from the HTC set. Two of the inducible proteins in FAZA cells, however, were detectable in HTC cells: one was unaffected by dexamethasone in HTC cells and the other (r 1 ) repressed quite frequently. Thus inducibility of a gene product may be lost and even reversed in different hepatoma cell lines."

https://openalex.org/W2083456175,"Lipoprotein lipase activity is negligible in exponentially growing 3T3-L1 cells and 3T3-F442A cells, but develops in both lines when they reach a confluent state and undergo adipose conversion. 3T3-C2 cells, which undergo adipose conversion with extremely low frequency, do not develop the enzyme. The lipase activity of 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A is greatly enhanced by insulin and increases 80–180 fold during the adipose conversion. The lipase has the following characteristics in common with lipoprotein lipase from adipose and other tissues: it is dependent upon serum, is inhibited by 0.5–1.0 M sodium chloride, is recovered from acetone powders, has an alkaline pH optimum and is released from the cells by heparin. Like the lipoprotein lipase of tissue adipose cells, the enzyme of 3T3-L1 decays in the presence of cycloheximide with a half-time of about 25 min at 37°C. The ability of 3T3-F442A and 3T3-L1 to take up triglyceride from the medium depends almost completely upon lipoprotein lipase. They incorporate the fatty acids of a large fraction of a triglyceride emulsion added to the medium, and this utilization is stimulated by heparin. Very little of the glycerol portion of the triglyceride is incorporated. 3T3-C2, which lacks lipoprotein lipase, utilizes very little of either the fatty acid or the glycerol portion of triglyceride. The relevance of external lipid or lipoprotein to both the adipose conversion and the appearance of lipoprotein lipase was tested using confluent cultures in medium depleted of these components. In the presence of serum whose lipoproteins have been removed by flotation, lines 3T3-F442A and 3T3-L1 undergo adipose conversion as completely as in the presence of untreated serum, and lipoprotein lipase activity appears at essentially the same rate. In medium whose serum supplement has been extracted with acetone:ethanol, 3T3-F442A cells undergo adipose conversion to nearly the same extent as in untreated serum, and develop nearly the same increase in lipoprotein lipase activity. Unless even very low concentrations of lipids or lipoprotein are saturating it can be concluded that the adipose conversion does not depend upon external lipids or lipoproteins for its induction; rather the differentiation program is built into the cell type and comes into operation when growth is arrested even in their absence. The source of fatty acids utilized for triglyceride synthesis, however, may be affected by the amount of lipid provided to the cells."

https://openalex.org/W1520738155,"Calf liver contains two nuclear N-acetyltransferases which are separated by chromatography on hydroxylapatite. Both acetyltransferase A and acetyltransferase B will transfer acetate from acetyl-CoA to either histone or spermidine. The same protein catalyzes the reaction with both substrates; this is shown by a constant ratio of spermidine to histone activity over a 5,000-fold purification and identical heat denaturation kinetics for both spermidine and histone acetyltransferase activity with each enzyme. Histone is preferentially acetylated when both acceptors are present. Both enzymes preferentially acetylate polyamines (spermidine, spermine, and diaminodipropylamine) to diamines. Acetyltransferase A acetylates histones in the order: whole histone greater than H4 greater than H2A greater than H3 greater than H2B greater than H1; acetyltransferase B in the order: whole histone greater than H4 = H3 greater than H2A greater than H2B greater than H1. Michaelis constants are 2 X 10(-4)M for spermidine and 9 X 10(-6)M for acetyl-CoA. Acetyltransferase A has a molecular weight of 150,000; acetyltransferase B 175,000. Both enzymes are strongly inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate and weakly inhibited by EDTA."

https://openalex.org/W1511809726,"Protein phosphorylation activates tyrosine hydroxylase in crude extracts of rat striatum, hypothalamus, and adrenal glands by a reduction in the apparent Km value for 6-methyltetrahydropterin. Removal of endogenous catecholamines by gel filtration or cation exchange results in a similar activation. Phosphorylation causes only a small additional reduction in the apparent Km for reduced pterin in striatal extracts from which catecholamines have been removed. Kinetic analysis indicates that protein phosphorylation causes a significant increase in the Ki for end product dopamine, whereas gel filtration or cation exchange treatment has little effect on the dopamine Ki value. None of the above treatments appears to change the molecular weight of the enzyme. At physiological concentrations of dopamine, the increase in Ki by phosphorylation would effectively release tyrosine hydroxylase from end product feedback inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W1511733089,"Tyrosine aminotransferase mRNA was quantitated by translation in a cell-free system derived from wheat germ followed by specific immunoprecipitation of the newly synthesized enzyme subunit. Hepatic poly(A)-containg RNA prepared from rats treated for 4 h with N6, O2'-dibutyryl cyclic AMP and theophylline was approximately 5.6 times more active in directing the synthesis of the tyrosine aminotransferase subunit relative to untreated controls. The overall template activity of the RNA prepared from control and cyclic AMP-treated animals was virtually identical, demonstrating that the cyclic nucleotide effect was specific for the tyrosine aminotransferase mRNA. At all times, after a single injection of dibutyryl cyclic AMP and theophylline, the increase in hepatic enzyme activity was accompanied by corresponding induction in the level of functional tyrosine aminotransferase mRNA. Other inducers of tyrosine aminotransferase, such as glucagon and hydrocortisone, also increased the level of tyrosine aminotransferase mRNA in proportion to their effect on enzyme activity. The RNA polymerase II inhibitor, alpha-amanitin, completely blocked the dibutyryl cyclic AMP-mediated increase in tyrosine aminotransferase mRNA activity. These studies demonstrate that, in intact animals, the induction of tyrosine aminotransferase activity by dibutyryl cyclic AMP can be completely accounted for by a corresponding increase in the level of functional mRNA coding for the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1491984372,"The administration of N6,O2-dibutyryl cyclic AMP and theophylline to adrenalectomized rats results in an increase in the amount of functional mRNA coding for tyrosine aminotransferase that can be isolated from liver. The induction of this specific mRNA, as quantitated in a mRNA-dependent reticulocyte lysate system, and using poly(A)+ mRNA extracted from total tissue and polysomes, is very rapid. Within an hour after the intraperitoneal injection of the cyclic AMP derivative there is a 5- to 7-fold elevation of functional mRNA coding for tyrosine aminotransferase (mRNATAT), and by 3 h this has returned to basal levels. In contrast, the 4- to 5-fold induction of tyrosine aminotransferase catalytic activity is maximal at 2 h and is still significantly greater than the basal level at 5 h. In the basal state, tyrosine aminotransferase mRNA codes for 0.019 +/- 0.003% of the protein synthesized in the in vitro system, whereas after cyclic nucleotide treatment this value 0.115 +/- 0.015%, hence the increase in mRNATAT activity is relatively specific. Cordycepin, at a concentration which prevents the accumulation in cytoplasm of poly(A)+ mRNA, completely blocks the increase in both the catalytic and mRNA activity of this enzyme. The marked increase in functional mRNA, the requirement for continued synthesis of poly(A)+ RNA, and the rapid induction and deinduction suggest that the cyclic nucleotide is enhancing specific mRNA synthesis and/or, processing, however an effect on mRNA degradation cannot be excluded."

https://openalex.org/W1531251848,"The secondary and tertiary structure of human plasma thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) was investigated by circular dichroism and fluorescence properties. The relaxation time of TBG indicated that it is a compact, symmetric molecule. It was calculated from the far ultraviolet CD spectrum that about one-half of the peptide groups are equally distributed in alpha helical and beta structures. In the near ultraviolet, the CD spectrum of TBG was modified when thyroxine was bound. TBG was stable at temperatures below 50 degrees at pH 9 and below 35 degrees at pH 10.5. Below pH 5 tryptophanyl fluorescence revealed a molecular transition which followed first order kinetics. The transition resulted in an irreversible loss of binding of the hormone. Acidification to pH 3.4 produced only a minor change in the CD spectrum, in which some of the alpha helical peptides were converted to beta structure."

https://openalex.org/W1634339644,"The spin-labeled anion N-[4-(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl)] oxamate has been synthesized and characterized. In the presence of this compound, a specific iron-transferrin-anion complex is formed, as evidenced by the development of a characteristic red color. No EPR signal was observed for the nitroxyl radical in the protein complex, presumably due to broadening of the signal by the paramagnetic metal ion. Failure to observe a signal implies that the metal to nitroxyl distance is less than or equal to 6 A. This suggests that the anion is directly attached to the metal ion in the protein. The pH dependence of iron dissociation from iron-transferrin-oxalate is also reported. This complex is more stable at low pH than iron-transferrin-carbonate."

In a poor nitrogen source such as glutamate, the specific activity of the enzyme is higher than that found in good nitrogen sources such as ammonium or glutamine. These differences in specific enzyme activity correspond to differences in enzyme concentration. The relative rates of glutamine synthetase synthesis and degradation were measured in exponential cultures grown in different nitrogen sources. The differences in enzyme concentration are explained by differences in the relative rate of enzyme synthesis."

Activity-pH curves identified 2 active site residues with pK values at pH 5.7 and pH 9.1 in the presence of magnesium and at pH 5.7 and pH 7.5 in the presence of manganese or cobalt. Saturation velocity kinetics enabled the identification of two distinct divalent cation binding sites. The first, nonspecific site has a K0.5 of 2 to 7 x 10(-5) M, depending on the cation and the pH. The second site, which is specific for magnesium, binds this cation in a negatively cooperative fashion. The affinity at pH 8.1 varies approximately 100-fold from the first magnesium bound to the fourth. The negative cooperativity is greatest at high pH. Because the pH range of activity is very broad, both the phosphate monoanion and dianion of P-glycolate must be bound as the substrate. The concentration of these two species at the apparent Km is independent of magnesium concentration. The P-glycolate.magnesium complex is kinetically inactive."
https://openalex.org/W1505992054,"Hybrid-heme hemoglobins, alpha(meso)2beta(proto)2 and alpha(proto)2beta(meso)2, were prepared, and the O2 equilibria of their alpha and beta chains were measured separately at the isosbestic points of the partner chains at different pH values and in the presence and absence of inositol hexaphosphate. The Adair equation was extended to distinguish between the O2 saturations of the alpha and beta chains, and the seven equilibrium parameters were obtained by curve fitting to those equations. The results showed that the beta chains have an affinity slightly higher than the alpha chains in the binding of the first O2 molecule. For the second O2 molecule, the molecular species that has been oxygenated on the alpha chain has a higher affinity than that carrying O2 on the beta chain. The slopes of the Hill plots were higher for the alpha chain. The O2 saturation curves for the alpha and beta chains were calculated from the parameters averaged for the hybrids alpha(meso)2beta(proto)2 and alpha(proto)2beta(meso)2 in order to cancel the effects of the heme replacement. The curves showed that the difference in O2 saturation between the two kinds of chains depends on the conditions and on the degree of O2 saturation. It was concluded that the functional difference between the chains is small enough so that it is not required to modify the models already accepted for the cooperativity of hemoglobin."

The valence-hybrid thus formed was reacted with oxygen and with carbon monoxide. Kinetics of the reactions were studied. The effects of pH, inositol hexaphosphate, and temperature on these reactions were examined. The kinetics of the ligation of O2 and CO were used to characterize the affinity states of the valence-hybrid and its parent methemoglobin. Our results support the description of stripped methemoglobin A as residing in an R state. In the presence of inositol hexaphosphate methemoglobin is stabilized in a T state, but it switches into a high affinity state when the pH is raised a0ove 8.0. This structural transition was not found to coincide with the switch of spin state of the heme-iron that accompanies the ionization of water in aquomethemoglobin A."
