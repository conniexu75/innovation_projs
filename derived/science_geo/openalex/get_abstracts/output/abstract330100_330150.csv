https://openalex.org/W2032647857,"Replicator neural networks self-organize by using their inputs as desired outputs; they internally form a compressed representation for the input data. A theorem shows that a class of replicator networks can, through the minimization of mean squared reconstruction error (for instance, by training on raw data examples), carry out optimal data compression for arbitrary data vector sources. Data manifolds, a new general model of data sources, are then introduced and a second theorem shows that, in a practically important limiting case, optimal-compression replicator networks operate by creating an essentially unique natural coordinate system for the manifold."

Cellular inhomogeneities give rise to global anisotropy in wave propagation, with specific local patterns resulting in hexagonal, diamond, and pentagonal geometries. Spiral wave sources appear spontaneously and serve as organizing centers of the surrounding wave activity. The experimental methodology offers flexibility for studies of excitable media with made-to-order spatial inhomogeneities."

Muller, in the issue of 17 June, page 837, the word not was inadvertently omitted. The sentence should have read: ""This is why the group of responsible scientists who signed the official report on these investigations in Japan (4) stated that it had ;always been doubtful whether significant findings' could be obtained by the methods there used and pointed out that the inconclusive results, although not definitely positive, were at the same time ;entirely consistent with what is known of the radiation genetics of a wide variety of [other] material.'
