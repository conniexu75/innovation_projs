https://openalex.org/W2092328174,"Evidence accumulates that the transcription factor nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) has an essential role in cancer development and chemoresistance, thus pointing to its potential as an anticancer target and undermining its suitability in chemoprevention. Through the induction of cytoprotective and proteasomal genes, Nrf2 confers apoptosis protection in tumor cells, and inhibiting Nrf2 would therefore be an efficient strategy in anticancer therapy. In the present study, pancreatic carcinoma cell lines (Panc1, Colo357 and MiaPaca2) and H6c7 pancreatic duct cells were analyzed for the Nrf2-inhibitory effect of the coffee alkaloid trigonelline (trig), as well as for its impact on Nrf2-dependent proteasome activity and resistance to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and anticancer drug-induced apoptosis. Chemoresistant Panc1 and Colo357 cells exhibit high constitutive Nrf2 activity, whereas chemosensitive MiaPaca2 and H6c7 cells display little basal but strong tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ)-inducible Nrf2 activity and drug resistance. Trig efficiently decreased basal and tBHQ-induced Nrf2 activity in all cell lines, an effect relying on a reduced nuclear accumulation of the Nrf2 protein. Along with Nrf2 inhibition, trig blocked the Nrf2-dependent expression of proteasomal genes (for example, s5a/psmd4 and α5/psma5) and reduced proteasome activity in all cell lines tested. These blocking effects were absent after treatment with Nrf2 siRNA, a condition in which proteasomal gene expression and proteasome activity were already decreased, whereas siRNA against the related transcription factor Nrf1 did not affect proteasome activity and the inhibitory effect of trig. Depending on both Nrf2 and proteasomal gene expression, the sensitivity of all cell lines to anticancer drugs and TRAIL-induced apoptosis was enhanced by trig. Moreover, greater antitumor responses toward anticancer drug treatment were observed in tumor-bearing mice when receiving trig. In conclusion, representing an efficient Nrf2 inhibitor capable of blocking Nrf2-dependent proteasome activity and thereby apoptosis protection in pancreatic cancer cells, trig might be beneficial in improving anticancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1989991871,"Tauopathies are a class of neurodegenerative diseases marked by intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated Tau. These diseases may occur by sporadic mechanisms in which genetic variants represent risk factors for disease, as is the case in Alzheimer disease (AD). In AD, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of soluble Tau/pTau-181 are higher in cases compared with controls. A subset of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases occur by a familial mechanism in which MAPT, the gene that encodes Tau, mutations are dominantly inherited. In symptomatic FTD patients expressing a MAPT mutation, CSF Tau levels are slightly elevated but are significantly lower than in AD patients. We sought to model CSF Tau changes by measuring extracellular Tau in cultured cells. Full-length, monomeric extracellular total Tau and pTau-181 were detectable in human neuroblastoma cells expressing endogenous Tau, in human non-neuronal cells overexpressing wild-type Tau, and in mouse cortical neurons. Tau isoforms influence the rate of Tau release, whereby the N terminus (exons 2/3) and microtubule binding repeat length contribute to Tau release from the cell. Compared with cells overexpressing wild-type Tau, cells overexpressing FTD-associated MAPT mutations produce significantly less extracellular total Tau without altering intracellular total Tau levels. This study demonstrates that cells actively release Tau in the absence of disease or toxicity, and Tau release is modified by changes in the Tau protein that are associated with tauopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2014629469,"Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental program, which can be adopted by cancer cells to increase their migration and ability to form metastases. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is a well-studied inducer of EMT. We demonstrate that TGFβ potently stimulates hyaluronan synthesis via upregulation of hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) in NMuMG mammary epithelial cells. This stimulatory effect requires the kinase active type I TGFβ receptor and is dependent on Smad signaling and activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Knockdown of HAS2 inhibited the TGFβ-induced EMT by about 50%, as determined by the phase contrast microscopy and immunostaining using the EMT marker ZO-1. Furthermore, real-time PCR analysis of the EMT markers fibronectin, Snail1 and Zeb1 revealed decreased expressions upon HAS2 suppression, using specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) for HAS2. Removal of the extracellular hyaluronan by Streptomyces hyaluronidase or inhibiting the binding to its cell surface receptor CD44 by blocking antibodies, did not inhibit TGFβ-induced EMT. Interestingly, HAS2 suppression completely abolished the TGFβ-induced cell migration, whereas CD44 knockdown did not. These observations suggest that TGFβ-dependent HAS2 expression, but not extracellular hyaluronan, has an important regulatory role in TGFβ-induced EMT."

The mRNA binding step is modulated by signaling through a protein kinase known as the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). mTORC1 directly phosphorylates the translational repressors eIF4E binding proteins (4E-BP) 1 and 2, releasing them from the mRNA cap binding protein eIF4E, thereby promoting assembly of the eIF4E·eIF4G complex. mTORC1 also phosphorylates the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1), which subsequently phosphorylates eIF4B, and programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), which sequesters eIF4A from the eIF4E·eIF4G complex, resulting in repressed translation of mRNAs with highly structured 5′-untranslated regions. In the present study, we compared the role of the 4E-BPs in the regulation of global rates of protein synthesis to that of eIF4B and PDCD4. We found that maintenance of eIF4E interaction with eIF4G was not by itself sufficient to sustain global rates of protein synthesis in the absence of mTORC1 signaling to p70S6K1; phosphorylation of both eIF4B and PDCD4 was additionally required. We also found that the interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G was maintained in the liver of fasted rats as well as in serum-deprived mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking both 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2, suggesting that the interaction of eIF4G with eIF4E is controlled primarily through the 4E-BPs. Modulation of mRNA binding to the 40 S ribosomal subunit during translation initiation controls not only global rates of protein synthesis but also regulates the pattern of protein expression by allowing for selective inclusion, or exclusion, of mRNAs encoding particular proteins from polysomes. The mRNA binding step is modulated by signaling through a protein kinase known as the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). mTORC1 directly phosphorylates the translational repressors eIF4E binding proteins (4E-BP) 1 and 2, releasing them from the mRNA cap binding protein eIF4E, thereby promoting assembly of the eIF4E·eIF4G complex. mTORC1 also phosphorylates the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1), which subsequently phosphorylates eIF4B, and programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), which sequesters eIF4A from the eIF4E·eIF4G complex, resulting in repressed translation of mRNAs with highly structured 5′-untranslated regions.

Global rates of protein synthesis in the liver are suppressed following an overnight fast but recover rapidly upon feeding (1.Yoshizawa F. Kimball S.R. Vary T.C. Jefferson L.S.

The feeding-induced stimulation of hepatic protein synthesis is in large part due to activation of signaling through the serine/threonine protein kinase known as the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR; 2The abbreviations used are: mTORmechanistic target of rapamycin4E-BPeukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding proteinsMEFmouse embryo fibroblast(s)DKOdouble knock-outeEF2eukaryotic elongation factor 2IGFinsulin-like growth factor. previously known as the mammalian target of rapamycin) (2.Laplante M.

The polypeptide mTOR functions in two distinct multiprotein complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) (3.Jacinto E. Loewith R. Schmidt A. Lin S. Rüegg M.A. Hall A. Hall M.N. Mammalian TOR complex 2 controls the actin cytoskeleton and is rapamycin insensitive.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). Both complexes contain mTOR, mLST8, DEPTOR, and the Tti1/Tel2 complex; however, mTORC1 contains the raptor (regulatory-associated protein of mTOR) and PRAS40 (proline-rich Akt substrate 40 kDa), whereas mTORC2 contains rictor (raptor-independent companion of mTOR), mSin1, and protor1/2 (3.Jacinto E. Loewith R. Schmidt A. Lin S. Rüegg M.A. Hall A. Hall M.N. Mammalian TOR complex 2 controls the actin cytoskeleton and is rapamycin insensitive.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). mTORC1 regulates cell growth and proliferation by integrating signals from nutrients and mitogens to acutely stimulate protein synthesis through multiple mechanisms, including phosphorylation and activation of several downstream proteins involved in the mRNA binding step in translation initiation. During this step, the 43 S pre-initiation complex, consisting of the 40 S ribosomal subunit, the eIF2·GTP·initiator methionyl-tRNA complex, and eIF3, is recruited to the m7GTP cap at the 5′-end of mRNA and scans for an AUG start codon that is in the proper context (4.Pestova T.V.

The role of mTORC1 in regulating global rates of protein synthesis is critical, as Torin1 and PP242, potent inhibitors of mTOR, significantly impair protein synthesis in both proliferating wild-type and rictor−/− cells (5.Thoreen C.C.

The best characterized substrates for mTORC1 are the ribosomal protein S6 kinases S6K1 and S6K2 and the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs). The 4E-BPs bind to the mRNA m7GTP cap binding protein eIF4E and prevent it from interacting with the scaffolding protein eIF4G. Phosphorylation of the 4E-BPs by mTORC1 releases them from eIF4E, allowing eIF4E to interact with eIF4G. The interaction promotes the binding of the mRNA to the 43 S preinitiation complex through the association of the mRNA·eIF4E·eIF4G complex with eIF3 that is part of the preinitiation complex. Thus, in part, the binding of the mRNA to the 43 S preinitiation complex is controlled through mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of the 4E-BPs, although other mechanisms, e.g. phosphorylation of eIF4E and/or eIF4G, have also been described (7.Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donzé O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N.

Once the 40 S ribosome is located at the m7GTP cap at the 5′-end of the mRNA, the next step involves scanning of the 40 S ribosomal subunit along the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) until an AUG start codon in the proper context is located. During scanning, secondary structure is unwound by the RNA helicase, eIF4A. The helicase activity of eIF4A is stimulated by eIF4B, allowing the unwinding of longer, more stable secondary structures. The interaction of both eIF4A and eIF4B with eIF4G is regulated by the S6 kinases. Thus, the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase p70S6K1 phosphorylates PDCD4 (programmed cell death protein 4), releasing it from eIF4A, allowing eIF4A to interact with the C terminus of eIF4G (10.Yang H.S.

Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). p70S6K1 also phosphorylates eIF4B, promoting its interaction with eIF4G and eIF4A (11.Holz M.K. Ballif B.A. Gygi S.P.

The vast majority of studies assessing mTORC1-mediated stimulation of mRNA translation have focused on phosphorylation of the 4E-BPs and the interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G as a mechanism for regulating the mRNA binding step in initiation. However, a recent study (12.Huang B.P. Wang Y. Wang X. Wang Z. Proud C.G. Blocking eukaryotic initiation factor 4F complex formation does not inhibit the mTORC1-dependent activation of protein synthesis in cardiomyocytes.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2009; 296: H505-H514Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) suggests that the decrease in protein synthesis associated with mTORC1 inhibition cannot be attributed solely to a reduction in the interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G and that other processes not identified in the study are additionally required. In the present study, we confirmed the results of the previous study (12.Huang B.P. Wang Y. Wang X. Wang Z. Proud C.G. Blocking eukaryotic initiation factor 4F complex formation does not inhibit the mTORC1-dependent activation of protein synthesis in cardiomyocytes.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2009; 296: H505-H514Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) to show that the interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G was not sufficient to stimulate mRNA translation in either the liver of fasted mice or in serum-deprived mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) in culture. We extend the earlier study to show that activation of p70S6K1 and subsequent phosphorylation of eIF4B and PDCD4 act in concert with eIF4E·eIF4G complex assembly in mTORC1-mediated stimulation of mRNA translation. We also demonstrated that the primary mechanism for regulating the interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G involves 4E-BP1 and -BP2. Overall, the results are consistent with a model in which multiple inputs downstream of mTORC1 are required to optimally stimulate protein synthesis. Protease Inhibitor Mixture was purchased from Sigma and ECL Western blotting detection reagent from Pierce. Preparation of the 4E-BP1 and eIF4E antibodies has been described previously (13.Kimball S.R. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S.

Anti-S6K1, and goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were purchased from Bethyl Laboratories. Anti-GAPDH antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, whereas all other antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Protein content was measured by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Eif4ebp1;Eif4ebp2 mice bearing disruptions in the genes encoding both 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 were a kind gift from Dr. Nahum Sonenberg (McGill University). Male mice weighing ∼30 g were maintained on a 12:12-h light:dark cycle with food (Harlan Teklad), and water was provided ad libitum. Mice were fasted for 10 h, and some of the mice were then allowed free access to food for 45 min where indicated. All procedures involving the mice were approved by the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For the analysis of protein phosphorylation state, a portion (∼0.3 g) of liver was homogenized in 7 volumes of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm benzamidine, 50 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm microcystin, and 10 μl/ml Sigma protease inhibitor mixture) using a Polytron homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described previously (15.Kimball S.R. Siegfried B.A. Jefferson L.S. Glucagon represses signaling through the mammalian target of rapamycin in rat liver by activating AMP-activated protein kinase.J. Biol.

Phosphorylation of eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4B, S6K1, and PDCD4 was measured in the supernatant fraction using phospho-specific antibodies. Cultures of wild-type and Eif4ebp1;Eif4ebp2 double knock-out (DKO) MEF, a kind gift from Dr. Nahum Sonenberg (McGill University), were maintained in Dulbeco's modified Eagle's medium lacking sodium pyruvate and containing high glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlas) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transfections were performed using Xtremegene HP (Roche Applied Science) with a 3:1 ratio of reagent to DNA (μl:μg) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were deprived of serum for 3 h and treated with IGF (insulin-like growth factor) 1 (10 ng/ml) as indicated. Cells were harvested in cell lysis buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. To evaluate the rate of protein synthesis, cells were treated as described above. After 5 min of treatment with IGF1, cells were radiolabeled with 50 μCi of 35S-labeled EasyTag Express Protein Labeling Mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 15 min at 30 °C. Labeled cells were washed 3× with PBS and harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% deoxycholate. Lysates were rocked at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min. Global rates of protein synthesis were calculated by the incorporation of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine into TCA-precipitable protein as described previously (16.Tuckow A.P. Jefferson S.J.

HA-tagged constitutively active S6K1 expression plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. John Blenis (Harvard Medical School) and has been described previously (17.Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Identification of a conserved motif required for mTOR signaling.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Constitutively active HA-tagged eIF4B was generated through mutation of Ser-422 to Asp using a previously described plasmid (18.Raught B. Peiretti F. Gingras A.C. Livingstone M. Shahbazian D.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange Lightning (Agilent Technologies) and the following primers to mutate Ser-422 to Asp: 5′-GGAACGGTCGAGGACAGGAGATGAGTCATCACAAACTG-3′ and 5′-CAGTTTGTGATGACTCATCTCCTGTCCTCGACCGTTCC-3′. The product was then cloned into pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) with an N-terminal HA-tag using HindIII and NotI and the following primers: 5′-AGCTAAGCTTACCATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTATGGCGGCCTCAGCAAA-3′ and 5′-GAAGATTATGCCGATTAAGCGGCCGCAGCT-3′. The plasmid was then sequenced to confirm the mutation. For siRNA studies, the following complementary RNAs were transfected using DharmaFECT (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol to knock down PDCD4 expression: 5′-CCTATATCGATAGTTACAAAGGAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTCCTTTGTAACTATCGATATAGGTA-3′. Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating 1,000 × g supernatant fractions of liver homogenates or cell lysates with monoclonal anti-human eIF4E or eIF4G antibody. Homogenate or lysate fractions containing ∼1 mg of protein were incubated with 15 μg of antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. For each immunoprecipitation reaction, 200 μg of anti-mouse IgG beads (Qiagen) previously blocked with lysis buffer containing 1% BSA was added to each sample, and the suspension was rocked at 4 °C for 1 h. For eIF4E immunoprecipitation, beads were washed 3× with 1 ml of cold lysis buffer. For eIF4G, immunoprecipitation beads were washed 3× with PBS. After washing, beads were suspended in 1× SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Supernatant fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies to 4E-BP1, 4E-BP2, eIF4E, eIF4G, or PDCD4, and the results were normalized for the amount of the target protein in the immunoprecipitate. The data are expressed as means ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance and Student's t test were used to compare differences among groups. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Three mechanisms have been proposed to regulate the interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G: the reversible interaction of eIF4E with the eIF4E binding proteins (7.Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donzé O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Insulin-dependent stimulation of protein synthesis by phosphorylation of a regulator of 5′-cap function.Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of eIF4E on Ser-209 (8.Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingam M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Phosphorylation of the cap-binding protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E by protein kinase Mnk1 in vivo.Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of eIF4G on multiple residues including Ser-1108 (9.Raught B. Gingras A.C. Gygi S.P. Imataka H. Morino S. Gradi A. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Serum-stimulated, rapamycin-sensitive phosphorylation sites in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4GI.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). To examine the relative contribution of each of these mechanisms to regulation of the eIF4E·eIF4G interaction, mice containing disruptions in the genes encoding 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 were fasted overnight and then refed in the morning to activate mTORC1 and promote changes in phosphorylation of the 4E-BPs, eIF4E and eIF4G. eIF4E was then immunoprecipitated from liver supernatants and the presence of eIF4G was assessed in the immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig. 1A, the amount of eIF4G bound to eIF4E was low in the livers of fasted, wild-type mice, and re-feeding resulted in a 2-fold elevation in eIF4G bound to eIF4E. To confirm the feeding-induced elevation in the interaction of the two proteins, eIF4G was instead immunoprecipitated from liver supernatant fractions and assessed for eIF4E present in the immunoprecipitate. In agreement with the results of the eIF4E immunoprecipitation, refeeding significantly elevated the interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G (Fig. 1B). The enhanced interaction of the two proteins was associated with a reduction in the interaction of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 1C) and 4E-BP2 (Fig. 1D) with eIF4E as well as enhanced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 1E) and eIF4G (Fig. 1F), concomitant with a reduction in phosphorylation of eIF4E on Ser-209 (Fig. 1G). Interestingly, the amount of eIF4G in the eIF4E immunoprecipitate was the same in livers from fasted DKO mice as in fed wild-type or DKO mice, but significantly greater compared with fasted wild-type mice (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the amount of eIF4E in the eIF4G immunoprecipitate was the same in fasted DKO mice as in fasted wild-type or refed DKO mice but greater than in fasted wild-type mice (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the magnitude of the feeding-induced changes in eIF4E and eIF4G phosphorylation was similar in wild-type and DKO mice. Thus, in mouse liver, the interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G is regulated primarily through the interaction of eIF4E with 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2. In addition to promoting phosphorylation of 4E-BPs, activation of mTORC1 also leads to enhanced phosphorylation of p70S6K1. In the present study, hyperphosphorylation of p70S6K1 was enhanced in the liver of both wild-type and DKO mice in response to refeeding (Fig. 2A). The enhanced phosphorylation of p70S6K1 in the liver of DKO compared with wild-type mice was likely due to the absence of 4E-BP1/2, as mTORC1 substrates have been previously observed to compete for phosphorylation (17.Schalm S.S.

In response to refeeding, phosphorylation of eIF4B on Ser-422 was enhanced by 176% in the liver of wild-type mice (Fig. 2B), and a similar response was observed in the liver of DKO mice. Furthermore, the feeding-induced stimulation of PDCD4 phosphorylation on Ser-67 was elevated to a similar extent in the liver of wild-type (69%) and DKO mice (54%) (Fig. 2C) compared with fasted mice, whereas PDCD4 expression was reduced by 31 and 33%, respectively (Fig. 2D). The feeding-induced reduction in PDCD4 expression was mirrored by a fall in the amount of the protein detected in eIF4G immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2E). Phosphorylation of eEF2 kinase on Ser-336 by p70S6K1 results in inhibition of eEF2 kinase activity and consequently repressed phosphorylation of eEF2 on Thr-56 (21.Wang X. Li W. Williams M. Terada N.

However, in the present study, phosphorylation of eEF2 on Thr-56 did not change in the liver of either wild-type or DKO mice upon feeding (Fig. 2F). To evaluate the role of 4E-BP1/2 in regulating global rates of protein synthesis, the incorporation of 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine into cellular protein was measured in wild-type and 4E-BP1/2 DKO MEF following serum deprivation and upon stimulation of serum-deprived cells with IGF1. Protein synthesis is stimulated by IGF1 through binding to the type 1 IGF receptor, which promotes its interaction with the p85α subunit of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and in turn activates Akt (22.Luo J. Field S.J. Lee J.Y. Engelman J.A. Cantley L.C. The p85 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase down-regulates IRS-1 signaling via the formation of a sequestration complex.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Akt directly phosphorylates at least two proteins responsible for the regulation of mTORC1 signaling: tuberous sclerosis complex 2 and the 40-kDa proline-rich Akt substrate. The IGF1 receptor also activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK1 and ERK2, leading to phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 and raptor (23.Carriere A. Romeo Y. Acosta-Jaquez H.A. Moreau J. Bonneil E. Thibault P. Fingar D.C. Roux P.P. ERK1/2 phosphorylate Raptor to promote Ras-dependent activation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1).J. Biol.

Together, activation of the Akt and ERK signaling pathways results in a potent up-regulation of mTORC1 signaling (25.Winter J.N. Jefferson L.S. Kimball S.R.

IGF1 enhanced the rate of protein synthesis in wild-type MEF by 76% (Fig. 3A) such that there was no difference in the rate of protein synthesis in wild-type and DKO MEF. When wild-type MEF were deprived of serum, a substantial amount of 4E-BP1 was observed to interact with eIF4E, whereas eIF4G could not be detected (Fig. 3B). Upon stimulation with IGF1, the interaction of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E was reduced, and the interaction with eIF4G was enhanced. Similar to the observations in the liver of fasted DKO mice, eIF4G interacted readily with eIF4E in serum-deprived DKO MEF, and no further enhancement was observed with IGF1 treatment (Fig. 3B), despite elevated eIF4G phosphorylation on Ser-1108 and reduced eIF4E phosphorylation on Ser-209 in both wild-type and DKO MEF (Fig. 3C). Thus, protein synthesis is repressed by serum deprivation in MEF lacking 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2, even though the interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G is preserved. This finding suggests that the interaction of eIF4G with eIF4E is not by itself sufficient to maintain protein synthesis in serum-deprived MEF and that activation of another step in mRNA translation is required for full maintenance. One potential explanation for the decreased rate of protein synthesis in serum-starved DKO MEF is repression of signaling pathways downstream of p70S6K1. In this regard, in serum-deprived wild-type and DKO MEF phosphorylation of p70S6K1 on Thr-389 was low (Fig. 3C), and IGF1 treatment robustly stimulated phosphorylation in both cell types. Moreover, in both wild-type and DKO MEF, phosphorylation of the p70S6K1 substrates eIF4B on Ser-422 and PDCD4 on Ser-67 was up-regulated in IGF1-treated compared with serum-deprived cells (Fig. 3C). To evaluate the role of p70S6K1 in stimulating protein synthesis, we transiently overexpressed constitutively active p70S6K1 (CA-S6K1) in wild-type and DKO MEF. In both wild-type and DKO MEF, overexpression of CA-S6K1 enhanced the phosphorylation of eIF4B on Ser-422 following serum-deprivation (Fig. 4A). This effect was particularly pronounced in serum-starved wild-type MEF, where CA-S6K1 enhanced eIF4B phosphorylation by 151% (Fig. 4B). Overexpression of CA-S6K1 enhanced phosphorylation of eIF4B by 80% in serum-deprived DKO MEF, such that it was no longer different from eIF4B phosphorylation observed in IGF1-treated wild-type MEF (Fig. 4B). Notably, CA-S6K1 did not enhance the level of eIF4B phosphorylation in either wild-type or DKO MEF treated with IGF1, suggesting that IGF1 might promote eIF4B phosphorylation through activation of p70S6K1. Overexpression of CA-S6K1 also reduced the expression of PDCD4 in both wild-type and DKO MEF (Fig. 4C). In response to IGF1 treatment, phosp"

Nevertheless, few treatments exist that are designed to specifically inhibit processes that drive tumor metastasis. The imprinted DLK1-DIO3 region contains tumor-suppressing miRNAs, but their identity and function remain indeterminate. In this study we identify seven miRNAs in the imprinted DLK1-DIO3 region that function cooperatively to repress the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a critical step that drives tumor metastasis, as well as proliferation of carcinoma cells. These seven miRNAs (miRs 300, 382, 494, 495, 539, 543, and 544) repress a signaling network comprising TWIST1, BMI1, ZEB1/2, and miR-200 family miRNAs and silencing of the cluster, which occurs via hypermethylation of upstream CpG islands in human ductal carcinomas, confers morphological, molecular, and function changes consistent with an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-544 independently inhibited proliferation of numerous tumor cell lines by inducing the ATM cell cycle checkpoint pathway. These results establish the DLKI-DIO3 miRNA cluster as a critical checkpoint regulating tumor growth and metastasis and implicate epigenetic modification of the cluster in driving tumor progression. These results also suggest that promoter methylation status and miRNA expression levels represent new diagnostic tools and therapeutic targets to predict and inhibit, respectively, tumor metastasis in carcinoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W2002781581,"Retinoic acid (RA) regulates gene transcription by activating the nuclear receptors retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) β/δ and their respective cognate lipid-binding proteins CRABP-II and FABP5. RA induces neuronal differentiation, but the contributions of the two transcriptional pathways of the hormone to the process are unknown. Here, we show that the RA-induced commitment of P19 stem cells to neuronal progenitors is mediated by the CRABP-II/RAR path and that the FABP5/PPARβ/δ path can inhibit the process through induction of the RAR repressors SIRT1 and Ajuba. In contrast with its inhibitory activity in the early steps of neurogenesis, the FABP5/PPARβ/δ path promotes differentiation of neuronal progenitors to mature neurons, an activity mediated in part by the PPARβ/δ target gene PDK1. Hence, RA-induced neuronal differentiation is mediated through RAR in the early stages and through PPARβ/δ in the late stages of the process. The switch in RA signaling is accomplished by a transient up-regulation of RARβ concomitantly with a transient increase in the CRABP-II/FABP5 ratio at early stages of differentiation. In accordance with these conclusions, hippocampi of FABP5-null mice display excess accumulation of neuronal progenitor cells and a deficit in mature neurons versus wild-type animals."
https://openalex.org/W1963634341,"FOXM1 is implicated in genotoxic drug resistance but its role and mechanism of action remain unclear. Here, we establish that γH2AX foci, indicative of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), accumulate in a time-dependent manner in the drug-sensitive MCF-7 cells but not in the resistant counterparts in response to epirubicin. We find that FOXM1 expression is associated with epirubicin sensitivity and DSB repair. Ectopic expression of FOXM1 can increase cell viability and abrogate DSBs sustained by MCF-7 cells following epirubicin, owing to an enhancement in repair efficiency. Conversely, alkaline comet and γH2AX foci formation assays show that Foxm1-null cells are hypersensitive to DNA damage, epirubicin and γ-irradiation. Furthermore, we find that FOXM1 is required for DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR) but not non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), using HeLa cell lines harbouring an integrated direct repeat green fluorescent protein reporter for DSB repair. We also identify BRIP1 as a direct transcription target of FOXM1 by promoter analysis and chromatin-immunoprecipitation assay. In agreement, depletion of FOXM1 expression by small interfering RNA downregulates BRIP1 expression at the protein and mRNA levels in MCF-7 and the epirubicin-resistant MCF-7 EpiR cells. Remarkably, the requirement for FOXM1 for DSB repair can be circumvented by reintroduction of BRIP1, suggesting that BRIP1 is an important target of FOXM1 in DSB repair. Indeed, like FOXM1, BRIP1 is needed for HR. These data suggest that FOXM1 regulates BRIP1 expression to modulate epirubicin-induced DNA damage repair and drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2044176668,"Resveratrol is a phytoalexin and natural phenol that is present at relatively high concentrations in peanuts and red grapes and wine. Based upon studies of yeast and invertebrate models, it has been proposed that ingestion of resveratrol may also have anti-aging actions in mammals including humans. It has been suggested that resveratrol exerts its beneficial effects on health by activating the same cellular signaling pathways that are activated by dietary energy restriction (DR). Some studies have reported therapeutic actions of resveratrol in animal models of metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the effects of resveratrol on cell, tissue and organ function in healthy subjects are largely unknown. In the present study, we evaluated the potential effects of resveratrol on the proliferation and survival of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in culture, and in the hippocampus of healthy young adult mice. Resveratrol reduced the proliferation of cultured mouse multi-potent NPCs, and activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), in a concentration-dependent manner. Administration of resveratrol to mice (1-10 mg/kg) resulted in activation of AMPK, and reduced the proliferation and survival of NPCs in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Resveratrol down-regulated the levels of the phosphorylated form of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. Finally, resveratrol-treated mice exhibited deficits in hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory. Our findings suggest that resveratrol, unlike DR, adversely affects hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive function by a mechanism involving activation of AMPK and suppression of CREB and BDNF signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2007662761,"Chronic infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major risk factor for the onset and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), although the underlying mechanisms are unclear. The c-Myc oncogene contributes to the genesis of many types of cancers, including HCC, partly via the induction of genetic damage and the inhibition of the cellular response to genotoxic stress. Here, we show a previously undiscovered mechanistic link between HCV infection and enhanced c-Myc expression. c-Myc expression was augmented in non-tumoral liver tissues from HCV-infected individuals with or without HCC and in hepatocyte cell lines harboring an HCV replicon and the infectious HCV strain JFH1. Increased c-Myc expression was confirmed in vivo in a transgenic murine model expressing the entire HCV open reading frame, demonstrating a direct role for HCV protein expression in c-Myc induction. Mechanistically, activation of Akt by the HCV non-structural protein NS5A, and the subsequent stabilization of the transcription factor β-catenin, was demonstrated to be responsible for activation of the c-Myc promoter, and for increased c-Myc transcription. β-Catenin-dependent c-Myc expression in this context led to increased production of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial perturbation, enhanced DNA damage and aberrant cell-cycle arrest. Together, these data provide a novel insight into the mechanisms involved in HCV-associated HCCs, strongly suggesting that c-Myc has a crucial contributory role in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2076271925,"αvβ6 integrin expression is upregulated on a wide range of epithelial tumours, and is thought to play a role in modulating tumour growth. Here we describe a human therapeutic antibody 264RAD, which binds and inhibits αvβ6 integrin function. 264RAD cross-reacts with human, mouse and cynomolgus monkey αvβ6, and inhibits binding to all ligands including the latency-associated peptide of TGF-β. Screening across a range of integrins revealed that 264RAD also binds and inhibits the related integrin αvβ8, but not the integrins α5β1, αvβ3, αvβ5 and α4β1. In vitro 264RAD inhibited invasion of VB6 and Detroit 562 cells in a Matrigel invasion assay and αvβ6 mediated production of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in Calu-3 cells. It inhibited TGF-β-mediated activation of dermal skin fibroblasts by preventing local activation of TGF-β by NCI-H358 tumour cells in a tumour cell-fibroblast co-culture assay. In vivo 264RAD showed dose-dependent inhibition of Detroit 562 tumour growth, regressing established tumours when dosed at 20 mg/kg once weekly. The reduction in growth associated with 264RAD was related to a dose-dependent inhibition of Ki67 and phospho-ERK and a reduction of αvβ6 expression in the tumour cells, coupled to a reduction in fibronectin and alpha smooth muscle actin expression in stromal fibroblasts. 264RAD also reduced the growth and metastasis of orthotopic 4T1 tumours. At 20 mg/kg growth of both the primary tumour and the number of metastatic deposits in lung were reduced. The data support the conclusion that 264RAD is a potent inhibitor of αvβ6 integrin, with some activity against αvβ8 integrin, that reduces both tumour growth and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2086695084,"Notch signaling is a highly conserved cell-cell communication pathway regulating normal development and tissue homeostasis. Aberrant Notch signaling represents an important oncogenic mechanism for T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), an aggressive subset of the most common malignant childhood cancer ALL. Therefore, understanding the molecular regulation of Notch signaling is critical to identify new approaches to block aberrant Notch oncogenic activity. The family of three MAML transcriptional coactivators is crucial for Notch signaling activation. The prototypic member MAML1 is the major coactivator that regulates Notch oncogenic activities in leukemic cells. However, the molecular basis underlying MAML1 coactivator function that contributes to Notch signaling remains unclear. In this study, we performed proteomic studies and identified DDX5, an ATP-dependent DEAD-box RNA helicase, as a component of the MAML1 protein complex. DDX5 interacts with MAML1 in vitro and in vivo, and is associated with the endogenous NOTCH1 transcription activation complex in human T-ALL leukemic cells. Lentivirus-mediated short-hairpin RNA knock-down of DDX5 resulted in decreased expression of Notch target genes, reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in cultured human leukemic cells with constitutive activation of Notch signaling. Also, DDX5 depletion inhibited the growth of human leukemia xenograft in nude mice. Moreover, DDX5 is highly expressed in primary human T-ALL leukemic cells based on the analyses of Oncomine and GEO databases, and Immunohistochemical staining. Our overall findings revealed a critical role of DDX5 in promoting efficient Notch-mediated transcription in leukemic cells, suggesting that DDX5 might be critical for NOTCH1-mediated T-ALL pathogenesis and thus is a potential new target for modulating the Notch signaling in leukemia."

This multidomain protein contains a prosegment, a catalytic domain, a hinge region, and a cysteine-histidine rich domain (CHRD) composed of three tightly packed modules named M1, M2, and M3. The CHRD is required for the activity of PCSK9, but the mechanism behind this remains obscure. To define the contribution of each module to the function of PCSK9, we dissected the CHRD structure. Six PCSK9 deletants were generated by mutagenesis, corresponding to the deletion of only one (ΔM1, ΔM2, ΔM3) or two (ΔM12, ΔM13, ΔM23) modules. Transfection of HEK293 cells showed that all deletants were well processed and expressed compared with the parent PCSK9 but that only those lacking the M2 module were secreted. HepG2 cells lacking endogenous PCSK9 (HepG2/shPCSK9) were used for the functional analysis of the extracellular or intracellular activity of PCSK9 and its deletants. To analyze the ability of the deletants to enhance the LDLR degradation by the intracellular pathway, cellular expressions revealed that only the ΔM2 deletant retains a comparable total LDLR-degrading activity to full-length PCSK9. To probe the extracellular pathway, HepG2/shPCSK9 cells were incubated with conditioned media from transfected HEK293 or HepG2/shPCSK9 cells, and cell surface LDLR levels were analyzed by FACS.

https://openalex.org/W2110934763,"Orai1 is a plasma membrane protein that in its tetrameric form is responsible for calcium influx from the extracellular environment into the cytosol in response to interaction with the Ca(2+)-depletion sensor STIM1. This is followed by a fast Ca(2+)·calmodulin (CaM)-dependent inhibition, resulting from CaM binding to an Orai1 region called the calmodulin binding domain (CMBD). The interaction between Orai1 and CaM at the atomic level remains unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of a CaM·Orai1-CMBD complex showing one CMBD bound to the C-terminal lobe of CaM, differing from other CaM-target protein complexes, in which both N- and C-terminal lobes of CaM (CaM-N and CaM-C) are involved in target binding. Orai1-CMBD binds CaM-C mainly through hydrophobic interactions, primarily involving residue Trp(76) of Orai1-CMBD, which interacts with the hydrophobic pocket of CaM-C. However, NMR data, isothermal titration calorimetry data, and pulldown assays indicated that CaM-N and CaM-C both can bind Orai1-CMBD, with CaM-N having ∼4 times weaker affinity than CaM-C. Pulldown assays of a Orai1-CMBD(W76E) mutant, gel filtration chromatography data, and NOE signals indicated that CaM-N and CaM-C can each bind one Orai1-CMBD. Thus our studies support an unusual, extended 1:2 binding mode of CaM to Orai1-CMBDs, and quantify the affinity of Orai1 for CaM. We propose a two-step mechanism for CaM-dependent Orai1 inactivation initiated by binding of the C-lobe of CaM to the CMBD of one Orai1 followed by the binding of the N-lobe of CaM to the CMBD of a neighboring Orai1."
https://openalex.org/W2094173258,"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies due to its aggressive growth and rapid development of distant metastases. In this context, mucin 1 (MUC1) overexpression and hypoxia are frequently observed events. However, their functional relationship remains largely unknown. This study provides evidence that MUC1 is overexpressed by hypoxia and contributes to hypoxia-driven angiogenesis. Using the conditioned medium obtained from hypoxia-stressed AsPC1 cells treated with MUC1 siRNAs, we demonstrated that MUC1 enhanced the endothelial tube formation, proliferation and migration ability, which induced by hypoxia-conditioned medium (HCM). In addition, MUC1 was significantly induced by hypoxia, especially in the pancreatic cancer cells derived from metastatic tumors (AsPC1, HPAF2 or Capan1), and MUC1-cytoplasmic tail (MUC1-CT) accumulated in the nucleus under hypoxia. As noted in a previous report, MUC1-CT was recruited to genomic regions upstream of the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) accompanied with β-catenin and p53, resulting in the hypoxic induction of CTGF. Moreover, hypoxia-induced MUC1 partially regulated two other hypoxia-inducible proangiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor-A and platelet-derived growth factor-B. The neutralization assay revealed that endothelial tube formation induced by HCM was clearly suppressed by antibodies against these three factors, suggesting the importance of these factors in hypoxia-driven angiogenesis. In summary, this is the first report demonstrating a pivotal role of MUC1 in controlling the hypoxia-driven angiogenesis through the regulation of multiple proangiogenic factors in pancreatic cancer.

We found that complex formation between sortilin and p75NTR relies on contact points in the extracellular domains of the receptors. We also determined that the interaction critically depends on an extracellular juxtamembrane 23-amino acid sequence of p75NTR. Functional studies further revealed an important regulatory function of the sortilin intracellular domain in p75NTR-regulated intramembrane proteolysis and apoptosis. Thus, although the intracellular domain of sortilin does not contribute to p75NTR binding, it does regulate the rates of p75NTR cleavage, which is required to mediate pro-neurotrophin-stimulated cell death.

Binding of proNTs is achieved by binding of the pro-domain by sortilin, whereas p75NTR interacts with the mature part of the neurotrophin (5.Nykjaer A. Lee R. Teng K.K. Jansen P. Madsen P.

Extracellularly, sortilin contains a ligand-binding 10-bladed β-propeller followed by a 10CC module (12.Quistgaard E.M. Madsen P. Grøftehauge M.K. Nissen P. Petersen C.M. Thirup S.S. Ligands bind to sortilin in the tunnel of a ten-bladed β-propeller domain.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A short cytoplasmic tail contains several internalization and sorting motifs, which facilitate the trafficking and sorting functions of sortilin (13.Nielsen M.S. Madsen P. Christensen E.I. Nykjaer A.

Barde Y.A. The neurotrophin receptor p75NTR. Novel functions and implications for diseases of the nervous system.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1131-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Its extracellular domain consists of four tandemly arranged ligand-binding domains followed by a ∼60-amino acid juxtamembrane stalk region. As for other members of the TNF receptor superfamily, a death domain is found in the cytoplasmic domain linked to the transmembrane sequence via a 60-amino acid p75NTR-specific “chopper” module (15.Coulson E.J.

The p75NTR intracellular domain (ICD) has been reported to promote apoptosis, as well as cell survival in a cell type-specific manner if released into the cytosol (16.Kenchappa R.S. Zampieri N.

Trk-dependent ADAM17 activation facilitates neurotrophin survival signaling.FASEB J. 2011; 25: 2061-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This is achieved by regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) whereby the stalk region of p75NTR is first cleaved by the α-secretase TACE/ADAM17, generating the C-terminal fragment. The remaining membrane-tethered stub is subsequently cleaved by presenilin-dependent γ-secretase, releasing the p75NTR ICD to the cytosol for signaling (20.Skeldal S. Matusica D. Nykjaer A. Coulson E.J. Proteolytic processing of the p75 neurotrophin receptor. A prerequisite for signalling? Neuronal life, growth and death signalling are crucially regulated by intra-membrane proteolysis and trafficking of p75NTR.Bioessays. 2011; 33: 614-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that sortilin increases p75NTR affinity for proNTs. For example, cells expressing p75NTR alone bind proNGF with an approximate Kd value of ∼15 nm, whereas co-expression of sortilin increases affinity for proNGF ∼100-fold to Kd = ∼160 pm (5.Nykjaer A. Lee R. Teng K.K. Jansen P. Madsen P. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Kliemannel M. Schwarz E. Willnow T.E. Hempstead B.L. Petersen C.M. Sortilin is essential for proNGF-induced neuronal cell death.Nature. 2004; 427: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). This dramatically decreases the effective concentration of proNTs required for apoptotic signaling by p75NTR. Here we identify the extracellular domains in sortilin and p75NTR that are responsible for receptor heterodimerization. Although the intracellular domain of sortilin is not involved in receptor interactions, we found that it regulates RIP of p75NTR and proNT-stimulated apoptotic signaling, suggesting additional roles for sortilin in p75NTR-mediated apoptosis.

For construction of sortilinecd-IL2Rtm,icd, a fragment was amplified by standard PCR techniques using the α-subunit of the human interleukin-2 receptor (IL2R)/pcDNA3.1/Zeo(−) as the template and an upstream primer encoding part of the transmembrane domain of IL2R and part of the luminal domain of sortilin, and a downstream primer containing a cytosolic sequence of IL2R. Using the native luminal BspEI site of sortilin and a 3′ primer-generated AflII site, the fragment was ligated into predigested sortilinmut/pcDNA3.1/Zeo(−). PCR-mediated overlap extension was used to fuse the extracellular and transmembrane domains of sortilin and HA-tagged p75NTR with the β-galactosidase Δα and Δω, respectively, generating sortilin-β-galΔα and HA-p75NTR-β-galΔω. An upstream fragment encoding part of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of sortilin in combination with part of β-galactosidase Δα was amplified using sortilinmut/pcDNA 3.1/Zeo(−) as the template. A downstream fragment encoding β-galactosidaseΔα was amplified using the template Δα/pwzl/Neo (23.Mohler W.A. Blau H.M. Gene expression and cell fusion analyzed by lacZ complementation in mammalian cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 12423-12427Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The upstream fragment containing HA-p75NTR extracellular and transmembrane domains and part of β-galactosidase Δω was generated using HA-p75NTR/pcDNA3.1/G418 as the template. A downstream fragment encoding β-galactosidase Δω was amplified using Δω/pwzl/Hygro (23.Mohler W.A. Blau H.M. Gene expression and cell fusion analyzed by lacZ complementation in mammalian cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 12423-12427Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) as the template. Following amplification of overlapping PCR products, sortilin fusion protein was inserted into sortilinmut/pcDNA3.1/Zeo(−) using the native luminal BspEI site and the 3′ primer-generated AflII site, whereas HA-p75NTR fusion protein was ligated into predigested pcDNA 3.1/G418(−) using a primer-generated 5′-NotI and the 3′ AflII sites.

Palstra N. Abankwa D. Hill J.M. Skeldal S. Matusica D. Venkatraman P. Hancock J.F. Coulson E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2012; (October 26, 10.1074/jbc.M112.382903)Google Scholar), a modified pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) backbone was used. The rat p75NTR signal peptide including a Kozak sequence (nucleotides −29 to +87) was inserted between the KpnI and EcoRV restriction sites, generating the vector pCDNA3-SP. p75NTR coding sequences were amplified under standard PCR conditions and cloned into pCDNA3-SP using the primer-generated EcoRV and NheI sites. In cases where p75NTR variants were fused to a fluorophore, YFP and CFP were amplified by PCR from peYFP-N1 and peCFP-N1 (Clontech), using primers incorporating 5′ EcoRV and NheI restriction sites and a 3′ stop codon and a HindIII site. Enhanced YFP and CFP were cloned in frame between the EcoRV and HindIII restriction sites of pCDNA3-SP, generating the vectors pCDNA3-YFP/CFP. p75NTR coding sequences were amplified by PCR with a 5′ EcoRV and a 3′ NheI restriction site. p75NTR coding sequences were then cloned between the EcoRV and NheI restriction sites of pCDNA3-YFP/CFP to generate in-frame fusion proteins. p75NTRtm,icd (251–425) was constructed as previously described (24.Jung K.M.

To generate sortilin-YFP, full-length human sortilin, including the sequences encoding the signal and pro-peptides, and the Kozak sequence were amplified by PCR, thereby generating a 3′-Kpn site and a 5′-Nhe site. The fragment was inserted into pCDNA3-YFP. The p75NTR-Gal4 reporter construct for the p75NTR cleavage reporter assay was cloned by inserting rat p75NTR cDNA into the pcDNA3-GVP vector containing Gal4 DNA binding and VP16 transcription activating domains and a neomycin selection cassette. The plasmid was digested with MunI, and a Gal4-responsive 9×UAS Luc2P cassette from the pGL4.35 reporter vector (Promega) was inserted by blunt end cloning after filling in the recessed 3′ ends with Klenow fragment. HEK293 cells and rat Schwannoma cells (RN22 cells) were cultured in DMEM (Lonza) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transfections were carried out with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), and stably transfected clones were selected in medium containing 150 (HEK293 cells) or 300 (RN22 cells) μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) and/or 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Anti-neurotensin receptor-3, recognizing the extracellular domain of sortilin, was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (612100) and anti-p75NTR antibody (ab10494) from Abcam. Anti-p75NTR ICD 9992, for detecting p75NTR ICD, was a generous gift from Professor Moses V. Chao (Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine, New York University School of Medicine). Anti-IL2Rα (I6152) and anti-HA tag (H6908) antibodies were from Sigma. Anti-GFP (11814460001) was purchased from Roche Applied Science.

Recombinant mouse proNGF used for RN22 cell death assays was purchased from Chemicon. Mouse NGF was from Austral Biologicals (GF-022) and neurotensin from Sigma (N6383). Stably or transiently transfected HEK293 cells were incubated with or without ligand in PBS (with 1 mm CaCl2 and MgCl2) for 90 min at room temperature and then treated with the reducible protein cross-linker dithiobis succinimidylpropionate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washing, the cells were lysed on ice for 10 min in TNE buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 10 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40 and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Samples were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C by use of Gammabind G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with anti-p75NTR (10494) or anti-GFP antibodies. Nonspecific binding was removed by washing beads five times in TBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20, and the proteins were eluted by boiling samples in reducing sample buffer (20 mm dithioerythritol, 2.5% SDS). Protein samples were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and visualization using the Fuji film LAS1000 imaging system. The blots were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS for 30 min at 50 °C under rotation. Co-immunoprecipitation performed with p75NTR variants was visualized with the Odyssey infrared imaging system. HEK293 cells were seeded into white 96-well tissue culture plates with clear bottoms (Sigma) at a density of 30,000 cells/well. The cells were then transfected with sortilin-β-galΔα and/or HA-p75NTR-β-galΔω and after 48 h incubated with or without proNTs for 30 min at 37 °C. β-galactosidase activity was assessed by adding 100 μl of Gal-Screen substrate (50 μl of both solution A and solution B) (Applied Biosystems) to each well. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and luminescence was measured with a Victor3 1420 multilabel counter. Analyses were performed on a Biacore 3000 instrument equipped with CM5 sensor chips and activated as previously described (22.Munck Petersen C. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Tauris J. Jacobsen L.

Injection of proteins was done in running buffer at 25 °C (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.005% P20). Binding was expressed in relative response units as the response obtained from the flow cell containing immobilized receptor minus the response obtained when using an activated and blocked but uncoupled flow cell. The FRET of p75NTR molecules within a population of HEK293 cells was determined 48 h post-transfection of triplicate wells of transiently transfected cells and untransfected cells (to determine background fluorescence). The cells were washed once in PBS, pH 7.4, harvested in PBS, and centrifuged for 30 s at 10,000 × g. Cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of PBS and loaded into 96-well black microtiter plates (Greiner) for immediate analysis. Fluorescence was recorded simultaneously for the donor fluorophore at 430 ± 10 nm/480 ± 10 nm and the acceptor fluorophore at 485 nm/530 ± 10 nm, and FRET was measured at 430 ± 10 nm/530 ± 10 nm on a POLARstar OPTIMA multidetection microplate reader (BMG Labtech). FRET was calculated on cells as a FRET ratio, which is the fractional increase in YFP emission caused by FRET (26.Meyer B.H. Segura J.M. Martinez K.L. Hovius R. George N. Johnsson K. Vogel H.

https://openalex.org/W1970856104,"β-Site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) is a membrane-tethered member of the aspartyl proteases that has been identified as β-secretase. BACE1 is targeted through the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane and then is internalized to endosomes. Sorting of membrane proteins to the endosomes and lysosomes is regulated by the interaction of signals present in their carboxyl-terminal fragment with specific trafficking molecules. The BACE1 carboxyl-terminal fragment contains a di-leucine sorting signal ((495)DDISLL(500)) and a ubiquitination site at Lys-501. Here, we report that lack of ubiquitination at Lys-501 (BACE1K501R) does not affect the rate of endocytosis but produces BACE1 stabilization and accumulation of BACE1 in early and late endosomes/lysosomes as well as at the cell membrane. In contrast, the disruption of the di-leucine motif (BACE1LLAA) greatly impairs BACE1 endocytosis and produces a delayed retrograde transport of BACE1 to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and a delayed delivery of BACE1 to the lysosomes, thus decreasing its degradation. Moreover, the combination of the lack of ubiquitination at Lys-501 and the disruption of the di-leucine motif (BACE1LLAA/KR) produces additive effects on BACE1 stabilization and defective internalization. Finally, BACE1LLAA/KR accumulates in the TGN, while its levels are decreased in EEA1-positive compartments indicating that both ubiquitination at Lys-501 and the di-leucine motif are necessary for the trafficking of BACE1 from the TGN to early endosomes. Our studies have elucidated a differential role for the di-leucine motif and ubiquitination at Lys-501 in BACE1 endocytosis, trafficking, and degradation and suggest the involvement of multiple adaptor molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2074051247,"Protein kinases play key roles in regulating human cell biology, but manifold substrates and functions make it difficult to understand mechanism. We tested whether we could dissect functions of a pleiotropic mitotic kinase, Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), via distinct thresholds of kinase activity. We accomplished this by titrating Plk1 activity in RPE1 human epithelial cells using chemical genetics and verifying results in additional lines. We found that distinct activity thresholds are required for known functions of Plk1 including (from low to high activity) bipolar spindle formation, timely mitotic entry, and formation of a cytokinesis cleavage furrow. Subtle losses in Plk1 activity impaired chromosome congression and produced severe anaphase dysfunction characterized by poor separation of chromosome masses. These two phenotypes were separable, suggesting that they stem from distinct phosphorylation events. Impaired chromosome segregation in anaphase was the most sensitive to modest loss in Plk1 activity. Mechanistically, it was associated with unpaired sister chromatids with stretched kinetochores, suggestive of merotelic attachments. The C-terminal Polo box domain of Plk1 was required for its anaphase function, although it was dispensable for forming a bipolar spindle. The ultimate effect of partial inhibition of Plk1 was the formation of micronuclei, an increase in tetraploid progeny, and senescence. These results demonstrate that different thresholds of Plk1 activity can elicit distinct phenotypes, illustrating a general method for separating pleiotropic functions of a protein kinase even when these are executed close in time."
https://openalex.org/W2002642171,"The glycosphingolipid biosynthesis is initiated by monoglycosylation of ceramides, the action of which is catalyzed either by UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase or by UDP-galactose:ceramide galactosyltransferase (CGalT). CGalT is expressed predominantly at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of oligodendrocytes and is responsible for synthesizing galactosylceramides (GalCer) that play an important role in regulation of axon conductance. However, despite the importance of ceramide monoglycosylation enzymes in a spectrum of cellular functions, the mechanism that fine tunes activities of those enzymes is largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that the sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) chaperone, the mammalian homologue of a yeast C8-C7 sterol isomerase, controls the protein level and activity of the CGalT enzyme via a distinct ER-associated degradation system involving Insig. The Sig-1R forms a complex with Insig via its transmembrane domain partly in a sterol-dependent manner and associates with CGalT at the ER. The knockdown of Sig-1Rs dramatically prolonged the lifetime of CGalT without affecting the trimming of N-linked oligosaccharides at CGalT. The increased lifetime leads to the up-regulation of CGalT protein as well as elevated enzymatic activity in CHO cells stably expressing CGalT. Knockdown of Sig-1Rs also decreased CGalT degradation endogenously expressed in D6P2T-schwannoma cells. Our data suggest that Sig-1Rs negatively regulate the activity of GalCer synthesis under physiological conditions by enhancing the degradation of CGalT through regulation of the dynamics of Insig in the lipid-activated ER-associated degradation system. The GalCer synthesis may thus be influenced by sterols at the ER.

https://openalex.org/W2053449864,"Blockage of the metastasis process remains a significant clinical challenge, requiring innovative therapeutic approaches. For this purpose, molecules that inhibit matrix metalloproteinases activity or induce the expression of their natural inhibitor, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), are potentially interesting. In a previous study, we have shown that synthetic ligands binding to cell surface nucleolin/nucleophosmin and known as HB 19 for the lead compound and NucAnt 6L (N6L) for the most potent analog, inhibit both tumor growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, they prevent metastasis in a RET transgenic mice model which develops melanoma. Here, we investigated the effect of N6L on the invasion capacity of MDA-MB-435 melanoma cells. Our results show that the multivalent pseudopeptide N6L inhibited Matrigel invasion of MDA-MB-435 cells in a modified Boyden chamber model. This was associated with an increase in TIMP-3 in the cell culture medium without a change in TIMP-3 mRNA expression suggesting its release from cell surface and/or extracellular matrix. This may be explained by our demonstrated N6L interaction with sulfated glycosaminoglycans and consequently the controlled bioavailability of glycosaminoglycan-bound TIMP-3. The implication of TIMP-3 in N6L-induced inhibition of cell invasion was evidenced by siRNA silencing experiments showing that the loss of TIMP-3 expression abrogated the effect of N6L. The inhibition of tumor cell invasion by N6L demonstrated in this study, in addition to its previously established inhibitory effect on tumor growth and angiogenesis, suggests that N6L represents a promising anticancer drug candidate warranting further investigation.

In the different processes of tumor progression, including tumor growth, angiogenesis, and invasion, proteolysis of extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixA488Alexa Fluor 488BtnbiotinGAGglycosaminoglycanMMPmatrix metalloproteinaseN6LNucAnt 6LTACETNFα-converting enzymeTIMPtissue inhibitor of metalloproteinasesTNFR1TNF receptor 1. is an essential step (1.Sahai E. Illuminating the metastatic process.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Among the enzymes involved in ECM degradation, the most studied is the family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) which contains at least 25 members of metzincin endopeptidases. These enzymes are able to degrade ECM components as well as nonmatrix proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, receptors, antimicrobial peptides, and more (2.Parks W.C. Wilson C.L. Lopez-Boado Y.S.

Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which include four members noted TIMP-1 to -4, are natural inhibitors of MMPs.

HB-19 is the prototype of a multivalent pseudopeptides family which was shown to target a nucleoprotein complex at the surface of tumor cells and to induce apoptosis. A more potent HB-19 analog, called NucAnt 6L (N6L), was described more recently. These synthetic peptides were shown to bind two major nucleoproteins, nucleolin and nucleophosmin. Treatment of athymic mice bearing tumor cell xenografts with NucAnt peptides led to tumor growth inhibition by inducing apoptosis of tumor cells and by inhibiting angiogenesis (24.Destouches D.

Human melanoma MDA-MB-435 cell line was purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). Cells were routinely cultured in DMEM 4.5 g/liter of glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) and grown at 37 °C under 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. MDA-MB-435 invasion assays were performed using 24-well chemotaxis chambers (Transwell, 8 μm, Corning Costar). Transwells were coated with 20 μg of MatrigelTM (BD Biosciences). DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS was placed in the lower chamber as chemoattractant, and 1.5 × 105 cells were seeded in the upper compartment in the presence or not of 10 μm N6L or HB-19. Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, after which noninvading cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed by wiping with a cotton tip. Cells were then stained with May-Grünwald/Giemsa solution. Pictures of invading cells were taken in three random fields per well (objective ×10). Cell counting was performed by image analysis using an original program, built with the ImageJ software as described in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. MDA-MB-435 cells (2 × 105) were seeded in 12-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and incubated 24 h for adhesion. After two washes with PBS, media were replaced by free FBS DMEM, and cells were treated or not for 48 h at 37 °C with 10 μm N6L or HB-19. Conditioned media were harvested, and cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% protease inhibitor mixture set V (Calbiochem)). Protein concentrations were assessed using the BCA kit (PIERCE) and were used to normalize the samples of conditioned media in the zymography and Western blot analyses (10 μl of culture media loaded corresponding to 2 μg of cell proteins). Conditioned media and protein lysates from MDA-MB-435 cells were analyzed for gelatin degradation by electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing denatured type I collagen (1 mg/ml). For reverse zymography, active MMP-2 (20 ng/ml) was also added to the polyacrylamide gel as described previously (27.Huet E. Brassart B. Cauchard J.H. Debelle L. Birembaut P. Wallach J. Emonard H.

Metastasis. 2002; 19: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Protein samples were separated on a SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and then transferred onto a 0.45-μm Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) using standard protocols. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk, 0.1% Tween 20, TBS, pH 7.4, blocking buffer and incubated with TIMP-3 antibody (mouse monoclonal, clone 136-13H4, Millipore, 1:200), TNFR1 antibody (mouse monoclonal, clone 16805, R&D Systems, 1:250) or GAPDH antibody (mouse monoclonal, clone 6C5, Abcam, 1:100,000) before incubation with secondary anti-mouse antibody (peroxidase-conjugated donkey, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 1:10,000). Immunocomplexes were visualized by using the luminescence blotting substrate POD kit (Roche Applied Science) and then by exposure to autoradiography film. MDA-MB-435 cells were seeded and treated in the same conditions as for the zymographic and Western blot analysis. After 1, 6, or 18 h of treatment, cells were washed twice with cold PBS, and RNA was extracted using a TRIzol Reagent kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 0.5 μg of total RNA using random hexamer primers and the Superscript IITM reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). 2 μl (1/10) of the reaction products were then submitted to PCR amplification in a final volume of 50 μl. Primers for TIMP-3 detection were: 5′-AGG CAG CAA GCA GAT AGA CT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCA GGG AGA GGA AAG ACA TT-3′ (reverse) and 5′-AGT GAA GAA CAG TCC AGA CTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCA GGA AAT AAC TCG GCT CAT-3′ (reverse) for TFIID detection. Conditioned media (1:20 volume) were mixed with 200 pm recombinant MMP-2 (Calbiochem), in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij35 buffer. 10 μm fluorogenic peptidic substrate Mca-PLGL-Dpa-AR-NH2 (R&D Systems) was added, and fluorescence was measured using a fluorescence plate reader (Labsystems Fluoroskan II; Thermo Fisher Scientific). MDA-MB-435 cells (5 × 105) were seeded on cover glass in 6-well plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C for adhesion. Cells were washed with PBS, treated or not with 10 μm N6L or HB-19 in FBS-free medium for 48 h at 37 °C. Cells were fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature and saturated with 3% goat serum, PBS for 1 h at room temperature. TIMP-3 was detected using the same antibody used for Western blotting (1:100) and secondary antibody anti-mouse coupled with Alexa Fluor 568 (goat IgG, A11031, Molecular Probes, 1:200). Nuclei were labeled with 1 μg/ml DAPI (Roche Applied Science). MDA-MB-435 cells seeded as for TIMP-3 labeling were washed with PBS and pretreated or not for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.1 unit/ml heparitinase I, II, III (Sigma), 0.1 units/ml chondroitinase A, B, C (Sigma) in incubation buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm NaCl). Non-pretreated cells were only incubated with incubation buffer. Cells were labeled with 0.5 μm N6L-A488 for 30 min at 37 °C, washed twice with PBS, and then fixed with methanol for 2 min at room temperature. Nuclei were labeled with 1 μg/ml DAPI (Roche Applied Science). Heparin (Sigma) was covalently bound to BSA as described previously (28.Soulié P. Héroult M. Bernard I. Kerros M.E. Milhiet P.E. Delbé J. Barritault D. Caruelle D. Courty J. Immunoassay for measuring the heparin-binding growth factors HARP and MK in biological fluids.J. Immunoassay Immunochem. 2002; 23: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with heparin-BSA complex (2.5 μg/ml). Wells were saturated 1 h at room temperature with 3% BSA in PBS. Ligands (biotinylated N6L (N6L-Btn) with or not competitors, or recombinant TIMP-3 (Abcam, ab39317) diluted with 1% BSA in PBS, were added to wells and incubated overnight at 4 °C. For competition with TIMP-3 binding, N6L was added for 2 h at 37 °C. N6L-Btn was revealed using anti-biotin antibody coupled to peroxidase (goat antibody, A4541, Sigma, 1:2,000) for 2 h at room temperature. TIMP-3 was revealed using the Millipore antibody for 2 h at 37 °C and secondary anti-mouse antibody (peroxidase-conjugated donkey, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 1:10,000) for 1 h at 37 °C. Peroxidase activity was detected using TMB Substrate Kit (Pierce). Binding experiments were performed as described previously (25.Destouches D. Page N. Hamma-Kourbali Y. Machi V. Chaloin O.

MDA-MB-435 (1 × 105) cells were treated as described for N6L-A488 labeling without methanol fixation and then detached with 2 mm EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence was analyzed by FACS (MACS Quant, Miltenyi Biotech). Validated small interfering sequences of TIMP-3 5′-AGC UGG AGG UCA ACA AGU Att-3′ (Ambion) and 5′-GGC UAC GUC CAG GAG CGC ACC tt-3′ sequence of GFP (MWG) were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Statistical significance was determined by ANOVA unpaired t test using the Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Each experiment was performed at least three times. We first evaluated the effect of N6L on Matrigel invasion by the MDA-MB-435 cells. Cells were seeded in FBS-free media in the upper chambers in the presence or not of either N6L or HB-19 which is another member of the family of multivalent pseudopeptide known to display a lower inhibitory effect than N6L on tumor growth. A N6L concentration of 10 μm was chosen because it does not display activity on MDA-MB-435 cell growth at the conditions used (25.Destouches D. Page N. Hamma-Kourbali Y. Machi V. Chaloin O.

FBS 5% was used as chemoattractant in the lower chamber. N6L significantly inhibited cell invasion (39 ± 2.5% inhibition) and that, to a greater extent than with HB-19 (29 ± 3% inhibition) (Fig. 1, A and B). The effect of N6L on the expression of MMP-2 and -9 and their natural inhibitors TIMPs was then investigated. For this purpose, cells were treated for 48 h at 37 °C in the presence or not of 10 μm N6L or HB-19. The expression of MMPs and TIMPs in the conditioned media was evaluated respectively by gelatin zymography and reverse gelatin zymography. Inhibition of MMP-2 and -9 was induced by treatment with 10 μm N6L which was not observed with HB-19 used at the same concentration (Fig. 1C). Reverse zymography showed that N6L treatment did not cause a noticeable variation of TIMP-2 levels (28 kDa), but caused some inhibition of TIMP-1 (22 kDa). Importantly, a band corresponding to the molecular mass of TIMP-3 (24 kDa) was strongly increased with N6L treatment (Fig. 1D). A similar but smaller effect was observed with HB-19. TIMP-3 increase in the culture media after N6L treatment was also observed with human mammary carcinoma MDA-MB 231 cells, human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells, and murine melanoma B16 cells (data not shown). The increase in TIMP-3 was confirmed by Western blotting using a specific anti-TIMP-3 antibody showing a unique band of 52 kDa which was previously suggested to correspond to TIMP-3 dimers (29.Hoe H.S.

These results suggest that TIMP-3 is strongly increased in the culture media after both N6L and HB-19 treatment. To examine whether the increase in TIMP-3 observed in the culture media of N6L- and HB-19-treated cells was due to its increased expression, RT-PCR was performed on the treated cells at 1, 6, and 18 h. However, no variation in TIMP-3 mRNA expression could be observed with time in either the control cells or in treated cells (Fig. 2A). We next analyzed TIMP-3 in the cell lysates by Western blotting to examine the possibility that these pseudopeptides may increase TIMP-3 protein expression by a translational process involving no mRNA modification. Surprisingly, compared with control cells, TIMP-3 was reduced in lysates of treated cells (Fig. 2, B and C). This was confirmed by immunolabeling analysis of TIMP-3 in MDA-MB-435 cells treated for 48 h with either 10 μm N6L or HB-19, which revealed a decrease in the cell-associated TIMP-3 (Fig. 2D). Again, a stronger effect was observed with N6L compared with HB-19. Altogether, these results suggest that TIMP-3 is displaced from the cell surface by the multivalent pseudopeptides and released into culture medium. As N6L displays stronger activity than HB-19, we next focused our studies using N6L exclusively. We then questioned the mode of action by which N6L can release TIMP-3. We first hypothesized that N6L may have common binding sites as TIMP-3 in the matrix and at the cell surface and can therefore displace TIMP-3 and release it to the extracellular medium. Because TIMP-3 is known to bind to heparan sulfates in the ECM, we examined whether N6L can also bind to heparan sulfates. To this end we used ELISAs to evaluate the binding of biotinylated N6L on heparin-BSA complexes. Our results show that N6L bound to the heparin-BSA in a dose-dependent manner up to a 100 nm concentration (Fig. 3A). A 3.7 nm Kd value was calculated by Scatchard analysis, which corresponds to a high affinity binding of N6L to heparin. This high affinity was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance showing a 9.5 nm Kd value (Fig. 3E). The absence of heparin or the presence of 100 μm nonbiotinylated N6L as a competitor, used as control conditions, resulted in background levels of binding (supplemental Fig. 1A). Protamine and Polybrene, known for their strong interaction with heparin, and free heparin competed with N6L binding with an IC50 of 10 μm, 100 ng/ml, and 10 μm, respectively (Fig. 3, B–D). Moreover, N6L binding was greatly decreased after treatment of heparin-BSA complex with heparitinases I, II, and III (supplemental Fig. 1B). All of these data demonstrate the specificity of the binding of N6L with heparin. In addition, N6L displayed higher affinity to heparin than HB-19, which could explain why N6L displaces more efficiently TIMP-3 than HB-19 (supplemental Fig. 1C). To examine whether N6L can also interact with sulfated GAGs present on the cell surface, we analyzed N6L-A488 binding to MDA-MB-435 cells treated or not with heparitinases I, II, and III (Hase) and chondroitinases A, B, and C (Chase) which can degrade heparin and chondroitin sulfates, respectively, on the cell surface. Analysis by fluorescence microscopy or FACS revealed that this enzymatic treatment resulted in a significant decrease in cell surface binding of N6L-A488 (Fig. 4). Finally, N6L displaced, in a dose-dependent manner, TIMP-3 binding on heparin in ELISA (Fig. 5A). Our results suggest that sulfated GAGs may function as a common receptor for both TIMP-3 and the multivalent pseudopeptides thereby providing a mechanism by which TIMP-3 may be released from the cell surface.FIGURE 4.N6L binding to sulfated GAGs on MDA-MB-435 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2008745620,"Cleavage of transmembrane receptors by γ-secretase is the final step in the process of regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) and has a significant impact on receptor function. Although relatively little is known about the molecular mechanism of γ-secretase enzymatic activity, it is becoming clear that substrate dimerization and/or the α-helical structure of the substrate can regulate the site and rate of γ-secretase activity. Here we show that the transmembrane domain of the pan-neurotrophin receptor p75(NTR), best known for regulating neuronal death, is sufficient for its homodimerization. Although the p75(NTR) ligands NGF and pro-NGF do not induce homerdimerization or RIP, homodimers of p75(NTR) are γ-secretase substrates. However, dimerization is not a requirement for p75(NTR) cleavage, suggesting that γ-secretase has the ability to recognize and cleave each receptor molecule independently. The transmembrane cysteine 257, which mediates covalent p75(NTR) interactions, is not crucial for homodimerization, but this residue is required for normal rates of γ-secretase cleavage. Similarly, mutation of the residues alanine 262 and glycine 266 of an AXXXG dimerization motif flanking the γ-secretase cleavage site within the p75(NTR) transmembrane domain alters the orientation of the domain and inhibits γ-secretase cleavage of p75(NTR). Nonetheless, heteromer interactions of p75(NTR) with TrkA increase full-length p75(NTR) homodimerization, which in turn potentiates the rate of γ-cleavage following TrkA activation independently of rates of α-cleavage. These results provide support for the idea that the helical structure of the p75(NTR) transmembrane domain, which may be affected by co-receptor interactions, is a key element in γ-secretase-catalyzed cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1967591469,"The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway remodels membranes during multivesicular body biogenesis, the abscission stage of cytokinesis, and enveloped virus budding. The ESCRT-III and VPS4 ATPase complexes catalyze the membrane fission events associated with these processes, and the LIP5 protein helps regulate their interactions by binding directly to a subset of ESCRT-III proteins and to VPS4. We have investigated the biochemical and structural basis for different LIP5-ligand interactions and show that the first microtubule-interacting and trafficking (MIT) module of the tandem LIP5 MIT domain binds CHMP1B (and other ESCRT-III proteins) through canonical type 1 MIT-interacting motif (MIM1) interactions. In contrast, the second LIP5 MIT module binds with unusually high affinity to a novel MIM element within the ESCRT-III protein CHMP5. A solution structure of the relevant LIP5-CHMP5 complex reveals that CHMP5 helices 5 and 6 and adjacent linkers form an amphipathic ""leucine collar"" that wraps almost completely around the second LIP5 MIT module but makes only limited contacts with the first MIT module. LIP5 binds MIM1-containing ESCRT-III proteins and CHMP5 and VPS4 ligands independently in vitro, but these interactions are coupled within cells because formation of stable VPS4 complexes with both LIP5 and CHMP5 requires LIP5 to bind both a MIM1-containing ESCRT-III protein and CHMP5. Our studies thus reveal how the tandem MIT domain of LIP5 binds different types of ESCRT-III proteins, promoting assembly of active VPS4 enzymes on the polymeric ESCRT-III substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2042240263,"The opposing regulators of ubiquitylation status, E3 ligases and deubiquitylases, are often found to be associated in complexes. Here we report on a novel interaction between the E3 ligase BRAP (also referred to as IMP), a negative regulator of the MAPK scaffold protein KSR, and two closely related deubiquitylases, USP15 and USP4. We map the interaction to the N-terminal DUSP-UBL domain of USP15 and the coiled coil region of BRAP. USP15 as well as USP4 oppose the autoubiquitylation of BRAP, whereas BRAP promotes the ubiquitylation of USP15. Importantly, USP15 but not USP4 depletion destabilizes BRAP by promoting its proteasomal degradation, and BRAP-protein levels can be rescued by reintroducing catalytically active but not inactive mutant USP15. Unexpectedly, USP15 depletion results in a decrease in amplitude of MAPK signaling in response to EGF and PDGF. We provide evidence for a model in which the dominant effect of prolonged USP15 depletion upon signal amplitude is due to a decrease in CRAF levels while allowing for the possibility that USP15 may also function to dampen MAPK signaling through direct stabilization of a negative regulator, the E3 ligase BRAP."
https://openalex.org/W2095529378,"H2A.Z association with specific genomic loci is thought to contribute to a chromatin structure that promotes transcription activation. Acetylation of H2A.Z at promoters of oncogenes has been linked to tumorigenesis. The mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that in triple negative breast cancer cells, H2A.Z bound to the promoter of the constitutively, weakly expressed cyclin D1 oncogene (CCND1), a key regulator of cellular proliferation. Depleting the pool of H2A.Z stimulated transcription of CCND1 in the absence of its cognate transcription factor, the estrogen receptor (ER). During activation of CCND1, H2A.Z was released from the transcription start site (TSS) and downstream enhancer (enh2) sequences. Concurrently, acetylation of H2A.Z, H3 and H4 at the TSS was increased but only H2A.Z was acetylated at enh2. Acetylation of H2A.Z required the Tip60 acetyltransferase to be associated with the activated CCND1 on both TSS and enh2 sites. Depletion of Tip60 prevented CCND1 activation. Chromosome conformation capture experiments (3C) revealed specific contacts between the TSS and enh2 chromatin regions. These results suggest that release of a histone H2A.Z-mediated repression loop activates CCND1 for transcription. Our findings open new avenues for controlling and understanding aberrant gene expression associated with tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1983034942,"5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is an anti-metabolite that is in clinical use for treatment of several cancers. In cells, it is converted into three distinct fluoro-based nucleotide analogs, which interfere with DNA synthesis and repair, leading to genome impairment and, eventually, apoptotic cell death. Current knowledge states that in certain cell types, 5-FU-induced stress is signaling through a p53-dependent induction of tumor necrosis factor-receptor oligomerization required for death-inducing signaling complex formation and caspase-8 activation. Here we establish a role of calcium (Ca2+) as a messenger for p53 activation in response to 5-FU. Using a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches, we show that treatment of colon carcinoma cells stimulates entry of extracellular Ca2+ through long lasting-type plasma membrane channels, which further directs posttranslational phosphorylation of at least three p53 serine residues (S15, S33 and S37) by means of calmodulin (CaM) activity. Obstructing this pathway by the Ca2+-chelator BAPTA (1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane- N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid) or by inhibitors of CaM efficiently reduces 5-FU-induced caspase activities and subsequent cell death. Moreover, ectopic expression of p53 S15A in HCT116 p53−/− cells confirmed the importance of a Ca2+–CaM–p53 axis in 5-FU-induced extrinsic apoptosis. The fact that a widely used therapeutic drug, such as 5-FU, is operating via this pathway could provide new therapeutic intervention points, or specify new combinatorial treatment regimes."

Vps4 activity is stimulated by the interaction between Vta1 and Vps60, but the structural basis for this interaction is unclear. The fragment Vps60(128-186) was reported to display the full activity of Vps60. Vta1 interacts with Vps60 using its N-terminal domain (Vta1NTD). In this work, the structure of Vps60(128-186) in complex with Vta1NTD was determined using NMR techniques, demonstrating a novel recognition mode of the microtubule-interacting and transport (MIT) domain in which Vps60(128-186) interacts with Vta1NTD through helices α4' and α5', extending over Vta1NTD MIT2 domain helices 1-3. The Vps60 binding does not result in Vta1 conformational changes, further revealing the fact that Vps4 ATPase is enhanced by the interaction between Vta1 and Vps60 in an unanticipated manner."
https://openalex.org/W1997899863,"The protein complex of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1 and TSC2 tumor suppressors is a key negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Hyperactive mTOR signaling due to the loss-of-function of mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 gene causes TSC, an autosomal dominant disorder featured with benign tumors in multiple organs. As the ubiquitous second messenger calcium (Ca2+) regulates various cellular processes involved in tumorigenesis, we explored the potential role of mTOR in modulation of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis, and in turn the effect of Ca2+ signaling in TSC-related tumor development. We found that loss of Tsc2 potentiated store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in an mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)-dependent way. The endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor, stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), was upregulated in Tsc2-deficient cells, and was suppressed by mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. In addition, SOCE repressed AKT1 phosphorylation. Blocking SOCE either by depleting STIM1 or ectopically expressing dominant-negative Orai1 accelerated TSC-related tumor development, likely because of restored AKT1 activity and enhanced tumor angiogenesis. Our data, therefore, suggest that mTORC1 enhancement of store-operated Ca2+ signaling hinders TSC-related tumor growth through suppression of AKT1 signaling. The augmented SOCE by hyperactive mTORC1-STIM1 cascade may contribute to the benign nature of TSC-related tumors. Application of SOCE agonists could thus be a contraindication for TSC patients. In contrast, SOCE agonists should attenuate mTOR inhibitors-mediated AKT reactivation and consequently potentiate their efficacy in the treatment of the patients with TSC."

Endothelial cells are also critical for many processes in postnatal life including exchange of nutrients, blood clotting, and migration of immune cells toward inflamed tissues. Blood vessel development occurs through two consecutive processes, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Vasculogenesis involves blood vessel formation from pluripotent mesenchymal cells, whereas angiogenesis implicates blood vessel formation from existing vessels. Both require extensive endothelial cell proliferation and migration.

However, the identity of the PTP(s) influencing this pathway in endothelial cells has not been determined. Here we examined the role of PTP-PEST in endothelial cells. Using primary endothelial cells from an inducible PTP-PEST-deficient mouse, we found that PTP-PEST is required for migration and adhesion of endothelial cells, but not for proliferation, differentiation, and modulation of permeability to macromolecules by these cells. This function correlates with the capacity of PTP-PEST to dephosphorylate Cas, paxillin, and Pyk2. Studies of a mouse in which PTP-PEST was specifically eliminated in endothelial cells provided evidence that the function of PTP-PEST in endothelial cells is critical for normal vascular development and embryonic viability. Mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre (Cre-ERT2) under the control of the ubiquitin C promoter (UBC-Cre-ERT2) or the Cre recombinase under the control of the Tie2 promoter (Tie2-Cre), and ROSA26EYFP mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) (33.Kisanuki Y.Y.

They were then bred with mice expressing a conditionally deleted allele of the PTP-PEST-encoding gene, Ptpn12fl, back-crossed for at least 15 generations to the C57BL/6 background (11.Davidson D.

A constitutive PTP-PEST-deficient mouse (Ptpn12−/−) in which PTP-PEST expression was constitutively lacking in all cells was generated by breeding Ptpn12fl/+ mice with mice expressing a ubiquitous Cre transgene (11.Davidson D.

Timed matings were set up between male Ptpn12fl/+;Tie2-Cre+ and female Ptpn12fl/fl mice. Day 0.5 of embryonic development (E0.5) was defined as the morning when the vaginal plug was observed. All mice used in this study were bred under specific pathogen-free conditions. Animal experimentation was approved by the Clinical Research Institute of Montreal Animal Care Committee in accordance with the regulations of the Canadian Council for Animal Care. Female Ptpn12fl/fl mice were bred with male Ptpn12fl/+;UBC-Cre-ERT2+ mice. For tamoxifen-induced deletion of PTP-PEST, mice were fed for 5 consecutives days with tamoxifen (200 μg/g of weight/day in corn oil; Sigma-Aldrich). After 10 days, mice were sacrificed and used for endothelial cell isolation. Primary lung-derived endothelial cells were extracted from lung tissue of 8–10-week-old mice as described below for embryonic endothelial cells. Cells were then cultured in low glucose DMEM/F-12 medium (1:1 mixture; Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Logan, UT), endothelial growth supplement (5 μg/ml; BD Biosciences), and heparin (100 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) using gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes. Two successive rounds of endothelial cell purification were then performed using rat anti-mouse ICAM-2 antibody (mAb 3C4, BD Biosciences) coupled to sheep anti-rat IgG-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Invitrogen). The purity of endothelial cells was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis using antibodies directed against the endothelial cell markers CD31 (rat anti-mouse CD31 mAb 390, eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and ICAM-2 (rat anti-mouse mAb 3C4, Biolegend, San Diego, CA). After 16 days in culture, cells were used for experimentation. At that time, >95% of cells expressed the endothelial cell-specific markers. Embryos and yolk sacs were harvested using a dissecting microscope (Model MZ12, Leica) and photographed using QImaging MicroPublisher with a real time viewing camera (QImaging, Surrey, British Columbia, Canada) and Northern Eclipse 7.0 software (Empix Imaging Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Yolk sacs were used to genotype the embryos. For whole-mount staining, embryos were fixed at 4 °C overnight in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% paraformaldehyde (Canemco, Québec, Canada). After blocking for 2 h at room temperature in a PBS solution containing 2% skim milk and 2.5% Triton X-100, embryos were incubated overnight with purified rat anti-mouse CD31 monoclonal antibody (mAb MEC13.3, BD Biosciences). After several washes, embryos were incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of a 1:500 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488-coupled goat anti-rat IgG (Invitrogen). After several washes, images were obtained by confocal microscopy using an LSM710 microscope (Zeiss). For cross-section analyses, fixed embryos were embedded in Epon, sectioned (0.5-μm thickness), and stained with toluidine blue. They were then visualized by microscopy (Axiophot, Zeiss) as described above. Male Ptpn12fl/+;Rosa26EYFP+;Tie2-Cre+ mice were bred with female Ptpn12fl/fl;ROSA26EYFP+ mice. E10.5 embryos were harvested from timed pregnancies, washed, minced, and digested at 37 °C for 1 h with collagenase A (1 mg/ml; Roche Applied Science). To remove undigested material, the cell suspension was washed through a cell strainer (BD Biosciences). Isolated cells were then incubated on ice for 1 h with the antibodies described below. Cells were washed, and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-positive (EYFP+) cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). Embryonic cells or primary lung-derived endothelial cells were stained and analyzed by flow cytometry using the following antibodies (from Biolegend, BD Biosciences, or eBioscience): Alexa Fluor 647-coupled rat anti-mouse CD31 (mAb 390), Alexa Fluor 647-coupled rat anti-mouse ICAM-1 (mAb YN1/1.7.4), Alexa Fluor 647-coupled rat anti-mouse ICAM-2 (mAb 3C4), Alexa Fluor 647-coupled rat anti-mouse VE-cadherin (mAb VECD1), phycoerythrin-coupled hamster anti-mouse β1 integrin (CD29; mAb HMb1-1), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-coupled rat anti-mouse β2 integrin (CD18; mAb M18/2), and rat anti-mouse isotype control (mAb RTK2758). Primary lung-derived endothelial cells (4 × 104 cells) were seeded in 24-well, gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes. At the desired time point, cells were harvested by trypsin (Invitrogen) and counted. 96-well flat-bottom Immuno plates (Nunc, Thermoscientific, Rochester, NY) were coated overnight with fibronectin (10 μg/ml; BD Biosciences), type I collagen (10 μg/ml; BD Biosciences), or bovine serum albumin (BSA; 2 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). After washing, plates were blocked with BSA, and 104 endothelial cells were allowed to adhere for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing away non-adherent cells, adherent cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet (Fisher Scientific). Cell adhesion was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 562 nm in a microplate scanning spectrometer (Power Wave X, Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). Photographs were also obtained using an inverted microscope (Model Axiovert S100TV, Zeiss) with a QImaging camera and Volocity image analysis software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Coverslips were coated at 4 °C overnight with fibronectin or collagen as above. Then coverslips were washed with PBS and placed in 6-well dishes. Endothelial cells were harvested and seeded (1 × 105 cells) on the coverslips. After 90 min at 37 °C, unbound cells were washed, and the remaining cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and mounted on a glass slide for examination by contrast microscopy. Data from 10 independent fields were acquired. For Transwell migration assays, endothelial cells were deprived of growth supplement and FBS overnight. Then 105 cells were loaded in the upper chamber of a Transwell insert (8-μm pores; Costar, Corning, Lowell, MA) previously coated with fibronectin (5 μg/ml). The medium in the lower chamber was then replaced by medium containing 20% FBS, endothelial growth supplement (5 μg/ml; BD Biosciences), and heparin (100 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were allowed to migrate for 24 h. Cells having migrated in the lower chamber were counted using Volocity image analysis software. For wound healing assays, endothelial cells were cultured in gelatin-coated 6-well tissue culture plates (Nunc). Once the monolayer was confluent, a scratch was performed using a 200-μl pipette tip. Wound closure was monitored with a time lapse microscope (DM IRE2, Leica), capturing images every 10 min. The speed of migration and persistence index, which is calculated as the ratio of the distance between the first and the last points of the tracked cells over the total distance traveled, were assessed after labeling cells with Hoechst using Volocity image analysis software. Image analyses and measurements were performed using Matlab software (MathWorks Inc., Torrance, CA). Permeability was measured using type I collagen-coated Transwell units (0.4-μm pores; Costar). The indicated numbers of endothelial cells were seeded in the upper chamber and allowed to form a monolayer. Once a monolayer was formed, cells were deprived of serum and endothelial growth supplement for 1 or in some cases 4 h. After deprivation, FITC-dextran (molecular weight, 40,000; 1 mg/ml; Invitrogen) was added to the upper chamber and allowed to diffuse into the lower chamber for 30 or 60 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 75 ng/ml) (36.Thibeault S. Rautureau Y. Oubaha M. Faubert D. Wilkes B.C. Delisle C. Gratton J.P. S-Nitrosylation of β-catenin by eNOS-derived NO promotes VEGF-induced endothelial cell permeability.Mol.

Endothelial permeability was determined by measuring the fluorescence in the lower chamber at 520 nm with an excitation wavelength of 492 nm. Triplicates measurements were taken. Cells were lysed directly on the plate with TNE buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described (37.Veillette A.

Immunoprecipitation was accomplished by incubating 400 μg of total cell lysates with a protein-specific antibody for 45 min at 4 °C. To collect immune complexes, Pansorbin (Calbiochem, EMD Millipore) was added for an additional 45 min. Unbound proteins were washed away, and the precipitated protein was loaded for 8% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were performed as outlined elsewhere (37.Veillette A. Bookman M.A. Horak E.M. Bolen J.B.

The following antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation: Cas (sc-860, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), paxillin (610272, BD Biosciences), and FAK (sc-558, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Phosphospecific antibodies against FAK (Tyr(P)-397 (3483) and Tyr(P)-576/577 (3281)) and antibodies recognizing phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (mAb E10) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). The following antibodies were used for reprobing the membrane: Cas (sc-860 (Santa Cruz Technology, Santa Cruz, CA)), paxillin (610272, BD Biosciences), FAK (610088, BD Biosciences), and ERK (06-182, Millipore, Burlington, Ontario, Canada).

https://openalex.org/W1968180930,"The incidence of malignant melanoma is growing rapidly worldwide and there is still no effective therapy for metastatic disease. This type of cancer is highly resistant to conventional DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics, and intense research has been dedicated for understanding the molecular pathways underlying chemoresistance. The Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway is often deregulated in melanoma, which frequently harbours activating mutations in NRAS or BRAF. Herein, we demonstrate that the MAPK-activated protein kinase RSK (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase) contributes to melanoma chemoresistance by altering their response to chemotherapeutic agents. We find that RSK phosphorylates checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) at an inhibitory site, Ser280, both in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that RSK is the predominant protein kinase operating downstream of mitogens and oncogenes of the Ras/MAPK pathway, and consistent with this, we find that RSK constitutively phosphorylates Chk1 in melanoma. We show that RSK inhibition increases Chk1 activity in response to DNA-damaging agents, suggesting that the Ras/MAPK pathway modulates Chk1 function and the response to DNA damage. Accordingly, we demonstrate that RSK promotes G2 DNA damage checkpoint silencing in a Chk1-dependent manner, and find that RSK inhibitors sensitize melanoma cells to DNA-damaging agents. Together, our results identify a novel link between the Ras/MAPK pathway and the DNA damage response, and suggest that RSK inhibitors may be used to modulate chemosensitivity, which is one of the major obstacles to melanoma treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2038330162,"Human VRK2 (vaccinia-related kinase 2), a kinase that emerged late in evolution, affects different signaling pathways, and some carcinomas express high levels of VRK2. Invasion by cancer cells has been associated with NFAT1 (nuclear factor of activated T cells) activation and expression of the COX-2 (cyclooxygenase 2) gene. We hypothesized that VRK proteins might play a regulatory role in NFAT1 activation in tumor cells. We demonstrate that VRK2 directly interacts and phosphorylates NFAT1 in Ser-32 within its N-terminal transactivation domain. VRK2 increases NFAT1-dependent transcription by phosphorylation, and this effect is only detected following cell phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin stimulation and calcineurin activation. This NFAT1 hyperactivation by VRK2 increases COX-2 gene expression through the proximal NFAT1 binding site in the COX-2 gene promoter. Furthermore, VRK2A down-regulation by RNA interference reduces COX-2 expression at transcriptional and protein levels. Therefore, VRK2 down-regulation reduces cell invasion by tumor cells, such as MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435, upon stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus ionomycin. These findings identify the first reported target and function of human VRK2 as an active kinase playing a role in regulation of cancer cell invasion through the NFAT pathway and COX-2 expression."

Here, we describe the regulation of FA dynamics and cell motility by pseudopodium-enriched atypical kinase 1 (PEAK1, KIAA2002, Sgk269). We originally identified PEAK1 in a proteomics analysis of proteins enriched in the pseudopodia of migrating cells (17Wang Y. Kelber J.A. Tran Cao H.S. Cantin G.T. Lin R. Wang W. Kaushal S.

Additionally, PEAK1 associates with the actin cytoskeleton and FAs in migrating cells and promotes the elongation of developing FAs (17Wang Y. Kelber J.A. Tran Cao H.S. Cantin G.T. Lin R. Wang W.

PEAK1 is phosphorylated by SFKs downstream of the EGF receptor and integrins, suggesting that PEAK1 function may be regulated by SFK signaling (17Wang Y. Kelber J.A. Tran Cao H.S. Cantin G.T. Lin R.

In this study, we examined the role of PEAK1 in FA dynamics to better understand the function of PEAK1 in cell migration and cancer progression. We found that PEAK1 plays an instrumental role in regulating the formation, maturation, and disassembly of FAs, which are pivotal for cell migration. The proper function of PEAK1 is dependent on dynamic phosphorylation of Tyr-665. Blocking PEAK1 phosphorylation and mimicking constitutive phosphorylation at Tyr-665 both impair PEAK1 function.

HT1080 cells stably expressing shCntrl, sh_2, or sh_3 were generated by lentiviral transduction, and positively expressing cells were isolated with puromycin selection or FACS. Human c-Src-specific ON-TARGET plus siRNA SMART pool was from Thermo Scientific. PEAK1, with point mutations, was generated using the QuikChange® II XL Site-directed Mutagenesis kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Human PEAK1 cDNA in the GFP-TriEx4 vector was used as a template for mutagenesis. The following primers were used to generate PEAK1-Y665F_sense: 5′-ccacaagtgtaataagccatacttttgaagaaatagaaacagaaagcaaagtgcc-3′; PEAK1-Y665F_antisense: 5′-ggcactttgctttctgtttctatttcttcaaaagtatggcttattacacttgtgg-3′; PEAK1-Y665E_sense: 5′-ccacaagtgtaataagccatactgaggaagaaatagaaacagaaagcaaagtgcc-3′; and PEAK1-Y665E_antisense: 5′-gcactttgctttctgtttctatttcttcctcagtatggcttattacacttgtgg-3′. Total RNA from HT1080 shCntrl, sh_2, and sh_3 stable cell lines was extracted using the RNA EasyKit from Macherey-Nagel (Bethlehem, PA) and reverse-transcribed using an iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). Quantitative PCRs were performed using TaqmanFast Universal PCR Mastermix 2×, Taqman PEAK1, and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (used as a control) primer probes, and the Step One Plus Real-Time PCR system instrument (Applied Biosystems). Immunoblotting was performed using PVDF membranes and 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Membranes were blocked in 1% BSA or 5% nonfat milk. Cell extracts were harvested for immunoprecipitation assays using radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors added. Protein concentrations were normalized to 1 mg/ml. Cell extracts were precleared with a 10% slurry of protein G beads in RIPA buffer. Precleared extracts were incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-GFP antibody (ab290) overnight at 4 °C, and proteins were pulled down with 10% protein G slurry in prepared RIPA at 4 °C for 1 h. Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF), epifluorescence, and phase contrast imaging were performed using a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope running Nikon Elements software and equipped with an in vivoTM climate-controlled chamber and a Nikon electronic programmable stage and Perfect Focus. This microscope is also outfitted with 488- and 561-nm solid state laser lines and an Andor iXonEM+ camera for TIRF, and Plan Fluor 10× (N.A. 0.30), and APO TIRF 60× oil immersion (N.A. 1.45) objectives. Phase contrast and epifluorescence images were collected with a Hamamatsu Orca CCD camera. HT1080 cells co-expressing GFP-tagged PEAK1 (GFP-PEAK1, WT PEAK1), GFP-tagged PEAK1 Tyr-665 mutants (Y665E or Y665F), or GFP (EV) and mCherry-paxillin, or with siRNA, as indicated, were plated at low density on glass-bottom dishes coated with fibronectin for 1 h at 37 °C or at 4 °C overnight and allowed to attach in complete DMEM at 37 °C. The cultures were washed briefly with sterile PBS and incubated in serum-free medium along with drugs or vehicle, as indicated, for 1–2 h. Immediately before filming, the medium was replaced with phenol red-free complete DMEM containing 40 μm PP2 or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide), as indicated. Time-lapse TIRF images were collected in both the red and green channels using Nikon Elements software at 60× every 30 s for 1 h, and the images were analyzed using Metamorph software. FA lifetime was determined by calculating the time that passed between the first appearance of mCherry-paxillin in a developing adhesion and the last frame in which that same tagged molecule was visible. PEAK1 (WT or point mutants, as indicated) in FAs was similarly assessed. Lag time was calculated by subtracting the amount of time that elapsed between the first appearance of mCherry-paxillin and the first appearance of GFP-tagged PEAK1 or PEAK1 mutants in developing adhesions. Adhesion assembly and disassembly were analyzed as described previously (11Webb D.J. Donais K. Whitmore L.A. Thomas S.M. Turner C.E. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F.

Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 4535-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, the background-subtracted fluorescence intensity of individual adhesions was tracked over time for at least 15 individual adhesions in a minimum of 5 cells/condition as they assembled or disassembled, and these values were used to generate a t½ value (half-life) for FA assembly or disassembly. Random migration of 5 × 104 cells plated in fibronectin-coated 6-well plates was assessed using Metamorph software. Images were captured using a 10× phase contrast objective. Time-lapse images were collected every 5 min for at least 10 h for each condition. Transwell and Matrigel invasion assays were performed as described previously (21Webb D.J. Nguyen D.H. Gonias S.L. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase functions in the urokinase receptor-dependent pathway by which neutralization of low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein promotes fibrosarcoma cell migration and Matrigel invasion.J.

We demonstrated previously that PEAK1 gene silencing in MDA-MB-435 cells inhibits the ability of these cells to establish xenografts in mice (14Carragher N.O. Frame M.C. Focal adhesion and actin dynamics: a place where kinases and proteases meet to promote invasion.Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 241-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). We also showed that PEAK1 overexpression promotes cell migration in vitro (17Wang Y. Kelber J.A. Tran Cao H.S. Cantin G.T. Lin R. Wang W. Kaushal S. Bristow J.M. Edgington T.S. Hoffman R.M. Bouvet M.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 10920-10925Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this study, first we examined random cell migration by video imaging HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells in which PEAK1 was silenced by transduction with lentivirus encoding either of two short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Fig. 1A shows that PEAK1 was silenced by 40–50% when we used shRNA targeting the coding region of PEAK1 (sh_2) or the 3′-UTR region of PEAK1 (sh_3). Although incomplete, PEAK1 gene silencing was associated with a significant decrease in random cell migration. Representative migration maps are shown in Fig. 1, B–D, and summarized results are presented in Fig. 1E. Next, we tested whether PEAK1 regulates FA dynamics. Cells in which PEAK1 was silenced with sh_2 or sh_3 demonstrated a decrease in FA lifetime (Fig. 1F), accompanied by a decrease in assembly time (Fig. 1G) and an increase in disassembly time (Fig. 1H), as determined by monitoring mCherry-paxillin fluorescence by TIRF time-lapse microscopy. These results, which are summarized in supplemental Table S1, suggest that PEAK1 stabilizes FAs overall, while extending the time during which FAs enlarge (t½ assembly) but, at the same time, promoting more rapid FA disassembly. We and others have shown that PEAK1 phosphorylation is significantly increased by Src in cancer cells (17Wang Y. Kelber J.A. Tran Cao H.S. Cantin G.T. Lin R. Wang W. Kaushal S. Bristow J.M.

As such, Tyr-665 is thought to be an important site for the control of PEAK1 function; therefore, we mutated Tyr-665 to further evaluate the function of PEAK1 in FA dynamics and cell migration. Fig. 2A shows that fusion proteins of GFP with wild-type (WT) PEAK1 and PEAK1 in which Tyr-665 is mutated to Glu (Y665E) or Phe (Y665F) were expressed at comparable levels in HT1080 cells; however, endogenous PEAK1 is expressed in relatively low levels in these cells compared with the exogenously expressed form of the protein. Because we previously reported that PEAK1 localizes with the actin cytoskeleton and with FAs (17Wang Y. Kelber J.A. Tran Cao H.S. Cantin G.T. Lin R. Wang W. Kaushal S. Bristow J.M. Edgington T.S. Hoffman R.M. Bouvet M. Yates 3rd, J.R. Klemke R.L. Pseudopodium-enriched atypical kinase 1 regulates the cytoskeleton and cancer progression [corrected].Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 10920-10925Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we tested whether mutation of Tyr-665 alters the subcellular localization of PEAK1. Time-lapse TIRF microscopy imaging of mCherry-actin and PEAK1 showed that Y665E mutation had no effect on PEAK1 localization with actin (Fig. 2B and supplemental Movies 1 and 2). By contrast, Y665E demonstrated a substantial decrease in co-localization with mCherry-paxillin in FAs (Fig. 2C). Fig. 2D and supplemental Table S1 show that expression of WT PEAK1 (supplemental Movie 4) significantly increased FA lifetime; however, Y665E (supplemental Movie 5) failed to lengthen the FA lifetime. Similarly, Y665E failed to reproduce the increase in t½ FA assembly (Fig. 2E) and the decrease in t½ disassembly (Fig. 2F) that were observed in cells transfected with WT PEAK1. Mutation of Tyr to Glu typically produces a model of constitutive phosphorylation (24Kassenbrock C.K. Anderson S.M.

Identification of amino acid sequences in the integrin β1 cytoplasmic domain implicated in cytoskeletal association.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Our results with Y665E suggest that constitutive phosphorylation of PEAK1 at Tyr-665 is inactivating. Because Y665E failed to regulate FA dynamics, we hypothesized that Y665E would also fail to promote cell migration. To test this hypothesis, first we examined random cell migration. As shown in the representative cell migration maps in Fig. 3A and in the results summary (Fig. 3B), PEAK1 overexpression increased random cell migration (compared with EV) whereas Y665E actually decreased random cell migration. In Transwell migration assays, once again WT PEAK1 promoted cell migration, and Y665E failed to reproduce the effects of the wild-type protein (Fig. 3C). Thus, the ability of PEAK1 to regulate FA dynamics correlates with its ability to regulate cell migration. To block Tyr-665 phosphorylation, we mutated this amino acid to Phe (Y665F). Y665F demonstrated unchanged localization with mCherry-actin, compared with WT PEAK1 (Fig. 4A and supplemental Movies 1 and 3). Y665F also demonstrated unchanged co-localization with mCherry-paxillin, compared with WT PEAK1 (Fig. 4B and supplemental Movies 4 and 6). However, like the phosphomimetic form of the kinase, Y665F was ineffective in its ability to regulate FA dynamics. Y665F significantly decreased FA lifetime, compared with those measured in cells transfected with EV (Fig. 4C). Y665F failed to lengthen FA assembly time similarly to WT PEAK1 (Fig. 4D). However, Y665F did shorten the disassembly time (Fig. 4E). In addition to our analysis of PEAK1-mediated FA dynamics using paxillin as an FA marker, we also analyzed WT and mutant PEAK1 dynamics in these cells. These data, summarized in supplemental Table S1, indicate that WT or mutant PEAK1 dynamics, including total lifetime, t½ of assembly, and t½ of disassembly, closely mirror those of paxillin under identical conditions. However, WT PEAK1 entered adhesions, on average, >1 min after adhesions were detectable by paxillin fluorescence. By contrast, Y665F entered FAs almost simultaneously with the initial detection of paxillin fluorescence (supplemental Table S1). These results indicate that modifying Tyr-665 so that it cannot be phosphorylated or so that it mimics a constitutively phosphorylated state alters the activity of PEAK1 in the regulation of FA dynamics. Because Y665F expression affected PEAK1-mediated FA dynamics, we next sought to examine the effects of blocking Tyr-665 phosphorylation on PEAK1-mediated cell migration. Representative cell migration maps and a summary of results comparing random migration of WT PEAK1 and Y665F are shown in Fig. 5, A and B, respectively. Like the phosphomimetic mutant, Y665F failed to promote random cell migration. These results were confirmed using the Transwell model system, in which we also found that Y665F failed to promote cell migration like WT PEAK1 (Fig. 5C). Invasion through Matrigel in vitro depends not only on the ability of the cell to migrate but also on its ability to remodel extracellular matrix (6Larsen M. Artym V.V. Green J.A. Yamada K.M.

https://openalex.org/W2041396622,"Protein kinase C delta (PKCδ) is a serine (Ser)/threonine kinase, which regulates numerous cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis. In the current study, Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with either a constitutively activated PKCδ or a dominant negative PKCδ, phosphoprotein enrichment, two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry was combined to globally identified candidates of PKCδ cascade. We found that Bcl-2 associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) was one of the targets of PKCδ cascade, and BAG3 interacted with PKCδ in vivo. In addition, we clarified that BAG3 was phosphorylate at Ser187 site in a PKCδ-dependent manner in vivo. BAG3 has been implicated in multiple cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, macroautophagy and so on. We generated wild-type (WT)-, Ser187Ala (S187A)- or Ser187Asp (S187D)-BAG3 stably expressing FRO cells, and noticed that phosphorylation state of BAG3 influenced FRO morphology. Finally, for the first time, we showed that BAG3 was implicated in epithelial−mesenchymal transition (EMT) procedure, and phosphorylation state at Ser187 site had a critical role in EMT regulation by BAG3. Collectively, the current study indicates that BAG3 is a novel substrate of PKCδ, and PKCδ-mediated phosphorylation of BAG3 is implicated in EMT and invasiveness of thyroid cancer cells."

TAT is inefficient, and its activity is enhanced when tubulin is incorporated in microtubules. Acetylation is associated with stable microtubules and regulates the binding of microtubule motors and associated proteins. TAT is important in neuronal polarity and mechanosensation, and decreased tubulin acetylation levels are associated with axonal transport defects and neurodegeneration. We present the first structure of TAT in complex with acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA) at 2.7 Å resolution. The structure reveals a conserved stable catalytic core shared with other GCN5 superfamily acetyltransferases consisting of a central β-sheet flanked by α-helices and a C-terminal β-hairpin unique to TAT. Structure-guided mutagenesis establishes the molecular determinants for Ac-CoA and tubulin substrate recognition. The wild-type TAT construct is a monomer in solution. We identify a metastable interface between the conserved core and N-terminal domain that modulates the oligomerization of TAT in solution and is essential for activity. The 2.45 Å resolution structure of an inactive TAT construct with an active site point mutation near this interface reveals a domain-swapped dimer in which the functionally essential N terminus shows evidence of marked structural plasticity. The sequence segment corresponding to this structurally plastic region in TAT has been implicated in substrate recognition in other GCN5 superfamily acetyltransferases. Our structures provide a rational platform for the mechanistic dissection of TAT activity and the design of TAT inhibitors with therapeutic potential in neuronal regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2084601739,"The DNA glycosylase MUTYH (mutY homolog (Escherichia coli)) counteracts the mutagenic effects of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxodG) by removing adenine (A) misincorporated opposite the oxidized purine. Biallelic germline mutations in MUTYH cause the autosomal recessive MUTYH-associated adenomatous polyposis (MAP). Here we designed new tools to investigate the biochemical defects and biological consequences associated with different MUTYH mutations in human cells. To identify phenotype(s) associated with MUTYH mutations, lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) were derived from seven MAP patients harboring missense as well as truncating mutations in MUTYH. These included homozygous p.Arg245His, p.Gly264TrpfsX7 or compound heterozygous variants (p.Gly396Asp/Arg245Cys, p.Gly396Asp/Tyr179Cys, p.Gly396Asp/Glu410GlyfsX43, p.Gly264TrpfsX7/Ala385ProfsX23 and p.Gly264TrpfsX7/Glu480del). DNA glycosylase assays of MAP LCL extracts confirmed that all these variants were defective in removing A from an 8-oxoG:A DNA substrate, but retained wild-type OGG1 activity. As a consequence of this defect, MAP LCLs accumulated DNA 8-oxodG in their genome and exhibited a fourfold increase in spontaneous mutagenesis at the PIG-A gene compared with LCLs from healthy donors. They were also hypermutable by KBrO3—a source of DNA 8-oxodG—indicating that the relatively modest spontaneous mutator phenotype associated with MUTYH loss can be significantly enhanced by conditions of oxidative stress. These observations identify accumulation of DNA 8-oxodG and a mutator phenotype as likely contributors to the pathogenesis of MUTYH variants."
https://openalex.org/W2050096286,"Elucidating signaling events between tumor cells and their microenvironment is a major challenge in understanding cancer development. Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as an important tool for dissecting the genetic circuits tumors depend on because their imaginal discs, simple epithelia present in the larva, can be genetically manipulated to serve as models to study cancer mechanisms. Imaginal disc cells mutant for the tumor-suppressor gene scribble (scrib) lose apical-basal polarity and have the potential to form large neoplastic tumors. Interestingly, when scrib mutant (scrib−) cells are surrounded by normal cells the scrib− population is eliminated. However, the signals and mechanisms that cause the elimination of clones of scrib− cells are poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the role of Stat, a component of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, in tissues with clones of scrib− cells. We found that Stat activity is required in normal cells for the elimination of neighboring scrib− cells. Importantly, these competitive defects of stat mutant cells are not simply due to defects in cell proliferation because even stat− cells manipulated to hyperproliferate are unable to eliminate scrib− cells. These data identify Stat activity as a critical determinant of whether or not a tissue can eliminate abnormal cells and provide an important step forward in understanding the complex network of signals operating in and around tumorigenic cells."

However, the role of KLF8 in cancer remains largely unknown. Here, we report a surprisingly novel role for KLF8 in DNA repair in breast cancer cells. Comet, clonogenic, and WST-1 assays showed that KLF8 expression is required for protecting human breast cancer cells from doxorubicin-induced DNA damage and cell death. Western blotting indicated that overexpression of ectopic KLF8 attenuated the levels of the DNA damage marker γH2A.X in doxorubicin-treated PARP-1+/+ but not PARP-1−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts, whereas the PARP-1-binding-defective KLF8 mutant failed to do so. Interestingly, in response to the DNA damage, KLF8 was phosphorylated by the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit and, subsequently, SUMOylated by SUMO E3 ligases protein inhibitors of activated STAT (PIASs), which depends upon the interaction of KLF8 with DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, PIASs, and PARP-1 as well as their enzymatic activities. Lastly, we show evidence that KLF8 was recruited to the DNA damage site. These results suggest a novel role and mechanism for KLF8 in the regulation of DNA repair and therapeutic resistance in breast cancer cells.

In actively dividing normal cells, the genomic integrity is constantly threatened by DNA damage, resulting in DNA lesions such as single-strand breaks (SSBs) 2The abbreviations used are: SSBsingle-strand breakDSBdouble-strand breakDNA-PKDNA-dependent protein kinaseDNA-PKcsDNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunitMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastIPimmunoprecipitationBRCAbreast cancer. and double-strand breaks (DSBs) (1.Lord C.J. Ashworth A. The DNA damage response and cancer therapy.Nature. 2012; 481: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). To maintain the genomic integrity and thus avoid cell death or transformation, normal cells have inherited a variety of DNA repair mechanisms that fix SSBs or DSBs by the master sensors and regulators of DNA damage such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), BRCA1, BRCA2, and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (2.Cleaver J.E.

Because of their genotoxic and, thus, cytotoxic effect on cancer cells, DNA-damaging agents have been the mainstay of cancer therapy for decades. However, DNA damage responses by suboptimal or inaccurate DNA repair mechanisms not only arm cancer cells with therapeutic resistance but also contribute to aggressive progression of tumors by causing genomic instability (1.Lord C.J. Ashworth A. The DNA damage response and cancer therapy.Nature. 2012; 481: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). For this reason, inhibitors targeting DNA repair proteins such as PARP-1 and DNA-PK have been actively developed and tested to improve the cancer therapy (1.Lord C.J. Ashworth A. The DNA damage response and cancer therapy.Nature. 2012; 481: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar).

MCF-10A cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant KLF8 for 24 h. The cells were then treated with doxorubicin, reseeded at low density, and allowed to grow for 2 weeks to allow colonies to form. Colonies were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and counted. Colonies containing ∼50 or more cells were counted. The cell sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin was assayed using Clontech WST-1 cell proliferation reagent (catalog no. 630118) according to the instructions of the manufacturer (PT3946-1) (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA). Briefly, cells of appropriate density were seeded and treated similarly as in a clonogenic assay. After being grown for 48 h, the cells were incubated with the WST-1 reagent for 2 h before optical density (A) values at 440-nm wavelength were measured using a multiplate bioreader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The OD values represent the cell viability. Cellular DNA damage was induced by treating the cells in culture with the DNA-intercalating agent doxorubicin. Overall DNA damage levels were assessed by Comet assay using alkaline single-cell agarose gel electrophoresis and the Trevigen Comet assay kit (4250-050-K, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were treated with doxorubicin with certain doses or at certain time points, harvested, and subjected to Comet analysis. After staining with SYBR Green, Comet images were captured by fluorescence microscopy. Tail moments (percentage of DNA in tail × tail length) were quantitated for 100 cells/slide using CometScore software. Western blotting was performed to determine the levels of γH2A.X, a marker for double-strand breaks of damaged DNA. Western blot analyses were quantified by chemiluminescence blot of Image Lab 3.0 (Bio-Rad). To control the exposure time between blots, for every panel, all membranes were exposed for the same duration. Then the quantitative data from three independent experiments were statistically analyzed. The reduction in the levels of DNA damage during the period of cell recovery post-doxorubicin removal was considered an indicator for DNA repair. All the data were summarized and presented as mean ± S.D. with a minimum of three observations per group. Unpaired, paired or single sample Student's t test with the Bonferroni correction for the multiple comparisons or Qi-Square test was applied as appropriate. Significance was determined by the α level of 0.05. To test whether KLF8 expression protects breast cancer cells from death induced by DNA-damaging agent, we first treated our 231-K8ikd cells (an MDA-MB-231 variant expressing aberrantly high levels of endogenous KLF8 and Tet-on inducible short hairpin RNA against KLF8 (26.Wang X. Lu H. Urvalek A.M. Li T. Yu L. Lamar J. DiPersio C.M. Feustel P.J. Zhao J.

We found that when KLF8 knockdown was induced (I), the cells became more sensitive to doxorubicin-induced cell death than when KLF8 knockdown was uninduced (U). Conversely, in our 10A-iK8 cells (a MCF-10A cell line expressing little or no endogenous KLF8 and Tet-on inducible ectopic KLF8 (26.Wang X. Lu H. Urvalek A.M. Li T. Yu L. Lamar J. DiPersio C.M.

KLF8 promotes human breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis by transcriptional activation of MMP9.Oncogene. 2011; 30: 1901-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar)), the cells became more resistant to doxorubicin-induced death when the ectopic KLF8 expression was induced (I) than when the ectopic KLF8 expression was uninduced (U) (Fig. 1, A and C, right panels). Similar results were reproduced by the independent cell viability analysis using WST-1 assays (Fig. 1, B and D). To test whether the expression levels of KLF8 in the cells affect the levels of DNA damage induced by doxorubicin, the cells were treated with doxorubicin similarly, and the levels of DNA damage were determined by Comet assays. The results showed that in both the 231-K8ikd and 10A-iK8 cells, the levels of KLF8 expression and the levels of doxorubicin-induced DNA damage were inversely correlated (Fig. 1, E and F). These results were further verified by an independent analysis of the induction of phosphorylated form of histone 2A.X, i.e. γ-H2A.X, a marker for DNA DSBs, using Western blotting (Fig. 1G). These data clearly indicate that the aberrant overexpression of KLF8 in breast cancer cells is critical for the prevention of DNA damage, promotion of DNA repair, or both, and the subsequent resistance to the DNA damage-induced cell death. We have recently identified the KLF8 interaction with and regulation by PARP-1, a master regulator of DNA repair (1.Lord C.J. Ashworth A.

We found that the cells transfected with the wild-type KLF8 showed a much lower level of γH2A.X than that shown in the vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2A, compare lanes or columns 4 and 2), consistent with the observations in the breast cells described above in Fig. 1. In contrast, the cells transfected with the mutant KLF8 maintained a level of γH2A.X that was comparable with that in the vector-transfected control cells and much higher than that in the wild-type KLF8-transfected cells (Fig. 2A, compare lane or column 6 to lanes 2 or 4). These results indicate that the interaction of KLF8 and PARP-1 is critical for the KLF8-induced decrease in the levels of DNA damage in the cells.

The result showed that without PARP-1 re-expression in the cells, overexpression of KLF8 did not cause a reduction in the levels of DNA damage (Fig. 2B, compare lanes or columns 4 and 2). Coexpression of wild-type PARP-1 restored the KLF8-induced reduction in the DNA damage levels, but the mutant PARP-1 failed to do so (Fig. 2A, compare lanes or columns 5 or 6 to 2 or 4), indicating that PARP-1-catalyzed auto-PARylation or trans-PARylation also plays an important role in KLF8 regulation of the DNA damage response. These results suggest that it is important for KLF8 to interact with catalytically active PARP-1 to antagonize DNA damage. The results also suggest that KLF8 reduces the levels of DNA damage primarily by promotin"

Crucial for the initiation of COPII coat assembly is Sec12, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor responsible for activating the small G protein Sar1. Once activated, Sar1/GTP binds to endoplasmic reticulum membranes and recruits COPII coat components (Sec23/24 and Sec13/31). Here, we report the 1.36 Å resolution crystal structure of the catalytically active, 38-kDa cytoplasmic portion of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sec12. Sec12 adopts a β propeller fold. Conserved residues cluster around a loop we term the ""K loop,"" which extends from the N-terminal propeller blade. Structure-guided site-directed mutagenesis, in conjunction with in vitro and in vivo functional studies, reveals that this region of Sec12 is catalytically essential, presumably because it makes direct contact with Sar1. Strikingly, the crystal structure also reveals that a single potassium ion stabilizes the K loop; bound potassium is, moreover, essential for optimum guanine nucleotide exchange activity in vitro. Thus, our results reveal a novel role for a potassium-stabilized loop in catalyzing guanine nucleotide exchange."

Here, we describe a potential role for srGAP3 as a tumor suppressor in mammary epithelial cells. We show that RNAi-mediated depletion of srGAP3 promotes Rac dependent, anchorage-independent growth of partially transformed human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). Furthermore, srGAP3 expression is absent, or significantly reduced in 7/10 breast cancer cell lines compared with normal HMECs. Re-expression of srGAP3 in a subset of these cell lines inhibits both anchorage-independent growth and cell invasion in a GAP-dependent manner, and this is accompanied by an increase in phosphorylation of the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family proteins and myosin light chain 2 (MLC2). Inhibition of the Rho regulated kinase, ROCK, reduces ERM and MLC2 phosphorylation and restores invasion. We conclude that srGAP3 has tumor suppressor-like activity in HMECs, likely through its activity as a negative regulator of Rac1."
https://openalex.org/W2020547501,"Cytokinesis is the final step of cell division. Increasing evidence suggests failure of cytokinesis might contribute to the development of cancer. Here, we demonstrate that the serologically defined colon cancer antigen-3 (SDCCAG3) forms a complex with PTPN13, a protein tyrosine phosphatase known to be involved in the regulation of cytokinesis, carcinogenesis and tumor aggressiveness. We show that SDCCAG3 is a novel endosomal protein, primarily localized at the early/recycling endosomal compartment. SDCCAG3 undergoes dynamic localization during cell division with strong accumulation at the midbody during cytokinesis. Overexpression as well as downregulation correlates with the generation of multinucleate cells. Furthermore, we show interaction of SDCCAG3 with the Arf GTPase activating protein GIT1 (G protein-coupled receptor kinase interactor-1). Overexpression of an ArfGAP-negative version of GIT1 also results in an increased number of multinucleate cells suggesting regulation of Arf-mediated vesicular trafficking or signaling via SDCCAG3. Finally, we demonstrate that SDCCAG3 expression levels are elevated in colon cancers. In summary, we have established SDCCAG3 as a novel endosomal protein, which is involved in the regulation of cytokinesis."
https://openalex.org/W2008111893,"Mutations in the apical Na-K-2Cl co-transporter, NKCC2, cause type I Bartter syndrome, a life-threatening kidney disease. Yet the mechanisms underlying the regulation of NKCC2 trafficking in renal cells are scarcely known. We previously showed that naturally occurring mutations depriving NKCC2 of its distal COOH-terminal tail and interfering with the (1081)LLV(1083) motif result in defects in the ER exit of the co-transporter. Here we show that this motif is necessary but not sufficient for anterograde trafficking of NKCC2. Indeed, we have identified two additional hydrophobic motifs, (1038)LL(1039) and (1048)LI(1049), that are required for ER exit and surface expression of the co-transporter. Double mutations of (1038)LL(1039) or (1048)LI(1049) to di-alanines disrupted glycosylation and cell surface expression of NKCC2, independently of the expression system. Pulse-chase analysis demonstrated that the absence of the terminally glycosylated form of NKCC2 was not due to reduced synthesis or increased rates of degradation of mutant co-transporters, but was instead caused by defects in maturation. Co-immunolocalization experiments revealed that (1038)AA(1039) and (1048)AA(1049) were trapped mainly in the ER as indicated by extensive co-localization with the ER marker calnexin. Remarkably, among several analyzed motifs present in the NKCC2 COOH terminus, only those required for ER exit and surface expression of NKCC2 are evolutionarily conserved in all members of the SLC12A family, a group of cation-chloride co-transporters that are targets of therapeutic drugs and mutated in several human diseases. Based upon these data, we propose abnormal anterograde trafficking as a common mechanism associated with mutations depriving NKCC2, and also all other members of the SLC12A family, of their COOH terminus."

https://openalex.org/W2008139932,"Glutamate metabolism is linked to a number of fundamental metabolic pathways such as amino acid metabolism, the TCA cycle, and glutathione (GSH) synthesis. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, glutamate is synthesized from α-ketoglutarate by two NADP(+)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenases (NADP-GDH) encoded by GDH1 and GDH3. Here, we report the relationship between the function of the NADP-GDH and stress-induced apoptosis. Gdh3-null cells showed accelerated chronological aging and hypersusceptibility to thermal and oxidative stress during stationary phase. Upon exposure to oxidative stress, Gdh3-null strains displayed a rapid loss in viability associated with typical apoptotic hallmarks, i.e. reactive oxygen species accumulation, nuclear fragmentation, DNA breakage, and phosphatidylserine translocation. In addition, Gdh3-null cells, but not Gdh1-null cells, had a higher tendency toward GSH depletion and subsequent reactive oxygen species accumulation than did WT cells. GSH depletion was rescued by exogenous GSH or glutamate. The hypersusceptibility of stationary phase Gdh3-null cells to stress-induced apoptosis was suppressed by deletion of GDH2. Promoter swapping and site-directed mutagenesis of GDH1 and GDH3 indicated that the necessity of GDH3 for the resistance to stress-induced apoptosis and chronological aging is due to the stationary phase-specific expression of GDH3 and concurrent degradation of Gdh1 in which the Lys-426 residue plays an essential role."

Recently, two mutations in human CPA6 were associated with febrile seizures and/or temporal lobe epilepsy. In this study we screened for additional CPA6 mutations in patients with febrile seizures and focal epilepsy, which encompasses the temporal lobe epilepsy subtype. Mutations found from this analysis as well as CPA6 mutations reported in databases of single nucleotide polymorphisms were further screened by analysis of the modeled proCPA6 protein structure and the functional role of the mutated amino acid. The point mutations predicted to affect activity and/or protein folding were tested by expression of the mutant in HEK293 cells and analysis of the resulting CPA6 protein. Common polymorphisms in CPA6 were also included in this analysis. Several mutations resulted in reduced enzyme activity or CPA6 protein levels in the extracellular matrix. The mutants with reduced extracellular CPA6 protein levels showed normal levels of 50-kDa proCPA6 in the cell, and this could be converted into 37-kDa CPA6 by trypsin, suggesting that protein folding was not greatly affected by the mutations. Interestingly, three of the mutations that reduced extracellular CPA6 protein levels were found in patients with epilepsy. Taken together, these results provide further evidence for the involvement of CPA6 mutations in human epilepsy and reveal additional rare mutations that inactivate CPA6 and could, therefore, also be associated with epileptic phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1973862996,"FoxO1 transcription factor controls the glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as cell proliferation and stress response. Akt, activated by insulin and other growth factors, phosphorylates FoxO1 causing its nuclear export and activity suppression. In this manuscript, we show that IL-1β, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, has the opposite effects on FoxO1. IL-1β stimulation of primary rat hepatocytes and HEK293 cells overexpressing the IL-1β receptor (293-IL-1RI) results in increased nuclear and cytosolic FoxO1 protein but not mRNA levels. IL-1β stimulation also elevates the levels of a mutant FoxO1 that is resistant to Akt phosphorylation. This suggests that an Akt-independent mechanism is involved. Co-stimulation with insulin does not affect the IL-1β induction of FoxO1. The IL-1β effects on FoxO1 are counteracted, however, by the silencing or inhibition of neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase-2) using shRNAi, scyphostatin, or GW4869, as well as by the pharmacological inhibition of JNK and ERK. Reversely, the overexpression of nSMase-2 through adenovirus-mediated gene transfer potentiates, in a JNK- and ERK-dependent manner, the IL-1β effects. We also show that transcription of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 mRNA, which requires active FoxO1, is stimulated by IL-1β and is suppressed by the inhibition of nSMase-2 and JNK. In conclusion, we propose that IL-1β regulates FoxO1 activity through a novel nSMase-2-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1990045574,"As colorectal cancer remains the second highest cause of cancer-related deaths in much of the industrialised world, identifying novel strategies to prevent colorectal tumour development remains an important challenge. BAG-1 is a multi-functional protein, the expression of which is up-regulated at relatively early stages in colorectal tumorigenesis. Importantly, BAG-1 is thought to enhance colorectal tumour progression through promoting tumour cell survival. Here, we report for the first time a novel role for BAG-1, establishing it as a suppressor of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β1) expression in colorectal tumour cells. Microarray analysis first highlighted the possibility that BAG-1 may regulate TGF-β1 expression, a key cytokine in normal colonic tissue homoeostasis. Q-RT–PCR and ELISA demonstrated TGFB1 mRNA and protein expression to be significantly increased when BAG1 levels were reduced by small interfering RNA; additionally, induction of BAG-1L caused suppression of TGFB1 mRNA in colorectal tumour cells. Using reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, a direct association of BAG-1 with the TGFB1 gene regulatory region was identified. Immunohistochemistry and Weiser fraction data indicated that the levels of BAG-1 and TGF-β1 are inversely correlated in the normal colonic epithelium in vivo, consistent with a role for BAG-1-mediated repression of TGF-β1 production. In vitro studies showed that the change in TGF-β1 production following manipulation of BAG-1 is functionally relevant; through induction of anchorage-independent growth in TGF-β1-dependent normal rat kidney fibroblasts and regulation of SMAD2 phosphorylation in TGF-β1-sensitive adenoma cells. Taken together, this study identifies the anti-apoptotic protein BAG-1 as a suppressor of the inhibitory growth factor TGF-β1, suggesting that high expression of BAG-1 can impact on a number of the hallmarks of cancer, of potential importance in promoting the early stages of colorectal tumorigenesis. Establishing BAG-1 as a repressor of TGF-β1 has important biological implications, and highlights a new role for BAG-1 in colorectal tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2063164778,"Generated by proteolytic cleavage of immunoglobulin, Fab fragments possess great promise as blocking reagents, able to bind receptors or other targets without inducing cross-linking. However, aggregation of Fab preparations is a common occurrence, which generates intrinsic stimulatory capacity and thwarts signal blockade strategies. Using a panel of biochemical approaches, including size exclusion chromatography, SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry, and cell stimulation followed by flow cytometry, we have measured the oligomerization and acquisition of stimulatory capacity that occurs in four monoclonal IgG Fabs specific for TCR/CD3. Unexpectedly, we observed that all Fabs spontaneously formed complexes that were precisely bivalent, and these bivalent complexes possessed most of the stimulatory activity of each Fab preparation. Fabs composing bivalent complexes were more susceptible to proteolysis than monovalent Fabs, indicating a difference in conformation between the Fabs involved in these two different states of valency. Because osmolytes represent a class of compounds that stabilize protein folding and conformation, we sought to determine the extent to which the amino acid osmolyte l-proline might impact bivalent Fab complexation. We found that l-proline (i) inhibited the adoption of the conformation associated with bivalent complexation, (ii) preserved Fab monovalency, (iii) reversed the conformation of preformed bivalent Fabs to that of monovalent Fabs, and (iv) separated a significant percentage of preformed bivalent complexes into monovalent species. Thus, Fab fragments can adopt a conformation that is compatible with folding or packing of a bivalent complex in a process that can be inhibited by osmolytes."

The hydrophilic peripheral arm is projected into the mitochondrial matrix/bacterial cytoplasm and houses all the cofactors (one flavin mononucleotide and eight to nine iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters) that may participate in the electron transfer (11.Hinchliffe P.

The transfer of electron from NADH starts at the tip of the peripheral arm with FMN being the primary electron acceptor and then through a chain of seven conserved Fe/S clusters to the likely quinone-binding site expected to be present at the interface with the membrane domain (11.Hinchliffe P.

For functional study of complex I/NDH-1, it is a prerequisite to clarify sites and mechanism of the proton translocation. The stoichiometry of the proton translocation in NDH-1/complex I is considered to be four H+ per NADH oxidized (19.Galkin A.S. Grivennikova V.G. Vinogradov A.D. →H+/2e− stoichiometry in NADH-quinone reductase reactions catalyzed by bovine heart submitochondrial particles.FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that under certain conditions H+/2e− of complex I are decreased to three (2.Wikström M. Hummer G. Stoichiometry of proton translocation by respiratory complex I and its mechanistic implications.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 4431-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These suggest that complex I/NDH-1 contains maximum of four proton translocation sites. The three-dimensional structural model revealed a common topology for three Na+/H+ antiporter-like subunits (NuoL (ND5), NuoM (ND4), and NuoN (ND2)) that are located side by side (10.Efremov R.G.

These three subunits are considered to be good candidates for the proton translocation sites. In fact, biochemical and mutation analyses strongly suggest that NuoL and NuoM are involved in the proton translocation (23.Torres-Bacete J. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T.

Recent research on the efficiency of proton translocation indicates that NDH-1/complex I lacking both NuoL and NuoM can pump protons at H+/2e− = 2 (27.Steimle S. Bajzath C. Dörner K. Schulte M.

These data suggest that in addition to NuoL, NuoM, and NuoN, one additional proton translocation site is present in NDH-1/complex I. It seems likely that at least one of the four remaining hydrophobic subunits (NuoA, NuoJ, NuoK, and NuoH) participates in the proton translocation. The three-dimensional structural model confirmed our earlier prediction that the hydrophobic subunits NuoA, NuoJ, and NuoK form a multisubunit helix bundle similar to subunits NuoL, NuoM, and NuoN and are in contact with the hydrophilic domain subunits NuoCD and NuoB at the quinone-binding interface (29.Efremov R.G.

Subunit NuoK (counterpart of the mitochondrial ND4L subunit) is the smallest subunit of NDH-1 and is proposed to show sequence similarity to the MrpC subunit of the multisubunit Na+/H+ antiporters (37.Mathiesen C. Hägerhäll C. The “antiporter module” of respiratory chain complex I includes the MrpC/NuoK subunit–a revision of the modular evolution scheme.FEBS Lett. 2003; 549: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structural model shows that the NuoK subunit spans the membrane with three linearly arranged α-helices, connected by short loops. The subunit was also shown to have extensive interaction with the NuoN subunit with its C terminus extending between NuoN and helix HL (an α-helix of NuoL that spans multiple subunits in the membrane domain anchoring near NuoN), forming many inter-subunit links (29.Efremov R.G. Sazanov L.A. Structure of the membrane domain of respiratory complex I.Nature. 2011; 476: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Previously, Kervinen et al. (38.Kervinen M. Pätsi J. Finel M. Hassinen I.E. A pair of membrane-embedded acidic residues in the NuoK subunit of Escherichia coli NDH-1, a counterpart of the ND4L subunit of the mitochondrial Complex I, are required for high ubiquinone reductase activity.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and Kao et al. (31.Kao M.C. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Characterization of the membrane domain subunit NuoK (ND4L) of the NADH-quinone oxidoreductase from Escherichia coli.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9545-9554Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have reported that two conserved glutamic residues located in adjacent TMs of NuoK are important for the energy coupled activity of NDH-1. In particular, mutation of highly conserved KGlu-36 in TM2 to Ala/Gln led to a complete loss of the NDH-1 activities, whereas mutation of the other conserved Glu, KGlu-72 in TM3, caused moderate reduction in the activities (31.Kao M.C. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Characterization of the membrane domain subunit NuoK (ND4L) of the NADH-quinone oxidoreductase from Escherichia coli.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9545-9554Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Kervinen et al. (38.Kervinen M. Pätsi J. Finel M. Hassinen I.E. A pair of membrane-embedded acidic residues in the NuoK subunit of Escherichia coli NDH-1, a counterpart of the ND4L subunit of the mitochondrial Complex I, are required for high ubiquinone reductase activity.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) also observed a severely impaired electron transfer activity and cell growth when these two glutamates of the Escherichia coli NDH-1 were mutated. To clarify the mechanism of proton translocation of NDH-1, we have investigated the importance of a specific location of both carboxylic residues, KGlu-36 and KGlu-72, in the NuoK subunit. Earlier, we have also shown that a double mutant of the two arginine residues (R25A/R26A) located in a small loop (loop-1) between TM1 and TM2 had a drastic effect on activities, with greatly reduced electron transfer rates and a diminished electrochemical gradient (31.Kao M.C. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Characterization of the membrane domain subunit NuoK (ND4L) of the NADH-quinone oxidoreductase from Escherichia coli.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9545-9554Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, we have further probed the role of the short cytoplasmic side loop (25RRN27) of this smallest subunit of NDH-1. PCR product, DNA gel extraction, and plasmid purification kits were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The endonucleases were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange®II XL kit), the Herculase® Enhanced DNA polymerase, and the pCRScript vector were purchased from Stratagene (Cedar Creek, TX). The pKO3 vector was generously provided by Dr. George M. Church (Harvard Medical School, Boston). p-Nitro blue tetrazolium was from EMD Bioesciences (La Jolla, CA). Sigma was the major source of all other chemicals, including dNADH, NADH, and the antibiotics. E. coli MC4100 (F−, araD139, Δ(arg F-lac)U169, ptsF25, relA1, flb5301, rpsL 150.λ−) was used to generate nuoK site-specific mutations. The strategy used to obtain the NuoK mutants was essentially the same as reported previously (31.Kao M.C. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Characterization of the membrane domain subunit NuoK (ND4L) of the NADH-quinone oxidoreductase from Escherichia coli.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9545-9554Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In summary, pCRScript(nuoKE36A) and pCRScript(nuoKE72A) previously obtained in our laboratory (31.Kao M.C. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Characterization of the membrane domain subunit NuoK (ND4L) of the NADH-quinone oxidoreductase from Escherichia coli.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9545-9554Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were used as template to generate the NuoK EAE mutants. All other NuoK mutants were made using pCRScript(nuoK) as the template. The mutated nuoK fragments were then cloned in pKO3/nuoK-T generating pKO3(nuoK mutants) or pKO3(nuoKEAE mutants). The above pKO3 plasmids were then used to replace the spc gene for the mutated nuoK genes in the NuoK KO in E. coli chromosome as described earlier (31.Kao M.C. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Characterization of the membrane domain subunit NuoK (ND4L) of the NADH-quinone oxidoreductase from Escherichia coli.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9545-9554Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The mutations were finally confirmed by PCR and sequencing using specific oligonucleotides. E. coli NuoK mutants were grown, and inverted membrane vesicles were prepared according to the method described previously in our laboratory (14.Sinha P.K. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Torres-Bacete J. Sato M.

The above antibodies were used to analyze the content of the NDH-1 subunits by Western blotting. The procedures for performing blue-native PAGE (BN-PAGE) has been described earlier (42.Sinha P.K.

Chem. 2009; 284: 9814-9823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In BN-PAGE, certain mutants were sensitive to detergent extraction. We performed the extraction using 0.5 or 1.0% dodecyl maltoside as indicated in the figure legend. The assembly of NDH-1 was examined by NADH dehydrogenase activity staining as reported (42.Sinha P.K. Torres-Bacete J. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Castro-Guerrero N. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T.

The activity analysis of different NDH-1 mutants was performed using membrane vesicles according to the method described previously (43.Yagi T. Purification and characterization of NADH dehydrogenase complex from Paracoccus denitrificans.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 250: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, the dNADH-K3Fe(CN)6 reductase activity was performed at 30 °C with 80 μg of protein/ml in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA containing 10 mm KCN, and 1 mm K3Fe(CN)6. The samples were preincubated for 1 min before starting the reaction with the addition of 150 μm dNADH. The signal was followed at 420 nm. K3Fe(CN)6 was replaced by 50 μm DB as an electron acceptor, and the signal was monitored at 340 nm for the dNADH-DB reductase activity in the same buffer. Similarly, 50 μm UQ1 was used to measure the dNADH-UQ1 reductase activity. Capsaicin-40 was added to inhibit the reaction (44.Satoh T. Miyoshi H. Sakamoto K. Iwamura H. Comparison of the inhibitory action of synthetic capsaicin analogs with various NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductases.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The dNADH oxidase activity was measured under the same conditions minus KCN and DB. The extinction coefficients used for activity calculations were ϵ340 = 6.22 mm−1 cm−1 for dNADH and ϵ420 = 1.00 mm−1 cm−1 for K3Fe(CN)6. Apart from the usual pH 7.0, the dNADH oxidase, dNADH-DB, and dNADH-UQ1 reductase activities were also monitored at various pH values for some of the NuoK mutants as described under “Results.” The NDH-1 proton pump activity was followed by ACMA fluorescence quenching using 200 μm dNADH as the substrate (45.Amarneh B. Vik S.B. Mutagenesis of subunit N of the Escherichia coli complex I. Identification of the initiation codon and the sensitivity of mutants to decylubiquinone.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4800-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All activity measurements were done 2–3 times. The BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard was used to determine the protein concentrations according to the manufacturer's instructions. Any variations from the procedures and details are described in the figure legends. The NuoK subunit is one of the least conserved subunits of NDH-1. This subunit has been speculated to also show sequence similarity to the MrpC subunit of the multisubunit Na+/H+ antiporters (Fig. 1A) (37.Mathiesen C. Hägerhäll C. The “antiporter module” of respiratory chain complex I includes the MrpC/NuoK subunit–a revision of the modular evolution scheme.FEBS Lett. 2003; 549: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Two Glu residues in subunit NuoK, KGlu-36 and KGlu-72, are present in the middle of TM2 and TM3, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). KGlu-36 is perfectly conserved among all species, and KGlu-72 is almost perfectly conserved. However, neither one is conserved in the MrpC subunit of the multisubunit Na+/H+ antiporters (Fig. 1A) (34.Kao M.C. Di Bernardo S. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T.

https://openalex.org/W2064278705,"Nitric-oxide synthase, a cytochrome P450-like hemoprotein enzyme, catalyzes the synthesis of nitric oxide, a critical signaling molecule in a variety of physiological processes. Our laboratory has discovered that certain drugs suicide-inactivate neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) and lead to the preferential ubiquitination of the inactivated nNOS by an Hsp70- and CHIP (C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein)-dependent process. To further understand the process by which altered nNOS is recognized, ubiquitinated, and proteasomally degraded, we examined the sites of ubiquitination on nNOS. We utilized an in vitro ubiquitination system containing purified E1, E2 (UbcH5a), Hsp70, and CHIP that recapitulates the ability of the cells to selectively recognize and ubiquitinate the altered forms of nNOS. LC-MS/MS analysis of the tryptic peptides obtained from the in vitro ubiquitinated nNOS identified 12 ubiquitination sites. Nine of the sites were within the oxygenase domain and two were in the calmodulin-binding site, which links the oxygenase and reductase domains, and one site was in the reductase domain. Mutational analysis of the lysines in the calmodulin-binding site revealed that Lys-739 is a major site for poly-ubiquitination of nNOS in vitro and regulates, in large part, the CHIP-dependent degradation of nNOS in HEK293 cells, as well as in in vitro studies with fraction II. Elucidating the exact site of ubiquitination is an important step in understanding how chaperones recognize and trigger degradation of nNOS."
