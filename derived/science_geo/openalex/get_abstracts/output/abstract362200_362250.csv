https://openalex.org/W2153411657,"Some of the most common causes of blindness involve the degeneration of photoreceptors in the neural retina; photoreceptor replacement therapy might restore some vision in these individuals. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) could, in principle, provide a source of photoreceptors to repair the retina. We have previously shown that retinal progenitors can be efficiently derived from human ESCs. We now show that retinal cells derived from human ESCs will migrate into mouse retinas following intraocular injection, settle into the appropriate layers, and express markers for differentiated cells, including both rod and cone photoreceptor cells. After transplantation of the cells into the subretinal space of adult Crx−/− mice (a model of Leber's Congenital Amaurosis), the hESC-derived retinal cells differentiate into functional photoreceptors and restore light responses to the animals. These results demonstrate that hESCs can, in principle, be used for photoreceptor replacement therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2092015664,"<h2>Summary</h2> Histone modifications have been implicated in stem cell maintenance and differentiation. We have analyzed genome-wide changes in gene expression and histone modifications during differentiation of multipotent human primary hematopoietic stem cells/progenitor cells (HSCs/HPCs) into erythrocyte precursors. Our data indicate that H3K4me1, H3K9me1, and H3K27me1 associate with enhancers of differentiation genes prior to their activation and correlate with basal expression, suggesting that these monomethylations are involved in the maintenance of activation potential required for differentiation. In addition, although the majority of genes associated with both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in HSCs/HPCs become silent and lose H3K4me3 after differentiation, those that lose H3K27me3 and become activated after differentiation are associated with increased levels of H2A.Z, H3K4me1, H3K9me1, H4K20me1, and RNA polymerase II in HSCs/HPCs. Thus, our data suggest that gene expression changes during differentiation are programmed by chromatin modifications present at the HSC/HPC stage and provide a resource for enhancer and promoter identification."

We have defined a critical role of p53 in regulating hematopoietic stem cell quiescence, especially in promoting the enhanced quiescence seen in HSCs that lack the MEF/ELF4 transcription factor. Transcription profiling of HSCs isolated from wild-type and p53 null mice identified Gfi-1 and Necdin as p53 target genes, and using lentiviral vectors to upregulate or knockdown the expression of these genes, we show their importance in regulating HSC quiescence. Establishing the role of p53 (and its target genes) in controlling the cell-cycle entry of HSCs may lead to therapeutic strategies capable of eliminating quiescent cancer (stem) cells.

Establishing the role of p53 (and its target genes) in controlling the cell-cycle entry of HSCs may lead to therapeutic strategies capable of eliminating quiescent cancer (stem) cells. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can remain quiescent or they can enter the cell cycle and either self-renew or differentiate into multiple lineages. Although relatively quiescent, the HSC population must give rise to a hierarchy of differentiating progenitor cell populations that can replenish the blood system each day (Attar and Scadden, 2004Attar E.C. Scadden D.T. Regulation of hematopoietic stem cell growth.Leukemia. 2004; 18: 1760-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Blood cell production must also respond efficiently to hematologic stresses, such as blood loss, infection, or exposure to cytotoxic agents, via expansion of the HSC and/or progenitor cell populations (Passegué et al., 2005Passegué E. Wagers A.J. Giuriato S. Anderson W.C. Weissman I.L. Global analysis of proliferation and cell cycle gene expression in the regulation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell fates.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 1599-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). These processes must occur without depleting the stem cell pool (Venezia et al., 2004Venezia T.A. Merchant A.A. Ramos C.A.

HSC quiescence is likely controlled by both HSC-intrinsic mechanisms and bone marrow microenvironmental factors (Wilson and Trumpp, 2006Wilson A. Trumpp A.

Several transcription factors have been shown to play key roles in HSC-fate decisions. Gfi-1 has been shown to restrict HSC proliferation and preserve HSC functional integrity (Hock et al., 2004Hock H. Hamblen M.J. Rooke H.M. Schindler J.W. Saleque S. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H.

HOXB4 and GATA-2 regulate HSC self-renewal (Krosl et al., 2003Krosl J. Austin P. Beslu N. Kroon E. Humphries R.K. Sauvageau G.

Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 871-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), whereas the Ets transcription factor MEF/ELF4 regulates both HSC self-renewal and quiescence (Lacorazza et al., 2006Lacorazza H.D. Yamada T. Liu Y. Miyata Y. Sivina M. Nunes J. Nimer S.D.

Mef null mice exhibit greater numbers of HSCs (i.e., LSK cells), and Mef null LSK cells are more quiescent than normal. Early studies suggested a role for p21 in restricting HSC entry into the cell cycle and regulating HSC pool size and HSC exhaustion under stress (Cheng et al., 2000Cheng T. Rodrigues N. Shen H. Yang Y. Dombkowski D. Sykes M. Scadden D.T. Hematopoietic stem cell quiescence maintained by p21cip1/waf1.Science. 2000; 287: 1804-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). However, the regulation of HSC self-renewal by p21 under steady-state conditions may be minimal (van Os et al., 2007van Os R. Kamminga L.M. Ausema A. Bystrykh L.V. Draijer D.P. van Pelt K.

Although hematopoiesis in p53 knockout mice appears to proceed normally, numerous studies have identified roles for p53 in the proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and aging of hematopoietic cells (Shounan et al., 1996Shounan Y.

The impact of altered p53 dosage on hematopoietic stem cell dynamics during aging.Blood. 2007; 109: 1736-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Moreover, p53 deletions and mutations have been found at high frequency in blast crisis chronic myelogenous leukemia and with some frequency in acute leukemia (Prokocimer and Rotter, 1994Prokocimer M. Rotter V. Structure and function of p53 in normal cells and their aberrations in cancer cells: projection on the hematologic cell lineages.Blood. 1994; 84: 2391-2411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage, p53 can either elicit cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis, the typical outcome for mature hematopoietic cells (Wu et al., 2005Wu W.S. Heinrichs S. Xu D. Garrison S.P. Zambetti G.P. Adams J.M. Look A.T. Slug antagonizes p53-mediated apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitors by repressing puma.Cell. 2005; 123: 641-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). But p53 has recently been shown to negatively regulate neural stem cell proliferation and self-renewal (Meletis et al., 2006Meletis K. Wirta V. Hede S.M. Nistér M. Lundeberg J. Frisén J. p53 suppresses the self-renewal of adult neural stem cells.Development. 2006; 133: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and given that long-term reconstituting HSCs (LT-HSC) express high levels of p53 transcripts (Forsberg et al., 2005Forsberg E.C. Prohaska S.S. Katzman S. Heffner G.C. Stuart J.M. Weissman I.L. Differential expression of novel potential regulators in hematopoietic stem cells.PloS Genet. 2005; 1: e28https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.0010028Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar and our data, see below), we examined the function of p53 during steady-state hematopoiesis. We find an important interdependency between MEF/ELF4 and p53 on HSC quiescence and identify two p53 target genes, Gfi-1 and Necdin, that regulate quiescence in wild-type (and Mef null) HSCs. Our findings identify distinct roles for p53 in resting versus cycling cells. We have recently found that Mef/Elf4 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mefs) accumulate p53 protein and undergo premature senescence, which appears to be due to the ability of Mef to directly upregulate Mdm2 expression (G.S., Y.L., S.E.E., Y.M., K. Ohyashiki, S.M., S.D.N., unpublished data). We hypothesized that p53 could play a role in the enhanced stem cell quiescence (or the increased HSC frequency) seen in Mef null mice, so we examined p53 mRNA expression in primitive Lin–Sca-1+c-Kit+ (LSK) cells and in various myeloid progenitor cells (CMP, GMP, and MEP). p53 is most highly expressed in LSK cells (Figure S1 available online), suggesting that it could play an important role in HSC physiology. We then examined the cell-cycle status of p53−/− Lin–Sca-1+ cells using Pyronin Y and Hoechst 33342 staining and observed a reduction of Pyronin Ylow cells, indicating the presence of fewer quiescent HSCs (p < 0.005, Figure 1A). Using the SP phenotype as a marker for quiescent HSCs in adult bone marrow (Goodell et al., 1996Goodell M.A. Brose K. Paradis G. Conner A.S. Mulligan R.C. Isolation and functional properties of murine hematopoietic stem cells that are replicating in vivo.J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1797-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (2411) Google Scholar, Arai et al., 2004Arai F. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Sato H. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Ito K. Koh G.Y. Suda T. Tie2/angiopoietin-1 signaling regulates hematopoietic stem cell quiescence in the bone marrow niche.Cell. 2004; 118: 149-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar), we also found a 2-fold decrease in the frequency of CD34–LSK SP cells in the absence of p53 (p < 0.003, Figure 1B). Staining of p53 null CD34–LSK cells with the proliferation marker Ki67 also showed enhanced HSC proliferation with fewer quiescent cells present (p < 0.001, Figure 1C). Furthermore, to determine the proliferative rate of p53 −/− CD34−LSK cells in vivo, we administered BrdU to mice orally for 2 days and isolated CD34−LSK cells from the bone marrow. While ∼30% of wild-type CD34−LSK cells incorporated BrdU over this period, ∼60% of the p53 −/− CD34−LSK cells were BrdU positive (Figure 1D, p < 0.01; and Figure S2). These data suggest that p53 promotes HSC quiescence, and in its absence, HSCs more easily enter the cell cycle. Given the HSC phenotype of the p53 null mice and the upregulation of p53 in Mef null fibroblasts, we generated p53−/−Mef−/− mice to determine both the frequency and the cell-cycle status of the hematopoietic stem (and progenitor) cells. Loss of MEF alone, p53 alone, or both MEF and p53 increased the frequency of LSK cells (2- to 3-fold) compared to wild-type mice (Figure 2A). This small but consistent increase in HSC frequency was confirmed using the SLAM cell surface makers, as we also observed a consistent 2-fold increase in the frequency of CD150+CD41−CD48−Sca-1+c-kit+Lin− cells (LT-HSCs) in the bone marrow of mice lacking MEF, p53, or both MEF and p53 compared to wild-type mice (Figure 2B). The increased HSC numbers could be due to enhanced self-renewal or to decreased apoptosis. We evaluated cell survival by Annexin-V staining and found no significant difference in the number of apoptotic (Annexin-V+/PI–) HSCs in the wild-type and p53−/−Mef−/− mice at steady state (Figure 2C). Thus, the increase in HSCs appears to be due to enhanced self-renewal. To define how loss of p53 (and MEF) affects HSC behavior, we performed in vitro (cobblestone area-forming cell [CAFC], long-term culture-initiating cell [LTC-IC], and serial replating assays) and in vivo (serial bone marrow transplantation and competitive repopulation) functional assays. p53−/− bone marrow cells contain 5-fold more CAFCs compared to wild-type bone marrow cells, and this increased CAFC frequency is also seen in p53−/−Mef−/− bone marrow (Figure 3A). Similar findings were seen in the LTC-IC assay, as p53−/− LSK cells formed 5-fold more colonies than did wild-type LSK cells. However, the Mef−/− and the p53−/−Mef−/− LSK cells formed 10-fold more colonies than the wild-type LSK cells (Figure 3B). In the serial replating assay, which assesses the preservation of “stemness” in the progenitor cell compartment, wild-type BMMCs cannot be replated more than three times. Hematopoietic progenitor cells that lack Mef show increased serial replating in CFU assays, confirming our earlier findings (Lacorazza et al., 2006Lacorazza H.D. Yamada T. Liu Y. Miyata Y. Sivina M. Nunes J. Nimer S.D. The transcription factor MEF/ELF4 regulates the quiescence of primitive hematopoietic cells.Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 175-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and so do the p53−/− and the p53−/−Mef−/− BMMCs (Figure 3C). Thus, loss of p53 showed effects in wild-type HSCs but no detrimental effect on HSC frequency in the Mef null background in any of these in vitro assays. To assess whether the accumulation of HSCs in p53−/−Mef−/− mice reflects increased self-renewal, we began serial bone marrow transplant (sBMT) assays using BMMCs from each genotype (wild-type, p53−/−, Mef−/−, p53−/−Mef−/−, C57BL/6, and CD45.2) of mice as donor cells and lethally irradiated mice (CD45.1) as recipients. However, most of the recipient mice transplanted with p53−/− BMMCs died within 4 months posttransplant due to the development of lymphomas, and although recipient mice transplanted with p53−/−Mef−/− BMMCs lived longer, most of them died within 5 months of transplantation. Thus, we could not perform serial bone marrow transplantation. Instead, we performed competitive repopulating experiments, transplanting 1000 LSK cells of each genotype (wild-type, p53−/−, Mef−/−, p53−/−Mef −/−, and CD45.2) into lethally irradiated (9.5 Gy) B6.SJL recipient mice (CD45.1) along with a constant, small dose (5 × 105) of competitor marrow cells (CD45.1). At 16 weeks posttransplantation, the repopulating abilities of both the Mef−/− and p53−/−Mef−/− cells were many fold higher than the wild-type cells, while loss of p53 had a modest effect on competitive repopulating ability (Figure 3D). To further assess HSC frequency, we performed long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) assays, under limiting dilution conditions, a stringent assay that correlates with the in vivo repopulating potential of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells (Ploemacher et al., 1991Ploemacher R.E. van der Sluijs J.P. van Beurden C.A. Baert M.R. Chan P.L. Use of limiting-dilution type long-term marrow cultures in frequency analysis of marrow-repopulating and spleen colony-forming hematopoietic stem cells in the mouse.Blood. 1991; 78: 2527-2533PubMed Google Scholar). The increased frequencies of primitive HSCs in Mef−/−, p53−/−, or p53−/−Mef−/− mice were also evident in the LTC-IC assay (Figure 3E). Thus, the enhanced self-renewal potential of Mef−/− HSCs is not dependent on the presence of p53. We assessed HSC quiescence in the various genetic backgrounds under homeostatic conditions and confirmed the increased quiescence of Mef null HSCs (Figure 4A). We observed a small but consistent decrease in the quiescence of p53−/− HSCs but found that the enhanced quiescence of Mef null HSCs was abrogated by the absence of p53 (analyzing the p53−/−Mef−/− mice). By using the SP phenotype as a marker for quiescent HSCs in adult bone marrow (Arai et al., 2004Arai F. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Sato H. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Ito K. Koh G.Y. Suda T. Tie2/angiopoietin-1 signaling regulates hematopoietic stem cell quiescence in the bone marrow niche.Cell. 2004; 118: 149-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar), we found that p53 loss not only leads to a 2-fold decrease in CD34–LSK SP cells in wild-type mice (Figure 1B), but that its absence in Mef null CD34–LSK SP cells returns the frequency of these cells in the bone marrow to normal (Figure 4B). Thus, p53 is required for the enhanced stem cell quiescence seen in Mef null mice. Mef null bone marrow is relatively resistant to radiation (and chemotherapy), an effect that we attributed to the enhanced HSC quiescence (Lacorazza et al., 2006Lacorazza H.D. Yamada T. Liu Y. Miyata Y. Sivina M. Nunes J. Nimer S.D. The transcription factor MEF/ELF4 regulates the quiescence of primitive hematopoietic cells.Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 175-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of both Mef and p53 loss on the response of HSCs to total body irradiation (6.5 Gy), we harvested bone marrow cells 12 hr postirradiation and assayed for apoptosis of LSK cells by Annexin-V staining. As expected, LSK cells from both the p53−/− mice and the Mef−/− mice showed decreased apoptosis after radiation. However, LSK cells from the p53−/−Mef−/− mice exhibited normal radiation-induced apoptosis (Figure 4C), implying that abrogating the enhanced HSC quiescence in the Mef−/− mice is more important in defining radio-sensitivity than is abrogating p53-dependent apoptosis. As phosphorylation of histone H2AX (γ-H2AX) is an indicator of DNA damage (Rossi et al., 2007Rossi D.J. Bryder D. Seita J. Nussenzweig A. Hoeijmakers J. Weissman I.L. Deficiencies in DNA damage repair limit the function of haematopoietic stem cells with age.Nature. 2007; 447: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar), we irradiated wild-type, p53−/−, Mef−/−, and p53−/−Mef−/− mice (2 Gy) and quantified the number of γ-H2AX foci in individual HSCs using immunostaining. We found that HSCs from Mef−/− mice were largely devoid of γ-H2AX foci (15% cells stain positive for 3–5 foci of γ-H2AX and none for >5 foci), while more than 30% of the HSCs from wild-type, p53−/−, and p53−/−Mef−/− mice stained positively for γ-H2AX (Figure 4D). These data further indicate that the relative radioresistance of HSCs from Mef−/− mice, like the enhanced quiescence, requires the presence of p53. p21 is a major target gene of p53, and in the absence of p21, HSC numbers and proliferation are reported to be increased, leading to stem cell exhaustion following serial bone marrow transplantation (Cheng et al., 2000Cheng T. Rodrigues N. Shen H. Yang Y. Dombkowski D. Sykes M. Scadden D.T. Hematopoietic stem cell quiescence maintained by p21cip1/waf1.Science. 2000; 287: 1804-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). As Mef null LSK cells show increased quiescence, we first examined whether p21 expression is upregulated in Mef−/− HSCs and could account for their enhanced quiescence (and for the effect that loss of p53 has on HSC quiescence). Real-time PCR analysis determined that the level of p21 expression is several-fold higher in Mef−/− HSCs than in wild-type HSCs; p27 is modestly upregulated and p16 is downregulated (Figure 5A). We then generated p21−/−Mef−/− mice, which are viable, born at normal Mendelian frequency, and appear grossly normal. Based on Pyronin Y and Hoechst 33342 staining, we found no effect of p21 loss on the enhanced HSC quiescence generated by the lack of Mef (Figure 5B). Furthermore, the aberrantly high proportion of noncycling (Ki67–) LSK cells seen in the Mef−/− mice was also seen in the p21−/−Mef−/− mice (Figure 5C and Figure S3). Thus, the increased quiescence of Mef null HSCs is not dependent on p21. To further address whether the relative radioresistance of the Mef null HSCs reflected their quiescence status, we irradiated wild-type, p21−/−, Mef−/−, and p21−/−Mef−/− mice (2 Gy) and quantified the number of γ-H2AX foci in individual HSCs. HSCs from both Mef−/− and p21−/−Mef−/− mice had many fewer γ-H2AX foci than HSCs from either wild-type or p21−/− mice (Figure 5D). Thus, the relative radioresistance of HSCs in Mef−/− mice, like the enhanced quiescence, does not require the presence of p21. The quiescent state of Mef null HSCs is p53 dependent but p21 independent, which implies that other p53 target genes are involved in maintaining stem cell quiescence. To identify such p53 targets, we performed transcript profiling (using microarray studies and quantitative real-time PCR analysis) to compare gene expression in LSK cells isolated from wild-type, p53−/−, and p53−/−Mef−/− mice. We also utilized Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software to group potential p53 target genes into specific pathways that may be important in HSC behavior. We identified several putative p53 target genes (that are differentially expressed in both p53−/− and p53−/−Mef−/− cells compared to wild-type cells) and several signaling pathways that appear to be altered in the absence of p53 (Figure 6A and Figure S6). Two genes drew our initial attention: Gfi-1 and Necdin. Gfi-1 (growth factor independent-1) is a zinc finger containing a transcriptional repressor that has been shown to restrict HSC proliferation and preserve HSC functional integrity (Hock et al., 2004Hock H.

Necdin is another growth suppressor. It acts as a negative cell-cycle regulator in postmitotic neurons and contributes to their permanent mitotic arrest (Hu et al., 2003Hu B. Wang S. Zhang Y.

We first confirmed the marked increase of Gfi-1 and Necdin mRNA in Mef−/− LSK cells by real-time PCR analysis (shown in Figure 6B). To determine whether Gfi-1 and Necdin are direct targets of p53, we scrutinized the DNA sequence of the mouse and human Gfi-1 and Necdin genes and found two conserved potential p53 binding sites (p53 RE1 and p53 RE2) in the Gfi-1 promoter and one conserved p53 binding site in the Necdin promoter. To assess whether any of these sites are essential for p53-mediated activation, each site was individually mutated in a luciferase reporter plasmid: p53 strongly transactivated the Necdin promoter, and point mutations in the consensus p53 binding site abolished p53-mediated promoter activation (Figure 6C). p53 also transactivated the Gfi-1 promoter 5-fold. Mutations in the p53 RE1, but not the p53 RE2, abolished p53-mediated Gfi-1 promoter activation, implying that only the p53 RE1 is required for the p53 responsiveness of the Gfi-1 promoter. Next, to determine whether endogenous p53 is bound to the Gfi-1 and Necdin promoters in vivo, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChiP) assays and observed binding of p53 to both the Gfi-1 and Necdin promoters in Lin– bone marrow cells (Figure 6D). Thus, p53 directly binds the Gfi-1 and Necdin promoters and activates their expression. To examine whether Gfi-1 and Necdin are responsible for the enhanced quiescence of Mef null HSCs, we acutely lowered their expression in Lin–Sca-1+ cells, using siRNA. First, we reduced the level of both Gfi-1 and Necdin mRNA and found significant reduction in the quiescence of the Mef−/− HSCs cells (Figure 6E), indicating that these p53 target genes are functionally important in HSCs. While Gfi-1 is a known regulator of HSC proliferation (Hock et al., 2004Hock H. Hamblen M.J. Rooke H.M. Schindler J.W. Saleque S. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Gfi-1 restricts proliferation and preserves functional integrity of hematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2004; 431: 1002-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), the function of Necdin in regulating quiescence in normal HSCs has not been described. To further investigate its role in HSC biology, we measured Necdin mRNA levels in LSK cells (and in a variety of committed myeloid progenitor cells); Only the LSK cells had significant Necdin expression (Figure S7). Then, we reduced Necdin expression in wild-type Lin–Sca-1+ cells using siRNA and also overexpressed Necdin in Lin–Sca-1+ cells using lentiviral gene transfer. HSC quiescence decreased when Necdin was knocked down and increased when we overexpressed Necdin (based on the percentage of Lin–Sca-1+ cells in the G0 phase of the cell cycle, Figures 7A and 7B). Thus, Necdin appears to be a true regulator of HSC quiescence. To examine if Necdin also regulates HSC self-renewal, we knocked-down Necdin expression in mouse bone marrow cells using lentivirally expressed shRNA and performed in vitro serial replating assays. The downregulation of Necdin in wild-type bone marrow cells significantly i"

Adult gastrointestinal tract encounters numerous stimulations, and impaired tissue regeneration may lead to inflammatory diseases and cancer. Intestinal stem cells in adult Drosophila have recently been identified and shown to replenish the various cell types within the midgut. However, it is not known whether these intestinal stem cells can respond to environmental challenges. By feeding dextran sulfate sodium and bleomycin to flies and by expressing apoptotic proteins, we show that Drosophila intestinal stem cells can increase the rate of division in response to tissue damage. Moreover, if tissue damage results in epithelial cell loss, the newly formed enteroblasts can differentiate into mature epithelial cells. By using this newly established system of intestinal stem cell proliferation and tissue regeneration, we find that the insulin receptor signaling pathway is required for intestinal stem cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2032309414,"Background Flashbacks are the hallmark symptom of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Although we have successful treatments for full-blown PTSD, early interventions are lacking. We propose the utility of developing a ‘cognitive vaccine’ to prevent PTSD flashback development following exposure to trauma. Our theory is based on two key findings: 1) Cognitive science suggests that the brain has selective resources with limited capacity; 2) The neurobiology of memory suggests a 6-hr window to disrupt memory consolidation. The rationale for a ‘cognitive vaccine’ approach is as follows: Trauma flashbacks are sensory-perceptual, visuospatial mental images. Visuospatial cognitive tasks selectively compete for resources required to generate mental images. Thus, a visuospatial computer game (e.g. “Tetris”) will interfere with flashbacks. Visuospatial tasks post-trauma, performed within the time window for memory consolidation, will reduce subsequent flashbacks. We predicted that playing “Tetris” half an hour after viewing trauma would reduce flashback frequency over 1-week. Methodology/Principal Findings The Trauma Film paradigm was used as a well-established experimental analog for Post-traumatic Stress. All participants viewed a traumatic film consisting of scenes of real injury and death followed by a 30-min structured break. Participants were then randomly allocated to either a no-task or visuospatial (“Tetris”) condition which they undertook for 10-min. Flashbacks were monitored for 1-week. Results indicated that compared to the no-task condition, the “Tetris” condition produced a significant reduction in flashback frequency over 1-week. Convergent results were found on a clinical measure of PTSD symptomatology at 1-week. Recognition memory between groups did not differ significantly. Conclusions/Significance Playing “Tetris” after viewing traumatic material reduces unwanted, involuntary memory flashbacks to that traumatic film, leaving deliberate memory recall of the event intact. Pathological aspects of human memory in the aftermath of trauma may be malleable using non-invasive, cognitive interventions. This has implications for a novel avenue of preventative treatment development, much-needed as a crisis intervention for the aftermath of traumatic events."

We show here that distinct factors and mechanisms regulate the mobilization of endothelial (EPCs) and stromal progenitor cells (SPCs). Pretreatment of mice with VEGF did not disrupt the CXCR4/SDF-1α chemokine axis but stimulated entry of HPCs into the cell cycle via VEGFR1, reducing their migratory capacity in vitro and suppressing their mobilization in vivo. In contrast, VEGF pretreatment enhanced EPC mobilization via VEGFR2 in response to CXCR4 antagonism. Furthermore, SPC mobilization was detected when the CXCR4 antagonist was administered to mice pretreated with VEGF, but not G-CSF. Thus, differential mobilization of progenitor cell subsets is dependent upon the cytokine milieu that regulates cell retention and proliferation.

The bone marrow is a reservoir of progenitor cells, including hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), fibrocytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). In response to disease or tissue injury, these cells are mobilized from the bone marrow and recruited into tissues where they contribute either to disease progression or tissue repair (Takahashi et al., 1999Takahashi T.

Bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells are a major determinant of nascent tumor neovascularization.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1546-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). MSCs have the capacity to differentiate into adipocytic, chondrocytic, and osteogenic lineages and potentially other lineages including epithelial, myocardial, or neuronal lineages (Pittenger et al., 1999Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Multilineage potential of adult human mesenchymal stem cells.Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (17022) Google Scholar). It is thought, therefore, that MSCs may be used therapeutically to promote tissue regeneration in the treatment of diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta and Parkinson's disease (Hess and Borlongan, 2008Hess D.C. Borlongan C.V. Stem cells and neurological diseases.Cell Prolif. 2008; 41: 94-114PubMed Google Scholar, Bielby et al., 2007Bielby R. Jones E. McGonagle D. The role of mesenchymal stem cells in maintenance and repair of bone.Injury. 2007; 38: S26-S32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Additionally, MSCs have been reported to have immunosuppressive properties, and as such, they may be therapeutically useful for the treatment of autoimmune diseases (Le Blanc and Ringden, 2007Le Blanc K. Ringden O. Immunomodulation by mesenchymal stem cells and clinical experience.J. Intern. Med. 2007; 262: 509-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The therapeutic application of these distinct subpopulations of stem cells in the context of specific diseases is, therefore, widely anticipated. Currently, however, there are both practical and technical complications associated with harvesting, isolation, ex vivo expansion, and delivery of these cells. An alternative strategy for stem cell therapy is to stimulate the mobilization of stem cells from the bone marrow into the circulation, thereby circumventing these issues. This approach has been established clinically using G-CSF to mobilize HPCs for bone marrow transplants (BMTs) (Cashen et al., 2004Cashen A.F. Link D. Devine S. DiPersio J. Cytokines and stem cell mobilization for autologous and allogeneic transplantation.Curr. Hematol. Rep. 2004; 3: 406-412PubMed Google Scholar). Mobilization of progenitor cells is a multistage process, with initial release from their bone marrow niche followed by active migration across the bone marrow sinusoidal endothelium. The chemokine axis SDF-1α/CXCR4 is critically involved in the retention of hematopoietic stem cells within the bone marrow (Levesque et al., 2003Levesque J.P. Hendy J. Takamatsu Y. Simmons P.J. Bendall L.J. Disruption of the CXCR4/CXCL12 chemotactic interaction during hematopoietic stem cell mobilization induced by G-CSF or cyclophosphamide.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). At a molecular level, G-CSF has been shown to act by disrupting the SDF-1α/CXCR4 retention axis, both by reducing CXCR4 expression on HPCs and levels of SDF-1α in the bone marrow (Levesque et al., 2003Levesque J.P. Hendy J. Takamatsu Y. Simmons P.J. Bendall L.J. Disruption of the CXCR4/CXCL12 chemotactic interaction during hematopoietic stem cell mobilization induced by G-CSF or cyclophosphamide.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). This knowledge has led to the development of CXCR4 antagonists as HPC-mobilizing agents. In contrast to G-CSF, such antagonists work acutely, mobilizing HPCs within an hour. Moreover, we and others have shown that chronic G-CSF therapy combined with acute administration of a CXCR4 antagonist synergistically enhances HPC mobilization from the bone marrow (Broxmeyer et al., 2005Broxmeyer H.E. Orschell C.M. Clapp D.W. Hangoc G. Cooper S. Plett P.A. Liles W.C. Li X. Graham-Evans B.

Haematol. 2006; 134: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This combination therapy has recently shown greater efficacy compared to G-CSF alone in phase III clinical trials for BMT (Calandra et al., 2008Calandra G. McCarty J. McGuirk J. Tricot G. Crocker S.A. Badel K. Grove B. Dye A. Bridger G.

While it has been shown that administration of a CXCR4 antagonist alone increases the circulating numbers of EPCs and improves tissue perfusion following ischemia in animals (Capoccia et al., 2006Capoccia B.J. Shepherd R.M. Link D.C.

Angiogenic cells can be rapidly mobilized and efficiently harvested from the blood flowing treatment with AMD3100.Blood. 2006; 108: 3662-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), it is not known whether G-CSF therapy in combination with acute administration of the CXCR4 antagonist acts synergistically to mobilize EPCs. In addition to factors that disrupt the retention of EPCs in the bone marrow, EPCs may also be mobilized by factors, such as VEGF, that stimulate their migration (Asahara et al., 1997Asahara T. Murohara T. Sullivan A. Silver M. van der Zee R. Li T. Witzenbichler B. Schatteman G. Isner J.M. Isolation of putatative progenitor endothelial cells for angiogenesis.Science. 1997; 275: 964-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (7389) Google Scholar); however, the relative efficacy of VEGF versus G-CSF alone or in combination with other mobilizing reagents has not been specifically assessed with respect to EPC mobilization. There is evidence that bone-marrow-derived MSCs contribute to tissue regeneration, suggesting that these cells are also mobilized in response to tissue injury; however, the factors and mechanisms regulating the mobilization of MSCs are currently unknown. We have previously shown that different subpopulations of leukocytes are selectively mobilized from the bone marrow in response to specific blood-borne mediators via distinct mechanisms (Palframan et al., 1998Palframan R.T. Collins P.D. Severs N.J. Rothery S. Williams T.J. Rankin S.M.

The coordinated action of G-CSF and ELR+ CXC chemokines in neutrophil mobilization during acute inflammation.Blood. 2008; 111: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified pathways regulating the differential mobilization of discrete populations of progenitor cells. Circulating numbers of HPCs, EPCs, and SPCs were determined 1 hour after the administration of the CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100, to mice pretreated over 4 days with G-CSF, VEGF, or vehicle control. Administration of the CXCR4 antagonist alone increased circulating numbers of HPCs and EPCs within 1 hr (Figures 1B and 1C). Interestingly, SPCs were not detected in the blood. G-CSF pretreatment of mice also increased circulating numbers of HPCs and, to a lesser extent, EPCs. (Figures 1B and 1C). Intriguingly, no SPCs were detected (Figure 1D). While G-CSF pretreatment followed by acute administration of the CXCR4 antagonist synergistically enhanced circulating numbers of HPCs (Figure 1B), no such synergism (or even additive effect) was apparent for EPC mobilization (Figure 1C). Furthermore, SPCs could not be detected. Of note, EPCs were scored after 21 days in culture and were shown to be CD34-, VEGFR2-, VE-Cadherin-, and vWF-positive (Figures S1, S2, and S3 available online). Furthermore, these EPCs stained positively with GS-lectin, took up acetyl-LDL, and formed tubules in vitro. These EPCs are, therefore, equivalent to the so-called “late outgrowth EPCs” that have the capacity to form vessels in vivo (Yoder et al., 2007Yoder M.C. Mead L.E. Prater D. Krier T.R. Mroueh K.N. Li F. Krasich R. Temm C.J. Prchal J.T. Ingram D.A.

Bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells are a major determinant of nascent tumor neovascularization.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1546-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Importantly, the mobilized EPCs did not express CD115, CD14, or CD45 and are, thus, distinct from both HPCs and the EPCs that are of monocytic origin (Figures S1, S2, and S3) (Yoder et al., 2007Yoder M.C. Mead L.E. Prater D. Krier T.R. Mroueh K.N. Li F. Krasich R. Temm C.J. Prchal J.T. Ingram D.A.

Bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells are a major determinant of nascent tumor neovascularization.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1546-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). VEGF administration can increase circulating number of cells with an EPC phenotype (Asahara et al., 1997Asahara T. Murohara T. Sullivan A. Silver M. van der Zee R. Li T. Witzenbichler B. Schatteman G. Isner J.M. Isolation of putatative progenitor endothelial cells for angiogenesis.Science. 1997; 275: 964-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (7389) Google Scholar). Similarly, we observed an increase in EPC numbers following VEGF treatment of mice over 4 days (Figure 1C). Moreover, a more than additive increase in EPC numbers was observed when the CXCR4 antagonist was administered acutely to mice pretreated with VEGF as compared to mice treated with VEGF alone or administered a CXCR4 antagonist alone (p < 0.05; Figure 1C). In contrast to G-CSF, VEGF treatment did not increase circulating numbers of HPCs (Figure 1B). Further, we unexpectedly found that VEGF pretreatment profoundly suppressed circulating numbers of HPCs (77% reduction) mobilized by the CXCR4 antagonist (p < 0.01, Figure 1B). Uniquely, VEGF treatment combined with the CXCR4 antagonist led to a significant increase in circulating SPCs (CFU-F p < 0.001; Figure 1D). Mobilized SPCs displayed the same antigen expression as bone-marrow-derived SPCs (Figure S4A), which on expansion, exhibited trilineage differentiation potential (Figures S4C–S4E). Mobilized SPCs were plastic-adherent cells, shown to be CD29 and CD105 positive yet CD34 and CD45 negative (Figure S4B). Mobilized SPCs had the same characteristics as murine mesenchymal stem cells (Phinney et al., 1999Phinney D.G. Kopen G. Isaacson R.L. Prockop D.J.

Nardi N.B. Murine marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell: isolation, in vitro expansion, and characterization.Br. J. Haematol. 2003; 123: 703-711Crossref Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Mobilized SPCs were also negative for VE-Cadherin and vWF and were, therefore, distinct from mobilized EPCs (Figure S4B). These results suggest that fundamentally different mechanisms regulate the mobilization of phenotypically distinct HPCs, EPCs, and SPCs. To determine whether the differences in circulating numbers of progenitors cells was due specifically to differences in their rate of egress out of the bone marrow, we used an in situ perfusion model of the murine hind limb developed by our group to directly assess mobilization. In this system, the femoral artery and vein are cannulated in situ such that the femur and tibia bone marrow are perfused in isolation. Mobilized cells are then collected via the femoral vein (Martin et al., 2003Martin C. Burdon P.C. Bridger G. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Williams T.J. Rankin S.M.

J. Haematol. 2006; 134: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This technique allows direct comparisons of the number of cells mobilized over a defined period of time, without the complications of progenitor cell trafficking into other tissues, including their return to the bone marrow. Mice were pretreated with vehicle, G-CSF, or VEGF for 4 days. On day 5, the femoral artery was infused for 10 min with either vehicle or the CXCR4 antagonist, and cells mobilized were collected over a period of 1 hr (Figure 2A, Experimental Protocol). When the CXCR4 antagonist was infused into vehicle pretreated mice, HPCs and EPCs, but not SPCs, were mobilized from the bone marrow (p < 0.001; Figures 2B–2D). Pretreatment of mice with G-CSF over 4 days enhanced the basal rate of HPC and EPC egress from the bone marrow (p < 0.001, Figures 2B and 2C). However, G-CSF pretreatment did not lead to the mobilization of SPCs (Figure 2D). As indicated above, G-CSF pretreatment followed by the CXCR4 antagonist led to a synergistic mobilization of HPCs (p < 0.001, Figure 2B), but not EPCs (Figure 2C). Furthermore, no SPCs were mobilized (Figure 2D). VEGF pretreatment resulted in significant EPC mobilization (p < 0.001; Figure 2C); however, HPCs and SPCs were not mobilized (Figures 2B and 2D). Furthermore, VEGF pretreatment almost completely suppressed HPC mobilization induced by infusion of the CXCR4 antagonist (p < 0.001; Figure 1E; 75% reduction), while an additive effect was observed for EPC mobilization (p < 0.01; Figure 2C). Uniquely with this treatment regimen, SPCs were mobilized (p < 0.001; Figure 2D). These experiments definitively show that changes in circulating numbers of progenitors are due to changes in their rate of egress from the bone marrow. The selective mobilization of EPCs and SPCs achieved by treating mice over 4 days with VEGF followed by administration of the CXCR4 antagonist was not reproduced when mice were treated acutely with a combination of VEGF and the CXCR4 antagonist. Infusion of either G-CSF or VEGF directly into the femoral artery for 10 min and collection up to 60 min mobilized both HPCs and EPCs (p < 0.001; Figures S5A and S5B). However, acute administration of VEGF (in contrast to VEGF pretreatment over 4 days) did not inhibit the mobilization of HPCs with a CXCR4 antagonist, and acute administration of G-CSF did not act synergistically with the CXCR4 antagonist to mobilize HPCs (Figures S5A and S5B). Further, neither growth factor, when administered acutely or in combination with the CXCR4 antagonist, led to mobilization of SPCs (Figure S5C). This suggested that the ability of G-CSF and VEGF to promote the differential mobilization of progenitor cell subsets is dependent on changes to the bone marrow environment or the progenitor cell phenotype that occurs over a number of days. We next determined whether treatment of mice over 4 days with VEGF or G-CSF affected the number of progenitor cells in the bone marrow. The total number of cells in the femurs of mice treated with VEGF (1.07 ± 0.11 × 107 cells/femur) or G-CSF (1.41 ± 0.28 × 107 cells/femur) was not significantly different compared to control mice (1.19 ± 0.07 × 107 cells/femur). Furthermore, no difference was observed in the frequency of HPCs (Figure 3A), EPCs (Figure 3B), or SPCs (Figure 3C) in the bone marrow of VEGF-treated mice compared to controls. However, G-CSF treatment did cause a significant reduction in the number of bone marrow EPCs (p < 0.001, Figure 3B) and an increase in the number of SPCs (p < 0.05, Figure 3C). To determine whether VEGF treatment of mice affected the gross morphology of the bone marrow, we performed histological analysis of bone marrow in mice treated over 4 days with PBS or VEGF. As shown in Figure 3D, we observed no differences in the gross morphology, the number of sinusoidal blood vessels, or endothelial integrity (Figure 3D). Thus, with no gross morphological changes occurring to the bone marrow of mice treated with VEGF that might affect cellular egress, we next examined whether the molecular retention mechanisms had been disturbed. In mice treated with G-CSF, we observed a significant reduction in levels of SDF-1α (p < 0.001, Figure 4A) and CXCR4 expression on HPCs (p < 0.05, Figure 4B); however, the expression of CXCR4 on EPCs was unchanged (Figure 4C), suggesting that G-CSF does not directly effect EPC retention. In contrast, VEGF treatment did not alter the expression of CXCR4 on either HPCs or EPCs (Figures 4B and 4C). Moreover, SDF-1α levels in bone marrow supernatant following VEGF treatment were not altered (Figure 4A). While the anti-CXCR4 antibody used here is targeted to the epitope matching the first 63 amino acids starting from the N terminus of a GST-NCXCR4 fusion protein (Forster et al., 1998Forster R. Kremmer E. Schubel A. Breitfeld D. Kleinschmidt A. Nerl C. Bernhardt G. Lipp M. Intracellular and surface expression of the HIV-1 coreceptor CXCR4/fusin on various leukocyte subsets: rapid internalization and recycling upon activation.J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1522-1531PubMed Google Scholar), it is noted that G-CSF will cleave part of this epitope, inhibiting the function of CXCR4 (Levesque et al., 2003Levesque J.P. Hendy J. Takamatsu Y. Simmons P.J. Bendall L.J. Disruption of the CXCR4/CXCL12 chemotactic interaction during hematopoietic stem cell mobilization induced by G-CSF or cyclophosphamide.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Thus, reduced antibody binding indicates either a reduction in the expression of the functional receptor or an absolute loss of the receptor. Thus, we can conclude that VEGF treatment does not inhibit the function of CXCR4 or affect its cell-surface expression. These data indicate that VEGF treatment does not disrupt the CXCR4/SDF-1α retention pathway and, therefore, explains why VEGF alone does not mobilize HPCs from the bone marrow. Mobilization is dependent on cellular migration across the bone marrow sinusoidal endothelium. Given that VEGF did not alter CXCR4 expression on HPCs or EPCs (Figures 4B and 4C), we examined the ability of bone-marrow-derived HPCs and EPCs from G-CSF- or VEGF-treated mice to undergo chemotaxis toward SDF-1α in vitro since in PBS-treated mice, both HPCs and EPCs migrated to SDF-1α (p < 0.001; Figures 4D–4G). G-CSF treatment leads to further increased migration of HPCs and EPCs to SDF-1α (p < 0.001; Figures 4D and 4E). In contrast, VEGF treatment abolished the ability of HPCs to migrate to SDF-1α but had no effect on EPC migration (Figures 4F and 4G). The suppression of HPC chemotaxis toward SDF-1α suggested that HPCs from VEGF-treated mice were refractory to migratory stimuli despite expressing CXCR4. Neutrophils, like progenitor cells, are also retained within the bone marrow by the CXCR4/SDF-1α axis and, as such, can be mobilized by G-CSF treatment or CXCR4 antagonism (p < 0.001; Figure 5A; Martin et al., 2003Martin C. Burdon P.C. Bridger G. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Williams T.J. Rankin S.M. Chemokines acting via CXCR2 and CXCR4 control the release of neutrophils from the bone marrow and their return following senescence.Immunity. 2003; 19: 583-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated whether VEGF pretreatment of mice suppressed neutrophil mobilization as we observed for HPC mobilization (Figures 1B and 2B). As shown in Figure 5A, VEGF pretreatment profoundly suppressed neutrophil mobilization in response to the CXCR4 antagonist (p < 0.05, 92% reduction). This effect was not seen when VEGF was administered acutely to mice (Figure 5B). We, therefore, investigated whether the migratory capacity of neutrophils after VEGF treatment was impaired in a similar manner to HPCs. During inflammatory reactions, neutrophils are rapidly mobilized from the bone marrow by ELR+ CXC chemokines (e.g., KC), which stimulate neutrophil migration across the bone marrow sinusoidal endothelium (Martin et al., 2003Martin C. Burdon P.C. Bridger G. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Williams T.J. Rankin S.M.

The coordinated action of G-CSF and ELR+ CXC chemokines in neutrophil mobilization during acute inflammation.Blood. 2008; 111: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, KC-induced mobilization of neutrophils in vivo was completely abrogated in mice pretreated with VEGF (p < 0.001; Figure 5C). However, VEGF treatment did not affect either the proportion of Gr-1+ bone marrow neutrophils expressing CXCR2 (Figure 5D) or the ability of bone marrow neutrophils to migrate toward KC in vitro (Figure 5E). Thus, while VEGF pretreatment suppressed both HPC and neutrophil mobilization in vivo, neutrophils, but not HPCs, retained the ability to undergo chemotaxis in vitro, suggesting that the suppression of HPC chemotaxis was particular to their character as progenitor cells compared to neutrophils, which are terminally differentiated cells. Analysis of bone marrow revealed a significant reduction in absolute numbers of mature neutrophils (band and segmented nuclei) following VEGF treatment (Figure 5F). It is unclear, however, whether this reduction in the bone marrow reserve accounts for the dramatic reduction in neutrophil mobilization. Activation of HPCs via VEGFR1 is required for cell survival and cell cycling (Hattori et al., 2001Hattori K. Dias S. Heissig B. Hackett N.R. Lyden D. Tateno M. Hicklin D.J. Zhu Z. Witte L.

Since a refractoriness of HPCs to migrate is a feature of cell cycling (Bowie et al., 2006Bowie M.B. McKnight K.D. Kent D.G. McCaffrey L. Hoodless P.A. Eaves C.J.

Examination of HPC colonies grown from bone marrow of VEGF-treated mice revealed a significant increase in both their cellular content and size compared to controls (Figures 6A and 6B), suggesting that VEGF promotes proliferation of CFU-HPC ex vivo. In vivo analysis revealed that VEGF treatment led to a significant increase in the percentage of BM-HPCs (Lin−Sca-1+ cells) in the S/G2/M proliferative phase of the cell cycle (Figure 6C). In direct contrast, VEGF treatment did not alter the percentage of CD34+VEGFR2+ EPCs in the S/G2/M phase of the cell cycle (Figure 6"

Gestational protein restriction in rats causes LBW, beta-cell dysfunction, and reduced longevity. These effects may be mediated by accelerated cellular aging. This study tested the hypothesis that LBW followed by rapid postnatal catch-up growth leads to islet telomere shortening through alterations in antioxidant defense capacity, stress/senescence marker proteins, and DNA repair mechanisms at the gene expression level. We used our rat model of gestational protein restriction (recuperated offspring) and control offspring. Southern blotting revealed shorter (P<0.001) islet telomeres in recuperated animals compared to controls. This was associated with increased expression of peroxiredoxin 1 (P<0.05), peroxiredoxin 3 (P<0.01), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (P<0.05), which are up-regulated under stress conditions. MnSOD expression was significantly (P<0.05) decreased in recuperated offspring, suggesting partial impairment of mitochondrial antioxidant defenses. Markers of cellular senescence p21 and p16 were also increased (P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively) in the recuperated group. We conclude that maternal diet influences expression of markers of cellular stress and telomere length in pancreatic islets. This may provide a mechanistic link between early nutrition and growth and type 2 diabetes."

Fbw7 interacts with nuclear SREBP1 and enhances its ubiquitination and degradation in a manner dependent on the phosphorylation of Thr-426 and Ser-430. The phosphorylation of these two residues is enhanced in response to DNA binding and GSK-3β is recruited to the promoters of SREBP target genes in vivo (12Punga T. Bengoechea-Alonso M.T. Ericsson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25278-25286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Consequently, Fbw7 is recruited to SREBP target promoters and induces the ubiquitination and degradation of SREBP1. In the current study, we identify a novel serine residue, Ser-434, in the C terminus of mature SREBP1 that is phosphorylated by GSK-3. Our results demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Ser-434 in SREBP1 is required for the GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation of Thr-426 and Ser-430 in its phosphodegron. Consequently, the phosphorylation of Ser-434 regulates the interaction between SREBP1 and Fbw7, thereby controlling the degradation of mature SREBP1. The phosphorylation of Ser-434 is also enhanced in response to DNA binding, and mutation of Ser-434 blocks the phosphorylation of Thr-426 and Ser-430 during this process, suggesting that the phosphorylation of Ser-434 could control the degradation of active SREBP1 molecules. Thus, the degradation of mature SREBP1 is controlled by cross-talk between multiple phosphorylated residues in its C-terminal domain, and the phosphorylation of Ser-434 could function as a molecular switch to control these processes.

Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 1% aprotinin, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and cleared by centrifugation. For co-immunoprecipitations, cell lysates were prepared in the absence of SDS and sodium deoxycholate. Cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). To ensure that equal amounts of protein were loaded in each well, the levels of α-tubulin in the samples were estimated by Western blotting. Determination of Protein Half-life—Cells were treated with cycloheximide to stop protein synthesis and incubated for the indicated times. Total cell lysates were prepared, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. SREBP1 was visualized by Western blotting followed by quantitation on a charge-coupled device camera (Fuji) and image analysis software (Aida Image Analyzer 3.10). Luciferase and β-Galactosidase Assays—Cells were transiently transfected with the indicated promoter-reporter genes in the absence or presence of expression vectors for SREBP1, either wild-type or the indicated mutants. After 36 h, luciferase activities were determined in duplicate samples as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). The pCH110 vector encoding the β-galactosidase gene under the control of the SV40 promoter (Amersham Biosciences) was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Luciferase values (relative light units) were calculated by dividing the luciferase activity by the β-galactosidase activity. The data represent the average ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in duplicates. Reverse Transcription-PCR Assays—RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription with oligo(dT), followed by PCR with target-specific primers. The PCR reactions, using Invitrogen High Fidelity DNA polymerase, were optimized for the individual target genes. The PCR programs and primer sequences for the human LDL receptor, HMG-CoA synthase, fatty acid synthase, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes are available on request. GSK-3 Phosphorylates Ser-434 in SREBP1—We recently identified two phosphorylated residues in the C terminus of mature SREBP1a, Thr-426 and Ser-430 (9Sundqvist A. Bengoechea-Alonso M.T. Ye X. Lukiyanchuk V. Jin J. Harper J.W. Ericsson J. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). GSK-3 is involved in the phosphorylation of both Thr-426 and Ser-430. However, kinase assays with recombinant GSK-3β and SREBP1a followed by phosphopeptide mapping indicated that the C terminus of mature SREBP1a contained additional residues phosphorylated by GSK-3 (data not shown). The C-terminal domains of mature SREBP1a and SREBP1c are identical. Data base searches suggested that Ser-434 in SREBP1a (Ser-410 in SREBP1c) could be phosphorylated by GSK-3. To determine if SREBP1a was phosphorylated on Ser-434, we generated a phospho-Ser-434-specific anti-SREBP1 antibody (pS434). This antibody recognized wild-type SREBP1a following expression in HEK293T cells, whereas it failed to recognize the S434A mutant (Fig. 1A). Wild-type SREBP1c was also recognized by the antibody, whereas the S410A mutant was not (Fig. 1A), demonstrating that both isoforms of SREBP1 are phosphorylated on this serine residue. In addition, the recognition of wild-type SREBP1a was competed with a peptide containing phospho-Ser-434, but not with peptides in which Thr-426 or Ser-430 was phosphorylated (supplemental Fig. S1), supporting the specificity of the antibody. Our phosphopeptide mapping suggested that Ser-434 could be phosphorylated by GSK-3β in vitro. Indeed, in vitro kinase assays demonstrated that GSK-3β phosphorylates Ser-434 in SREBP1a (Fig. 1B). To test whether endogenous GSK-3 could phosphorylate Ser-434 in endogenous SREBP1, HeLa cells were treated with lithium, a pharmacologic GSK-3 inhibitor. The pS434 antibody only recognized the mature form of SREBP1 and not the membrane-associated precursor, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser-434 is specific for the nuclear form of the protein. Inhibition of GSK-3 reduced the phosphorylation of Ser-434 (Fig. 1C), indicating that this residue is phosphorylated by GSK-3 in vivo. Lithium also reduced the phosphorylation of Ser-434 in HepG2 (Fig. 1D). Similar results were obtained with the GSK-3 inhibitor SB 415286 (Fig. 1E). The reduction in Ser-434 phosphorylation was specific for GSK-3 inhibitors, because inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase (UO126) and cyclin-dependent kinases (roscovitine) failed to affect the phosphorylation of this residue in HeLa cells (Fig. 1F). Interestingly, prolonged treatment of HeLa cells with lithium and SB 415286 increased the steady-state levels of mature SREBP1 (Fig. 2A), supporting the notion that GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation of mature SREBP1 promotes its degradation (9Sundqvist A. Bengoechea-Alonso M.T. Ye X. Lukiyanchuk V. Jin J. Harper J.W. Ericsson J. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In support of this possibility, we found that nuclear SREBP1 phosphorylated on Ser-434 accumulated in HeLa cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Fig. 2B), indicating that nuclear SREBP1 phosphorylated on this residue is rapidly turned over by proteasome-mediated degradation. Similar results were also obtained in HepG2 cells (supplemental Fig. S2). Furthermore, siRNA-mediated inactivation of GSK-3 reduced the phosphorylation of Ser-434 in endogenous SREBP1 in HeLa cells (Fig. 2C), as well as HepG2 and U2OS cells (supplemental Fig. S2), confirming that GSK-3 contributes to the phosphorylation of Ser-434 in SREBP1. siRNA-mediated inactivation of both GSK-3α and -β in HeLa cells resulted in a small reduction of the levels of mature SREBP1 (Fig. 2C). This could be explained, at least in part, by a significant reduction in the expression of the precursor form of SREBP1 in response to prolonged inactivation of GSK-3 (data not shown). Growth factors, including insulin, negatively regulate the activity of GSK-3 through Akt-mediated phosphorylation. Thus, we speculated that insulin-dependent inhibition of GSK-3 could attenuate the phosphorylation of Ser-434 in SREBP1. As illustrated in Fig. 2D, a short treatment of HepG2 cells with insulin enhanced the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3. Consequently, the phosphorylation of SREBP1 on Ser-434 was reduced in response to insulin treatment, resulting in the accumulation of nuclear SREBP1. These data indicate that the phosphorylation of Ser-434 in SREBP1 requires endogenous GSK-3 activity and that these processes are regulated by insulin signaling. Phosphorylation of Ser-434 Destabilizes SREBP1—We have previously demonstrated that the mature form of SREBP1 is destabilized following GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation of Thr-426 and Ser-430 (9Sundqvist A. Bengoechea-Alonso M.T. Ye X. Lukiyanchuk V. Jin J. Harper J.W. Ericsson J. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). To determine if phosphorylation of Ser-434 could be involved in regulating the stability of SREBP1, cells were transfected with mature SREBP1a, either wild-type or the phosphorylation-deficient S434A mutant. The steady-state levels of the S434A mutant were enhanced compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 3A), indicating that phosphorylation of Ser-434 destabilizes SREBP1. Similar results were obtained when the corresponding residue (Ser-410) was mutated in SREBP1c (Fig. 3A), suggesting that phosphorylation of this residue regulates the stability of both SREBP1 isoforms. The S434A mutant of SREBP1a was also stabilized in HEK293, HeLa, and HepG2 cells (supplemental Fig. S3). Interestingly, the steady-state levels of a phosphorylation-mimetic mutant of SREBP1a (S434D) were slightly reduced compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 3B), further supporting the notion that phosphorylation of Ser-434 destabilizes SREBP1. The mRNA levels of the constructs in Fig. 3 (A and B) were similar (supplemental Fig. S4), suggesting that the expression of these mutants was affected at the protein level. To confirm that the enhanced abundance of the S434A mutant resulted from reduced degradation, we measured the half-life of mature SREBP1a, either wild-type or the S434A mutant, in transfected HEK293T cells. As illustrated in Fig. 3C, the turnover of the mutant protein was reduced compared with wild-type SREBP1a. The accumulation of the S434A mutant should lead to an enhanced expression of SREBP target genes. To test this hypothesis, HepG2 cells were transfected with an SREBP-responsive promoter-reporter gene in the absence or presence of mature SREBP1a, either wild-type, S434A, or S434D. In support of our hypothesis, the transcriptional activity of the S434A mutant was enhanced, whereas the activity of the S434D mutant was reduced compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 3D). Mutation of the corresponding residue in SREBP1c (S410) also enhanced its transcriptional activity (Fig. 3D), indicating that the phosphorylation of Ser-434 and its effect on the stability of SREBP1 influences the biological function of SREBP1. This possibility was supported when we analyzed the expression of endogenous target genes in HEK293 cells transfected with mature SREBP1a. The expression of both the LDL receptor and HMG-CoA synthase genes was higher in cells expressing the S434A mutant compared with cells expressing wild-type SREBP1a (Fig. 3E). If our hypothesis was correct, activation of GSK-3 should induce the degradation of mature SREBP1. To test this, cells were treated with wortmannin and LY294002, two phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors. Both inhibitors reduced the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3 and resulted in reduced steady-state levels of mature SREBP1 (Fig. 4A). This effect was specific for the PI3K inhibitors, because the mTor inhibitor rapamycin failed to affect SREBP1 levels. Interestingly, both PI3K inhibitors failed to affect the levels of mature SREBP1 in the presence the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that activation of GSK-3 results in enhanced degradation of mature SREBP1. To test this hypothesis, HepG2 cells were transfected with mature SREBP1a, either wild-type, S434A, or the double mutant T426A/S430A and treated with LY294002. As seen in Fig. 4C, LY294002 reduced the levels of wild-type SREBP1a, whereas the degradation of the S434A mutant was attenuated and the double mutant was resistant to LY294002 treatment, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser-434 and the phosphodegron in SREBP1 is important for this effect. As expected, inhibition of PI3K in HepG2 cells attenuated the accumulation of mature SREBP1 in response to a short pulse of insulin (Fig. 4D). Again, this effect was specific for PI3K, because rapamycin only had a marginal effect, suggesting that PI3K signaling, but not mTor, is important for the acute response to insulin signaling in these cells. Ser-434 Regulates the Phosphorylation of Thr-426 and Ser-430—Our data indicate that phosphorylation of Ser-434 promotes the degradation of SREBP1. The active form of SREBP1 is targeted for degradation following phosphorylation of Thr-426 and Ser-430. One possibility was therefore that the phosphorylation of Ser-434 could influence the subsequent phosphorylation of Thr-426 and Ser-430. To test this possibility, HEK293T cells were transfected with mature SREBP1a, either wild-type or the T426A, S430A, or S434A mutants, and the phosphorylation of Thr-426, Ser-430, and Ser-434 was determined following immunoprecipitation of the various proteins. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, all three residues were phosphorylated when wild-type SREBP1a was expressed in cells. Mutation of Thr-426 did not only block the phosphorylation of this residue but also significantly reduced the phosphorylation of Ser-430, whereas the phosphorylation of Ser-434 was only somewhat reduced in the T426A mutant. Mutation of Ser-430 attenuated the phosphorylation of Thr-426 and Ser-434. Importantly, mutation of Ser-434 drastically reduced the phosphorylation of Ser-430 and also resulted in a significant attenuation of the phosphorylation of Thr-426. Thus, both Thr-426 and Ser-434 regulate the phosphorylation of Ser-430, and Ser-434 regulates the phosphorylation of both Thr-426 and Ser-430. Therefore, phosphorylation of Ser-434 could potentially regulate the phosphorylation of the phosphodegron in SREBP1, thereby affecting the stability of mature SREBP1. This possibility is in agreement with our observation that the S434A mutant of SREBP1 is stabilized (Fig. 3, A-C). The results in Fig. 5A suggest that Ser-434 regulates the GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation of Thr-426 and Ser-430. To test this possibility, we used recombinant SREBP1, either wild-type or the S434A mutant, in kinase assays with recombinant GSK-3β. As seen in Fig. 5B, the GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of Thr-426 was significantly reduced, and the phosphorylation of Ser-430 completely lost in the S434A mutant, confirming that Ser-434 plays an important role in the phosphorylation of both these residues. Interestingly, mutation of Ser-430 reduced the GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation of Thr-426 (Fig. 5C), suggesting that Ser-430 is a priming site for the phosphorylation of Thr-426. SREBP1 has a serine residue (Ser-438 in SREBP1a) four residues downstream of Ser-434 that could function as a priming site for the phosphorylation of Ser-434. However, mutation of this residue (S438A) failed to affect the phosphorylation of Ser-434, Ser-430, or Thr-426 and failed to affect the steady-state levels of transfected mature SREBP1a (supplemental Fig. S5). Taken together, our results suggest that the GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation of Thr-426 is dependent on the phosphorylation of Ser-430, which in turn is dependent on the phosphorylation of Ser-434. We recently found that GSK-3β is recruited to SREBP target genes and that the GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of Thr-426 and Ser-430 in SREBP1 is enhanced in response to DNA binding (12Punga T.

https://openalex.org/W2023495875,"microRNAs play a critically important role in a wide array of biological processes including those implicated in cancer, neuro-degenerative and metabolic disorders, and viral infection. Although we have begun to understand microRNA biogenesis and function, experimental demonstration of their functional effects and the molecular mechanisms by which they function remains a challenge. Members of the let-7/miR-98 family play a critical role in cell cycle control with respect to differentiation and tumorigenesis. In this study, we show that exogenous addition of pre-let-7 in primary human fibroblasts results in a decrease in cell number and an increased fraction of cells in the G(2)/M cell cycle phase. Combining microarray techniques with DNA sequence analysis to identify potential let-7 targets, we discovered 838 genes with a let-7 binding site in their 3'-untranslated region that were down-regulated upon overexpression of let-7b. Among these genes is cdc34, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme of the Skp1/cullin/F-box (SCF) complex. Cdc34 protein levels are strongly down-regulated by let-7 overexpression. Reporter assays demonstrated direct regulation of the cdc34 3'-untranslated region by let-7. We hypothesized that low Cdc34 levels would result in decreased SCF activity, stabilization of the SCF target Wee1, and G(2)/M accumulation. Consistent with this hypothesis, small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of Wee1 reversed the G(2)/M phenotype induced by let-7 overexpression. We conclude that Cdc34 is a functional target of let-7 and that let-7 induces down-regulation of Cdc34, stabilization of the Wee1 kinase, and an increased fraction of cells in G(2)/M in primary fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2005475594,"α-Synuclein remains a protein of interest due to its propensity to form fibrillar aggregates in neurodegenerative disease and its putative function in synaptic vesicle regulation. Herein, we present a series of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of wild-type α-synuclein and three Parkinson disease familial mutants (A30P, A53T, and E46K) in two distinct environments. First, in order to match recent NMR experiments, we have simulated each protein bound to an SDS detergent micelle. Second, in order to connect more closely to the true biological environment, we have simulated the proteins bound to a 1,2-dioleoyl-<i>sn</i>-glycero-3-phosphoserine lipid bilayer. In the micelle-bound case, we find that the wild type and all of the variants of α-synuclein flatten the underlying micelle, decreasing its surface area. A30P is known to lessen α-synuclein/membrane affinity and, consistent with experiment, destabilizes the simulated secondary structure. In the case of A53T, our simulations reveal a range of stabilizing hydrogen bonds that form with the threonine. In both environments, the E46K mutation, which is known to increase bilayer affinity, leads to an additional hydrogen bond between the protein and either the detergent or lipid. Simulations indicate that αS and its variants are less dynamic in the bilayer than in the micelle. Furthermore, the simulations of the mutants suggest how changes in the structure and dynamics of α-synuclein may affect its biological role."
https://openalex.org/W2105459324,"The deep ocean greater than 1 km covers the majority of the earth's surface. Interspersed on the abyssal plains and continental slope are an estimated 14000 seamounts, topographic features extending 1000 m off the seafloor. A variety of hypotheses are posited that suggest the ecological, evolutionary, and oceanographic processes on seamounts differ from those governing the surrounding deep sea. The most prominent and oldest of these hypotheses, the seamount endemicity hypothesis (SMEH), states that seamounts possess a set of isolating mechanisms that produce highly endemic faunas. Here, we constructed a faunal inventory for Davidson Seamount, the first bathymetric feature to be characterized as a ‘seamount’, residing 120 km off the central California coast in approximately 3600 m of water (Fig 1). We find little support for the SMEH among megafauna of a Northeast Pacific seamount; instead, finding an assemblage of species that also occurs on adjacent continental margins. A large percentage of these species are also cosmopolitan with ranges extending over much of the Pacific Ocean Basin. Despite the similarity in composition between the seamount and non-seamount communities, we provide preliminary evidence that seamount communities may be structured differently and potentially serve as source of larvae for suboptimal, non-seamount habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2053444468,"Ca2+ signaling in mitochondria has been mainly attributed to Ca2+ entry to the matrix through the Ca2+ uniporter and activation of mitochondrial matrix dehydrogenases. However, mitochondria can also sense increases in cytosolic Ca2+ through a mechanism that involves the aspartate-glutamate carriers, extramitochondrial Ca2+ activation of the NADH malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS). Both pathways are linked through the shared substrate α-ketoglutarate (αKG). Here we have studied the interplay between the two pathways under conditions of Ca2+ activation. We show that αKG becomes limiting when Ca2+ enters in brain or heart mitochondria, but not liver mitochondria, resulting in a drop in αKG efflux through the oxoglutarate carrier and in a drop in MAS activity. Inhibition of αKG efflux and MAS activity by matrix Ca2+ in brain mitochondria was fully reversible upon Ca2+ efflux. Because of their differences in cytosolic calcium concentration requirements, the MAS and Ca2+ uniporter-mitochondrial dehydrogenase pathways are probably sequentially activated during a Ca2+ transient, and the inhibition of MAS at the center of the transient may provide an explanation for part of the increase in lactate observed in the stimulated brain in vivo.

Res. 2007; 85: 3367-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Studies in cultured neurons, which have aralar as only AGC isoform, showed that small Ca2+ signals that have limited access to mitochondria are able to activate the aralar-MAS pathway (4Pardo B.

However, large Ca2+ signals that induce robust mitochondrial Ca2+ transients fail to activate the pathway (4Pardo B. Contreras L. Serrano A. Ramos M. Kobayashi K. Iijima M. Saheki T. Satrustegui J.

This suggested that in neuronal mitochondria the aralar-MAS pathway is inhibited under conditions in which the CaU-mitDH pathway is activated. This surprising result indicates that Ca2+ activation of the malate aspartate shuttle and tricarboxylic acid cycle activity are somehow mutually exclusive in neurons. We have now studied the interplay between the AGG-MAS and CaU-mitDH pathways in brain mitochondria under Ca2+-stimulation conditions. Our results show that the shared metabolite αKG controls the relationship between the second transporter of MAS, the oxoglutarate carrier (OGC, Slc25a11), and αKGDH in the Krebs cycle, by virtue of the effects of Ca2+ on the kinetics of αKGDH. Interestingly, the inhibition of OGC and MAS is fully reversible, in parallel with Ca2+ egress from mitochondria. Behaviorally evoked brain activation results in an increased cerebral blood flow and increased glucose utilization, but paradoxically, this is not accompanied with an equivalent increase in oxygen utilization (14Fox P.T.

Our results suggest that MAS inhibition during Ca2+-induced Krebs cycle activation would drive pyruvate to lactate formation and may play a role in lactate formation during brain activation. Animals and Materials-3-Month-old C57BL/6xSv129 mice were housed with a 12-h light cycle and fed ad libitum on standard chow. Animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the tissue of interest was quickly dissected and kept in ice-cold media for mitochondrial isolation, which was carried out at 4 °C. All animal procedures were approved by European guidelines. All reagents were obtained from Sigma, except malate dehydrogenase (Roche Applied Science), Fura-2, Calcium-Green5N (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and CGP-37157 (Tocris Biosciences, Ellisville, MO). Mitochondrial Isolation-Mitochondria were isolated from the brain, liver, and heart of 3-month-old C57BL/6xSv129 mice, as described previously (20Han D. Antunes F. Canali R. Rettori D. Cadenas E. J.

Briefly, mitochondria (0.1–0.15 mg of brain and liver and 0.020–0.030 mg of heart) were resuspended in 3 ml of MSK(with 100 μm digitonin for brain preparations), and the shuttle was reconstituted in the presence of 4 units/ml aspartate aminotransferase, 6 units/ml malate dehydrogenase, 66 μm NADH, 5 mm aspartate, 5 mm malate, 0.5 mm ADP. When appropriate, 200 nm Ruthenium Red (RR) and calibrated calcium concentrations were present. mitGPDH activity was measured in a similar way in MSK, with 0.5 mm ADP, 66 μm NADH, and 2 units/ml glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (27Dawson A.G. Cooney G.J. FEBS Lett. 1978; 91: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Once a base line is achieved, either 5 mm glutamate (MAS) or 5 mm glycerol 3-phosphate (mitGPDH) was added to trigger shuttle activity, coupled to the decrease in NADH fluorescence (excitation 340 nm, excitation 465 nm). All assays were performed at 37 °C under constant stirring. Measurement of OGC Activity-Transport of α-KG through the OGC was measured by a modification of the MAS reconstitution system. Appropriate amounts of mitochondrial protein of the tissue of interest were resuspended in 3 ml of MSK supplemented with 66 μm NADH, 0.5 mm ADP, 3 mm (NH4)2SO4, 5 mm glutamate, 10 units/ml GDH (and 100 μm digitonin when brain mitochondria were assayed). 5 mm malate addition initiated αKG efflux from mitochondria, which was followed by a decrease in NADH fluorescence. Experiments were performed at 37 °C under constant stirring. When indicated, 200 nm RR and calibrated calcium additions were made. Free Calcium Calibration-The free calcium concentrations in the assays obtained after the different CaCl2 additions were determined in the presence of Fura-2 (under 1 μm, Kd = 224 nm; excitation, 340 and 380 nm; emission, 510 nm; concentration 5 μm) or Calcium-Green5N (over 1 μm, Kd = 14 μm; excitation, 506 nm; emission, 532 nm; concentration 0.1 μm). Free calcium concentration was calculated as established for ratiometric and nonratiometric probes (28Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol.

Enzymatic Assays-Enzyme activities were assayed in either freshly isolated or freeze-thawed mitochondria from different tissues of 3-month-old C57BL/6xSv129 mice. Experiments were performed in a final volume of 200 μl and 20–50 μg of protein in a FLUOstar optima (BMG-Labtech) plate fluorimeter at 30 °C. Activities were calculated as the initial slope of NADH fluorescence changes per mg of protein. An NADH calibration curve was performed daily by adding known amounts of NADH to medium. The following additions were made to the medium (MME: 50 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; 0.2% Triton, and 10 μm rotenone (32Starkov A.A. Fiskum G. Chinopoulos C. Lorenzo B.J. Browne S.E. Patel M.S.

After establishment of a base line, activity was triggered with the appropriate substrate as follows: 5 mm glutamate or aspartate and 12.5 mm αKG (GDH, aspartate aminotransferase, and αKGDH, respectively (30Robert R.

Mitochondrial Membrane Potential-Mitochondrial membrane potential was estimated by quenching of tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM, 549 nm excitation, 575 nm emission) fluorescence, as described previously (34Chalmers S. Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19062-19070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Briefly, after stabilization of TMRM (300 nm) fluorescence, 100 μg of mitochondria were added to 2 ml of MSK containing 5 mm aspartate. Changes in membrane potential were followed qualitatively by the variations of the TMRM fluorescence after addition of substrates (glutamate/malate, 5 mm), ADP (0.5 mm), and calcium (5 μm free calcium). When indicated, 50 mm Na+ replaced 50 mm K+ in MSK (MSKNa medium). A calcium unbuffered medium (MSK or MSKNa without EDTA) was also used. Ca2+ Egress from Mitochondria-Brain mitochondria (0.25 mg/ml) were incubated in calcium-unbuffered medium (i.e. MSK or MSKNa without EDTA) in the presence of ADP (0.5 mm), aspartate (5 mm), malate (5 mm), digitonin (100 μm) and Calcium-Green5N (0.1 μm). After a stable base line was achieved, an addition of 10 μm CaCl2 was made (40 nmol/mg, giving a free calcium of 5 μm), and calcium uptake was monitored for 5 min before glutamate (5 mm) addition. Where indicated, ruthenium red (200 nm) was added to stop calcium uptake through the uniporter. In some assays, CGP-37157 (10 μm) was added to inhibit the mitochondrial Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) (35Hernandez-SanMiguel E. Vay L. Santo-Domingo J. Lobaton C.D. Moreno A. Montero M. Alvarez J. Cell Calcium. 2006; 40: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Regulation of MAS and Glycerol-3-P Dehydrogenase Activity by Extramitochondrial and Intramitochondrial Ca2+-MAS activity was shown to increase in response to extramitochondrial calcium in brain and heart mitochondria (3Palmieri L.

Chem. 2007; 282: 7098-7106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, it became inhibited in a calcium-dependent manner when calcium was allowed to enter the mitochondria through the Ca2+ uniporter (4Pardo B. Contreras L. Serrano A. Ramos M. Kobayashi K.

In brain mitochondria, the remaining activity drops to 79 ± 4%, 58 ± 7%, and 17 ± 3% in the presence of 0, 0.3, and 5 μm [Ca2+]free, respectively (Fig. 1A). MAS inhibition by intramitochondrial Ca2+ is not as large in heart mitochondria, with 77 ± 6% residual activity at 5 μm free calcium (Fig. 1B). In contrast, MAS activity in liver mitochondria is not affected by intramitochondrial Ca2+, as its activity is the same in the absence or presence of RR, although it is activated by extramitochondrial calcium to a smaller extent than in brain or heart (Fig. 1C) as reported earlier (36Contreras L. Gomez-Puertas P. Iijima M. Kobayashi K. Saheki T. Satrustegui J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7098-7106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that the inhibitory effects of matrix Ca2+ on MAS activity are because of Ca2+-induced permeability transition pore opening and loss of mitochondrial metabolites (particularly NAD+) as follows: first, because assays were conducted in the presence of 0.5 mm ADP, which is a known inhibitor of permeability transition pore opening (37Bernardi P. Krauskopf A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Blachly-Dyson E. Di Lisa F. Forte M.A. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2077-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar); second, because inhibition of MAS by Ca2+ matrix was not observed in liver mitochondria (Fig. 1C), which retains half the amount of Ca2+ than brain mitochondria before undergoing permeability transition (38Panov A. Dikalov S. Shalbuyeva N. Hemendinger R. Greenamyre J.T. Rosenfeld J. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C708-C718Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar); and third, because inhibition of MAS by matrix Ca2+ in brain and heart mitochondria is still observed in the presence of 5 μm cyclosporin A (results not shown). We also investigated the effect of extra- and intramitochondrial Ca2+ on mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mitGPDH), the mitochondrial component of the glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle. The activity of this enzyme is known to be activated by low concentrations of extramitochondrial calcium (≈35–100 nm (39Rutter G. Pralong W. Wollheim C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1175: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) through a decrease in the Km value for glycerol 3-phosphate of the mitGPDH (40MacDonald M.J. Brown L.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 41Wernette M.E. Ochs R.S. Lardy H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12767-12771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike MAS, mitGPDH was completely Ca2+-dependent, with no detectable activity in the total absence of free Ca2+ in brain and liver mitochondria (supplemental Fig. 1). The activity of mitGPDH in heart mitochondria was not detectable under the conditions of this study, in agreement with the data of Scholz et al. (42Scholz T.D. Koppenhafer S.L. Pediatr. Res. 1995; 38: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 43Scholz T.D. Koppenhafer S.L. TenEyck C.J. Schutte B.C. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 1605-1613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) who found a marked decrease of glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle activity in the heart with development. The enzyme requires Ca2+ in the intermembrane space, as full activation is obtained in the presence of RR in all tissues. The kinetics of activation agrees with a low S0.5 for activation, as the maximal activity was attained at 0.3 μm free Ca2+ (supplemental Fig. 1). On the other hand, Ca2+ entry in the matrix (i.e. RR not present in the assay) did not affect mitGPDH activity in either brain or liver mitochondria (supplemental Fig. 1). Therefore, the results indicate that in brain mitochondria Ca2+ activation of MAS, but not mitGPDH, is prevented by strong Ca2+ signals that reach mitochondrial matrix. This suggests that reducing equivalents transfer to mitochondria may still proceed through mitGPDH when Ca2+ entry in mitochondria leads to an inhibition of MAS activity. This depends on whether a glycerol-P shuttle is actually present in brain, with its two enzymes within the same cell, as suggested to be the case from the astrocyte and neuronal transcriptome findings (12Lovatt D. Sonnewald U. Waagepetersen H.S. Schousboe A. He W. Lin J.H. Han X. Takano T. Wang S. Sim F.J. Goldman S.A. Nedergaard M. J.

Effect of Extra- and Intramitochondrial Calcium on OGC Activity-The activity of the OGC was studied by measuring the efflux of αKG from mitochondria, in medium containing glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). GDH will transform αKG into glutamate in the presence of NADH and ammonium, resulting in a decrease in NADH fluorescence, when malate is added to trigger αKG efflux from mitochondria (supplemental Fig. 2). The supplemental Fig. 2B shows that the decrease of NADH fluorescence was dependent on the presence of ammonium and was prevented by the OGC inhibitor phenylsuccinate (45McKenna M.C. Waagepetersen H.S. Schousboe A. Sonnewald U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 71: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 47de Bari L. Atlante A. Guaragnella N. Principato G. Passarella S. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To test the effects of both extra- and intramitochondrial calcium on OGC activity, αKG efflux was measured in the absence or presence of the calcium uniporter inhibitor RR, both in Ca2+-free medium or in the presence of 5 μm free Ca2+. In the presence of 200 nm RR, there was no difference in αKG efflux at the two calcium concentrations in brain, heart and liver mitochondria (Table 1), indicating that the OGC is not activated by extramitochondrial Ca2+, in accordance to the lack of calcium-binding motifs in the OGC sequence (48Runswick M. Walker J. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11033-11040Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Effect of intra- and extramitochondrial calcium on the activity of the OGC αKG efflux was measured in brain, heart, and liver mitochondria from 3-month-old C57BL/6xSv129 mice at 0 (i.e. under the Fura2 limit detection, <20 nm) and 5 μm free calcium, in the presence (RR present) or absence (No RR) of 200 nm RR. Data are mean ± S.E. of 4–6 independent experiments performed in duplicate.

Under these conditions the addition of Ca2+ results in a decrease of αKG efflux in mitochondria from brain and heart (to 37 ± 5% and 78 ± 10% residual activity, respectively (Table 1)), indicating that the OGC in these tissues is inhibited by intramitochondrial Ca2+. In liver, the absence of RR resulted in an inhibition of αKG efflux both in the absence or presence of Ca2+ (Table 1), clearly a nonspecific effect, unrelated to Ca2+ entry in mitochondria, which was not studied any further. Therefore, inhibition of αKG efflux by mitochondrial Ca2+ may explain the inhibition of MAS in brain and heart mitochondria. Influence of Mitochondrial αKG Sources and Utilization Pathways on αKG Efflux Along the OGC-OGC and αKGDH have a common substrate, αKG. When mitochondrial Ca2+ increases, it activates αKGDH, which causes a decrease in the Km value for its substrate, αKG, and a decrease in mitochondrial αKG levels (49McCormack J.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1979; 180: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 50Wan B. LaNoue K.F. Cheung J.Y. Scaduto Jr., R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13430-13439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our working hypothesis is that this leads to the decrease in OGC activity that we have shown above in brain and heart mitochondria. As OGC is a member of MAS, this may explain the decrease of MAS activity in brain and heart mitochondria when calcium is allowed to enter the organelle (see Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 2A). We figured that a high OGC activity with respect to αKGDH would make the OGC relatively independent of αKGDH activity, and this could be a possible explanation for the lack of effect of intramitochondrial Ca2+ on liver MAS and OGC activities. However, Table 2 shows that this is not the case. Measurements of αKGDH activity in mitochondria from different tissues showed that the ratio of αKG efflux to αKGDH activity is similar in liver and brain mitochondria.TABLE 2Enzyme and transporter activities involved in αKG production and utilization in mitochondria using glutamate and malate as substrates The results are mean ± S.E. of four independent experiments performed at least in duplicate. αKG production was computed as the sum of AGC-MAS and GDH, whereas αKG utilization was the sum of αKGDH and OGC.

https://openalex.org/W2010182992,"Background DNA barcoding based on the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (cox1 or COI) has been successful in species identification across a wide array of taxa but in some cases failed to delimit the species boundaries of closely allied allopatric species or of hybridising sister species. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we extend the sample size of prior studies in birds for cox1 (2776 sequences, 756 species) and target especially species that are known to occur parapatrically, and/or are known to hybridise, on a Holarctic scale. In order to obtain a larger set of taxa (altogether 2719 species), we include also DNA sequences of two other mitochondrial genes: cytochrome b (cob) (4614 sequences, 2087 species) and 16S (708 sequences, 498 species). Our results confirm the existence of a wide gap between intra- and interspecies divergences for both cox1 and cob, and indicate that distance-based DNA barcoding provides sufficient information to identify and delineate bird species in 98% of all possible pairwise comparisons. This DNA barcoding gap was not statistically influenced by the number of individuals sequenced per species. However, most of the hybridising parapatric species pairs have average divergences intermediate between intraspecific and interspecific distances for both cox1 and cob. Conclusions/Significance DNA barcoding, if used as a tool for species discovery, would thus fail to identify hybridising parapatric species pairs. However, most of them can probably still assigned to known species by character-based approaches, although development of complementary nuclear markers will be necessary to account for mitochondrial introgression in hybridising species."
https://openalex.org/W1970267793,"The vitreous contains a plethora of growth factors that are strongly implicated in the formation of fibroproliferative diseases such as proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Although platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) are present in the vitreous, vitreal growth factors outside of the PDGF family activated the PDGF α receptor (PDGFRα) and promoted disease progression in a rabbit model of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (H. Lei, G. Velez, P. Hovland, T. Hirose, D. Gilbertson, and A. Kazlauskas (2008) submitted for publication.) In this report we investigated the mechanism by which non-PDGFs activated PDGFRα. We found that non-PDGFs increased the cellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that this event was necessary and sufficient for phosphorylation of PDGFRα. We speculated that the underlying mechanism was ROS-mediated inhibition of phosphotyrosine phosphatases, which antagonize receptor auto-phosphorylation. However, this did not appear to be the case. Non-PDGFs promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of catalytically inactive PDGFRα, and thereby indicated that at least one additional tyrosine kinase was involved. Indeed, preventing expression or blocking the kinase activity of Src family kinases suppressed non-PDGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRα. Thus non-PDGFs increased the level of ROS, which activated Src family kinases and resulted in phosphorylation of PDGFRα. Finally, although non-PDGFs induced only modest phosphorylation of PDGFRα, proliferation and survival of cells in response to non-PDGFs was significantly enhanced by expression of PDGFRα. These studies reveal a novel mechanism for activation of PDGFRα that appears capable of enhancing the responsiveness of cells to growth factors outside of the PDGF family.

Analysis of cultured cells and/or mice lacking PDGFs or PDGFRs has provided vast and convincing evidence that PDGF/PDGFRs regulate many cellular responses and thereby contribute to a wide spectrum of physiological processes (3Andrae J. Gallini R. Betsholtz C. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1276-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). Misregulation of PDGF/PDGFR contributes to numerous diseases, including fibrosis in the lung, liver, skin, kidney, heart, and retina (3Andrae J. Gallini R. Betsholtz C.

For instance, proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) occurs as a complication in 3.9–13.7% of patients undergoing surgery to re-attach a detached retina (5Nagasaki H. Ideta H. Uemura A. Morita H.

This is a blinding disease in which the retina re-detaches because of the contraction of a fibroproliferative membrane that forms on the surface of the retina (7Laqua H. Machemer R. Am. J.

Additional evidence for the role of PDGF/PDGFR in PVR includes the observations that cells within the fibroproliferative membrane isolated from patient donors express both PDGF and PDGFRs and that the PDGFRs are activated (14Cui J.Z.

These observations suggest that vitreal PDGFs activate PDGFRs and thereby facilitate the development of PVR. Surprisingly, neutralizing vitreal PDGFs only modestly attenuate experimental PVR, 3H. Lei, G. Velez, P. Hovland, T. Hirose, D. Gilbertson, and A. Kazlauskas (2008) submitted for publication. which suggests that PDGFRs are undergoing activation via a non-traditional route. Indeed, vitreal growth factors outside of the PDGF family promote modest tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRα. 3H. Lei, G. Velez, P. Hovland, T. Hirose, D. Gilbertson, and A. Kazlauskas (2008) submitted for publication. Other investigators have also reported increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRs by agents that are not PDGF. Certain agonists of G protein-coupled receptors, autoantibodies in the blood of scleroderma patients and agents that are within the bone marrow (but are probably not PDGFs) promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFR (31Linseman D.A.

Thus there is a growing appreciation that the direct, PDGF-based mechanism is not the only route to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRs. The goal of this study was to identify the intracellular events and mediators by which non-PDGFs induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRα and to assess whether indirect activation of PDGFRα contributed to cellular responses induced by non-PDGFs. Cell Culture-F, Fα, and FαΔX cells were previously described (4Andrews A. Balciunaite E. Leong F.L. Tallquist M. Soriano P. Refojo M. Kazlauskas A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 2683-2689PubMed Google Scholar).3 Briefly, they are mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from mice null for both pdgfr genes. They were immortalized with SV40 T antigen. Fα and FαΔX cells are F cells in which we re-expressed the human PDGFRα that was the full-length or the mutant lacking the majority of the extracellular domain, respectively. SYF and SYF + Src cells were previously described (39Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Briefly, they are mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from src, yes, and fyn knockout mice. SYFα and SYFα + Src cells were generated by expressing human PDGFRα in SYF and SYF + Src cells, respectively (40Avrov K. Kazlauskas A. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 291: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The SYFα and SYFα + Src cells were used in these studies and are designated as “-/-” and “Src” in Fig. 3. Phα and R627 cells were previously described (41Ikuno Y. Leong F.-L. Kazlauskas A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 483-489PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, they are spontaneously immortalized mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from mice harboring the Ph deletion that includes the pdgfra gene. The wild-type or kinase-inactive human pdgfra cDNA was expressed in parental Ph cells to generate Phα and R627, respectively. ARPE19 (RPE19) cells are a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line that was purchased from American Type Culture Collection. RPE19α cells were generated by expressing PDGFRα in the parental RPE19 cells (15Lei H. Hovland P. Velez G. Haran A. Gilbertson D. Hirose T. Kazlauskas A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which naturally express a very low level of PDGFRα. Primary rabbit conjunctiva fibroblasts were isolated from rabbit conjunctiva as previously described (42Nakagawa M. Refojo M.F. Marin J.F. Doi M. Tolentino F.I. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 2388-2395PubMed Google Scholar). F, Fα, FαΔX, SYFα, SYFα + Src, Phα, R627, and rabbit conjunctiva fibroblast cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, high glucose, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio Products, Calabasas, CA), 500 units/ml penicillin, and 500 μg/ml streptomycin. RPE19 and RPE19α cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham’s F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 500 units/ml penicillin, and 500 μg/ml streptomycin. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Major Reagents-The anti-PDGFRα (27P) antibody was produced and characterized as previously described (43Gelderloos J.A. Rosenkranz S. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5908-5915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The two anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, 4G10 and PY20, were purchased from Upstate and BD Transduction Laboratories (Madison, WI), respectively. Recombinant human PDGF-A and mouse basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were purchased from Peprotech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Antibodies that recognized PDGFRα, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), phospho-src (Tyr-416) were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). The c-Src-2 antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Enhanced chemiluminescent substrate for detection of horseradish peroxidase was from Pierce Protein Research Products (Rockford, IL). N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), 30% H2O2, Tiron, catalase, and 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) were purchased from Sigma. SU6656 (C19H21N3O3S) was purchased from Calbiochem. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot-Cells were grown to 90% confluence and then incubated for 24 h in DMEM or DMEM/F-12 without serum. The cells were exposed to the desired agents as follows: NAC, Tiron: 10 mm for 10 min; Catalase: 144 nm for 10 min; SU6656: 1 μm for 1 h; unless indicated otherwise growth factors were added for 10 min at a concentration of 50 ng/ml for PDGF and 100 ng/ml for bFGF. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then lysed in extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 × g, 4 °C, and PDGFRα was immunoprecipitated from clarified lysates as previously described (15Lei H. Hovland P. Velez G. Haran A. Gilbertson D. Hirose T. Kazlauskas A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitating antibody was a crude rabbit polyclonal (27P). The blotting antibody was a 1:1 mixture of anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10/PY20). The primary blot membrane was stripped and reprobed with the PDGFRα antibody, 27P, or number 3164 from Cell Signaling. At least three independent experiments were performed. Signal intensity was determined by densitometry using Quantity One (Bio-Rad) and normalized for the amount of PDGFRα in each sample (15Lei H. Hovland P. Velez G. Haran A. Gilbertson D. Hirose T. Kazlauskas A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). DCF Assay-Intracellular H2O2 generation was measured indirectly using the fluorescent dye, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), as described by several other groups (44Bae Y.S. Sung J.Y.

Res. 2003; 160: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, serum-deprived RPE19α, rabbit conjunctiva fibroblast, and Fα were stimulated for 10 min with bFGF (100 ng/ml) in DMEM without phenol red or PVR rabbit vitreous. Subsequently the cells were rinsed twice with Krebs-Ringer solution and incubated in Krebs-Ringer solution containing DCFH-DA (5 μm). DCFH-DA is non-polar and readily diffuses into cells, where it is hydrolyzed to the non-fluorescent polar derivative DCFH and thereby trapped within the cells. In the presence of H2O2, DCFH is oxidized to the highly fluorescent DCF. Culture dishes were sealed with paraffin film and placed inaCO2 incubator at 37 °C for 5 min, after which DCF fluorescence was photographed using a Zeiss Axiovert 135 inverted immunofluorescence microscope equipped with a digital camera. To avoid photooxidation of DCF, we collected the fluorescent images at a 9.0-s exposure under green light and identical contrast and brightness parameters for all samples. Cells that were cultured in 96-well plates and treated in the same way were read with a Bio-Tek fluorescence plate reader at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 528 nm, respectively. Cell Proliferation Assay-Cells (F, Fα, and FαΔX) were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 60,000 cells/well in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum. After 8 h the cells had attached; the medium was aspirated, the cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM and treated with certain reagents as follows: 1) DMEM only; 2) bFGF (1, 4, 20, 100, and 200 ng/ml); 3) bFGF (20 ng/ml) plus NAC (10 mm); 4) PDGF-A (50 ng/ml); and 5) PDGF-A plus NAC (10 mm). The media were replaced every day. The cells were counted in a hemocytometer on days 1, 2, 3, and 4, and at least three independent experiments were performed. Apoptosis Assay-Cells were seeded into 10 cm-dishes at a density of 2 × 105 cells per dish in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum. After the cells had attached the dishes, they were treated as described above under “Cell Proliferation Assay.” On Day 3, the cells were harvested and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide according to the instructions provided with the apoptosis kit (BD Biosciences). The cells were analyzed by flow cytometry in Coulter Beckman XL (47Lei H. Romeo G. Kazlauskas A. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 902-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). At least three independent experiments were performed. The raw data from a representative experiment are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. Statistics-All data were analyzed using the unpaired t test. p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Non-PDGF-triggered Tyrosine Phosphorylation of PDGFRα was Dependent on ROS-It has been demonstrated that increasing the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of many proteins, including the PDGF β receptor (PDGFRβ) (48Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar). Consequently, we tested if non-PDGFs increased ROS, and whether this event was likely to be involved with tyrosine phosphorylation of the closely related PDGFRα. In these experiments we used vitreous from normal rabbits (instead of rabbits with PVR) to mimic the conditions at the start of the disease. Unlike the vitreous from rabbits with PVR, vitreous from normal rabbits had undetectable amounts of PDGFs, although it did have a variety of growth factors outside of the PDGF family (15Lei H. Hovland P. Velez G. Haran A. Gilbertson D. Hirose T. Kazlauskas A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 (A and B) shows that either rabbit vitreous, or bFGF (a representative vitreal non-PDGF), increased the level of ROS in three cell lines that are highly relevant to experimental and/or clinical PVR. Furthermore, exogenously added hydrogen peroxide strongly stimulated phosphorylation of PDGFRα (Fig. 1C), indicating that a rise in ROS was sufficient to increase the phosphotyrosine content of PDGFRα. Pretreating cells with anti-oxidants NAC or Tiron (10 mm for 10 min), or an enzyme that scavenges H2O2 (catalase, 144 nm, for 10 min) prevented non-PDGFs and H2O2 from phosphorylating PDGFRα (Fig. 1C). In contrast, direct activation of PDGFRα and FGFR1 was unaffected by antioxidants (Fig. 1, C and D). These results indicate that ROS was produced in response to non-PDGFs and was required for them to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRα. One of the mechanisms by which ROS could increase tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRα is by inactivating phosphotyrosine phosphatases that dephosphorylate autophosphorylated PDGFRα (49Meng T.C. Fukada T. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 50Klinghoffer A.R. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22208-22217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To test this ROS/phosphotyrosine phosphatase hypothesis we determined if non-PDGFs induced tyrosine phosphorylation of kinase-inactive PDGFRα, which is incapable of autophosphorylating (51Rosenkranz S. Kazlauskas A. Growth Factors. 1999; 16: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Using a previously characterized pair of cell lines that expressed either the wild-type or kinase-inactive (R627) PDGFRα (51Rosenkranz S. Kazlauskas A. Growth Factors. 1999; 16: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we found that there was no difference in the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of the two receptors in response to any of the three agents that promoted receptor phosphorylation in an ROS-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). As expected, direct activation of PDGFRα via PDGF increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the wild-type, but not R627 PDGFRα (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis of total cell lysates prepared from the two cell lines indicated that the wild-type and R627 PDGFRα were expressed to similar levels (Fig. 2B). These findings indicate that the ROS/phosphotyrosine phosphatase hypothesis was either incorrect or incomplete. Furthermore, the mechanism by which non-PDGFs increased phosphorylation of PDGFRα involved a kinase that was not PDGFRα itself. SFKs Were Required for Non-PDGF-dependent Tyrosine Phosphorylation of PDGFRα-We considered whether this kinase was an Src family kinase (SFK), because SFKs can be activated by hydrogen peroxide (52Hardwick J.S. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4527-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 53Abe J. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.D. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20389-20394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and have many substrates, including PDGFRs (54Hansen K. Johnell M. Siegbahn A. Rorsman C. Engstrom U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.H. Ronnstrand L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5299-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). All of the agents that promoted phosphorylation of PDGFRα activated c-Src (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, phosphorylation of PDGFRα induced by bFGF, rabbit vitreous (RV) or hydrogen peroxide was either undetectable or severely attenuated in mouse embryo fibroblasts that lacked SFKs (SYF cells, “-/-”) (Fig. 3B). Re-expression of c-Src restored phosphorylation of PDGFRα by all three agents without altering the expression level of PDGFRα (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast (and consistent with previous observations (39Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar)), direct activation of PDGFRα did not require expression of SFKs (Fig. 3B). Similarly, pharmacologically inhibiting SFKs had no effect on PDGF-dependent phosphorylation of PDGFRα, yet it blocked non-PDGF-dependent phosphorylation of PDGFRα (Fig. 4). These results identify SFKs as an intracellular mediator of non-PDGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRα. Indirect Activation of PDGFRα Promoted Proliferation and Survival of Cells in Response to Non-PDGFs-Although direct activation of PDGFRs robustly induced cellular responses such as proliferation and survival, whether the modest increase in the phosphotyrosine content of PDGFRα induced by non-PDGFs was also capable of doing so was an open question. Previous investigators found that non-PDGF-triggered signaling events related to cell proliferation and survival (activation of Akt) were enhanced by expression of PDGFRα (55Zhang H. Bajraszewski N. Wu E. Wang H. Moseman A.P. Dabora S.L. Griffin J.D. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 730-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The increase in such signaling events may be sufficient to enhance cellular responses. To test this idea we considered if indirect activation of PDGFRα promoted cellular responses by comparing bFGF-induced cell proliferation and survival in cells that did or did not express PDGFRα. A dose response experiment indicated that both responses plateaued at 20 ng/ml bFGF (Fig. 5A and 6A). bFGF-induced proliferation was enhanced by expression of full-length PDGFRα (Fig. 5B and Table 1). When we assessed apoptosis in this panel of cell lines we observed enhanced survival (reduced apoptosis) under both basal and bFGF-stimulated conditions in the PDGFRα-expressing cells as compared with the non-expressing cells (Fig. 6B and Table 1). The enhanced survival in the absence of exogenously added growth factors may by due to indirect activation of PDGFRα by endogenously produced factors. Cultured cells produce growth factors (56Janes K.A. Albeck J.G. Gaudet S. Sorger P.K. Lauffenburger D.A. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2005; 310: 1646-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), and PDGFRα can be indirectly activated by a variety of such factors.3 We concluded that expression of PDGFRα enabled enhanced proliferation and survival in response to non-PDGFs such as bFGF.FIGURE 6Expression of PDGFRα promoted non-PDGF-driven survival. The indicated cells were seeded at a density of 200,000 cells/10-cm dish. The cells were permitted to attach, and after two rinses with phosphate-buffered saline, serum-free medium was added that was (+) or was not (-) supplemented with bFGF. The media were replaced every day. On day 3 the cells were harvested, stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells in early apoptosis were defined as the population that was positive for Annexin V, but negative for propidium iodide.

https://openalex.org/W2126104879,"Rac GTPases are members of the Rho family regulating the actin cytoskeleton and implicated in neuronal development. Ubiquitous Rac1 and neuron-specific Rac3 GTPases are coexpressed in the developing mammalian brain. We used Cre-mediated conditional deletion of Rac1 in neurons combined with knockout of neuron-specific Rac3 to study the role of these GTPases in neural development. We found that lack of both genes causes motor behavioral defects, epilepsy, and premature death of mice. Deletion of either GTPase does not produce evident phenotypes. Double-knockout mice show specific defects in the development of the hippocampus. Selective impairment of the dorsal hilus of double-knockout animals is associated with alteration in the formation of the hippocampal circuitry. Axonal pathways to and from the dorsal hilus are affected because of the deficit of hilar mossy cells. Moreover, analysis of Rac function in hippocampal cultures shows that spine formation is strongly hampered only in neurons lacking both Rac proteins. These findings show for the first time that both Rac1 and Rac3 are important for the development of the nervous system, wherein they play complementary roles during late stages of neuronal and brain development."
https://openalex.org/W2077007966,"Background Previous studies have shown that women increase their preference for masculinity during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle. Evidence for a similar preference shift for symmetry is equivocal. These studies have required participants to choose between subtle variations in computer-generated stimuli, and preferences for more natural stimuli have not been investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings Our study employed photographs of individual males to investigate women's preferences for face and body masculinity and symmetry across the menstrual cycle. We collected attractiveness ratings from 25 normally cycling women at high- and low-fertility days of the menstrual cycle. Attractiveness ratings made by these women were correlated with independent ratings of masculinity and symmetry provided by different sets of raters. We found no evidence for any cyclic shift in female preferences. Correlations between attractiveness and masculinity, and attractiveness and symmetry did not differ significantly between high- and low-fertility test sessions. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between high- and low-fertility ratings of attractiveness. Conclusions These results suggest that a menstrual cycle shift in visual preferences for masculinity and symmetry may be too subtle to influence responses to real faces and bodies, and subsequent mate-choice decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2152746379,"Resistin antagonizes insulin action in mouse, making it a potential therapeutic target for treating metabolic diseases such as diabetes. To better understand how mouse resistin gene (Retn) expression is restricted to fat tissue, we identified an adipocyte-specific enhancer located approximately 8.8-kb upstream of the transcription start site. This region contains a binding site for the master adipogenic regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), and binds endogenous PPARgamma together with its partner retinoid-X receptor alpha (RXRalpha). It also contains three binding sites for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), and is bound by endogenous C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta in adipocytes. Exogenous expression of PPARgamma/RXRalpha and C/EBPalpha in non-adipocyte cells synergistically drives robust expression from the enhancer. Although PPARgamma ligands repress Retn transcription in adipocytes, rosiglitazone paradoxically stimulates the enhancer activity, suggesting that the enhancer is not directly involved in negative regulation. Unlike expression of Retn in mouse, human resistin (RETN) is expressed primarily in macrophages. Interestingly, the region homologous to the mouse Retn enhancer in the human gene contains all three C/EBP elements, but is not conserved for the sequence bound by PPARgamma. Furthermore, it displays little or no binding by PPARgamma in vitro. Taken together, the data suggest that a composite enhancer binding both PPARgamma and C/EBP factors confers adipocyte-specific expression to Retn in mouse, and its absence from the human gene may explain the lack of adipocyte expression in humans."

We observed association with MS in 6 of 8 SNPs. The rs1570538, at the 3'- UTR extreme of the gene, previously reported to have a weak association with MS, is replicated here (P = 0.032). The most associated T1D SNP (rs41295061) was not associated with MS in the present study. However, the rs35285258, belonging to another independent group of SNPs associated with T1D, showed the maximal association in this study but different risk allele. We replicated the association of only one (rs2104286) of the two IL2RA SNPs identified in the recently performed genome-wide association study of MS.These findings confirm and extend the association of this gene with MS and reveal a genetic heterogeneity of the associated polymorphisms and risk alleles between MS and T1D suggesting different immunopathological roles of IL2RA in these two diseases."

As a member of nuclear receptor superfamily (NR), AR is a modular protein, containing an N-terminal domain, a DNA binding domain, and a multifunctional C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) (3Gelmann E.P. J. Clin. Oncol. 2002; 20: 3001-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Like other NRs, transcriptional regulation by AR is believed to be mediated coordinately through accessory cofactors, termed coactivators or corepressors (4McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar, 5Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 6Wang L. Hsu C.L.

The coactivators facilitate transcriptional activation through diverse mechanisms, including functioning as bridging factors between receptors and basal transcription machinery to enhance recruitment of the basal transcription machinery and/or as factors that have the capacity to actively remodel repressive chromatin (7Roeder R.G.

The identification and characterization of AR cofactors have played a central role in advancing our understanding of molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation by AR.

For example, the mediator complex, also known as TRAP and DRIP, was isolated as liganded thyroid hormone receptor and vitamin D receptor-associated protein complex, respectively (17Fondell J.D. Ge H. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8329-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 25Rachez C. Suldan Z. Ward J. Chang C.P. Burakov D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1787-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The mediator complex is believed to coordinate with other cofactors to regulate the recruitment of RNA polymerase II. In this regard, biochemical purification of AR-associated protein complex(es) so far has resulted in only limited success. Only one protein, p44, was identified in a previous effort of biochemical purification of AR-associated proteins (24Hosohata K. Li P. Hosohata Y. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Wang Z. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 7019-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). p44 was shown to enhance AR transcriptional activation both in vitro and in cells. This limited success may result from dissociation of AR-interacting proteins during cell lysis and/or purification process. In this study, we have employed a reversible cross-linking-based approach to capture AR·protein complexes in cells treated with or without synthetic AR ligand R1881. We then isolated AR complex(es) by immunoaffinity purification and identified AR-associated proteins by mass spectrometry. In addition to known coactivators such as the human BAF complex (SWI/SNF), we identified DBC1, a protein initially identified as “deleted in breast cancer 1” (26Hamaguchi M. Meth J.L. von Klitzing C. Wei W. Esposito D. Rodgers L. Walsh T. Welcsh P. King M.C. Wigler M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13647-13652Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 27Sundararajan R. Chen G. Mukherjee C. White E. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4908-4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), as an AR-interacting protein. We demonstrated that DBC1 interacts with AR in a ligand-stimulated manner and facilitates AR transcriptional activity. The interaction between DBC1 and AR was mapped to the AR ligand binding domain and DBC1 N-terminal region. RNA interference experiments showed that DBC1 was required for optimal transcriptional activation of AR target genes in LNCaP cells and binding of AR to the PSA enhancer. In vitro, recombinant DBC1 facilitated AR DNA-binding activity in gel mobility shift assays. Taken together, our data have identified DBC1 as a novel AR coactivator. Plasmid Constructs and Antibodies-The reporter plasmids MMTV-LTR-CAT and MMTV-Luc were previously described (28Huang Z. Li J. Wong J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 924-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To generate a doxycycline-inducible stable cell line expressing C-terminal FLAG-tagged AR, the full-length AR was cloned into a modified pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector (Invitrogen) containing two tandem FLAG tags. Full-length DBC1 in pcDNA3.1 was also cloned into the pSG5-FLAG vector for expression of FLAG-DBC1, MS2 vector for expression of proteins in Xenopus oocytes (29Wong J. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3158-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and pFastBac for expression of recombinant DBC1 in SF9 cells. DBC1-(aa1–265) was generated by cloning the corresponding cDNA fragment into pSG5-FLAG, whereas DBC1-(aa266–923) and DBC1-(aa1–793) were cloned into pSG5-HA vector. For knocking down of DBC1 in HeLa cells, we also generated sh-DBC1–1 and sh-DBC1–2 constructs in pSUPER vector (OligoEngine) according to the company protocol using the following sequences: shDBC1–1F (GATCCCCCCAGCTTGCATGACTACTTTTCAAGAGAAAGTAGTCATGCAAGCTGGTTTTTA), shDBC1–1R (GGGGGTCGAACGTACTGATGAAAAGTTCTCTTTCATCAGTACGTTCGACCAAAAATTCGA), shDBC1–2F (GATCCCCGCAGACACTTCTAGACGGATTCAAGAGATCCGTCTAGAAGTGTCTGCTTTTTA), and shDBC1–2R (GGGCGTCTGTGAAGATCTGCCTAAGTTCTCTAGGCAGATCTTCACAGACGAAAAATTCGA). For in vitro pulldown assays, different truncated DBC1 and ARLBD were cloned into the pGEX4T-1 vector, and GST fusion proteins were purified using a kit from Amersham Biosciences. All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. DBC1 antibody was generated by immunizing rabbit using recombinant GST-DBC1 (aa 266–375). The AR antibodies N-20 and C-19 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. BRG1 (07–476) and HA tag antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). FLAG tag antibody was purchased from Sigma. Antibodies against SRC-1, SRC2, and SRC-3 were as previously described (30Li J. O'Malley B.W. Wong J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Generation of the AR-inducible Stable Cell Line-A stable FLAG-AR cell line was generated using the 293T Flp-In T-Rex cell line and Flp-In™-T-REx™ system from Invitrogen according to the manufacturer’s instructions essentially as described (31Fu J. Yoon H.G. Qin J. Wong J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 4641-4651Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Protein-Protein Cross-linking Using DSP-To capture AR·cofactor complexes in cells, we made use of short arm cross-linking reagent dithiobis[succinimidylpropionate] (DSP) from Pierce (no. 22585). DSP is a water-insoluble, membrane-permeable homobifunctional N-hydroxysuccimide ester, which can cross-link different proteins by primary amines in cells. The FLAG-AR 293T Flp-In T-Rex stable cell line was cultured in the Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with charcoal-stripped serum for 2 days to consume steroids in the medium. Doxycycline was added to the medium at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml, and the cells were incubated overnight to induce FLAG-AR expression. The cells were then treated without or with R1881 (50 nm) for 2 h to induce the formation of AR·cofactor complexes. The cells were collected by EDTA-trypsin and washed twice with cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline buffer. The cross-linking with DSP (20 mm) was carried out in 1× phosphate-buffered saline buffer at room temperature for 30 min. Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was then added at the final concentration of 20 mm and incubated for 15 min to stop the cross-linking reaction. The cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed with high salt EBC buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 0.2% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol plus a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). The lysates were sonicated three times for 15 s each time on ice at 40% output (Branson Sonifier 250), and clean extracts were obtained after centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. Purification of Human AR Complex from a Stable Cell Line-The clean extracts were diluted 2-fold with dilution buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA) before being used for complex purification (2 mg of proteins/ml). Approximately 50 μl of ANTI-FLAG® M2-agarose (Sigma) was added to the extract (5 ml), and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C with rotation for 2 h. The affinity resins were washed five times with Wash Buffer I (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 400 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, plus protease inhibitor mixture) and once with Wash Buffer II (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). The cross-linking was reversed upon treatment at 95 °C for 5 min in SDS-loading buffer. The proteins were separated with a 4–20% SDS-PAGE, stained with Imperial Protein Stain (Pierce cat. no. 24615) and processed for identification by mass spectrometry as described previously (32Qin J. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 4002-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting-Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were essentially as described previously (31Fu J. Yoon H.G. Qin J. Wong J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 4641-4651Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Microinjection of Xenopus Oocytes and Primer Extension-Preparation and microinjection of mRNA and reporter DNA into stage VI Xenopus oocytes were performed as previously described (33Li J. Fu J. Toumazou C. Yoon H.G. Wong J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 776-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The preparation of single-stranded reporter DNA for Xenopus oocyte injection was essentially as described (34Wong J. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2696-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). All capped polyadenylated mRNAs used for injection were synthesized using a SP6 Message Machine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). In vitro synthesized mRNA was injected at a concentration of 100–400 ng/μl (18.4 nl/oocyte), and reporter plasmid in single strand DNA form was injected at a concentration of 50 ng/μl (18.4 nl/oocyte) according to the experimental scheme described in each figure. Primer extension was used to analyze the quantity of RNA transcripts produced form reporter genes in Xenopus oocytes. The procedure used for primer extension has been previously described (33Li J. Fu J. Toumazou C. Yoon H.G. Wong J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 776-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The Xenopus oocyte storage histone H4 mRNA was used as an internal control in all primer extension assays. Cell Culture and Short Hairpin RNA in a Stable Cell Line-HeLa cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics at 37 °C under 5% CO2. HeLa cells were seeded the night before transfection at such a density that cells reach ∼30–40% confluence by the time of transfection. The transfection of pSUPER vector, sh-DBC1–1, and sh-DBC1–2 constructs against DBC1 were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Two days after transfection, the cells were re-plated and selected for stable clones in the presence of antibiotics puromycin. The pool of clones was selected, and the efficiency of the short hairpin RNA knockdown was determined by Western blotting analysis using DBC1 antibody. For luciferase assay, the stable control pSUPER- and shDBC1-1-transfected cells were transfected with pSG5-AR and MMTV-luciferase reporter. 6 h after transfection, the cells were treated with R1881 (50 nm) for overnight, and the cells were harvested for measuring the luciferase activity. Real-time PCR-Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and the ABI Prism 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR reactions were performed under conditions standardized for each primer. Standard curves were generated using 10-fold dilutions of standard plasmids. Primers for quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the PSA, NKX3.1 (NK3 homeobox 1), and TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease, serine 2) mRNAs were as follow: PSA, 5-GGAAATGACCAGGCCAAGAC-3 and 5′-CAACCCTGGACCTCACACCTA-3′; NKX3.1, 5-TGAAGGCGCAGGCTTACTG-3 and 5′-TAGGCTGCCTTCTTTTCCATGT-3′; and TMPRSS2, 5-TGGCAGGGCGCCAA-3 and 5′-TCAATTTCCAGTGACTAGCAG-3′. The 18 S RNA was used as internal control, and all samples were first normalized to 18 S RNA. The SMARTpool siRNA against DBC1 was purchased from Dharmacon. To knock down DBC1 in LNCaP cells, LNCaP cells were transfected with 20 nm siDBC1 for 2 days. A scrambled siRNA (siCon) served as a control. The transfected cells were treated with or without 50 nm R1881 for 8 h before being collected for quantitative RT-PCR analysis or 2 h for ChIP assays. Gel Mobility Shift Assay-DNA binding was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay for AR under the conditions as described previously (28Huang Z. Li J. Wong J. Mol.

The binding reactions also contained 0.5 μg of competitor poly(dI-dC) (Sigma). AR and DBC1 were purified from Sf9 cells (amounts per assay are indicated in the figure legends) were added into 12 μl of DNA binding buffer (20 mm Tris-base (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton, 10% glycerol and 0.2 nm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). All components of the binding reaction were preincubated for 10 min at 4 °C prior to addition of labeled probe. After 20 min, DNA binding reactions were electrophoresed on 4% polyacrylamide (40:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio) gels in 0.5× Tris acetate/EDTA buffer in cold room. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay-ChIP assays using injected Xenopus oocytes were performed exactly as previously described (33Li J. Fu J. Toumazou C. Yoon H.G. Wong J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 776-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The PCR primers for ChIP assay of MMTV-LTR-CAT reporter are 5′-CCAATCTTGGTTCCCAAGGTTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTTAGGACTGTTGCAAGTTTACT-3′ (reverse). For ChIP assay in LNCaP cells, the cells were cultured in charcoal-stripped serum medium for 3 days before treatment with R1881 (50 nm) for 2 h. The ChIP assay was performed essentially as described (35Yoon H.G. Wong J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 1048-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Standard PCR was performed in 20-μl volumes with the inclusion of 1 μCi of [32P]dATP. The products were visualized by autoradiography. The PCR (94 °C for 45 s, 63 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s) consisted of 20 cycles for DNA from oocytes and 25 cycles for DNA from mammalian cells. Identification of DBC1 as an AR-interacting Protein-To isolate AR cofactors through a biochemical approach, we first established a stable inducible FLAG-AR expression cell line using the 293T Flp-In T-Rex cell line and Flp-In™-T-REx™ system from Invitrogen (data not shown) and a scheme outlined in Fig. 1A. The expression of FLAG-AR (see “Experimental Procedures”) was induced by 0.5 μg/ml doxycycline overnight and followed by treatment with or without 50 nm AR synthetic ligand R1881 for 2 h. The cells were then treated with 20 mm DSP, a reversible cross-linking reagent, and processed for affinity purification of FLAG-AR and associated proteins using anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads. After reversing cross-linking, the resulting FLAG-AR complexes were resolved by a 4–20% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1B). A number of bands were found to differentially associate with liganded and unliganded AR. These bands were excised, in gel digested with trypsin, and their identities were determined by mass spectrometry. The results (Fig. 1B, right panel) show that the proteins that were preferentially associated with liganded AR are mainly BRG1 and BAF proteins, the components of human BAF or SWI/SNF complexes (36Wang W. Cote J. Xue Y. Zhou S. Khavari P.A. Biggar S.R. Muchardt C. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Yaniv M. Workman J.L. Crabtree G.R.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The ligand-dependent interaction between AR and SWI/SNF has been reported previously (20Link K.A. Burd C.J. Williams E. Marshall T. Rosson G. Henry E. Weissman B. Knudsen K.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 2200-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 38Huang Z.Q. Li J. Sachs L.M. Cole P.A. Wong J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2146-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Consistent with the general concept that unliganded AR forms complexes with heat shock proteins and ligand treatment induces the dissociation of heat shock proteins, the bands (i and j) that became weaker after ligand treatment were identified as Hsp90, Hsp72, and Hsp70. Together these data validated our experimental approach. In addition to aforementioned proteins, we identified DBC1 (band f) as a protein co-purified only with liganded FLAG-AR (band h). The DBC1 gene, also called KIAA1967, was initially isolated in an effort to identify candidate tumor suppressor gene(s) located in the human chromosome 8p21 region that is frequently deleted in breast cancer. Subsequent study revealed that deletion of DBC1 is not linked to breast cancer but rather implicated another gene deleted in breast cancer 2 (DBC2) as a breast tumor suppressor (26Hamaguchi M. Meth J.L. von Klitzing C. Wei W. Esposito D. Rodgers L. Walsh T. Welcsh P. King M.C. Wigler M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13647-13652Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). DBC1 encodes a 923-amino acid nuclear protein. Interestingly, DBC1 was shown to be processed during apoptosis, and this caspase-dependent processing of DBC1 may act as a feed-forward mechanism to promote apoptosis (27Sundararajan R. Chen G. Mukherjee C. White E. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4908-4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We first verified the mass data of DBC1 by Western analysis using a DBC1-specific antibody. Consistent with the mass data, Fig. 1C shows that DBC1 was detected in the purified FLAG-AR complexes derived from R1881-treated cells. To further validate this association, we co-transfected FLAG-AR and DBC1 into HeLa cells and analyzed their interaction by IP-Western analysis in the absence of DSP treatment. The result in Fig. 1D shows that more DBC1 was co-precipitated with FLAG-AR in IP with FLAG antibody from the cells treated with R1881. To further test the interaction between the endogenous DBC1 and AR, we also performed IP-Western analysis using cell extracts derived from prostate cancer LNCaP cells treated with or without R1881. The result in Fig. 1E shows again an R1881-stimulated association between DBC1 and AR. DBC1 Interacts Directly with AR-Next we analyzed whether DBC1 interacts directly or indirectly with AR. As abundant SWI/SNF components were co-purified with liganded AR (Fig. 1B), DBC1 might indirectly interact with AR through its association with SWI/SNF or an unidentified protein. Although mass analysis did not detect the presence of SRC/p160 family proteins in the liganded AR complexes, we detected their presence by Western analysis (data not shown). We thus immunoprecipitated HeLa nuclear extracts with antibodies against members of SRC/p160 family coactivators and SWI/SNF and analyzed the presence of DBC1. Fig. 1F shows that DBC1 did not co-precipitate with SRC-1, SRC-2, or SRC-3, or with BRG1 or SNF5, two subunits of human SWI/SNF. As a positive control, BRG1 was abundantly detected in the precipitates with antibodies against BRG1 and SNF5. Together these results indicate that DBC1 is neither associated with the SRC/p160 members nor SWI/SNF, suggesting that DBC1 is likely to interact directly with liganded AR. To test whether DBC1 interacts directly with liganded AR, we first expressed FLAG-tagged AR mutants with either deletion of the AR N-terminal domain or the C-terminal ligand binding domain (Fig. 2A) in HeLa cells. The resulting cell extracts were mixed with 35S-labeled, in vitro synthesized DBC1 in the presence of absence of 100 nm R1881 and immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-FLAG antibody. We found that 35S-DBC1 was co-precipitated with the C-terminal ligand binding domain but not with AR N-terminal domain (Fig. 2A). In addition, we found that DBC1 bound to GST-ARLBD but not to control GST in in vitro pulldown assays (data not shown, see Fig. 2, B and C). These data support a direct interaction between AR and DBC1. We next defined the AR interaction domain in DBC1. A series of DBC1 deletion mutants (27Sundararajan R. Chen G. Mukherjee C. White E. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4908-4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was synthesized and labeled with [35S]methionine, and their interaction with AR was tested using GST-ARLBD in in vitro pulldown assays. The results show that deletion of the N-terminal region, including the nuclear localization signal and the leucine zipper abrogated the interaction, whereas deletion of the C-terminal coiled-coil and EF-hand domains had no effect (Fig. 2B). The N-terminal region (aa 1–265) was not only necessary (Fig. 2C) but also sufficient for binding of GST-ARLBD (Fig. 3B). In a reciprocal experiment, in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled AR was able to bind GST-DBC1 fusion containing amino acids 1–298 but not to control GST (Fig. 2D). Taken together, we conclude that DBC1 interacts directly with AR, and this interaction involves AR LBD and the N-terminal region (aa 1–265) of DBC1. DBC1 Functions as an AR Coactivator-Having established that DBC1 interacts with AR in a ligand-dependent manner, we next analyzed whether DBC-1 modulated AR transcriptional activity. We co-transfected HeLa cells with an MMTV-LTR-driven luciferase reporter and AR expression vector in the absence or presence of DBC1. Two days after transfection, the cells were treated with or without 50 nm R1881 overnight and assayed for luciferase activity. A representative result in Fig. 3 shows that addition of DBC1 enhanced AR transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner. Under the same conditions, we also analyzed the ability for various DBC1 deletion mutants to enhance AR activation. We found that, although DBC1-(1–265) is sufficient to interact with AR (Fig. 2), it was not able to facilitate AR activation (Fig. 3). Western analysis using FLAG antibody showed that DBC1 and DBC1-(1–265) were expressed to a similar level. On the other hand, deletion of the N-terminal AR interaction domain also impaired the DBC1 coactivator activity, whereas deletion of the C-terminal coiled-coil domain slightly reduced the coactivator activity. Again, Western analysis showed that both deletion mutants were expressed to comparable levels (Fig. 3, lower panel). Together these results indicate that interaction with AR is required for DBC1 to facilitate AR transcriptional activation. To further assess the role of DBC1 in AR transcriptional activation,"

Regulation of PC and phosphoinositide metabolism by Sec14 is hypothesized to provide the appropriate membrane environment for fission of vesicles from the trans-Golgi, although the precise step(s) where Sec14 regulates vesicular transport has yet to be determined.

Sec14 domains from higher eukaryotes are often embedded as part of a larger protein, many of which are guanine exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), indicating that regulation of small G protein activity is a unifying theme for several members of the Sec14 superfamily. Human Sec14 domains bind hydrophobic ligands, including phospholipids (16Curwin A.J. McMaster C.R. Future Lipidol. 2008; 3: 399-410Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this study, we used synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis to determine more precisely how S. cerevisiae Sec14 regulates vesicular transport. Genetic interactions were observed between a SEC14 allele with reduced function and GTPases that regulate vesicular transport in and out of the Golgi via endosomes. This is the first instance of Sec14 regulating import into the Golgi. A main route for fusion of endosome-derived vesicles with the trans-Golgi is facilitated by the t-SNARE Tlg2 (23Panic B. Whyte J.R. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 405-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Tlg2, along with Vps45 (a protein of the Sec1/Munc18 family), tethers endosome-derived vesicles to the trans-Golgi to facilitate membrane fusion (23Panic B. Whyte J.R. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 405-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The tethering complex that directly interacts with Tlg2 is the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex. The GARP complex is composed of four subunits Vps51-54 (23Panic B. Whyte J.R. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 405-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The GARP complex directly interacts with Ypt6 (a Rab GTPase) and Arl1 (an Arf-like GTPase) that together comprise the two main routes for endosome fusion with the trans-Golgi. Ypt6 is activated by a heterodimeric GEF comprised of Ric1 and Rgp1. The GEF for Arl1 is unclear; however, the localization of Arl1 to the Golgi is dependent on Arl3 and Sys1 (24Behnia R. Panic B. Whyte J.R. Munro S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 25Setty S.R. Strochlic T.I. Tong A.H. Boone C. Burd C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Arl3 is also an Arf-like GTPase, whereas Sys1 is an integral membrane protein that targets Arl3 to the Golgi. A second Golgi-associated tethering complex is the transport protein particle (TRAPP). TRAPP I regulates early Golgi events in part by acting as a GEF for the Rab Ypt1. TRAPP II is specific for transport in and out of the trans-Golgi and is a GEF for the Rab pair Ypt31/32 (Fig. 1B) (26Cai H. Zhang Y. Pypaert M. Walker L. Ferro-Novick S. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). TRAPP I and II share seven subunits (Bet3, Bet5, Trs20, Trs23, Trs31, Trs33, and Trs35) with three subunits (Trs65, Trs120, and Trs130) added to form TRAPP II. Sec14 has previously been implied to globally regulate vesicular transport out of the Golgi. Our genetic screen dramatically expanded the network of genes required for vesicular transport when Sec14 function is impaired, including those comprising GARP and TRAPP complexes. The results from the genetic screen prompted us to examine the role of Sec14 in multiple vesicular transport routes. We report that Sec14 regulates a subset of vesicular transport pathways out of the trans-Golgi. The genetic analysis, coupled with assessments of vesicular transport pathways, go on to indicate that a primary function of Sec14 is regulation of vesicular transport through endosomes. We also demonstrate that ligand binding by Sec14 differentially regulates function. Synthetic Genetic Array Screen-SGA analysis was performed essentially as described (27Fairn G.D. McMaster C.R.

CMY503 (contains a temperature-sensitive SEC14 allele, sec14ts) was mated with 4,800 S. cerevisiae single gene deletion strains at 25 °C; diploids were selected, and cells were sporulated for 5 days at 25 °C. To ensure that the haploid cells obtained were from mated diploids, cells were selected for histidine prototrophy followed by growth on medium containing G418 and nourseothricin. The resulting haploids were incubated at 25 or 35 °C. Three independent screens were performed. Mutants whose inactivation resulted in decreased growth when in combination with the sec14ts allele in at least two of three screens were subjected to random spore analysis to determine whether the genetic interactions observed were true. Yeast Strain Construction-The sec14ts allele linked to the nourseothricin drug resistance cassette was constructed as follows (mutated sites in primer sequences are underlined). Plasmid-borne SEC14 was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to convert Gly-266 to Asp using primers 5′-CTTACCAGTCAAATTTGGCGATAAGTCTGAAGTTGATGATCA-3′ and 5′-GATTCATCAACTTCAGACTTATCGCCAAATTTGACTGGTAAG-3′. This mutation confers temperature sensitivity to Sec14. To insert the natMX4 cassette next to the sec14ts gene, an SphI site was generated 300 bp downstream of the SEC14 stop codon by site-directed mutagenesis with the primers 5′-GGCAGTATATACATTTATCTTATAGAATACGCATGCACGTATTAAACAATAAAAAGAACATAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTATGTTCTTTTTATTGTTTAATACGTGCATGCGTATTCTATAAGATAAATGTATATACTGCC-3′. The natMX4 cassette was amplified with SphI sites at each end using primers 5′-CTGAGAGCATGCACATGGAGGCCCAGAATACCC-3′ and 5′-CTGAGAGCATGCCAGTATAGCGACCAGCATTCAC-3′. An SphI site in the natMX4 DNA sequence was removed by site-directed mutagenesis (without changing the amino acid sequence) using primers 5′-CGCTCTACATGAGTATGCCCTGCCCCTA-3′ and 5′-TAGGGGCAGGGCATACTCATGTAGAGCG-3′, and this DNA fragment was subcloned into the SphI site downstream of the sec14ts open reading frame. The sec14ts:natMX4 disruption cassette was PCR-amplified from the resulting vector using primers 5′-CCTTTCTTGGATCCAGTCACTG-3′ and 5′-GGCATGGACTTGATATCCTAG-3′ to give a fragment containing both the sec14ts mutation and the natMX4 cassette along with 5′ and 3′ SEC14-flanking DNA. This DNA fragment was transformed into the Y2454 yeast strain to replace the SEC14 gene with the sec14ts allele linked to the natMX4 cassette to generate strain CMY503 (MATα mfa1Δ::MFA1pr-HIS3 can1Δ0 ura3Δ0 leu2Δ0 his3Δ1 lys2Δ0 sec14ts:natMX4). The sec14ts:natMX4 cassette was transformed into the indicated strains for the construction of isogenic sets of sec14ts containing yeast (Table 1). Strain genotypes were confirmed by genomic PCR and/or genomic Southern blot using the digoxygenin High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Kit II (Roche Applied Science).TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceBY4741MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0EUROSCARFBY4742MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0EUROSCARFY2454MATa mfa1Δ::MFA1pr-HIS3 can1Δ0 his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 lys2Δ049CMY503Y2454 sec14ts:natMX4This studyCMY505BY4741 sec14ts:natMX4This studyCMY506BY4742 sec14ts:natMX4This studyY01846BY4741 gyp1Δ::kanMX4EUROSCARFCMY514BY4741 gyp1Δ::kanMX4 sec14ts:natMX4This studyY06583BY4741 ypt31Δ::kanMX4EUROSCARFCMY515BY4741 ypt31Δ::kanMX4 sec14ts:natMX4This studyY02371BY4741 trs33Δ::kanMX4EUROSCARFCMY516BY4741 trs33Δ::kanMX4 sec14ts:natMX4This studyY01709BY4741 tlg2Δ::kanMX4EUROSCARFCMY517BY4741 tlg2Δ::kanMX4 sec14ts:natMX4This studyY05102BY4741 spo14Δ::kanMX4EUROSCARFCMY518BY4741 spo14Δ::kanMX4 sec14ts:natMX4This studyY06437BY4741 ric1Δ::kanMX4EUROSCARFCMY526BY4741 ric1Δ::kanMX4 sec14ts:natMX4This studyCMY553BY4741 rgp1Δ::LEU2This studyCMY554BY4741 rgp1Δ::LEU2 sec14ts:natMX4This studyY04462BY4741 vps45Δ::kanMX4EUROSCARFCMY527BY4741 vps45Δ::kanMX4 sec14ts:natMX4This studyY05171BY4741 ypt6Δ::kanMX4EUROSCARFCMY528BY4741 ypt6Δ::kanMX4 sec14ts:natMX4This studyY05091BY4741 vps51Δ::kanMX4EUROSCARFCMY530BY4741 vps51Δ::kanMX4 sec14ts:natMX4This studyY04318BY4741 vps52Δ::kanMX4EUROSCARFCMY531BY4741 vps52Δ::kanMX4 sec14ts:natMX4This studyFRY107BY4742 vps53Δ::kanMX450CMY532BY4742 vps53Δ::kanMX4 sec14ts:natMX4This studyY03966BY4742 vps54Δ::kanMX4EUROSCARFCMY533BY4741 vps54Δ::kanMX4 sec14ts:natMX4This studyY06772BY4741 sys1Δ::kanMX4EUROSCARFCMY547BY4741 sys1Δ::kanMX4 sec14ts:natMX4This studyY03304BY4741 arl1Δ::kanMX4EUROSCARFCMY548BY4741 arl1Δ::kanMX4 sec14ts:natMX4This studyY02777BY4741 arl3Δ::kanMX4EUROSCARFCMY549BY4741 arl3Δ::kanMX4 sec14ts:natMX4This studyY04576BY4741 ypt32Δ::kanMX4EUROSCARFCMY550BY4741 ypt32Δ::kanMX4 sec14ts:natMX4This studyY04796BY4741 trs65Δ::kanMX4EUROSCARFCMY551BY4741 trs65Δ::kanMX4 sec14ts:natMX4This studyY04738BY4741 trs85Δ::kanMX4EUROSCARFCMY552BY4741 trs85Δ::kanMX4 sec14ts:natMX4This studyCMY566MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 (S288C) RFP-SNF7UCSFCMY557MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 (S288C) RFP-CHC1UCSFCMY559MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 (S288C) RFP-ANP1UCSFCMY563MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 (S288C) RFP-SEC13UCSFCMY562MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 (S288C) RFP-COP1UCSFCMY564MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 (S288C) RFP-ERG6UCSFCMY537MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 (S288C) RFP-SNF7 sec14ts:natMX4This studyCMY535MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 (S288C) RFP-CHC1 sec14ts:natMX4This studyCMY534MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 (S288C) RFP-ANP1 sec14ts:natMX4This studyCMY536MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 (S288C) RFP-SEC13 sec14ts:natMX4This studyCMY538MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 (S288C) RFP-COP1 sec14ts:natMX4This studyCMY539MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 (S288C) RFP-ERG6 sec14ts:natMX4This studyX2180-1AMATa mal mel gal2 CUP1 SUC2Randy SheckmanSF292-1AMATa sec14-3 (sec14ts) isogenic to X2180-1ARandy SheckmanSF282-1DMATa sec18-1 (sec18ts) isogenic to X2180-1ARandy SheckmanCBY926MATα ura3-52 his3Δ200 lys2-801 leu2-3,112 trp1Δ901 suc2Δ9 osh1Δ::kanMX4 osh2Δ::kanMX430osh3Δ::LYS2 osh4Δ::HIS3 osh5Δ::LEU2 osh6Δ::LEU2 osh7Δ::HIS3 [pCB255 (osh4-1 TRP1)] Open table in a new tab Monitoring Bulk Protein Secretion and Mass Spectrometry Identification of Secreted Proteins-Cells were grown to mid-log phase at 25 °C, and an equal cell number was shifted to 37 °C for 10 min and incubated with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 10 min and then with 10 mm unlabeled methionine/cysteine for 15 or 30 min. Proteins in the medium were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was exposed to x-ray film. Similarly, equal numbers of log phase cells were shifted to 37 °C for 1 h in fresh YPD medium and proteins precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Gelcode (Thermo Scientific). Proteins contained in gel slices were reduced with dithiothreitol, carboxamidomethylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin. Peptides were extracted with 70% acetonitrile, 1% formic acid. The extraction solvent was removed under vacuum, and the tryptic peptides were resuspended in 5% methanol, 0.5% formic acid. Liquid chromatography MS/MS was performed using an Ultimate pump and Famos auto-sampler (LC Packings, Amsterdam, Netherlands) interfaced to the nanoflow electrospray ionization source of a hybrid triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer (QTrap, Applied Biosystems). Samples were injected onto a capillary column (0.10 × 150 mm Chromolith C18, monolithic, Merck) at a flow rate of 1.2 μl per min. Solvent A consisted of 98% water, 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, and Solvent B consisted of 2% water, 98% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, and the linear gradient was as follows: 5% solvent B to 35% solvent B over 35 min then 90% B for 6 min before re-equilibration at 5% solvent B. The sample was sprayed through distal coated fused silica emitter tips, 75-μm inner diameter with 15-μm inner diameter tip (New Objectives PicoTip). The capillary voltage was 2.10 kV with a declustering potential of 60 V, and the curtain gas was set to 15 (arbitrary units). Spectra were acquired using the information-dependent acquisition mode. The two most intense ions from the survey scan (375-1200 m/z) were selected for tandem MS, and the collision energy was set based on the mass of the precursor as determined by the m/z and charge. The raw MS/MS data were searched against NCBI yeast entries and against all SwissProt entries using the MASCOT algorithm (Matrix Science). Search parameters were peptide mass and fragment mass tolerance 0.8 and 0.5 Da, respectively, with one missed cleavage allowed. Oxidized methionines and carboxamidomethylated cysteines were chosen as variable modifications. Invertase and Bgl2 Secretion Assays-The invertase secretion assay was performed as described (29Goldstein A. Lampen J.O.

Traffic. 2006; 7: 1224-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Mid-log phase cells were incubated at 25 °C or shifted to 37 °C for 15-60 min. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 mm NaN3, 10 mm KF solution, incubated on ice for 10 min, and then transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. Cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min, and pellets were resuspended in fresh pre-spheroplasting buffer (100 mm Tris-H2SO4, pH 9.4; 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol; 10 mm NaN3; 10 mm KF), incubated on ice for 15 min, centrifuged as before, washed with 0.5 ml of spheroplast buffer (50 mm KH2PO4-KOH, pH 7; 1.4 m sorbitol; 10 mm NaN3), and pelleted. Cells were resuspended in spheroplast buffer containing 167 μg/ml Zymolyase 100T and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Spheroplasts were then pelleted at 5,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were separated using a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and Bgl2 was detected by Western blot using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Bgl2. Bgl2 antibodies were the kind gifts of Randy Schekman (University of California, Berkeley) and Wei Guo (University of Pennsylvania). Ste3 Internalization-MATα cells were grown to mid-log phase at 25 °C and shifted to 37 °C for 2 h. Proteins were extracted, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with antibodies for Ste3 and Pgk1 (Molecular Probes). Ste3 antibodies were the kind gift of George Sprague (University of Oregon). Microscopy-Live cells were observed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope fitted with a plan-neofluor 100× oil immersion lens. Images were captured using a Zeiss Axio Cam HR using Axiovision 4.5 software. Cells were visualized using differential interference contrast (DIC), green fluorescent protein, or rhodamine filters as required. GFP-Snc1 subcloned into the plasmid pRS416 (pMJL1) was the kind gift of Hugh Pelham (MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK). The plasmid expressing the Vps27-GFP fusion was from Christopher Stefan (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). The yeast strains expressing red fluorescent protein-tagged organelle marker proteins were from Erin O’Shea (University of California, San Francisco). SGA Analysis of sec14ts Cells Uncovers Novel Genetic Interactions-S. cerevisiae contains 6607 genes of which ∼5000 are not essential. A haploid query strain containing a temperature-sensitive sec14ts allele was mated to ∼4800 viable single gene deletion haploid yeast strains of the opposite mating type using SGA technology (28Tong A.H. Lesage G. Bader G.D. Ding H. Xu H. Xin X. Young J. Berriz G.F. Brost R.L. Chang M. Chen Y. Cheng X. Chua G. Friesen H. Goldberg D.S. Haynes J. Humphries C. He G. Hussein S. Ke L. Krogan N. Li Z.

The resulting diploids were isolated and forced to undergo meiosis, and haploid cells were selected that contained the sec14ts allele in combination with each single gene deletion. The resulting strains, obtained from three separate screens, were incubated at permissive (25 °C) and semipermissive (35 °C) temperatures for growth of cells containing the sec14ts allele alone. We considered only strains with the sec14ts gene in combination with each single gene deletion able to grow at 25 °C, but not 35 °C, to eliminate genes unable to grow because of defective mating, sporulation, or restoration of vegetative growth from spores. Forty genes were isolated from the SGA screen whose inactivation aggravated growth of sec14ts-containing cells (Fig. 2A and Table 2). Inactivation of SPO14 (PC phospholipase D) had been previously determined to diminish growth of sec14ts cells (1Patton-Vogt J.L. Griac P. Sreenivas A. Bruno V. Dowd S. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol.

Of the 40 genes isolated, the largest group contained genes known to regulate Golgi-dependent vesicular transport processes consistent with Sec14 acting as an essential regulator of this process (Fig. 2A). As genetic interactions can be representative of direct regulation of a protein/process, or may indicate processes whose functions are linked but by several degrees of separation, we focused on the genes isolated from the SGA screen with known roles in vesicular transport.TABLE 2Yeast genes isolated from the synthetic genetic array screen whose inactivation aggravated growth of sec14ts cellsGeneOpen reading frameDescriptionCellular processSPO14YKR031CPhospholipase D, catalyzes hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid and cholineVesicular transport/phospholipid metabolismYPT31YER031CGTPase of Rab family involved in the endocytic and exocytic pathwaysVesicular transportTRS33YOR115CProtein of the TRAPPII complex involved in endocytic and exocytic pathways; GEF activity toward Ypt31Vesicular transportGYP1YOR070CGolgi GTPase-activating protein for Rab family membersVesicular transportTLG2YOL018Ct-SNARE involved in endocytosis and maintenance of resident proteins in the trans-GolgiVesicular transportUBP3YER151CUbiquitin-specific protease, interacts with Bre5Vesicular transportBRE5YNR051CRequired by Ubp3 to form an active de-ubiquitination complex which protects Sec23, a COPII subunit, from degradationVesicular transportKEX2YNL238WCalcium-dependent serine protease involved in the activation of proproteins of the secretory pathwayVesicular transport/Golgi functionVPS1YKR001CDynamin-like GTPase for vacuolar protein sorting and high density vesicle production for secretion of invertaseVesicular transportTCB2YNL087WSynaptotagmin like protein; contains 3 C2 domainsGolgi localizedINP51YIL002CPI-4,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatasePhospholipid metabolismYBR030WYBR030WProtein of unknown function.

https://openalex.org/W2025488709,"Cross-feeding is the exchange of nutrients among species of microbes. It has two potential evolutionary origins, one as an exchange of metabolic wastes or byproducts among species, the other as a form of cooperation known as reciprocal altruism. This paper explores the conditions favoring the origin of cooperative cross-feeding between two species. There is an extensive literature on the evolution of cooperation, and some of the requirements for the evolution of cooperative cross-feeding follow from this prior work–specifically the requirement that interactions be limited to small groups of individuals, such as colonies in a spatially structured environment. Evolution of cooperative cross-feeding by a species also requires that cross-feeding from the partner species already exists, so that the cooperating mutant will automatically be reciprocated for its actions. Beyond these considerations, some unintuitive dynamical constraints apply. In particular, the benefit of cooperative cross-feeding applies only in the range of intermediate cell densities. At low density, resource concentrations are too low to offset the cost of cooperation. At high density, resources shared by both species become limiting, and the two species become competitors. These considerations suggest that the evolution of cooperative cross-feeding in nature may be more challenging than for other types of cooperation. However, the principles identified here may enable the experimental evolution of cross-feeding, as born out by a recent study."
https://openalex.org/W2088677753,"Blood coagulation involves a series of enzymatic protein complexes that assemble on the surface of anionic phospholipid. To investigate whether apolipoproteins affect coagulation reactions, they were included during the preparation of anionic phospholipid vesicles using a detergent solubilization-dialysis method. Apolipoprotein components of high density lipoproteins, especially apolipoprotein A-I, had a pronounced anticoagulant effect. The anionic phospholipids lost their procoagulant effect when the vesicle preparation method was performed in the presence of apolipoprotein A-I. The anionic phospholipid-apolipoprotein A-I particles were 8-10 nm in diameter and contained around 60-80 phospholipid molecules, depending on the phospholipid composition. The phospholipids of these particles were unable to support the activation of prothrombin by factor Xa in the presence of factor Va and unable to support binding of factor Va, whereas binding of prothrombin and factor Xa were efficient. Phospholipid transfer protein was shown to mediate transfer of phospholipids from liposomes to apolipoprotein A-I-containing reconstituted high density lipoprotein. In addition, serum was also shown to neutralize the procoagulant effect of anionic liposomes and to efficiently mediate transfer of phospholipids from liposomes to either apolipoprotein A-I- or apolipoprotein B-containing particles. In conclusion, apolipoprotein A-I was found to neutralize the procoagulant properties of anionic phospholipids by arranging the phospholipids in surface areas that are too small to accommodate the prothrombinase complex. This anionic phospholipid scavenger function may be an important mechanism to control the exposure of such phospholipids to circulating blood and thereby prevent inappropriate stimulation of blood coagulation.

The atheroprotective functions of HDL are thought to be related to the ability of HDL to take up cholesterol from peripheral organs and to mediate the transport of excess cholesterol to the liver for excretion (4Curtiss L.K. Valenta D.T. Hime N.J. Rye K.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 5Vedhachalam C. Duong P.T. Nickel M. Nguyen D. Dhanasekaran P. Saito H.

In addition, recent studies reveal that HDL has various other favorable anti-atherogenic effects (6Florentin M. Liberopoulos E.N. Wierzbicki A.S. Mikhailidis D.P. Curr. Opin. Cardiol. 2008; 23: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is the major protein in HDL, constituting about 70% of the protein content of HDL particles. ApoA-I is synthesized in the liver and intestine as pre-pro-apoA-I. After processing, the pre- and pro-peptides are cleaved, and apoA-I is incorporated into plasma HDL particles (7Gordon J.I. Sims H.F. Lentz S.R. Edelstein C. Scanu A.M. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4037-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoA-I can exist in three different forms in plasma, either in a lipid-free/lipid-poor form or as a component of discoidal or spherical HDL (8Rye K.A. Barter P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Discoidal HDL usually contains two or three molecules of apoA-I and phospholipids with or without unesterified cholesterol (4Curtiss L.K. Valenta D.T. Hime N.J. Rye K.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 8Rye K.A. Barter P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Reconstituted HDL (rHDL) particles can be generated from isolated apoA-I and phospholipids and have been extensively used for in vitro and in vivo studies of discoidal HDL (9Jonas A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 553-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque triggers primary hemostasis events, which involve a cascade of proteolytic reactions resulting in the formation of thrombin and subsequent fibrinogen to fibrin clot conversion. The reactions occur on membrane surfaces containing the anionic phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS), which is exposed on the surface of activated platelets. The coagulation proteins bind to the phospholipid surface and assemble into multi-molecular enzyme complexes, e.g. the tenase and prothrombinase complexes (10Butenas S. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 67: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 11Dahlback B. J. Int. Med. 2005; 257: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the tenase complex, the enzyme factor IXa (FIXa) together with its cofactor factor VIIIa (FVIIIa) activate factor X (FX) to factor Xa (FXa) (12Fay P.J. Blood Rev. 2004; 18: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The prothrombinase complex (see Fig. 5A in discussion for a schematic picture) consists of the enzyme FXa, which with support from its cofactor factor Va (FVa) activates prothrombin (13Krishnaswamy S. Nesheim M.E. Pryzdial E.L. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 260-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).

Plasma lipoproteins have been suggested to influence the reactions of blood coagulation. Thus, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) is reported to stimulate the activations of FVII and prothrombin (20Moyer M.P. Tracy R.P. Tracy P.B. van't Veer C. Sparks C.E. Mann K.G. Arterioscler.

Med. 1999; 9: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, HDL was reported to function as a cofactor for the anticoagulant protein C pathway (2Griffin J.H. Kojima K. Banka C.L. Curtiss L.K. Fernandez J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In support for an anticoagulant effect of HDL, low plasma concentration of HDL was identified as a risk factor of venous thrombosis (23Deguchi H. Pecheniuk N.M. Elias D.J. Averell P.M. Griffin J.H. Circulation. 2005; 112: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The aim of the study was to elucidate mechanisms that regulate the reaction of blood coagulation on the phospholipid surface of lipoprotein particles from human blood and to determine whether apolipoproteins affect blood coagulation reactions. Isolated apolipoproteins were used together with anionic phospholipids to generate reconstituted lipoproteins. Here we demonstrate that apoA-I has the ability to neutralize the procoagulant properties of anionic phospholipid during the generation of rHDL. The anticoagulant properties of apoA-I may be an important component of the anti-atherogenic and anti-thrombotic potential of HDL. Isolation of Lipoprotein Fractions—Lipidmic plasma obtained from the local blood bank was thawed overnight at 4 °C. EDTA was added to a final concentration of 0.04%. Lipoproteins were isolated from plasma by sequential flotation ultracentrifugation as previously described using a Beckman centrifuge (Optima L-70K) (24Schumaker V.N. Puppione D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). All of the isolated fractions were dialyzed into HN buffer (10 mm Hepes with 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and stored at -20 °C. Proteins from isolated lipoprotein fractions were extracted with, at least 20-fold excess, ether/ethanol 33/67 (v/v) at room temperature overnight with continuous stirring. Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 6 m guanidine HCl to the original volume of each lipoprotein fraction. Purification of ApoA-I from HDL—Extracted proteins from the HDL fraction were separated on two serially coupled S-200 Hiprep 26/60 size exclusion columns (GE Healthcare) using 6 m guanidine HCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. ApoA-I was further purified on a Q Sepharose Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 6 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Bound proteins were eluted by a 0-300 mm linear gradient of NaCl. Fractions containing apoA-I were pooled and stored at -20 °C. Protein concentration was determined at absorbance 280 nm with a calculated extinction coefficient of 1.155 g-1·liter·cm-1 (25Grimsley G.R. Pace C.N. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2003: 3.1.1-3.1.9Google Scholar). Phospholipid Vesicle Preparation—Natural phospholipids (PL), phosphatidylserine (PS, brain extract), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE, egg extract), and phosphatidylcholine (PC, egg extract) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and dissolved in 10/90 (v/v) methanol/chloroform solution. The lipids were mixed, dried under N2 gas, and resuspended in HN buffer at room temperature. A trace amount of 14C-radiolabeled PC (GE Healthcare) was added to the lipid mixture when necessary. The lipids were then solubilized by adding n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Calbiochem) to a final concentration of 200 mm. Solubilized lipids and apoA-I were mixed 50/50 (v/v) and dialyzed against at least 1000-fold excess of TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) or HN buffer at room temperature using 12-14,000 molecular weight cut-off membranes (Spectra/Por). During the generation of liposomes, the solubilized lipids were dialyzed as mentioned above. Characterization of rHDL with ApoA-I—Generated rHDL particles, with apoA-I, were isolated on Superose 6 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) having HN buffer as running buffer. The column was connected to an ÄKTA fast performance liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) and calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions using thyroglobulin, ferritin, aldolase, ovalbumin, and ribonuclease (GE Healthcare). rHDL particles were characterized for phospholipid composition by scintillation counting (Liquid scintillation counter, Wallac 1410; Pharmacia) and for protein composition by the apoA-I enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (see below). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay for ApoA-I—ApoA-I was detected in rHDL particles using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Wells (96-well plates, MaxiSorp; Nunc) were coated with 10 μg/ml of rabbit anti-apoA-I polyclonal antibody (Dako, Denmark) overnight at 4 °C. The plates were blocked with 3% fish gelatin (Norland Products) for 2 h at room temperature. The apoA-I standard (plasma purified apoA-I dialyzed against TBS at 4 °C using 3500 molecular weight cut-off membranes (Spectra/Por)) and samples to be tested were diluted in TBS, pH 7.4, with 1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) and placed in the plates for 2 h at room temperature. The plates were washed three times in TBS, pH 7.4, with 0.1% Triton X-100. Biotinylated mouse anti-apoA-I monoclonal antibody (in house made monoclonal antibody raised against apoA-I, using standard procedures (26Yokoyama W.M. Christensen M. Dos Santos G. Miller D. Coligan J.E. Bierer B.E. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2006: 2.5.1-2.5.25Google Scholar)) was then diluted to 1 μg/ml in TBS, pH 7.4, 1% BSA, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and added on plates for 1 h at room temperature followed by wash. Streptavidin-avidin complex with horseradish peroxidase (Dako, Denmark) was prepared according to manufacturer's instructions and diluted in TBS, pH 7.4, with 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100, and added to the plates. The plates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and after washing developed with peroxide and o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Dako, Denmark). The reaction was terminated with 1 m H2SO4, and absorbance at 490 nm was measured with a microplate reader (EL808; BioTek Instruments) with Deltasoft 3 software. SDS/PAGE—The protein samples were loaded onto 15% Tricine-SDS/PAGE gels (27Gallagher S.R. Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K.M. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2007: 6.1.1-6.1.38Google Scholar) under nonreducing conditions. The gels were developed using a common silver staining procedure (28Dell'Angelica E.C. Bonifacino J.S.

Prothrombinase Assay—Phospholipid-containing samples in HNBSACa (HN with 5 mg/ml BSA and 5 mm CaCl2) were mixed with factor V (FV, purified from plasma as described (29Dahlback B. J. Clin. Investig. 1980; 66: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (30Tans G. Rosing J. Thomassen M.C. Heeb M.J. Zwaal R.F. Griffin J.H. Blood. 1991; 77: 2641-2648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and FXa (Kordia, Leiden, The Netherlands) to concentrations of 420 pm and 5 nm, respectively. FV was activated by the addition of thrombin (Hematologic Technologies, Inc, Essex Junction, VT) to final concentration 3 units/liter for 3 min at 37 °C, and the activation was terminated by addition of hirudin (Pentapharm, Basel, Switzerland) to final concentration 8 units/liter. The samples (60 μl) were transferred to a 96-well plate (Sero-well, Sterilin) and mixed with 40 μl of HNBSACa. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 μl prothrombin (Kordia, Leiden, The Netherlands) to final concentration 0.5 μm and incubated at 37 °C for 2 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of EDTA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm EDTA, 1% polyethylene glycol 6000, pH 7.9). The samples were further diluted 1:75 in 100 mm EDTA buffer before detection of generated thrombin. Aliquots of 150 μl were mixed with 50 μl of a synthetic substrate, S-2238 (kindly provided by Chromogenix, Milan, Italy; final concentration 0.5 mm), and absorbance at 405 nm was measured continuously for 15 min with a microplate reader. The final concentrations of proteins during the activation of prothrombin were; FVa 210 pm, FXa 2.5 nm, and prothrombin 0.5 μm. During the 2-min activation time, using a phospholipid concentration of ≤5 μm, the thrombin generation was within the linear range. The amount of thrombin generated in the assay was calculated using a standard curve generated from a thrombin titration (150 μl of thrombin dilution and 50 μl of S-2238) with known amounts of protein. Prothrombinase Activation without FVa—The assay was done as described for prothrombinase assay, with the following changes. FXa was used at 20 times higher concentration (final concentration, 50 nm), and FV, thrombin, and hirudin were replaced with HNBSACa. The reaction with prothrombin was prolonged to 5 min at 37 °C and stopped as described. The samples were then diluted only 1:15 in 100 mm EDTA buffer before detection of generated thrombin. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Human plasma derived prothrombin and FXa were both purchased from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Recombinant annexin V was from BD Biosciences Pharmingen (San Jose, CA). Human FVa was purified from plasma as described (31Rosing J. Bakker H.M. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. Tans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21130-21136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prethrombin-1 was prepared essentially as described previously (32Dahlback B. Stenflo J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 104: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, prothrombin (2.0 mg/ml) was incubated with 10 units/ml thrombin for 2 h at 37 °C. Prethrombin-1 was isolated by chromatography on a column with DEAE-Sephadex A-50 in 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0-0.3 m, 600 ml of each vessel). To check the purity of the prethrombin-1, the fractions were run under reducing conditions on SDS acryl amide gel and stained with silver stain. Prethrombin-1 pool activity was measured with thrombin substrate (S-2238) after activation with snake venom Echis carinatus (from Sigma-Aldrich). Prothrombin, FVa, and FXa binding to isolated rHDL particles of different phospholipid composition was quantified by surface plasmon resonance using a Biacore 2000 instrument (Uppsala, Sweden) at 24 °C. Annexin V was used as an additional positive membrane binding control, whereas prethrombin-1, a Gla-less derivative of prothrombin known not to interact with membranes was used as a negative control. LI sensor chip was washed with 40 mm octyl glucoside (1 min at 20 μl/min) immediately followed by an injection of rHDL (10-20 μm phospholipid) for 17 min at a 3 μl/min flow rate in HN running buffer. Binding responses proceeded to saturation and for typical immobilizations were between 680 and 1460 RU. Weakly adhering rHDL were removed with five consecutive 10 mm EDTA pH 8.0 injections (2 min at 20 μl/min). For protein binding experiments running buffer was changed to HNBSACa (HN with 10 mg/ml BSA and 5 mm CaCl2), and flow cells were equilibrated until the base line stabilized to less than 0.05 RU/min. Equilibrium response data were collected for each protein at several concentrations typically spanning 10-fold above and below the Kd of the interaction. A control flow cell containing rHDL with 100% PC was used to subtract RUs because of the refractive index of the protein solution and any instrument noise. No binding was detected in the control flow cell for any of the proteins tested. The immobilized rHDL surface could be regenerated by removing membrane-bound protein with an injection of 10 mm EDTA pH 8.0 (for prothrombin, FXa, and annexin V) or 50 mm NaOH pH 11.5 (for FVa), which returned the base line to the value prior to introducing protein. Equilibrium data (Req) was fitted to a one-site binding hyperbola according to the relationship Req = Bmax·C/(Kd + C), where Bmax is the binding at saturation, C corresponds to the injected analyte concentration, and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant. An excess concentration of Ca2+ (5 mm) was included to avoid limiting membrane affinity (33Nelsestuen G.L. Lim T.K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4164-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and BSA (0.1%) was included to block any nonspecific protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions (34Stone M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4037-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The experiments were carried out with replicate analyte concentrations. Liposome Uptake to rHDL—Equal volumes of apoA-I-containing rHDL particles with 30:1 PL/apoA-I molar ratio (10: 40:50 PS/PE/PC, 800 μm PL) and 100 μm 14C-PC-labeled liposomes (10:40:50 PS/PE/PC) were mixed. The samples were then incubated in the presence or absence of purified human phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) (35Vikstedt R. Metso J. Hakala J. Olkkonen V.M. Ehnholm C. Jauhiainen M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 11979-11986Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (final PL transfer activity, 1000 nmol/ml/h) at 37 °C for 24 h. As a control, 50 μm 14C-PC-labeled liposomes (10:40:50 PS/PE/PC) were incubated with PLTP as above. The samples were then separated on Superose 6 10/300 GL using TBS as running buffer. The eluted fractions were analyzed for radioactivity by scintillation counting. Liposome Phospholipid Uptake by Lipoproteins in Human Serum—Equal volumes of human serum (from healthy volunteer) and 50 μm 14C-PC labeled liposomes (10:40:50 PS/PE/PC) were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The samples were then separated on Superose 6 10/300 GL using TBS as running buffer. Eluted fractions were analyzed for radioactivity by scintillation counting. As a control, equal volumes of 40 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 μm 14C-PC labeled liposomes (10:40:50 PS/PE/PC) were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Before the addition to the gel filtration column, the samples were also used as source of phospholipid in a prothrombinase assay to test for procoagulant phospholipid activity (as described above). Lipoproteins Are Unable to Support Prothrombinase Reaction—Isolated chylomicrons/VLDL, LDL, HDL, and VHDL were tested for their ability to support prothrombinase activity. The enzyme FXa and its cofactor FVa were incubated with intact lipoprotein particles or with liposomes generated from anionic phospholipids. Prothrombin was added, and the generation of thrombin was determined. None of the intact lipoproteins were able to stimulate prothrombin activation (data not shown). A small stimulatory activity was observed in the isolated HDL preparation but was found not to be associated with the HDL particle when the HDL was further purified by gel filtration chromatography, and fractions were tested in the prothrombinase assay. The stimulatory activity eluted in the void of the column and not in fractions containing the HDL particles. Thus, it was concluded that none of the isolated lipoproteins were able to support the activation of prothrombin by the FXa-FVa complex. Anionic Phospholipids Lose Procoagulant Properties when Incorporated into Reconstituted HDL—The extracted apolipoproteins were then used together with anionic phospholipids to generate reconstituted lipoproteins. These lipoproteins were tested in the prothrombinase reaction to elucidate whether the anionic phospholipids retained their ability to support the prothrombin activation when incorporated into lipoproteins. The extracted protein components from HDL and VHDL completely inhibited the ability of the anionic phospholipids to support prothrombin activation, whereas protein extracts from VLDL and LDL had no such effect (Fig. 1A). To identify which protein was responsible for the inhibiting effect, the extracted HDL proteins were fractionated on gel filtration chromatography in the presence of 6 m guanidine HCl. The proteins were then used together with anionic phospholipids to reconstitute lipoproteins that were tested in the prothrombinase reaction. The inhibitory activity was found to be associated with an ∼25-kDa protein (Fig. 1B), which after further purification on Q Sepharose was identified as apoA-I. To further investigate the anticoagulant effects of apoA-I, rHDL was generated from purified apoA-I and natural phospholipids (10:40:50 PS/PE/PC), using a molar PL/apoA-I ratio of 260:1, and the rHDL was isolated on a Superose 6 column. The isolated rHDL particles had a Stokes diameter of 8 nm and the molar PL/apoA-I ratio was determined to be around 38:1 (Table 1). The isolated rHDL are discoidal, and cross-linking experiments suggested that each disc contained two apoA-I molecules (see supplemental Fig. 1), and thus, 38 phospholipids were contained per leaflet of the membrane bilayer. The isolated rHDL did not stimulate prothrombin activation to the same extent as control liposomes (10% PS), which were highly efficient in supporting prothrombin activation (Fig. 2A). When FXa was used without its cofactor FVa, the rHDL did support activation of prothrombin, similar to control liposomes (Fig. 2B). The isolated rHDL preparations were also tested in a tenase reaction with FIXa and FVIIIa but also in this case, the rHDL did not stimulate the reaction, in contrast to control liposomes that were highly efficient (data not shown).TABLE 1Properties and composition of rHDL of various PL composition (PS/PE/PC)PS/PE/PC10/40/5050/0/5075/0/250/0/100apoA-I (μm)aBy apoA-I enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.0.4 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.070.6 ± 0.060.3 ± 0.07Phospholipid (μm)bBy scintillation counting of [14C]PC.14.5 ± 2.219.7 ± 3.320.0 ± 2.018.2 ± 1.7PL/apoA-I38.1 ± 12.739.2 ± 8.831.6 ± 3.763.0 ± 8.3Stokes diameter (nm)cBy size exclusion chromatography.8.2 ± 0.49.5 ± 0.010.1 ± 0.57.9 ± 0.0a By apoA-I enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.b By scintillation counting of [14C]PC.c By size exclusion chromatography. Open table in a new tab rHDL particles with higher PS content (75:0:25 and 50:0:50 PS/PE/PC) were also tested. The isolated rHDL particles had the same PL/apoA-I molar ratios and slightly larger Stokes diameter than the rHDL particles with 10% PS (Table 1). However, despite their higher PS content, the rHDL particles did not support prothrombin activation in the presence of FVa to the same extent as control liposomes (10:40:50 PS/PE/PC) (Fig. 2A). In the absence of FVa, the rHDL particles were capable of prothrombin activation, to a similar extent as control liposomes (Fig. 2B)"
https://openalex.org/W2039734247,"Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is an important effector of innate immunity. We have previously shown that SP-D accumulates at sites of acute bacterial infection and neutrophil infiltration, a setting associated with the release of reactive species such as peroxynitrite. Incubation of native SP-D or trimeric SP-D lectin domains (NCRDs) with peroxynitrite resulted in nitration and nondisulfide cross-linking. Modifications were blocked by peroxynitrite scavengers or pH inactivation of peroxynitrite, and mass spectroscopy confirmed nitration of conserved tyrosine residues within the C-terminal neck and lectin domains. Mutant NCRDs lacking one or more of the tyrosines allowed us to demonstrate preferential nitration of Tyr314 and the formation of Tyr228-dependent cross-links. Although there was no effect of peroxynitrite or tyrosine mutations on lectin activity, incubation of SP-D dodecamers or murine lavage with peroxynitrite decreased the SP-D-dependent aggregation of lipopolysaccharide-coated beads, supporting our hypothesis that defective aggregation results from abnormal cross-linking. We also observed nitration, cross-linking of SP-D, and a significant decrease in SP-D-dependent aggregating activity in the lavage of mice acutely exposed to nitrogen dioxide. Thus, modification of SP-D by reactive oxygen-nitrogen species could contribute to alterations in the structure and function of SP-D at sites of inflammation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2091002369,"Allelic specific gene expression (ASGE) appears to be an important factor in human phenotypic variability and as a consequence, for the development of complex traits and diseases. In order to study ASGE across the human genome, we have performed a study in which genotyping was coupled with an analysis of ASGE by screening 11,500 SNPs using the Mapping 10 K Array to identify differential allelic expression. We found that from the 5,133 SNPs that were suitable for analysis (heterozygous in our sample and expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells), 2,934 (57%) SNPs had differential allelic expression. Such SNPs were equally distributed along human chromosomes and biological processes. We validated the presence or absence of ASGE in 18 out 20 SNPs (90%) randomly selected by real time PCR in 48 human subjects. In addition, we observed that SNPs close to -but not included in- segmental duplications had increased levels of ASGE. Finally, we found that transcripts of unknown function or non-coding RNAs, also display ASGE: from a total of 2,308 intronic SNPs, 1510 (65%) SNPs underwent differential allelic expression. In summary, ASGE is a widespread mechanism in the human genome whose regulation seems to be far more complex than expected."
https://openalex.org/W1964869974,"Background The correlations between Phanerozoic atmospheric oxygen fluctuations and insect body size suggest that higher oxygen levels facilitate the evolution of larger size in insects. Methods and Principal Findings Testing this hypothesis we selected Drosophila melanogaster for large size in three oxygen atmospheric partial pressures (aPO2). Fly body sizes increased by 15% during 11 generations of size selection in 21 and 40 kPa aPO2. However, in 10 kPa aPO2, sizes were strongly reduced. Beginning at the 12th generation, flies were returned to normoxia. All flies had similar, enlarged sizes relative to the starting populations, demonstrating that selection for large size had functionally equivalent genetic effects on size that were independent of aPO2. Significance Hypoxia provided a physical constraint on body size even in a tiny insect strongly selected for larger mass, supporting the hypothesis that Triassic hypoxia may have contributed to a reduction in insect size."
https://openalex.org/W2055951748,"Alkalosis impairs the natriuretic response to diuretics, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. The soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) is a chemosensor that mediates bicarbonate-dependent elevation of cAMP in intracellular microdomains. We hypothesized that sAC may be an important regulator of Na(+) transport in the kidney. Confocal images of rat kidney revealed specific immunolocalization of sAC in collecting duct cells, and immunoblots confirmed sAC expression in mouse cortical collecting duct (mpkCCD(c14)) cells. These cells exhibit aldosterone-stimulated transepithelial Na(+) currents that depend on both the apical epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) and basolateral Na(+),K(+)-ATPase. RNA interference-mediated 60-70% knockdown of sAC expression comparably inhibited basal transepithelial short circuit currents (I(sc)) in mpkCCD(c14) cells. Moreover, the sAC inhibitors KH7 and 2-hydroxyestradiol reduced I(sc) in these cells by 50-60% within 30 min. 8-Bromoadenosine-3',5'-cyclic-monophosphate substantially rescued the KH7 inhibition of transepithelial Na(+) current. Aldosterone doubled ENaC-dependent I(sc) over 4 h, an effect that was abolished in the presence of KH7. The sAC contribution to I(sc) was unaffected with apical membrane nystatin-mediated permeabilization, whereas the sAC-dependent Na(+) current was fully inhibited by basolateral ouabain treatment, suggesting that the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, rather than ENaC, is the relevant transporter target of sAC. Indeed, neither overexpression of sAC nor treatment with KH7 modulated ENaC currents in Xenopus oocytes. ATPase and biotinylation assays in mpkCCD(c14) cells demonstrated that sAC inhibition decreases catalytic activity rather than surface expression of the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase. In summary, these results suggest that sAC regulates both basal and agonist-stimulated Na(+) reabsorption in the kidney collecting duct, acting to enhance Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2065713281,"Formation of receptor complexes between μ-opioid and α2A-adrenergic receptors has been demonstrated in transfected cells. The functional significance and underlying mechanisms of such receptor interactions remain to be determined in neuronal systems. We examined functional interactions between endogenous μ and α2A receptors in mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons. Acute application of the μ agonist [d-Ala2,N-MePhe4, Gly-ol5]enkephalin (DAMGO) or the α2 agonist clonidine inhibited voltage-gated Ca2+ currents in these neurons. Prolonged treatment with either DAMGO or clonidine induced a mutual cross-desensitization between μ and α2A receptor-mediated current inhibition. The cross-desensitization was closely associated with simultaneous internalization of μ and α2A receptors. Morphine, a μ agonist triggering little μ receptor endocytosis, induced neither cross-desensitization nor internalization of α2A receptors. Furthermore, inhibition of p38 MAPK prevented the cross-desensitization as well as cointernalization of μ and α2A receptors. Changes in receptor trafficking profiles suggested that p38 MAPK activity was required for initiating μ receptor internalization and maintaining possible μ-α2A association during their cointernalization. Finally, the μ-α2A cross-desensitization was absent in dorsal root ganglion neurons lacking β-arrestin 2. These findings demonstrated p38 MAPK- and β-arrestin 2-dependent cross-regulation between neuronal μ and α2A receptors. By promoting receptor cross-desensitization and cointernalization, such functional interactions may serve as negative feedback mechanisms triggered by prolonged agonist exposure to modulate the signaling of functionally related G protein-coupled receptors.

Changes in receptor trafficking profiles suggested that p38 MAPK activity was required for initiating μ receptor internalization and maintaining possible μ-α2A association during their cointernalization. Finally, the μ-α2A cross-desensitization was absent in dorsal root ganglion neurons lacking β-arrestin 2. These findings demonstrated p38 MAPK- and β-arrestin 2-dependent cross-regulation between neuronal μ and α2A receptors. By promoting receptor cross-desensitization and cointernalization, such functional interactions may serve as negative feedback mechanisms triggered by prolonged agonist exposure to modulate the signaling of functionally related G protein-coupled receptors. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; DRG, dorsal root ganglion; DAMGO, [d-Ala2,N-MePhe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin; Gβγ, G protein βγ subunits; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PPF, prepulse facilitation; β-arr2, β-arrestin 2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NE, norepinephrine; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; CTAP, Cys2, Tyr3, Arg5, Pen7-amide; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. interact with each other through formation of receptor complexes, including homo- or heterodimers and possibly higher order oligomers (1Bouvier M.

Heterooligomerization of GPCRs has been shown to enable cross-regulation between different receptor systems, resulting in various changes in receptor binding, signaling, and trafficking. For example, dimerization of μ-opioid and NK1 (neurokinin type 1) receptors in HEK-293 cells promotes agonist-induced cross-phosphorylation and cointernalization of the two receptors, whereas receptor binding and functional coupling are relatively unaffected (5Pfeiffer M. Kirscht S. Stumm R. Koch T. Wu D. Laugsch M. Schroder H. Hollt V. Schulz S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51630-51637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A similar pattern has been observed in cells expressing heterodimers of δ-opioid and β2-adrenergic receptors (6Jordan B.A. Trapaidze N. Gomes I. Nivarthi R. Devi L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 343-348PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of μ- and δ-opioid receptor complexes alters receptor properties, leading to synergistic enhancement of receptor binding and signaling by μ and δ ligands (7Gomes I. Jordan B.A. Gupta A. Trapaidze N. Nagy V. Devi L.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20 (1-5): RC110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The μ-δ heterodimer may form as early as in the endoplasmic reticulum during receptor processing and allows co-trafficking of the two receptors (8Hasbi A. Nguyen T. Fan T. Cheng R. Rashid A. Alijaniaram M. Rasenick M.M. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12997-13009Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Controversial evidence exists, however, for agonist-induced, separate endocytosis of μ and δ receptors (9Law P.Y. Erickson-Herbrandson L.J. Zha Q.Q. Solberg J. Chu J. Sarre A. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11152-11164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although these studies and many others have underscored the dynamic nature and divergent roles of receptor heterodimerization in GPCR modulation, the molecular basis and regulatory mechanisms for such interactions remain to be elucidated. In particular, most studies addressing this issue have been conducted in heterologous cells or in systems where receptors are overexpressed, which may lead to interactions nonexistent with endogenously expressed receptors. Further studies are necessary to identify and characterize interactions between naturally existing GPCRs in primary neurons. We examined interactions between endogenous μ-opioid and α2A-adrenergic receptors in mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Both μ and α2A receptors are coupled to Gi and Go proteins and induce similar cellular responses, such as inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and activation of inwardly rectifying potassium channels. These cellular effects can lead to presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmitter release or hyperpolarization of postsynaptic neurons. Both are crucial mechanisms for opioid and adrenergic modulation of nociception. A functional synergy between the two systems has been demonstrated in vivo, evidenced by potentiation of morphine analgesia (10Ossipov M.H. Harris S. Lloyd P. Messineo E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 1107-1116PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fairbanks C.A. Wilcox G.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 1107-1116PubMed Google Scholar) and alleviation of opiate withdrawal (12Maldonado R. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1997; 21: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) by the α2-adrenergic agonist clonidine. Studies in transgenic mice lacking functional α2A receptors further indicate that the α2A receptor is the principal subtype mediating α2 agonist-induced analgesia at the spinal level (13Lakhlani P.P. MacMillan L.B. Guo T.Z. McCool B.A. Lovinger D.M. Maze M. Limbird L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9950-9955Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and responsible for the synergistic potentiation of morphine analgesia (14Stone L.S. MacMillan L.B. Kitto K.F. Limbird L.E. Wilcox G.L. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7157-7165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exact mechanisms for this adrenergic-opioid synergy, however, remain unclear. Recently, the μ-α2A receptor heterodimers have been detected in HEK-293 cells co-expressing both receptors (15Jordan B.A. Gomes I. Rios C. Filipovska J. Devi L.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1317-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 16Zhang Y.Q. Limbird L.E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is of great interest to further explore whether heterodimerization of μ and α2A receptors serves as a novel mechanism coordinating the function of both receptors in pain-processing pathways. Here we report that endogenous μ and α2A receptors interact in DRG sensory neurons via p38 MAPK- and β-arrestin 2-dependent mechanisms, which promote agonist-selective cross-regulation of receptor signaling and internalization. DRG Cultures-Primary DRG cultures were prepared as described previously (17Tan M. Groszer M. Tan A.M. Pandya A. Liu X. Xie C.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10292-10301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the ganglia were collected from postnatal day 0–3 pups of C57 BL/6 mice, enzymatically dissociated for 30 min with minimal essential medium containing 0.25% trypsin at 37 °C, and triturated with fire-polished Pasteur pipettes. Dissociated neurons were plated onto glass coverslips coated with poly-l-ornithine and laminin. The cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2; fed with serum-free Neurobasal-A medium supplemented with B-27, l-glutamine, 2.5s nerve growth factor (0.1 μg/ml; Invitrogen), and 5-fluoxy-d-uridine (0.1 mg/ml; Sigma); and studied after 2–5 days in vitro. DRG cultures were also prepared using postnatal day 0–3 mice lacking α2A adrenergic receptors (α2A-/-) or β-arrestin 2 (β-arr2-/-) and their respective wild-type (+/+) controls. The α2A-/- (stock number 004367; Jackson Laboratory) (18Hein L. Limbird L.E. Eglen R.M. Kobilka B.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 881: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and β-arr2-/- lines (19Bohn L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Gainetdinov R.R. Peppel K. Caron M.G. Lin F.T. Science. 1999; 286: 2495-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar) have both been fully back-crossed to the C57 BL/6 background (10 generations). The +/+ mice used in the same experiments with the knockouts were within two generations of heterozygous mating. Electrophysiological Recordings-The voltage-gated Ca2+ currents were recorded from DRG neurons with 15–30-μm diameters under whole-cell voltage clamp conditions, as described (17Tan M. Groszer M. Tan A.M. Pandya A. Liu X. Xie C.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10292-10301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were perfused with an external solution containing 10 mm CaCl2, 130 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 mm HEPES, 25 mm d-glucose, and 0.25 μm tetrodotoxin at pH 7.35. The patch electrode was filled with an internal solution composed of 105 mm CsCl, 40 mm HEPES, 5 mm d-glucose, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm Mg-ATP, and 0.5 mm GTP at pH 7.2. Ca2+ currents were evoked every 10 s by 40-ms voltage steps from -80 to +10 mV using an Axopatch 200A patch clamp amplifier. Capacitance and series resistance were corrected with the compensation circuitry on the amplifier. Series resistance was compensated by 80–90%. Leak currents were subtracted using a P/6 protocol. Recorded signals were acquired and analyzed using Axon pCLAMP version 8.0 software (Axon Instruments). The amplitude of peak Ca2+ currents was determined using the peak detect feature of the software. Drug Application and Desensitization Protocols-The μ and α2 receptor ligands (Sigma) were prepared as stock solutions in water, diluted with external solution to the final concentration for acute bath application, or added into culture medium for pretreatment. Various kinase inhibitors (Sigma) were dissolved in DMSO and diluted with culture medium for pretreatment with a final DMSO concentration of 0.1%. Cells pretreated with the medium containing 0.1% DMSO served as vehicle controls in these experiments. In additional control experiments, DAMGO- or clonidine-induced current inhibition was compared between untreated cells and cells pretreated with 0.1% DMSO for 4 h. No significant differences were observed between the two treatments (data not shown). During recording, the external solution was continuously applied at 2 ml/min through a 0.5-ml recording chamber carrying the culture coverslip. After establishing a stable base line, the μ or α2 agonist was applied for up to 1 min to observe the maximal change in Ca2+ currents. Agonist-induced current inhibition was measured as the maximal reduction in the peak current amplitude during drug perfusion and expressed as percentage changes from the base-line level. The voltage dependence of agonist effect was assessed using a prepulse facilitation (PPF) protocol consisting of two normal test pulses (P1 and P2) and in between a strong depolarizing prepulse (-80 to +80 mV, 40 ms) delivered 10 ms before P2. The PPF was expressed by the amplitude ratio of currents activated by the two test pulses (P2/P1). To induce chronic desensitization, DRG cultures were pretreated with either μ or α2 agonist for 4 h. After extensive washing, whole-cell recording was performed in pretreated cells, and the acute inhibitory effect of μ or α2 agonist on Ca2+ currents was measured during a brief perfusion (0.5–1 min). The extent of desensitization was determined by the percentage reduction of the agonist effect in pretreated neurons relative to untreated neurons. Immunocytochemical Analysis and Fluorescence Confocal Microscopy-Cellular distribution of μ and α2A receptors in DRG cultures was determined by immunocytochemical double labeling. After drug treatment, the cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), permeabilized, and preblocked with PBS containing 10% normal donkey serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature. The cultures were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies against the C-terminal sequence of the μ receptor (20Keith D.E. Anton B. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Monteillet-Agius G. Stewart P.L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) or of the α2A receptor (21Nasser Y. Ho W. Sharkey K.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 2006; 495: 529-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (sc-1478 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); ab45871 (Abcam)). After washing, the cells were further incubated for 2 h with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG for visualization of μ receptors and with biotinylated anti-goat IgG (Calbiochem) and Cy3-conjugated streptavidin (Calbiochem) to detect α2A receptors. Control samples were prepared in the absence of the primary or secondary antibodies. The specificity of the anti-α2A antibody was further confirmed by the absence of α2A receptor labeling in neurons from the α2A-/- mice (see Fig. 4B). The images of neurons with receptor labeling were acquired using a Leica TCS-SP confocal laser-scanning microscope and processed either as a single scan or as maximum intensity projections of multiple scans taken at successive 1-μm depths. Flow Cytometric Measurement of Surface μ Receptors-Internalization of μ receptors was further accessed in living neurons by quantifying cell surface receptors with flow cytometry as described previously (22Walwyn W.M. Keith Jr., D.E. Wei W. Tan A.M. Xie C.W. Evans C.J. Kieffer B.L. Maidment N.T. Neuroscience. 2004; 123: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). DRG cultures were treated with clonidine, DAMGO, morphine, or control medium for 4 h at 37 °C. Monensin (10 μm) was added during the treatment to block recycling of internalized receptors in all experiments. DRG cells were then harvested in PBS containing 2 mm EDTA, spun at 300 × g for 5 min, and resuspended with PBS containing 1% normal goat serum and 0.1% NaN3. Cell surface μ receptors were labeled at 4 °C for 30 min with a polyclonal antibody against the third extracellular loop of the receptor (Chemicon International) (23Williams J.P. Thompson J.P. McDonald J. Barnes T.A. Cote T. Rowbotham D.J. Lambert D.G. Anesth. Analg. 2007; 105: 998-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and visualized with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG at 4 °C for another 30 min. Cell surface immunofluorescence was measured with a FACScan flow cytometer at 5,000–10,000 cells/sample. Data were acquired and analyzed using Cell Quest version 3.0.1 (BD Bioscience). The loss of cell surface μ receptors after agonist exposure was quantified by the reduction in the proportion of cells expressing detectable surface μ receptors (μ-positive cells) and in the density of surface receptors of μ-positive cells reflected by their mean fluorescence intensity. Nonspecific background fluorescence was determined in control samples processed without the primary antibody and was subtracted to obtain mean relative fluorescence intensity of experimental samples. Measurement of Phospho-p38 MAPK-The cellular level of phospho-p38 MAPK was measured with flow cytometry (24Perez O.D. Nolan G.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), using a polyclonal antibody recognizing p38 MAPK dually phosphorylated at Thr180 and Tyr182 (Cell Signaling Technology) (25Uddin S. Lekmine F. Sharma N. Majchrzak B. Mayer I. Young P.R. Bokoch G.M. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27634-27640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). After drug treatment, DRG cells were harvested from culture plates with PBS buffer containing 4 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm calyculin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Sigma) (26Kummer J.L. Rao P.K. Heidenreich K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20490-20494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized in ice-cold 90% methanol for 30 min, incubated with the primary antibody for 60 min at room temperature, and labeled with an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated second antibody for another 60 min. In between these steps, the cells were washed, centrifuged at 450 × g for 5 min, and resuspended with fresh PBS. After the final wash, the fluorescence signal of the cells was analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer at 5,000 cells/sample, and the data were processed with CellQuest software. Statistical Analysis-All data are presented as means ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance was applied for overall statistical significance across multiple group means, followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test for pairwise comparisons. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. α2-Adrenergic Agonist-induced Cross-desensitization to μ-Opioids-Brief bath application of norepinephrine (NE) at 10 μm induced acute inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+ currents in DRG neurons (Fig. 1A). This effect was significantly attenuated by a selective α2 antagonist yohimbine, confirming involvement of α2 receptors in NE action (27.2 ± 5.0% current inhibition without yohimbine versus 9.7 ± 1.6% with 10 μm yohimbine, n = 12 and 8, p < 0.05). Acute application of a selective α2 agonist, clonidine (10 μm), induced similar reductions in Ca2+ currents (20.0 ± 4.2%, n = 12) reversible by co-application of yohimbine (5.7 ± 1.6%, n = 10, p < 0.01 compared with clonidine alone). The effect of NE or clonidine was substantially reduced in neurons pretreated with the same agonist for 4 h (6.4 ± 1.7%, n = 9 for NE; 7.6 ± 1.1%, n = 8 for clonidine, p < 0.01 compared with the effects in untreated neurons), indicating development of homologous desensitization to α2 receptor-mediated effect. As expected, this desensitization was blocked by yohimbine added during NE or clonidine pretreatment (Fig. 1A). We then determined the influence of prolonged α2 agonist exposure on μ-opioid-induced Ca2+ current inhibition. In DRG neurons pretreated with 10 μm clonidine for 0.5 or 4 h, the subsequent DAMGO application (1 μm, 1 min) reduced Ca2+ currents by 40.5 ± 6.7% (n = 4) and 37.4 ± 3.0% (n = 18), respectively. The latter was significantly smaller than the responses in untreated cells (0 h, 54.7 ± 2.5%, n = 62, p < 0.01), indicative of a cross-desensitization to DAMGO. Similarly, morphine application (1 μm, 1 min) reduced Ca2+ currents by 47.6 ± 6.2% in control cells (0 h, n = 10) but by only 27.2 ± 4.4% in cells pretreated with clonidine for 4 h (n = 9, p < 0.05). Thus, prolonged NE or clonidine exposure heterologously reduced the effect of subsequently applied μ-opioid agonists. This cross-desensitization was prevented by yohimbine co-treatment (Fig. 1B). Inhibition of neuronal Ca2+ channels by GPCRs is mediated by both voltage-dependent and voltage-independent mechanisms. The voltage-dependent inhibition requires direct binding of G-protein βγ subunits (Gβγ) to the Ca2+ channel, a process reversible by strong depolarization. To determine whether this direct Gβγ-channel interaction was affected by clonidine, we examined voltage dependence of clonidine action using the PPF protocol (Fig. 1, C and D). In cells acutely perfused with clonidine (10 μm, 1 min), the depolarizing prepulse produced little relief of inhibition, with a P2/P1 ratio similar to that under basal conditions (1.06 ± 0.04 versus 0.99 ± 0.02, n = 5 for each group, p > 0.05). Clonidine pretreatment for 4 h was also without effect on the P2/P1 ratio subsequently tested either in control perfusion medium (0.97 ± 0.02, n = 8) or during acute clonidine test (1.06 ± 0.03, n = 8). These results suggested that at the concentration we used, the effect of clonidine was primarily mediated by voltage-independent mechanisms. We then measured PPF induced by intracellular application of 0.1 mm GTPγS that can directly activate G proteins and release Gβγ subunits. GTPγS-induced PPF was not significantly different between untreated control cells and clonidine-pretreated cells (1.68 ± 0.23 versus 1.68 ± 0.18 at 8 min after the application, n = 12 for each group, p > 0.05) (Fig. 1, C and D). This confirmed that clonidine-induced desensitization was not associated with a diminished cell capacity for voltage-dependent Gβγ-Ca2+ channel interactions. DAMGO-induced Cross-desensitization to α2A Adrenergic Responses-As we previously reported (17Tan M. Groszer M. Tan A.M. Pandya A. Liu X. Xie C.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10292-10301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Walwyn W.M. Keith Jr., D.E. Wei W. Tan A.M. Xie C.W. Evans C.J. Kieffer B.L. Maidment N.T. Neuroscience. 2004; 123: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), application of 1 μm DAMGO or morphine strongly inhibited Ca2+ currents in DRG neurons, but their effects were desensitized dramatically following a 4-h pretreatment (Fig. 2A). The inhibitory effect of 10 μm NE or clonidine on Ca2+ currents also significantly decreased in DAMGO-treated cells (11.4 ± 2.5%, n = 9 for NE; 5.3 ± 1.6%, n = 6 for clonidine, p < 0.05 for both as compared with untreated cells). This cross-desensitization was prevented by a selective μ receptor antagonist, Cys2, Tyr3, Arg5, Pen7-amide (CTAP), added during DAMGO pretreatment (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the effect of NE or clonidine was not significantly reduced in morphine-pretreated cells (21.7 ± 6.3%, n = 7 for NE; 16.3 ± 3.3%, n = 11 for clonidine, p > 0.05 for both as compared with untreated cells), despite development of homologous morphine desensitization in these cells (Fig. 2A). Thus, the cross-desensitization to clonidine was induced by prolonged treatment with DAMGO but not morphine. Since clonidine is relatively nonselective to different subtypes of the α2 receptors, we examined the role of α2A receptors in the acute and chronic effects of clonidine. Acute application of 10 μm clonidine induced negligible current inhibition in DRG neurons derived from the α2A-/- mice (2.5 ± 1.1%, n = 6, p > 0.05). In contrast to the wild-type neurons, the α2A-/- neurons also displayed no cross-desensitization to DAMGO following clonidine pretreatment (Fig. 4A). These results suggested that in our preparation, the α2A receptor was the major subtype responsible for clonidine-induced Ca2+ current inhibition and its cross-desensitization to DAMGO. Agonist-induced Cointernalization of μ and α2A Receptors- Next we determined whether the mutual cross-desensitization between μ and α2A receptors was associated with changes in agonist-induced receptor internalization. Immunohistochemical double labeling and confocal microscopy showed that a substantial portion of μ and α2A receptors were colocalized on the cell membrane throughout the cell body and processes of cultured DRG neurons under basal conditions (Fig. 3A). Incubation with DAMGO for 30 min to 4 h induced simultaneous internalization of both receptors, which was blocked by co-incubation with the μ antagonist CTAP (Fig. 3C). Clonidine also elicited internalization of both μ and α2A receptors, reversible by the α2 antagonist yohimbine (Fig. 3D). In contrast, morphine treatment up to 4 h failed to internalize either μ or α2A receptors (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, clonidine did not induce μ receptor endocytosis in α2A-/- neurons (Fig. 4B). Thus, similar to the cross-desensitization, the cointernalization was agonist-selective and dependent upon the presence of functional μ and α2A receptors. Fluorescence flow cytometry was then conducted in living DRG neurons to quantify agonist-induced μ receptor internalization. Surface μ receptors were detected in 77.7 ± 3% of control cells. DAMGO treatment for 4 h reduced the portion of cells expressing detectable levels of surface μ receptors (μ-positive cells) by 26.3 ± 5.8% (p < 0.05) relative to the controls (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the intensity of surface μ receptor labeling in the μ-positive cells decreased by 43.1 ± 7.8% (p < 0.05) following DAMGO treatment (Fig. 5A). These changes confirmed loss of surface μ receptors due to DAMGO-induced receptor internalization. Consistent with previous reports in heterologous cells (20Keith D.E. Anton B. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Monteillet-Agius G. Stewart P.L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 27Whistler J.L. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9914-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), morphine was much less effective in triggering μ receptor internalization, causing little change in surface μ receptor expression after a 4-h treatment. Importantly, clonidine pretreatment reduced the portion of μ-positive cells by 16.7 ± 5.7% and the level of surface μ receptors by 30.8 ± 10.9% (p < 0.05 for both compared with the controls), and both effects were blocked by yohimbine (Fig. 5). Blockade of μ-α2A Cross-desensitization and Cointernalization by p38 MAPK Inhibitors-To explore the signaling mechanisms underlying μ-α2A interactions, we examined potential involvement of several opioid-activated protein kinases in the cross-desensitization. DRG neurons were pretreated with clonidine (10 μm, 4 h) in the presence of a selective kinase inhibitor, washed, and tested for acute DAMGO responses. As shown in Fig. 6A, co-treatment with a selective p38 MAPK inhibitor PD169316 (26Kummer J.L. Rao P.K. Heidenreich K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20490-20494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) attenuated clonidine-induced cross desensitization. Acute DAMGO responses were significantly greater in cells co-treated with 5 or 20 μm PD169316 (49.0 ± 4.8% (n = 8) or 54.9 ± 8.1% (n = 10)) compared with cells treated with clonidine alone (37.4 ± 3.0%, n = 18, p < 0.05 for both comparisons). Another selective p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB239063 (28Underwood D.C. Osborn R.R. Bochnowicz S. Webb E.F. Rieman D.J. Lee J.C. Romanic A.M. Adams J.L. Hay D.W. Griswold D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L895-L902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also significantly reduced the cross-desensitization when co-applied with clonidine. In contrast, inhibitors of several other protein kinases failed to prevent clonidine-induced cross-desensitization, which included the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (10 μm), the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor PD98059 (10 μm), the protein kinase A inhibitor rpCAMP (1 mm), and the protein kinase C inhibitor Go6987 (0.1 μm). Acute DAMGO responses in cells co-treated with these inhibitors was 41.7 ± 2.7% (n = 14), 38.5 ± 6.3% (n = 7), 31.5 ± 4.5% (n = 7), and 36.8 ± 6.6% (n = 6), respectively, not significantly different from that in cells treated with clonidine alone. In a separate set of experiments, DRG neurons were pretreated with DAMGO (1 μm, 4 h) in the presence of one of the kinase inhibitors and tested for acute responses to clonidine. Blocking p38 MAPK activity with PD169316 (5 and 20 μm) during pretreatment attenuated DAMGO-induced cross-desensitization in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). The responses to subsequent clonidine test were significantly greater in cells co-treated with 20 μm PD169316 compared with those treated with DAMGO alone (13.9 ± 2.4% versus 5.7 ± 0.8%, n = 17 and 18, p < 0.01). Co-treatment with another specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 (20 μm) (29Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F."

Potential adverse effects associated with long-term daily minocycline therapy in human patients are concerning. Here, we investigated whether less frequent treatment with long-circulating polyethylene glycol (PEG) minocycline liposomes are effective in treating EAE.Performing in vitro time kinetic studies of PEG minocycline-liposomes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we determined that PEG minocycline-liposome preparations stabilized with CaCl(2) are effective in diminishing MMP-9 activity. Intravenous injections of PEG minocycline-liposomes every five days were as effective in ameliorating clinical EAE as daily intraperitoneal injections of minocycline. Treatment of animals with PEG minocycline-liposomes significantly reduced the number of CNS-infiltrating leukocytes, and the overall expression of MMP-9 in the CNS. There was also a significant suppression of MMP-9 expression and proteolytic activity in splenocytes of treated animals, but not in CNS-infiltrating leukocytes. Thus, leukocytes gaining access to the brain and spinal cord require the same absolute amount of MMP-9 in all treatment groups, but minocycline decreases the absolute cell number.Our data indicate that less frequent injections of PEG minocycline-liposomes are an effective alternative pharmacotherapy to daily minocycline injections for the treatment of CNS autoimmune diseases. Also, inhibition of MMP-9 remains a promising treatment target in EAE and patients with MS."

Mutations within intracellular C-terminal sequences of specific channels underlie a diverse set of channelopathies, including cardiac arrhythmias and epilepsy syndromes. The three-dimensional structure of the C-terminal residues 1777-1882 of the human NaV1.2 voltage-gated sodium channel has been determined in solution by NMR spectroscopy at pH 7.4 and 290.5 K. The ordered structure extends from residues Leu-1790 to Glu-1868 and is composed of four alpha-helices separated by two short anti-parallel beta-strands; a less well defined helical region extends from residue Ser-1869 to Arg-1882, and a disordered N-terminal region encompasses residues 1777-1789. Although the structure has the overall architecture of a paired EF-hand domain, the NaV1.2 C-terminal domain does not bind Ca2+ through the canonical EF-hand loops, as evidenced by monitoring 1H,15N chemical shifts during aCa2+ titration. Backbone chemical shift resonance assignments and Ca2+ titration also were performed for the NaV1.5 (1773-1878) isoform, demonstrating similar secondary structure architecture and the absence of Ca2+ binding by the EF-hand loops. Clinically significant mutations identified in the C-terminal region of NaV1 sodium channels cluster in the helix I-IV interface and the helix II-III interhelical segment or in helices III and IV of the NaV1.2 (1777-1882) structure."

In this study, several organelle-specific fluorescent markers and Ca2+-sensitive probes were used to identify the source of Ca2+ critical to PS externalization.

Despite tremendous progress in deciphering apoptotic pathways, however, the mechanism(s) responsible for the appearance of PS at the cell surface remains elusive (8Sahu S.K. Gummadi S.N. Manoi N.

Numerous studies have revealed the involvement of several lipid transporters in the regulation of transbilayer lipid distributions in eukaryotic cells (11Daleke D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 12Balasubramanian K. Schroit A.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 701-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The concerted action of an inward-directed aminophospholipid translocase and a less specific outward-directed floppase are considered to be responsible for maintaining the dynamic equilibrium distribution of phospholipids between the plasma membrane bilayer leaflets of quiescent cells (13Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Dekkers D.W.C. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Activation of a putative protein, coined phospholipid “scramblase,” dissipates normal membrane lipid asymmetry by facilitating the bidirectional transbilayer movement of all phospholipid classes irrespective of the composition of the polar head group of the lipid (14Williamson P. Kulick A. Zachowski A. Schlegel R.A. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6355-6390Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 15Smeets E.F. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Zwaal R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1195: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The most pronounced effect of perturbed lipid asymmetry is the appearance of PS in the external bilayer leaflet. Although the activation pathways for scramblase activity may differ between different cell types, a key upstream event seems to be a sustained elevation in intracellular [Ca2+] that occurs through its release from intracellular stores and by capacitive entry across the plasma membrane. The major stores of intracellular Ca2+ are the mitochondria (16Szalai G. Krishnamurthy R. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6349-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and ER (17Scorrano L.

Although the regulation of Ca2+ transients through these stores clearly represent critical check points in the regulation of apoptosis, the role of other intracellular Ca2+ stores in the externalization of PS has not been determined. In this study, we provide evidence that lysosomes respond to apoptotic stimuli by releasing their luminal Ca2+ to the cytosol. Our data indicate that Ca2+ released from these vesicles is critical to apoptosis-dependent expression of PS at the cell surface. Cells, Cell Lines, and Reagents-Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml uridine, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor. All of the fluorescent probes used for Ca2+ measurements and intracellular organelle identification were purchased from Invitrogen. The phospholipase A2 inhibitor, cPLA2α inhibitor (catalog number 525143), was purchased from Calbiochem. Apoptosis and Measurement of Apoptotic Markers-Cells (∼106/2.5 cm coverslip) were triggered into apoptosis by treatment with tumor necrosis factor α (50 ng/ml)/cyclohexamide (1 μg/ml) or staurosporine (STS, 0.5 μm) for the indicated times at 37 °C. Cells on coverslips or in suspension (106/ml) were analyzed for PS externalization by incubating the cells with FITC-labeled annexin V for 10 min at 20 °C in 0.5 ml of Tris-buffered saline containing CaCl2 (2 mm) and propidium iodide (1.0 μg/ml) followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. For DNA fragmentation (propidium iodide/cell cycle analysis), cells were fixed in 70% ethanol, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2), and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with RNase (1 μg/ml) followed by propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) prior to flow cytometry. Caspase 3 activity in 0.1% Triton X-100 cell lysates (4 × 106 cells) was determined fluorometrically using z-DEVD-AMC (0.5 μm) as described previously (3Balasubramanian K. Mirnikjoo B. Schroit A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18357-18364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Caspase activity was expressed as the rate of increase in fluorescent intensity (λex 380 nm, λem 510 nm) at 20 °C. Real-time Ca2+ Measurements-MEF (106) were incubated with 1 μm Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (19Roe M.W. Lemasters J.J. Herman B. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) (Fura-2AM; Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were then washed with Tris-buffered Hanks’ balanced salt solution and resuspended in the same buffer for fluorescence measurements. Cytosolic Ca2+ levels were measured in real time by assessing the ratio (R) of fluorescence intensities at 510 nm following excitation at 340 and 380 nm. To determine total cell Ca2+ (Rmax) and baseline levels (Rmin) of fluorescence, Nonidet P-40 (0.2%) and EGTA (2 mm) were added, respectively. Lysosomal Ca2+ was assessed by incubating cells with Rhod-2AM or Calcium Green-1 (CG1) (20Hallett M.B. Hodges R. Cadman M. Blanchfield H. Dewitt S. Pettit E.J. Laffafian I. Davies E.V. J. Immunol. Meth. 1999; 232: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (cell-impermeant hexapotassium salt; 1 μm for 1 h at 37 °C) followed by confocal microscopy. Labeling of Intracellular Organelles-Intracellular organelles were identified by incubating MEF on glass coverslips with MitoTracker green (21Keij J.F. Bell-Prince C. Steinkamp J.A. Cytometry. 2000; 39: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), ER tracker green (22Zunkler B.J. Wos-Maganga M. Panten U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 1437-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), NBD-C6-ceramide (23Castedo M. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Macho A. Kroemer G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 512-521PubMed Google Scholar), and LysoTracker Green to label mitochondria, ER, Golgi, and lysosomes, respectively. All the probes (1 μm) were incubated with the cells in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 2 mm Ca2+ for 1 h. Non-internalized probe was then removed from the plasma membrane by incubating the cells for an additional 10 min in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then washed and resuspended in Hanks’ balanced salt solution. Confocal Microscopy-Fluorescent images of live cells following the various treatments were recorded with an Axioplan 2 Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with an Achroplan ×63 water immersion lens. The 488- and 543-nm lines were used and monitored through a 505–530-nm band pass and 560-nm highpass filters, respectively. Sustained Elevation in Cytosolic Ca2+ Is Required for PS Externalization-Previous results from this laboratory have shown that incubation of Jurkat cells with thiol-disulfide exchange reagents results in the immediate and sustained release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores to the cytosol and redistribution of PS from the inner-to-outer membrane leaflet of the cell (3Balasubramanian K. Mirnikjoo B. Schroit A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18357-18364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This occurs in the absence of cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and DNA fragmentation, suggesting that independent mechanisms regulate PS externalization and apoptosis. Indeed, although apoptosis is not reversible (once cytochrome c release is initiated), reduction of reagent-induced disulfides with dithiothreitol reactivated aminophospholipid translocase activity and restored membrane lipid asymmetry (3Balasubramanian K. Mirnikjoo B. Schroit A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18357-18364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Similar to Jurkat cells, PS externalization in MEF can be enforced through the release of Ca2+ from endogenous stores to the cytosol with thiol reagents (3Balasubramanian K. Mirnikjoo B. Schroit A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18357-18364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) or by incubation of the cells in the presence of Ca2+ ionophore/Ca2+ (Fig. 1A). Because thapsigargin triggers release of Ca2+ from ER stores, we determined whether the levels of cytosolic Ca2+ achieved were also sufficient for PS externalization. Fig. 1B shows that the transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels achieved by treating the cells with 50 nm thapsigargin in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ did not result in PS exposure. In the presence of 2 mm extracellular Ca2+, however, the addition of thapsigargin (50 nm) resulted in a fluorescence spike that did not recover to base levels during the time course of the experiment. Similarly, treatment of the cells with 200 nm of thapsigargin also resulted in a significant spike that recovered to a steady-state level (within ∼5 min.) similar to that achieved with 50 nm TG in the presence of Ca2+. Assessment of PS externalization revealed that treatments resulting in sustained steady-state elevations in cytosolic Ca2+ were associated with the appearance of PS at the cell surface (Fig. 1B, inset). It should be noted that FACS analysis within the spike period (∼5 min) failed to detect FITC-annexin V-labeled cells (not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that PS externalization is dependent on sustained elevations in cytosolic Ca2+. Apoptosis-dependent Increase in Cytosolic Ca2+ Levels Is Associated with PS Exposure-The data presented above suggest a direct relationship between the levels of cytosolic Ca2+ and the propensity of cells to externalize PS. To determine whether PS externalization during apoptosis is also related to cytosolic Ca2+ levels, apoptosis was initiated in MEF with STS. At the indicated times, the cells were washed and labeled with Fura-2AM or Rhod-2AM, and cytosolic Ca2+ levels were estimated by fluorescence spectroscopy and confocal microscopy, respectively (Fig. 2). Cells incubated with STS demonstrated a progressive increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels and a concomitant increase in the fraction of annexin V-positive, PS-expressing, cells. Consistent with these observations, the cytosol of Rhod-2-labeled control cells did not fluoresce, indicating very low preapoptosis Ca2+ levels (Fig. 2B). Upon apoptosis, however, a dramatic increase in the intensity of cytosolic fluorescence was observed (Fig. 2C), indicating a significant increase in the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+. Taken together, with the TG results shown in Fig. 1, these data suggest that the propensity of cells to externalize PS is directly dependent on sustained increases in cytosolic [Ca2+]. Rhod-2AM Labeling of Endosomes and Lysosomes-In contrast to the typical mitochondrial staining pattern obtained after incubation of the cells with Rhod-2AM at 4 °C (Figs. 2B and 3A), cells exhibited prominent staining of relatively large vacuole-like organelles when incubated with the probe at 37 °C (Fig. 3B). To identify these organelles, the cells were labeled with known organelle tracking dyes. Double labeling of the cells with MitoTracker green (mitochondria label), NBD-C6-ceramide (Golgi and ER label), or ER tracker green (endoplasmic reticulum label) together with Rhod-2AM at 37 °C indicated that these organelles were distinct from mitochondria, Golgi, and ER, respectively (Fig. 3, C–E). Because the morphology and size of the Rhod-2-labeled organelles were consistent with endocytotic vesicles, we determined whether these structures were pinocytotic Ca2+-containing vesicles by incubating cells with Rhod-2AM in the presence of the aqueous space marker FITC-labeled dextran or the lysosome tracer, LysoTracker Green. Both the probes co-localized to the Rhod-2AM-labeled organelles, indicating that these structures were indeed endosomes (Fig. 3F) and/or lysosomes (Fig. 3G) that acquired their luminal Ca2+ from endocytosed fluid-phase vesicles that sequestered exogenous Ca2+ from the tissue culture medium. Role of Endocytotic Vesicle Ca2+ in PS Externalization-To determine the fate of vesicular Ca2+ in apoptosis-induced PS externalization, endosomes were specifically labeled by incubating MEF in the presence of the cell-impermeable Ca2+ probe, CG1, and the aqueous space marker dextran red. Confocal microscopy of control and apoptotic cells showed that both probes redistributed in an independent manner (Fig. 4). In control cells, the vesicles adopted a preferential perinuclear distribution, and essentially all of them were labeled with both fluorescent probes (Fig. 4A). In apoptotic cells, however, the CG1 fluorescence appeared to be cytosolic, suggesting that Ca2+ entrapped within the vesicles redistributed to the cytosol in an apoptosis-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). The average intensity of CG1 fluorescence in the cytosol of apoptotic cells was ∼1.7-fold higher than in control cells (Fig. 4, center panels). Although these data raise the possibility that vesicular Ca2+ plays a role in apoptosis-dependent PS externalization, it is not clear whether this is an obligatory source of Ca2+. To unequivocally determine whether vesicular Ca2+ is required for PS externalization, MEF were incubated in Ca2+-free medium that was substituted with 2 mm Mg2+ during the time course of the experiment. The rationale for this experimental design was to generate cells that contained Ca2+-free endocytotic vesicles and trigger apoptosis and to determine the propensity of the apoptotic cells to express PS on their outer membrane leaflet. MEF were labeled with Rhod-2AM at 37 °C for 1 h, and the distribution of fluorescence was monitored before and after triggering apoptosis. The data presented in Fig. 5 indicate that, in contrast to control cells incubated in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 5C), the Rhod-2-containing vesicles in cells incubated in the absence of Ca2+ did not fluoresce, suggesting that these vesicles were indeed Ca2+-free (Fig. 5A). Upon apoptosis (Fig. 5E and analysis of DNA fragmentation, not shown), however, both populations exhibited cytosolic Rhod-2 fluorescence (Fig. 5, B and D). Because the Mg2+-incubated cells did not fluoresce before the initiation of apoptosis (Fig. 5A), the source of Rhod-2 fluorescence was likely from increased cytosolic Ca2+ that originated from organelles other than endocytotic vesicles. Importantly, although the Mg2+-incubated cells were apoptotic, as assessed by activation of caspases (Fig. 5E), PS externalization was inhibited (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, the Ca2+-incubated cells redistributed both Ca2+ from the endocytotic vesicles to the cytosol (Fig. 5, C versus D, red fluorescence) and PS from the inner-to-outer membrane leaflet (annexin V-positive; Fig. 5D). As expected, assessment of cytosolic Ca2+ with Fura2 revealed that lysosomes contributed a significant amount of imported exogenous Ca2+ to the cytosol upon apoptosis (Fig. 5F). cPLA2α Inhibits Release of Lysosomal Ca2+ and PS Externalization-Apoptosis-dependent increases in cytosolic Ca2+ (24Bellomo G. Perotti M. Taddei F. Mirabelli F. Finardi G. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1342-1346PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kong S.K. Fung K.P. Choy Y.M. Lee C.Y. Oncology. 1997; 54: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) are known to activate cytosolic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (26Draper D.W. Harris V.G. Culver C.A. Laster S.M. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2416-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which in turn can lead to lysosomal membrane destabilization (27Burlando B. Marchi B. Panfoli I. Viarengo A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1461-C1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Marchi B. Burlando B. Moore M.N. Viarengo A. Aquat. Toxicol. (Amst.). 2004; 66: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These results raise the possibility that PLA2 plays a role in regulating the release of lysosomal Ca2+. To investigate this possibility, cells containing Rhod-2AM-labeled lysosomes were triggered into apoptosis in the presence and absence of the cytosolic phospholipase A2 inhibitor, cPLA2α. These cells were then assessed for PS externalization, caspase activation, and cytosolic Ca2+. Fig. 6 shows that upon apoptosis, cells incubated in the absence of the inhibitor exhibited intense cytosolic Rhod-2 fluorescence, became annexin V-positive, and generated PS-expressing apoptotic blebs (Fig. 6B and inset). Cells incubated with cPLA2α, however, appeared to contain less intense cytosolic Rhod-2 fluorescence, did not generate apoptotic blebs, and contained a significantly lower fraction of annexin V-positive cells. To confirm that cPLA2α indeed inhibited the release of lysosomal Ca2+, duplicate cultures were assessed for cytosolic Ca2+ with Fura-2AM. Fig. 6F shows that in the presence of cPLA2α, cytosolic Ca2+ levels were reduced by ∼40%. Importantly, cPLA2α had no effect on apoptosis as assessed by caspase activation (Fig. 6E and DNA fragmentation, not shown). Apoptosis is a highly regulated process that involves multiple upstream checkpoints that control a variety of sequentially activated pathways. For example, the release of Ca2+ from the ER and its subsequent uptake into mitochondria initiate organelle remodeling that results in loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (16Szalai G. Krishnamurthy R. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6349-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 17Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J.

Oncogene. 2008; 27: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), opening of the permeability transition pore, and release of factors that trigger apoptosis. Clearly, Ca2+ homeostasis and alterations in amplitude and its spatial and temporal patterns play a central role in regulating cell death. Ca2+ has also been shown to play a critical role in the movement of PS from the inner-to-outer bilayer leaflet of the cells. Unlike the complex Ca2+ transients involved in apoptosis, PS externalization only requires temporal elevations in cytosolic [Ca2+]. Because PS externalization is one of the earliest consequences of apoptosis that precedes cytochrome c release and caspase activation, we initiated an investigation into the source of Ca2+ that might regulate the redistribution of PS between bilayer leaflets. The data presented in Fig. 1 indicate that PS externalization is associated with elevation of cytosolic Ca2+. However, the TG data indicate that PS externalization requires not only elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels but that these levels need to persist to initiate the transbilayer redistribution of PS. Similarly, treatment of cells with apoptosis-inducing agents resulted in concomitant increases in both cytosolic Ca2+ and cell surface PS (Fig. 2). Preliminary experiments to determine optimal labeling of MEF mitochondria with Rhod-2AM revealed that organelle specificity was lost when the probe was incubated with the cells at 37 °C (Fig. 3A). Organelle-specific probes showed that the Rhod-2 colocalized with both endosomes and lysosomes (Fig. 3, F and G). Because the fluorescence of Rhod-2 is directly proportional to [Ca2+], these organelles likely contained relatively high [Ca2+]. Indeed, endocytotic pathways can provide a significant amount of cellular calcium because uptake of the ion takes place through pinocytosis of the extracellular medium (30Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Gerasimenko O.V. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1335-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Using rhodamine-labeled dextran in combination with the cell-impermeable Ca2+ probe, CG1, we showed that upon apoptosis, both probes redistributed independently (Fig. 4). Although the rhodamine-dextran was retained within the vesicles, the redistribution of CG1 fluorescence indicated that both Ca2+ and CG1 were transferred from the vesicles to the cytosol. Taken together, these data are consistent with endocytosed Ca2+ being released from the lumen of lysosomes and used to mediate membrane events that regulate PS externalization. To directly determine the potential contribution of vesicular Ca2+ to PS externalization, the propensity of MEF containing Ca2+-free and Ca2+-containing vesicles to undergo cell death and externalize PS was determined. This key experiment demonstrated that although the Ca2+ present in intracellular organelles (ER and mitochondria) is sufficient for apoptosis, the spatial redistribution of vesicular Ca2+ to the cytosol was critical for PS externalization (Fig. 5). Because cytosolic PLA2 is known to affect lysosome stability (27Burlando B. Marchi B. Panfoli I. Viarengo A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1461-C1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Marchi B. Burlando B. Moore M.N. Viarengo A. Aquat. Toxicol. (Amst.). 2004; 66: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), it is possible that activated PLA2 promotes the release of lysosomal Ca2+. To test this, MEF were triggered into apoptosis in the absence and presence of the PLA2 inhibitor cPLA2α. The data presented in Fig. 6 indicate that inhibition of PLA2 reduced the level of cytosolic Ca2+ by ∼40% but completely inhibited PS externalization. Because cytosolic Ca2+ levels were not completely inhibited (Fig. 6F) and the Rhod-2-labeled lysosomes remained intensely fluorescent (Fig. 6D), it is possible that the increase observed was due to release from other organelles. Because PLA2 is activated with Ca2+, these data raise the possibility that Ca2+ released from other organelles during apoptosis activates the enzyme, which in turn destabilizes the lysosomes to release additional Ca2+ to levels that are sufficient for PS externalization. In summary, the data presented here indicate that although apoptosis and PS externalization are both regulated through a common cytosolic Ca2+-dependent pathways, PS externalization requires higher cytosolic [Ca2+] that is only achievable through the contribution of imported vesicular Ca2+, which is released to the cytosol in an apoptosis-dependent manner. Although these studies addressed the source of Ca2+, the actual mechanism by which increased cytosolic Ca2+ redistributes PS between bilayer leaflets remains elusive. Our data do, however, establish the concept that a vesicular Ca2+-dependent signaling mechanism is primarily responsible for the regulation of PS externalization during apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2066680403,"Background Few studies have been conducted in Uganda to identify and quantify the determinants of HIV-1 infection. We report results from a community-based cohort study, whose primary objectives were to determine HIV-1 prevalence, incidence, and determinants of these infections, among other objectives. Methodology Consenting volunteers from the rural district of Kayunga in Uganda aged 15–49 years were enrolled between March and July 2006. Participants were evaluated every six months. A questionnaire that collected information on behavioral and other HIV-1 risk factors was administered, and a blood sample obtained for laboratory analysis at each study visit. Principal Findings HIV-1 prevalence among the 2025 participants was 9.9% (95% CI = 8.6%–11.2%). By the end of 12 months of follow-up, 1689.7 person-years had been accumulated, with a median follow-up time of 11.97 months. Thirteen HIV-1 incident cases were detected giving an annual HIV-1 incidence of 0.77% (95% CI = 0.35–1.19). Prevalence of HSV-2 infection was 57% and was strongly associated with prevalent HIV-1 infection (adjusted Odds Ratio = 3.9, 95% CI = 2.50–6.17); as well as incident HIV-1 infection (adjusted Rate Ratio (RR) = 8.7, 95% CI = 1.11–67.2). The single most important behavioral characteristic associated with incident HIV infection was the number of times in the past 6 months, a participant had sex with person(s) they suspected/knew were having sex with others; attaining statistical significance at 10 times and higher (adjusted RR = 6.3, 95% CI = 1.73–23.1). By the end of 12 months of follow-up, 259 participants (13%) were lost to follow-up, 13 (0.6%) had died, and 2 (0.1%) had withdrawn consent. Conclusions Despite relatively low HIV-1 incidence observed in this community, prevalence remains relatively high. In the presence of high prevalence of HSV-2 infection and the behavioral characteristic of having sex with more than one partner, there is potential for increase in HIV-1 incidence."
https://openalex.org/W2081912369,"Spinosyn, a potent insecticide, is a novel tetracyclic polyketide decorated with d-forosamine and tri-O-methyl-L-rhamnose. Spinosyn rhamnosyltransferase (SpnG) is a key biocatalyst with unique sequence identity and controls the biosynthetic maturation of spinosyn. The rhamnose is critical for the spinosyn insecticidal activity and cell wall biosynthesis of the spinosyn producer, Saccharopolyspora spinosa. In this study, we have functionally expressed and characterized SpnG and the three enzymes, Gdh, Epi, and Kre, responsible for dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis in S. spinosa by purified enzymes from Escherichia coli. Most notably, the substrate specificity of SpnG was thoroughly characterized by kinetic and inhibition experiments using various NDP sugar analogs made by an in situ combination of NDP-sugar-modifying enzymes. SpnG was found to exhibit striking substrate promiscuity, yielding corresponding glycosylated variants. Moreover, the critical residues presumably involved in catalytic mechanism of Gdh and SpnG were functionally evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis. The information gained from this study has provided important insight into molecular recognition and mechanism of the enzymes, especially SpnG. The results have made possible the structure-activity characterization of SpnG, as well as the use of SpnG or its engineered form to serve as a combinatorial tool to make spinosyn analogs with altered biological activities and potency."
https://openalex.org/W1982457556,"Reproductive capacity and nutritional input are tightly linked and animals' specific responses to alterations in their physical environment and food availability are crucial to ensuring sustainability of that species. We have assessed how alterations in dietary energy intake (both reductions and excess), as well as in food availability, via intermittent fasting (IF), affect the gonadal transcriptome of both male and female rats. Starting at four months of age, male and female rats were subjected to a 20% or 40% caloric restriction (CR) dietary regime, every other day feeding (IF) or a high fat-high glucose (HFG) diet for six months. The transcriptional activity of the gonadal response to these variations in dietary energy intake was assessed at the individual gene level as well as at the parametric functional level. At the individual gene level, the females showed a higher degree of coherency in gonadal gene alterations to CR than the males. The gonadal transcriptional and hormonal response to IF was also significantly different between the male and female rats. The number of genes significantly regulated by IF in male animals was almost 5 times greater than in the females. These IF males also showed the highest testosterone to estrogen ratio in their plasma. Our data show that at the level of gonadal gene responses, the male rats on the IF regime adapt to their environment in a manner that is expected to increase the probability of eventual fertilization of females that the males predict are likely to be sub-fertile due to their perception of a food deficient environment."
https://openalex.org/W1977522637,"In bacterial pathogenesis, virulence gene regulation is controlled by two-component regulatory systems. In Escherichia coli, the EnvZ/OmpR two-component system is best understood as regulating expression of outer membrane proteins, but in Salmonella enterica, OmpR activates transcription of the SsrA/B two-component system located on Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2). The response regulator SsrB controls expression of a type III secretory system in which effectors modify the vacuolar membrane and prevent its degradation via the endocytic pathway. Vacuolar modification enables Salmonella to survive and replicate in the macrophage phagosome and disseminate to the liver and spleen to cause systemic infection. The signals that activate EnvZ and SsrA are unknown but are related to the acidic pH encountered in the vacuole. Our previous work established that SsrB binds to regions of DNA that are AT-rich, with poor sequence conservation. Although SsrB is a major virulence regulator in Salmonella, very little is known regarding how it binds DNA and activates transcription. In the present work, we solved the structure of the C-terminal DNA binding domain of SsrB (SsrB(C)) by NMR and analyzed the effect of amino acid substitutions on function. We identified residues in the DNA recognition helix (Lys(179), Met(186)) and the dimerization interface (Val(197), Leu(201)) that are important for SsrB transcriptional activation and DNA binding. An essential cysteine residue in the N-terminal receiver domain was also identified (Cys(45)), and the effect of Cys(203) on dimerization was evaluated. Our results suggest that although disulfide bond formation is not required for dimerization, dimerization occurs upon DNA binding and is required for subsequent activation of transcription. Disruption of the dimer interface by a C203E substitution reduces SsrB activity. Modification of Cys(203) or Cys(45) may be an important mode of SsrB inactivation inside the host."
https://openalex.org/W1999738340,"Background The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase protein (IN), catalyzes the integration of viral DNA into the host cell genome. IN catalyzes the first step of the integration process, namely the 3′-end processing in which IN removes a pGT dinucleotide from the 3′ end of each viral long terminal repeat (LTR). Following nuclear import of the viral preintegration complex, the host chromosomal DNA becomes accessible to the viral cDNA and the second step of the integration process, namely the strand-transfer step takes place. This ordered sequence of events, centered on integration, is mandatory for HIV replication. Methodology/Principal Findings Using an integrase peptide library, we selected two peptides, designated INr-1 and INr-2, which interact with the Rev protein and probably mediate the Rev-integrase interaction. Using an in-vitro assay system, we show that INr-1 and INr-2 are able to abrogate the inhibitory effects exerted by Rev and Rev-derived peptides on integrase activity. Both INr-1 and INr-2 were found to be cell-permeable and nontoxic, allowing a study of their effect in HIV-1-infected cultured cells. Interestingly, both INr peptides stimulated virus infectivity as estimated by production of the viral P24 protein, as well as by determination of the appearance of newly formed virus particles. Furthermore, kinetics studies revealed that the cell-permeable INr peptides enhance the integration process, as was indeed confirmed by direct determination of viral DNA integration by real-time PCR. Conclusions/Significance The results of the present study raise the possibility that in HIV-infected cells, the Rev protein may be involved in the integration of proviral DNA by controlling/regulating the activity of the integrase. Release from such inhibition leads to stimulation of IN activity and multiple viral DNA integration events."
https://openalex.org/W2153240720,"Retinoblastoma (RB), a carcinoma of the retina, is caused by mutations in the long arm of chromosome 13, band 13q14. The esterase D (ESD) gene maps at a similar location as the RB gene locus and therefore serves as a potential marker for the prognosis of retinoblastoma. Because very little is known about the structure and function of ESD, we determined the 3-dimensional structure of the enzyme at 1.5 A resolution using X-ray crystallography. ESD shows a single domain with an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold. A number of insertions are observed in the canonical alpha/beta-hydrolase fold. The active site is located in a positively charged, shallow cleft on the surface lined by a number of aromatic residues. Superimposition studies helped identify the typical catalytic triad residues--Ser-153, His264, and Asp230--involved in catalysis. Mutagenesis of any of the catalytic triad residues to alanine abolished the enzyme activity. Backbone amides of Leu54 and Met150 are involved in the formation of the oxyanion hole. Interestingly, a M150A mutation increased the enzyme activity by 62%. The structure of human ESD determined in this study will aid the elucidation of the physiological role of the enzyme in the human body and will assist in the early diagnosis of retinoblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2030799118,"To gain an understanding of the genomic structure and evolutionary history of the giant panda major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, we determined a 636,503-bp nucleotide sequence spanning the MHC class II region. Analysis revealed that the MHC class II region from this rare species contained 26 loci (17 predicted to be expressed), of which 10 are classical class II genes (1 DRA, 2 DRB, 2 DQA, 3 DQB, 1 DYB, 1 DPA, and 2 DPB) and 4 are non-classical class II genes (1 DOA, 1 DOB, 1 DMA, and 1 DMB). The presence of DYB, a gene specific to ruminants, prompted a comparison of the giant panda class II sequence with those of humans, cats, dogs, cattle, pigs, and mice. The results indicated that birth and death events within the DQ and DRB-DY regions led to major lineage differences, with absence of these regions in the cat and in humans and mice respectively. The phylogenetic trees constructed using all expressed alpha and beta genes from marsupials and placental mammals showed that: (1) because marsupials carry loci corresponding to DR, DP, DO and DM genes, those subregions most likely developed before the divergence of marsupials and placental mammals, approximately 150 million years ago (MYA); (2) conversely, the DQ and DY regions must have evolved later, but before the radiation of placental mammals (100 MYA). As a result, the typical genomic structure of MHC class II genes for the giant panda is similar to that of the other placental mammals and corresponds to BTNL2 approximately DR1 approximately DQ approximately DR2 approximately DY approximately DO_box approximately DP approximately COL11A2. Over the past 100 million years, there has been birth and death of mammalian DR, DQ, DY, and DP genes, an evolutionary process that has brought about the current species-specific genomic structure of the MHC class II region. Furthermore, facing certain similar pathogens, mammals have adopted intra-subregion (DR and DQ) and inter-subregion (between DQ and DP) convergent evolutionary strategies for their alpha and beta genes, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2084826946,"Little is known about the intracellular folding and trafficking of integral membrane proteins. Here we identify a hydrophobic amino acid tetrad (ILLV) close to the C terminus of the secretory Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC1) that is important for the proper intracellular processing of this protein. This tetrad appears in a C-terminal sequence pattern that is conserved across species in a number of members of the NKCC1 gene family (slc12) of electroneutral salt transporters. We studied the effects of various mutations of these amino acids on NKCC1 transiently transfected into HEK-293 cells. Our results show that mutation of two of these residues to alanine leads to a >50% reduction in expression and complex glycosylation levels and that multiple mutations to alanine have cumulative effects. By contrast, scrambling of these amino acids, or mutation of other nearby conserved C-terminal residues, has little effect on these parameters. Mutation of ILLV to AAAA reduces complex glycosylation of NKCC1 by ∼90% and results in a protein that does not form stable dimers and is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum in a highly aggregated state.

These processes are mediated by ER chaperone activity and by targeting signals coded into the amino acid sequence of the protein itself. Quality control mechanisms in the ER typically ensure that proteins that do not fold or oligomerize correctly are retained in the ER and eventually degraded (2Kopito R.R.

As a result, there has been increasing interest in understanding and modifying these aberrant phenomena. The electroneutral cation-chloride-coupled cotransporter gene family (slc12) contains nine members in vertebrates. These include two Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporters (NKCC1 and NKCC2), a Na+-Cl- cotransporter (NCC), four K+-Cl- cotransporters (KCC1, KCC2, KCC3, and KCC4), and two other homologues of unknown function. Members of the Slc12 family are known to play important roles in numerous physiological processes, including exocrine fluid secretion, renal salt and water absorption, hearing, olfaction, spermatogenesis, pain perception, visual processing, and other neuronal functions (11Gamba G.

A multiple alignment of Slc12 amino acid sequences reveals a C-terminal sequence pattern that is conserved in all vertebrate NKCCs, NCCs, and KCCs, as well as in a variety of Slc12 homologues from other nonvertebrate species, specifically xxxxhhhhRGxxxxVhThYx, where h and x represent hydrophobic and variable amino acids, respectively. In many cases, the hydrophobic tetrad hhhh includes a central dileucine motif. Here we study the effects of mutations of the above sequence pattern using the secretory Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter NKCC1 as a model Slc12 protein. Our results indicate that modifications of the sequence downstream of the hydrophobic tetrad (ILLV in NKCC1) have no significant effect on the trafficking of NKCC1 from the ER to the Golgi. However, mutations of the amino acids of the hydrophobic tetrad itself to alanine result in the retention of NKCC1 in the ER and its aggregation, apparently as a result of the ab initio misfolding of the protein. Interestingly, it is conservation of residue hydrophobicity rather than residue identity that appears to underlie the role of this amino acid motif.

The cells growing in a 6-cm culture dish were washed twice in ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) and then suspended in 200 μl of ice-cold TEEA buffer, consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 300 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin A, and 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin. The suspended cells were then homogenized by passing five times through a 25-gauge needle. This material was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was saved. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of TEEA buffer and rehomogenized and centrifuged as before. The combined supernatants from these two homogenization steps were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting crude membrane fraction was resuspended in TEEA. Cross-linking studies were performed on solubilized crude membranes prepared from transiently transfected HEK-293 cells as described previously (15Parvin M.N. Gerelsaikhan T. Turner R.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 9630-9637Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes were suspended in PBS (pH 7.4) at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml (measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine IgG as the standard) and solubilized in 0.3% Triton X-100. The solubilized membranes were then incubated with the homobifunctional amino acid cross-linking reagent DTSSP (1 mm) for 30 min, after which the cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 mm glycine. Aliquots of the crude membrane fraction were deglycosylated by treatment with N-glycosidase F as previously described (31Dohke Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15215-15219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Biotinylation of Intact HEK-293 Cells and Removal of Biotinylated Proteins on Streptavidin Beads-HEK-293 cells growing in a 6-cm culture dish were detached from the plate by incubation in citrate buffer containing 18.6 mm sodium citrate and 134 mm KCl at 37 °C. The suspended cells were then centrifuged at 400 × g for 1 min, washed in 10 ml of PBS (this and all subsequent steps utilized ice-cold PBS at pH 8.0), and suspended in 4–5 ml of PBS. One-ml aliquots were transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 s, washed again with 1 ml of PBS, and resuspended in 0.9 ml of PBS. One hundred μl of freshly prepared EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LCLC-Biotin (25 mm in PBS) was then added to each tube. Tubes were incubated on ice for 2 h with mixing by inversion every 10 min, and then the biotinylation reaction was stopped by the addition of 110 μl of 1 m glycine in PBS. Five min later, the cells were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS and solubilized in 0.6 ml of PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100. After a 30-min incubation on ice, particulate matter was removed by centrifuging at 2000 × g for 10 min. A 300-μl aliquot of the supernatant was combined with 100 μl of immobilized Streptavidin beads (a 50:50 slurry in PBS) and incubated with continuous mixing for 2 h at 4 °C. The material remaining in the supernatant after removal of the beads (i.e. the unbound material) was subsequently compared with the material in the supernatant before the addition of the beads by Western blotting (see “Results”). In control experiments (not shown), we have confirmed by Western blotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin (see below) that this treatment with immobilized Streptavidin beads is sufficient to remove virtually all biotinylated proteins from the solubilized cell supernatant. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay-Co-immunoprecipitation of NKCC1 or the mutant AAAA (see “Results”) with HA-nttNKCC1 was carried out essentially as previously described (15Parvin M.N. Gerelsaikhan T. Turner R.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 9630-9637Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK-293 cells in 6-cm dishes were transiently transfected with full-length NKCC1 (or AAAA) and HA-nttNKCC1 at a plasmid ratio of 1:8 (3 μg of total DNA). Two days later, the cells were washed with PBS, solubilized in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, and immunoprecipitated with the antibody α-wNT(r), which had been preconjugated to Protein G beads (Pierce). After washing, the beads were eluted in 25 μl of PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 plus 0.1% SDS for 30 min on ice. The beads were then centrifuged, and the eluate was removed and mixed with 6 μl of 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The material remaining on the beads was also extracted by adding 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer to the pelleted beads. Equal volumes of each of these samples were probed by Western blotting (see below). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were carried out as previously described (15Parvin M.N. Gerelsaikhan T. Turner R.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 9630-9637Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The primary and secondary antibodies used to detect NKCC1 and its C-terminal mutants in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 were α-wCT(r), used at a dilution of 1:5000, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce), used at a dilution of 1:10,000, respectively. Blots from co-immunoprecipitations of HA-nttNKCC1 with NKCC1 or AAAA were probed with the peroxidase-conjugated rat anti-HA monoclonal 3F10 (Roche Applied Science) at a dilution of 1:1000 to detect HA-nttNKCC1 (Fig. 8) or with α-wNT(r) at a dilution of 1:5000 followed by Trueblue horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (eBioscience) at a dilution of 1:5000 to detect NKCC1 or AAAA (not shown). Detection of horseradish peroxidase was carried out using the ECL kit from Amersham Biosciences according to the manufacturer’s directions. Blots were analyzed by densitometry.FIGURE 3Cell surface expression of wild-type NKCC1 and the AAAA mutant. HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with WT NKCC1 or the AAAA mutant and then incubated with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LCLC-Biotin. The cells were then solubilized, and biotinylated proteins were precipitated on streptavidin (SA) beads (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Aliquots of the cell lysate before (-) and after (+) streptavidin precipitation were probed by Western blotting (inset), and the amount of WT NKCC1 or AAAA mutant was quantitated in each case. The bar graph shows the amount of each protein found in the lysate before (-SA) and after (+SA) precipitation on the beads. Results have been normalized to the signal observed before the addition of the streptavidin beads.

The white bars represent 10 μm. Note that in these experiments, the NKCC1 antibody shows no detectable signal for the endogenous (human) NKCC1 in the HEK-293 cells. This is because the antibody used is relatively selective for the rat protein (15Parvin M.N. Gerelsaikhan T. Turner R.J.

HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with HA-nttNKCC1 and either pBK-, WT NKCC1, or the AAAA mutant, as indicated. Two days later, the cells were solubilized and immunoprecipitated with Protein G beads to which the antibody α-wNT(r), raised against the N terminus of rat NKCC1, had been conjugated. The material eluted from the immunoprecipitate by 0.1% SDS (Eluate) as well the material remaining on the beads (Beads) was then probed by Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody to detect HA-nttNKCC1 (all procedures are described under “Experimental Procedures”). In additional assays in which we probed these blots with the antibodyα-wNT(r) (not shown; see “Experimental Procedures”), we have established that the amount of AAAA immunoprecipitated in these experiments is 0.52 ± 0.02 (n = 2) times that of WT NKCC1 (although, as shown in Fig. 2A, AAAA is expressed at ∼0.2 times the level of WT NKCC1, these experiments (15Parvin M.N.

Immunofluorescent Staining and Confocal Microscopy-Immunofluorescent staining was performed as follows. Transiently transfected HEK-293 cells, grown on poly-l-lysine-coated circular glass coverslips, were rinsed three times with PBS (pH 7.4) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. The cells were then rinsed three times with PBS, incubated with 100 mm glycine in PBS for 20 min, permeabilized with methanol at -20 °C for 5 min, and incubated in a mixture of 5% donkey serum and 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 20 min. Next, the cells were incubated with the antibody α-wCT(r) (diluted 1:3000) for 1 h and then with an Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (diluted 1:200; Invitrogen) for 30 min. After three additional washes in PBS (3 min each), the cells were treated with the SelectFX Alexa Fluor 488 endoplasmic reticulum labeling kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Finally, the cells were washed again three times with PBS before being mounted onto a slide using Vectashield (Vector, Burlingame, CA) containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylinode. Fluorescence images were taken using a confocal laser-scanning microscope, Leica TCS-SP2, attached to an upright Leica DM-RE7 microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). 86Rb Influx Assays-The 86Rb influx experiments were performed as described previously (32Dehaye J.P. Nagy A. Premkumar A. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11811-11817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Data Presentation-All experiments were carried out three or more times with similar results. All quantitative results shown are means ± S.E. from three or more independent experiments. p values ≤ 0.05 (Student’s t test) were taken to represent statically significant differences. In Fig. 1A, we show the C-terminal residues of various Slc12 gene family members, illustrating that a number of these proteins from diverse species have a similar sequence pattern at their C-terminal end, namely xxxxhhhhRGxxxxVhThYx. This pattern is conserved in all vertebrate NKCCs, NCCs, and KCCs sequenced to date. Since all of these latter transporters are known to be plasma membrane proteins and since, as already discussed, the C termini of a number of integral membrane proteins have been shown to play important roles in their intracellular folding and/or trafficking, we wondered whether the conserved features of this pattern might play a similar role for these Slc12 proteins. To explore this possibility, we generated a number of C-terminal (rat) NKCC1 mutants. These mutants can be broken down into three general groups (Fig. 1B). Group I, Mutations of the Hydrophobic Tetrad ILLV-Here we mutated 1–4 of the amino acids in the hydrophobic tetrad ILLV to alanine (mutants 1–6), scrambled their order in the NKCC1 sequence (ILLV to LVIL; mutant 7), added an additional hydrophobic amino acid (ILLV to ILLLV; mutant 8), or truncated the NKCC1 sequence at Pro1187 immediately before the hydrophobic tetrad (mutant 9). Group II, Mutations of the Highly Conserved Amino Acids Downstream of the ILLV Hydrophobic Tetrad-Mutations were generated by switching amino acid positions (Arg1192 and Gly1193; mutant 10) or by replacement with methionine (mutant 11) or alanine (mutants 12 and 13). Group III, Insertion Mutants-Here we inserted an extra alanine at various positions in the NKCC1 C-terminal sequence (mutants 14–17). Our rationale here was to attempt to disrupt potentially important sequence patterns by changing the relative spacing between residues. NKCC1 contains two glycosylation consensus sites in the extracellular loop between its seventh and eighth membrane-spanning segments. In cells, NKCC1 is first core-glycosylated at one or both of these sites as it is synthesized in the ER and then subsequently complex glycosylated after it reaches the Golgi apparatus.

https://openalex.org/W1993966957,"Background Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), the pathogen that causes tuberculosis, is capable of staying asymptomatically in a latent form, persisting for years in very low replicating state, before getting reactivated to cause active infection. It is therefore important to study M.tb chromosome replication, specifically its initiation and regulation. While the region between dnaA and dnaN gene is capable of autonomous replication, little is known about the interaction between DnaA initiator protein, oriC origin of replication sequences and their negative effectors of replication. Methodology/Principal Findings By KMnO4 mapping assays the sequences involved in open complex formation within oriC, mediated by M.tb DnaA protein, were mapped to position −500 to −518 with respect to the dnaN gene. Contrary to E. coli, the M.tb DnaA in the presence of non-hydrolysable analogue of ATP (ATPγS) was unable to participate in helix opening thereby pointing to the importance of ATP hydrolysis. Interestingly, ATPase activity in the presence of supercoiled template was higher than that observed for DnaA box alone. M.tb rRv1985c, a homologue of E.coli IciA (Inhibitor of chromosomal initiation) protein, could inhibit DnaA-mediated in-vitro helix opening by specifically binding to A+T rich region of oriC, provided the open complex formation had not initiated. rIciA could also inhibit in-vitro replication of plasmid carrying the M.tb origin of replication. Conclusions/Significance These results have a bearing on the functional role of the important regulator of M.tb chromosomal replication belonging to the LysR family of bacterial regulatory proteins in the context of latency."
https://openalex.org/W2010895009,"Chemical signals can yield information about an animal such as its identity, social status or sex. Such signals have rarely been considered in birds, but recent results have shown that chemical signals are actually used by different bird species to find food and to recognize their home and nest. This is particularly true in petrels whose olfactory anatomy is among the most developed in birds. Recently, we have demonstrated that Antarctic prions, Pachyptila desolata, are also able to recognize and follow the odour of their partner in a Y-maze.However, the experimental protocol left unclear whether this choice reflected an olfactory recognition of a particular individual (i.e. partner) or a more general sex recognition mechanism. To test this second hypothesis, male and female birds' odours were presented simultaneously to 54 Antarctic prions in a Y-maze. Results showed random behaviour by the tested bird, independent of its sex or reproductive status. Present results do not support the possibility that Antarctic prions can distinguish the sex of a conspecific through its odour but indirectly support the hypothesis that they can distinguish individual odours."
https://openalex.org/W2153011908,"Many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) possess a putative cytoplasmic helical domain, termed helix 8 (H8), at the proximal region of the C-terminal tail. However, the significance of this domain is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate the requirement of H8 for the proper folding of GPCRs for passage through the quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the human leukotriene B(4) type-2 receptor (hBLT2), lack of H8 led to an accumulation of the receptor (hBLT2/DeltaH8) in the ER. Similar results were obtained in two representative human GPCRs, dopamine type-1 and lysophosphatidic acid type-2 receptors, which were engineered to lack H8. Treatment with the several ligands, which act as pharmacological chaperones, facilitated the surface expression of hBLT2/DeltaH8. The surface-trafficked hBLT2/DeltaH8 exhibited an agonist-evoked increase in Ca(2+), demonstrating that H8 is not critical for ligand binding and activation of coupled G proteins. Thus, these results suggest that the H8 region of hBLT2 plays an important role in transport-competent receptor folding."
https://openalex.org/W2073819271,"The molecular mechanisms that regulate invertebrate visual pigment absorption are poorly understood. Through sequence analysis and functional investigation of vertebrate visual pigments, numerous amino acid substitutions important for this adaptive process have been identified. Here we describe a serine/alanine (S/A) substitution in long wavelength-absorbing Drosophila visual pigments that occurs at a site corresponding to Ala-292 in bovine rhodopsin. This S/A substitution accounts for a 10–17-nm absorption shift in visual pigments of this class. Additionally, we demonstrate that substitution of a cysteine at the same site, as occurs in the blue-absorbing Rh5 pigment, accounts for a 4-nm shift. Substitutions at this site are the first spectrally significant amino acid changes to be identified for invertebrate pigments sensitive to visible light and are the first evidence of a conserved tuning mechanism in vertebrate and invertebrate pigments of this class.

Organisms use color vision for survival behaviors such as foraging, mating, and predator avoidance (1Maximov V.V. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 1239-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 2Dyer A.G. Chittka L. J. Exp. Biol. 2004; 207: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 3Detto T. Proc. Biol. Sci. R. Soc. Lond. 2007; 274: 2785-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Color vision in invertebrates ranges from trichromatic systems capable of detecting UV, blue, and green (e.g. bees and flies) to the highly complex mantis shrimps (stomatopods) having 12 spectrally distinct classes of photoreceptor cells (4Marshall J. Cronin T.W. Kleinlogel S. Arthropod Struct. Dev. 2007; 36: 420-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Despite the diversity of invertebrate color vision systems and the large collection of naturally occurring visual pigments, important questions remain concerning the molecular mechanisms that regulate color sensitivity.In both vertebrates and invertebrates, the visual pigment rhodopsin consists of a chromophore (e.g. 11-cis retinal) covalently bound to an opsin apoprotein via a protonated Schiff base. Upon light absorption, the chromophore isomerizes from cis to all-trans, inducing conformational changes in the opsin that produce activated metarhodopsin. Specific interactions between the retinal chromophore and residues in the opsin tune the λmax of the chromophore. Studies have shown that Glu-113 (bovine position) serves as the retinylidene Schiff base counter-ion in vertebrate visual pigments (5Zhukovsky E.A. Oprian D.D. Science. 1989; 246: 928-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 6Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Removing the negative charge of the counter-ion from the binding pocket deprotonates the chromophore and yields a UV-absorbing pigment (5Zhukovsky E.A. Oprian D.D.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6025-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).In contrast, the counter-ion for invertebrate rhodopsin remains unknown, and only one spectrally relevant residue has been identified: an amino acid substitution in Drosophila pigments responsible for UV versus visible sensitivity (9Salcedo E. Zheng L. Phistry M. Bagg E.E. Britt S.G. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10873-10878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this amino acid substitution (Gly-90 in bovine rhodopsin) coincides with a substitution that mediates UV versus blue sensitivity in several bird species (10Yokoyama S. Radlwimmer F.B.

This discovery highlights the value of a cross-phyla comparison of visual pigments as a means to identify structural differences that may regulate color vision in invertebrates.In the present study, we identify an amino acid substitution in Drosophila visual pigments that regulates the color sensitivity of blue- and green-absorbing rhodopsins. For these studies, we employed sequence analysis of invertebrate and vertebrate visual pigments and a functional examination of mutant invertebrate opsins. This amino acid substitution red-shifts the λmax of the Drosophila Rh1 pigment and reciprocally blue-shifts the λmax of Rh6 pigment. Interestingly, this site also affects the spectral tuning of vertebrate pigments and corresponds to Ala-292 in bovine rhodopsin (8Takahashi Y. Ebrey T.G.

The structure was minimized 5000 steps using NAMD (22Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kale L. Schulten K. J. Comput.

The retinal molecule from bovine rhodopsin was placed into Rh1 at lysine 319, creating a lysine-bound retinal (LYR-319). The retinal molecule was modified to 3-hydroxyretinal using VMD (25Humphrey W.

In the mutant models, alanine 315 was mutated to serine (Rh1A315S) or cysteine (Rh1A315C) and minimized 5000 steps with NAMD. Subsequently, all three models underwent the same procedure. Internal water molecules were placed using DOWSER (32Zhang L. Hermans J. Proteins. 1996; 24: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) followed by a 6000-step minimization. The proteins were embedded in a membrane of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylchlorine with VMD. Full solvation with TIP3 water molecules, neutralization, and the addition of sodium and chloride ions were performed with VMD. The resulting models were 93 × 94 × 97 Å containing 12,525 water molecules. Full particle mesh Ewald calculations for electrostatics were used for all simulations. To relax the system, the following were used: a 20-ps run with protein backbone and LYR-319 fixed; a 50-ps run with protein backbone and LYR-319 residue harmonically constrained; a 50-ps run with LYR-319 residue harmonically constrained; and then a 2-ns run with no constraints. For comparison of the wild-type Drosophila Rh1 model with the published squid rhodopsin crystal structure (PDB entry 2z73), we used the STRAP program as noted above (24Gille C. Frommel C. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2001; 17: 377-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 33Murakami M. Kouyama T. Nature. 2008; 453: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar).RESULTSTo identify spectral tuning sites in the invertebrate pigment population, we performed an alignment of the six well characterized Drosophila opsins and generated a phylogenetic tree to evaluate their relatedness. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of invertebrate pigments was published recently (34Porter M.L. Cronin T.W. McClellan D.A. Crandall K.A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 253-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The Drosophila visual pigments represent almost all of the major classes of visual pigments within the invertebrate lineage including ultraviolet, blue, middle wavelength-sensitive (MWS), and long wavelength-sensitive (LWS) pigments, Fig. 1. The phylogenetic relationship between pigments of different spectral types is conserved in most other species (e.g. insect UV and blue pigments are derived from the same lineage).We then examined the sequences of the Drosophila pigments at sites known to influence the spectral tuning of vertebrate visual pigments (reviewed in Ref. 8Takahashi Y. Ebrey T.G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6025-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We isolated potentially spectrally relevant residues by identifying amino acids that were conserved in a given spectral family of opsins but that differed in the other opsin families. Such a relationship between amino acid substitution and absorption maxima variation has been extensively substantiated in the vertebrate visual pigment lineages.As the result of this analysis, we identified an amino acid substitution within the Drosophila opsins that corresponds to a spectral tuning site identified in the vertebrate pigments at amino acid position 292 (bovine opsin numbering). Mutagenesis experiments at this site in a variety of pigments have shown that A292S or S292A mutants demonstrate substantial blue and red spectral shifts, respectively (8Takahashi Y. Ebrey T.G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6025-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Sun H. Macke J.P. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7219-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the LWS Drosophila Rh6 has a serine at this position, whereas the UV-sensitive Rh3 and Rh4 and MWS Rh1 and Rh2 have an alanine, and the blue-sensitive Rh5 has a cysteine at this position. This relationship is conserved in other invertebrate pigments. The mollusk rhodopsins contain valine, the arthropod LWS pigments contain serine or tyrosine, the arthropod MWS pigments contain alanine, and the insect blue and UV pigments contain alanine at this position, except for Drosophila Rh5 noted above.To investigate the role that this amino acid substitution plays in tuning the spectral properties of invertebrate pigments, we constructed mutant forms of the blue-absorbing (Rh1) and green-absorbing (Rh6) Drosophila opsins, as described previously (9Salcedo E. Zheng L. Phistry M. Bagg E.E. Britt S.G. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10873-10878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these mutant forms, we replaced the residue in one pigment with the corresponding residue found in the other (i.e. Rh1 A315S and Rh6 S313A). In addition, we generated an Rh1 mutant that contains the cysteine found in the same position of Rh5. To determine the effect that these amino acid changes have on the absorption properties of the visual pigments, we introduced the genes encoding these modified pigments (as well as their non-modified counterparts) into the germline of transgenic Drosophila containing the ninaE mutation. ninaE is a deletion in the endogenous Rh1 gene that is expressed in the R1–6 photoreceptor cells (19O'Tousa J.E. Baehr W. Martin R.L. Hirsh J. Pak W.L. Applebury M.L. Cell. 1985; 40: 839-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 35Zuker C.S. Cowman A.F. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1985; 40: 851-858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). By placing the transgene under the control of the Rh1 promoter, we exchanged the function of the endogenous Rh1 pigment with the pigment of interest.As shown in Fig. 2A, electrophysiological analysis of the transgenic animals expressing Rh6 S313A showed a dramatic red shift in spectral sensitivity when compared with the animals expressing the unmodified form of the Rh6 pigment (from a λmax = 514 nm to a λmax = 531 nm). In comparison, transgenic animals expressing Rh1 A315S had a complimentary blue shift in sensitivity (from a λmax = 480 nm to a λmax = 470 nm) when compared with wild-type animals that express the endogenous Rh1 pigment, Fig. 2b. Furthermore, transgenic animals expressing Rh1 A315C also had a blue shift in sensitivity (from a λmax = 480 nm to a λmax = 476 nm) (Fig. 2b). Thus, the Ser versus Ala substitution appears to be responsible for dramatic shifts in the absorption of Rh6 (∼17-nm shift) and Rh1 (∼10-nm shift), whereas the Cys versus Ala substitution seems to be responsible for a smaller but significant shift in absorption for Rh1 (∼4-nm shift). These results confirm the importance of this site for spectral tuning of invertebrate pigments and are consistent with the results reported for substitutions at this site in the vertebrate pigments.FIGURE 2Rh1 and Rh6 spectral sensitivities and rhodopsin/metarhodopsin difference spectra. a and b, measured spectral sensitivities of flies expressing Rh1, Rh6, or one of the modified rhodopsin pigments in the R1–6 photoreceptor cells (solid lines). Each sensitivity spectrum obtained in this study was also fit to a rhodopsin absorption nomogram (dotted lines). a, mean spectral sensitivities of flies expressing Rh6 S313A (black line) when compared with flies expressing the unmodified Rh6 pigment (gray line). The nomogram curve fit for Rh6 S313A has a λmax red-shifted from the unmodified pigment 17 nm (dotted lines). For all sensitivity data, the λmax, correlation coefficient, and number of flies examined are indicated in Table 1. b, mean spectral sensitivities of flies expressing the rhodopsin mutants, Rh1 A315S, and Rh1 A315C (black lines) when compared with the unmodified Rh1 pigment (gray line). The large peak in the UV region occurs because of the action of a sensitizing pigment that absorbs in the UV and activates the Rh1 rhodopsin through energy transfer. The peaks in the visible region are due to direct absorption by the visual pigment itself. The nomogram curve fits for Rh1 A315C and Rh1 A315S λmax are blue-shifted 4 and 10 nm, respectively (inset). The fine structure noted in the sensitivity spectra in the region of 475 nm is an artifact and results from spectral spikes in xenon lamp output in this region. c–f, difference spectra were measured by in vivo MSP of flies expressing Rh1 or one of the modified rhodopsin pigments. c, mean difference spectra of Rh1 (gray line) when compared with Rh1 A315S and Rh1 A315C (black lines). d–f, calculated R and M absorption spectra based on nomogram curve fitting to the measured difference spectra (DS).

For MSP data, the λmax, correlation coefficient, and number of flies examined are indicated in Table 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Photoactivation of rhodopsin occurs upon absorption of a photon by the retinal chromophore. This induces the isomerization of the 11–12-cis double bond to the trans configuration, which then induces a series of conformational changes in the protein that leads to its activation and the formation of metarhodopsin. To determine the absorption profile of the metarhodopsin (M) forms of the modified Rh1 pigments, we used microspectrophotometry (MSP) to examine dissected retina from transgenic flies and wild-type flies (Fig. 2c). The M-form of Rh1 A315S has a λmax = 524 nm, whereas the M-form of Rh1 A315C has a λmax = 548 nm, dramatic shifts of 36 and 12 nm, respectively, from wild-type Rh1 (Fig. 2, d–f). We were unable to record a difference spectrum from transgenic animals expressing the Rh6 S313A construct, consistent with previous studies of unmodified Rh6 (17Salcedo E. Huber A. Henrich S. Chadwell L.V. Chou W.H. Paulsen R. Britt S.G. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10716-10726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that this amino acid substitution is important for regulating the tuning of both R-form and M-form absorption.To evaluate the structural effects of amino acid substitutions, we generated structural models of Rh1 wild type, Rh1A315S, and Rh1A315C using molecular dynamics methods. As expected, the overall topology of the structural models is very similar to that of bovine rhodopsin, upon which they are based. The root mean square deviation, the average distance between the atoms of superimposed proteins, for each pairwise structural model comparison was as follows: Rh1 wild type – Rh1A315C = 5.6 Å, Rh1 wild type – Rh1A315S = 4.2 Å, and Rh1A315S – Rh1A315C = 4.9 Å. Overall, this demonstrates a very close fit between the structures as a whole, although Rh1 wild type and Rh1A315S show a higher degree of overlap with each other than they do with the Rh1A315C mutant. The amino side chains within 3.2 Å of the retinal chromophore in the model of Rh1 wild type are shown in Fig. 3a. Fig. 3, b–d, show residue 315 in the wild-type and mutant pigments in very close proximity to the Schiff base nitrogen. The distances were 4.8 Å to Ala in Rh1 wild type, 4.2 Å to Ser in Rh1A315S, and 4.3 Å to Cys in Rh1A315C. We examined the topology of the retinal chromophore and found that although the geometry of the polyene chain in each model overlaps to a substantial degree, the β-ionone ring is rotated in the models of the mutant pigments by 140 (Rh1A315S) or 190 (Rh1A315C) degrees when compared with Rh1 wild type (Fig. 3e). Higher resolution images of the models can be found in supplemental Figs. 1–3. We also compared the model of wild-type Rh1 with the recently published squid rhodopsin crystal structure (33Murakami M. Kouyama T. Nature. 2008; 453: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and found a high degree of similarity between the two structures (Fig. 3f). There is a substantial overlap between the helical regions of the proteins and close approximation between the two chromophore structures. Root mean square deviation for the comparison between the two structures was 2.7 Å. We examined the region of the squid rhodopsin chromophore binding site and found that, similar to the three Drosophila models, the residue corresponding to Ala-315 in Rh1 (squid Val-301) is in close proximity to the Schiff base nitrogen (Fig. 3g). The distances from the Schiff base nitrogen to the carbon atoms of the two methyl groups in the Val-301 side chain were 4.5 and 5.5 Å. A higher resolution image of the squid rhodopsin structure can be found in supplemental Fig. 4.FIGURE 3Molecular modeling of Drosophila Rh1 wild-type, Rh1A315S, and Rh1A315C mutant pigments. a, model of Drosophila Rh1 wild-type pigment showing all residues within 3.2 Å of the lysine-bound Schiff base chromophore. b–d, close-up views of the Schiff base nitrogen and residue 315 in Rh1 wild type (b), Rh1A315S (c), and Rh1A315C (d).

These results are consistent with previous studies on vertebrate visual pigments that demonstrated a 9–10-nm blue shift in A292S mutant forms of bovine rhodopsin and other pigments (8Takahashi Y.

The results are also consistent with studies of the mouse green cone pigment, dolphin LWS pigment, and coelacanth rhodopsin having S292A substitutions that red-shifted pigment absorption by 8–28 nm (12Sun H.

In addition, substitutions of Ile, Ser, Ala, or Thr at this site are also thought to play a role in rhodopsin spectral differences in both cottoid and deep sea fish species and have arisen multiple times within fish lineages (36Hunt D.M.

A focal point of this regulation is the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1. Recent work from Robert Blelloch's laboratory has sought to establish a mechanism to explain the observed role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in murine embryonic stem cell (mESC) biology (Wang et al., 2007Wang Y. Medvid R. Melton C. Jaenisch R. Blelloch R. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). In their most recent report, Wang et al., 2008Wang Y. Baskerville S. Shenoy A. Babiarz J.E. Baehner L. Blelloch R. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 1478-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar describe a role for mESC-specific miRNAs in establishing rapid cell division cycles. This topic has been on the radar screen of stem cell biologists for many years, but little is known about mechanisms underpinning the rapid division rates observed in mESCs, or what significance this short cell-cycle time may have in relation to their biology. The Blelloch study makes some important progress toward addressing some of these issues. mESCs exhibit extraordinary rates of proliferation, with generation times typically in the order of ∼10 hr (Burdon et al., 2002Burdon T. Smith A. Savatier P. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 432-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). The growth kinetics of mESCs are in close concordance with the short generation times observed in pluripotent epiblast cells in the peri-implantation mouse embryo (Snow, 1977Snow M.H.L. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1977; 42: 293-303Google Scholar). Rapid cell division therefore appears to be a general trait of embryo-derived pluripotent cells in the rodent. Rapid cell division is associated with an unusual cell-cycle structure, most notably the short length of G1 (∼2 hr) and the high percentage of cells in S phase (Burdon et al., 2002Burdon T. Smith A. Savatier P. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 432-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, Stead et al., 2002Stead E. White J. Faast R. Conn S. Goldstone S. Rathjen J. Dhingra U. Rathjen P. Walker D. Dalton S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8320-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). As mESCs differentiate, generation times increase (>18 hr) and the cell cycle is remodeled so that the length of G1 increases (Stead et al., 2002Stead E. White J. Faast R. Conn S. Goldstone S. Rathjen J. Dhingra U. Rathjen P. Walker D. Dalton S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8320-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, White et al., 2005White J. Stead E. Faast R. Conn S. Cartwright P. Dalton S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2018-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this adjustment coincides with loss of tumorigenic potential and the activation of pathways that couple mitogenic signaling to the cell-cycle machinery (White et al., 2005White J. Stead E. Faast R. Conn S. Cartwright P. Dalton S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2018-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although human ESCs cycle more slowly (∼30–36 hr) than their rodent counterparts, ESCs of both species undergo similar cell-cycle remodeling during differentiation, in that the proportion of cells in G1 increases with the loss of pluripotency (Ohtsuka and Dalton, 2008Ohtsuka S. Dalton S. Gene Ther. 2008; 15: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The biological significance of these observations has yet to be fully elucidated, but several major questions emerge from these early studies. First, what is the molecular mechanism underpinning rapid cell division in pluripotent cells? Second, what is the biological significance of rapid embryonic division, and does it have a role in the establishment and/or maintenance of pluripotency? Finally, is rapid cell division by ESCs required for the pluripotent cells to eventually enter a normal differentiation program? The first question was addressed some time ago by Stead and coworkers, who established that many of the basic rules of somatic cell division cycle control do not apply in mESCs. To appreciate this issue, it is important to remember that transition through the cell cycle is controlled by the activity of phase-specific cyclin-dependent protein kinases (Cdks). These kinases are activated and inactivated at precise points of the cell cycle and phosphorylate substrates required for the different cell-cycle transitions. The periodicity of Cdk activity is critical for the normal sequence of events that occur during a typical somatic cell cycle. In mESCs, Cdk2, which controls G1 progression into S phase, displays elevated activity throughout the cell cycle and shows no obvious periodicity (Stead et al., 2002Stead E. White J. Faast R. Conn S. Goldstone S. Rathjen J. Dhingra U. Rathjen P. Walker D. Dalton S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8320-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, White et al., 2005White J. Stead E. Faast R. Conn S. Cartwright P. Dalton S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2018-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As pluripotent cells begin to differentiate, Cdk2 activity declines and becomes cell cycle regulated, explaining the G1 phase expansion observed during cell-cycle remodeling (Figure 1). Mechanistically, decreased Cdk2 activity can be accounted for by the collapse in levels of cyclin E and cyclin A, two of its regulatory subunits, but also by increased levels of the Cdk inhibitors p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 (Stead et al., 2002Stead E. White J. Faast R. Conn S. Goldstone S. Rathjen J. Dhingra U. Rathjen P. Walker D. Dalton S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8320-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, White et al., 2005White J. Stead E. Faast R. Conn S. Cartwright P. Dalton S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2018-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) (Figure 1). Many laboratories have attempted to elucidate the upstream events associated with the elevated Cdk activity observed in mESCs, but little progress has been made thus far. Now, some important insights into this question have been gleaned from recent observations made by the Blelloch laboratory, who investigated the role of an RNA-binding protein, Dcgr3, that performs an essential role in the biogenesis of canonical miRNAs. Genetic deletion of Dcgr3 in mESCs interferes with miRNA biogenesis and promotes the accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (Wang et al., 2008Wang Y. Baskerville S. Shenoy A.

These findings lead directly to the hypothesis that miRNAs may influence the G1-S transition by regulating Cdk activity. To identify individual miRNAs that function during G1-S progression, a screen was performed in which 266 canonical miRNAs were introduced into Dcgr3-deficient mESCs. Fourteen of the miRNAs tested rescued the Dcgr3-associated proliferation defect, as indicated by a shortening of the G1 phase. Several of these 14 hits, including those comprising the mir-290 cluster, are expressed specifically in mESCs and are downregulated upon differentiation. Based on their observed function in mESCs, this group of miRNAs was collectively designated “ES-cell-specific cell-cycle-regulating” (ESCC) miRNAs. This cohort of miRNAs are functionally redundant and contain a related “seed” sequence, indicating that they target overlapping downstream RNA targets for translational repression. A computational survey of potential ESCC miRNA targets identified the Cdk2 inhibitor p21Cip1 (Cdkn1a) as being of special interest because of its link to proliferative control and Cdk regulation. A link between ESCC miRNAs and p21Cip1 was established by demonstrating that ESCC miRNAs suppress p21Cip1 protein levels and regulate the Cdkn1a transcript through its 3′ untranslated region, consistent with classic miRNA-mediated translational inhibition. Moreover, overexpression of p21Cip1 in mESCs was sufficient to reproduce the G1-S delay previously described in a Dcgr3-deficient background. Additional cell-cycle target genes such as Rb1, Rbl1, Rbl2, and Lats2 were also shown to be targeted by this regulatory pathway. These results suggest that miRNAs can modulate the G1-S transition by restraining the ability of p21Cip1 to inhibit Cdk2-cyclin E complexes (Figure 1). Since the mir-290 cluster is expressed at high levels in mESCs and downregulated early during differentiation, members of this ESCC subset are likely to be the key regulators of p21Cip1 in the pluripotent state. Other miRNAs identified in the original screen by Wang et al. may play roles in other cell types that exhibit rapid cell cycles. Cells of the intestinal crypt and activated T cells, for example, also have short generation times and could be subject to a control mechanism similar to that described by Wang et al. in early development. It will also be important to establish if tumor cells express any of the 14 miRNAs identified by the Blelloch studies and to then establish if the ESCCs participate in the deregulation of cancer cell growth. The ability to generate rapidly dividing subpopulations of tumor cells would provide a powerful selective advantage and could thus lead to rapid amplification of the disregulated cells. In the context of pluripotent cell biology, the role of ESCC miRNAs remains only partially defined. That is, although Dcgr3 is required for normal proliferation and differentiation, ESCC miRNAs themselves have only been investigated in the context of cell-cycle control, and not for effects on long-term self-renewal or differentiation potential. Observations made in Dcgr3-deficient mESCs raise the possibility that rapid cell division is functionally linked to the molecular program responsible for initiation of differentiation. However, Wang et al. comment that ESCC miRNAs do not rescue the differentiation defect in Dcgr3 cells. This observation suggests that additional miRNAs outside the mir-290 cluster lie downstream of Dcgr3. In summary, the Blelloch studies have exposed a previously hidden dimension of cell-cycle control in mESCs that should ultimately point the way toward a better understanding of basic pluripotent cell biology and differentiation mechanics."

We sought to determine the effect of volume and teaching status on patient outcomes for five gynecologic malignancies: endometrial, cervical, ovarian and vulvar carcinoma and uterine sarcoma.The Florida Cancer Data System dataset was queried for all patients undergoing treatment for gynecologic cancers from 1990-2000.Overall, 48,981 patients with gynecologic malignancies were identified. Endometrial tumors were the most common, representing 43.2% of the entire cohort, followed by ovarian cancer (30.9%), cervical cancer (20.8%), vulvar cancer (4.6%), and uterine sarcoma (0.5%). By univariate analysis, although patients treated at high volume centers (HVC) were significantly younger, they benefited from an improved short-term (30-day and/or 90-day) survival for cervical, ovarian and endometrial cancers. Multivariate analysis (MVA), however, failed to demonstrate significant survival benefit for gynecologic cancer patients treated at teaching facilities (TF) or HVC. Significant prognostic factors at presentation by MVA were age over 65 (HR = 2.6, p<0.01), African-American race (HR = 1.36, p<0.01), and advanced stage (regional HR = 2.08, p<0.01; advanced HR = 3.82, p<0.01, respectively). Surgery and use of chemotherapy were each significantly associated with improved survival.No difference in patient survival was observed for any gynecologic malignancy based upon treating hospital teaching or volume status. Although instances of improved outcomes may occur, overall further regionalization would not appear to significantly improve patient survival."
https://openalex.org/W2005922512,"Although the Canadian health care system provides essential services to all residents, evidence suggests that socioeconomic gradients in disease outcomes still persist. The main objective of our study was to investigate whether mortality, from cardiovascular disease or other causes, varies by neighbourhood socioeconomic gradients in patients accessing the healthcare system for cardiovascular disease management.A cohort of 485 patients with angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and neighbourhood socioeconomic status information was followed for 13.3 years. Survival analyses were completed with adjustment for potentially confounding risk factors. There were 64 cases of cardiovascular mortality and 66 deaths from non-cardiovascular chronic diseases. No socioeconomic differentials in cardiovascular mortality were observed. However, lower neighbourhood employment, education, and median family income did predict an increased risk of mortality from non-cardiovascular chronic diseases. For each quintile decrease in neighbourhood socioeconomic status, non-cardiovascular mortality risk rose by 21-30%. Covariate-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for non-cardiovascular mortality were 1.21 (1.02-1.42), 1.21 (1.01-1.46), and 1.30 (1.06-1.60), for each quintile decrease in neighbourhood education, employment, and income, respectively. These patterns were primarily attributable to mortality from cancer. Estimated risks for mortality from cancer rose by 42% and 62% for each one quintile decrease in neighbourhood median income and employment rate, respectively. Although only baseline clinical information was collected and patient-level socioeconomic data were not available, our results suggest that environmental socioeconomic factors have a significant impact on CAD patient survival.Despite public health care access, CAD patients who reside in lower-socioeconomic neighbourhoods show increased vulnerability to non-cardiovascular chronic disease mortality, particularly in the domain of cancer. These findings prompt further research exploring mechanisms of neighbourhood effects on health, and ways they may be ameliorated."
https://openalex.org/W2069885909,"Background A replication defective influenza A vaccine virus (delNS1 virus) was developed. Its attenuation is due to potent stimulation of the innate immune system by the virus. Since the innate immune system can also target cancer cells, we reasoned that delNS1 virus induced immune-stimulation should also lead to the induction of innate cytotoxic effects towards cancer cells. Methodology/Principal Findings Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), isolated CD56+, CD3+, CD14+ and CD19+ subsets and different combinations of the above subsets were stimulated by delNS1, wild type (wt) virus or heat inactivated virus and co-cultured with tumor cell lines in the presence or absence of antibodies against the interferon system. Stimulation of PBMCs by the delNS1 virus effectively induced cytotoxicity against different cancer cell lines. Surprisingly, virus induced cytotoxicity was exerted by all major subtypes of PBMCs including CD56+, CD3+, CD14+ and CD19+ cells. Virus induced cytotoxicity in CD3+, CD14+ and CD19+ cells was dependent on virus replication, whereas virus induced cytotoxicity in CD56+ cells was only dependent on the binding of the virus. Virus induced cytotoxicity of isolated cell cultures of CD14+, CD19+ or CD56+ cells could be partially blocked by antibodies against type I and type II (IFN) interferon. In contrast, virus induced cytotoxicity in the complete PBMC preparation could not be inhibited by blocking type I or type II IFN, indicating a redundant system of activation in whole blood. Conclusions/Significance Our data suggest that apart from their well known specialized functions all main subsets of peripheral blood cells also initially exert a cytotoxic effect upon virus stimulation. This closely links the innate immune system to the adaptive immune response and renders delNS1 virus a potential therapeutic tool for viro-immunotherapy of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2010594340,"We have recently reported that plasmin likely associates with the factor VIII light chain to proteolyze at Lys36 within the A1 domain. In this study, we determined that the rate of plasmin-catalyzed inactivation on the forms of factor VIIIa containing A1-(1–336) and 1722A3C1C2, reflecting Lys36 cleavage, was reduced by ∼60%, compared with those containing 1649A3C1C2 and 1690A3C1C2. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that Lys36 cleavage of factor VIIIa with 1722A3C1C2 was markedly slower than those with 1649A3C1C2 and 1690A3C1C2. Surface plasmon resonance-based assays, using active site-modified anhydro-plasmin (Ah-plasmin) showed that 1722A3C1C2 bound to Ah-plasmin with an ∼3-fold lower affinity than 1649A3C1C2 or 1690A3C1C2 (Kd, 176, 68.2, and 60.3 nm, respectively). Recombinant A3 bound to Ah-plasmin (Kd, 44.2 nm), whereas C2 failed to bind, confirming the presence of a plasmin-binding site within N terminus of A3. Furthermore, the Glu-Gly-Arg active site-modified factor IXa also blocked 1722A3C1C2 binding to Ah-plasmin by ∼95%, supporting the presence of another plasmin-binding site overlapping the factor IXa-binding site in A3. In keeping with a major contribution of the lysine-binding sites in plasmin for interaction with the factor VIII light chain, analysis of the A3 sequence revealed two regions involving clustered lysine residues in 1690–1705 and 1804–1818. Two peptides based on these regions blocked 1649A3C1C2 binding to Ah-plasmin by ∼60% and plasmin-catalyzed Lys36 cleavage of factor VIIIa with A1-(1–336) by ∼80%. Our findings indicate that an extended surface, centered on residues 1690–1705 and 1804–1818 within the A3 domain, contributes to a unique plasmin-interactive site that promotes plasmin docking during cofactor inactivation by cleavage at Lys36.

Factor VIII circulates as a complex with von Willebrand factor and functions as an essential cofactor in the tenase complex responsible for anionic phospholipid surface-dependent conversion of factor X to Xa by factor IXa (1Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular defects in factor VIII result in the congenital bleeding disorder, hemophilia A. Factor VIII is composed of 2,332 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of ∼300 kDa and contains three types of structural domain, arranged in the order of A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 (2Wood W.I. Capon D.J.

Mature factor VIII is processed to a series of metal ion-dependent heterodimers by cleavage at the B-A3 junction, generating a heavy chain consisting of the A1 and A2 domains, together with heterogeneous fragments of a partially proteolyzed B domain, linked to a light chain consisting of the A3, C1, and C2 domains (2Wood W.I.

Factor VIII is converted into an active form, factor VIIIa, by limited proteolysis catalyzed by either thrombin or factor Xa (5Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Cleavages at Arg372 and Arg740 in the heavy chain produce 50-kDa A1 and 40-kDa A2 subunits. Cleavage of the 80-kDa light chain (1649A3C1C2) at Arg1689 produces a 70-kDa A3C1C2 subunit (1690A3C1C2). Additional cleavage by factor Xa at Arg1721 produces a 67-kDa A3C1C2 subunit (1722A3C1C2). Proteolysis at Arg372 and Arg1689 is essential for generating factor VIIIa cofactor activity (6Fay P.J. Blood Rev. 2004; 18: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Cleavage at the former site exposes a functional factor IXa-interactive site within the A2 domain that is cryptic in the unactivated molecule (7Fay P.J. Mastri M. Koszelak M.E. Wakabayashi H. J.

In this study, we have expanded our studies using truncated light chain, recombinant factor VIII subunits, and synthetic peptides, and identified plasmin-interactive sites within the light chain responsible for cleavage at Lys36.

DNA fragments encoding the A3 domain were generated by PCR using pMT2/factor VIII as a template and a pair of corresponding primers. The amplified fragments were ligated with pET-20b(+) expression vectors. Plasmid DNA was purified, and the sequence was confirmed by direct sequencing in both directions using Applied Biosystems technology (Foster City, CA). The plasmid was used for transformation of Origami(DE3)pLysS E. coli cells (Novagen), the host strain for the protein expression. The protein was expressed and subsequently purified using a His-Select affinity cartridge (Sigma).

Smith C. Tait J. Fujikawa K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 89: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The rC2 protein was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and CM-Sepharose chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (31Takeshima K. Smith C. Tait J. Fujikawa K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 89: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of Factor VIIIa Form-The A1/A3C1C2 dimer was reconstituted by mixing 500 nm of A1 form (A1-(1–372), A1-(1–336), and A1-(37–336)) and an equimolar amount of A3C1C2 form (1649A3C1C2, 1690A3C1C2, and 1722A3C1C2) overnight at 4 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.3 m NaCl, 25 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Tween 20 (13Nogami K. Wakabayashi H. Schmidt K. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1634-1641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the reconstituted A1/A3C1C2 dimer forms (100 nm) were reacted with the excess amounts (300 nm) of A2 subunit for >15 min at 22 °C to minimize the A2 subunit dissociation from factor VIIIa. Reaction for >15 min generated the maximal factor VIIIa activity. Factor Xa Generation Assay-The rate of conversion of factor X to factor Xa was monitored in a purified system (13Nogami K. Wakabayashi H. Schmidt K. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1634-1641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Plasmin-catalyzed inactivation of factor VIIIa was performed in HBS buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Tween 20) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and phospholipid vesicles (10 μm). Samples were removed from the mixtures at the indicated times, and plasmin reaction was immediately quenched by the addition of 0.2 mm Pefabloc and dilution. All reactions were performed at 37 °C. Factor Xa generation was initiated by the addition of factor IXa (20 nm) and factor X (400 nm) in the presence of phospholipid (10 μm). The reaction was quenched by addition of EDTA (100 mm). Rates of factor Xa generation were determined at 405 nm using a microtiter plate reader after the addition of chromogenic substrate, S-2222 (0.46 mm final concentration). A control experiment showed that the presence of plasmin and Pefabloc in the diluted samples did not affect this assay (data not shown). Factor VIIIa activity was determined as the amount (in nanomoles) of factor Xa generated per min and converted into the amount (in nanomoles) of factor VIIIa. Experiments assessing the stability of factor VIIIa were performed in the absence of plasmin to determine the rates of factor VIIIa activity loss resulting from the A2 dissociation. At the concentrations employed, ∼5% loss of the initial activity was observed over a 20-min time course. Thus, for each time point in this experiment, including plasmin, the observed residual activity was corrected for the contribution of activity loss from the plasmin-independent mechanism. Cleavage of Factor VIIIa Forms by Plasmin-Human plasmin (4 nm) was added to the reconstituted factor VIIIa forms (100 nm) at 37 °C in HBS buffer containing phospholipid vesicles (10 μm). Samples were obtained at the indicated times, and the reactions were immediately terminated and prepared for PAGE by adding SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol and boiling for 3 min. Electrophoresis and Western Blotting-SDS-PAGE was performed using 8% gels by the procedure of Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was carried out at 150 V for 1 h. For Western blotting, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 50 V for 2 h in buffer containing 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, and 10% (v/v) methanol. Proteins were probed using anti-A1 mAb58.12, followed by goat anti-mouse peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (MP Biomedicals, Aurora, OH). The signals were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Kinetics Measurements Using Real Time Biomolecular Interaction Analysis-The kinetics of factor VIII light chain and plasmin interaction were determined by SPR-based assays using a BIAcore X instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) as reported previously (21Nogami K. Nishiya K. Saenko E.L. Takeyama M. Tanaka I. Yoshioka A. Shima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Ah-plasmin was covalently coupled (∼7 ng/mm2) to a CM5 sensor chip surface. Association of the ligand was monitored at a flow rate of 20 μl/min for 4 min. The dissociation of bound ligand was recorded over a 4-min period by replacing the ligand-containing buffer with buffer alone. The level of nonspecific binding corresponding to ligand binding to the uncoated chip was subtracted from the signal. The reactions were run at 37 °C. The rate constants for association (ka) and dissociation (kd) were determined by nonlinear regression analysis using the evaluation software provided by BIAcore AB. Equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated as kd/ka. ELISA Binding Assays Using Immobilized Ah-plasmin- These assays were performed as reported previously (21Nogami K. Nishiya K. Saenko E.L. Takeyama M. Tanaka I. Yoshioka A. Shima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, Ah-plasmin (200 nm) was coated onto microtiter wells overnight at 4 °C. The wells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C, and various concentrations of the A3C1C2 subunits were added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Biotinylated anti-C2 NMC-VIII/5 mAb IgG (1 μg) was added to each well, and bound IgG was detected by addition of horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin. The absorbance was measured at 492 nm with a Labsystems Multiskan Multisoft microplate reader (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). The amount of nonspecific binding of biotinylated IgG, observed in the absence of A3C1C2, was <5% of the total signal, and the amount of specific binding was obtained by subtracting the amount of nonspecific binding of biotinylated IgG. Data Analysis-All experiments were performed at least three separate times. The parameters and their standard errors are shown. Nonlinear least squares or linear regression analysis was performed by KaleidaGraph (Synergy Reading, PA). The rates of the slope of first several points (within 5 min) in the time course of the plasmin-catalyzed inactivation of factor VIIIa form were fitted to a straight line from linear regression, and the obtained values were expressed as the inactivation rate. All correlation values (r) were >0.99. Analyses of the interactions between the different forms of A3C1C2 and Ah-plasmin in ELISA were performed by a single-site binding model using Equation 1,A=Amax·[S]Kd+[S]Eq. 1 where [S] is the concentration of A3C1C2 form in the solid-phase binding assay; Kd is the dissociation constant; and Amax represents maximum absorbance signal when the site is saturated by the A3C1C2 form. Data from studies assessing the EGR-factor IXa or A3 synthetic peptide-dependent inhibition of plasmin interaction with A3C1C2 form were fitted by nonlinear least squares regression by using Equation 2,&percnt;binding=Bmax·[A3C1C2form]Kd·1+[L]Ki+[A3C1C2form]+CEq. 2 where L represents the concentration of EGR-factor IXa or A3 peptide; Bmax represents maximum binding; Kd is the dissociation constant for the interaction between the A3C1C2 form and Ah-plasmin; Ki is the apparent inhibition constant for L; and C is a constant for binding of the A3C1C2 form and Ah-plasmin that was unaffected by L. Plasmin-catalyzed Inactivation of Factor VIIIa Reconstituted with the A11–336 and Various A3C1C2 Forms-We have recently reported that plasmin appears to associate with the light chain of factor VIII to regulate the proteolytic cleavage at Lys36 within the A1 subunit by its protease (18Nogami K. Shima M. Matsumoto T. Nishiya K. Tanaka I. Yoshioka A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5287-5295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the light chain contributes to plasmin-catalyzed factor VIIIa inactivation because of Lys36 cleavage, we first examined the effect on plasmin-catalyzed inactivation of factor VIIIa forms reconstituted with various A3C1C2 forms. Intact A1-(1–372) subunit is proteolyzed at Arg336 and Lys36 by plasmin, and the former cleavage significantly contributes to the factor VIIIa inactivation (18Nogami K. Shima M. Matsumoto T. Nishiya K. Tanaka I. Yoshioka A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5287-5295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, the A1-(1–336) subunit was utilized instead of the A1-(1–372) to observe the effect of Lys36 cleavage alone. Factor VIIIa forms were reconstituted in two-step procedures. The A1-(1–336)/A3C1C2 dimer forms were prepared by reacting the equimolar concentrations (500 nm) of the A1-(1–336) and isolated A3C1C2 subunits (1649A3C1C2, 1690A3C1C2, and 1722A3C1C2) in the presence of Ca2+. The resultant dimers were diluted 5-fold and reacted with the A2 subunit (300 nm) to generate factor VIIIa heterotrimers. The A2 subunit was used at higher concentration to minimize its inactivation because of A2 dissociation from A1/A3C1C2 dimer. Inactivation of various factor VIIIa forms were then monitored over time in the presence of plasmin (1 nm) and phospholipid vesicles (10 μm) using a factor Xa generation assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” The presence of plasmin and Pefabloc in the diluted samples did not affect this assay (data not shown). These data are illustrated in Fig. 1 and Table 1.TABLE 1Rates of plasmin-catalyzed inactivation of factor VIIIa forms reconstituted with various A1 and A3C1C2 forms Inactivation of factor VIIIa forms was estimated by the rate obtained using the straight line fitting by the first several points (within 5 min) of the data shown in Fig. 1. Data points represent mean ± S.D. values of at least three separate experiments.A3C1C2 formA1 formA11–336A137–336Inactivation rates1649A3C1C27.8 ± 0.20.2 ± 0.041690A3C1C27.9 ± 0.40.2 ± 0.051722A3C1C23.4 ± 0.20.2 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab In the absence of plasmin, the maximal generated factor Xa obtained at saturable levels of reconstituted factor VIIIa with A1-(1–336) and the loss (decay) of its activity were similar (Vmax, ∼55 nm/min and ∼5% activity loss at 20 min, respectively), independent of various A3C1C2 forms (data not shown). The activity of factor VIIIa forms with 1649A3C1C2 subunit was rapidly reduced in a time-dependent manner by the addition of plasmin, similar to that of factor VIIIa with 1690A3C1C2, with similar inactivation rates. The reduced activity reached ∼55% of initial activity at 20 min. Of interest, slower inactivation of factor VIIIa with 1722A3C1C2 by plasmin was observed, compared with 1649A3C1C2 and 1690A3C1C2. The activity was reduced by ∼30% at 20 min, and the inactivation rate was ∼45% that observed with 1649A3C1C2 and 1690A3C1C2. These results suggested that the N terminus of the light chain might be associated with plasmin-catalyzed inactivation of factor VIIIa with A1-(1–336) mediated by cleavage at Lys36. To further examine that inactivation of factor VIIIa with A1-(1–336) subunit by plasmin attributed to Lys36 cleavage, we repeated the same experiments using factor VIIIa forms reconstituted with the A1-(37–336) subunit, deleting the A1-(1–36). Factor VIIIa forms with the A1-(37–336), and various A3C1C2 subunits were reconstituted by the same approach. Independent of A3C1C2 forms, the maximally generated factor Xa and the activity loss (decay) of factor VIIIa forms were similar (Vmax, ∼25 nm/min and ∼5% activity loss, respectively) in the absence of plasmin (data not shown). Three factor VIIIa forms with A1-(37–336) were, however, little inactivated (by ∼5%) by plasmin even at over a 20-min reaction (Fig. 1, inset). Inactivation rates were similar, supporting the vie"
https://openalex.org/W1997732108,"The magnitude and apparent complexity of the brain's connectivity have left explicit networks largely unexplored. As a result, the relationship between the organization of synaptic connections and how the brain processes information is poorly understood. A recently proposed retinal network that produces neural correlates of color vision is refined and extended here to a family of general logic circuits. For any combination of high and low activity in any set of neurons, one of the logic circuits can receive input from the neurons and activate a single output neuron whenever the input neurons have the given activity state. The strength of the output neuron's response is a measure of the difference between the smallest of the high inputs and the largest of the low inputs. The networks generate correlates of known psychophysical phenomena. These results follow directly from the most cost-effective architectures for specific logic circuits and the minimal cellular capabilities of excitation and inhibition. The networks function dynamically, making their operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. The networks show that well-known psychophysical phenomena do not require extraordinarily complex brain structures, and that a single network architecture can produce apparently disparate phenomena in different sensory systems."
https://openalex.org/W2023150600,"Background Injection of CD8 T cells primed against immunodominant minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA) such as H7a can eradicate leukemia and solid tumors. To understand why MiHA-targeted T cells have such a potent antitumor effect it is essential to evaluate their in vivo behavior. In the present work, we therefore addressed two specific questions: what is the proliferative dynamics of H7a-specifc T cells in tumors, and do H7a-specific T cells persist long-term after adoptive transfer? Methodology/Principal Findings By day 3 after adoptive transfer, we observed a selective infiltration of melanomas by anti-H7a T cells. Over the next five days, anti-H7a T cells expanded massively in the tumor but not in the spleen. Thus, by day 8 after injection, anti-H7a T cells in the tumor had undergone more cell divisions than those in the spleen. These data strongly suggest that anti-H7a T cells proliferate preferentially and extensively in the tumors. We also found that two host factors regulated long-term persistence of anti-H7a memory T cells: thymic function and expression of H7a by host cells. On day 100, anti-H7a memory T cells were abundant in euthymic H7a-negative (B10.H7b) mice, present in low numbers in thymectomized H7a-positive (B10) hosts, and undetectable in euthymic H7a-positive recipients. Conclusions/Significance Although in general the tumor environment is not propitious to T-cell invasion and expansion, the present work shows that this limitation may be overcome by adoptive transfer of primed CD8 T cells targeted to an immunodominant MiHA (here H7a). At least in some cases, prolonged persistence of adoptively transferred T cells may be valuable for prevention of late cancer relapse in adoptive hosts. Our findings therefore suggest that it may be advantageous to target MiHAs with a restricted tissue distribution in order to promote persistence of memory T cells and thereby minimize the risk of cancer recurrence."
