https://openalex.org/W2107312415,"In cells treated with brefeldin A (BFA), movement of newly synthesized membrane proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus was blocked. Surprisingly, the glycoproteins retained in the ER were rapidly processed by cis/medial Golgi enzymes but not by trans Golgi enzymes. An explanation for these observations was provided from morphological studies at both the light and electron microscopic levels using markers for the cis/medial and trans Golgi. They revealed a rapid and dramatic redistribution to the ER of components of the cis/medial but not the trans Golgi in response to treatment with BFA. Upon removal of BFA, the morphology of the Golgi apparatus was rapidly reestablished and proteins normally transported out of the ER were efficiently and rapidly sorted to their final destinations. These results suggest that BFA disrupts a dynamic membrane-recycling pathway between the ER and cis/medial Golgi, effectively blocking membrane transport out of but not back to the ER."
https://openalex.org/W1968917541,"We have examined the effect of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription on recombination between directly repeated sequences of the GAL10 gene in S. cerevisiae. Direct repeat recombination leading either to plasmid loss or conversion was examined in isogenic strains containing null mutations in the positive activator, GAL4, or the repressor, GAL80. A 15-fold increase in the rate of plasmid loss is observed in cells constitutively expressing the construct compared with cells that are not. Conversion events that retain the integrated plasmid are not stimulated by expression of the repeats. Northern analysis of strains containing plasmid inserts with various promoter mutations suggests that the stimulation in recombination is mediated by events initiating within the integrated plasmid sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2054941139,"Granuloma formation in the liver of mice infected with BCG coincides with local TNF synthesis. Injection of rabbit anti-TNF antibody, after 1 or 2 weeks of infection, dramatically interferes with the development of granulomas (both in number and size, large epithelioid cells failing to appear) and subsequent mycobacterial elimination. Furthermore, fully developed BCG granulomas, after 3 weeks of infection, rapidly regress after anti-TNF treatment. Antibody treatment also prevents or suppresses accumulation of TNF mRNA and protein, which resumes after disappearance of the antibody. Peritoneal macrophages exposed to TNF transiently accumulate TNF mRNA, and show an enhanced increase in TNF mRNA in response to gamma interferon. We propose that TNF released from macrophages in the microenvironment of developing granulomas is involved in a process of autoamplification: acting in an autocrine or paracrine way, it enhances its own synthesis and release, thus favoring further macrophage accumulation and differentiation leading to bacterial elimination."

https://openalex.org/W2162247704,"The E. coli minicell locus (minB) was shown to code for three gene products (MinC, MinD, and MinE) whose coordinate action is required for proper placement of the division spetum. Studies of the phenotypic effects of expression of the three genes, alone and in all possible combinations, indicated the following: cell poles contain potential division sites that will support additional septation events unless specifically inactivated; the minC and minD gene products act in concert to form a nonspecific inhibitor of septation that is capable of blocking cell division at all potential division sites; and the minE gene codes for a topological specificity factor that, in wild-type cells, prevents the division inhibitor from acting at internal division sites while permitting it to block septation at polar sites."
https://openalex.org/W2066520670,Facultative intracellular pathogens pose an important health problem because they circumvent a primary defense mechanism of the host: killing and degradation by professional phagocytic cells. A gene of the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimurium that is required for virulence and intracellular survival was identified and shown to have a role in resistance to defensins and possibly to other microbicidal mechanisms of the phagocyte. This gene may prove to be a regulatory element in the expression of virulence functions.
https://openalex.org/W2150018728,"The yeast SIR2 gene is involved in regulating nucleosome phasing and transcription in the mating type system. We have found that SIR2 also plays another important role in the cell. Specifically, in wild-type SIR2 strains recombination between the tandemly repeated ribosomal RNA genes is depressed. In sir2 mutants, both mitotic and meiotic intrachromosomal recombination increase 10- to 15-fold. In striking contrast to its effect on rDNA, the SIR2 gene does not affect intrachromosomal recombination between non-rDNA gene duplications. Furthermore, in the absence of the SIR2 gene product, rDNA acquires a partial dependency on recombination gene functions (RAD50 and RAD52) that are normally dispensable for exchange in the rDNA array. Thus, SIR2 may function in excluding the rDNA region from the general recombination system. Here we demonstrate that SIR2's effect is not restricted to controlling mating type expression, but rather that SIR2 functions in a more general way in the genome."

https://openalex.org/W2164937884,"Lymphocytes express cell surface molecules, termed homing receptors, that mediate their selective attachment to specialized high endothelial venules found within secondary lymphoid organs. Previous work has demonstrated that the adhesive interaction between lymphocytes and the endothelium of peripheral lymph nodes appears to involve a lectin-like activity. Moreover, MEL-14, a monoclonal antibody that blocks lymphocyte-peripheral lymph node binding and presumably recognizes the homing receptor mediating this adhesive interaction, appeared to detect the lectin-like receptor. In this paper we describe the cloning of a murine cDNA that encodes the antigen recognized by the MEL-14 antibody. Characterization of the cDNA encoding the putative mouse peripheral lymph node-specific homing receptor shows that it contains a lectin domain that appears to be involved in the binding of lymphocytes to peripheral lymph node endothelium, thus defining a new type of cellular adhesion molecule. This result supports a novel mechanism for the distribution of lymphocyte populations to various lymphoid organs."
https://openalex.org/W2087123471,"Primary and secondary protium-to-tritium (H/T) and deuterium-to-tritium (D/T) kinetic isotope effects for the catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde by yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (YADH) at 25 degrees Celsius have been determined. Previous studies showed that this reaction is nearly or fully rate limited by the hydrogen-transfer step. Semiclassical mass considerations that do not include tunneling effects would predict that kH/kT = (kD/kT)3.26, where kH, kD, and kT are the rate constants for the reaction of protium, deuterium, and tritium derivatives, respectively. Significant deviations from this relation have now been observed for both primary and especially secondary effects, such that experimental H/T ratios are much greater than those calculated from the above expression. These deviations also hold in the temperature range from 0 to 40 degrees Celsius. Such deviations were previously predicted to result from a reaction coordinate containing a significant contribution from hydrogen tunneling."
https://openalex.org/W2032525309,"TGF-alpha and EGF are structurally related factors that bind to and induce tyrosine autophosphorylation of a common receptor. Proteolytic cleavage of the transmembrane TGF-alpha precursor's external domain releases several TGF-alpha species. However, membrane-bound TGF-alpha forms remain on the surface of TGF-alpha-expressing cell lines. To evaluate the biological activity of these forms, we modified two cleavage sites in the TGF-alpha precursor coding sequence, making processing into the 50 amino acid TGF-alpha impossible. Overexpression of this cDNA in a receptor-negative cell line, partial purification, and N-terminal sequence analysis indicate the existence of two transmembrane TGF-alpha forms. These solubilized precursors induce tyrosine autophosphorylation of the EGF/TGF-alpha receptor in intact receptor-overexpressing cells, and anchorage-independent growth of NRK fibroblasts. Cell-cell contact between TGF-alpha precursor-overexpressing cells and cells expressing high numbers of receptors also resulted in receptor activation. These findings suggest a role for transmembrane TGF-alpha forms in intercellular interactions in proliferating tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2005915396,"Isolation of a clone encoding the mouse lymph node homing receptor reveals a deduced protein with an unusual protein mosaic architecture, containing a separate carbohydrate-binding (lectin) domain, an epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domain, and an extracellular precisely duplicated repeat unit, which preserves the motif seen in the homologous repeat structure of complement regulatory proteins and other proteins. The receptor molecule is potentially highly glycosylated, and contains an apparent transmembrane region. Analysis of messenger RNA transcripts reveals a predominantly lymphoid distribution in direct relation to the cell surface expression of the MEL-14 determinant, and the cDNA clone is shown to confer the MEL-14 epitope in heterologous cells. The many novel features, including ubiquitination, embodied in this single receptor molecule form the basis for numerous approaches to the study of cell-cell interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2002662104,Passage of proteins across membranes during export from their site of synthesis to their final destination is mediated by leader peptides that paradoxically exhibit a unity of function in spite of a diversity of sequence. These leader peptides act in at least two stages of the export process: at entry into the pathway and subsequently during translocation across the membrane. How selectivity is imposed on the system in the absence of a consensus among the sequences of leader peptides is the main issue discussed here.
https://openalex.org/W1983513503,"The structural gene for N-myristoyl transferase (NMT1) has been cloned from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The gene encodes a polypeptide of 455 amino acids (Mr = 52,837) that has no identifiable significant primary sequence homology with any protein in currently available databases. Overexpression of NMT activity was achieved by means of the yeast episomal plasmid YEp24 without obvious effects on growth kinetics, cell morphology, or acylprotein metabolic labeling patterns. Insertional mutagenesis of the NMT1 locus on yeast chromosome XII caused recessive lethality, indicating that this protein acyltransferase activity is necessary for vegetative cell growth."

https://openalex.org/W2129913504,"We have identified and sequenced the Pseudomonas OCT plasmid-encoded alkane hydroxylase gene (alkB) and its promoter. The transcription initiation site of the alkBAC mRNA was determined by nuclease SI mapping. A putative interaction site with RNA-polymerase was identified based on homology of the alk promoter with other Pseudomonas promoters. The alkB gene encodes a 401-amino acid polypeptide which, despite an unusual codon composition, can be expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas. The amino-terminal sequence of the purified cytoplasmic membrane alkane hydroxylase was determined and was found to be in agreement with the nucleotide sequence. The translation product of the alkB gene contains nine hydrophobic sequences of which eight are sufficiently long to be membrane-spanning segments. The amino-terminal sequence resembles that of several bacterial integral membrane proteins and is not cleaved off following translation."
https://openalex.org/W1566008126,"125I-Labeled recombinant human interleukin-3 (IL-3) was used to study the characteristics and distribution of receptors for IL-3 on human cells. Receptors were found on primary monocytes, on some strains of KG-1 cells, and on pre-B cell lines. Binding was rapid at 37 degrees C, while requiring several hours to reach equilibrium at 4 degrees C. Equilibrium binding studies indicated that IL-3 bound to a single class of high affinity receptor (less than 500 receptors/cell) with a Ka of approximately 1 x 10(10) M-1. Inhibition studies revealed that human granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor partially inhibited the binding of 125I-IL-3 to human monocytes but not JM-1 cells. Additional analysis showed that on KG-1 cells, both IL-3 and GM-CSF partially competed specific binding of heterologous radiolabeled ligand, with approximately equivalent capacities. This competition occurred at both 37 and 4 degrees C. These results suggest heterogeneity in the binding sites for IL-3 and GM-CSF in which a subset of receptors binds only IL-3, a subset only GM-CSF, and another subset can bind both, all with high affinity. Additional heterogeneity was suggested by equilibrium binding of 125I-IL-3 to KG-1 cells which revealed a biphasic Scatchard plot containing a low affinity component not observed on monocytes and JM-1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1580129210,"Abstract A multienzyme catalyzing the formation of delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine, the first free intermediate in penicillin biosynthesis, was detected in an assay measuring the formation of tripeptide from L-[U-14C]valine in the presence of L-alpha-aminoadipic acid, L-cysteine, ATP, Mg2+ ions, and dithioerythritol. Enzyme was extracted from dry mycelium using a buffer with a high glycerol concentration and thiol protective agent to stabilize enzyme activity. In five steps the enzyme was purified 118-fold. It catalyzed ATP-pyrophosphate exchange in dependence of all three constituent amino acids, and the enzyme could be amino-acylated with L-[14C]valine. The molecular weight of the protein both native (in gel filtration chromatography) and denatured (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) was about 220 kDa. These data suggest that delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetase consists of a single polypeptide chain and a multienzyme thiotemplate mechanism for the reaction sequence is postulated."
https://openalex.org/W1586146176,"Human blood monocytes secrete a number of cytokines following activation including two hematopoietic growth factors, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and monocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF). The genes for these two factors can be both coordinately and independently expressed. Treatment of monocytes with phorbol myristic acid or cycloheximide induces both genes, while lipopolysaccharide selectively and transiently induces G-CSF transcripts. Interleukin-3 or granulocyte/monocyte-colony stimulating factor selectively induce M-CSF transcripts. Using nuclear run-on transcription assays and Northern blot analysis of actinomycin D-treated cells to estimate mRNA half-life, we show that the induction of both genes is due to mRNA stabilization. In resting monocytes, the levels of transcripts for both G-CSF and M-CSF are very low. Following stimulation with phorbol myristic acid, cycloheximide, lipopolysaccharide, or interleukin-3 the estimated transcription rate of both genes does not increase. However, the half-life of M-CSF mRNA increases to approximately 2 h, whereas G-CSF mRNA half-life increases to as long as 4 h. Thus, the control of CSF gene expression in monocytes is likely to involve more than one post-transcriptional mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2111308531,"The Pseudomonas oleovorans alkBAC operon encodes seven proteins, of which at least three are involved in alkane hydroxylase (alkBA) and alkanol dehydrogenase (alkC) activities. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the 2.5-kilobase pair alkA region and analyzed the role of its translation products in alkane oxidation. The alkA region contains three coding sequences, encoding two related rubredoxins (alkF and alkG) of 14- and 18-kDa molecular mass and a 52-kDa aldehyde dehydrogenase (alkH). Deletion analysis indicated that neither the 14-kDa alkF gene product (rubredoxin 1) nor the amino-terminal part of the 18-kDa alkG gene product (rubredoxin 2) is required for alkane hydroxylase activity in vivo. The product of the alkH cistron restores growth of a P. oleovorans aldehyde dehydrogenase mutant on aliphatic alcohols and aldehydes. Its amino acid sequence shows considerable homology to previously characterized aldehyde dehydrogenases from mammalian and fungal origin. The nucleotide composition of the alk genes (47% G + C) differs considerably from the G + C content of the P. oleovorans genome suggesting that the alk regulon may originate from an unrelated organism."
https://openalex.org/W1503632486,"Fifty-two of the best characterized Escherichia coli promoters in the Hawley and McClure [1983) Nucleic Acids Res. 8, 2237–2255) listing were used to determine the distribution of information content in promoters and to describe the basic features underlying the existence of several different promoter spacing classes, which are defined by the number of bases separating the −35 and −10 regions. The contact regions at −35 and −10 do not, on the average, contain sufficient information to specify a promoter. The search for additional specifying bases led to two conclusions: 1) the consensus nucleotide sequence in the noncontact regions of a promoter appears to be distinct for each of the major promoter spacing classes; 2) promoters appear to contain a 15–20 base subset of the 40–50 additional optimal noncontact bases. This improved view of the extended consensus sequence allows the detection of a 10-base degenerate palindrome which may be the basic unit of promoter structure. Contiguous direct repeats of this sequence produce a sequence closely related to the consensus for the 18-base pair spacing class. This underlying structure is also evidenced in the 17- and 16-base pair spacing classes; however, the start points of the fourth and subsequent repetitions of the sequence element are moved one and two bases upstream, respectively, relative to their location in the 18-base pair spacing class. These consensus sequences, when viewed in a helical format, all present the opportunity for two alternative sets of a dyad repeat. The −35 region is common to both sets and is paired with an extended −10 region in one set and with a pseudo-10 region in the other. Possible implications of these arrangements are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1545662949,"Abstract In this communication, we demonstrate that adult mammalian brain neurons express transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha). We used the anti-TGF-alpha monoclonal antibody, MF9, to immunohistochemically localize TGF-alpha in human and rat brain. We found specific immunoreactivity in neurons throughout the brain which was not a result of cross-reactivity of MF9 with the neuropeptide, synenkephalin. Northern blot analysis of bovine and rat brain RNA using human and rat TGF-alpha cDNA probes, respectively, revealed a single 4.8-kilobase pair mRNA with approximately equal abundance in the bovine brainstem, cerebellum, hypothalamus, and cerebral cortex. Fetal rat brain had about 2-fold more TGF-alpha mRNA than did adult rat. The brain TGF-alpha cDNA was cloned from a human neonatal brainstem library. Four identical clones were isolated after screening 10(6) recombinant lambda gt11 phage. The sequence of the 894-base pair cDNA was virtually identical with the cDNA isolated from a human renal cell carcinoma. A single alanine codon was deleted in the brain cDNA at an exon-exon junction. The alanine deletion is within the amino-terminal region of the TGF-alpha precursor that is thought to be removed by proteolytic processing of the precursor to the mature growth factor. These studies indicate that the normal mammalian brain neurons express TGF-alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1563605533,"Abstract Three stable hybridoma cell lines producing monoclonal antibodies specific for human liver manganese superoxide dismutase were established, and one monoclonal antibody, PG 11, was chosen for immunochemical studies. Immunoblotting demonstrated that the monoclonal antibody binds exclusively to the manganese superoxide dismutase. Immunohistochemical studies indicated that the enzyme is localized in the matrix of human liver mitochondria. To localize antibody-binding epitope, synthetic peptides of the NH2-terminal (residues 1-16) and COOH-terminal (residues 182-189, 190-196, and 182-196) parts of the enzyme were synthesized, and then their effects on the binding were studied using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. All of the above COOH-terminal peptides inhibited the binding whereas the NH2-terminal ones did not, indicating that PG 11 recognizes several peptides of COOH termini of manganese superoxide dismutase. This is the first report of monoclonal antibodies against human manganese superoxide dismutase with a distinct epitope and of the immunocytochemical demonstration of manganese superoxide dismutase."
https://openalex.org/W1554937054,"Abstract The periplasmic histidine permease of Salmonella typhimurium has been reconstituted in inside-out vesicles (IOV) of Escherichia coli by disrupting the cells with a French press in the presence of a high concentration of the periplasmic histidine-binding protein, HisJ. Efflux from IOV, which is equivalent to uptake in whole cells, is induced by ATP. The reconstituted system depends on the presence of the membrane-bound permease proteins, HisQ, HisM, and HisP, and does not function if reconstitution is performed in the presence of a mutant HisJ protein, HisJ5625, that can bind histidine normally but can't interact properly with the membrane complex. Efflux is not induced by the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, supporting the contention that ATP hydrolysis is necessary. 8-Azido ATP inactivates IOV, indicating that the ATP effect occurs through the HisP protein, which has previously been shown to be modified by 8-azido ATP (Hobson, A., Weatherwax, R., and Ames, G.F.-L. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 81, 733-7337). The estimated Km of the vesicles for ATP is about 200 microM. Vanadate, an inhibitor of phosphohydrolase enzymes, inhibits ATP-induced efflux. We conclude that ATP is likely to be the proximal energy source for periplasmic permeases."
https://openalex.org/W1488316916,"Thermotropic structural transitions in rabbit skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin and subfragment-1 (S-1) have been quantitatively investigated by using nucleotide-induced UV difference spectroscopy. The magnitude of the adenylyl 5'-imidophosphate (AMP-PNP)-induced difference spectrum is temperature-dependent for both S-1 and heavy meromyosin (HMM). The transition observed here appears to be the same transition observed by 31P NMR of bound AMP-PNP (Shriver, J., and Sykes, B. D. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 2004-2012). The ADP-induced spectrum is temperature-independent, which differs from the 31P NMR data, indicating that the chromophore contributing to the difference spectrum resides in a domain distinct from the active site, at least when ADP is bound. Although the magnitudes of the AMP-PNP-induced spectra are equal in magnitude for S-1 and HMM on a globular head basis, the temperature dependence of the AMP-PNP induced difference spectrum for S-1 differs significantly from that of HMM. The van't Hoff enthalpy for the apparent two-state transition in S-1 is half that observed with HMM: 19 (+/- 7.5) kcal/mol for S-1 and 35 (+/- 5) kcal/mol for HMM. This indicates an additional cooperative interaction in HMM which is not present in S-1. Modification of SH1 results in the loss of the temperature dependence of the AMP-PNP-induced difference spectrum, and the resulting difference spectra appear identical to those induced by ADP."
https://openalex.org/W1566966348,"1H and 31P NMR spectroscopies have been used to examine the effects of limited proteolysis with subtilisin Carlsberg on the global conformation of ovalbumin and on the local environment of phosphoserine 344, a residue two positions removed from the site of proteolysis. Such limited proteolysis has been shown to result in excision of a hexapeptide from the region of the protein that, in other serine protease inhibitors (serpins), contains the reactive center. Based on the structure of the related serpin alpha 1-antitrypsin, it has been predicted that phosphoserine 344 should undergo a large change in environment upon proteolysis of ovalbumin (Lobermann, H., Tokuoka, R., Deisenhofer, J., and Huber, R. (1984) J. Mol. Biol. 177, 531-550). Proteolysis of ovalbumin produces a small upfield shift (0.15 ppm) of the 31P resonance of phosphoserine 344. In addition, the pKa of phosphoserine 344 is raised by 0.1 pH unit. At pH 8.5, phosphoserine 344 in cleaved ovalbumin (plakalbumin) is as accessible to hydrolysis by Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase as it is in native ovalbumin. 1H NMR shows that dephosphorylation of serine 344 has an imperceptible effect on the protein's conformation. Similarly, little effect on conformation is seen by 1H NMR upon proteolysis of ovalbumin. These findings suggest that ovalbumin does not undergo a marked conformational change analogous to that inferred for the related members of the serpin superfamily, alpha 1-antitrypsin and antithrombin III, nor do the residues close to the site of proteolysis appear to change environment from that of an exposed loop to a buried strand of beta-sheet. These findings are not consistent with the hypothesis of Carrell and Owen ((1985) Nature 317, 730-732) for the role of the exposed loop in serpins of directly facilitating conformational change upon cleavage of the loop. Instead, it is proposed that cleavage of the exposed loop alters the solvent accessibility of residues formerly covered by the loop and that this provides the thermodynamic impetus for conformational change, perhaps by disruption of a salt bridge crucial to the integrity of the native structure."
https://openalex.org/W1517896181,"Two different Trypanosoma cruzi polypeptides, with masses of 70 and 68 kDa were purified and characterized in this work. These two polypeptides designated PAR 1 and PAR 2, respectively, co-purified during each step of the isolation procedure and were found to be located exclusively in T. cruzi flagella by indirect immunofluorescence. A pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopy procedure, with a gold-tagged secondary antibody, permitted direct identification of PAR 2 as a component of the T. cruzi paraflagellar rod. PAR 1 and PAR 2 were found to be immunologically distinct and showed no cross-reactivity with actin, tubulin, intermediate filament proteins, or other proteins present in mammalian cells. The results presented indicate that PAR 1 and PAR 2 are the major components of T. cruzi paraflagellar filaments, and that these filaments have no counterpart in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1677447939,"A computer search protocol for finding Escherichia coli bacterial and phage promoters is presented. This protocol relies heavily on the description of promoter sites developed in the preceding paper (O'Neill, M. C. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 5522-5530), with particular emphasis on the existence of a distinct consensus sequence for each of the three major spacing classes. The input sequence is tested independently for promoters with 16, 17, or 18 bases separating the -35 and -10 regions. Within a given spacing group, a series of six tests is employed to define possible promoters. These tests were developed empirically to identify members of the known promoter database with high efficiency while producing a minimal level of false positives. The degree to which this aim is met is discussed in the context of searches of random sequence, of pBR322, and of lambda."
https://openalex.org/W1515470832,"Based on the previous findings that the FokI methylase (MFokI) consists of 647 amino acid residues and contains two copies of the segment specific for adenine methylase, Asp-Pro-Pro-Tyr, at amino acid positions 218–221 and 548–551, the role of these copies in the methylation reaction was investigated by introduction of a mutation into each segment. The MFokI gene was inserted into M13 vectors, and the Asp residues in the two segments were converted to Gly and Ala by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The wild-type and mutant genes were recloned into an expression vector, from which gene products were purified. A short DNA fragment carrying the FokI recognition site was treated with each of these enzymes, and after separation of the two strands by duplex formation with M13 viral DNAs carrying the respective strands, the presence or absence of modification was judged from susceptibility to FokI endonuclease. The results of analysis showed that different strands were modified in an asymmetric way by the introduction of mutations into one of the two segments, and that the segments at the N-terminal and C-terminal moieties participated in modification of the strands carrying 5′-GGATG-3′ and 3′-CCTAC-5′, respectively. We concluded that MFokI contained two functional domains each of which was responsible for modification of different strands in the target DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1972139613,"The RecA protein from E. coli gains access to duplex DNA, by nucleation from a short single-stranded gap, to form a spiral nucleoprotein filament that is capable of interaction with homologous duplex DNA. The observations described here demonstrate that any part of the nucleoprotein filament, whether it contains single- or double-stranded DNA, is capable of pairing with homologous duplex DNA. Homologous contacts between regions of duplex DNA lead to an increase in the initial rate and final extent of joint molecule formation. The experiments indicate that pairing is facilitated by the formation of nascent synaptic intermediates between duplex DNA sequences. Using chimeric form I DNA, which is incapable of forming an inter-wound or plectonemic joint with the gapped DNA due to the presence of flanking heterologous sequences, we show that these duplex-duplex pairing reactions involve extensive underwinding of the double helix."
https://openalex.org/W1586168898,"The presence of acid proteases in the endosomal compartment of macrophages has been recently demonstrated (Diment, S., Leech, M. S., and Stahl, P. D. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6901-6907). This proteolytic activity allows the early degradation of ligands internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. To study the early steps that initiate the proteolytic processing of ligands, immune complexes formed with anti-dinitrophenol monoclonal IgG and radiolabeled dinitrophenol-derivatized bovine serum albumin were bound at 4 degrees C to Fc receptors of J774 macrophages. Cells were allowed to internalize immune complexes bound to the plasma membrane for different periods of time at 37 degrees C. Vesicle preparations generated from these cells were incubated in vitro at acidic pH to allow the hydrolysis of ligands located in protease-positive compartments. Ligand hydrolysis was observed after about 5 min of internalization, suggesting that at earlier times immune complexes were located in protease-free vesicles. Upon incubation of cell lysates under conditions that support in vitro endosome-endosome fusion, early protease-free endosomes containing ligand acquire proteolytic activity. Reconstitution of fusion-dependent proteolysis required energy, ions, membrane-associated factors, and cytosol. Cytosol was inactivated by incubation with N-ethylmaleimide. The proteolytic compartment formed upon in vitro incubation colocalized with endosomes in the light region of a Percoll gradient. Reconstitution was also achieved using an endosomal preparation separated from lysosomes in a Percoll gradient. Our results indicate that a fusion step between newly formed endocytic vesicles and a light density, protease-positive compartment triggers the proteolytic processing of ligands internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2146193446,"Abstract A gene encoding a 113-amino acid, NH2-terminal fragment of CD4, rsT4.113, was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of the tryptophan operon promoter. Following induction, rsT4.113 is produced at 5-10% of total E. coli protein, and it is found in inclusion bodies. The protein is purified in two steps under denaturing and reducing conditions. Solubilized rsT4.113 is first purified on a column of Q-Sepharose to remove low molecular weight contaminants and then purified to greater than 95% homogeneity by gel filtration. Renaturation of rsT4.113 is achieved at approximately 20% yield by dilution and dialysis. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of renatured rsT4.113 reveals a less than 15% contaminant of reduced protein. Purified and renatured rsT4.113 contains epitopes for both OKT4a and Leu3a, anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies which block CD4-gp 120 association, but lacks measurable affinity toward a nonblocking anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody, OKT4. By comparison to a longer form (375 amino acids) of recombinant soluble T4 produced in mammalian cells that contains the entire extracellular domain, rsT4.113 has a comparable affinity for binding to OKT4a and Leu3a in a radioimmunoassay. Analysis of antiviral activity of rsT4.113 demonstrates that the E. coli-derived protein inhibits human immunodeficiency virus-induced syncytium formation with an IC50 of 5-10 micrograms/ml. These data demonstrate that the human immunodeficiency virus-binding domain of CD4 is localized within the NH2-terminal 113 amino acids of CD4 and is contained within a structure homologous to the kappa variable-like domain of immunoglobulins."

Preferential hemimethylation took place at positions 3042 and 349. It was found that these preferential methylations were the same in supercoiled circular and linear DNAs. The flanking regions of these preferentially methylated sites contain three G.C pairs on one side and two A.T pairs and one G.C pair on the other. This preferential methylation was confirmed on a 126-base pair oligonucleotide containing two GATC sites with different flanking sequences. The next sites methylated were, in both cases, the first GATC site on the A.T-rich side, although the orientation was different. The rapid methylation of a second and third neighboring GATC site on the same plasmid suggests a processive mechanism. The implications of the orientation of hemimethylation are discussed in the context of the recognition of a palindromic target site by a monomeric DNA-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1512618923,"Abstract The three-dimensional structure of yeast enolase has been determined by the multiple isomorphous replacement method followed by the solvent flattening technique. A polypeptide model, corresponding with the known amino acid sequence, has been fitted to the electron density map. Crystallographic restrained least-squares refinement of the model without solvent gave R = 20.0% for 6-2.25-A resolution with good geometry. A model with 182 water molecules and 1 sulfate which is still being refined has presently R = 17.0%. The molecule is a dimer with subunits related by 2-fold crystallographic symmetry. The subunit has dimensions 60 X 55 X 45 A and is built from two domains. The smaller N-terminal domain has an alpha + beta structure based on a three-stranded antiparallel meander and four helices. The main domain is an 8-fold beta + alpha-barrel. The enolase barrel is, however, different from the triose phosphate isomerase barrel; its topology is beta beta alpha alpha (beta alpha)6 rather than (beta alpha)8 as found in triose phosphate isomerase. The inner beta-barrel is not entirely parallel, the second strand is antiparallel to the other strands, and the direction of the first helix is also reversed with respect to the other helices. This supports the hypothesis that some enzymes evolved independently producing the stable structure of beta alpha barrels with either enolase or triose phosphate isomerase topology. The active site of enolase is located at the carboxylic end of the barrel. A fragment of the N-terminal domain and two long loops protruding from the barrel domain form a wide crevice leading to the active site region. Asp246, Glu295, and Asp320 are the ligands of the conformational cation. Other residues in the active site region are Glu168, Asp321, Lys345, and Lys396."
https://openalex.org/W1610825815,"We have investigated the protein-protein cross-links formed within the 50 S subunit of the Escherichia coli ribosome using 2-iminothiolane as the cross-linking reagent. The members of the cross-links have been identified by immunoblotting from one-dimensional and two-dimensional diagonal sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels using antisera specific for the individual ribosomal proteins. This method also allowed a quantitation of the yield of cross-linking for each cross-link. A total of 14 cross-links have been identified: L1-L33, L2-L9, L2-L9-L28, L3-L19, L9-L28, L13-L21, L14-L19, L16-L27, L17-L30, L17-L32, L19-L25, L20-L21, L22-L32, and L23-L34. Our results are compared with those of Traut and coworkers (Traut, R. R., Tewari, D. S., Sommer, A., Gavino, G. R., Olson, H. M., and Glitz, D. G. (1986) in Structure, Function and Genetics of Ribosomes (Hardesty, B. and Kramer, G., eds) pp. 286-308, Springer-Verlag, New York). Our cross-linking data allow us to propose the approximate locations of eight proteins of the 50 S ribosomal subunit that so far have not been localized by immunoelectron microscopy and they thus contribute considerably to our knowledge of ribosome structure."
https://openalex.org/W1579922682,"Three different pigment-binding proteins of the light-harvesting complex (LHC I) of maize photosystem I (PS I) have been isolated. Absorption and fluorescence excitation spectral analyses showed that each pigment-protein can transfer absorbed energy from its carotenoid and/or chlorophyll b components to chlorophyll alpha. Their apoproteins with apparent sizes of 24 (LHC Ia), 21 (LHC Ib), and 17 (LHC Ic) kDa have been purified to homogeneity. Differences in their pigment and amino acid compositions and in their reactions with antibodies demonstrate that the two smaller pigment-proteins are not proteolytically derived from the largest one. LHC Ib's apoprotein is particularly enriched in cysteine residues. None of the three apoproteins cross-reacted with antibodies raised against the major light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-protein of photosystem II (LHC IIb) or against the PS I core complex (CC I) subunits. Studies of the biogenesis of PS I during greening of etiolated plants showed that all of the CC I subunits accumulated to a detectable level prior to the appearance of the 17-kDa subunit of LHC I, the accumulation of which preceded those of the 24- and 21-kDa subunits of LHC I. In addition, subunit VI of CC I is shown to be differentially expressed in mesophyll and bundle sheath cells; a slightly larger form of it accumulates in mesophyll than in bundle sheath thylakoids during plastid development."
https://openalex.org/W1506267493,"Abstract Treatment of tRNA with diethyl pyrocarbonate or hydrazine prior to incubation with the enzyme ATP/CTP:tRNA nucleotidyltransferase and [alpha-32P]ATP results in exclusion of modified bases from labeled molecules. Purines modified with diethyl pyrocarbonate, which interfere with enzyme recognition, cluster at the corner of the tRNA molecule, where the D- and psi-loops are juxtaposed in all 15 tRNAs used in this study. When the enzyme is isolated from Escherichia coli, few other sites of interference are evident near the 3'-end; when the homologous enzyme from yeast is used, more exclusions are apparent near the 3'-end. Modification of uridines with hydrazine has no effect on interaction with the enzyme, except for one uridine near the 3'-end of tRNA(Gly). Interference of enzyme activity by modified bases can be overcome by longer incubation times or increased concentrations of enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1558622925,"Abstract Nascent polysome-associated type I procollagen pro-alpha-chains isolated from chick embryo tendon fibroblasts were examined for their proteinase resistance. The distribution of chain sizes and their proteinase resistance were also determined following chain elongation in an in vitro readout system in the absence of chain initiation factors. Chains were labeled with [14C]proline in the cells and with [3H]proline in the readout system. Differences in the ratios of 14C to 3H in the double-labeled nascent chains before and after chymotryptic digestion, determined by slicing and counting polyacrylamide gels after electrophoresis, permitted analysis of the relative stabilities of in vivo and in vitro elongated portions of the chains. In confirmation of earlier work, the polysome-bound nascent procollagen contained chymotrypsin, chymotrypsin plus trypsin, and pepsin-resistant alpha-chain size components. The readout system data showed that the full length chains produced in the cell were more resistant to digestion than the fully elongated readout-completed chains. The protease resistance of the chains was taken to indicate the registration of the chains prior to the induction of helix formation during the isolation procedure. These data support the model in which chain selection and folding are facilitated by the organization of the attachment of the ribosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum surface."
https://openalex.org/W1580518357,"Abstract Cellular retinol-binding protein type II (CRBP(II)) is a major protein in the small intestine, accounting for more than 1% of the soluble protein recovered from rat jejunal mucosa. Two forms of the protein, called CRBP(II)A and CRBP(II)B, were purified from rat small intestine using a three-column procedure. The two forms were present in equal abundance. The primary structures of CRBP(II)A and CRBP(II)B were determined using a combination of techniques including amino acid composition and sequence analyses, and fast atom bombardment and gas chromatography-electron impact mass spectrometry. The primary structures of both proteins were found to be identical, but they differed in their NH2-terminal processing. CRBP(II)B was acetylated at its NH2 terminus, while CRBP(II)A was not. The results also confirmed the amino acid sequence of CRBP(II)A that was deduced from the cDNA sequence by Li et al. (Li, E., Demmer, L. A., Sweetser, D. A., Ong, D. E., and Gordon, J. I. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 5770-5783). Antibodies capable of distinguishing between the two forms of CRBP(II) were used for immunohistochemical studies which indicated that the organ and cellular distributions of the two forms were identical. The 50% acetylation observed here in vivo fits the pattern predicted by recent in vitro studies which described the effect of NH2-terminal sequence on cotranslational NH2-terminal processing of cytosolic proteins (Boissel, J. P., Kasper, T. J., and Bunn, H. F. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8443-8449). Our results provide a basis for investigating the possibility of different roles of CRBP(II)A and CRBP(II)B within cells, as well as the importance of acetylation of the amino terminus for these biological functions."
https://openalex.org/W1587823835,"RNA polymerase requires one of a family of sigma subunits for specific promoter recognition and initiation. We have developed an in vitro method to define the RNA polymerase sigma subunit required by a promoter. Mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for either Escherichia coli sigma 70 or sigma 32 or Salmonella typhimurium sigma 54 were added to an E. coli coupled transcription-translation S-30 extract programed with a DNA template containing the promoter of interest. Using the representative lacUV5, glnAP2, and rpoDHS promoters as controls, we found that monoclonal antibodies to a given sigma subunit strongly inhibited transcription from cognate promoters which utilized that sigma subunit, but had little effect on transcription from noncognate promoters which used other sigma subunits. Supplementation of the S-30 extract with purified sigma 70, sigma 54, or RNA polymerase sigma 32-holoenzyme stimulated expression from the cognate promoters and inhibited noncognate promoters. These two tests, addition of monoclonal antibodies and addition of sigma subunits, provide a rapid means of identifying whether the sigma subunit required by any promoter expressed in the S-30 extract is sigma 70, sigma 54, or sigma 32. We suggest that this method may provide a systematic approach for identifying promoters which use as yet uncharacterized sigma subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1513909293,"35 S rRNA is the major intracellular precursor to 18, 5.8, and 25 S rRNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this report, we show that the 3' termini of 35 S rRNA as well as 25 S rRNA are generated by post-transcriptional RNA processing rather than transcription termination. Using a partially purified yeast whole cell extract, efficient site-specific cleavage of a synthetic rRNA precursor was demonstrated in vitro. The 3' termini of the processed precursor were established by S1 nuclease protection analysis. RNA molecules containing the mature 3' termini of 35 and 25 S rRNA as well as molecules with a 3' terminus located 12 nucleotides beyond the 3' terminus of 25 S rRNA were the major products of the in vitro processing reaction. Processing activity required Mg2+ but was independent of ribonucleotides. Pretreatment of the yeast whole cell extract with proteinase K abolished processing activity, whereas micrococcal nuclease pretreatment of the extract had no effect on processing activity. These results show that RNA polymerase I-dependent transcription of yeast ribosomal cistrons continues beyond sequences that encode the 3' terminus of 35 S rRNA into the spacer region that separates 35 S rRNA transcription units."

https://openalex.org/W1498278017,"The specific activity of 2,3-dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase in homogenates of protease-treated seminiferous tubules, enriched spermatogenic cells, and Sertoli cells changed as a function of the age of prepuberal rats. The highest enzymatic activity occurred in each case in 23-day-old rats. Homogenates of pachytene spermatocytes, spermatids, or Sertoli cells had higher synthase activity than a whole testicular homogenate prepared by protease treatment of tubules. Enzymatic activity in pachytene spermatocytes expressed per mg of protein was about 1.7-fold higher than in spermatids, 5.3-fold higher than in spermatogonia, and about 8.3-fold higher than in spermatozoa. Therefore, the increase in spermatogenic cell synthase before day 23 can be accounted for by the appearance of the pachytene spermatocytes. Enzymatic activity decreased remarkably after the differentiation of spermatids into spermatozoa. Synthase activity in enriched Sertoli cell preparations was 1.5-2.3-fold higher than in spermatogenic cell preparations between days 15 and 30. Therefore, both spermatogenic cells and Sertoli cells contribute to changes in the enzymatic activity in seminiferous tubules during development. These changes may be important in regulating the availability of dolichyl phosphate for glycoprotein synthesis during early stages of differentiation."
