https://openalex.org/W2038763220,"IRE1 and PERK are type I transmembrane serine/threonine protein kinases that are activated by unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to signal adaptive responses. IRE1 is present in all eukaryotic cells and signals the unfolded protein response through its kinase and endoribonuclease activities. PERK signals phosphorylation of a translation initiation factor to inhibit protein synthesis in higher eukaryotic cells but is absent in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. The amino acid sequences of the amino-terminal ER luminal domains (NLDs) from IRE1 and PERK display limited homology and have diverged among species. In this study, we have demonstrated that the NLD of yeast Ire1p is required for signaling. However, the NLDs from human IRE1α and murine IRE1β and the Caenorhabditis elegans IRE1 and PERK function as replacements for the S. cerevisiae Ire1p-NLD to signal the unfolded protein response. Replacement of the Ire1p-NLD with a functional leucine zipper dimerization motif yielded a constitutively active kinase that surprisingly was further activated by ER stress. These results demonstrate that ER stress-induced dimerization of the NLD is sufficient for IRE1 and PERK activation and is conserved through evolution. We propose that ligand-independent activation of IRE1 and PERK permits homodimerization upon accumulation of unfolded proteins in the lumen of the ER.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ire1p has been implicated as the receptor that transmits the stress signal from the ER to the nucleus. Ire1p is a transmembrane Ser/Thr protein kinase/RNase with its amino-terminal domain residing in the ER lumen (NLD) and the kinase/RNase domain in the cytoplasm/nucleoplasm (1Cox J.S. Shamu C.E.

The accumulation of unfolded proteins initiates Ire1p oligomerization to induce autophosphorylation in trans with subsequent activation of the kinase/RNase activities (3Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. J.

Activated Ire1p functions as a site-specific RNase that cleaves at the 5′- and 3′-splice site junctions of HAC1 mRNA to initiate its splicing (5Sidrauski C. Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Spliced HAC1 mRNA encodes Hac1p, a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor that binds to the unfolded protein response element (UPRE) to activate the transcription of target genes. In S. cerevisiae, the UPRE is conserved in the promoters of all known UPR target genes including KAR2(encoding yeast BIP/GRP78), PDI1, and FKB2(6Lee A.S. Trends Biochem.

Considerably less is understood concerning the mechanism of UPR signaling in higher eukaryotes. Signaling is more complex in that both transcriptional and translational processes are regulated and survival and death responses are activated (9Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar). Two homologs,Ire1α and Ire1β, were recently identified in both murine and human genomes that both exhibit kinase/RNase activities and have a subcellular localization similar to that of yeast Ire1p (10Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 11Wang X.Z. Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Jolicoeur E.M. Kuroda M. Ron D.

Cell. 1999; 99: 691-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, an ER stress response element is necessary and sufficient for transcriptional induction of genes encoding protein chaperones such as BIP and GRP94 (13Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, a mammalian homolog of yeast HAC1 has not been identified. Recently, a gene encoding the ER-localized protein PEK/PERK was identified that has limited homology to Ire1p in the luminal domain. PERK is a protein kinase that is activated by ER stress to phosphorylate the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 on its α subunit (eIF2α) (15Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2533) Google Scholar, 16Shi Y. Vattem K.M. Sood R. An J. Liang J. Stramm L. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5723-5730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated eIF2α inhibits protein synthesis at the level of initiation, thereby limiting the amount of protein that requires folding. IRE1 and PERK are structurally similar to type I growth factor receptors that are activated by ligand-induced dimerization (18Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 459-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 19Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4611) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was proposed that ER stress generates a signal that is transduced through the NLD within the lumen to induce IRE1 and PERK kinase dimerization that will initiate downstream signaling (3Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18181-18187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 15Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D.

In support of this hypothesis, the Ire1p NLD was shown to oligomerize in S. cerevisiae (20Shamu C.E. Walter P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3028-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the functional role of the NLD in IRE1 and PERK for intracellular signaling from the ER to the nucleus by studying its function in yeast. Our results show that NLDs of IRE1 and PERK provide an evolutionarily conserved dimerization function that is necessary and sufficient to initiate signaling. Thus, we propose a ligand-independent negative regulatory model for the mechanism of IRE1 and PERK dimerization. The yeast strain AWY19 (W303–1A,UPRE CYC1 Leu2, UPRE CYC1 lacZ, Δire1) was used. 2A. A. Welihinda and R. J. Kaufman, unpublished data. Rat-Maf and rat-Jun cDNAs were obtained from Dr. Tom K. Kerppola (University of Michigan Medical School). Vent DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs) was used in all polymerase chain reactions, and all mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Tunicamycin (Tm) was obtained from Calbiochem. To construct pRS316-IRE1, a 4380-base pair fragment including 755 base pairs of the promoter sequence derived from pERN1GL (2Mori K. Ma W. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1993; 74: 743-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) was ligated into theHindIII site of pRS316 (21Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by standard techniques. In pRS316-IRE1-NLD193, NLD was deleted to the NheI site leaving a region that codes for 193 amino acids of the NLD. In NLD35, the NLD was deleted to the EcoRI site leaving a region that codes for 35 amino acids of the NLD. In pRS316-IRE1-BC, CGCACC (encoding Arg31-Thr32) was mutated to CGTACG (BsiWI site, encoding Arg31-Thr32), and CTAAAG (encoding Leu496-Lys497) was mutated to CTTAAG (AflII site, encoding Ile496-Lys497). In pRS316-IRE1-AD, TCCATC (encoding Ser20-Ile21) was mutated to TCCGGA (AccIII site, encoding Ser20-Gly21), and CTACTGAA (encoding Leu528-Leu529-Lys530) was mutated to TTAATTAA (PacI site, encoding Leu528-Ile529-Lys530). The functionality of AD and BC was shown in Δire1 cells to be identical to IRE1 (WT). Site-directed mutagenesis (22Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) was performed to generate all the point or double mutations in the NLD and pRS316-IRE1-K1058A (RNase-inactive mutant). The overlapping 1.3-kilobase polymerase chain reaction product containing NLD mutation(s) was cloned into BsiWI/AflII sites of BC. The cDNAs of hIRE1α (10Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5708-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), ceIRE1, and cePERK 3C. Y. Liu and R. J. Kaufman, unpublished data. were used as templates for amplification of each NLD. The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into AccIII/PacI sites of AD to replace the entire IRE1-NLD. The leucine zipper dimerization motifs amplified from rat Maf (23Sakai M. Imaki J. Yoshida K. Ogata A. Matsushima-Hibaya Y. Kuboki Y. Nishizawa M. Nishi S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and rat Jun cDNA (24Kitabayashi I. Saka F. Gachelin G. Yokoyama K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), respectively, were cloned into theBsiWI/AflII sites of BC to replace the respective Ire1p NLD fragment to make pRS316-IRE1-MafL and -JunL. In MafL(P), the first three leucine residues of MafL were mutated to proline residues. Yeast cells grown to mid-log phase were treated with Tm (2 μg/ml if not otherwise indicated), and samples were taken at indicated time points. Total RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis were performed according to standard protocols (25). The labeled probes of KAR2,HAC1, and the loading control pC4/2 were sequentially used in Northern hybridization (26Vidan S. Mitchell A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2688-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 27Welihinda A.A. Tirasophon W. Green S.R. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1967-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). mRNA abundance was quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and standardized to pC4/2. Cell lysates were prepared, and β-galactosidase activity was determined as described previously (27Welihinda A.A. Tirasophon W. Green S.R. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1967-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The same stimuli, the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen, activate both IRE1 and PERK. We reasoned therefore that the NLDs of both molecules may function in a common manner to sense ER stress and regulate kinase activity in vivo. Because the genome ofS. cerevisiae encodes only one ER stress-signaling molecule (Ire1p), we chose this model system to study the functional role of the NLD. Alignment of the NLD sequences of IRE1 and PERK proteins from divergent species identified only weak homology (6% identity/similarity with less than 12% homology overall) although 4 conserved motifs of about 12 identical amino acids could be aligned (Fig. 1). We examined the requirement of these limited numbers of identical residues by functional analysis in yeast that harbor a single copy of the lacZ gene under the control of the UPRE from KAR2. Expression of either WT Ire1p or the mutants containing alanine at residues Glu129, Trp144, Asp176, Pro192, Leu198/Ser202 (double mutation), Asp221, and Lys282/Thr283 (double mutation) was able to rescue Tm-dependent β-galactosidase induction in Δire1 cells (data not shown). In addition, mutation of the highly conserved and single N-glycosylation site (N298Q) that is utilized (2Mori K. Ma W. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1993; 74: 743-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) did not affect Tm-dependent β-galactosidase induction when compared with WT Ire1p (data not shown). These data support our observations that neither the highly conserved residues nor the N-linked glycosylation site within the NLD is required for IRE1 structure and/or function. To determine whether the NLD is required for UPR signaling, we analyzed two amino-terminal deletion mutants retaining the signal peptide and either 193 (with NLD193 in which most of the conserved residues were deleted) or 35 (NLD35) amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of the NLD (Fig. 2 A). WhereasIRE1 (WT) rescued the Δire1 phenotype monitored by β-galactosidase induction in response to Tm treatment, a mutant (IRE1-K1058A) that is defective in RNase activity did not restore induction (Fig. 2 B). In comparison, β-galactosidase induction in response to Tm treatment was significantly reduced with expression of NLD193 and completely abolished with expression of NLD35 (Fig. 2 B). Although we were unable to localize and quantify the mutant protein because of the low level expression of Ire1p (1Cox J.S. Shamu C.E. Walter P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 2Mori K. Ma W. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1993; 74: 743-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), the results suggest that the NLD is required for Ire1p function. To elucidate whether the NLDs of IRE1 and PERK use a similar mechanism(s) for sensing ER stress, chimeric expression vectors were constructed so that the yeast Ire1p NLD was replaced by the NLD of hIRE1α, mIRE1β, ceIRE1, or cePERK while retaining the Ire1p signal peptide sequence (Fig. 2 A). All four of the resultant chimeric NLDs were able to restore the UPR in Δire1 cells, and similar levels of β-galactosidase activity were observed within 3–4 h after Tm treatment (Fig. 2,C and D). The Tm dose responses for ceIRE1-NLD and cePERK-NLD activation in yeast were strikingly similar although ceIRE1-NLD displayed a higher basal activity (Fig. 2 F). These results support the observation that both ceIRE1 and cePERK utilize a similar sensing mechanism for activation, which responds to the same level of unfolded proteins in the ER. To determine whether dimerization is sufficient for Ire1p activation, we generated IRE1-MafL and -JunL, in which the NLD was replaced by a leucine zipper dimerization motif from the bZIP-containing transcription factors Maf and Jun (Fig. 2 A) (28Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 675-684PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, expression of these chimeras was able to activate β-galactosidase expression in the absence of Tm (Fig. 2 E). However, β-galactosidase expression was induced by Tm to similar levels in yeast that express WT Ire1p (Fig. 2, B andE). Substitution of one or two leucine residues within the leucine zipper with proline reduces dimer formation (29Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 71-79Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The Tm-induced β-galactosidase activity required the dimerization function of MafL because mutation of the first three leucine residues to prolines (IRE1-MafL(P)) abolished UPR induction (Fig.2 E). These results support the finding that Ire1p dimerization is necessary and sufficient to initiate Ire1p activation. To extend the analysis from the reporter gene experiments, Northern blot analysis of KAR2 induction and HAC1 splicing were performed. Upon Tm treatment, induction of KAR2transcription and HAC1 mRNA splicing was defective in Δire1 cells compared with cells expressing WT Ire1p (Fig.3 A). Δire cells expressing NLD193 and NLD35 showed significantly reducedKAR2 induction and HAC1 mRNA splicing. Cells that express the chimeric proteins containing the NLD from hIRE1α, mIRE1β, ceIRE1, cePERK, or MafL induced KAR2 transcription and HAC1 mRNA splicing with Tm treatment. Consistent with the β-galactosidase assay, the basal levels of KAR2expression were elevated for hIRE1α, ceIRE1, and MafL when compared with WT Ire1p, K1058A, mIRE1β, and cePERK. If the NLD requirement for Ire1p function is physiologically significant, cells deficient in NLD function should be sensitive to ER stress. To investigate this hypothesis, yeast cells were grown on plates containing different concentrations of Tm (Fig.3 B). In the absence of Tm, all the tested strains displayed growth rates similar or identical to WT and Δire1 cells. Under the same growth condition, a low concentration of Tm (0.25 μg/ml) severely impaired the growth of Δire1. Similarly, a low concentration of Tm dramatically reduced the growth of NLD193 and NLD35, which is consistent with β-galactosidase assay and Northern blot analysis. In contrast, Tm did not significantly affect the growth of hIRE1α-NLD, mIRE1β-NLD, ceIRE1-NLD, and cePERK-NLD when compared with WT Ire1p even though the observed growth rates were slightly different among the yeast expressing the four NLD-Ire1p chimeras. In the presence of Tm, the growth rates of Ire1p and MafL were comparable (Fig. 3 B) suggesting that the leucine zipper motif functions effectively to protect cells from ER stress. The growth of MafL(P) was significantly impaired at Tm concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5 μg/ml compared with Ire1p and MafL. However, MafL(P) survived Tm treatment better than NLD35. In addition, we also observed a residual UPR induction with MafL(P) (Fig. 2 D). These results suggest that the mutations in MafL(P) did not completely abolish dimer formation. All eukaryotic cells respond to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER by activation of transmembrane protein kinases that transmit the signal across the ER membrane. IRE1 and PERK mediate different downstream effects although both are activated by similar ER stresses (9Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, although S. cerevisiae does not have a Perk gene, replacement of the yeast Ire1p-NLD from cePERK was able to accurately signal the UPR. Therefore, NLD-mediated activation of IRE1 and PERK occurs through a common sensing mechanism that is conserved through evolution. In addition, dimerization of the NLD does not require gene products that are not expressed in S. cerevisiae such as presenillin-1 (12Niwa M. Sidrauski C. Kaufman R.J. Walter P. Cell. 1999; 99: 691-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) or GRP94 (30Argon Y. Simen B.B. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), which have been implicated in the UPR in higher eukaryotic cells. IRE1 dimerization may be regulated through one of two mechanisms (2Mori K. Ma W. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1993; 74: 743-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 8Chapman R.E. Sidrauski C. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 459-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar,9Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar). In a positive regulatory model, dimerization of IRE1 is activated by ligand binding to the NLD. The ligand could be unfolded protein itself, a complex between unfolded protein and a chaperone(s), or a yet unidentified ligand generated on ER stress. Because the NLDs of IRE1 and PERK are interchangeable, they should share a common ligand under this model. Replacement of the NLD with a bZIP motif from Maf or Jun constitutively activated Ire1p, which supports the requirement for dimerization. Surprisingly, this leucine zipper also conferred ER stress-dependent activation onto Ire1p similar to the WT Ire1p. It is unlikely that the bZIP motif would have specificity to bind an ER stress-induced ligand. An alternative model proposes that a negative effector maintains IRE1 as a monomer in the absence of ER stress. When unfolded proteins accumulate, they bind the negative regulator and release Ire1p for dimerization (Fig.4). What might function as a negative regulator of IRE1 and PERK dimerization? It is possible that structures such as the chaperone matrix of the lumen of the ER (31Zhang J.X. Braakman I. Matlack K.E. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1943-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) or the phospholipid bilayer itself may prohibit lateral diffusion to prevent dimerization. However, data indicate that BIP may prevent IRE1 and PERK dimerization. First, overexpression of BIP in yeast and in mammalian cells blocks activation of the UPR (32Kohno K. Normington K. Sambrook J.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) whereas reduction in BIP levels induces the UPR (5Sidrauski C. Cox J.S. Walter P.

Second, BIP binds to a broad spectrum of short hydrophobic polypeptides and interacts transiently with exposed hydrophobic patches on protein-folding intermediates as well as interactive surfaces on unassembled protein subunits of multisubunit protein complexes (37Flynn G.C. Pohl J. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 38Gething M-J. Semin. Cell Dev.

The leucine zipper motif may provide a hydrophobic surface, thereby explaining the ER stress induction of the bZIP-IRE1 chimeric molecules. Finally, the accumulation of properly or improperly folded mutant glycoproteins to which BIP does not bind does not induce the UPR (39Dorner A.J. Bole D.G. Kaufman R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 40Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol.

This suggests that only unfolded proteins that bind BIP are capable of competing with the NLD for BIP binding. In summary, our studies support a novel ligand-independent mechanism to induce IRE1 and PERK kinase dimerization. This mechanism may provide a paradigm for the mechanism of activation of additional protein kinases."

Although neuronal toxicity is a feature of late stages of AD, vascular pathology appears to be a feature of all stages of AD. Globular and nonfibrillar AbetaPs are continuously released during normal cellular metabolism, form calcium-permeable channels, and alter cellular calcium level. We used atomic force microscopy, laser confocal microscopy, and calcium imaging to examine the real-time and acute effects of fresh and globular AbetaP(1-42), AbetaP(1-40), and AbetaP(25-35) on cultured endothelial cells. AbetaPs induced morphological changes that were observed within minutes after AbetaP treatment and led to eventual cellular degeneration. Cellular morphological changes were most sensitive to AbetaP(1-42). AbetaP(1-42)-induced morphological changes were observed at nanomolar concentrations and were accompanied by an elevated cellular calcium level. Morphological changes were prevented by anti-AbetaP antibody, AbetaP-channel antagonist zinc, and the removal of extracellular calcium, but not by tachykinin neuropeptide, voltage-sensitive calcium channel blocker cadmium, or antioxidants DTT and Trolox. Thus, nanomolar fresh and globular AbetaP(1-42) induces rapid cellular degeneration by elevating intracellular calcium, most likely via calcium-permeable AbetaP channels and not by its interaction with membrane receptors or by activating oxidative pathways. Such rapid degeneration also suggests that the plaques, and especially fibrillar AbetaPs, may not have a direct causative role in AD pathogenic cascades."

In the presence of HBx, TGF-β-induced DNA laddering was decreased, indicating that HBx had the ability to block TGF-β-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, HBx did not alter the expression levels of type I and type II TGF-β receptors. HBx did not affect TGF-β-induced activation of promoter activities of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene. These results indicate that HBx interferes with only a subset of TGF-β activity. In the presence of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin or LY294002, the HBx-mediated inhibitory effect on TGF-β-induced apoptosis was alleviated. In addition, the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of the regulatory subunit p85 of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and PI 3-kinase activity were elevated in stable clones with HBx expression. Transactivation-deficient mutants of HBx lost their ability to inhibit TGF-β-induced apoptosis. Phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase and Akt, a downstream target of PI 3-kinase, was not observed in stable clones with transactivation-deficient HBx mutant's expression. Thus, the anti-apoptotic effect of HBx against TGF-β can be mediated through the activation of the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway, and the transactivation function of HBx is required for its anti-apoptosis activity.

Therefore, the pleiotropic activities of HBx are potentially relevant to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a potent inducer of apoptosis in hepatocytes and several hepatoma cell lines (24Lin J.-K. Chou C.-K. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 385-388PubMed Google Scholar, 25Oberhammer F.A. Pavelka M. Sharma S. Tiefenbacher R. Purchio A.F. Bursch W. Flermann R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

TGF-β exerts its action through transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors. These receptors propagate the signal by phosphorylating the intracellular targets, Smads. Phosphorylated Smad2 or Smad3 can form a stable complex with Smad4, which then translocates to the nucleus to regulate the transcriptional response to TGF-β (27Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar, 28Zhang Y. Derynck R. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 274-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) whereby TGF-β induces apoptosis is not fully characterized. Nevertheless, induction of oxidative stress (29Sanchez A. Alvarez A.M. Benito M. Fabregat I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7416-7422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), activation of caspase 3 (30Chen R.-H. Chang T.-Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 821-827PubMed Google Scholar), and inhibition of Rb expression (26Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1909-1919PubMed Google Scholar) have been implicated in mediating TGF-β-induced apoptosis. In liver cells, insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (31Tanaka S. Wands J.R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 391-394Google Scholar), as well as interleukin-6 (32Chen R.-H. Chang M.-C. Su Y.-H. Tsai Y.-T. Kuo M.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23013-23019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), all block TGF-β-induced apoptosis. Recent studies have revealed that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and its downstream target, Akt, are responsible for the anti-apoptotic activity of these factors against TGF-β (32Chen R.-H. Chang M.-C. Su Y.-H. Tsai Y.-T. Kuo M.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23013-23019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 33Chen R.-H. Su Y.-H. Chuang R.L.C. Chang T.-Y. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).To elucidate the correlation between the HBx gene and its response to apoptotic stimuli, the effect of HBx gene expression on TGF-β-induced apoptosis in the Hep 3B cell line was examined. Cells with constitutive or inducible expression of wild or mutant HBx were generated and tested. Transactivation-proficient HBx inhibited TGF-β-induced apoptosis. The PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway was involved in the HBx-mediated anti-apoptotic effect.DISCUSSIONThis study has demonstrated that HBx effectively suppresses TGF-β-induced apoptotic death of hepatoma cells. The HBx-mediated anti-apoptotic effect was not mediated through decreased expression of TGF-β receptors. Two specific inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, wortmannin and LY294002, blocked the anti-apoptotic effect of HBx, implying that HBx might affect the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway in mediating the effect. In cells expressing HBx, the PI 3-kinase activity and not its protein level was elevated. An increased phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 resulted. The anti-apoptotic mechanism of HBx was attributed, at least in part, to the activation of PI 3-kinase signaling cascades.The effects of HBx on cell death or apoptosis have been studied by several groups. p53-dependent apoptosis was prevented by microinjection of HBx into primary fibroblasts (18Wang X.W. Gibson M.K. Vermenlen W. Forrester K. Sturzbecher H.W. Hoeijmaker J.H.J. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6012-6016PubMed Google Scholar). Chirillo et al. (19Chirillo P. Pagano S. Natoli G. Puri P.L. Burgio U.L. Balsano C. Levrero M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8162-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) demonstrated that after DNA damage, HBx induced p53-dependent apoptosis in NIH3T3 cells transiently expressing HBx. In Chang liver cells, HBx failed to induce apoptosis; however, it did sensitize cells to apoptosis triggered by TNF-α (20Su F. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8744-8749Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Upon the induction of HBx expression mediated by theCre/loxP recombination system, liver cell apoptosis was observed independently of the p53 pathway (41Shintani Y. Yotsuyanangi H. Moriya K. Fujie H. Tsutsumi I. Kanegae Y. Kimura S. Saito I. Koike K. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3257-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The liver cells derived from a transgenic mouse were more susceptible to diverse apoptosis insults, and this phenomenon was not dependent upon p53 (42Terradillos O. Pollicino T. Lecoeur H. Tripodi M. Gougeon M.L. Tiollais P. Buendia M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2115-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These seemingly contradictory results of HBx on apoptotic events might be attributable to the utilization of different cells and expression systems. However, these results suggest that HBx affects the apoptotic processes by multiple mechanisms, including the inactivation of the p53 functions, interference of DNA repair ability, or modulation of cellular signaling cascades. Our findings on the modulation of PI 3-kinase signaling by HBx in mediating its anti-apoptotic effect offered a new mechanism.The molecular mechanism by which HBx activates PI 3-kinase is addressed hereafter. Because of its well known transactivation function through the increased expression of cytokines or cognate receptors, HBx might establish an autocrine or paracrine loop. HBx was reported to stimulate the expression of cytokines (e.g. interleukin-6 (43Lee Y. Park U.S. Choi I. Yoon S.K. Park Y.M. Lee Y.I. Clini. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 1711-1717PubMed Google Scholar) and insulin-like growth factor-II (44Lee Y.I. Lee S. Lee Y. Bong Y.S. Hyun S.W. Yoo Y.D. Kim S.J. Kim Y.W. Poo H.R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2367-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)) as well as cytokine receptors (e.g. insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (45Kim S.O. Park J.G. Lee Y.I. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3831-3836PubMed Google Scholar) and epidermal growth factor receptor (46Menzo S. Clementi M. Alfani E. Bagnarelli P. Lacovacci S. Manzin A. Dandri M. Natoli G. Levrero M. Carloni G. Virology. 1993; 196: 878-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)). Interleukin-6 was demonstrated to inhibit apoptosis through the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway in hepatoma cells (32Chen R.-H. Chang M.-C. Su Y.-H. Tsai Y.-T. Kuo M.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23013-23019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated tyrosine residues, generated on receptors (e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor) or their associated substrate molecules (such as IRS-1/2 in signaling by insulin and insulin-like growth factor), form the docking sites for the Src homology-2 domains of p85. The interaction mediates the translocation of PI 3-kinase to the receptor tyrosine kinases and their substrate and assists in positioning p110, the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, close to the membranes that contain the lipid substrates. Using Northern blot analysis or a ribonuclease protection assay, HBx did not alter the mRNA level of interleukin-6, TNF-α, or interferon-β (data not shown). The addition of media collected from the overnight culture of HBx-expressing cells did not protect Hep 3B cells from TGF-β-induced apoptosis (data not shown). Although not excluded, the hypothesis that the observed activation of PI 3-kinase by HBx might be due to the secondary results of the primary activation of cytokines or growth factors was not favored.Rather, HBx might work through the modulation of signaling cascades to activate PI 3-kinase. Related investigations reported that HBx modulates several signaling cascades (7Benn J. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10350-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 8Natoli G. Avantaggiati M.L. Chirillo P. Puri P. Ianni A. Balsano C. Levrero M.

A. 1994; 91: 10350-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) indicated that HBx activated Ras-GTP complex formation. Activation of Src family kinases was demonstrated to be indispensable for HBx-mediated activation of Ras (12Klein N.P. Schneider R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6427-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The activated Ras-GTP complex binds to p110, the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, resulting in the activation of PI 3-kinase (47Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). The binding of the Src homology-3 domain of Src family kinases to a proline-rich region within the p85 of PI 3-kinase resulted in the activation of PI 3-kinase (48Pleiman C.M. Marc Hertz W. Cambier J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Lately, HBx has been shown to interact with Jak1 and activate Jak-STAT signaling (49Lee Y.H. Yun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25510-25515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Both Jak (50Sharfe N. Dadi H.K. Roifman C.M.

Science. 1997; 276: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) interact with p85 and activate PI 3-kinase signaling pathway. Therefore, through the activation of Ras, Src family kinases, or JAK-STAT, HBx might be able to achieve its effect on PI 3-kinase. In addition, HBx might directly activate PI 3-kinase. In a glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay, HBx was found to be associated with p110 (data not shown). The contribution of this interaction in the observed elevation of PI 3-kinase activity requires further investigation.It is noteworthy that wortmannin and LY294002 partially blocked the anti-apoptotic activity of HBx (Fig. 4). Although activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway mediated the observed phenomenon, the interference of other molecules by HBx cannot be excluded. A recent investigation confirmed that HBx can inhibit caspase 3 activity (22Gottlob K. Fulco M. Levrero M. Graessmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33347-33353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Chen and Chang (30Chen R.-H. Chang T.-Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 821-827PubMed Google Scholar) reported that caspase 3 was involved in TGF-β-induced apoptosis. However, the contribution of the inhibitory effect of HBx on caspase 3 in our system remains to be elucidated.Polyoma middle T antigen (PMT) is identified as the tumorigenic component of the polyoma virus. PMT forms a complex with pp60c-src and PI 3-kinase, subsequently activating PI 3-kinase (54Courtneidge S.A. Heber A. Cell. 1987; 50: 1031-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Several studies have inferred that a PI 3-kinase signaling pathway is required for PMT-mediated tumorigenesis (35Whitman M. Kaplan D.R. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L. Roberts T.M. Nature. 1985; 315: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 38Dahl J. Jurczak A. Cheng L.A. Baker D.C. Benjamin T.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3221-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our study clearly demonstrated the activation of PI 3-kinase signaling by HBx, subsequently triggering anti-apoptotic signaling. As with PMT, inhibition of apoptosis by HBx could disrupt the normal cellular surveillance mechanism for removing damaged cells, thereby providing a clonal selective advantage for hepatocytes expressing this integrated viral gene during the early stages of human liver carcinogenesis. Mutations that affected the transactivation activity of HBx inhibited its ability to activate PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway and failed to block apoptosis. These observations indicate that transactivation and anti-apoptotic activity of HBx are linked. However, Gottlob et al. (55Gottlob K. Pagano S. Levrero M. Graessmann A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3566-3570PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that transactivation activity is not required for the transforming activity of HBx in REV2 cells. Therefore, additional studies are required to further define whether PI 3-kinase activation and subsequently anti-apoptotic activity are a prerequisite for HBx-mediated transformation. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx)1 has been demonstrated to function as a transcriptional transactivator of a variety of viral and cellular promoter/enhancer elements (1Yen T.S.B. J. Biomed. Sci. 1996; 3: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 2Murakami S. Intervirology. 1999; 42: 81-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although not binding directly to DNA, HBx can transactivate transcription through multiple cis-acting elements including AP-1, AP-2, ATF/CREB, NF-κB, C/EBP, and Egr-1 binding sites. However, the exact mechanism of transactivation still remains unsolved. Previous investigations have demonstrated that HBx interacts in the nucleus with components of the basal transcription machinery, including RPB5, a subunit of all three mammalian RNA polymerases, and several transcription factors (3Cheong J. Yi M. Lin Y. Murakami S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 4Qadri I. Maguire H.F. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, HBx may exert its effect by mimicking the cellular coactivator function.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a potent inducer of apoptosis in hepatocytes and several hepatoma cell lines (24Lin J.-K. Chou C.-K. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 385-388PubMed Google Scholar, 25Oberhammer F.A. Pavelka M. Sharma S. Tiefenbacher R. Purchio A.F. Bursch W. Flermann R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

TGF-β exerts its action through transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors. These receptors propagate the signal by phosphorylating the intracellular targets, Smads. Phosphorylated Smad2 or Smad3 can form a stable complex with Smad4, which then translocates to the nucleus to regulate the transcriptional response to TGF-β (27Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar, 28Zhang Y. Derynck R. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 274-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) whereby TGF-β induces apoptosis is not fully characterized. Nevertheless, induction of oxidative stress (29Sanchez A. Alvarez A.M. Benito M. Fabregat I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7416-7422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), activation of caspase 3 (30Chen R.-H. Chang T.-Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 821-827PubMed Google Scholar), and inhibition of Rb expression (26Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1909-1919PubMed Google Scholar) have been implicated in mediating TGF-β-induced apoptosis. In liver cells, insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (31Tanaka S. Wands J.R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 391-394Google Scholar), as well as interleukin-6 (32Chen R.-H. Chang M.-C. Su Y.-H. Tsai Y.-T. Kuo M.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23013-23019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), all block TGF-β-induced apoptosis. Recent studies have revealed that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and its downstream target, Akt, are responsible for the anti-apoptotic activity of these factors against TGF-β (32Chen R.-H. Chang M.-C. Su Y.-H. Tsai Y.-T. Kuo M.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23013-23019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 33Chen R.-H. Su Y.-H. Chuang R.L.C. Chang T.-Y. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To elucidate the correlation between the HBx gene and its response to apoptotic stimuli, the effect of HBx gene expression on TGF-β-induced apoptosis in the Hep 3B cell line was examined. Cells with constitutive or inducible expression of wild or mutant HBx were generated and tested. Transactivation-proficient HBx inhibited TGF-β-induced apoptosis. The PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway was involved in the HBx-mediated anti-apoptotic effect. DISCUSSIONThis study has demonstrated that HBx effectively suppresses TGF-β-induced apoptotic death of hepatoma cells. The HBx-mediated anti-apoptotic effect was not mediated through decreased expression of TGF-β receptors. Two specific inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, wortmannin and LY294002, blocked the anti-apoptotic effect of HBx, implying that HBx might affect the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway in mediating the effect. In cells expressing HBx, the PI 3-kinase activity and not its protein level was elevated. An increased phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 resulted. The anti-apoptotic mechanism of HBx was attributed, at least in part, to the activation of PI 3-kinase signaling cascades.The effects of HBx on cell death or apoptosis have been studied by several groups. p53-dependent apoptosis was prevented by microinjection of HBx into primary fibroblasts (18Wang X.W. Gibson M.K. Vermenlen W. Forrester K. Sturzbecher H.W. Hoeijmaker J.H.J. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6012-6016PubMed Google Scholar). Chirillo et al. (19Chirillo P. Pagano S. Natoli G. Puri P.L. Burgio U.L. Balsano C. Levrero M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8162-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) demonstrated that after DNA damage, HBx induced p53-dependent apoptosis in NIH3T3 cells transiently expressing HBx. In Chang liver cells, HBx failed to induce apoptosis; however, it did sensitize cells to apoptosis triggered by TNF-α (20Su F. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8744-8749Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Upon the induction of HBx expression mediated by theCre/loxP recombination system, liver cell apoptosis was observed independently of the p53 pathway (41Shintani Y. Yotsuyanangi H. Moriya K. Fujie H. Tsutsumi I. Kanegae Y. Kimura S. Saito I. Koike K. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3257-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The liver cells derived from a transgenic mouse were more susceptible to diverse apoptosis insults, and this phenomenon was not dependent upon p53 (42Terradillos O. Pollicino T. Lecoeur H. Tripodi M. Gougeon M.L. Tiollais P. Buendia M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2115-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These seemingly contradictory results of HBx on apoptotic events might be attributable to the utilization of different cells and expression systems. However, these results suggest that HBx affects the apoptotic processes by multiple mechanisms, including the inactivation of the p53 functions, interference of DNA repair ability, or modulation of cellular signaling cascades. Our findings on the modulation of PI 3-kinase signaling by HBx in mediating its anti-apoptotic effect offered a new mechanism.The molecular mechanism by which HBx activates PI 3-kinase is addressed hereafter. Because of its well known transactivation function through the increased expression of cytokines or cognate receptors, HBx might establish an autocrine or paracrine loop. HBx was reported to stimulate the expression of cytokines (e.g. interleukin-6 (43Lee Y. Park U.S. Choi I. Yoon S.K. Park Y.M. Lee Y.I. Clini. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 1711-1717PubMed Google Scholar) and insulin-like growth factor-II (44Lee Y.I. Lee S. Lee Y. Bong Y.S. Hyun S.W. Yoo Y.D. Kim S.J. Kim Y.W. Poo H.R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2367-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)) as well as cytokine receptors (e.g. insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (45Kim S.O. Park J.G. Lee Y.I. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3831-3836PubMed Google Scholar) and epidermal growth factor receptor (46Menzo S. Clementi M. Alfani E. Bagnarelli P. Lacovacci S. Manzin A. Dandri M. Natoli G. Levrero M. Carloni G. Virology. 1993; 196: 878-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)). Interleukin-6 was demonstrated to inhibit apoptosis through the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway in hepatoma cells (32Chen R.-H. Chang M.-C. Su Y.-H. Tsai Y.-T. Kuo M.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23013-23019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated tyrosine residues, generated on receptors (e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor) or their associated substrate molecules (such as IRS-1/2 in signaling by insulin and insulin-like growth factor), form the docking sites for the Src homology-2 domains of p85. The interaction mediates the translocation of PI 3-kinase to the receptor tyrosine kinases and their substrate and assists in positioning p110, the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, close to the membranes that contain the lipid substrates. Using Northern blot analysis or a ribonuclease protection assay, HBx did not alter the mRNA level of interleukin-6, TNF-α, or interferon-β (data not shown). The addition of media collected from the overnight culture of HBx-expressing cells did not protect Hep 3B cells from TGF-β-induced apoptosis (data not shown). Although not excluded, the hypothesis that the observed activation of PI 3-kinase by HBx might be due to the secondary results of the primary activation of cytokines or growth factors was not favored.Rather, HBx might work through the modulation of signaling cascades to activate PI 3-kinase. Related investigations reported that HBx modulates several signaling cascades (7Benn J. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10350-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 8Natoli G. Avantaggiati M.L. Chirillo P. Puri P. Ianni A. Balsano C. Levrero M.

A. 1994; 91: 10350-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) indicated that HBx activated Ras-GTP complex formation. Activation of Src family kinases was demonstrated to be indispensable for HBx-mediated activation of Ras (12Klein N.P. Schneider R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6427-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The activated Ras-GTP complex binds to p110, the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, resulting in the activation of PI 3-kinase (47Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). The binding of the Src homology-3 domain of Src family kinases to a proline-rich region within the p85 of PI 3-kinase resulted in the activation of PI 3-kinase (48Pleiman C.M. Marc Hertz W. Cambier J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Lately, HBx has been shown to interact with Jak1 and activate Jak-STAT signaling (49Lee Y.H. Yun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25510-25515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Both Jak (50Sharfe N. Dadi H.K. Roifman C.M.

Science. 1997; 276: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) interact with p85 and activate PI 3-kinase signaling pathway. Therefore, through the activation of Ras, Src family kinases, or JAK-STAT, HBx might be able to achieve its effect on PI 3-kinase. In addition, HBx might directly activate PI 3-kinase. In a glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay, HBx was found to be associated with p110 (data not shown). The contribution of this interaction in the observed elevation of PI 3-kinase activity requires further investigation.It is noteworthy that wortmannin and LY294002 partially blocked the anti-apoptotic activity of HBx (Fig. 4). Although activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway mediated the observed phenomenon, the interference of other molecules by HBx cannot be excluded. A recent investigation confirmed that HBx can inhibit caspase 3 activity (22Gottlob K. Fulco M. Levrero M. Graessmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33347-33353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Chen and Chang (30Chen R.-H. Chang T.-Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 821-827PubMed Google Scholar) reported that caspase 3 was involved in TGF-β-induced apoptosis. However, the contribution of the inhibitory effect of HBx on caspase 3 in our system remains to be elucidated.Polyoma middle T antigen (PMT) is identified as the tumorigenic component of the polyoma virus. PMT forms a complex with pp60c-src and PI 3-kinase, subsequently activating PI 3-kinase (54Courtneidge S.A. Heber A. Cell. 1987; 50: 1031-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Several studies have inferred that a PI 3-kinase signaling pathway is required for PMT-mediated tumorigenesis (35Whitman M. Kaplan D.R. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L. Roberts T.M. Nature. 1985; 315: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 38Dahl J. Jurczak A. Cheng L.A. Baker D.C. Benjamin T.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3221-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our study clearly demonstrated the activation of PI 3-kinase signaling by HBx, subsequently triggering anti-apoptotic signaling. As with PMT, inhibition of apoptosis by HBx could disrupt the normal cellular surveillance mechanism for removing damaged cells, thereby providing a clonal selective advantage for hepatocytes expressing this integrated viral gene during the early stages of human liver carcinogenesis. Mutations that affected the transactivation activity of HBx inhibited its ability to activate PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway and failed to block apoptosis. These observations indicate that transactivation and anti-apoptotic activity of HBx are linked. However, Gottlob et al. (55Gottlob K. Pagano S. Levrero M. Graessmann A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3566-3570PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that transactivation activity is not required for the transforming activity of HBx in REV2 cells. Therefore, additional studies are required to further define whether PI 3-kinase activation and subsequently anti-apoptotic activity are a prerequisite for HBx-mediated transformation. This study has demonstrated that HBx effectively suppresses TGF-β-induced apoptotic death of hepatoma cells. The HBx-mediated anti-apoptotic effect was not mediated through decreased expression of TGF-β receptors. Two specific inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, wortmannin and LY294002, blocked the anti-apoptotic effect of HBx, implying that HBx might affect the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway in mediating the effect.

Several studies have inferred that a PI 3-kinase signaling pathway is required for PMT-mediated tumorigenesis (35Whitman M. Kaplan D.R. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L. Roberts T.M. Nature. 1985; 315: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 38Dahl J. Jurczak A. Cheng L.A. Baker D.C. Benjamin T.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3221-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our study clearly demonstrated the activation of PI 3-kinase signaling by HBx, subsequently triggering anti-apoptotic signaling. As with PMT, inhibition of apoptosis by HBx could disrupt the normal cellular surveillance mechanism for removing damaged cells, thereby providing a clonal selective advantage for hepatocytes expressing this integrated viral gene during the early stages of human liver carcinogenesis. Mutations that affected the transactivation activity of HBx inhibited its ability to activate PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway and failed to block apoptosis. These observations indicate that transactivation and anti-apoptotic activity of HBx are linked. However, Gottlob et al. (55Gottlob K. Pagano S. Levrero M. Graessmann A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3566-3570PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that transactivation activity is not required for the transforming activity of HBx in REV2 cells. Therefore, additional studies are required to further define whether PI 3-kinase activation and subsequently anti-apoptotic activity are a prerequisite for HBx-mediated transformation. We thank Dr. Rey-Hwa Chen for valuable comments and Dr. H.-F. Yang-Yen for providing helpful instructions on the PI 3-kinase assay. We also acknowledge Mr. Ted Knoy for revision of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1918726675,"Parkinson's disease is characterized by the mesencephalic dopaminergic neuronal loss, possibly by apoptosis, and the prevalence is higher in males than in females. The estrogen receptor (ER) subtype in the mesencephalon is exclusively ER beta, a recently cloned novel subtype. Bound with estradiol, it enhances gene transcription through the estrogen response element (ERE) or inhibits it through the activator protein-1 (AP-1) site. We demonstrated that 17beta-estradiol provided protection against nigral neuronal apoptosis caused by exposure to either bleomycin sulfate (BLM) or buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). BLM and BSO-induced nigral apoptosis was blocked by inhibitors for caspase-3 or c-Jun/AP-1. The antiapoptotic effect by estradiol was blocked by ICI 182,780, an antagonist for ER, but not by a synthesized peptide that inhibits binding of the ER to the ERE. Estradiol had no effects on caspase-3 activation and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK), which were activated by BLM. It also suppressed apoptosis by serum deprivation, which was independent of caspase-3 activation. Therefore, the antiapoptotic neuroprotection by estradiol is mediated by transcription through AP-1 site downstream from JNK and caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, 17alpha-estradiol, a stereoisomer without female hormone activity, also provided an antiapoptotic effect. Therefore, the antiapoptotic effect is independent of female hormone activity."
https://openalex.org/W1945903641,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is primarily nonfamilial or sporadic (SAD) in origin, although several genetic linkages are reported. Tissues from AD patients contain fibrillar plaques made of 39 to 43 amino acid-long amyloid beta peptide (AbetaP), although the mechanisms of AbetaP toxicity are poorly understood. AbetaP(1-40) is the most prevalent AbetaP present in the neuronal and non-neuronal tissues from SAD patients. AbetaP(1-40) toxicity has been examined mainly after prolonged incubation and correlates with the age and fibrillar morphology of AbetaP(1-40). Globular and nonfibrillar AbetaPs are released continually during normal cellular metabolism; they elevate cellular Ca(2+) and form cation-permeable channels. However, their role in cellular toxicity is poorly understood. We have used an integrated atomic force and light fluorescence microscopy (AFM-LFM), laser confocal microscopy, and calcium imaging to examine real-time and acute effect of fresh and globular AbetaP(1-40) on cultured, aged human, AD-free fibroblasts. AFM images show that freshly prepared AbetaP(1-40) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) are globular and do not form fiber for an extended time period. AbetaP(1-40) induced rapid structural modifications, including cytoskeletal reorganization, retraction of cellular processes, and loss of cell-cell contacts, within minutes of incubation. This led to eventual cellular degeneration. AbetaP(1-40)-induced degeneration was prevented by anti-AbetaP antibody, zinc, and Tris, but not by tachykinin neuropeptides. In Ca(2+)-free extracellular medium, AbetaP(1-40) did not induce cellular degeneration. In the presence of extracellular Ca(2+), AbetaP(1-40) induced a sustained increase in the cellular Ca(2+). Thus, short-term and acute AbetaP(1-40) toxicity is mediated by Ca(2+) uptake, most likely via calcium-permeable AbetaP pores. Such rapid degeneration does not require fibrillar plaques, suggesting that the plaques may not have any causative role."
https://openalex.org/W2001278383,"The αvβ3integrin has been shown to bind several ligands, including osteopontin and vitronectin. Its role in modulating cell migration and downstream signaling pathways in response to specific extracellular matrix ligands has been investigated in this study. Highly invasive prostate cancer PC3 cells that constitutively express αvβ3adhere and migrate on osteopontin and vitronectin in an αvβ3-dependent manner. However, exogenous expression of αvβ3 in noninvasive prostate cancer LNCaP (β3-LNCaP) cells mediates adhesion and migration on vitronectin but not on osteopontin. Activation of αvβ3 by epidermal growth factor stimulation is required to mediate adhesion to osteopontin but is not sufficient to support migration on this substrate. We show that αvβ3-mediated cell migration requires activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)/protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) pathway since wortmannin, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor, prevents PC3 cell migration on both osteopontin and vitronectin; furthermore, αvβ3 engagement by osteopontin and vitronectin activates the PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway. Migration of β3-LNCaP cells on vitronectin also occurs through activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway; however, AKT phosphorylation is not increased upon engagement by osteopontin. Furthermore, phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), known to support cell migration in β3-LNCaP cells, is detected on both substrates. Thus, in PC3 cells, αvβ3mediates cell migration and PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway activation on vitronectin and osteopontin; in β3-LNCaP cells, αvβ3 mediates cell migration and PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway activation on vitronectin, whereas adhesion to osteopontin does not support αvβ3-mediated cell migration and PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway activation. We conclude therefore that αvβ3 exists in multiple functional states that can bind either selectively vitronectin or both vitronectin and osteopontin and that can differentially activate cell migration and intracellular signaling pathways in a ligand-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W1986807291,"We characterized a novel guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Ras family G proteins that is highly homologous to CalDAG-GEFI, a GEF for Rap1 and R-Ras, and to RasGRP/CalDAG-GEFII, a GEF for Ras and R-Ras. This novel GEF, referred to as CalDAG-GEFIII, increased the GTP/GDP ratio of Ha-Ras, R-Ras, and Rap1 in 293T cells. CalDAG-GEFIII promoted the guanine nucleotide exchange of Ha-Ras, R-Ras, and Rap1 in vitroalso, indicating that CalDAG-GEFIII exhibited the widest substrate specificity among the known GEFs for Ras family G proteins. Expression of CalDAG-GEFIII was detected in the glial cells of the brain and the glomerular mesangial cells of the kidney by in situhybridization. CalDAG-GEFIII activated ERK/MAPK most efficiently, followed by CalDAG-GEFII and CalDAG-GEFI in 293T cells. JNK activation was most prominent in cells expressing CalDAG-GEFII, followed by CalDAG-GEFIII and CalDAG-GEFI. Expression of CalDAG-GEFIII induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells and anchorage-independent growth of Rat1A cells less efficiently than did CalDAG-GEFII.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). By phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences, these Ras family G proteins can be divided further into five subfamilies, the classical Ras (Ha-, K-, and N-), R-Ras, Rap, Ral, and the others. Among them, the classical Ras has been studied most extensively as a critical protein in cell growth and differentiation (2Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Like the classic Ras proteins (Ha-, K-, and N-Ras), all proteins of the R-Ras subfamily transform NIH3T3 cells, although less efficiently than does the classic Ras (3Ehrhardt G.R.A. Leslie K.B.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). GEFs promote GDP dissociation and GTP binding of the Ras family G proteins. The GTP-bound Ras family G proteins bind to and activate the effector proteins to transmit signals further downstream. The first mammalian GEF for the Ras family G protein, Ras-GRF, was identified as a protein that shares high sequence homology with the yeast GEF, CDC25 (11Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This was followed by the discovery of Sos, RalGDS, and C3G (12Quilliam L.A. Khosravifar R. Huff S.Y. Der C.J. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), which are GEFs for Ras, Ral, and Rap1, respectively. Recently, owing to the progress in genome sequencing projects, the number of GEFs for Ras family G proteins has been increasing rapidly. These GEFs may be classified according to their major upstream signaling cascades. Sos and C3G are activated by tyrosine kinases (13Feig L.A. Schaffhausen B.

Of note, even with the recent increase in the number of GEFs, there is no report on a GEF that is specific for the R-Ras subfamily. In this report, we characterize KIAA0846, which was isolated by the KAZUSA human cDNA sequencing project. KIAA0846 shares high sequence homology with CalDAG-GEFI and CalDAG-GEFII. This protein, named CalDAG-GEFIII, shows the widest substrate specificity among the known GEFs. pBluescript-SKII-(+)-KIAA0846 and pBluescript-SKII-(+)-KIAA0351 were provided by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute. The entire coding region of this human KIAA0846 was amplified by PCR with specific primers (sense oligo, 5′-CTCGAGATGGGATCAAGTGGCCTTGGGAAA-3′, and antisense oligo, 5′-GCGGCCGCTCAGCCATCCTCACCATCCTGT-3′) and subcloned into pCXN2-FLAG (25Niwa H.

Chimeric cDNAs between CalDAG-GEFI and CalDAG-GEFII were prepared by two-step PCR. CalDAG-GEFI/II consisted of the amino-terminal catalytic domain of CalDAG-GEFI (amino acids 1–396) and the carboxyl-terminal regulatory region of CalDAG-GEFII (amino acid 445–795), including the EF hand and C1 domain. Similarly, CalDAG-GEFII/I consisted of amino acids 1–444 of CalDAG-GEFII and amino acids 397–608 of CalDAG-GEFI. cDNA of Krev1/Rap1A was provided by M. Noda (Kyoto University, Kyoto).

Sense and antisense RNA probes were obtained by run-off transcription of pBluescript SKII (+)-CalDAG-GEFI, pBluescript SKII (+)-CalDAG-GEFII, and pCR-BluntII-Topo-CalDAG-GEFIII with a digoxigenin-RNA labeling kit and SP6, T3, or T7 polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (32Schaeren-Wiemers N. Gerfin-Moser A. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Briefly, brain and kidney of B6 mice were embedded in Tissue-Tec OCT compound (Miles) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sections of 6-μm thickness were prepared with a cryostat, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and acetylated in 0.1 m triethanolamine with 0.25% acetic anhydride. Sections were prehybridized with hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 6× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, 500 μg/ml tRNA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) at room temperature for 16 h. After the addition of hybridization buffer containing a heat-denatured digoxigenin-RNA probe, sections were incubated overnight at 70 °C. The probes were detected with anti-digoxigenin antibody and nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate solution containing 0.2 mg/ml levamisole (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Human 293T embryonic kidney cells and Rat-1A cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Nissui, Tokyo) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. PC12 cells were maintained in DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum and 5% horse serum. 293T cells were transfected with plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Guanine nucleotide exchange activity of GEFs was analyzed in 293T cells as described previously (26Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). 293T cells in dishes 3.5 cm in diameter were transfected with pEBG-derived vectors encoding Ras family G proteins and with pCXN2-FLAG-derived vectors encoding GEFs. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were labeled for 4 h with 32Pi in phosphate-free minimum Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were lysed in TLC lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1% Triton X-100) and cleared by centrifugation. The supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then washed twice with TLC lysis buffer and once with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2). Beads were resuspended in 2% SDS and boiled. The supernatant was spotted on polyethyleneimine-coated plates (Macherey & Nagel). The TLC plate was developed with 0.5mH3PO4-KH2PO4, pH 3.4, and analyzed on a BAS1000 image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The guanine nucleotide exchange activity of GEFs was analyzed in vitro by use of a fluorescent analogue of GDP, mant-GDP (2′,3′-bis(O)-(N-methylanthranolol)-GDP), as described previously (33Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). mant-GDP was produced by Dojin Kagaku (Kumamoto, Japan). GST-Ha-Ras, GST-R-Ras, or GST-Rap1A (45 μm) was incubated in exchange buffer (15 mmEDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 7.5 mm mant-GDP) for 2 h at 25 °C. After the addition of MgCl2 to 20 mm, GST-Ha-Ras, GST-R-Ras, or GST-Rap1A bound to mant-GDP was purified on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The mant-GDP loading efficiency for Ha-Ras or Rap1A was between 80 and 90% and that for R-Ras was between 50 and 60%. For the measurement of GEF activity, 400 nm labeled Ha-Ras, R-Ras, or Rap1A was incubated with or without 100 nm GEFs in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) at 20 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of GTP to 200 μm, and the decrease in fluorescence was monitored in a luminescence spectrometer, JASCO FP-750 (JASCO, Japan), with excitation and emission wavelengths of 366 and 450 nm, respectively. The activity of ERK and JNK was examined as described previously (34Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). 293T cells in dishes 3.5 cm in diameter were cotransfected with pEBG-ERK or pEBG-JNK and with expression vectors for GEFs. Twenty four hours post-transfection, cells were lysed in kinase lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol). Glutathione-Sepharose beads were added to the cleared lysates and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed with KLB and kinase buffer (50 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2) and incubated with 15 μl of kinase reaction mixture at 30 °C for 10 min. Kinase reaction mixture is kinase buffer containing 100 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.2 mg/ml myelin basic protein (Sigma) for ERK or GST-c-Jun for JNK. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 5× Laemmli sample buffer, and proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The radioactivity of the substrates was quantitated with a BAS1000 image analyzer. PC12 cells were transfected with expression plasmids by the use of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 48 h later observed under a microscope (34Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). PC12 cells that extended neurites longer than 2-fold of the diameter of the cell body were counted as differentiated cells. Rat-1A cells were transfected with pCXN2-FLAG-derived CalDAG-GEF expression vectors by use of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were selected with 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and well isolated colonies were maintained in medium containing 400 μg/ml G418. A colony formation assay was performed as described previously (35Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Briefly, 105 cells before and after cloning were cultured in DMEM containing 0.8% agarose with 2 or 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Two weeks later, colonies larger than 0.5 mm in diameter were counted. Analysis of GTP-bound Ras family G proteins was performed by the method of Bos and co-workers (29Franke B. Akkerman J.W.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 15: 252-259Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Rat-1A cells were serum-starved for 36 h, lysed in pull-down lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm Na3VO4), and clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was incubated with GST-tagged RalGDS-RBD or GST-tagged Raf-RBD + CRD prebound to glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C. GST-RalGDS-RBD and GST-Raf-RBD + CRD were used for the detection of GTP-Rap1 and GTP-Ras, respectively. Beads were washed twice with pull-down lysis buffer, resuspended in Laemmli's sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting analysis with anti-Ras or anti-Rap1 antibody. We carried out a data base search for new GEFs for the Ras family G proteins and identified KIAA0846. Through the entire coding region, KIAA0846 showed high amino acid sequence homology to both CalDAG-GEFI and CalDAG-GEFII (Fig.1). Based on this high sequence homology, KIAA0846 was designated as CalDAG-GEFIII. CalDAG-GEFIII contained a CDC25 homology domain, an EF hand, and a C1 domain, as do CalDAG-GEFI and CalDAG-GEFII. The phylogenetic tree of the CDC25 domains of GEFs for Ras family G proteins proved that CalDAG-GEFIII was most closely related to CalDAG-GEFII. Whereas this CalDAG-GEF branch contains GEFs for Ras, R-Ras, and Rap1, GEFs in another branch consisting of nRap GEP/PDZ-GEF1/RA-GEF, GFR, Epac/cAMP-GEFI, and cAMP-GEFII are specific for Rap1. In reverse transcriptase-PCR assay, expression of CalDAG-GEFIII has been detected in brain, heart, lung, and kidney. We confirmed the expression of CalDAG-GEFIII mRNA by Northern blotting analysis in the brain but not in the other organs. 2S. Yamashita, N. Mochizuki, and M. Matsuda, unpublished results. We further examined the cell type-specific expression of CalDAG-GEFIII by in situ hybridization and compared it with those of CalDAG-GEFI and CalDAG-GEFII. All CalDAG-GEFs were expressed in the brain. However, we found a remarkable difference in the distribution of the cells expressing each of the CalDAG-GEFs (Fig.2). As reported previously, CalDAG-GEFI was expressed most abundantly in the basal ganglia (16Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J. Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). High level expression of CalDAG-GEFII was observed in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum (15Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 16Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J. Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In contrast, CalDAG-GEFIII was expressed most prominently in the glial cells of the cerebral and cerebellar white matter. These cells were negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein, a marker for astrocyte, suggesting that CalDAG-GEFIII was expressed mostly in the oligodendroglia. 3Y. Okada, H. Sawa, and K. Nagashima, unpublished results. In the kidney also, expression of CalDAG-GEFs did not overlap each other. CalDAG-GEFI was expressed in the interstitial cells, CalDAG-GEFII in the epithelium of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting tubules, and CalDAG-GEFIII in the mesangial cells of the glomeruli. Thus, this observation showed that the three CalDAG-GEFs play a role in the cell type-specific regulation of Ras family G proteins by calcium and diacylglycerol. The substrate specificity of CalDAG-GEFIII was examined first in 293T cells (Fig. 3 A). The expression of CalDAG-GEFIII significantly increased the GTP-bound form of Ha-Ras, R-Ras, Rap1A, and Rap2A. CalDAG-GEFIII did not activate RalA; therefore, the activity of CalDAG-GEFIII was restricted to the Ras, R-Ras, and Rap subfamilies. We used KIAA0351 as a positive control for the Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor. As reported previously (15Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 16Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J. Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A.

A. 1998; 95: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), CalDAG-GEFI activated Rap1 and, to a lesser extent, R-Ras, and CalDAG-GEFII activated both Ha-Ras and R-Ras. To exclude the possibility that the regulatory domain modifies the substrate specificity of CalDAG-GEFs, we constructed chimeric proteins between CalDAG-GEFI and CalDAG-GEFII. CalDAG-GEFI/II consisted of the catalytic domain of CalDAG-GEFI and the regulatory domain of CalDAG-GEFII, whereas CalDAG-GEFII/I consisted of the catalytic domain of CalDAG-GEFII and the regulatory domain of CalDAG-GEFI. As shown in Fig. 3 B, CalDAG-GEFI/II and CalDAG-GEFII/I showed substrate specificity identical to that of CalDAG-GEFI and CalDAG-GEFII, respectively, indicating that the regulatory domains did not alter the substrate specificity of CalDAG-GEFI or CalDAG-GEFII. We confirmed the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of CalDAG-GEFIII in vitro. For this purpose, we expressed and purified the catalytic domains of CalDAG-GEFs from Escherichia coli. Rap1A, R-Ras, and Ha-Ras were loaded with mant-GDP, and its dissociation in the presence of CalDAG-GEFs was monitored with a fluoro-spectrometer (Fig. 4). Rate constants were calculated as described previously (TableI) (33Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Release of the mant-GDP from Ha-Ras was promoted by CalDAG-GEFIII and, to a lesser extent, CalDAG-GEFII, whereas the release of mant-GDP from Rap1A was promoted by CalDAG-GEFI and, less efficiently, by CalDAG-GEFIII. Dissociation of mant-GDP from R-Ras was promoted by CalDAG-GEFIII, followed by CalDAG-GEFII and CalDAG-GEFI. Thus, the CalDAG-GEFIII promoted guanine nucleotide exchange of Ha-Ras, R-Ras, and Rap1 both in vivoand in vitro.Table ISummary of the interaction of CalDAG-GEFs with Ha-Ras, R-Ras, and Rap1, as measured by fluorescence assayIntrinsic rateCalDAG-GEF1CalDAG-GEFIICalDAG-GEFIIIHa-Ras1.21.05.042.0R-Ras3.78.819.058.0Rap1A1.929.01.35.2Rate constants are given in 10−4 units/s. Open table in a new tab Rate constants are given in 10−4 units/s. To understand the role of the broad substrate specificity of CalDAG-GEFIII, we measured the activity of ERK and JNK in 293T cells expressing CalDAG-GEFs (Fig. 5). Activation of ERK/MAPK was most prominent by CalDAG-GEFIII, followed by CalDAG-GEFII. In contrast, JNK was activated most strongly by CalDAG-GEFII, followed by CalDAG-GEFIII. Activation of ERK or JNK by CalDAG-GEFI was marginal. Because we did not find any significant difference in the expression levels of CalDAG-GEFs, the difference in the activation of ERK/MAPK and JNK seemed to reflect the difference in the substrate specificity. It is known that constitutive activation of ERK/MAPK induces neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (36Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the biological activity of CalDAG-GEFIII, we introduced CAAXbox-containing active CalDAG-GEFs into PC12 cells (Fig.6). Neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells, which was evaluated by the number and the length of the neurites, was most prominent when we expressed CalDAG-GEFII-CAAX, followed by CalDAG-GEFIII-CAAX. CalDAG-GEFI-CAAX did not induce neurite outgrowth. Interestingly, whereas CalDAG- GEFII-expressing cells exhibited typical neurite extension, cells expressing CalDAG-GEFIII showed spreading of the cytoplasm with wide neurites. The transfection efficiency of the expression vectors in PC12 cells exceeded 50% in all cases when the cells were immunostained with anti-FLAG antibody (data not shown). The amount of each protein was also within a comparable level. Next, we compared the colony-forming activity of Rat-1A cells transfected with CalDAG-GEFs. In our initial experiment, we transfected Rat-1A cells with CalDAG-GEF expression vectors, selected with G418, and examined the bulk of the drug-resistant colonies for the anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. As shown in Fig. 7 A, CalDAG-GEFIII induced colony formation less efficiently than did CalDAG-GEFII and CalDAG-GEFII/I. CalDAG-GEFI and CalDAG-GEFI/II, both of which could not activate Ras, did not induce anchorage-independent growth. To avoid possible bias in the expression level of each CalDAG-GEF, we isolated several independent drug-resistant colonies and obtained cell lines with equivalent expression levels (Fig. 7 C). Again, we found that the colony formation efficiency of cells expressing CalDAG-GEFIII was significantly lower than that of cells expressing CalDAG-GEFII (Fig. 7 B). We observed similar levels of increase in GTP-Ras in cells expressing CalDAG-GEFII and CalDAG- GEFIII (Fig.7 D). The level of GTP-Rap1 was highest in cells expressing CalDAG-GEFI, followed by CalDAG-GEFIII-expressing cells. This result suggests that the activation of Rap1 by CalDAG-GEFIII attenuated the Ras-dependent growth of Rat-1A cells in soft agar. We have characterized CalDAG-GEFIII, which shows the broadest substrate specificity among GEFs for Ras family G proteins,i.e. this is the first GEF that activates G proteins of the Ras, R-Ras, and Rap subfamilies. The phylogenetic analysis of the catalytic domain of GEFs of Ras family G proteins showed that CalDAG-GEFI, CalDAG-GEFII, and CalDAG- GEFIII made up a subfamily. All three CalDAG-GEFs promoted the guanine nucleotide exchange of R-Ras, although the levels of activation differed significantly for each CalDAG-GEF. CalDAG-GEFI and CalDAG-GEFII differed in that the former stimulated Rap1, whereas the latter stimulated Ras. Identification of CalDAG-GEFIII, which activated Ras, R-Ras, and Rap1, strongly suggests that the prototype CalDAG-GEF catalyzed the guanine nucleotide exchange of all of the Ras, R-Ras, and Rap subfamilies and that CalDAG-GEFI and CalDAG-GEFII lost the capability to catalyze Ras and Rap1, respectively, during evolution. Interestingly, there is only one CalDAG-GEF in Caenorhabditis elegans. Determination of the substrate specificity of C. elegans CalDAG-GEF will provide insights into the evolution CalDAG-GEFs. GEFs that activate both R-Ras and Rap1 or R-Ras and Ras have already been reported (23Gotoh T. Niino Y. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18602-18607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); however, the finding that CalDAG-GEFIII promoted the guanine nucleotide exchange of these three subfamilies of G proteins questioned about the specificity in the signaling from GEFs to Ras family G proteins. The Ras, R-Ras, and Rap1 subfamilies of G proteins are expressed ubiquitously (37Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: M19-M31Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), suggesting that CalDAG-GEFIII-expressing cells also express all of these three Ras subfamily G proteins. Although we showed that CalDAG-GEFIII activates Ras, R-Ras, and Rap1 in vitro and in cultured cells, this does not necessarily confirm that CalDAG-GEFIII promotes the guanine nucleotide exchange reaction of these G proteins in vivo, particularly in highly differentiated cells. There are two possibilities to explain the redundancy in the substrate specificity. CalDAG-GEFIII may be used to activate simultaneously all of the Ras, R-Ras, and Rap1 subfamilies. Alternatively, there may be a mechanism that restricts the substrate specificity of CalDAG-GEFIIIin vivo. For example, Rap1 is believed to be localized in the Golgi apparatus, whereas Ras is localized mostly at the plasma membrane (38Beranger F. Goud B. Tavitian A. de Gunzburg J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1606-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, CalDAG-GEFIII may be used to activate Ras at the plasma membrane and Rap1 at the Golgi apparatus. To solve these problems, we must develop methods to stimulate GEFs without overexpression and to measure the level of GTP-binding form without disrupting the structure of the cell. CalDAG-GEFIII, like CalDAG-GEFII, retained biological phenotypes attributable to the activation of Ras, including the activation of ERK/MAPK, the induction of neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells, and the transformation of Rat-1A cells (36Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). However, there were apparent differences between CalDAG-GEFII and CalDAG-GEFIII in the level of these biological effects. CalDAG-GEFIII consistently activated Ras and ERK/MAPK more strongly than did CalDAG-GEFII in 293T cells or in vitro. Nevertheless, CalDAG-GEFIII induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells and transformation of Rat-1A cells less efficiently than did CalDAG-GEFII. Therefore, the attenuated phenotype of CalDAG-GEFIII appeared to result from its activity toward Rap1, which is known to antagonize Ras (7Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Rap1 is reported to induce neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells via B-Raf activation (39Grewal S.S. York R.D. Stork P.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 544-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). However, none of Rap1, C3G, Epac, and CalDAG-GEFI induced neurite outgrowth of the PC12 cells used in our experiments, negating the positive contribution of Rap1 in CalDAG-GEFIII-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells used in our laboratory. 2S. Yamashita, N. Mochizuki, and M. Matsuda, unpublished results. Rather, our observation suggested that co-stimulation of Rap1 by CalDAG-GEFIII attenuated the effect of Ras. It has been reported that Rap1 inhibits Ras transformation by the competitive binding to c-Raf (40Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 41Hu C.D. Kariya K. Kotani G. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11702-11705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, more recently, it has also been reported that Rap1 may enhance cell attachment by activating integrins, suggesting that Rap1 exerts its anti-Ras effect apart from c-Raf inhibition (9Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 19Ohtsuka T. Hata Y. Ide N. Yasuda T. Inoue E. Inoue T.

In conclusion, we characterized CalDAG-GEFIII, which showed the broadest substrate specificity among the known GEFs of Ras family G proteins. Mutually exclusive expression patterns of CalDAG-GEFs in the brain suggest that each CalDAG-GEF plays an important role in the regulation of higher order brain functions. We thank J. L. Bos, A.

https://openalex.org/W2095543547,"The rate of osteoblast apoptosis is a critical determinant of the rate of bone formation. Because the calcium-binding protein calbindin-D28k has anti-apoptotic properties in neuronal cells and lymphocytes, we searched for the presence of this protein in osteoblastic cells and investigated whether it can modify their response to proapoptotic signals. Calbindin-D28K was expressed at low levels in several osteoblastic cell lines and at high levels in primary cultures of murine osteoblastic cells. Transient transfection of rat calbindin-D28k cDNA blocked tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-induced apoptosis in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, as determined by cell viability and nuclear morphology of cells cotransfected with the green fluorescent protein targeted to the nucleus, whereas transfection of the empty vector had no effect. Calbindin-D28k levels in several stably transfected MC3T3-E1 lines were directly related to protection from TNFα-induced apoptosis. Purified rat calbindin-D28k markedly reduced the activity of caspase-3, a critical molecule for the degradation phase of apoptosis, in a cell-free assay. In addition, cell extracts from MC3T3-E1 cells expressing high levels of calbindin-D28k decreased caspase-3 activity, compared with extracts from vector-transfected cells. This effect was apparently unrelated to the calcium binding properties of calbindin, as chelation of calcium by EGTA or addition of other calcium-binding proteins such as calbindin-D9k, S100, calmodulin, and osteocalcin, did not affect caspase-3 activity. Last, calbindin-D28k interacts with the active form of caspase-3 as demonstrated by a GST pull-down assay. These results demonstrate that calbindin-D28k is a biosynthetic product of osteoblasts with a role in the regulation of apoptosis. They also reveal that the antiapoptotic properties of calbindin-D28kmay result not only from calcium buffering but also from the ability of the protein to interact with and to inhibit caspase-3 activity, a property that is independent of its calcium binding capability.

Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-para-nitroanilide tumor necrosis factor polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis glutathioneS-transferase Bone mass is largely determined by the number of bone forming (osteoblasts) and bone resorbing (osteoclasts) cells present in the basic multicellular units responsible for the regeneration of the adult skeleton (1Manolagas S.C.

Similarly to other regenerating tissues, the number of bone cells is controlled by changes not only in the production of mature cells but also in their survival (2Hughes D.E. Boyce B.F. J. Clin. Pathol. ( Lond. ). 1997; 50: 132-137Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 3Manolagas S.C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4377-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that apoptosis represents the most common fate of osteoblasts during physiologic bone remodeling (4Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and that agents that influence the rate of bone formation and bone mass control osteoblast apoptosis in vitro and in vivo (5Weinstein R.S.

Signals that initiate apoptosis trigger the so-called private pathways of death, which are specific for particular groups of stimuli and lead to conversion of procaspases to active caspases. Activation of caspase-3 is the point of convergence of the private pathways, after which specific substrates are cleaved leading to the common executive phase of apoptosis. The end result of this cascade is chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, increase in cell membrane permeability, and ultimately cell death (8Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6137) Google Scholar, 9Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). Even though the participation of calcium in apoptosis is still controversial, several pieces of evidence indicate a role for calcium in the initiation as well as in the degradation phase of apoptosis (10McConkey D.J. Orrenius S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1996; 59: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar,11Macho A. Hirsch T. Marzo I. Marchetti P. Dallaporta B. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4612-4619PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, agents that chelate intracellular calcium, including the calcium-binding protein calbindin-D28k, have been shown to block apoptosis induced by different pro-apoptotic pathways (12Kaiser N. Edelman I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 13Dowd D.R. MacDonald P.N. Komm B.S. Haussler M.R. Miesfeld R.L. Mol.

A. 1998; 95: 3227-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Calbindin-D28k is expressed in high levels in intestine and kidney, tissues in which it may function as a facilitator of calcium diffusion. Expression of calbindin-D28k has been also reported in many other tissues, such as pancreas and brain (15Christakos S. Gabrielides C. Rhoten W.B. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In addition, the protein has been detected by in situ hybridization in developing and adult rat mineralized tissues (16Berdal A. Hotton D. Saffar J.L. Thomasset M. Nanci A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 768-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Berdal A. Hotton D. Pike J.W. Mathieu H. Dupret J.M. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the susceptibility of neurons to apoptosis seems to be inversely related to the level of expression of calbindin in vivo (18Iacopino A.M. Christakos S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4078-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 19Iacopino A. Christakos S. German D. Sonsalla P.K. Altar C.A. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 13: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of calbindin prevents apoptosis in cultured neural cells expressing mutant presenilin-1, a gene whose aberrations account for approximately 50% of all cases of familial Alzheimer's disease (14Guo Q. Christakos S. Robinson N. Mattson M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3227-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Likewise, lymphocytes expressing higher levels of calbindin are more resistant to apoptosis induced by several stimuli (13Dowd D.R. MacDonald P.N. Komm B.S. Haussler M.R. Miesfeld R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1843-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The anti-apoptotic property of calbindin-D28k has been attributed to its ability to chelate calcium. The results of the present study demonstrate that calbindin-D28k is produced by osteoblastic cells and protects them from apoptosis. In addition, they reveal that the anti-apoptotic properties of calbindin-D28k in osteoblasts, as well as in other cell types, may result not only from calcium buffering, but also from the ability of the protein to inhibit caspase-3 activity, which is independent of the calcium binding capability of calbindin-D28k. Calbindin-D28k was purified from rat kidney, as described previously (20Pansini A.R. Christakos S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9735-9741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified rat bone osteocalcin was purchased from Biomedical Technologies Inc. (Stoughton, MA). Purified bovine calbindin-D9k, S100, calmodulin, murine gelsolin, and antibody to β-actin were purchased from Sigma. The caspase-3 activity assay kit, recombinant and purified human caspase-3, and the cell-permeable caspase-3 inhibitor Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (DEVD-CHO)1 were obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc.

Borba V.Z.C. Roberson P.K. Manolagas S.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3666-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Murine osteocytic MLO-Y4 cells (provided by Dr. Lynda Bonewald, University of Texas Health Center at San Antonio, TX) were cultured as described previously (28Kato Y. Windle J.J. Koop B.A. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 2014-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). All culture media contained 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultures were kept in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. Transient transfections of MC3T3-E1 cells were carried out in 12-well culture plates using SuperFect. Cells (0.1 × 106/well) were transfected in triplicate with 2 μg of the expression vectors pBSRα (a gift of Dr. Michael Olszowy, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO) or pREP4 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), alone or containing the cDNA for calbindin-D28k. The calbindin-D28kexpression plasmids were prepared using the full-length calbindin-D28k cDNA isolated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from rat renal distal tubular mRNA. After 24 h, apoptosis was induced by addition of 1 nm TNFα and quantified as indicated below or cell lysates collected for the analysis of calbindin-D28k by Western blotting. For the establishment of MC3T3-E1 cells expressing different levels of calbindin-D28k, parent MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected with pREP4 or pREP4-calbindin-D28k as described previously (14Guo Q. Christakos S. Robinson N. Mattson M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3227-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). After 4 weeks of selection with 400 μg/ml hygromycin, colonies were handpicked under sterile conditions and propagated in 24-well plates. Apoptotic cells were quantified by trypan blue staining. We have previously demonstrated that the percentage of cells exhibiting trypan blue staining correlates with the percentage of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling-labeled cells, indicating that apoptotic osteoblasts could be reliably quantified by either method (4Jilka R.L.

In the experiment of Fig. 3, cells were plated on chamber slides and transfected with the expression vectors pREP4 alone or pREP4-calbindin-D28ktogether with the expression vector for nuclear green fluorescent protein. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were exposed to 1 nm TNFα for 16 h. Subsequently, cells were fixed, mounted, and examined with a Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope. The percentage of apoptosis was determined by examining the nuclear morphology of >150 transfected (fluorescent) cells. Confocal fluorescent images were obtained using an argon laser of 488 nm wavelength and a 530-nm-long pass barrier filter. Cell lysates, protein electrophoresis, and Western blot analysis were performed as described previously (27Bellido T. Borba V.Z.C. Roberson P.K. Manolagas S.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3666-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with an antibody to either calbindin-D28k (30Sonnenberg J. Pansini A.R. Christakos S. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 640-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or β-actin, followed by incubation for 1 h with the corresponding secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Blots were developed by ECL. Quantification of the intensity of the bands in the autoradiograms was performed by laser densitometry. Calbindin protein levels were determined by radioimmunoassay using antiserum against rat renal calbindin and purified rat renal calbindin-D28k as standard, as described previously (30Sonnenberg J. Pansini A.R. Christakos S. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 640-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 was measured in a cell-free assay by determining the degradation of the colorimetric substrate DEVD-para-nitroanilide (DEVD-pNA) that contains the amino acid sequence of the caspase-3 cleavage site in poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (31Schlegel J. Peters I. Orrenius S. Miller D.K. Thornberry N.A. Yamin T.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1841-1844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Thirty units of human recombinant caspase-3 were combined with 200 μm DEVD-pNA in the absence or presence of 0.1 μm DEVD-CHO inhibitor, or 0.5 or 1 μg of purified calbindin D28k, or 1 μg of the calcium binding proteins calmodulin, S100, calbindin-D9K, or osteocalcin, or 1 mm EGTA, or lysates containing 30 μg of proteins from clone c5 or vector-transfected cells. Enzyme activity was calculated based on absorption values at 405 nm. Purified gelsolin (3 μg) or calbindin-D28k (3 μg) and caspase-3 (50 ng) were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in 6 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm KCl. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. GST-calbindin-D28k (provided by Dr. T.-L. Huo, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ) or GST plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli DH5α strain. Isolated colonies resulting from overnight cultures were grown in Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin for 3 h and induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-galactoside for 2 h. Bacterial cultures were centrifuged and sonicated three times for 10 s in chilled phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm CaCl2. GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione beads by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml apoprotenin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. 500 ng of GST-CaBP28k or GST were incubated with 200 or 600 ng of purified caspase-3 in 50 μl of buffer containing 6.0 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, and 1.0 mm KCl for 1 h. Bound proteins were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, eluted in protein electrophoresis buffer, and resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotted with rabbit caspase-3 antiserum (provided by Dr. J. C. Reed, the Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and the Student-Keuls-Newman method was used to estimate the level of significance of differences between means. The effect of TNF treatment and calbindin-D28koverexpression on the proportion of apoptotic cells in the experiment of Fig. 3 was analyzed using exact procedures for logistic regression (32Motulsky H. Intuitive Biostatistics. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar) (LogXact software; CYTEL Software Corp.; Cambridge, MA). Following this, individual pair-wise comparisons of experimental groups were conducted using exact χ2 tests, adjusting the p values with a Bonferroni correction. Allp values (unadjusted for logistic regression; Bonferroni-adjusted for individual group comparisons) were compared with an α value of 0.05 to determine significance. The expression of calbindin-D28kin several cells of the osteoblastic lineage was investigated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1). Compared with kidney, a tissue known to produce calbindin, transformed murine MC3T3-E1, rat ROS17.2, and human MG-63 osteoblastic cell lines, the bone marrow-derived stromal/osteoblastic +/+LDA11 and MBA13 cell lines, or the murine MLO-Y4 osteocytic cell line expressed little, if any, calbindin-D28k, as could be detected by a rabbit anti-calbindin antibody that recognizes rodent and human calbindin (30Sonnenberg J. Pansini A.R. Christakos S. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 640-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). On the other hand, nontransformed osteoblastic cells isolated from neonatal murine calvaria expressed much higher levels of the protein. Recent evidence has suggested the involvement of apoptosis in the regulation of osteoblastic bone formation and osteoclastic bone resorption during adult bone remodeling (2Hughes D.E. Boyce B.F. J. Clin. Pathol. ( Lond. ). 1997; 50: 132-137Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 3Manolagas S.C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4377-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To examine whether expression levels of calbindin-D28k had an effect on apoptosis of osteoblastic cells, MC3T3-E1 cells were transiently transfected with two different expression vectors (pBSRα and pREP4) containing the calbindin-D28k cDNA. As expected, transfectants expressed much higher levels of the protein compared with either parental cells or cells transfected with the empty vectors (Fig.2 A). Consistent with our previous observations demonstrating pro-apoptotic effects of TNFα in MC3T3-E1 cells (4Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), TNF induced apoptosis in cells transfected with either vector alone. In contrast, calbindin-D28ktransfectants were resistant to TNF-induced apoptosis (Fig.2 B). In full agreement with these results, TNFα induced nuclear fragmentation of MC3T3-E1 cells transfected with empty pREP4 vector, as demonstrated by confocal microscopy of cells cotransfected with nuclear green fluorescent protein (10.8% versus 78.1% apoptotic cells in −TNFα and +TNFα, respectively). However, the proapoptotic effect of TNFα was significantly attenuated in cells transfected with calbindin cDNA (0% versus 20.1% apoptotic cells in −TNFα and +TNFα, respectively) (Fig.3). TNF significantly (p< 0.0001) increased, while calbindin significantly (p< 0.0001) decreased the proportion of apoptotic cells, as determined by exact logistic regression. Bonferroni-adjusted pair-wise comparisons of all experimental groups yielded significant differences in the proportion of apoptotic cells between all experimental conditions except the vector alone group versus the calbindin +TNF group (p < 0.31), indicating that overexpression of calbindin-D28k counteracted the pro-apoptotic effect of TNFα. In further support for a relationship between calbindin and protection of apoptosis, the relative expression of calbindin-D28k in MC3T3-E1 cells stable transfectants (clones c1, c3, and c5) corresponded closely to the ability of these transfectants to resist TNF-induced apoptosis (Fig.4).Figure 4The level of calbindin-D28kexpression is directly related to inhibition of TNF α-induced apoptosis.Calbindin-D28k expression in parental MC3T3-E1 cells, and in c1, c3, c5, and vector-transfected clones, was determined by Western blotting and by radioimmunoassay. Apoptosis was assayed by trypan blue uptake. The increase in the number of dead cells induced by TNF in parental MC3T3-E1 and vector-transfected cells was indistinguishable. The response to TNF of clones c1, c3, and c5 was expressed as percent inhibition of apoptosis versus the response to TNF of vector-transfected cells, which was arbitrary considered as 0% inhibition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) From the caspases identified to date, caspase-3 (CPP32/Yama/Apopain) is the most intensively studied. Caspase-3 normally exists in the cytosolic fraction of most mammalian cells and has been suggested to be an important mediator of apoptosis in response to multiple signals, including cytokines (31Schlegel J. Peters I. Orrenius S. Miller D.K. Thornberry N.A. Yamin T.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1841-1844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 33Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar,34Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar). To address the possibility that the anti-apoptotic properties of calbindin were due to direct effects on caspase-3, the effect of calbindin on the activity of this protease was determined (Fig.5). Caspase-3 activity was assayed by measuring the degradation of the colorimetric peptide DEVD-para-nitroanilide. As expected, the activity of caspase-3 was completely inhibited by the specific caspase-3 inhibitor peptide DEVD-CHO. Strikingly, rat purified calbindin also markedly reduced the activity of caspase-3 (Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, cell extracts from MC3T3-E1 cells expressing high levels of calbindin-D28k (c5) decreased by 30% caspase-3 activity, whereas extracts from vector-transfected cells did not change it significantly (Fig. 5 B). Considering that the inhibition of caspase-3 activity by 0.5 μg of purified calbindin was about 70% (Fig. 5 A), 30 ng of calbindin contained in 30 μg of protein from c5 cells (Fig. 4) should induce an inhibition of about 5%. This difference could be due to loss of some activity of calbindin during the purification process that makes difficult comparing the effects of purified versus c5 cell-derived calbindin. The inhibitory effect of calbindin on caspase-3 activity was apparently unrelated to its calcium binding properties, as chelation of calcium in the reaction buffer by EGTA did not affect the activity of the enzyme. Moreover, the calcium-binding proteins calmodulin, S100, calbindin-D9K, and osteocalcin did not affect caspase-3 activity (Fig. 5 A). Previous studies indicated that calbindin, by buffering calcium, suppresses apoptosis of susceptible cells in the nervous system when induced by agents that increase intracellular calcium, including excitatory amino acids and TNFα (14Guo Q.

Mechanisms involved in this suppression include reduction of oxidative stress and preservation of mitochondrial function (14Guo Q. Christakos S. Robinson N. Mattson M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3227-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It was suggested that calbindin could inhibit the release of cytochromec from the mitochondria, which is needed for the activation of caspase-3, by preventing calcium mediated apoptotic damage of mitochondrial electron transport (14Guo Q. Christakos S. Robinson N. Mattson M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3227-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Cross-talk has been reported between caspases and calpains, a family of calcium-dependent proteases involved in apoptosis (38Wang K.K. Posmantur R. Nadimpalli R. Nath R. Mohan P. Nixon R.A.

Caspase inhibitors have been shown to inhibit calpain activity (38Wang K.K. Posmantur R. Nadimpalli R. Nath R. Mohan P. Nixon R.A. Talanian R.V. Keegan M. Herzog L. Allen H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and both families of proteases share common targets, such as spectrin (39Wang K.K. Posmantur R. Nath R. McGinnis K. Whitton M.

Our studies suggest a more direct effect, since we found that the inhibition of caspase-3 by calbindin was not calcium-dependent. Thus, calbindin may suppress apoptosis by inhibiting the activity of calcium-dependent proteases and by inhibiting caspase-3 via a calcium-independent mechanism. The caspase-3 inhibitors viral p35 (40Bump N.J. Hackett M. Hugunin M. Seshagiri S. Brady K. Chen P. Ferenz C. Franklin S. Ghayur T. Li P.

To determine whether calbindin acts similarly, purified calbindin-D28k was incubated with caspase-3, and the resulting products were resolved by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig.6 A, calbindin-D28kdid not undergo any significant cleavage in the presence of caspase-3 (first and second lanes), whereas gelsolin, a previously demonstrated natural substrate of caspase-3 (43Kothakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A. Tang J. Chu K. McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Koths K. Kwiatkowski D.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1997; 278: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar), was efficiently cleaved under similar conditions (third and fourth lanes). Calbindin-D28k cleavage products were not observed, even after longer incubation in the presence of caspase-3 (30 min or 1 h, not shown). These results suggest that calbindin-D28kdoes not require peptide bond hydrolysis as part of the mechanism of inhibition of caspase-3 activity. This is consistent with the fact that caspase-3 consensus cleavage sites are not found in the amino acid sequence of rat calbindin-D28k (44Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cleavage of gelsolin by caspase-3 was abolished by calbindin-D28k (Fig. 6 A, fifth lane), demonstrating that calbindin-D28k blocks the degradation of both synthetic and natural substrates of caspase-3. As shown for DEVD-CHO degradation (Fig. 5), other calcium proteins, including calmodulin, calbindin-D9k, calretinin, and parvalbunin, did not inhibit the cleavage of gelsolin induced by caspase-3 (not shown). To gain insight into the mechanism by which calbindin inhibits caspase-3 activity, we evaluated the possibility that the two proteins interact by performing an in vitro binding assay. Bacterially expressed GST-calbindin-D28k immobilized in glutathione beads was incubated with purified active caspase-3 and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis using anti-caspase-3 antiserum indicated that indeed caspase-3 bound to GST-calbindin-D28k, but not to control GST beads. These results indicate that inhibition of caspase-3 by calbindin-D28k involves its association with the mature form of caspase-3. Whether calbindin-D28k also binds to the inactive pro-caspase-3 inhibiting its processing will require further studies. Calbindin direct binding to the mature form of caspase-3 resembles the mechanism by which the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family of proteins blocks several caspases (46Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). The peptide aldehyde Ac-DEVD-CHO, a reversible inhibitor of caspase-3, undergoes nucleophilic addition of the cysteine at the catalytic site of caspase-3 to form a hemiacetal (33Nicholson D.W. Ali A.

Whether or not calbindin inhibits caspase-3 by interaction with its active site remains to be determined. Recent evidence has demonstrated that the rate of bone formation is regulated not only by the rate of osteoblast formation but also by the rate of osteoblast apoptosis. Thus, increased osteoblast apoptosis is at least partially responsible for the reduced bone formation in glucocorticoid excess-induced osteopenia (5Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). Conversely, inhibition of osteoblast apoptosis is a likely mechanism of the anabolic effect of intermittent administration of parathyroid hormone (6Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Roberson P.K. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Consistent with the current studies, the inflammatory cytokine TNFα, which inhibits bone formation, collagen synthesis, and alkaline phosphatase (47Stashenko P. Obernesser M.S. Dewhirst F.E. Immunol.

Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 200-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, insulin growth factor I and fibroblast growth factor induce calbindin-D28k expression in neurons and promote neuronal survival (51Collazo D. Takahashi H. McKay R.D. Neuron. 1992; 9: 643-656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 52Nieto-Bona M.P. Busiguina S. Torres-Aleman I. J. Neurosci.

Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of calbindin by these factors suggested a role for calbindin in the process of growth factor-mediated protection against neuronal cell death. Whether the survival effects of insulin growth factor and/or fibroblast growth factor are mediated through increases in calbindin expression in osteoblastic cells will require further studies. In conclusion, the results of the studies reported herein demonstrate for the first time that calbindin-D28k is unique among calcium-binding proteins in its ability to prevent osteoblast apoptosis by interaction and direct inhibition of caspase-3 activity. As opposed to all other reported actions of calbindin-D28k, this effect appears to be independent of the calcium binding capabilities of the protein. Since osteoblastic cells seem to express significant amounts of this calcium binding protein, these observations could be of significance to in vivo bone biology.

For some time it was supposed that mitochondria do not accumulate significant Ca2+ unless the surrounding free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt)1is dangerously high (1Carafoli E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 395-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar, 2Somlyo A.P. Himpens B. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2266-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This view seemed plausible because accumulating Ca2+ would divert energy of the mitochondrial membrane potential from its normal function of producing ATP, and, because the endoplasmic reticulum is already specialized for sequestering and releasing Ca2+, regulation by yet another organelle seemed unnecessary. Nevertheless, in some cells, mitochondria do take up Ca2+ at apparently physiological [Ca2+]cyt levels (<2 μm) (Refs. 3Abercrombie R.F. Hart C.E. Am. J.

Binding of GnRH to its cell surface receptors induces [Ca2+]cytoscillations, driven primarily by the release and re-uptake of Ca2+ from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ stores (for reviews see Refs. 15Stojilkovic S.S. Reinhart J. Catt K.J. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 462-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 16Hille B. Tse A. Tse F.W. Bosma M.M. Recent Prog. Horm.

These [Ca2+]cyt oscillations trigger secretion of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, which are released into the circulation as [Ca2+]cytrises transiently and repetitively above 1 μm. Local [Ca2+]cyt may become even higher at sites of secretion (18Tse F.W. Tse A. Hille B. Horstmann H. Almers W. Neuron. 1997; 18: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Because this dynamic behavior is almost exclusively under control of intracellular organelles, gonadotropes are ideal for examining the relative contribution of intracellular organelles, including mitochondria (19Hehl S. Golard A. Hille B. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), to Ca2+ balance during a physiological response. Cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations in gonadotropes have been fairly well described with a model (20Li Y.X. Rinzel J. Keizer J. Stojilkovic S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) that assumes only two Ca2+ compartments: endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol. The IP3 receptor/Ca2+ channels on the endoplasmic reticulum are first activated by elevated levels of IP3, releasing Ca2+ into the cytosol, and then the IP3 receptor/Ca2+ channels are inhibited (21Kaftan E.J. Ehrlich B.E. Watras J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) by the elevated [Ca2+]cyt. With these Ca2+ channels closed, Ca2+ is pumped back into the endoplasmic reticulum, allowing the channels to recover, and the cycle repeats. The following observations from our laboratory suggest, however, that at least one other compartment is involved: (i) the clearance of Ca2+ from the cytoplasm has an unusual multicomponent time course (22Tse A. Tse F.W. Hille B. J. Physiol. 1994; 477: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), (ii) [Ca2+]cyt clearance was faster than Ca2+ reappearance in the endoplasmic reticulum measured with compartmentalized dye (23Tse F.W. Tse A. Hille B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9750-9754Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and (iii) mitochondrial inhibitors may block Ca2+ oscillations induced by GnRH (19Hehl S. Golard A. Hille B. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Principally by using compartmentalized fluorescent indicators to measure [Ca2+]cyt and [Ca2+]mit simultaneously, this work evaluates quantitatively whether mitochondria are significant players in the cycling of Ca2+ during hormone-induced Ca2+oscillations. Anterior pituitary glands were removed from 4–6-week-old male rats that had been castrated at week 2 by the supplier. Rats were euthanized by placing them in an empty chamber that was then filled with CO2. Tissue was enzymatically dispersed (24Thomas P. Surprenant A. Almers W. Neuron. 1990; 5: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and cells were cultured for up to 4 days. The loading of membrane-permeant Ca2+ indicators, and subsequent photometry was described previously (8Babcock D.F. Herrington J. Goodwin P.C. Park Y.B. Hille B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In experiments where mitochondrial membrane potential was monitored, cells were incubated in TMRE (600 nm) for 5 min following loading with Ca2+ indicators, and TMRE (100 nm) was present in the bath throughout the experiment. Corrections were applied to fluorescence signals to account for bleach and bleed-through of Calcium Green-1 fluorescence into the long wavelength detection channel (8Babcock D.F. Herrington J. Goodwin P.C. Park Y.B. Hille B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensities were converted into free [Ca2+] as described previously (25Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Data are presented as free [Ca2+] in nanomolar, or as ΔF/F, the change in fluorescence ΔF divided by the basal fluorescence F. A correction was also made for the fraction of rhod-2 in the cytosol. The [Ca2+]cyt was calculated from the Calcium Green-1 fluorescence signal. Then a hypothetical cytoplasmic rhod-2 fluorescence was calculated using the time course of [Ca2+]cyt determined from Calcium Green-1. The measured rhod-2 signal was considered to be composed of a cytoplasmic part, behaving as described above, and the mitochondrial part. The assumed fraction of cytoplasmic rhod-2 was then adjusted manually until the corrected rhod-2 fluorescence trace lost the rapid oscillatory falling components that coincided with those seen in the cytoplasmic Calcium Green-1 signal. The dissociation constants for Ca2+ binding to Calcium Green-1 and rhod-2 used for this correction were 190 and 570 nm respectively, and the ratios of maximum to minimum fluorescence, 7.8 and 38, respectively, were determined empirically. The fraction of rhod-2 that remained in the cytoplasm, by this calculation, was typically 30%, but in some experiments it was only 10%. Where appropriate, data are presented as the means ± S.E. Cells were imaged with a Leica TCS-SP/MP inverted confocal microscope equipped with a 100 × 1.3 NA objective. Calcium Green-1 and rhod-2 images were collected sequentially with excitations of 488 and 568 nm, respectively, and merged digitally. Solutions used for whole cell recordings were described earlier (26Shapiro M.S. Hille B. Neuron. 1993; 10: 11-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) except that tetraethyl ammonium chloride replaced NaCl in the bath solution. Membrane capacitance (C m) measurements were performed as described (27Xu T. Ashery U. Burgoyne R.D. Neher E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3293-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 28Gillis K.D. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-channel recording. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 155-197Crossref Google Scholar). To evoke Ca2+entry and exocytosis, 100-ms depolarizations were given to +15 mV at 5 Hz. Currents were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 16.7 kHz. The compound CGP 37157 was obtained from Tocris Cookson, Inc. (Ballwin, MO). Fluorescent probes were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and culture media were from Life Technologies, Inc. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma or Fisher. Our working hypothesis was that a significant fraction of the cellular Ca2+ would be taken up into mitochondria during a period of GnRH-induced Ca2+oscillations. To block this hypothesized mitochondrial contribution to [Ca2+]cyt balance, we added the protonophore CCCP, which should collapse the mitochondrial membrane potential and eliminate the electrical driving force for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Fig. 1 shows that application of CCCP (2 μm) during periodic Ca2+ oscillations dramatically slowed the rate of each downstroke of [Ca2+]cyt and reduced the frequency of oscillation. In this experiment, the rate of fall was 781 ± 43 nm s−1 (n = 7) in the absence of CCCP and 391 ± 47 nms−1 (n = 4) in its presence. In five fully analyzed experiments, the falling phase was slowed 40 ± 6% by adding CCCP. A similar effect was observed in 12 out of 15 cells tested in this manner. In the remaining three cells, CCCP treatment stopped [Ca2+]cyt oscillations completely. In either case, the effect of protonophore was reversible within 30–40 s of washout. The cell in Fig. 1 was exposed to oligomycin-B (2.5 μm) throughout to inhibit the mitochondrial F1-F0 ATPase and thus prevent mitochondrial ATP consumption during CCCP application. Similar results were obtained with or without oligomycin-B, suggesting that the effects of protonophore are not due to a reduction in cytoplasmic ATP. Apparently energized mitochondria mediate about 40% of the Ca2+ clearance that terminates each cycle of physiological Ca2+oscillations. Accumulation of Ca2+ in mitochondria can be measured with Ca2+-sensitive dyes trapped in the mitochondria. Membrane-permeant rhod-2-acetoxymethyl ester has a net positive charge and distributes preferentially into energized mitochondria where it is cleaved and made membrane-impermeant by endogenous esterases (8Babcock D.F. Herrington J. Goodwin P.C. Park Y.B. Hille B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 29Minta A. Kao J.P. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8171-8178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2shows a merged confocal image of a gonadotrope co-loaded with the acetoxymethyl ester forms of Calcium Green-1 and rhod-2. Calcium Green-1 was distributed diffusely in the cytosol, whereas rhod-2 had a more punctate, compartmentalized distribution, as expected from mitochondria. With cells loaded in this way, we could monitor changes of [Ca2+] in the cytosol and in the mitochondria simultaneously. Fig. 3, shows a Calcium Green-1 trace (bottom panel) and two versions of the rhod-2 trace (top panel) during a GnRH application. One rhod-2 trace (A) is corrected for spectral bleed-through (50%) of the Calcium Green-1 fluorescence into the rhod-2 detection band, and the second trace (B) is corrected both for bleed-through and for the fraction of rhod-2 dye estimated to be in the cytosol (35% here; see “Experimental Procedures”). As expected, GnRH (0.5 nm) induced [Ca2+]cytoscillations. The [Ca2+]mit rose simultaneously with global [Ca2+]cyt and continued to increase over the course of 5–10 oscillations. Thus mitochondria accumulate Ca2+ rapidly during GnRH-induced oscillations, and [Ca2+]mit remains elevated for many minutes even after oscillations cease and the [Ca2+]cyt has returned to near basal levels.Figure 3Mitochondria rapidly accumulate Ca2+ during [Ca2+]cytoscillations. Cytoplasmic (Calcium Green-1, bottom panel) and mitochondrial (rhod-2, top panel) signals were recorded from a gonadotrope loaded with both of these two fluorescent Ca2+ indicators. The rhod-2 trace labeledA was corrected only for spectral bleed-through of the Calcium Green-1 fluorescent light into the rhod-2 detection channel, whereas the trace labeled B was also corrected for the fraction of rhod-2 that was trapped in the cytosol (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The inner mitochondrial membrane should be transiently depolarized as Ca2+ flows into the mitochondria. To further test the hypothesis that Ca2+ enters mitochondria during GnRH-induced oscillations, we used a qualitative measure of mitochondrial membrane potential. A large matrix-negative membrane potential allows the fluorescent dye TMRE, a positively charged membrane-permeant molecule, to partition into mitochondria. At bath concentrations in the micromolar range, TMRE accumulates in mitochondria to self-quenching concentrations. As the electrical driving force for TMRE accumulation reduces during mitochondrial membrane depolarization, a fraction of the dye leaves the mitochondria, resulting in a partial relief of self-quench and an increase in fluorescence (11Boitier E. Rea R. Duchen M.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Experiments using TMRE in this way showed that GnRH caused oscillations in the mitochondrial membrane potential and that the mitochondrial depolarizations coincided with each elevation in [Ca2+]cyt (Fig.4). Strong mitochondrial depolarization by application of the protonophore CCCP at the end of these experiments elicited a 7–8-fold larger increase in the TMRE signal as much of the dye was dequenched. These measurements of membrane potential support the conclusion that Ca2+ enters mitochondria electrogenically during each [Ca2+]cytoscillation. Although Ca2+ entered mitochondria rapidly during [Ca2+]cyt elevations, the extrusion of Ca2+ was surprisingly slow. Following applications of GnRH, it took 4–20 min for [Ca2+]mit to return to base line after [Ca2+]cyt had returned to near resting levels. What is the mechanism of this slow Ca2+ extrusion from mitochondria? One possible pathway is the mitochondrial Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, which can be selectively inhibited by the cell-permeant compound CGP-37157 (30Cox D.A. Matlib M.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 408-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To determine the contribution of Na+-Ca2+exchange, gonadotropes loaded with rhod-2 were given three consecutive applications of GnRH at 20-min intervals to allow complete recovery of the rhod-2 signal. The second application was in the presence of 8 μm CGP-37157 (Fig. 5,gray region of trace). The CGP-37157 did not affect the rise of [Ca2+]mit, but it greatly slowed the decline as long as it was present. The apparent increase in the rate of fall of [Ca2+]mit in the “after” trace compared with the “before” trace represents variation between trials because this phenomenon was not consistent among all of the experiments done in this way. In three other experiments in which a comparison was possible at the same [Ca2+]mit(600 nm), CGP-37157 reduced the rate of [Ca2+]mit fall from 8.2 ± 2 nm s−1 to 3.1 ± 1.2 nms−1. Evidently, Na+-Ca2+ exchange is the dominant pathway for Ca2+ extrusion from the mitochondria over this range of [Ca2+]mit. Mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering should be critical in determining the amount of Ca2+ mitochondria can accumulate. We define the intramitochondrial Ca2+ binding ratio as the ratio of change-of-total to change-of-free mitochondrial Ca2+. To estimate this parameter, we compared the change of [Ca2+]mit to the concurrent change of [Ca2+]cyt. This was done under conditions favoring Ca2+ movement from the cytosol to the mitochondria while maintaining other nonmitochondrial Ca2+ transport processes inhibited. To achieve such a state (Fig.6 A), we applied thapsigargin (1 μm) to inhibit Ca2+ uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum and CCCP (2 μm) to limit Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria. While in CCCP, the cell was briefly depolarized with 70 mm KCl to load the cytosol with Ca2+ and then the perfusion medium was immediately switched to one containing La3+, but no Na+ or Ca2+, to prevent further Ca2+ entry and extrusion at the plasma membrane. Mitochondria were then allowed to repolarize and accumulate Ca2+ by removing the CCCP, and the resulting rise in [Ca2+]mit and fall of [Ca2+]cyt were measured. The mitochondrial Ca2+ binding ratio, CBR m, was calculated by the equation, CBRM=CBRc·−Δ[Ca2+]cyt(t2−t1)Δ[Ca2+]mit(t2−t1)·1FmEquation 1 where CBR c is the cytoplasmic Ca2+ binding ratio (taken as 100) (31Tse A. Hille B. Levine J.E. Methods in Neuroscience. 20. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1994: 85-99Google Scholar) andF m is the mitochondrial volume as a fraction of cytoplasmic volume (assumed to be 0.02). Δ[Ca2+]cyt( t 2−t 1)and Δ[Ca2+]mit( t 2−t 1)represent the changes in [Ca2+]cyt and [Ca2+]mit determined during the time interval (t 2 − t 1). In six experiments, the calculated binding ratio ranged widely and averaged 4027 ± 2031. In five of the six experiments, the maximum rate of Ca2+ clearance from the cytoplasm occurred at the same time or a few seconds after the maximum rate of rise of free mitochondrial Ca2+ (Fig. 6 A, inset). One possible explanation is that the intramitochondrial buffer is increasing as Ca2+ enters the mitochondria. To further test this possibility, we monitored the increase in [Ca2+]mit following two successive applications of GnRH (Fig. 6 B). The first application resulted in a rapid and robust increase in [Ca2+]mit, whereas the second application produced a more gradual increase even though the [Ca2+]cyt oscillations were very similar in both cases. The second application of GnRH was intentionally given before the rhod-2 signal was fully recovered to base line. If full recovery was allowed, the [Ca2+]mitaccumulation would appear similar in both cases as in Fig. 5. We have shown that mitochondria take up cytoplasmic Ca2+ as measured by the spatially averaged fluorescence of dyes. Does this uptake have significant local physiological effects? We decided to test whether mitochondria influence the Ca2+dynamics near sites of secretion by using simultaneous measurements of whole cell Ca2+ current, [Ca2+]cyt, and membrane capacitance (C m), an indicator of exocytosis. Trains of depolarizing pulses (100 ms, +15 mV) were applied to gonadotropes at 5 Hz for 2 s to elicit periodic Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. They evoked exocytosis. During the train, the membrane capacitance seemed to rise in two components (Fig. 7 A): the first few pulses mobilized a small (∼20 femtofarad) pool of “immediately releasable” vesicles; then a much larger, second “readily releasable” pool was recruited (32Neher E. Zucker R.S. Neuron. 1993; 10: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 33Horrigan F.T. Bookman R.J. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1119-1129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). CCCP dramatically enhanced the release of the readily releasable pool but not of the immediately releasable pool. Furthermore, the capacitance continued to increase throughout each inter-pulse period in the presence of CCCP, whereas little or no increase was seen in the absence of CCCP during this period (Fig. 7A, compare traces at arrows). Thus, when mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is impaired by the presence of CCCP, [Ca2+]cyt apparently remains high enough to cause continued exocytosis, without simultaneous Ca2+ influx. In three experiments, Calcium Green 5N (100 μm) was included in the pipette to monitor [Ca2+]cyt. The increase in Calcium Green 5N fluorescence during the 2 s depolarizing train (ΔF) was roughly linear, and the resting fluorescence intensity just prior to the train (F) was essentially constant throughout an experiment. CCCP increased this linear rate of rise of ΔF/F during the 2-s depolarizing train by 89 ± 20% (n = 3) relative to same cell controls (data not shown). These effects are not likely due to changes of ATP levels, because in these whole cell experiments the pipette solution contained 2 mm ATP and the bath contained oligomycin-B throughout to block mitochondrial ATP hydrolysis. Examination of Fig.7 B shows that CCCP modestly accelerated the progressive reduction in the Ca2+ current, an effect that would have, by itself, tended to reduce, rather than increase, the amount of exocytosis during the voltage pulses in CCCP. Pituitary gonadotropes are well suited for study of physiologically relevant cellular Ca2+ dynamics. They respond robustly to their natural releasing hormone with periodic elevations of [Ca2+]cyt, the essential stimulus for secretion of gonadotropins. Like skeletal muscle, gonadotropes shuttle Ca2+ among various intracellular compartments during their physiological response instead of relying on significant Ca2+ fluxes across the plasma membrane (16Hille B. Tse A. Tse F.W. Bosma M.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 75-95PubMed Google Scholar,17Kaiser U.B. Conn P.M. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 46-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We show that mitochondria of gonadotropes have a significant role in this physiological Ca2+ response. They take up Ca2+ during hormonally induced [Ca2+]cyt elevations rapidly enough to account for 40% of the Ca2+ clearance from the cytosol during each cycle. When [Ca2+]cyt is approximately 1 μm, the mitochondrial component of clearance lowers [Ca2+]cyt at a rate of 400 nm s−1 and limits the amount of exocytosis. Further, the Ca2+ binding ratio of the mitochondrial matrix averages 40-fold higher than that of the cytosol, so mitochondria contain powerful Ca2+ buffers. Finally, after [Ca2+]cyt returns to resting levels, accumulated Ca2+ is slowly extruded from the mitochondria, with the principal route being the CGP-37157-sensitive mitochondrial Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. These results are in general agreement with previous work on chromaffin cells where we measured clearance rates (7Herrington J. Park Y.B. Babcock D.F. Hille B. Neuron. 1996; 16: 219-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), mitochondrial Ca2+ binding ratios, and the effect of CGP-37157 (8Babcock D.F. Herrington J. Goodwin P.C. Park Y.B. Hille B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In chromaffin cells, mitochondria are the dominant clearance mechanism (84% of clearance), but they too reduce [Ca2+]cyt at rates near 400 nms−1 when [Ca2+]cyt is around 1 μm. Apparently, mitochondria of the two cell types are comparable in their uptake rates and Ca2+ binding ratios, but in gonadotropes, uptake by the endoplasmic reticulum (22Tse A. Tse F.W. Hille B. J. Physiol. 1994; 477: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) is much faster, so that the mitochondrial component is only 40% of the total. In both cells, the mitochondrial Na+-Ca2+exchanger is the principal route for Ca2+ extrusion, but the exchanger in gonadotropes must be 4–10-fold less active because their mitochondria retain Ca2+ much longer. The present results also are in qualitative agreement with our early experiments on gonadotropes showing that CCCP can stop GnRH-induced oscillations and release Ca2+ into the cytosol (19Hehl S. Golard A. Hille B. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Very roughly, our results also fit with classical measurements in isolated heart mitochondria. There the maximum values of Ca2+ and H+ fluxes are given as 10 and 55 μmol g−1s−1, respectively (34Scarpa A. Graziotti P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 62: 756-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 35Penniston J.T. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 650-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), referred to dry protein. With conversion factors summarized by Scarpa (36Scarpa A. Giebisch G. Tosteson D.C. Ussing H.H. Transport across Single Biological Membranes. 2. Springer-Verlag, New York1979: 263-347Crossref Google Scholar), the Ca2+ influx would become 7 mmol l−1s−1, referred to cardiac mitochondrial volume. If we take the mitochondrial volume of gonadotrope as 2% of the cell and the cytoplasmic Ca2+ binding ratio as 100, this maximal flux of cardiac mitochondria could reduce [Ca2+]cyt at a rate of 1.4 μms−1, quite compatible with rates we measure in gonadotropes. Now consider the mitochondrial depolarization. We view the large inside-negative mitochondrial membrane potential as the result of a steady electric current of proton export working across a very poor conductor, the mitochondrial inner membrane. Calcium uptake is also a current and reduces the membrane potential by momentarily canceling some fraction of the oppositely directed proton current. (As we saw above, these two maximal values are similar.) When Ca2+influx stops, the proton current repolarizes the mitochondrial membrane potential without delay. The Ca2+ uptake-induced mitochondrial depolarization that we report (Fig. 4) gives only 14% of the large increase in TMRE fluorescence obtained with strong depolarization by CCCP. Considering that by the Nernst equation a depolarization of only 18 mV would change the TMRE distribution ratio 2-fold, we can argue that this Ca2+ uptake depolarizes by only few millivolts. Thus, a Ca2+ uptake sufficient to have a significant impact on Ca2+ oscillations and exocytosis and large enough to be detected by TMRE makes but a small reduction in the −150 to −180 mV membrane potential of energized mitochondria. We have reported here spatially averaged optical measurements. Very likely there are gradients within the cytosol and heterogeneity among mitochondria (37Monteith G.R. Blaustein M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1193-C1204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Pivovarova N.B. Hongpaisan J. Andrews S.B. Friel D.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6372-6384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so some quantitative relationships are not well resolved. For example, the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria may have a special spatial relationship that allows more efficient mitochondrial removal of Ca2+ released from the endoplasmic reticulum (39Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). Our lab has shown that the local [Ca2+] near sites of exocytosis is higher than the spatially averaged value during GnRH-induced oscillations (18Tse F.W. Tse A. Hille B. Horstmann H. Almers W. Neuron. 1997; 18: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and here we have shown that mitochondria take up Ca2+ near sites of exocytosis. Hence, the mitochondrial uptake we measure may be rapid because it occurs in regions where the [Ca2+] is considerably higher than the averages reported by our dyes. Using ideas described in other cells (33Horrigan F.T. Bookman R.J. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1119-1129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 40Neher E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 41Voets T. Neher E. Moser T. Neuron. 1999; 23: 607-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) for explaining our voltage step experiments, the immediately releasable pool of secretory ganules may be those docked vesicles that are near to voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and the readily releasable pool may be additional vesicles that are docked farther from the Ca2+ channels. When mitochondria are fully functional (no CCCP), they would limit the diffusional range of Ca2+, so little spreads beyond the immediately releasable pool. However, when CCCP is present, the Ca2+ can spread to the readily releasable pool, and more vesicles are discharged over a longer period of time. It should be noted that voltage step protocol used to induce exocytosis in experiments like those in Fig. 7 might not accurately reflect hormonally induced exocytosis, because the physiological source of Ca2+ is from IP3-gated stores and not voltage-gated stores. Our attempts to measure the effects of CCCP on GnRH-induced exocytosis were prevented by the large, uncontrollable [Ca2+]cyt oscillations that occur following stimulation. These oscillations result in a large mitochondrial Ca2+ load that is partially released by the addition of CCCP, which then raises [Ca2+]cyt. The voltage protocol used in Fig.7 allows a short and relatively small addition of a known amount of Ca2+ (from current records) to the system. Here the mitochondria do not take on a large Ca2+ load, and same cell comparisons of changes in capacitance are possible. One surprising observation was that in experiments like that of Fig.6 A, the rise of [Ca2+]mit leveled off while [Ca2+]cyt was still falling. One possible explanation, which we propose as a working hypothesis, is that the intramitochondrial buffer is dynamic, increasing as more Ca2+ ions are bound. This is supported by experiments like that in Fig. 6 B, where the increase in [Ca2+]mit is greatly slowed during a second challenge with GnRH. The increase in intramitochondrial buffering could occur (i) if a chelating anion such as phosphate were transported in while Ca2+ enters, (ii) if insoluble Ca2+ salts formed in the mitochondrial matrix (38Pivovarova N.B. Hongpaisan J. Andrews S.B. Friel D.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6372-6384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42David G. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7495-7506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or (iii) if a rise in intramitochondrial pH enhanced the degree of ionization of the mitochondrial buffers. Consistent with a pH dependence for buffering, we observed an initial transient rise of [Ca2+]mit when CCCP was applied (Fig.6 A). We attribute this rise to acidification of the matrix and weakening of their Ca2+ buffers. Whatever the details of local gradients and intramitochondrial buffering, the mitochondrial uptake of Ca2+ suffices to have a significant impact on physiological Ca2+ oscillations and on exocytosis.

Stienmier."
https://openalex.org/W1549205437,"Native Cu,Zn-SOD and synthetic SOD mimics sometimes demonstrate an apparently anomalous bell-shaped dose-response relationship when protecting various biological systems from oxidative stress. Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for such an effect, including: overproduction of H(2)O(2), peroxidative activity of SOD, and opposing roles played by O(2)(*-) in both initiation and termination of radical chain reactions. In the present study, ferrocyanide and thiols, which are susceptible to one-electron and two-electron oxidation, respectively, were subjected to a flux of superoxide in the presence and absence of SOD or SOD mimics. The results show that 1) either O(2)(*-)/HO(2)(*) or H(2)O(2) alone partially inactivates papain, whereas when combined they act synergistically; 2) nitroxide SOD mimics, but not SOD, exhibit a bell-shaped dose-response relationship in protecting papain from inactivation; 3) SOD, which at low dose inhibits superoxide-induced oxidation of ferrocyanide, loses its antioxidative effect as its concentration increases. These findings offer an additional explanation for the pro-oxidative activity of SOD and SOD mimics without invoking any dual activity of O(2)(*-) or a combined effect of SOD and H(2)O(2). The most significant outcome of an increase in SOD level is a decrease of [O(2)(*-)](steady state), rather than any notable elevation of [H(2)O(2)](steady state). As a result, the reaction kinetics of the high oxidation state of each catalyst is altered. In the presence of ultra-low [O(2)(*-)](steady state), the oxidized form of SOD [Cu(II),Zn-SOD] or SOD mimic (oxo-ammonium cation) does not react with O(2)(*-) but rather oxidizes the target molecule that it was supposed to have protected. Consequently, these catalysts exert an anti- or pro-oxidative effect depending on their concentration."

Smoothened Sonic hedgehog Patched fibroblast-conditioned medium Smoothened (Smo),1 a protein with homology to G-protein-coupled receptors, was first identified in Drosophila as a necessary component for Hedgehog signaling and shown to be involved in pattern formation and morphogenesis (1Nusslein-Volhard C.

Epstein Jr., E.H. de Sauvage F.J. Nature. 1998; 391: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Smo is known to be constitutively active in the absence of Ptc, and its third intracellular loop and seventh transmembrane region are required for function (11Murone M. Rosenthal A. de Sauvage F.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 76-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, Smo has yet to be shown to interact with a G-protein, and the identity of the pathway used for downstream communication is unclear (12Alcedo J. Noll M. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 583-590PubMed Google Scholar,13Ingham P.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3505-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Because detection of a G-protein-coupled response from Smo in transfected mammalian cells has been elusive, we were prompted to examine its effect using a frog melanophore-based assay. Melanophores provide a sensitive, quantitative bioassay for the activity of G-protein-coupled receptors (14Potenza M.N. Lerner M.R. Pigm. Cell Res. 1992; 5: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The state of pigment distribution within a cell reflects intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) or diacylglycerol. Elevation of either cAMP or diacylglycerol above baseline induces melanosome dispersion throughout the cytoplasm, whereas inhibition of cAMP production (in the absence of additional diacylglycerol production) is associated with melanosome aggregation into a single, centrally located sphere. The melanophore assay is particularly useful as a means of identifying Gαi-coupled receptors, such as the human D3receptor, whose ability to lower intracellular cAMP levels is barely noticeable when heterologously expressed (15Potenza M.N. Graminski G.F. Schmauss C. Lerner M.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1463-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, it is demonstrated that Xenopus melanophores expressing Smo display persistent aggregation, a hallmark of Gαi activity. Either pertussis toxin (PTX) or a dominant negative Gαi, but not a dominant negative Gαo, can reverse the phenotype. The results show that Smoothened can signal via activation of Gαi. The human cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) was the kind gift of Merck Frosst. Plasmid pRK7 containing the human Smo, Ptc, and mouse Shh genes and purified, recombinant N-Shh (5Stone D.M. Hynes M.

The coding sequences were subcloned into either pCR3.1 Uni (Smo) or pcDNA3.1/V5/His-TOPO (Gαi and Gαo) vectors from Invitrogen for expression in melanophores. Gαo Q205L and S47C were constructed using the Transformer Mutagenesis kit from Promega. The β2-7 cell line ofXenopus melanophores, obtained from Bunsen Rush Laboratories, Inc., was propagated as described in fibroblast-conditioned medium (CFM) (14Potenza M.N. Lerner M.R. Pigm. Cell Res. 1992; 5: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected by electroporation using an Electro Cell Manipulator 600 (BTX) as described with the following changes (16Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). A constant amount of DNA (40 μg) consisting of plasmid and sheared salmon sperm DNA carrier (Life Technologies, Inc.) dissolved in 10 μl of 10 mm Tris-EDTA, pH 7.5, was added to 1 × 106 cells suspended in 400 μl of 70% phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0. The resulting mix was incubated on ice for 20 min in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and twice vortexed gently during this period. The cells were triturated with a micropipettor, transferred to a prechilled 2-mm gap cuvette, and electroporated at settings of 450 microfarads, 475 V, and 720 ohms. Cells were resuspended in 6 ml of CFM containing 100 nm melanocyte stimulating hormone and 5 mg/ml insulin, plated in T 25 flasks and allowed to attach for 3 h. Flasks were rinsed with 70% phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, to remove dead cells, trypsinized with 0.3 ml of 0.5× trypsin-EDTA, and resuspended in 10 ml of CFM containing melanocyte stimulating hormone and insulin. Cells were plated in 96-well half-area plates at 100% confluence for microplate assays and at 10% confluence in 6-well plates (Costar) pretreated with Cell-Tak (Collaborative Research) for manual counting. Microplate assays measuring the mean Gαi-dependent aggregation of melanophore pigment were performed as described (17Potenza M.N. Gold S.J. Roby-Shemkowitz A. Lerner M.R. Nestler E.J. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 482-491PubMed Google Scholar) with the following changes. 24 h following plating, medium was removed and replaced with 100 μl of serum-free 70% L-15 medium (L-15, Sigma). Cells were incubated in white light for 1 h, and 11 μl of l-15 containing ten times the final concentration of ligands was added and designated as time zero. Absorbance at 650 nm was immediately measured on a Molecular Dynamics V max microplate reader using the SOFTmax program. Cells were exposed to white light for 30 min, and final absorbances were measured. To determine the ratio of cells with aggregated versus dispersed pigment, fields of cells in 6-well plates were examined using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope at 20× magnification under bright field optics. 24 h following plating, complete medium was removed and replaced withl-15, and cells were incubated in white light for 1 h. 3–10 fields, containing a total of 250–300 cells, were randomly chosen and photographed to calculate the percentage of cells with aggregated pigment for each data point. Cells were either scored as aggregated (round) or dispersed (stellate). Experiments were repeated at least three times, and error bars show standard errors of the means. PTX from List Biological Labs Inc. was reconstituted according to the supplier's instructions. β2-7 melanophores were electroporated with 10 μg of Smo and 30 μg of salmon sperm DNA, 10 μg of CB2 receptor plasmid and 30 μg of salmon sperm DNA, or 40 μg of salmon sperm DNA alone (control). Transfected cells were plated as described above in Cell-Tak-coated 96-well plates (Corning). After an overnight incubation at 30 °C in the dark, cells were exposed to white light for 1 h in the incubator. Absorbance was measured at time zero, and compounds were added to wells to give a final concentration of 5 μg/ml PTX, 100 nm HU210 (CB2 receptor agonist), and 10 nm melatonin. Plates were returned to the illuminated incubator, and additional readings were taken every hour. Transfection efficiency was assayed by cotransfection with 4 μg of a lacZ-encoding plasmid (15Potenza M.N. Graminski G.F. Schmauss C. Lerner M.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1463-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lim K. Chae C.B. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). 24 h following plating, medium was removed and replaced with L-15. Cells were exposed to white light for 1 h, fixed, and incubated in β-galactosidase assay buffer for 24 h. 40–70% of cells consistently exhibited blue color. Because Smo is constitutively active in the absence of the inhibitory co-receptor Ptc, its expression in melanophores would be expected to lead to a phenotype of persistent pigment dispersion if it coupled to either Gαs or Gαq. Alternatively, pigment aggregation would be expected to occur if Smo coupled to Gαi. 10 μg of the plasmid pCR3.1 Uni containing wild type human Smo cDNA (Smo) (Fig.1, A and B), or pCR3.1 Uni vector control (Fig. 1, C and D) were transfected into Xenopus melanophores and placed in the dark. 24 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced with L-15 and the plates were returned to the dark for 1 h. The melanophores were then immediately photographed (Fig. 1, A andC), exposed to white light for 1 h, and rephotographed (Fig. 1, B and D). Unlike some other melanophore cell lines, the β2–7 cells used in these experiments remain mostly dispersed in the dark, and light causes only a 12% increase in overall darkening (data not shown) (19Provencio I. Jiang G. De Grip W.J. Par Hayes Rollag M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 20Daniolos A. Lerner A.B. Lerner M.R. Pigm. Cell Res. 1990; 3: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Whereas a few cells in the plate that received Smo did disperse their pigment in response to light (not shown), >90% showed the phenotype of pigment aggregation both before (Fig. 1 A) and after (Fig. 1 B) exposure to light. Meanwhile, all of the cells in the plate that received only control vector maintained the pigment dispersed state both before (Fig.1 C) and after photostimulation (Fig. 1 D). Because the only pathway known to induce pigment aggregation in melanophores is via Gαi signaling, PTX, an inhibitor of both Gαi and Gαo (21Gilman A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4669) Google Scholar), was applied following transfection with Smo (Fig. 2). Twenty-four hours after electroporation, the plate was treated with 5 μg/ml PTX and exposed to white light (Fig. 2 A). Absorbance measurements were obtained at hourly intervals in the continued presence of photostimulation. For the first 4 h, no changes in pigment distribution were observed in either the PTX-treated cells or the controls that did not receive PTX. After that time, and for the rest of the 9-h experiment, the PTX-treated cells displayed increasing pigment dispersion, as determined by a sustained increase in absorption, whereas the control cells remained unchanged. As additional tests, melanophores were transfected with either salmon sperm DNA or a vector coding for the human CB2 that is known to function via activation of Gαi (22Howlett A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 27: 429-436PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, Band C). To wells containing salmon sperm DNA-transfected cells (Fig. 2 B) 5 μg/ml PTX was added with or without 10 nm melatonin, which activates the endogenous Gαi-linked melatonin receptor. In the first hour, melatonin-treated cells aggregated their pigment, as determined by a decrease in absorbance, whether or not PTX was present. Over the subsequent 8 h, the PTX-treated cells showed continued pigment dispersion, whereas the ones that received only melatonin kept their melanosomes tightly aggregated. The reason for the more rapid response to PTX by sham-transfected cells that received melatonin compared with Smo-transfected cells is not known. However, because of the robustness of the cytomegalovirus promoter used to drive Smo expression, one possibility is that the number of Smo molecules expressed on the cell surface is greater then that of the native melatonin receptor. This could increase the amount of time required for the PTX to inhibit a comparable number of G-proteins in the Smo experiment, compared with the melatonin one, to negate the receptor-mediated pigment aggregation signal. As additional controls, melatonin was withheld, and the effect of PTX alone was examined. Here, PTX was ineffective at inducing additional pigment dispersion above the starting base line, as was also the case for melanophores that saw neither PTX nor melatonin. As a further test, cells transfected with the CB2 receptor were given 100 nm of the CB2 receptor agonist, HU210, with or without the simultaneous addition of PTX (Fig. 2 C). Cells that received HU210 alone showed a steady decrease in absorbance, indicative of pigment aggregation, throughout the 9-h experiment. Meanwhile, cells that received both HU210 and PTX showed a decrease in absorbance for the first 4 h. Thereafter, as with the case for Smo-expressing cells, increasing pigment dispersion was observed. As additional controls, the effect of PTX on CB2 receptor-transfected cells that were not given HU210 was tested. Melanophores that received neither HU210 nor PTX had no observable change in their pigment distribution throughout the experiment. However, those that received PTX responded with an increase in absorbance above the baseline beginning at 4 h. This latter effect is most easily explained by the possibility that, in melanophores, the CB2 receptor shows a small amount of constitutive activity. PTX induced reversal of Smo, melatonin, and CB2 receptor-mediated melanosome aggregation. This is consistent with the hypothesis that Smo acts via Gαi. However, whereas only Gαi activation is known to engender pigment aggregation, PTX can also inhibit Gαo and, until now, it has not been known what effect Gαo activation would have on pigment aggregation. To determine whether Gαi and/or Gαo could contribute to Smo-mediated pigment aggregation, two experiments were conducted. Because receptor-mediated Gαi activation is known to cause pigment aggregation, it was expected that expression of a constitutively active Gαi would have such an effect. This was confirmed by electroporation with several concentrations of a mutant Gαi vector that is always active, GαiQ204H. 24 h following the electroporation and plating in 6-well plates, the medium was changed to L-15, and the cells were exposed to light for 1 h. The numbers of cells found to have aggregatedversus dispersed pigment were determined by examining and tallying individual cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As seen in Fig.3 A, there was a dose-dependent relationship between the amount of vector applied and the percentage of resulting cells that had aggregated pigment. With regard to Gαo, although melanophores contain an endogenous protein (data not shown), its contribution to pigment distribution following receptor-mediated stimulation has been obscure. To evaluate the potential for Gαo stimulation to mediate pigment movement, constitutively active Gαo Q205L was introduced into the pigment cells. As with active Gαi, Gαo also produced dose-dependent persistent pigment aggregation (Fig. 3 A). Because PTX reversed Smo-mediated melanosome aggregation while either constitutively active Gαi or Gαo were found to be independently capable of inducing aggregation, the specific contributions of Gαi and Gαo to the Smo effect were tested. A dominant negative Gαi (23Slepak V.Z. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4037-4041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and a dominant negative Gαo were coexpressed with Smo in melanophores. In the absence of Smo, over 90% of the melanophores had dispersed pigment, regardless of whether dominant negative Gαi or Gαo was present (Fig.3 B). However, 30 μg of the dominant negative Gαi S47N largely blocked the ability of 10 μg of Smo to induce pigment aggregation, whereas an identical quantity of vector coding for the dominant negative Gαo S47C had no effect. Since only the dominant negative Gαi could prevent Smo-induced pigment aggregation, the Gαi effect was examined in more detail (Fig. 3, C and D). Increasing the amount of Smo from 1 to 16 μg led to increased pigment aggregation up to a maximum value of 47% (Fig. 3 C). Because the electroporation efficiency in these experiments was on the order of 70% by β-galactosidase staining (not shown), the 47% value means that 67% of electroporated cells experienced pigment aggregation. Cells cotransfected with Smo and Gαi S47N also showed an increase in the numbers of cells with pigment aggregation but the effect was more modest, with a maximum of 17% of the total or 24% of the electroporated ones. Expression of Gαi S47N was therefore able to block Smo-mediated aggregation by about 64%. Similarly, 30 μg of Gαi S47N cotransfected with 4 μg of CB2 receptor was able to block HU210-induced aggregation by 58% (data not shown). Next, cotransfection was carried out where the amount of dominant negative Gαi used during transfection varied in the presence of a constant 10 μg of Smo (Fig.3 D). Here, the dominant negative Gαi reversed Smo-induced aggregation, again in a dose-dependent manner. 10 μg of 6-His Gαi1 S47N, an α-subunit that is nonfunctional in vivo because of lack of myristoylation (16Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), was also tested for its ability to inhibit Smo-induced aggregation and was found to be ineffective (Fig. 3 D). In its native environment, Smo is held in check by the co-receptor, Ptc. To determine if this aspect of Smo regulation is correctly preserved during expression in melanophores, a Ptc·Smo co-expression experiment was conducted (Fig.4 A). 10 μg of the Smo vector was electroporated into melanophores along with 0–10 μg of vector containing an insert coding for human Ptc. As expected, in the absence of Ptc ∼55% of the cells showed pigment aggregation, reflecting the efficiency of transfection by electroporation. However, the addition of 0.5 μg of the Ptc vector to the transfection resulted in a greater than 50% reduction in the number of pigment-aggregated cells, to ∼25% of the total. Further increases in the amount of the Ptc vector introduced during electroporation led to a progressively greater reversal of Smo-induced pigment aggregation, and in the presence of 5 μg or more, Smo activity was abolished. Neither a vector control transfection nor one carried out with Ptc alone led to cells displaying pigment aggregation (Fig. 4 A). Melatonin, which operates on the endogenous melatonin receptor, was not inhibited from effecting Gαi-mediated melanosome aggregation by Ptc (data not shown). Therefore, Ptc expression per se did not prevent Gαi-mediated pigment aggregation. To confirm that the Ptc·Smo receptor complex as a whole also maintained its normal signaling capability when expressed by melanophores, a triple co-expression experiment was conducted using plasmids coding for Shh, Ptc, and Smo (Fig. 4 B). 10 μg each of Ptc and Smo-expressing plasmids were electroporated into cells along with 0–10 μg of a plasmid whose expression induces Shh secretion from the cells. As previously shown in Fig. 4 A, in the absence of Shh, the percentage of cells found in the pigment-aggregated state was again minimal. However, the addition of 1 μg of the Shh plasmid to the electroporation led to a greater than 50% reestablishment of the number of cells found to have aggregated pigment, compared with cells expressing only Smo. Further addition of Shh vector resulted in full restoration of the percentage of pigment-aggregated cells compared with either the expression of Smo alone or Smo plus Shh but absent of Ptc. As expected, Shh expression alone did not induce pigment aggregation. The cells electroporated with only the Shh vector also retained their ability to aggregate pigment in response to melatonin (data not shown). The above experiments demonstrate that the Ptc·Smo receptor complex can be established and is functional in melanophores. They also demonstrate that Smo activation leads to Gαi-mediated signaling. However, the phenotype of pigment aggregation occurred following continuous Smo activity, and Smo is known to induce the transcription of various proteins such as Gli1. Therefore it was possible that the observed Gαiactivation was an indirect effect, resulting from the induction of transcription and translation of a secondary protein(s) that in turn activated Gαi. To rule out this possibility, Shh protein produced in Escherichia coli was applied to melanophores that co-expressed Ptc and Smo. 15 μg of Ptc and 30 μg of Smo were introduced into cells by electroporation, and the cells were plated at a density of 5000 cells/well in 96-well microtiter plates. Following an overnight incubation in CFM, cells were exposed to light for 1 h. Then, in the continuous presence of light, Shh was added to the wells to achieve a concentration of 3 μg/ml, and the time course of the pigment aggregation response was determined over the subsequent 30 min (Fig. 5 A). Within 5 min, pigment aggregation was seen as measured by a decrease in absorbance compared with cells that did not see Shh. The difference between the Shh and non-Shh-treated cells became increasingly evident throughout the test. By comparison, melatonin induced noticeable pigment aggregation within 1 min. As an additional set of controls, cells electroporated with pCR3.1 Uni were also evaluated for their ability to aggregate pigment in response to Shh and melatonin (Fig.5 B). Here, whereas melatonin again induced pigment aggregation, Shh had no effect. The results show that Smo has the hallmarks of a G-protein-coupled receptor, consistent with its known sequence homology to other 7-transmembrane receptors. The constitutive activity in melanophores is also consistent with the current model for Smo function, wherein activity is seen in the absence of the inhibitory co-receptor, Ptc. The simplest interpretation of the results is that Smo interacts directly with Gαi. However, to rule out the possibility of an unknown intermediary protein common to melanophores, keratinocytes, and other cells in which Smo functions, additional experiments would be necessary to show that Smo directly activates G-protein nucleotide exchange in membrane preparations. Coupling to Gαi in pigment cells probably is recapitulated in vivo within basal keratinocytes and other cell types for four reasons. First, over 100 different G-protein-coupled receptors have been expressed in melanophores in our laboratory and by others without any failures. In all cases, the mechanism of coupling has faithfully reproduced those observed in their natural environments (15Potenza M.N. Graminski G.F. Schmauss C. Lerner M.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1463-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Potenza M.N. Gold S.J. Roby-Shemkowitz A. Lerner M.R. Nestler E.J. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 482-491PubMed Google Scholar). Second, injection of mRNA encoding PTX into zebrafish embryos affects their development consistent with a role for Gαi in the Hedgehog signaling pathway (24Hammerschmidt M. McMahon A.P. Dev. Biol. 1998; 194: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Third, another Frizzled family member, rat Frizzled-2, stimulates the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway and protein kinase C via a PTX-sensitive G-protein (25Slusarski D.C. Corces V.G. Moon R.T. Nature. 1997; 390: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 26Sheldahl L.C. Park M. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Fourth, although Gαo activity was demonstrated to be capable of inducing pigment aggregation, a dominant negative Gαo did not prevent Smo-mediated aggregation. The findings lead to the suggestion that at least some of the 45% of basal cell carcinomas whose Ptc and Smo proteins are fully functional may harbor defects in Gαi or downstream components of the Gαi-regulated pathways. Inhibitors targeted to specific aspects of Gαi signaling systems may offer chemical therapies for basal cell carcinomas. Inappropriate activation of Gαi pathways is seen in tumors arising in tissues other than skin, including human adrenal cortex, ovary, and brain (27Farfel Z. Bourne H.R. Iiri T. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar,28Sehgal A. Ricks S. Boynton A.L. Warrick J. Murphy G.P. J. Surg. Oncol. 1998; 69: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The experiments conducted in our study also demonstrate that the Ptc·Smo receptor complex, which initiates Shh signaling, can be reconstituted as a fully functional entity in the heterologous melanophore. As in its normal environment, the unliganded receptor complex shows no activity in melanophores as measured by the lack of Smo-mediated pigment aggregation, and this effect is sensitive to the amount of Ptc present in the cells. Further, the addition of Shh to the system overcomes the Ptc-controlled Smo blockade just as it can in tissues that normally contain Ptc and Smo. Finally, the ability of Shh protein to induce pigment aggregation in Ptc·Smo-expressing cells within 5 min rules out the need for new protein synthesis for Smo-mediated Gαi activation. The results indicate that melanophores present a simple visual means for studying how Shh, Ptc, Smo, and Gαi interact. We hope that in the future, the assay will help provide a more detailed understanding of the workings of the Shh signal transduction pathway at the level of the cell membrane.

https://openalex.org/W1574082488,"NCC27 belongs to a family of small, highly conserved, organellar ion channel proteins. It is constitutively expressed by native CHO-K1 and dominantly localized to the nucleus and nuclear membrane. When CHO-K1 cells are transfected with NCC27-expressing constructs, synthesized proteins spill over into the cytoplasm and ion channel activity can then be detected on the plasma as well as nuclear membrane. This provided a unique opportunity to directly compare electrophysiological characteristics of the one cloned channel, both on the nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes. At the same time, as NCC27 is unusually small for an ion channel protein, we wished to directly determine whether it is a membrane-resident channel in its own right. In CHO-K1 cells transfected with epitope-tagged NCC27 constructs, we have demonstrated that the NCC27 conductance is chloride dependent and that the electrophysiological characteristics of the channels are essentially identical whether expressed on plasma or nuclear membranes. In addition, we show that a monoclonal antibody directed at an epitope tag added to NCC27 rapidly inhibits the ability of the expressed protein to conduct chloride, but only when the antibody has access to the tag epitope. By selectively tagging either the amino or carboxyl terminus of NCC27 and varying the side of the membrane from which we record channel activity, we have demonstrated conclusively that NCC27 is a transmembrane protein that directly forms part of the ion channel and, further, that the amino terminus projects outward and the carboxyl terminus inward. We conclude that despite its relatively small size, NCC27 must form an integral part of an ion channel complex."

Recently, a bacterial Na+-dependent galactose/glucose cotransporter of the SGLT family has been cloned and characterized from Vibrio parahaemolyticus (22Sarker R.I. Okabe Y. Tsuda M. Tsuchiya T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1281: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 23Sarker R.I. Ogawa W. Shimamoto T. Tsuchiya T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial expression circumvents the oocyte trafficking problem by direct translocation into the plasma membrane and permits large scale protein purification. The Vibrio ortholog, which we term vSGLT, is thus more amenable to molecular analysis, which makes it an advantageous model for structure/function studies. The plasmid pYAT271A bears a genomic fragment carrying the vSGLT(SglS) gene from V. parahaemolyticus (23Sarker R.I. Ogawa W. Shimamoto T. Tsuchiya T. J.

The full vSGLT coding region was then inserted after the l-arabinose-inducible pBAD promoter in the pBAD18 vector (24Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3886) Google Scholar) and immediately downstream of a 44-base pair T7 phage phi10 ribosome binding region. A sequence encoding a 10-residue C-terminal spacer and six histidines (VLYKSGGSPGHHHHHH; His tag) was appended by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (25Aiyar A. Leis J. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 366-369PubMed Google Scholar). A fusion of vSGLT and green fluorescent protein (GFP)1 has been expressed also (VNGFPH6). In this construct, the vSGLT C terminus is fused to a fifteenth membrane span sequence NCDAEITLIIFGVMAGVIGTILLISYGIRRLIK (human glycophorin A membrane span is underlined), which is fused to a bright GFP variant minus the Met initiator (Maxygen, Palo Alto, CA) (26Crameri A. Whitehorn E.A. Tate E. Stemmer W.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar), terminating in SGGSPGHHHHHH. Sequencing assured the fidelity of constructs. Pilot experiments to optimize conditions for expression and purification exploited the fluorescence of VNGFPH6. VNH6A and VNGFPH6 were expressed inEscherichia coli strain XL1Blue (Stratagene) in 34 mm KH2PO4, 49 mmK2HPO4, 20 mm(NH4)2SO4, 0.3 mmMgSO4, 1% Bacto-Tryptone, and Fe2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+ at 2, 10, and 1 μm, respectively. VNH6A expression was induced at 33 μml-arabinose during overnight growth, at ∼27 °C, using 2 liters of medium inoculated with 60 OD units of frozen cells. Cells were pelleted 10 min at 3000 × g and resuspended in 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris·Cl, pH 8.1, 5 mm Na3EDTA, 20% (w/v) sucrose. Hen lysozyme was added to 1 mg/ml, and the addition of one volume of water induced mild osmotic shock (27Witholt B. Boekhout M. Brock M. Kingma J. Heerikhuizen H.V. Leij L.D. Anal.

Cell debris and DNA were precipitated with 6 mm spermine and pelleted at 27,000 × g for 5 min. Cold supernatant was filtered through 0.2-μm nylon and applied to a 7-ml bed (1-cm diameter) of Ni2+ chelate resin (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; Qiagen) at 3 ml/min using fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed at 1.5 ml/min at 22 °C with 4 bed volumes of buffer N (50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na3·citrate, 20 mmgalactose, 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% C12M) and then washed at 1 ml/min with the indicated bed volumes and supplements in buffer N: 20 mm imidazole, 4 volumes; 40 mmimidazole, 4 volumes; 20 mm imidazole plus 500 mm NaCl, 1.5 volumes; 20 mm imidazole, 1.5 volumes. His-tagged protein was eluted with 250 mmimidazole in buffer N. His-tagged protein fractions were pooled, made 10 mm in EDTA, and concentrated to <0.25 ml by ultrafiltration in Centricon YM50 devices (Millipore). Retentate was centrifuged to pellet any aggregates and then applied to a 1 × 30 cm Superose R12 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer N, 0.2 mm EDTA. The column, pre-calibrated with globular proteins, was developed at 0.2 ml/min. Fractions of purified protein were pooled, made 15% (v/v) in glycerol, and stored at 4 °C. Purified protein was precipitated with CHCl3/MeOH (29Whitelegge J.P. le Coutre J. Lee J.C. Engel C.K. Privé G.G. Faull K.F. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10695-10698Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), dissolved in 88% formic acid, separated from lipid and detergent by HPLC in organic solvent, and analyzed by ESI-MS (30le Coutre J.

Proteoliposomes (PLs) were made using β-cyclodextrin (31Degrip W.J. Vanoostrum J. Bovee-Geurts P.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Lipids were prepared by dissolving 30 mg of Asolectin soy lecithin (Associated Concentrates, Woodside, NY) and 10 mg of cholesterol in diethyl ether and drying under N2and then under vacuum at 37 °C. Lipids were suspended in 2.5 ml of buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm Tricine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na12phytate, 0.01% Me2SO, pH 8.1), sonicated 20 min, and stored at −80 °C. Lipid/detergent/protein mixtures were made at 22 °C. 30 μl of emulsified lipid, 50 μl of 10% C10M, and 250 μl of 2× KG buffer (20 mm Tris, 20 mm HEPES, 300 mmKCl, 200 mm choline·Cl, and 20% glycerol) were combined and incubated for 5 min. Undissolved lipid was removed by centrifugation. Purified VNH6A (2.5 μg in 170 μl) was added and incubated for 5 min. 5 μl of a mixture of 100 mm each MgCl2 and CaCl2 was added and incubated for 5 min. PLs formed upon addition of 270 μl of CD2 (60 mmβ-cyclodextrin, 15% formamide in 1× KG buffer) in 10-μl aliquots, mixing after each addition. PLs were incubated 5 min and then desalted on a 7-ml bed of Superdex 30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 1 cm in diameter, in buffer W2 (10 mm Tris, 10 mmHEPES, 150 mm KCl, 3 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 0.5 ml/min. Desalted PLs were pelleted at 400,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Proteoliposome pellets for sugar uptake assays were resuspended in 200 μl of buffer W2 with a 28G needle and stored at −80 °C. PLs were thawed and subjected to three more freeze/thaw cycles in liquid N2 before assay at 22 °C. Uptake was initiated by mixing 10 μl of PLs and 10 μl of buffer 2× U ([14C]d-galactose, 200 mmcholine·Cl plus NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 20 mmHEPES, 300 mm KCl, 6 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2). Each reaction was stopped with 1 ml of cold buffer RIN (10 mm Tris, 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm KCl, 50 mm choline·Cl, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2) applied centrally to a 0.22-μm nitrocellulose filter type GSWP (Millipore) over vacuum and washed with 4 ml of cold RIN, and the filter was assayed by scintillation counting. For freeze fracture EM of large vesicles, PL pellets were freeze/thawed twice in liquid N2, resuspended in 20 μl of buffer W2, and then freeze/thawed twice more. After 16 h at 4 °C, they were prepared for freeze fracture (32Zampighi G.A. Hall J.E. Kreman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8468-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Particle densities and dimensions were determined (33Eskandari S. Wright E.M. Kreman M. Starace D.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11235-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Protein was quantitated by BCA assay (Pierce) after precipitation with 20 μg of polyadenylate, 7% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. SDS-PAGE (34Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) and Ag+ stains were done as described (35Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1985; 6: 103-112Crossref Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Western blots were probed with a monoclonal antibody to tetra-His (Qiagen) and visualized by ECL assay (Pierce). The plasmid pYAT271A carries a V. parahaemolyticus genomic fragment bearing the SglS (vSGLT) Na+/galactose cotransporter gene (23Sarker R.I. Ogawa W. Shimamoto T. Tsuchiya T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An initial attempt to place the reported530-residue coding sequence under an arabinose-inducible pBAD promoter resulted in a surprising inability to induce expression of Na+-dependent sugar transport in the glucose transport-impaired E. coli strain JM1100 (36Henderson P.J. Giddens R.A. Jones-Mortimer M.C. Biochem. J. 1977; 162: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Resequencing the pYAT271A insert revealed two bases that are missing in the original sequence report (D78137). The CG dinucleotide (boxed) is upstream of the incorrect initiator codon (ATG, above an aligned translation) and within the actual N-terminal coding region. The N-terminus is thus 13 residues longer (bold type), increasing the total number to 543. A ribosome binding sequence (bold type, underlined) occurs upstream of the correct initiator codon (ATG). Restoration of the sequence encoding these 13 residues to our original, nonfunctional pBAD construct enabled inducible Na+-dependent glucose cotransportin vivo. Uptake of radiolabeled glucose by full-length vSGLT, expressed under the pBAD promoter in JM1100 cells, was 34-fold greater in the presence of sodium (58.6 pmol/min·μg protein) than in choline, whereas cells bearing the empty vector had no sodium-dependent uptake (1.7 pmol/min·μg protein in either cation). In a typical purification on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Fig.1 A), a 20 mmimidazole wash removed most impurities (arrow a), and a 40 mm imidazole wash removed soluble aggregates of VNH6A with other proteins (arrow b). VNH6A was eluted in a single sharp peak with 250 mm imidazole (Fig. 1 A, arrow e) at >90% purity (Fig.2 A, lane Ni). Final purification by gel filtration shows a dominating peak of VNH6A corresponding to a 203-kDa apparent mass (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that VNH6A (60.7 kDa) dimerizes in C12M (micelle ≅ 76 kDa (37Keonig N. Zampighi G.A. Butler P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 590-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)).Figure 2Silver-stained SDS-PAGE gels of stages of VNH6A purification.

B, Western blot of purified VNH6A probed with an antibody to tetra-His.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Purified vSGLT migrates on SDS-PAGE at an apparent mass of 35 kDa (Fig.2 A, lane GF) and is recognized by an antibody to tetrahistidine (Fig. 2 B). Lipid apparently copurifies with VNH6A: a Ag+-staining band comigrates with a lecithin band from control liposomes (Fig. 2 A, cf. lanes GF andL), and neither band is stained by Coomassie R250 (not shown). The genomic fragment in pYAT271A was modified such that vSGLT expressed under the Vibrio promoter contained a C-terminal His tag identical to that of pBAD-expressed VNH6A. Proteins expressed under both pBAD and Vibriopromoters were purified separately for comparison by ESI-MS. Purified protein was subjected to HPLC gel filtration in organic solvent to remove detergent and lipid. Fig.3 (A and B) shows the UV absorbance and total ion current of VNH6A (highlighted) eluting at about 500 s. The average ESI-MS spectrum obtained from this eluting peak exhibits VNH6A molecular ions carrying 26–53 positive charges (Fig. 3 C). Twenty four measurements yield a single compound mass of 60,681 Da, which is within 0.015% (change of 9 Da) of the calculated mass of 60,671.7 Da for VNH6A of 559 residues (543 + 16) retaining its formylmethionine. The discrepancy between measured and calculated masses lies just outside the most stringent criterion of 0.008% applied to ESI data collected on a quadrupole instrument (38Ashton D.S. Beddell C.R. Green B.N. Oliver R.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), possibly because of limited methionine oxidation (addition of 16 Da). The mass determined by ESI-MS is consistent with an extracellular N terminus, because a periplasmic disposition prevents excision of the 150-Da formylmethionyl, or just the 28 Da formyl, group (39Flinta C. Persson B. Jeornvall H. von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 40von Heijne G. Nature. 1989; 341: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). vSGLT, bearing the His tag, was also expressed from pYAT271A (i.e. under its native Vibrio promoter) and purified. This protein yielded molecular ions carrying 29–61 charges, with 16 estimates of compound mass averaging 60,676 Da (Fig.3 E), which is within 0.008% of the calculated mass (60,671.7). Therefore, wild type vSGLT (i.e. without the His tag) must necessarily comprise 543 residues. A GFP fusion of vSGLT (VNGFPH6, functional in vivoand in PLs) was also purified and analyzed by ESI-MS, yielding 24 molecular ions carrying 47–78 charges (not shown). The compound mass determined averages 90,544 Da, which is within 0.008% of the calculated mass of 90,544.6 Da (before fluorophor formation) or within 0.01% of 90,542.5 (with hydrolyzed fluorophor). The sample preparation procedure for HPLC may lead to hydrolysis of the imidazolone ring or to an oxidation. Additionally, the fraction of analyzed VNGFPH6 protein that had completed the slow pathway of dehydration and oxidation to formation of the green fluorophor is unknown (calculated mass, 90,524.5 Da after fluorophor formation). Purified VNH6A was reconstituted into PLs (31Degrip W.J. Vanoostrum J. Bovee-Geurts P.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Aliquots (∼5 μl) of PLs, as prepared for uptake assays, were treated for freeze-fracture EM. In the replicas, PLs appeared as concave or convex surfaces of ∼200 nm in diameter. The fracture faces contained 1–3 intramembrane particles (Fig. 4,B–D). These particles were absent in control liposomes (Fig. 4 A). Moreover, PLs studied by SDS-PAGE showed one band of protein that was absent in control liposomes (Fig. 2 A,lanes PL and L), suggesting that these particles were induced by the addition of protein. To estimate the density and molecular dimensions of the reconstituted VNH6A, large PLs (≥ 2μm in diameter) with a 12-fold higher protein/lipid ratio were prepared by freeze-thawing a PL pellet, to increase the density of particles and reduce the PL radius of curvature. Consistent with the increase in protein, the particle density also increased, to be 352 ± 72/μm2 membrane (n = 2160 from 6.2 μm2) (Fig.4 E). At high magnification, vSGLT particles had an asymmetrical appearance with a long and short axis (Fig. 4 E,inset). Measurements indicated a single population of particles with a mean size of 9.1 ± 0.4 by 7.0 ± 0.5 nm (n = 70). The time course of galactose uptake into PLs exhibited an initial rate 10–25-fold higher in 100 mm Na+ than in choline (Fig. 5 A, ○). Maximum uptake at 30–60 min decayed thereafter with at12 of ∼150 min. The peak galactose content of the PLs in NaCl at 30–60 min is 4-fold higher than that, in Na+, at 300 min, and 19-fold higher than that of PLs in choline at 300 min. For PLs (andliposomes) in choline, a rapid, small initial sugar “uptake” (t12 < 1 min) was followed biphasically by slow influx (0.2 fmol/min) to ∼200 fmol at 300 min (Fig. 5 A, ●). This Na+-free initial rate in PLs or liposomes increased linearly with 12–400 μmgalactose (not shown), and thus both the rapid and slow components of the slight Na+-free uptake into PLs are independent of VNH6A and indicate transbilayer equilibration. The initial rate of sugar accumulation into control liposomes was typically about 55% that of PLs in the presence of choline and was not subtracted from the values plotted in Figs. 5 and 6. The initial rate of d-galactose transport into PLs was a saturable function of [Na+] (Fig. 5 B). TheK Na was calculated at 129 ± 8 mm, with a Hill coefficient of 0.9, and aV max of 128 ± 4 pmol/μg·min. Likewise, the initial rate of galactose transport was a saturable function of the external [galactose] (Fig. 5 C). In 100 mmNa+, the K galactose was 158 ± 10 μm, the Hill coefficient was 1.0, and theV max was 178 ± 5 pmol/μg·min. Indicative of cotransport, the apparent affinity for galactose decreased as external [NaCl] was reduced, theK galactose increasing by 2.6-fold with a 5-fold reduction of external [NaCl] to 20 mm. Sugar selectivity was assessed by the ability of external sugars (20 mm) to inhibit the initial uptake rate of [14C]d-galactose into PLs (Fig. 6). Addition of d-galactose reduced Na+-dependent radiotracer uptake to the level observed in choline. d-Glucose inhibited uptake by 92%, whereas d-fucose inhibited by 70%. l-glucose, 2-deoxy-d-glucose, or α-methyl-d-glucoside did not inhibit significantly. The presence of 20 mm sugars had no effect on uptake in choline. vSGLT bearing a C-terminal histidine tag was expressed, purified, and reconstituted as a functional Na+/galactose cotransporter. The native N terminus of vSGLT comprises an additional 13 residues, the omission of which results in a nonfunctional truncation of vSGLT. ESI-MS analysis of protein expressed from theVibrio genomic fragment establishes unequivocally these 13 residues in wild type vSGLT. This finding and the ability to determine the mass of the VNGFPH6 construct of >90 kDa and 15 transmembrane spans, affirm the utility of ESI-MS in membrane proteomics (29Whitelegge J.P. le Coutre J. Lee J.C. Engel C.K. Privé G.G. Faull K.F. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10695-10698Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 30le Coutre J. Whitelegge J.P. Gross A. Turk E. Wright E.M. Kaback H.R. Faull K.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4237-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The N terminus of vSGLT is predicted to reside extracellularly (2Turk E. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), as established for the human SGLT1 Na+/glucose (11Turk E. Kerner C.J. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1925-1934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), bacterial putP Na+/proline (12Jung H. Rübenhagen R. Tebbe S. Leifker K. Tholema N. Quick M. Schmid R.

Carrasco N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22657-22663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). ESI-MS is at least consistent with retention of the N-terminal Met residue and its N-formyl group, which accords with a periplasmic disposition of the N terminus (39Flinta C. Persson B. Jeornvall H. von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 40von Heijne G. Nature. 1989; 341: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Asp12 of the newly recognized and functionally essential N terminus corresponds to Asp28 of human SGLT1. Mutations D28N (15Turk E. Zabel B. Mundlos S. Dyer J. Wright E.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15204-15209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) each cause the disorder glucose/galactose malabsorption, and this aspartate is conserved in all SGLT sugar cotransporters as well as in the Na+/iodide and Na+/myoinositol cotransporters (see Fig. 2 of Ref. 2Turk E. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), suggesting a functional importance. Analysis of vSGLT in PLs by freeze-fracture EM demonstrates that the protein is integrated into the lipid membrane of unilamellar vesicles. The protein particles are homogeneous and asymmetrical (Fig.4 E). After correction for the replica thickness of 1.2 nm (33Eskandari S. Wright E.M. Kreman M. Starace D.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11235-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the average particle area measures 24 ± 5 nm2, a value comparable with that reported for rabbit SGLT1. The area of freeze fracture images of membrane proteins scales linearly with the number of transmembrane helices (33Eskandari S. Wright E.M. Kreman M. Starace D.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11235-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and the area of the vSGLT particles is consistent, within experimental error, with a monomeric protein of 14 transmembrane helices. Galactose transport in PLs was fully dependent on Na+. Rapid vesicular galactose accumulation, followed by slow efflux (Fig.5 A), is explicable only by cotransport. The slowness of galactose efflux in Na+ and insignificant galactose influx in choline indicate that these PL bilayers are impermeant. PLs show an apparent K Na of ∼130 mm in 100 μm galactose and an apparentK galactose of ∼160 mm in 100 mm Na+. Affinities observed here are significantly lower than those measured in vivo in E. coli: K Na < 10 mm andK galactose ∼40 μm (42Sarker R.I. Ogawa W. Tsuda M. Tanaka S. Tsuchiya T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1279: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In right-side-out vesicles from E. coli expressing vSGLT, a K Na of 6–9 mmwas observed in 100 μmglucose. 2Z. Xie, E. Turk, and E. M. Wright, unpublished data. It is notable that vSGLT apparent K m values for glucose transport differ markedly between V. parahaemolyticus cells (420 μm; Ref. 42Sarker R.I. Ogawa W. Tsuda M. Tanaka S. Tsuchiya T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1279: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and pYAT271A-transformed E. coli cells (30 μm; Ref. 23Sarker R.I. Ogawa W. Shimamoto T. Tsuchiya T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Possible reasons for lower apparent affinities here include the PL lipid composition, an effect of the C-terminal His tag, the lack of a negative inward transmembrane potential in the PLs, or the generation of an opposing positive inward transmembrane potential with Na+/galactose influx. The mass determined by ESI-MS does not suggest significant oxidation or other covalent chemical changes. Reconstituted vSGLT may reside in the bilayer in two orientations, as suggested by freeze fracture EM images of PLs showing particle retention on concave as well as convex faces. Distinct substrate affinities may be expected for the two orientations, but curve fitting of data of Fig. 5, Band C, to Michaelis-Menten equations for two distinct affinities for Na+ or for galactose contraindicates a secondK m for either substrate. We infer that the observedK m values reflect the appropriately oriented transporter, because the reverse orientation should exhibit the lowest affinities (43Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 63-79PubMed Google Scholar, 44Jung H. Tebbe S. Schmid R. Jung K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11083-11088Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), possibly too low to detect in our assays. Hill coefficients for Na+ and galactose of 0.9 and 1.0, respectively, suggest a 1:1 cotransport stoichiometry. Sugar preferences of reconstituted VNH6A (d-galactose >d-glucose > d-fucose) and lack of an inhibitory effect by 2-deoxy-d-glucose andl-glucose reflect characteristics of vSGLT in vivo (42Sarker R.I. Ogawa W. Tsuda M. Tanaka S. Tsuchiya T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1279: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Galactose turnover per VNH6A molecule is estimated from data in Fig. 5 C to be 0.4 s−1, assuming 50% correct transmembrane orientation. (A proline turnover of 1 s−1 was estimated for the reconstituted homologue putP (44Jung H. Tebbe S. Schmid R. Jung K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11083-11088Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).) These features are all diagnostic of a fully functional cotransporter. In summary, we show that a His-tagged fusion of the V. parahaemolyticus Na+/galactose cotransporter can be purified to apparent homogeneity and functionally reconstituted. ESI-MS confirms 13 newly recognized amino acid residues at the N terminus and suggests that the purified protein is unmodified either post-translationally or during purification. Freeze-fracture EM reveals that vSGLT exists in the bilayer as a monomer, as does its homologue, SGLT1. Sodium gradients drive galactose cotransport with apparent 1:1 stoichiometry, and sugar specificities generally correspond to those observed in vivo, although galactose and Na+affinities are unexpectedly low. The ability to purify a functional Na+/sugar cotransporter enables a variety of spectroscopic, labeling, and cross-linking experiments to probe structure and function, with results possibly relevant to other cotransporters in the SGLT family.

https://openalex.org/W1779463793,"New efforts in cancer therapy are being focused at various levels of signaling pathways. With phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) potentially being necessary for a range of cancer-related functions, we have investigated the influence of selected inositol tris- to hexakisphosphates on cell growth and tumorigenicity. We show that micromolar concentrations of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate and inositol 1,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5,6)P(4)] inhibit IGF-1-induced [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation in human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells and the ability to grow in liquid medium and form colonies in agarose semisolid medium by small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells, a human cancer cell line containing a constitutively active PI3-K. In an ovarian cancer cell line that also contains a constitutively active PI3-K (SKOV-3 cells), Ins(1,4,5,6)P(4) again inhibited liquid medium growth. Furthermore, when applied extracellularly, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate was shown indeed to enter SCLC cells. These effects appeared specifically related to PH domains known to bind to phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4)P(2)] and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)], indicating involvement of the PI3-K downstream target protein kinase B (PKB/Akt). This was further supported by inhibition of PKB/Akt PH domain membrane targeting in COS-7 cells by Ins(1,4,5,6)P(4). Thus, we propose that specific inositol polyphosphates inhibit PI3-K by competing with PtdIns(3,4, 5)P(3)-binding PH domains and that this occurs mainly at the level of the downstream PI3-K target, PKB/Akt."

Functions of p120 ctn , which are regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, may be modulated by the described SHP-1-p120 ctn interaction. protein-tyrosine phosphatase epidermal growth factor epidermal growth factor receptor glutathioneS-transferase wild-type polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction anhydrotetracycline signal-regulating protein The protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)1 SHP-1 (hematopoietic cell phosphatase, SH-PTP1, and PTP1C) (1Adachi M.

Stocco R. Shen S.H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). SHP-1 contains two SH2 domains that target the enzyme to cellular substrates. Binding of SHP-1 to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins results in activation of SHP-1. In consequence, the binding partner may become dephosphorylated, including the phosphotyrosine residues required for binding, leading eventually to decomposition of the complex. Alternatively and in addition, SHP-1 can dephosphorylate phosphoproteins in the vicinity of the SH2 domain-binding partner, e.g. signaling molecules acting downstream of a receptor that binds SHP-1 or vice versa. As revealed by analysis of chimeras of SHP-1 and the structurally closely related PTP SHP-2, selectivity of cellular actions of SHP-1 is also determined by the catalytic domain specificity, in addition to the SH2 domain specificity (7Tenev T. Keilhack H. Tomic S. Stoyanov B. Stein-Gerlach M. Lammers R. Krivtsov A.V. Ullrich A. Böhmer F.-D. J. Biol.

In hematopoietic cells, negative modulation of signal transduction of various cytokine receptors by SHP-1 has been firmly established, including signaling of the erythropoietin receptor (9Klingmüller U.

A family of tyrosine-phosphorylated transmembrane proteins, designated SIRP or SHP substrate (SHPS), has been described to bind SHP-1 and SHP-2 and is believed to regulate the cellular actions of both PTPs (21Fujioka Y.

Little is known about the biological role of SHP-1 in epithelial cells, although the existence of an epithelium-specific isoform of SHP-1 (6Banville D. Stocco R. Shen S.H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) is suggestive of specific functions in these cells. Cell-cell adhesion of epithelial cells involves homophilic interactions of cadherins (24Christofori G. Semb H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 73-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is important for development and maintenance of epithelial tissue integrity (25Birchmeier W. Birchmeier C. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 305-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and its disturbance contributes to the invasive and metastatic phenotype of epithelial tumors (26Birchmeier W. Behrens J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar, 27Thiery J.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Through their intracellular domains, cadherins associate with molecules of the Armadillo superfamily, including β-catenin and p120 catenin (p120 ctn ). The former binds to the carboxyl-terminal domain of E-cadherin and links this to the vinculin-related actin-binding α-catenin (28McCrea P.D. Gumbiner B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4514-4520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hülsken J. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast, p120 ctn binds to the juxtamembrane domain of the cytoplasmic part of E-cadherin (30Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4819-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Finnemann S. Mitrik I. Hess M. Otto G. Wedlich D. J. Biol.

Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Cadherin-catenin association is essential for the functionality of cell-cell adhesion complexes (33Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar). β-Catenin mediates association with the actin cytoskeleton via the α-catenin bridge (34Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), but also participates in intracellular signaling (35Ben-Ze'ev A. Geiger B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Thus, β-catenin can translocate to the nucleus to cooperate with transcription factors of the LEF/TCF family (36Eastman Q. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The stability of cadherin-catenin complexes and thereby the function of cell-cell adhesion complexes and possibly the signaling function of catenins appear to be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation (37Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6166-6170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). β-Catenin can be phosphorylated, for example, upon Src activation (38Behrens J. Vakaet L. Friis R. Winterhager E. van Roy F. Mareel M.M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation (39Hoschuetzky H. Aberle H. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), leading to dissociation of the cadherin-catenin complex. Elevated β-catenin phosphorylation has been observed in epithelial tumors (40Takayama T. Shiozaki H. Doki Y. Oka H. Inoue M. Yamamoto M. Tamura S. Shibamoto S. Ito F. Monden M. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A role of tyrosine phosphorylation in the regulation of catenin function and cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion can also be inferred from the presence of PTP activity in cadherin-catenin complexes and from the observation that the transmembrane PTPs PTPμ, PTPκ, and LAR localize to cell-cell adhesion complexes and can associate with β-catenin (41Brady-Kalnay S.M. Mourton T. Nixon J.P. Pietz G.E. Kinch M. Chen H. Brackenbury R. Rimm D.L. Del Vecchio R.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 42Fuchs M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10173-10183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Pronounced tyrosine phosphorylation has also been observed for p120 ctn (44Reynolds A.B. Roesel D.J. Kanner S.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 45Downing J.R. Reynolds A.B. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 607-613PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to Src, the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase FER has been shown to phosphorylate p120 ctn (46Rosato R. Veltmaat J.M. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5762-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 47Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The precise function of p120 ctn is, however, still not known. It has been reported to be involved in positive regulation of cadherin clustering and cell-cell adhesion, but also in cell motility (48Yap A.S. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 49Reynolds A.B. Daniel J.M. Mo Y.Y. Wu J. Zhang Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recent publications reveal apparently conflicting roles for p120 ctn in cadherin-mediated adhesion. Phosphorylated p120 ctn isoforms have been proposed to negatively modulate cadherin function and cell-cell adhesion in human colon carcinoma cells (50Aono S. Nakagawa S. Reynolds A.B. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and transfected mouse L-cells (51Ohkubo T. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Yap et al. (48Yap A.S. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) and Thoreson et al.(32Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) showed that the juxtamembrane domain of cadherins supports clustering and promotes strong cell-cell adhesion. p120 ctn isoforms lacking sequences encoded by exon 20, designated exon B, have the capacity to localize to the nucleus, suggesting nuclear functions of p120 ctn (52van Hengel J. Vanhoenacker P. Staes K. van Roy F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7980-7985Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Indeed, p120 ctn was shown to form a complex with a zinc-finger transcription factor named Kaiso (53Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3614-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The physiological role for tyrosine phosphorylation of p120 ctn is currently unknown, but is likely to regulate p120 ctn function. Inducible FER overexpression in Rat-2 fibroblasts led to reduced association of cadherin with α-and β-catenins, suggesting that FER-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of p120 ctn may negatively regulate the stability of cell-cell adhesion complexes (46Rosato R. Veltmaat J.M. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5762-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We show here that p120 ctn is one of the main binding partners for the PTP SHP-1 in EGF-stimulated A431 cells and a substrate for SHP-1 in these cells. Different isoforms of p120 ctn exhibit differential SHP-1 interaction potential, and this appears to be partly related to their capacity to become tyrosine-phosphorylated in an EGF-dependent manner. We propose that SHP-1 may regulate the function of p120 ctn by its dephosphorylation. EGF was purchased from Pepro Tech, Inc., (Rocky Hill, NJ). Polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and monoclonal anti-p120 ctn antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies covalently coupled to Sepharose (clone PT-66) were from Sigma. Polyclonal anti-SHP-1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Vav2 antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. X. Bustelo (State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY). A431 cells were from American Type Culture Collection (CRL 1555; Manassas, VA), and human embryonal kidney 293 cells were kindly provided by Dr. A. Ullrich (Max-Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany). Both cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. A cDNA for human SHP-1 (epithelial form) was generously provided by Drs. A. Ullrich and R. Lammers (Max-Planck Institute for Biochemistry). Generation of A431 cell lines with inducible SHP-1 expression is described elsewhere (54Tenev T. Böhmer S.A. Kaufmann R. Frese S. Bittorf T. Beckers T. Böhmer F.-D. Eur. J.

A431 cells were grown in 94-mm dishes to ∼70% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were starved for 16 h using serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and subsequently stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 min and lysed in 700 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm sodium pervanadate). Note that this Triton X-100 concentration appeared to be critical to observe the SHP-1-p120 ctn association, as little if any association could be seen at 1% Triton X-100. The lysates were centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min. To investigate binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to SHP-1, 50 μg of GST-SHP-1 WT, GST-SHP-1 R32K, GST-SHP-1 R138K, GST-SHP-1 R32K,R138K, or GST proteins were coupled to 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The A431 cell lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with the immobilized fusion proteins by end-over-end rotation. The beads were washed three times with HNGT buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mm sodium pervanadate). Then, 60 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer were added, and the mixture was boiled for 5 min. Bound proteins were visualized by SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide gels) and immunoblotting as described previously (7Tenev T. Keilhack H. Tomic S. Stoyanov B. Stein-Gerlach M. Lammers R. Krivtsov A.V.

To identify glycosylated SHP-1-binding tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, a deglycosylation assay was used. Thirty μl of glutathione beads with associated proteins (as described above) were incubated with 45 μl of solution containing 0.1% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min at 95 °C. Then, 45 μl of 2× reaction buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7), 40 mm EDTA, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 2% Triton X-100) and 0.5 units of endoglycosidases F/N (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added. The reaction was incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, 18 μl of 6× Laemmli buffer were added, and the mixture was boiled for 5 min. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide gels) and immunoblotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. To investigate whether the interaction of SHP-1 and p120 ctn is direct or not, a sequential immunoprecipitation approach was used. This was done basically as described previously (55Keilhack H.

Briefly, subconfluent A431 cells (94-mm dishes) were stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min and lysed in 700 μl of lysis buffer. p120 ctn was immunoprecipitated in its tyrosine-phosphorylated form using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies covalently coupled to Sepharose. The bound proteins were denatured by boiling in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 1% SDS, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min and subsequently partially renatured by diluting the sample 1:20 with lysis buffer and incubating at 4 °C for 30 min. Thereafter, the partially renatured lysates were used in GST pull-down assays employing 50 μg of GST-SHP-1 WT, GST-SH2 (isolated tandem SH2 domains of SHP-1 as a GST fusion protein), GST-SHP-1 CS (catalytically inactive C455S mutant of SHP-1), or GST (as a control). The associated proteins were visualized by SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide gels) and immunoblotting. To monitor binding of the p120 ctn isoforms to SHP-1, cDNAs for isoforms 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 3N, 3AB, 3AC, 3ABC, 3B, 3C, and 3BC (cloned into expression vector pEFBOS) (52van Hengel J. Vanhoenacker P.

The lysates were centrifuged at 25,000 ×g for 20 min and subsequently incubated with end-over-end rotation at 4 °C with 10 μg of GST-SHP-1 immobilized on 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose for 2 h. The beads were washed with HNGT buffer, and noncovalently bound proteins were extracted by boiling for 5 min in the presence of 60 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer. The proteins were visualized by SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide gels) and immunoblotting. A431 cells were cultured at large scale in 94-mm dishes. The cells were stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min when they reached 70% confluence. The cells were lysed in 700 μl of lysis buffer/plate. The lysates were centrifuged at 25,000 ×g for 20 min, pooled, and loaded onto a 0.5-ml anti-phosphotyrosine-Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer R1 (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 0.5 m NaCl). The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer R1 and subsequently with 10 ml of buffer R2 (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm Na3VO4). The bound phosphoproteins were eluted with 3 ml of 20 mm phenyl phosphate dissolved in buffer R2. Thereafter, the eluate was applied to a MonoQ HR5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer R2 and connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system. The bound proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–500 mm NaCl within 20 ml). The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining, and positive fractions were identified by running GST pull-down assays using GST-SHP-1 as described above. These positive fractions were pooled; 80% acetone was added; and the mixture was kept on ice for 1 h. The precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was dried and dissolved in 2× Laemmli buffer. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide gels). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and the respective bands were excised and used for structure analysis. The excised band was prepared for and subjected to in-gel digestion as described (59Hellman U. Kamp R.M. Choli-Papadopoulou T. Wittmann-Liebold B.

In brief, after washing with ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile, the gel piece was completely dried, and a solution containing modified porcine trypsin (sequence-grade; Promega, Madison, WI) was allowed to soak into the gel piece. After overnight incubation at 30 °C, generated peptides were recovered by extraction. The peptide mixture was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry using a Bruker Biflex III instrument equipped with delayed extraction and reflector. The sample was prepared by the dried droplet technique using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. The instrument was externally calibrated using angiotensin II (MH+ 1046.54) and adrenocorticotropic hormone fragment 18–39 (MH+ 2465.20). The peptide mass fingerprinting analysis was done using ProFound Version 4.7.5. For Edman degradation, peptides were isolated by microbore reversed-phase liquid chromatography on a 1 × 150-mm Kromasil C18 column operated in the SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Selected fractions were subjected to amino acid sequence analysis in a Procise 494 instrument (PE-Biosystems, Foster City, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was isolated from A431 cells using the RNA-easy kit (QIAGEN Inc., Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For RT-PCR, cDNA was synthesized as described previously (57Keirsebilck A. Bonne S. Staes K. van Hengel J. Nollet F. Reynolds A. van Roy F. Genomics. 1998; 50: 129-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The PCR mixtures contained template cDNA, 25 pmol of p120 ctn -specific primers, 200 mm dXTPs, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and the buffer supplied with theTaq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc., Gent, Belgium).Taq DNA polymerase was used at 0.5 units/reaction. The following primers were used: primer set EX1F6 plus EX5R1 covers the 5′-end (alternative start codons) of the p120 ctn cDNAs; set EX10F2 plus EX12R1 generates a product of 175 base pairs when exon C is absent and one of 193 base pairs when exon C is present; set EX15F1 and EX20R1 amplifies only cDNA fragments that contain exon B; and set EX18F1 and EX21R3 amplifies only fragments that contain exon A (a 557-base pair product in the presence of exon B and a 470-base pair product when exon B sequences are spliced out). The primer sequences and the corresponding cycling conditions were described before (57Keirsebilck A. Bonne S. Staes K. van Hengel J. Nollet F. Reynolds A. van Roy F. Genomics. 1998; 50: 129-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To monitor the interaction of p120 ctn and SHP-1 in intact cells, A431 cells with inducible SHP-1 expression were used (54Tenev T. Böhmer S.A. Kaufmann R. Frese S. Bittorf T. Beckers T. Böhmer F.-D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in the absence of anhydrotetracycline (ATc) in 94-mm dishes to 70% confluence and then either stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for different time points or left unstimulated and lysed in 700 μl of lysis buffer Z (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm zinc acetate). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 25,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C and subjected to immunoprecipitation using monoclonal anti-SHP-1 antibodies (1 μg/reaction). The immunoprecipitations were incubated with end-over-end rotation for 2 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added, and the mixtures were incubated for another 30 min with end-over-end rotation at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with HNGT buffer containing 1 mm zinc acetate in place of the sodium pervanadate, and the noncovalently bound proteins were extracted by boiling in 40 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide gels) and visualized by immunoblotting. To analyze the dependence of tyr"

To date 14 activating mutations in CaR showing increased sensitivity to Ca2+ have been identified in humans with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia. Four of these activating mutations are found in the Ala116–Pro136 region of CaR, indicating that this part of the receptor is particularly sensitive to mutation-induced activation. This region was subjected to random saturation mutagenesis, and 219 mutant receptor clones were isolated and screened pharmacologically in a high throughput screening assay. Selected mutants were characterized further in an inositol phosphate assay. The vast majority of the mutants tested displayed an increased affinity for Ca2+. Furthermore, 21 of the mutants showed increased basal activity in the absence of agonist. This constitutive activity was not diminished when the mutations were transferred to a chimeric receptor Ca/1a consisting of the amino-terminal domain of the CaR and the 7 transmembrane and intracellular domains of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR1a. CPCCOEt, a noncompetitive antagonist acting at the 7 transmembrane domain of mGluR1a, suppressed the elevated basal response of the constitutively activated Ca/1a mutants demonstrating inverse agonist activity of CPCCOEt. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the Ala116–Pro136 region is of key importance for the maintenance of the inactive conformation of CaR.

The receptors in this family consist of a peptide chain longer than those of previously identified GPCRs and share no amino acid sequence similarity with any of these. Most notable is the unusually long amino-terminal domain (ATD) of ∼500–600 amino acids, which has been shown to contain the site of agonist binding of CaR (7Bräuner-Osborne H. Jensen A.A.

The ATDs of the family C receptors have limited amino acid sequence similarity with procaryotic periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs), a family of proteins involved in the transport of nutrients into bacteria (13Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of one of these PBPs, the leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein, we have previously proposed a tertiary molecular model of the ATD of mGluR1 (9O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thøgersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Recently, Pin and co-workers (11Galvez T. Parmentier M.L. Joly C. Malitschek B. Kaupmann K. Kuhn R. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Pin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13362-13369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) have presented a model of the ATD of GABABR1a based on the crystal structure of the leucine-binding protein. The ATD of the family C receptor is thought to be constituted by two globular lobes separated by a hinge region creating a cleft. Two pseudo-conserved amino acids, corresponding to Ser79 and Thr102 in the leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein, have been identified as agonist binding residues in mGluR1 and GABABR1 (9O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thøgersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R.

Furthermore, the two corresponding amino acids in CaR, Ser147 and Ser170, have been shown to be involved in receptor activation (7Bräuner-Osborne H. Jensen A.A. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18382-18386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Based on the known mechanism of the PBPs (13Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that agonist binding to these amino acid residues causes the ATD of the family C receptor to contract from an “open” inactive conformation to a “closed” active conformation (9O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thøgersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R.

However, it is still unresolved how the activation signal subsequently is transferred from the closed ATD through the 7TM domain to the intracellular G-proteins. CaR plays a central role in the extracellular calcium homeostasis. The receptor is expressed in parathyroid, kidney, intestine, central nervous system, and several other tissues (14Brown E.M. Am. J. Med. 1999; 106: 238-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The primary function of CaR is to sense and mediate the effects of even minute changes in extracellular Ca2+ concentrations into parathyroid hormone secretion and renal excretion (14Brown E.M. Am. J. Med. 1999; 106: 238-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In accordance with this, mutations in the CaR gene have been shown to cause abnormalities in blood Ca2+ levels. Three inherited human disorders have been linked to these somatic mutations: familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism, which are caused by inactivating mutations in CaR, and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia, which has been associated with activating mutations in CaR (14Brown E.M. Am. J. Med. 1999; 106: 238-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The identified genetic mutations in CaR are depicted in Fig.1. As can be seen, almost all of the mutations are located in the first half of the ATD and in the 7TM domain. We found it of particular interest that 4 of the 14 identified activating mutations are located in the Ala116–Phe128 region of CaR. Ala116–Phe128 constitutes the first part of a region, Ala116–Pro136, which according to alignments with PBPs forms a loop in the ATD (7Bräuner-Osborne H. Jensen A.A. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.

In this study we have applied this technique to investigate whether the Ala116–Pro136 region of CaR is indeed as sensitive to mutational induced activation as suggested by the pattern of genetic mutations. Furthermore, we have studied the pharmacology of activated CaR mutants in greater detail using chimeric CaR/mGluR1a receptors and the noncompetitive mGluR1 antagonist, 7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (CPCCOEt). All chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Culture media, serum, antibiotics, and buffers for cell culture were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Paisley, UK). CPCCOEt was purchased from Tocris (Bristol, UK). rCaR-pRK5 (2Ruat M. Molliver M.E. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Snyder (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) and professor Shigetada Nakanishi (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan), respectively. The pSI and pEGFP-N2 vectors were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI) andCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA), respectively. The tsA cells were a generous gift from Dr. Penelope S. V. Jones (University of California, San Diego, CA). CaR was transferred from the pRK5 vector to the pSI vector as described previously (7Bräuner-Osborne H. Jensen A.A. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18382-18386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A silent SalI restriction site was created in the coding sequence for CaR spanning from nucleotide numbers 408–413 using the Quickchange mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Construction of the CaRΔ1035-EGFP plasmid was done by subcloning CaR into pEGFP-N2 using the restriction enzymes XhoI (a unique flanking restriction enzyme) and ApaI (covering nucleotides 3103–3108 in CaR). Subsequently, the mutagenic regions of three constitutively active (CA) mutants (mutants 17, 37, and 122) were subcloned into CaRΔ1035-EGFP using the restriction enzymesXhoI and EcoRI. The construction of the chimeric receptor Ca/1a, consisting of the ATD of CaR and the transmembrane and intracellular domains of mGluR1a, has been described previously (7Bräuner-Osborne H. Jensen A.A. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18382-18386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The mutagenic regions of the CA mutants of CaR-pSI were subcloned into Ca/1a-pSI using the restriction enzymes XhoI andEcoRI. Amplified receptor DNAs were sequenced on an ABI Prism 310 using Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer, Warrington, UK). Random saturation mutagenesis was performed on the 21-amino acid region Ala116–Pro136 in CaR-pSI (nucleotides 346–407). The principles of random saturation mutagenesis are given in Fig. 2. A polymerase chain reaction was performed using the primers P1 and P2. P1 was a 23-nucleotide-long, nonmutagenic primer that included the HindIII site in the pSI vector. P2 was a 90-nucleotide-long primer. It was 15% “doped” in the 62-nucleotide region of interest, meaning that 85% of the correct nucleotide and 5% of each of the three other nucleotides were used for each individual nucleotide during in the synthesis of the primer. Furthermore, P2 had a SalI site in the same position as the silent SalI site in CaR-pSI. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with HindIII andSalI, and the cassettes were ligated into theHindIII/SalI fragment of CaR-pSI yielding a mutant CaR-pSI library. Competent DH5α Escherichia coli cells (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK) were transformed with the ligation mix, and mutant CaR-pSI clones were individually amplified. Plasmid DNA was isolated from 219 clones with the QIAprep spin plasmid miniprep kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and used for sequencing and functional assays. NIH 3T3 cells and tsA cells (a transformed HEK 293 cell line (21Chahine M. Bennett P.B. George Jr., A.L. Horn R. Pflügers Arch. 1994; 427: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar)) were maintained at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% calf serum. NIH 3T3 cells were plated into 96-well plates 1 day before transfection using 104 cells/well. The cells were transfected with 2.5 ng of wild type (WT) or mutant CaR-pSI and 25 ng of β-galactosidase-pSI/well using Superfect (Qiagen) as a DNA carrier. One day after transfection, cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 0.5% calf serum, and 2% Cyto-SF3 (Kemp Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) to a final volume of 200 μl. The concentration of CaCl2 in the medium was 0.9 mmat “basal” and at “stimulation” conditions, whereas the concentration of MgCl2 was 0.8 and 4.0 mm, respectively. After 5 days of incubation, β-galactosidase levels were measured, as described previously (22Lim K. Chae C.-B. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The medium was removed from the wells, the cells were washed with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, and 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 3.5 mm o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 was added to each well. The 96-well plate was incubated at room temperature up to 3 h, and the plates were read at 415 nm on a plate reader (Microplate Autoreader, Biotek Instruments Inc., Burlington, VT). The screening of the mutants was done twice in triplicate. 3 × 105 tsA cells were split into a 6-cm tissue culture plate and transfected with 1.7 μg of plasmid the following day using Superfect as a DNA carrier according to the protocol by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The day after transfection, the cells were split into 12 wells in a poly-d-lysine-coated 24-well tissue culture plate in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with reduced concentrations of CaCl2 (0.9 mm) and MgCl2 (0.6 mm), supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 10% dialyzed calf serum, and 1 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). 16–24 h later, the cells were washed with Hanks' balanced saline solution (HBSS) and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in HBSS. The buffer was removed, and the cells were incubated for 40 min in HBSS supplemented with 10 mm LiCl and various concentrations of CaCl2 or 100 μm CPCCOEt. The reactions were stopped by exchanging the buffer with 500 μl of ice-cold 20 mm formic acid, and separation of total [3H]inositol phosphates was carried out by ion exchange chromatography as described previously (23Nanevics T. Wang L. Chen M. Ishii M. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 702-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). All IP experiments were performed in duplicate, and the results are given as the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. The endogenous concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in HBSS were measured by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy, using an AAnalyst 100 (Perkin-Elmer, Warrington, UK). 3 × 105 tsA cells were split into a 6-cm tissue culture plate and transfected with 1.7 μg of pSI, pEGFP-N2, CaRΔ1035-EGFP, or mutant CaRΔ1035-EGFP the following day using Superfect as a DNA carrier according to the protocol by the manufacturer (Qiagen). The day after transfection, the cells were split into poly-d-lysine-coated 3.5-cm wells containing a glass slide (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with reduced concentrations of CaCl2 (0.9 mm) and MgCl2 (0.6 mm), supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% dialyzed calf serum. The following day, single cell fluorescence were viewed with an Axiovert 100M (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using the objective Plan-Apochromat 63 × 14 W Oil (DiC) and an excitation wavelength of 488 nm (emission maximum 507 nm). Data from the Ca2+concentration-response experiments were fitted to the simple mass action equation as follows. R=Rmax1+(EC50/[A])n+Rbasal(Eq. 1) where [A] is the concentration of agonist, n is the Hill coefficient, and R is the response. Curves were generated by nonweighted least squares fits using the program KaleidaGraph 3.08 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). To investigate whether the receptor library was indeed randomly mutated, we se-quenced the 25 mutant receptor clones first isolated, prior to the pharmacological screen. As shown in TableI, the mutations are randomly distributed over the entire region of interest. All of the 62 individual nucleotides in the region are mutated between one and eight times in the 25 mutants. The mean value ± S.D. of number of mutations of an individual nucleotide in these 25 mutants is 3.6 ± 1.4, which is in excellent agreement with the theoretical mean of 3.75. The number of mutations of each individual nucleotide in these 25 mutants can be described by the binomial function; b (25,0.15). H0:p = 0.15 was accepted, when tested both withn = 1 and n = 8. Hence H: p ≠ 0.15 could not be proven for any of the 62 nucleotides. Consequently, it is reasonable to conclude that this library consists of mutant receptors being randomly mutated in the nucleotide 346–407 region.Table IThe nucleotide 346–408 sequence sequences of WT CaR and the 25 mutants first preparedReceptorNucleotide 346–408 sequenceWTgcc cag aac aaa atc gat tct ttg aac ctg gac gag ttc tgc aac tgc tct gag cac atc ccG1— — — — — — –G -A- — -C- -C- — — — — — A– –A –A -A- –G2— — — — G– — — — — — — — — –A C-A — –C — — — –G3— — G– — — –G — — — — — — — — — — –A — — — –G4— — -T- C– — — — -G- — –A CGG — — -T- C– — — –C –G G– –G5— — G– C– — — — — — T– — — C-G A– –A — — — — –A –G6-T- — — — — –G — — — — — –A — — — — -A- — -C- -A- –G7— — — — –T — — — — GA- — — C– CGG — — -G- — — — –G8— -G- G– — — T– — — — — — T– –T — — — — — — — –G9–T — — — — — — –T — -A- AT- — — –G — — A– A– — — GAG10— A– — — –A T– -A- — –T G– — –T GC- — -G- — — — — — A-G11— — — -T- — AG- G– — G-T — C– — — — G-T — — — — C– –G12— — G-A — TG- — -A- — — — — –A A– — -T- A-A — — — -G- -TG13— — –A — — — A– — –A — — — G– –G — -A- — -G- -C- — –G14— — — –T — — — –A — -A- — — — — — — — — A– –G –G15— -C- — — G– — — -G- — — — -T- — — C– A– — — — CAA TGG16–A –T — –C — –A -T- — — G– — A– — A– — — –C TGA — — –G17-AT –A –A — — –C — –C — –A -C- A– — C– — G– — — -T- — –G18-A- — -T- — — -G- -A- — — — — — G-A –T — –T — — — GA- –G19-G- — — — — — — -A- — –T –G -T- — -C- — — –C — — -G- T-G20A– T– — — –A — — –T — — –G — A– -C- — -TA — -G- — — –G21— G-C — –G — –C -G- — -T- A– –A -C- — — — — -AA — — — –G22— — –A GT- — T– — –T C– G– — — — — — –A A– — –A –A –G23— — — — G– — — C– — — –T –T –A -A- T– –G -G- -C- — — –G24— — -C- — –A T-G — C– G– — — — G– — — G– -A- — G– — –G25— TC- — — — — -AA — — -A- — — — — CC- — — -G- — — –GMutation frequency143 433 434 323 414 626 262 245 313 653 345 334 814 455 633 425 355 253 233 464 43-Mutated nucleotides are indicated as capital letters.

Both Ca2+ and Mg2+ were present in low concentrations (0.9 mm Ca2+ and 0.8 mm Mg2+) at basal conditions, because of their importance for proper cell adhesion and function. These concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ did not activate WT CaR (Fig.3). This is in agreement with previous results using, for example, IP measurements (7Bräuner-Osborne H. Jensen A.A. Sheppard P.O.

As exemplified by Mg2+ in Fig. 3, both agonists showed robust responses on CaR transfected cells in R-SATTM when the concentration was increased. However, we decided to use Mg2+ for the library screening because Ca2+ showed a significant effect on mock-transfected NIH 3T3 cells at concentrations higher than 1.5 mm (data not shown). This was not the case with submaximal concentrations of Mg2+ (Fig. 3). The screening data for a representative collection of mutants are given in Fig. 3. Based on the screening, the mutants could be divided into “WT-like” mutants, mutants with increased basal activity, and impaired/nonfunctional mutants. 78 mutants with either a significantly increased basal activity or a response comparable with that of WT CaR were selected for further pharmacological characterization. The pharmacological characterization was performed using PI hydrolysis as a functional assay. In this assay exposure of mock-transfected tsA cells to Ca2+ at concentrations up to 10 mm did not give rise to any significant increase in IP accumulation (data not shown). In agreement with previous reports (7Bräuner-Osborne H. Jensen A.A. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1762515516,"Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common form of aging-related neurodegenerative disorders, is associated with formation of fibrillar deposits of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta). While the direct involvement of Abeta in AD has been well documented, the relations between Abeta production, amyloid formation, and neurodegeneration remain unknown. We propose that AD is initiated by a protein aging-related structural transformation in soluble Abeta. We hypothesize that spontaneous chemical modification of aspartyl residues in Abeta to transient succinimide induces a non-native conformation in a fraction of soluble Abeta, rendering it amyloidogenic and neurotoxic. Conformationally altered Abeta is characterized by increased stability in solution and the presence of a non-native beta-turn that determines folding of Abeta in solution and the structure of Abeta subunits incorporated into amyloid fibrils. While the soluble 'non-native' Abeta is both the factor triggering the neurodegenerative cascade and the precursor of amyloid plaques, these two events result from interaction of Abeta with different sets of cellular components and need not coincide in space and time. Extensive literature data and experimental evidence are provided in support of this hypothesis."

Tiam1 is a member of the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors that activate Rho family GTPases. These exchange factors have in common a catalytic Dbl homology and adjacent pleckstrin homology domain. Previous structural studies suggest that the pleckstrin domain, a putative phosphoinositide-binding site, may serve a regulatory function. We identified ascorbyl stearate as a compound that binds to the pleckstrin domain of p120 Ras GTPase-activating protein. Furthermore, ascorbyl stearate appears to be a general pleckstrin domain ligand, perhaps by mimicking an endogenous amphiphilic ligand. Tiam1 nucleotide exchange activity was greatly stimulated by ascorbyl stearate. Certain phosphoinositides also stimulated Tiam1 activity but were less potent than ascorbyl stearate. Tiam1 contains an additional N-terminal pleckstrin domain, but only the C-terminal pleckstrin domain was required for activation. Our results suggest that the pleckstrin domains of Dbl-type proteins may not only be involved in subcellular localization but may also directly regulate the nucleotide exchange activity of an associated Dbl homology domain.

A role in transformation had been foreshadowed by the recognition that a class of potent oncogenes, the Dbl family members, were activators of Rho GTPases (20Hart M.J. Eva A. Evans T. Aaronson S.A. Cerione R.A. Nature. 1991; 354: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Like members of the Ras superfamily of GTPases, Rho GTPases cycle between GDP- and GTP-bound states and actively transmit signals in the GTP-bound state. GDP/GTP cycling is affected not only by intrinsic GTPase activity but also by accessory proteins such as GDP dissociation inhibiting factors (GDI), GTPase-activating proteins (GAP), and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) (21Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). Dbl family GEFs stimulate the rate of nucleotide exchange on the Rho subfamily of small GTP-binding proteins, thereby converting them to an active state. GEFs that activate Rho family proteins have in common a Dbl homology (DH) and an adjacent PH domain. In this related family of GEFs, the DH domain is believed to mediate the stimulation of exchange (22Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The function of the PH domain is still unclear. Interestingly, many other GTPase-regulating proteins, such as p120 Ras GAP, also contain PH domains (21Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar).In Rho family GEFs, the PH domain is situated immediately C-terminal to the DH domain, and truncation of the PH domain of Dbl does not affect GEF activity in vitro but does prevent cytoskeletal association of and transformation by Dbl (23Zheng Y. Zangrilli D. Cerione R.A. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19017-19020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Similarly, the transforming capacity of Lfc is abolished by truncations of the PH domain. In this case, transforming ability can be restored by providing membrane localization via prenylation (24Whitehead I. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Therefore, for these two Dbl family members, the PH domain facilitates the activation of the GTPase by promoting proper cellular localization.The Dbl family member Tiam1 was identified in a screen for genes that allowed a noninvasive lymphoma to infiltrate a fibroblast monolayer (T-lymphoma invasion andmetastasis) (25Habets G.G. Scholtes E.H. Zuydgeest D. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Berns A. Collard J.G. Cell. 1994; 77: 537-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). In this screen, retroviral insertion caused overexpression of an N-terminally truncated Tiam1 that conferred an invasive phenotype. Overexpression of truncated Tiam1 in NIH3T3 cells also stimulates ruffling and tumorigenicity (26van Leeuwen F.N. van der Kammen R.A. Habets G.G. Collard J.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2215-2221PubMed Google Scholar). These effects are presumably via activation of Rac; constitutive activation of Rac by point mutation also induces ruffling (12Ridley A.J.

In an effort to examine the functions of PH domains, we have identified a PH domain ligand and explored its effects on enzymatic activity. Results of these biochemical experiments along with additional genetic experiments addressing the role of the PH domains of Tiam1 support the view that PH domains are able to regulate enzymatic activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSynthesis of Ascorbyl EstersThe synthesis of the various C-6 ascorbyl esters followed the procedure covered in the patent US 4997958.

Primer pairs used were both 5′-CCATAAAACCATGGGAAACGC-3′ and 5′-GGTTCCGCGGAAGAGAAGGAT-3′ with 5′-GACTGGCCCGGGGAACTGAGG-3′; and 5′-TCGGATGCGGATAAGCTGCGC-3′ with 5′-GTGACTGGCGACCTTGTTCAT-3′. Two partial clones of human Tiam1 cDNA were retrieved, one contained nucleotides 1–2972 and the other contained nucleotides 2972–4657 (numbering throughout corresponds to published hTiam1 cDNA ((35Habets G.G. van der Kammen R.W. Stam J.C. Michiels F. Collard J.G. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1371-1376PubMed Google Scholar), NCBI GenBank accession number U16296). To obtain missing C-terminal sequences, a PCR employing oligonucleotides designed against the hTiam1 cDNA 5′-CGGAATTCAGATTTCGACACATGATC-3′ and 5′-TCGCCCGGGGCAGGTGACGCAGTCAGA-3′ (contains SmaI site downstream of stop codon) as primers and a human hippocampal library (CLONTECH accession number HL3023b) as template produced a fragment containing nucleotides 4458–5366 that was added to existing clones using the internalEco47III (4487) site. A similar strategy using the antisense primer 5′-GATCCCGGGTCATGTTTCTGGTTCTGGGATCTCAGTGTTCAGTTTCCTG-3′ was used to add the KT3 epitope tag “PEPET,” a stop codon, and aSmaI site to the end of Tiam1. To splice the two partial clones together, a PCR reaction using 5′-CGGAATTCCATGGGCCGCCTTGGAATCT-3′ and 5′-TCGCCCGGGCGTCAGCAGCACGATTAT-3′ as primers and a human brain cDNA library (CLONTECH accession number HL50156) as template produced a product spanning nucleotides 2422–3189, which was cloned into pBS SK+ (Stratagene accession number 212201) using EcoRI and SmaI. NcoI (472)-NcoI (2422) and StuI (3134)-SmaI fragments were ligated into this vector, creating full-length clones, with and without the KT3 tag.Alterations from Published SequenceThe 5′ clone obtained from the library contained an insert of sequence 5′-GGTGAGCAGTTTACACTTTCATATACTCCCTGTCATGTGCTTTGAAGGACTTTCTAGGGGCATCAAG-3′ in the upstream noncoding region at nucleotide 105. Original clones from the Stratagene fetal brain library as well as all PCR products from CLONTECH hippocampal and brain libraries contained a difference in sequence from the published Tiam1 cDNA (35Habets G.G. van der Kammen R.W. Stam J.C. Michiels F. Collard J.G. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1371-1376PubMed Google Scholar); a G at nucleotide 3005 instead of a C, which therefore encodes a Gln in position 844 instead of a His. In addition, PCR introduced mutations G4739A and G5153A.Expression Vectors of Tiam1To express Tiam1 in baculovirus, the following expression vectors were constructed.135-kDa Tiam1The 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides 5′-GTCATGATGG-3′ and 5′-TCCATCATGACGGCC-3′ were used as linkers to recircularize ApaI-EcoNI (1673)-digested pBS SK+-based full-length Tiam1. The linker-created BspHI site and the vector-derived SpeI site were used to clone the 4006-bp fragment into NcoI-XbaI-digested pAcC4 (36Rubinfeld B. Munemitsu S. Clark R. Conroy L. Watt K.

These primers also restored the KT3 tag. For expression in mammalian cells, a subset of these truncation mutants were subcloned into pCANmyc (38Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S.

All proteins and compounds were diluted to 4-fold their final concentrations in buffer A (GTPases were diluted in buffer A containing 1 μm GDP). To dilute ascorbyl stearate, ascorbyl palmitate, and stearic acid, 25 mm EtOH solutions were slowly added to buffer A while vortexing vigorously. Other lipids were dried under nitrogen and before use, resuspended in aqueous solution with vortexing and bath sonication and then diluted into buffer A.

Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 53Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). It has been established that the DH domain is responsible for mediating GEF activity (22Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the notion that PH domains provide proper cellular localization, the PH domains of Dbl and Lfc mediate cytoskeletal and membrane association, respectively (23Zheng Y. Zangrilli D. Cerione R.A. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19017-19020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24Whitehead I. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, for both of these oncogenes, an intact PH domain is necessary for cellular transformation.Recently, it has been found that the interaction of PH domains with specific lipids can directly regulate the enzymatic activity of proteins in vitro. For example, dynamin GTPase activity is enhanced by PIP2 and IP3, but not by PIP3, in a PH domain-dependent manner (6Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I.E. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayoutou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), and the PKB upstream activating kinase PDK1 is directly stimulated by PIP3 (8Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). ARNO, a PH-containing ADP-ribosylation factor exchange factor unrelated to the Dbl family is activated by PIP2 (5Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Beraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 7Paris S. Beraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Bigay J. Antonny B. Chabre M. Chardin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22221-22226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), although this activation may involve subcellular localization. Finally, the Dbl family exchange factor Vav can be activated by PIP3 (9Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), and the Dbl domain of Sos can be activated by phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) in cells (10Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Several laboratories have reported constitutive GEF activities of DH domains after deletion of the PH domain. Thus, the Sos (10Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), Vav (31Ma A.D. Brass L.F. Abrams C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and Dbl (23Zheng Y. Zangrilli D. Cerione R.A. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19017-19020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) GEFs appear to function independently of their PH domains. Indeed, the GEF activities of the DH-PH domains of Sos and Vav appear to be dependent on phosphoinositides only in the presence of an intact PH domain.Our results suggest that the Tiam1 PH domain regulates the activity of the adjacent DH domain by binding to specific lipids. Recent structural studies on DH-PH domains have shed some light on the possible molecular mechanism. Consistent with the data presented here, the PH domain of Trio markedly enhances the activity of the contiguous DH domain when compared with the activity of the isolated DH domain (28Liu X. Wang H. Eberstadt M. Schnuchel A. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Schkeryantz J.M. Janowick D.A. Harlan J.E. Harris E.A.S. Staunton D.E. Fesik S.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 269-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). NMR experiments show that the PH domain does not induce major structural changes in the DH domain. Rather, effects on activity are probably due to new binding interactions at the interface of the PH domain with the DH domain. Indeed, the crystal structure of the DH-PH tandem from Sos reveals important interactions between these two domains (29Soisson S.M. Nimnual A.S. Uy M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 95: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Previous PH-lipid structural determinations indicate that the lipid binds to the PH domain at a site distal to the interaction surface with the DH domain. Taken together, these structural studies predict that effects of lipid binding on exchange activity occur via allosteric remodeling of the DH-GTPase-binding site (29Soisson S.M. Nimnual A.S. Uy M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 95: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).Sf9 cell-produced hTiam1 is only active in the presence of lipids and is specific for Rac1. In contrast, it has been reported that exchange on both Rac and Cdc42 in vitro is stimulated by mTiam1 partially purified from COS7 cells without the addition of lipids (27Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The basis for this difference is unclear. It is possible that the Tiam1 preparations differ in their association with endogenous cellular lipids. It is interesting to note, however, that Tiam1 activity in cells is specifically blocked by dominant-negative Rac and not by dominant-negative Cdc42 (27Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Rac specificity of lipid-stimulated Tiam1 in vitro is consistent with its specificity in cells.Tiam1 lacking the C-terminal PH domain could not induce lamellipodia in cells (Fig. 5, E, F, K, andL). It has previously been reported that a 14-amino acid deletion in the C-terminal portion of this PH domain does not hamper the ability of mTiam1 to induce ruffling in NIH3T3 cells (54Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Ruuls-Van Stalle L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, Ref. 54Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Ruuls-Van Stalle L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar also reported that a larger deletion of this PH domain does abrogate ruffling induction, which is consistent with our finding. In our microinjection experiments, the N-terminal PH domain was not absolutely necessary for lamellipodial induction but greatly enhanced the ability of Tiam1 to do so (Fig. 5). However, Ref. 54Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Ruuls-Van Stalle L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J.

Promoter analyses demonstrate that the proximal E box element serves as a myogenin binding site and is both necessary and sufficient to control caveolin-3 gene transcription. Transient transfection assays indicated that overexpression of myogenin activates caveolin-3 reporter gene expression, whereas Id2 overexpression inhibited caveolin-3 promoter activation by myogenin.

Lateral assemblies of lipids in the plasma membrane, referred to as “rafts,” represent such subdomains, which can be isolated as detergent insoluble glycolipid-enriched domains (DIGs) by sucrose gradient centrifugation (1Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8012) Google Scholar, 2Parton R.G. Simons K. Science. 1995; 269: 1398-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Several signaling molecules including Gα subunits are associated with the DIG fraction. The plasma membrane pits, caveolae, represent a specialized DIG domain characterized by the expression of caveolin-1 (3Rothberg K. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.-S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W.

Caveolae consist of small cholesterol and glycosphingolipid-enriched invaginations of the plasma membrane, which were shown to contain a number of molecules known to participate in cell signaling. These include Src-like kinases, Ha-ras heterotrimeric G-proteins, and epidermal growth factor receptors (4Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

During early muscle development, both caveolae-like structures and caveolin-3 are associated with the formation of T-tubules, suggesting involvement of caveolin-3 in the biogenesis of the T-tubule system during muscle differentiation (9Parton R.G.

Immunoprecipitation studies have revealed an association of caveolin-3 with the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. This complex serves as a link between the extracellular matrix of striated muscle, the membrane, and actin located in the cytoplasm.

In response to serum reduction the C2C12 myoblasts withdraw from the cell cycle and fuse to form multinuclear myotubes (13Yun K. Wold B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The myogenic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors MyoD, myogenin, Myf5, and MRF4, known as muscle regulatory factors (MRFs),1 act at multiple stages of myogenic differentiation to establish myoblast identity and to control terminal differentiation of the muscle. MRFs also induce transcription of the myocyte enhancer-binding factor-2 family of MADS box transcription factors and thereby maintain high levels of muscle-specific gene expression (14Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 755-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mice harboring a targeted mutation in the myogenin gene are immobile and die perinatally because of deficits in skeletal muscle differentiation, although normal numbers of myoblasts are present. These results indicate an essential role of myogenin in terminal differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes (15Rawls A. Morris J.H. Rudnicki M. Braun T. Arnold H.H. Klein W.H. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).bHLH transcription factors such as myogenin form heterodimers with the ubiquitously expressed E47/E12 proteins and bind to the consensus E box sequence CANNTG to mediate muscle-specific gene transcription (16Murre C.

Growth factors inhibit myoblast differentiation by activation of protein kinase C resulting in phosphorylation of the DNA-binding site of bHLH transcription factors (17Li L. Zhou J. James G. Heller-Harrison R. Czech M. Olson E.N. Cell. 1992; 71: 1181-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the inhibitor of DNA-binding Id2, a HLH protein that lacks a basic DNA-binding domain, forms heterodimers with E proteins, inhibits bHLH-mediated transcriptional activation by sequestering their dimerization partners, and thereby blocks differentiation (18Jen Y. Weintraub H. Benezra R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1466-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar).To identify and characterize important regulatory regions responsible for the tissue-specific expression pattern of caveolin-3, we cloned and characterized the human caveolin-3 promoter. In this study we demonstrate that a single E box, which is located adjacent to the 5′end of the TATA box, is required for promoter activation during muscle cell differentiation and examine the effect of myogenin and Id2 on its activity.RESULTSTo investigate muscle-specific expression of caveolin-3, the C2C12 myoblast/myotube cell line was chosen as a model system. Caveolin-3 mRNA and protein levels have been reported to increase significantly during differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts (12Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Song K. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2255-2261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Differentiation in this system is induced by serum reduction from 10% fetal bovine serum to 2% horse serum. Using a ribonuclease protection assay, we confirmed the presence of enhanced caveolin-3 mRNA 48 h after serum withdrawal (Fig.1 A). Induction of caveolin-3 protein levels visualized by immunoblots after serum withdrawal paralleled the levels of induced caveolin-3 mRNA (Fig.1 B). We also examined the subcellular localization of caveolin-3 in C2C12 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. Caveolin-3 was only detectable in vesicular structures, concentrated at the plasma membrane of the C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 1 C). The same localization pattern was observed with a caveolin-3 GFP construct in HeLa cells (data not shown). To further confirm the localization of caveolin-3 in the plasma membrane, cell lysates of mouse skeletal muscle tissue were separated into a membrane and a cytosolic fraction. Western blot analyses revealed caveolin-3 exclusively in the membrane fraction (Fig. 1 D).To study in detail the expression pattern of caveolin-3 mRNA during embryonic development, we performed in situ hybridizations to paraffin-embedded murine embryo specimens. To avoid signals resulting from cross hybridization with other members of the highly homologous caveolin family, a specific cRNA probe was prepared from the 3′-untranslated region of the mouse caveolin-3 mRNA. In mouse embryos dissected at stages E10, E11, E12, and E15 (Fig.2) caveolin-3 expression was detected in skeletal and heart muscle. The earliest signal was found in the myocardial wall of the common ventricular heart chamber (Fig.2 A, arrowhead). Fig. 2 B displays a sagittal section of a mouse embryo of gestational stage E11. Here, caveolin-3 mRNA is detectable in the heart, most prominently in the wall of the bulbus cordis (asterisk). Also faint signals are visible in the right atrial chamber. The somites at this time clearly show caveolin-3 expression (arrowheads). During the next days of development (Fig. 2, C and D) caveolin-3 was expressed with increasing intensity in all recognizable skeletal muscles, very prominently in the tongue, and even in the small muscles of the facial whisker pads. The entire myocardium at day 15 showed strong signals (Fig. 2 D). Interestingly, no caveolin-3 expression was detected in tissues containing smooth muscle such as the urinary bladder, stomach and intestinal wall (Fig. 2 D,asterisk). In summary, results of in situhybridizations revealed that in vivo caveolin-3 expression is restricted to striated muscle, both in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues, and is induced late during differentiation.Figure 2In situ hybridizations of murine embryo tissue sections with a caveolin-3-specific probe.

Previous 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR analysis indicated a single transcription start for the caveolin-3 gene (8Biederer C. Ries S. Drobnik W. Schmitz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1406: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We determined the exact position of the caveolin-3 start site by RNase protection assay using an antisense RNA probe derived from genomic DNA spanning almost 200 bp upstream of the translational initiation codon and corresponding to −197 to +77 bp. This probe was hybridized to 10 μg of human skeletal muscle RNA or tRNA as negative control and RNase-treated to cleave single-stranded RNA. A sequencing reaction was loaded on the same gel to allow the accurate determination of the product size (Fig.3 B). One strong signal was detectable confirming one major transcription start 81 nucleic acid residues upstream of the translational start codon. As displayed in Fig. 3 A, a consensus TATA box was identified 34 bp 5′ of the transcriptional start site. In a computer homology search for other cis-acting regulatory motifs that have been implicated in skeletal muscle gene regulation, we identified four consensus E box elements that represent putative binding sites for basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors (Fig. 3 A, underlined). To investigate which of these motifs are required for activation of the caveolin-3 promoter in response to skeletal muscle cell differentiation, we cloned a series of human caveolin-3 promoter deletion constructs into the promoterless luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3 Basic (Promega). These reporter constructs were transiently transfected into C2C12 cells, and luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection (Fig.4, bars a–f). Cotransfection of a thymidine kinase promoter driven Renilla luciferase reporter construct (Promega) was used to normalize for transfection efficiency in each experiment. As shown in Fig. 4, all promoter constructs L1 to L5, but not L6, supported high levels of reporter gene expression in C2C12 cells following serum withdrawal for 48 h. These results suggested that L6 lacks a cis-regulatory element mediating muscle-specific caveolin-3 expression. Because the most 3′ E box at position −64 is deleted in the L6 construct, we further investigated a specific function for this element followingin vitro mutagenesis. Consistently, deletion of the E boxes at positions −793, −585, and −5417 showed no effect on the transcriptional activity of the promoter reporter constructs (data not shown), but deletion of the E box 1 in the L5 promoter construct resulted in significant decrease of promoter activity (Fig. 4,bar g). To determine whether one of the distal E boxes can substitute for the loss of E box 1, we generated a full-length promoter construct harboring a specific deletion of E box 1 (L1mut). As shown in Fig. 4 (bar h) deletion of E box 1 led to almost complete inactivation of caveolin-3 promoter function in C2C12 cells. These experiments highlight the importance of E box 1 (CAGCTG) located at position −64 adjacent to the TATA box.Figure 3Promoter sequence and mRNA start site of the human caveolin-3 gene. A, the caveolin-3 promoter sequence was cloned using the genome walker kit libraries (CLONTECH). Four E box motifs are marked inbold type and underlined. The TATA box is displayed in bold type, the cytidine at the mRNA start site is printed in italic bold type, and the ATG start codon is in bold type and double-underlined. B, the transcriptional start site (TS) was mapped performing an RNase protection assay using a cRNA probe derived from a genomic fragment spanning from 197 bp upstream of the initiation start codon to +77 bp downstream.

To ensure that the transcriptional induction of the caveolin-3 promoter activity is due to the differentiation process and not to serum withdrawal, the L5 and L6 constructs were transfected into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and cultured in medium supplemented with 2% or 10% fetal calf serum. As shown in Fig. 4 (bars j andk), both reporter plasmids were inactive under either condition. In summary, we concluded from these results that the E box 1 harbors an important cis-regulatory element that controls muscle-specific transcription of the caveolin-3 gene in differentiated C2C12 cells.Because E box elements are known to serve as binding sites for myogenic bHLH transcription factors, we examined the influence of the muscle regulatory factor myogenin, which is is induced in C2C12 upon serum withdrawal and plays an essential role in myoblast terminal differentiation (15Rawls A. Morris J.H. Rudnicki M. Braun T. Arnold H.H. Klein W.H. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), on caveolin-3 promoter activity. The luciferase reporter construct L1, which includes the entire 5′-flanking region was cotransfected with a myogenin expressing plasmid. Myogenin expression was verified by Western blot analysis (data not shown). As displayed in Fig. 5 overexpression of myogenin dramatically increased the caveolin-3 promoter activity in undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts. In the differentiated C2C12 myocytes, myogenin was sufficient to induce caveolin-3 expression.Figure 5Cotransfection of myogenin, Id2, and the caveolin-3 promoter construct L1 into C2C12 and NIH3T3 cells. 1 μg of L1 reporter plasmid was transiently transfected with 100 ng of each expression plasmid as indicated below the bars. Id2 dHLH represents an HLH-domain mutant Id2 that fails to interact with HLH proteins. Immediately after transfection one fraction of C2C12 cells was cultured in 2% horse serum containing medium (gray bars), whereas the other fraction was continuously maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum medium (black bars). Luciferase activity was determined 48 h after transfection. Expression of myogenin, Id2, and the mutant Id2 was verified by Western blot analysis (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Overexpression of myogenin in NIH3T3 fibroblasts causes a myocyte phenotype (23Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also investigated the consequence of myogenin overexpression in 3T3 cells on the L1 caveolin-3 promoter activity. Consistently, myogenin transfection into NIH3T3 cells resulted in induction of caveolin-3 promoter activation (Fig. 5). Serum starvation of myogenin-transfected NIH3T3 cells (0.1% serum) resulted in an even enhanced transactivation of the caveolin-3 promoter (data not shown). This effect may be explained by reduced levels of Id2 expression levels in starved NIH3T3 cells.Id genes function as inhibitors of differentiation by forming inactive heterodimers with basic HLH proteins and thereby blocking bHLH-mediated transactivation of differentiation-specific gene expression (18Jen Y. Weintraub H. Benezra R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1466-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of the L1 construct with an Id2 expression plasmid (21Florio M. Hernandez M.C. Yang H. Shu H.K. Cleveland J.L. Israel M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5435-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) in C2C12 cells revealed suppression of L1 reporter gene transcription, following serum withdrawal. Cotransfection of myogenin expression plasmid also failed to induce caveolin-3 promoter activity in the presence of Id2 (Fig. 5). A mutant Id2, which lacks the HLH domain and is defective in heterodimerization with bHLH factors, was not capable of suppressing myogenin-induced activation of the caveolin-3 promoter or activation ocurring as a result of serum withdrawal (Fig. 5). These results demonstrate that activation of the human caveolin-3 promoter occurs in the presence of the myogenic bHLH transcription factor myogenin and can be blocked by HLH interactions with inhibitory dimerization partners such as Id2.To analyze DNA-protein complexes interacting with E box 1, synthetic oligonucleotides forming a double-stranded E box 1-binding site were annealed and used for electromobility shift assays (Fig.6). In addition, a second oligomeric-binding site was synthesized containing point mutations in the E box 1 consensus sequence as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” The wild type E box 1 oligomere formed a single band shift that was present exclusively in C2C12 myotube but not in myoblast nuclear extracts (Fig. 6, lanes 2–4). A significant portion of this band shift was further retarded upon addition of myogenin antibody (Fig. 6, lane 7) but not upon addition of an unrelated c-Fos antibody that served as a negative control (Fig.6, lane 8). Further competition experiments with 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild type and mutated oligomeric-binding sites were performed to control the specificity of the band shift experiments. Incubation of the binding reaction with unlabeled wild type binding site completely inhibited detection of the retarded complex (Fig. 6, lane 5), whereas a 50-fold molar excess of mutated binding site had no effect on the the band shift (Fig. 6,lane 6). Taken together these data define thecis-regulatory element E box 1 located at position −64 in the caveolin-3 promoter as a myogenin-binding site.Figure 6Gel shift assays with C2C12 nuclear extracts and the E box 1-binding site of the caveolin-3 promoter. Lane 1 shows the binding site without addition of nuclear extracts. Differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts (lane 2) was initiated by culturing the cells in medium containing 2% horse serum for 24 h (lane 3) or 48 h (lanes 4–8).Lanes 5 and 6 show competition with 50-fold excess cold wild type (lane 5) and mutant (lane 6) oligonucleotides. 2 μl of myogenin antibody (DAKO, lane 7) or c-fos antibody (Geneka, lane 8) were added to the reaction containing 48 h differentiated C2C12 nuclear extracts.

As shown in Fig. 7 (top panel) MyoD was expressed in both undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 cells, whereas myogenin expression was specifically detected in differentiated C2C12 cells 48 h after serum withdrawal. In parallel the Id2 level decreased during the muscle differentiation process (bottom panel), strongly suggesting a physiological role as an inhibitor of differentiation.Figure 7Expression of transcriptional regulators of the myogenic differentiation program in C2C12 cells. Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts from undifferentiated or 24 h or 48 h differentiated C2C12 cells. 20 μg of protein lysates were immunoprobed with affinity-purified antibodies against MyoD (mouse monoclonal, DAKO), myogenin (mouse monoclonal, Pharmingen), or Id2 (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz). Equal loading of the lanes was confirmed by reprobing with an antibody against β-actin (mouse monoclonal; Sigma).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further determine whether Id2 functions as a negative regulator of caveolin-3 promoter activity in vivo, we compared expression patterns of Id2 and caveolin-3 in the dermatomyotome of developing somites and differentiated skeletal muscle tissue by in situhybridization to murine embryos. As shown in Fig.8, we observed very strong Id2 signals in undifferentiated muscle precursor cells at gestational age E10 but not in differentiated skeletal muscle at gestational age E16. Vice versa, caveolin-3 expression was absent in Id2-positive myoblasts but very high in Id2-negative differentiated muscle tissues. These results further point to myogenin as an important regulator of caveolin-3 expression because induction of myogenin and concomitant decrease in the level of the myogenic inhibitor Id2 parallel the pattern of caveolin-3 expression during differentiation of myoblasts.Figure 8Reciprocal expression patterns of Id2 and caveolin-3 in myoblasts and differentiated myocytes.

Ries S. Drobnik W. Schmitz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1406: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this report we cloned and characterized the human caveolin-3 promoter and identified an importantcis-regulatory E box element controling caveolin-3 gene transcription during skeletal muscle differentiation. Our results provide conclusive evidence that the formation of an active transcription complex on the caveolin-3 promoter in mouse C2C12 myotubes is critically dependent on binding of the bHLH transcription factor myogenin to the E box 1 located adjacent to the TATA box.For our study we used the C2C12 myoblast/myotube system because these cells display many of the morphological and genetic characteristics of the skeletal muscle differentiation program. In these cells caveolin-3 expression parallels the in vivo expression pattern observed during embryonic differentiation. Formation of myotubes from C2C12 myoblasts induced by serum withdrawal is accompanied by transcriptional induction of muscle-specific genes (14Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N. J. Biol.

Corroborative results were also obtained from membrane binding competition and subcellular fractionation studies along with binding studies to membranes prepared from strains overproducing SecYE protein.

For example, the importance of soluble and phospholipid-bound pools of SecA relative to the SecYE-bound pool for the initial preprotein recognition step has not been defined, and differences have been reported forin vivo and in vitro studies (24Chun S.Y. Randall L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4197-4203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Fekkes P. van der Does C. Driessen A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13898-13904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although SecA membrane cycling has generally been accepted, different views exist about the specifics; there is a report that protein translocation can occur from membrane-inserted SecA that does not undergo repetitive cycles of insertion and retraction (27Chen X. Xu H. Tai P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29698-29706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). There is also a recent finding that proton-motive force can stimulate deinsertion of SecA from the membrane, raising the question of whether it also serves as an alternative energy source for the late stage of protein translocation as originally proposed (28Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.-U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 29Nishiyama K. Fukuda A. Morita K. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1049-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). One approach to dissecting the reaction cycle of a complex biochemical system is to create altered proteins that allow characterization of functional sites of interaction or identification of important biochemical intermediates. This approach has recently provided new information about translocon structure and function (30van der Wolk J. Fekkes P. Boorsma A. Huie J. Silhavy T. Driessen A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3263-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 32Harris C. Silhavy T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3438-3444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such an approach seems particularly appropriate for the large multifunctional SecA protein that plays a dynamic role in the translocase reaction cycle. Previous studies have shown that SecA contains both high and low affinity nucleotide-binding domains, a preprotein-binding site, a SecY-binding site, and a region that interacts with SecB and phospholipids (8Kimura E. Akita M. Matsuyama S.-I. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6600-6606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Mitchell C. Oliver D.B. Mol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7902-7907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Beyond localization of the various ligand-binding sites on SecA, it is important to clarify the dynamics of SecA conformational states and its relation to the translocation process. For instance, the 30-kDa C-terminal region of SecA undergoes membrane cycling at SecYE, where in the membrane-inserted state the C terminus is periplasmically accessible (15Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 36van der Does C. den Blaauwen T. de Wit J. Manting E. Groot N. Fekkes P. Driessen A. Mol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23239-23246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, because the C terminus contains the SecB- and phospholipid-binding sites, it must have been oriented toward the cytoplasm and/or inner membrane prior to insertion. To clarify the initial membrane binding step of SecA with reference to SecA structure, we have genetically engineered two SecA truncates, SecA-N664 and SecA-619C, that correspond approximately to previously described 65-kDa N-terminal and 30-kDa C-terminal proteolytic fragments of SecA (denoted N and C domain), respectively (38Cabelli R. Biochemical Characterization of the Role of SecA Protein in Protein Export in Escherichia coli. Ph.D. Thesis. State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY1991Google Scholar, 39Price A. Economou A. Duong F. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31580-31584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We have characterized the membrane binding properties of these recombinant proteins. The results indicate that the specific interaction of SecA with the translocon occurs through its N domain and that the C domain, although important in SecA membrane cycling at a later stage of translocation, appears to initially increase its membrane binding by interaction with phospholipids. E. coli BL21.19 ((λDE3) secA13(Am) supF (Ts) trp(Am) zch::Tn10 recA::CAT clpA::KAN) (9Mitchell C. Oliver D.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), is a derivative of BL21(λDE3) (40Studier W.F. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) and was used as the host forsecA-containing plasmids. pT7secA2 (41Rajapandi T. Dolan K.M. Oliver D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7092-7097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pT7secA75, and pT7secA-619C were used for production of SecA, SecA-N664, and SecA-619C, respectively. pT7secA75 is a derivative of pT7secA2 that contains an ochre mutation at codon 665 of secA (34Snyders S. Ramamurthy V. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11302-11306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). pT7secA-619C is a derivative of pET-14b (Novagen) that contains a portion of secA from codon 619–901 in frame with the N-terminal histidine tag under control of the T7 φ10 promoter on the vector. For construction of this plasmid, the secA DNA fragment was produced by polymerase chain reaction amplification utilizing pT7secA2 and primers 5′-GAATCAACATATGGAACACCCGTGGGTGAC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTTATTGCAGGCGGCC-3′, which introduced an NdeI site upstream of position 1857 of secA and a BamHI site after the secA stop codon, respectively. The DNA fragment was cleaved with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pET-14b. The plasmid was confirmed by restriction enzyme and DNA sequence analysis. CK1801 (Δ(uncB-C)) is a derivative of MC4100 (42Casadaban M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 541-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar) that was obtained from C. Kumamoto (Tufts University) and was used for preparation of IMV.1 CK1801 (pSE420secYEG) was used to prepare IMV containing elevated SecYEG levels. pSE420secEYG is a derivative of pSE420 (Invitrogen) carrying the secEYG genes. It was constructed as follows: (i) a secE DNA fragment was produced by polymerase chain reaction amplification utilizing pHAsecEYG(43Douville K. Price A. Eichler J. Economou A. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20106-20111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and primers 5′-ATTCACCATGGTATACCCATACG-3′ (which introduced a 5′NcoI site) and 5′-CCAATACGGAACACA-3′ and digested withNcoI and SalI, (ii) a secYG DNA fragment was produced by digesting pHAsecEYG withSalI and HindIII, and (iii) pSE420 was digested with NcoI and HindIII. The appropriate DNA fragments were purified using Elu-Quik and ligated together. pSE420secEYG was isolated after transformation and purification, and it was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Na125I (100 mCi/ml) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and Iodogen (1, 3, 4, 6-tetrachloro-3α, 6α-diphenylglycoluril)-coated tubes were obtained from Pierce. Molecular mass markers used in gel filtration studies were purchased from Sigma. SecA and SecA-N664 were purified from S300 extracts of BL21.19 (pT7secA2) and BL21.19 (pT7secA75), respectively, by affinity chromatography on Cibacron Blue-agarose as described previously (9Mitchell C. Oliver D.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), with one notable exception; all solutions used for SecA-N664 purification contained 20% glycerol. His-tagged SecA-619C was purified from S300 extracts of BL21.19 (pT7secA-619C) by nickel affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). A Superose 6 HR 10/30 column was used for gel filtration of SecA, SecA-N664, and the mixture of SecA-N664 and SecA-619C, whereas a Superose 12 HR 10/30 was used for SecA-619C. Gel filtration was carried out at 4 °C using a Waters 650E fast protein liquid chromatography system. The columns were equilibrated with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mmKCl, 10 mm Mg[OAc]2, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol prior to addition of 100 μg of purified SecA. An equimolar mixture of SecA-N664/SecA-619C was incubated on ice for 30 min prior to loading onto the gel filtration column that had been equilibrated with an equivalent buffer containing 300 mmKCl. IMV were prepared from CK1801 or CK1801 (pSE420secYEG) as described previously (44Rhoads D. Tai P.C. Davis B. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 63-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and washed with 6 m urea (30 min at 0 °C) to inactivate endogenous SecA (45Cunningham K. Lill R. Crooke E. Rice M. Moore K. Wickner W. Oliver D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The concentration of total membrane protein in IMV was determined by using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) after solubilization of IMV in 0.1% SDS. The biological activity of IMV was tested by in vitro protein translocation assays utilizing125I-proOmpA as substrate (46Cunningham K. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8630-8634Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Purified SecA, SecA-N664, and SecA-619C were labeled with Na125I using Iodo-gen precoated iodination tubes by the direct method (47Markwell M. Fox C. Biochem. 1978; 17: 4807-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) to the specific activity of 0.6 × 106–1.0 × 106 cpm/pmol. Free iodine was removed utilizing Sephadex G-25 micro-spin columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Binding of125I-SecA proteins to urea-treated IMV was performed as described previously (6Hartl F.-U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Briefly, urea-treated IMV (200 μg/ml) was mixed with increasing amounts of 125I- SecA (0–1000 nm) in buffer A (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 30 mm KCl, 30 mm NH4Cl, 2.5 mm Mg[OAc]2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in a total volume of 100 μl. After 15 min of incubation on ice, the reaction mixture was overlaid on an equal volume of buffer A containing 0.2 m sucrose and sedimented at 320,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was rinsed with 200 μl of buffer A followed by quantification of radioactivity with a γ-counter (Beckman 5500). Competition binding assays were performed by using a constant amount of 125I-SecA (130 nm) mixed with increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor (0–12.5 μm), and binding of 125I-SecA to IMV (200 μg/ml) was assayed as described above. For measurement of reconstitution of membrane binding activity, an equimolar mixture of SecA-N664 and SecA-619C was allowed to reassociate for 10 min on ice prior to addition of IMV to the reaction. Binding parameters were analyzed using Prism 2.0 software (Graph Pad Software, Inc.), and the binding values represent means of three independent measurements. Binding functions were determined using nonlinear regression to the following equation: Y = (B max X)/(K d +X), where Y represents the molar amount of SecA protein bound to IMV and X represents the free SecA concentration in solution. B max is the maximum specific binding to be fit, and K d is the equilibrium dissociation constant. The partition coefficient is defined as the ratio of the concentration of ligand in aqueous and lipid phases (48Winzor D. Sawyer W. Quantitative Characterization of Ligand Binding. Wiley-Liss, New York1995Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined via curve fitting of total binding and was estimated to constitute 5% of total binding. The affinity of receptor for competing ligand (K i) was calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (49Cheng Y. Prusoff W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar): K i = EC50/(1 + [radioligand]/K d), whereK i is the concentration of competitor that will bind to half of the binding sites at equilibrium and EC50 is the concentration of competitor that competes for half of the specific binding. Because no detectable background binding of SecA was observed, uncorrected data were used. BL21(λDE3) carrying pT7secA2, pT7secA75, or pT7secA-619C was grown in LB (50Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431-435Google Scholar) supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to early logarithmic phase and when appropriate induced for SecA overproduction by addition of IPTG to 0.1 mm for 45 min. Cells were harvested, disrupted in the French pressure cell, and subjected to subcellular fractionation as described previously (51Kim Y.J. Rajapandi T. Oliver D. Cell. 1994; 78: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Proteolysis studies indicate that SecA can be divided into primary N and C domains of 65 and 30 kDa, respectively, (38Cabelli R. Biochemical Characterization of the Role of SecA Protein in Protein Export in Escherichia coli. Ph.D. Thesis. State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY1991Google Scholar, 39Price A. Economou A. Duong F. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31580-31584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The 65-kDa N domain contains the high and low affinity nucleotide-binding domains of SecA flanking its proposed preprotein-binding site (8Kimura E. Akita M. Matsuyama S.-I. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6600-6606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Mitchell C. Oliver D.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 33Matsuyama S. Kimura E. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8760-8765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the 30-kDa C domain contains the region that undergoes membrane cycling as well as binding of SecB and phospholipids (15Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 25Fekkes P. van der Does C. Driessen A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7902-7907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We created T7 expression plasmids that produce similar N- and C-terminal SecA truncates (Fig.1). The N-terminal truncate comprises residues 1–664 of the primary structure (molecular mass = ∼75 kDa) and is referred to as SecA-N664 (34Snyders S. Ramamurthy V. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11302-11306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The C-terminal truncate contains residues 619–901 (molecular mass = ∼32 kDa) and is referred to as SecA-619C. Both proteins were stably produced in vivo (see Fig. 7 A below), where they lacked protein translocation activity as assessed by the inability to complement the growth defect of the secA13(Am) supF(Ts) mutant BL21.19 at 42 °C. They also showed protein secretion defects in this strain background at 42 °C when chromosomally derived SecA was no longer synthesized (results not shown).Figure 7Subcellular localization of SecA truncates. A, BL21(λDE3) containing the plasmid producing the indicated SecA protein was grown, induced with 0.1 mm IPTG for 45 min where indicated (+ IPTG), and subjected to subcellular fractionation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Western blots of SecA, SecA-N664, and SecA-619C are shown, along with Western blots of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and OmpA for the strain overproducing SecA protein. Total cell (T), cytosolic (C), peripheral membrane (P), and integral membrane (I) fractions are displayed. Similar results were obtained in four different experiments. B, IMV were prepared from the appropriate strains that had been induced with 0.1 mm IPTG for 45 min. 10 μg of total protein of IMV or crude cellular extract (Total) was analyzed by Western blotting with SecA antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To characterize the membrane binding properties of SecA-N664 and SecA-619C, the proteins were purified from BL21.19 containing the appropriate T7 expression plasmid. SecA-N664 was purified similarly to SecA by its affinity for Cibacron Blue, which binds to nucleotide-binding proteins (Fig.2 A). SecA-619C was engineered to contain a His tag at its N terminus, allowing for rapid affinity purification on a nickel column. The ATPase activities of the purified proteins were quantified as described previously (9Mitchell C. Oliver D.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). SecA normally possesses a low endogenous ATPase activity that is stimulated modestly by binding IMV (termed membrane ATPase activity) and a robust ATPase activity that is induced by binding IMV and an export-competent preprotein (termed translocation ATPase activity) (5Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). SecA-N664 possessed 2-fold higher endogenous ATPase activity and half of the normal level of membrane ATPase activity compared with SecA protein, but it lacked measurable translocation ATPase activity (data not shown). The membrane ATPase activity of SecA-N664, albeit lower then for SecA, suggests that this protein can still interact with SecYE because SecA membrane ATPase activity as opposed to its lipid ATPase activity requires the presence of SecYE protein (7Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 43Douville K. Price A. Eichler J. Economou A. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20106-20111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). SecA-619C lacked any detectable ATPase activity, consistent with the absence of a nucleotide-binding domain in this protein (9Mitchell C. Oliver D.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The oligomeric state of the two SecA truncates was characterized by gel filtration studies. Both SecA-N664 and SecA-619C eluted with an apparent molecular size of 65 kDa (Fig. 2, B and C); this is consistent with a monomer and dimer subunit structure, respectively. These results are in agreement with a previous study demonstrating that the C-terminal region of SecA is necessary and sufficient for dimerization, and that similar N- and C-terminal SecA truncates existed as monomer and dimer, respectively (52Hirano M. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 53Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Slanidis G. Baud C. Roos T. Kuhn A. Politou A. Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 35: 1133-1145Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The observed leading shoulder in the SecA-N664 elution profile may be due to different protein conformational states, or, alternatively, it may reflect heterogeneity at the primary structural level because of proteolytic degradation at the N terminus of SecA as observed previously (54Mori H, S.H. Yamanaka M Sato K Tagaya M Mizushima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Finally, when SecA-N664 and SecA-619C were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio and analyzed by gel filtration, they eluted at a position similar to SecA protein (Fig.2 D). This indicated that SecA-N664 and SecA-619C were capable of association, consistent with a recently published result with similar SecA truncates (53Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Slanidis G. Baud C. Roos T. Kuhn A. Politou A. Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 35: 1133-1145Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Previous studies have established that SecA dimer binds with high affinity to SecYE (K d = 40 nm) and with low affinity to phospholipids (6Hartl F.-U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 7Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 55Ulbrandt N. London E. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15184-15192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the membrane binding properties of SecA-N664 and SecA-619C, we measured their binding to IMV utilizing established methods (6Hartl F.-U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The binding analysis showed that SecA-N664 bound to IMV with a K d of 270 nm, which was approximately 4-fold higher than that of SecA protein (K d = 75 nm) (Fig.3, A and B). This result may be due to the monomeric state of SecA-N664 or, alternatively, to the missing C-terminal region, which could contribute to binding affinity in either a direct or indirect fashion. The membrane binding density of SecA-N664 was also higher than that of SecA protein (1490 pmol/mg membrane protein versus 652 pmol/mg membrane protein, respectively), because at this lower binding affinity, phospholipid binding contributed significantly to the binding density. Binding of SecA-619C to IMV was found to be nonspecific and nonsaturable, consistent with phospholipid association (Fig.3 C). SecA-619C binding was described by a partition coefficient (k p = 0.47 ± 0.01), and this value was obtained from the slope of the binding isotherm (Fig.3 C). To determine whether SecA-N664 binds to IMV through the same type of receptor as wild type SecA protein as well as to confirm our results with SecA-619C, we performed competition binding studies.

https://openalex.org/W1595420782,"Increased expression of prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase-2 (PGHS-2) has been implicated in pathological conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases and colon cancer. Recently, it has been demonstrated that inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS II) expression and nitric oxide (NO) production are up-regulated in these diseases as well. However, the apparent link between PGHS-2 and NOS II has not been thoroughly investigated in nontransformed and nontumorigenic colonic epithelial cells. In the present study, we examined the concomitant expression of PGHS-2 and NOS II as well as the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and NO in conditionally immortalized mouse colonic epithelial cells, namely YAMC (Apc(+/+)). We found that the induction of PGHS-2 and generation of PGE2 in these cells by IFN-gamma and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were greatly reduced by two selective NOS II inhibitors, L-NIL and SMT. To ascertain the effect of NO on PGHS-2 overexpression, we tested NO-releasing compounds, NOR-1 and SNAP, and found that they caused PGHS-2 expression and PGE2 production. This effect was abolished by hemoglobin, a NO scavenger. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we found that both NOR-1 and SNAP caused beta-catenin/LEF-1 DNA complex formation. Super-shift by anti-beta-catenin antibody confirmed the presence of beta-catenin in the complex. Cell fractionation studies indicated that NO donors caused an increase in free soluble cytoplasmic beta-catenin. This is further corroborated by the immunocytochemistry data showing the redistribution of beta-catenin from the predominantly membrane localization into the cytoplasm and nucleus after treatment with NO donors. To further explore the possible connection between PGHS-2 expression and beta-catenin/LEF-1 DNA complex formation, we studied IMCE (Apc(Min/+)) cells, a sister cell line of YAMC with similar genetic background but differing in Apc genotype and, consequently, their beta-catenin levels. We found that IMCE cells, in comparison with YAMC cells, had markedly higher beta-catenin/LEF-1 DNA complex formation under both resting conditions as well as after induction with NO. In parallel fashion, IMCE cells expressed significantly higher levels of PGHS-2 mRNA and protein, and generated more PGE2. Overall, this study suggests that NO may be involved in PGHS-2 overexpression in conditionally immortalized mouse colonic epithelial cells. Although the molecular mechanism of the link is still under investigation, this effect of NO appears directly or indirectly to be a result of the increase in free soluble beta-catenin and the formation of nuclear beta-catenin/LEF-1 DNA complex."
https://openalex.org/W2037664098,"Chronic exposure to ethanol increases the number of functional L-type voltage-gated calcium channels in neural cells. In PC12 cells, this adaptive response is mediated by protein kinase C δ (PKCδ), but the mechanisms by which this occurs are not known. Since expression of several different calcium channel subunits can increase the abundance of functional L-type channels, we sought to identify which subunits are regulated by ethanol. Incubation of PC12 cells with 120–150 mm ethanol for 6 days increased levels of α1C, α2, and β1b subunit immunoreactivity in cell membranes and selectively increased the abundance of mRNA encoding the α1C-1 splice variant of α1C. In cells expressing a fragment of PKCδ (δV1) that selectively inhibits PKCδ, there was no increase in membrane-associated α1C, α2, and β1b immunoreactivity following chronic ethanol exposure. However, ethanol still increased levels of α1C-1 mRNA in these cells. These results indicate that ethanol increases the abundance of L-type channels by at least two mechanisms; one involves increases in mRNA encoding a splice variant of α1Cand the other is post-transcriptional, rate-limiting, and requires PKCδ. Chronic exposure to ethanol increases the number of functional L-type voltage-gated calcium channels in neural cells. In PC12 cells, this adaptive response is mediated by protein kinase C δ (PKCδ), but the mechanisms by which this occurs are not known.

L-type channels are a subfamily of voltage-gated calcium channels that are activated by high voltage, inactivate slowly, and are blocked by dihydropyridines (DHPs).1 Acute ethanol exposure inhibits the function of L-type channels in several neuronal preparations (3Mullikin-Kilpatrick D.

In contrast, in the neural crest-derived cell line PC12, chronic ethanol exposure produces a reversible concentration- and time-dependent increase in K+-evoked45Ca2+ uptake and depolarization-evoked calcium currents through L-type channels (6Skattebol A.

Ethanol-induced increases in L-type channel function are associated with corresponding increases in the density of binding sites for DHP calcium channel antagonists (6Skattebol A. Rabin R. Biochem.

Similar increases in DHP binding have been detected in brain membranes from ethanol-dependent rodents (9Dolin S. Little H. Hudspith M. Pagonis C. Littleton J. Neuropharmacology. 1987; 26: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 10Guppy L.J. Crabbe J.C. Littleton J.M. Alcohol Alcohol. 1995; 30: 607-615PubMed Google Scholar). Up-regulation of L-type calcium channels appears to contribute to intense neuronal hyperexcitability observed during alcohol withdrawal since L channel antagonists reduce tremors, seizures, and mortality in alcohol-dependent rodents deprived of ethanol (11Little H.J.

Psychopharmacology. 1989; 99: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Ethanol-induced increases in L-type channels may also promote alcohol consumption since L channel antagonists reduce ethanol self-administration in animals (13Fadda F. Garau B. Colombo G. Gessa G.L.

Neuronal voltage-gated calcium channels are multimeric complexes of at least three types of subunits as follows: α1, α2δ, and β (2Dunlap K. Luebke J.I. Turner T.J. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 89-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Diversity within the α1subunit family is responsible for the major pharmacological and physiological features that distinguish the different classes of calcium channels. α1 subunits contain the calcium pore and binding sites for selective channel antagonists. They are comprised of four homologous repeats (I–IV) each containing six transmembrane segments (S1–S6). Four L-type channel α1 genes have been cloned thus far as follows: α1S from skeletal muscle (17Hogan K. Gregg R.G. Powers P.A. Genomics. 1996; 31: 392-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), α1C from heart and brain (18Snutch T.P. Tomlinson W.J. Leonard J.P. M. G.M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 45-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), α1Dfrom neural and endocrine tissues (19Williams M.E. Feldman D.H. McCue A.F. Brenner R. Velicelebi G. Ellis S.B. Harpold M.M. Neuron. 1992; 8: 71-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), and α1F from retina (20Bech-Hansen N.T. Naylor M.J. Maybaum T.A. Pearce W.G. Koop B. Fishman G.A.

In brain, α1D and α1C are localized to neuronal cell bodies and proximal dendrites (22Hell J.W. Westenbroek R.E. Warner C. Ahijanian M.K. Prystay W. Gilbert M.M. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 949-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Two splice variants of the rat α1C subunit have been identified, α1C-1 and α1C-2, and are differentially expressed in rat brain (18Snutch T.P. Tomlinson W.J. Leonard J.P. M. G.M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 45-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The α1C-2protein differs from α1C-1 by having a 3-amino acid (aa) insert in the cytoplasmic loop between domains II and III and a 28-aa substitution in the S3 segment in domain IV. In the human α1C gene, this alternatively spliced IV-S3 transmembrane segment is encoded by homologous alternative exons 31 and 32 (23Soldatov N.M. Genomics. 1994; 22: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It is not known if α1C-1 and α1C-2 differ in function. Protein kinase C (PKC) is a multigene family of phospholipid-dependent, serine-threonine kinases that regulate cell growth and differentiation, neurotransmitter release, receptor regulation, ion channel modulation, and gene expression (24Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4219) Google Scholar). Twelve PKC isozymes, encoded by 11 genes, have been identified (α, βI, βII, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, λ, μ, and ν) and differ in structure, requirements for activation, and patterns of expression (24Nishizuka Y.

McMahon T. Hundle B. Dadgar J. Messing R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16409-16414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study we examined the abundance of specific calcium channel subunits and their mRNAs to explore further the mechanisms by which PKCδ mediates up-regulation of L-type channels by ethanol. Radioisotopes and nucleotides were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Restriction endonucleases and modifying enzymes were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). JM109 (Promega) and XL-1 Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) bacteria were used. All other reagents were analytical grade and were from Sigma or Life Technologies, Inc. PC12 cells (J. Wagner, Cornell University) were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 10% horse serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine in a humidified atmosphere of 90% air and 10% CO2. Cells were cultured with 120–150 mm ethanol in tightly capped flasks, and the medium was changed daily as in prior work (28Gerstin Jr., E.H. McMahon T. Hundle B. Dadgar J. Messing R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16409-16414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Control samples were cultured in parallel without ethanol. For detection of α2 and β subunit immunoreactivity, cells were washed with PBS, solubilized in 1% digitonin, and homogenized in Buffer A containing 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.75 mm benzamide, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.01 mg/ml lysozyme, and 8 mg/ml calpain 1 + 2). Cell membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation at 135,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and were resuspended in solubilization buffer containing 300 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mmEDTA, and the protease inhibitors used in Buffer A. Unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 175,000 × gfor 45 min at 4 °C. For detection of α1C and neuronal γ (stargazin (29Letts V.A. Felix R. Biddlecome G.H. Arikkath J. Mahaffey C.L. Valenzuela A. Bartlett F.S., II Mori Y. Campbell K.P. Frankel W.N. Nat.

Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Samples (80, 160, and 320 μg) of crude membrane pellet or digitonin-solubilized membranes were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose Hybond C Extra membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 100 V, and membranes were incubated in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dried milk for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation in primary antibody in the same buffer for 2 h at room temperature, or overnight at 4 °C, the blots were washed three times in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 10 min and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 1:1000 dilution) for 1 h in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature. Calcium channel subunit immunoreactivity was detected by chemiluminescence with ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoreactive bands were quantified by densitometric scanning, and linear regression analysis of protein concentrations and corresponding density values was used to determine the slope of the regression line for each condition. Slopes for ethanol-treated samples were divided by slopes calculated for paired control samples to calculate the percentage increase in immunoreactivity induced by ethanol. Polyclonal antibodies against α2, β1b, β2, β3, and neuronal γ (stargazin) subunits were obtained from K. Campbell (University of Iowa) and were used at dilutions of 1:500 to 1:1000. Polyclonal antibody CARD I against α1C (1:1000) was a gift from M. Hosey (Northwestern University). Antibody against α1D(1:600) was purchased from Alomone Labs (Jerusalem, Israel). Full-length rat α1C-2cDNA (a gift from T. Snutch, University of British Columbia; GenBankTM accession number M67515) was digested withBglII and PvuII, and a 498-bp cDNA fragment (nucleotides 3691–4188) that includes the mismatch between α1C-1 and α1C-2 in the IV S3 domain (nucleotides 4098–4181 of α1C-2) was subcloned into pSP72 (Promega). A BglII-linearized plasmid was used as a template to generate a [α-32P]CTP-labeled 498-bp cRNA probe using SP6 RNA polymerase. To generate a probe for α1C-1, two oligonucleotide primers were constructed from the rat α1C-1 sequence (GenBankTM accession number M67516) to flank the mismatch between α1C-1 and α1C-2 at the IV S3 domain as follows: JD1802 (CCCAAGCTTG GGTTTGACAA TGTTCTGGCA GCC), upstream of the mismatch with a HindIII site incorporated into the sequence, and JD1803 (CGCGGATCCG CGTGACGATG AGGAAGTCAA AAAC), downstream and spanning the mismatch region, with a BamHI site incorporated into the sequence. The first strand of α1C-1 cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript Choice System for DNA synthesis kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNA (12 μg), isolated from PC12 cells, was heated to 70 °C for 10 min with 100 pmol of oligo(dT) primer (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then chilled on ice before 1× first strand buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm dNTP (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP) mix were added. The reaction was then heated for 2 min at 42 °C, and then 1 μl of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added. After incubation for 1 h at 42 °C, 2 μl of the reaction product, containing reverse-transcribed cDNA, was added to a PCR mixture containing 1× polymerase chain reaction (PCR) buffer (Perkin-Elmer), 0.5 mm dNTP mix, 2.5 units of Amplitaq (Perkin-Elmer), 100 pmol of JD1802, and 100 pmol of JD1803. The reaction mixture was heated to 94 °C for 4 min and then subjected to 30 amplification cycles. Each cycle consisted of 53 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 2 min, and 94 °C for 10 min. Finally, the mixture was incubated at 53 °C for 45 s and 2 °C for 2 min and then placed on ice. PCR products were digested with BamHI and HindIII and separated on a 1.2% agarose gel. The resultant fragments were excised and gel-purified using a QIAEX II Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Purified fragments were subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and positive colonies were sequenced. The sequence was identical to the predicted rat α1C-1sequence (nucleotides 4046–4628). A HindIII-linearized plasmid was used as a template with T3 RNA polymerase to generate a [α-32P]CTP-labeled 582-bp cRNA probe. Full-length rat β1b cDNA (a gift from E. Perez-Reyes, Loyola University, GenBankTM accession number X61394) was digested with NcoI and PstI, and the cDNA fragment (518 bp of coding sequence) was subcloned into pGEM5Zf(+) (Promega). An NcoI-linearized plasmid was used as a template with SP6 RNA polymerase to generate a [α-32P]CTP-labeled 518-bp probe. The plasmid pTRI-GAPDH-rat, which recognizes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA, was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX) and used with T7 RNA polymerase to generate a [α-32P]CTP-labeled 316-bp probe. Total RNA was extracted from PC12 cells using the RNA STAT-60 method (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. Ribonuclease protection assays (RPAs) were performed as described previously (31Walter H.J. Berry M. Hill D.J. Cwyfan-Hughes J.M. Holly J.M.P. Logan A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 520-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA (20 μg) was dissolved in 30 μl of hybridization solution containing 60,000 cpm of a 32P-labeled calcium channel subunit cRNA probe and 10,000 cpm of a 32P-labeled GAPDH cRNA probe. The cRNA probes were allowed to anneal to the endogenous RNA at 45 °C overnight. The next day, digestion was performed at 37 °C for 30 min using an RNase solution containing a final concentration of 30 μg/ml RNase A (Ambion) and 800 units of RNase T1. The RNA:RNA hybrids were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide, 8m urea sequencing gel. The gel was dried, and mRNA fragments were visualized and densities calculated using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Century Template RNA markers (Ambion) were used to determine molecular weights. Results were expressed relative to parallel control samples cultured without ethanol. Total RNA (1, 2.5, 5, and 10 μg) was prepared for analysis in sample buffer (66% formamide, 10% formaldehyde, and 1× SSC). Samples were heated to 68 °C for 15 min before an equal volume of ice-cold 20× SSC was added. BA-85 nitrocellulose membranes were loaded into a slot blot apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell) and rinsed with 500 μl/well of 10× SSC. After the samples were loaded, the apparatus was washed with 1 ml of 10× SSC under vacuum. RNA was cross-linked to damp membranes under UV light. Plasmids containing cDNA inserts encoding α2δ (50 ng; a gift from A. Schwartz, University of Cincinnati) and GAPDH (50 ng; CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were used as templates for random primer labeling using the Life Technologies, Inc., Radprime DNA labeling system. Excess radioactivity was removed by centrifugation through TE-10 columns (CLONTECH) at 700 ×g for 7 min. Membranes were placed in pre-hybridization solution (60% formamide, 3× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.82 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 82 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 1% SDS) for 4 h at 42 °C. 32P-Labeled DNA (3–5 × 106 cpm/ml) was boiled for 10 min in the presence of salmon sperm DNA (0.1 mg/ml) and placed immediately on ice. Cooled32P-labeled probes were added to pre-hybridization solution with the addition of 5% w/v dextran sulfate and 1% SDS. After an overnight incubation at 42 °C, membranes were washed at 25 °C three times in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 5 min for each wash. Radioactivity bound to the blots was quantified using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. Levels of α2δ and GAPDH mRNA increased linearly over the concentrations of samples examined. Linear regression analysis of total mRNA and corresponding hybridization signals for α2δ and GAPDH mRNA were used to calculate the slope of the regression lines for each condition. Corresponding slopes calculated for α2δ and GAPDH mRNA were divided to normalize for abundance of GAPDH mRNA. Normalized slopes for ethanol-treated and paired control samples were then compared to calculate the percentage increase in α2δ mRNA induced by ethanol. To determine which L-type calcium channel subunits are regulated by ethanol, we first identified which subunits are expressed in PC12 cells. Western analysis of PC12 cell membranes with subunit-specific antibodies demonstrated immunoreactive bands of appropriate molecular mass (32Ellis S.B. Williams M.E. Ways N.R. Brenner R. Sharp A.H.

Witcher D.R. Campbell K.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7557-7565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for α2 (140 kDa), β1b (72 kDa), and β3 (58 kDa) subunits (Fig. 1 A). We also found an 86-kDa immunoreactive band using an anti-β2 antibody (Fig. 1 A). In a prior report (33Liu H. Felix R. Gurnett C.A. De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Campbell K.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7557-7565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this antibody labeled a 74-kDa protein in Western blots of PC12 cell membranes but recognized 87-, 74-, and 70-kDa protein bands in Western blots of rat cardiac microsome membranes. A 225-kDa band was detected using the anti-α1C antibody, which recognizes a band of 240 kDa in α1C-expressing Sf9 cells (34Puri T.S. Gerhardstein B.L. Zhao X.-L. Ladner M.B. Hosey M.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9605-9615Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although we found α1D-like immunoreactivity in brain tissue, we were unable to detect immunoreactive bands of the appropriate molecular mass for this subunit in our line of PC12 cells (data not shown). This is similar to what has been previously reported by Liu and colleagues (33Liu H. Felix R. Gurnett C.A. De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Campbell K.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7557-7565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who also found that PC12 cells do not express β4subunit immunoreactivity. We also did not detect immunoreactivity for the neuronal γ (stargazin) subunit in PC12 cells (data not shown). One mechanism by which ethanol could increase the density of functional L-type calcium channels in PC12 cells is by increasing the expression of α1 subunits, which form the calcium pore. However, α2 and especially β subunits promote the assembly and targeting of channel complexes to the cell membrane and together with α1C or α1D increase DHP binding and enhance L-type channel function (19Williams M.E.

Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, ethanol-induced increases in abundance of α2 or β subunits might also increase the density of functional L-type channels in PC12 cells. To investigate which calcium channel subunits were increased by ethanol, we examined subunit immunoreactivity in membranes isolated from PC12 cells treated with 150 mm ethanol for 0–6 days. Ethanol evoked a time-dependent increase in α1C immunoreactivity, with levels peaking at 6 days of ethanol exposure (Fig. 1, A and B). Ethanol also increased levels of immunoreactivity for α2 and β1b without altering levels of immunoreactivity for β2 or β3 subunits (Fig. 1, A andC). Ethanol did not induce the appearance of α1D-like immunoreactivity (data not shown). These findings suggest that in PC12 cells, chronic ethanol exposure increases the abundance of L-type calcium channels composed of α1C, α2, and β1b subunits. To examine the role of PKCδ in calcium channel regulation, we used PC12 cell lines that stably express the fragment δV1, which is derived from the first variable domain of PKCδ and selectively inhibits phorbol ester-induced translocation of PKCδ (40Johnson J.A.

Mochly-Rosen D. Messing R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15028-15035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). No differences in basal levels of immunoreactivity for α1C, α2, and β1b were observed in PC12 cells, vector-transfected cells, or V1δ2 or V1δ3 cells that express δV1 (data not shown). Treatment with 150 mm ethanol for 6 days increased membrane-associated immunoreactivity for α1C, α2, and β1b by 60–75% in PC12 cells and vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2). However no increase was observed in V1δ2 or V1δ3 cells. These results suggest that although PKCδ does not regulate basal levels of α1C, α2, and β1b, it is required for ethanol-induced increases in these calcium channel subunits. Chronic exposure to ethanol alters the abundance of several proteins including tyrosine hydroxylase (42Gayer G.G. Gordon A. Miles M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22279-22284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) phosducin-like protein (43Miles M. Barhite S. Sganga M. Elliot M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10831-10835Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the molecular chaperones Hsc 70 (44Miles M.F. Diaz J.E. DeGuzman V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2409-2414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GRP 78 (45Miles M.F. Wilke N. Elliot M. Tanner W. Shah S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 873-879PubMed Google Scholar), and GRP 94 (45) by increasing gene expression. Ethanol-induced increases in L-type channels might also occur at a transcriptional level since PKCδ has been implicated in activation of AP1/Jun-regulated gene expression (46Hirai S. Izumi Y. Higa K. Kaibuchi K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2331-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 47Li W. Michieli P. Alimandi M. Lorenzi M.V. Wu Y. Wang L.-H. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 731-737PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility, we measured the abundance of calcium channel subunit mRNAs in PC12 cells after chronic ethanol exposure. Levels of total RNA per cell were not altered by exposure to 120 mm ethanol for 1–5 days (n = 7,p = 0.3754, ANOVA). Therefore we performed all mRNA studies using total RNA. Subsequent ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) analysis of GAPDH mRNA expression demonstrated that GAPDH mRNA levels were not altered by exposure to 120 mm ethanol for 1–5 days (n = 4, p = 0.8742, ANOVA). Therefore, we used GAPDH as an internal control to normalize all subsequent RPAs and slot blots for variation in sample loading. These studies revealed that ethanol did not increase levels of mRNA for α2δ or β1b (Fig.3). Two alternatively spliced variants of rat α1C have been identified as α1C-1 and α1C-2 (18Snutch T.P. Tomlinson W.J. Leonard J.P. M. G.M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 45-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The major sequence difference between these variants lies within the S3 segment of domain IV within a region that is 43% different at the nucleotide level (36 differences in 84 nucleotides). Therefore, to identify both splice variants simultaneously by RPA, we analyzed α1C mRNA using a riboprobe made from the domain IV S3 segment of α1C-2 that includes this region of mismatch at its 5′ end (Fig. 4 A). This riboprobe was predicted to protect a 498-bp fragment from α1C-2 mRNA. Mismatch within the 5′ tail of the riboprobe was predicted to yield a fragment that is 84 bp shorter (approximately 414 bp) when complexed with α1C-1mRNA. As expected, RPA analysis with this probe revealed two fragments, one approximately 500 bp and the other approximately 410 bp in size. Only the abundance of the shorter fragment was increased by chronic ethanol exposure (Fig. 4, B and C). Increases in this putative α1C-1 transcript were apparent within 1 day of ethanol exposure (p < 0.001, ANOVA, Newman Keuls) and persisted throughout the 6 days of treatment (p < 0.02, ANOVA, Newman Keuls). Upon removal of ethanol from the cultures, the abundance of this mRNA species declined rapidly, reaching base-line levels within 24 h. These findings suggest that chronic exposure to ethanol selectively increases the abundance of α1C-1 mRNA in PC12 cells. To ensure that increases in the 410-bp fragment observed with the α1C-2 probe represent increases in α1C-1mRNA, we repeated the RPA analysis with a probe made from α1C-1 cDNA. As predicted, this probe recognized a major fragment of approximately 582 bp, and exposure to 120 mm ethanol for 0–5 days increased its abundance (data not shown). The magnitude of this increase was similar to that observed for the 410-bp fragment detected with the α1C-2 probe. This finding confirms our results in Figs. 4 and5 suggesting that ethanol selectively increases levels of α1C-1 mRNA. If PKCδ mediates ethanol-induced increases in α1C-1 mRNA, then α1C-1 mRNA levels should not be altered in ethanol-treated cells that express δV1. To examine this possibility, we treated V1δ2 cells with 120 mm ethanol for 0–5 days and found that ethanol exposure produced a time-dependent increase in α1C-1 mRNA abundance (Fig. 5,A and B). This increase was also observed in a second δV1-expressing cell line V1δ3 (Fig. 5 C). In addition, increases in δV1-expresing cells were much greater than increases observed in PC12 or vector-transfected cells (Fig.5 C). Ethanol did not increase the abundance of α2δ or β1b mRNA in these δV1-expressing cells (Fig. 5, D and E). These results indicate that ethanol selectively increases α1C-1mRNA levels by a PKCδ-independent mechanism. Among the several calcium channel subunits that can contribute to the formation of L-type calcium channels, our clone of PC12 cells appears to express only α1C, α2, β1b, β2, and β3 subunits. In previous work we found that exposure of PC12 cells to 150 mm ethanol for 6 days increases DHP binding and the function of L-type calcium channels by 55–85% (28Gerstin Jr., E.H. McMahon T. Hundle B. Dadgar J. Messing R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16409-16414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the current study, we found that exposure to the same concentration of ethanol for the same amount of time increases membrane-associated immunoreactivity for α1C, α2, and β1b calcium channel subunits by 60–75% without altering immunoreactivity for β2 or β3 subunits. Increases in α1C immunoreactivity followed a time course similar to that observed previously for increases in K+-stimulated45Ca2+ uptake in PC12 cells (7Messing R.O. Carpenter C.L. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6213-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 28Gerstin Jr., E.H. McMahon T. Hundle B. Dadgar J. Messing R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16409-16414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Since the magnitudes of ethanol-induced increases in DHP binding, L-type channel function, and α1C, α2, and β1b subunit immunoreactivities are similar, ethanol-induced increases L-type calcium channels are most likely due to increases in these calcium channel subunits. Recently we found that increases in DHP binding and L-type channel function following chronic ethanol exposure are inhibited in cells that express the selective PKCδ inhibitor, δV1 (28Gerstin Jr., E.H. McMahon T. Hundle B. Dadgar J. Messing R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16409-16414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the current study, we found that ethanol-induced increases in α1C, α2, and β1b subunits are also completely blocked in δV1-expressing cells. Therefore, our present results are consistent with our previous findings and together indicate that PKCδ is required for ethanol-induced increases in the density of functional L-type channels in PC12 cells. Our finding that β1b, but not β2 or β3, was selectively increased by ethanol, suggests that ethanol, via PKCδ, specifically recruits β1b subunits to newly formed L-type channel complexes. Exposure to ethanol did not alter β1b mRNA, indicating that ethanol regulates the abundance of β1b by post-transcriptional mechanisms. β subunits contain consensus sites for PKC phosphorylation, and phosphorylation of β subunits by PKC has been proposed to regulate L-type channel function (48Castellano A. Wei X. Birnbaumer L. Perez-Reyes E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3450-3455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Bouron A. Soldatov N.M. Reuter H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Further studies will be required to determine whether PKCδ selectively phosphorylates and regulates β1b protein turnover or trafficking in ethanol-treated cells. Ethanol exposure also selectively increased mRNA for α1C-1 without altering levels of mRNA for the alternative splice variant, α1C-2, or for other channel subunits. This is the first report of ethanol regulating the abundance of a specific mRNA splice variant. The most striking difference between α1C-1 and α1C-2 is a 13-aa substitution within a 28-aa region corresponding to the S3 segment of transmembrane domain IV. Although most of the 13 substitutions within this region are conservative, one exception is the substitution of a proline in α1C-1 for an alanine in α1C-2 at the amino terminus of the S3 segment. Substitutions located within or near this region may regulate channel gating (50Bourinet E. Soong T.W. Sutton K. Slaymaker S. Mathews E. Monteil A. Zamponi G.W. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological studies with expressed α1C-1 and α1C-2subunits will be required to investigate this possibility. Increases in α1C-1 were also observed in δV1-expressing cells, suggesting that ethanol increases levels of α1C-1mRNA by PKCδ-independent mechanisms. Neither α2δ nor β1b mRNA abundance was altered by ethanol treatment in these cell lines, indicating that the response is specific for α1C-1. Increases in α1C-1 mRNA could be due to ethanol-induced changes in the splicing of α1C transcripts leading to greater production of α1C-1 mRNA. Alternatively, ethanol may act to decrease α1C-1 mRNA degradation. Why these effects of ethanol should be specific for α1C1 mRNA is unknown and requires further study. In the parent PC12 cell line, α1C-1 mRNA levels were increased after 1 day of ethanol exposure and remained nearly constant as long as ethanol was present. In contrast, in δV1-expressing cells, ethanol induced a much greater rise in α1C-1 mRNA, which continued to increase over the 5 days of ethanol exposure. These results suggest that PKCδ normally acts to limit α1C-1mRNA abundance, possibly by regulating α1C mRNA splicing or by promoting degradation of α1C-1 mRNA. This could be due to a direct effect of PKCδ on α1CmRNA processing or might occur indirectly, if PKCδ-mediated increases in calcium channel proteins evoke homeostatic mechanisms that decrease α1C-1 mRNA abundance. Additional splice variants of human α1C have been identified (51Perez-Reyes E. Wei X. Castellano A. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20430-20436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of exons 21 and 22 of the human α1C gene produces splice variants in the S2 segment of transmembrane domain III, and these show differences in the voltage sensitivity of inhibition by DHP antagonists (52Soldatov N.M. Bouron A. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10540-10543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing in the cytoplasmic tail alters the kinetics and the calcium dependence of channel inactivation (53Soldatov N.M. Zühlke R.D. Bouron A. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3560-3566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, alternative splicing of α1C transcripts can confer distinct functional characteristics to neuronal L-type channels. Ongoing studies will investigate whether similar splice variants can be identified in rat neural cells and whether ethanol regulates their abundance. Our results provide additional evidence for PKCδ as a regulator of L-type channel density and a mediator of cellular adaptation to ethanol. Our findings also indicate that PKCδ acts via post-transcriptional mechanisms to increase the density of L-type channels. In addition, our results provide evidence for a PKCδ-independent mechanism leading to increases in α1C-1 mRNA that may also contribute to ethanol-induced up-regulation of L-type channels. However, PKCδ-dependent mechanisms appear to be essential and rate-limiting for increases in L-type channels, since inhibition of PKCδ completely prevents ethanol-induced increases in DHP binding and L-type channel function (28Gerstin Jr., E.H. McMahon T. Hundle B. Dadgar J. Messing R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16409-16414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Since antagonists of L-type channels decrease alcohol self-administration (13Fadda F. Garau B. Colombo G. Gessa G.L. Alcohol. Clin. Exp.

https://openalex.org/W1495133552,"The retinoid receptors (RARs and RXRs) are mediators of the multiple effects of retinoic acid. Of these, the retinoic acid receptor beta2 (RARbeta2) has frequently been shown to be the principal mediator of the growth and tumor suppressive effects of retinoic acid; this gene is inactivated in many epithelial tumors and their derived cell lines. We have searched for genes that are regulated by this isoform and are potentially involved in tumor suppression. Using the Atlas human cDNA array I, we identified 27 genes (not counting RARbeta itself) that are regulated, directly or indirectly, by RARbeta2 when it is transfected into Calu-1, a lung tumor-derived line that does not normally express RARbeta. Several of the affected genes code for proteins whose functions would augment the process of apoptosis and/or the host's immune response. The latter group included ICAM-1 and MHC class I heavy chain, whose protein products play particularly important roles in the mounting of an effective anti-tumor response. We then confirmed by flow cytometry that the observed increases in message levels were reflected in increased cell surface protein levels for ICAM-1 and MHC class I in RARbeta2 transfectants of two RARbeta-deficient lines, Calu-1 and the epidermoid lung cancer-derived line SK-MES. Finally, we showed that RARbeta2 transfection of Calu-1 cells enhanced the heterologous CTL response in both the induction and the effector phases by up to threefold. These results support the hypothesis that down-regulation of these genes (and possibly others) in RARbeta-deficient tumor cells contributes to immune system evasion, and suggest a novel therapeutic approach for this disease."
https://openalex.org/W1516769894,"p202a is a murine protein that is induced during the fusion of myoblasts to myotubes and can also be induced by interferon. Even 2–3-fold overexpression of p202a in cells retards proliferation. p202a was shown to modulate transcription by binding, and inhibiting the activity of several transcription factors including c-Fos, c-Jun, AP-2, E2F1, E2F4, NF-κB, MyoD, and myogenin. Here we report that p202a also bound the c-Myc protein in vitro andin vivo; the C-terminal p202a b segment bound the C-terminal basic region helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHLZ) region of c-Myc. The transfection of a p202a expression plasmid inhibited the c-Myc-dependent expression of reporter plasmids in transient assays; moreover, overexpression of p202a in stable cell lines decreased the endogenous levels of mRNAs whose expression is driven by c-Myc. These effects of p202a are consistent with our finding that the binding of p202a to c-Myc inhibited the binding of c-Myc to Max in vitro and in vivo. p202a also inhibited the c-Myc-induced anchorage-independent growth and apoptosis of Rat-1 cells. The inhibition of c-Myc-dependent transcription, proliferation, and apoptosis by p202a is in line with the involvement of p202a in differentiation."
