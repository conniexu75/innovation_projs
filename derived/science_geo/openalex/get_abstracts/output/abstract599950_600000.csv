https://openalex.org/W2770340534,"The Pacific Equatorial dry forest of Northern Peru is recognised for its unique endemic biodiversity. Although highly threatened the forest provides livelihoods and ecosystem services to local communities. As agro-industrial expansion and climatic variation transform the region, close ecosystem monitoring is essential for viable adaptation strategies. UAVs offer an affordable alternative to satellites in obtaining both colour and near infrared imagery to meet the specific requirements of spatial and temporal resolution of a monitoring system. Combining this with their capacity to produce three dimensional models of the environment provides an invaluable tool for species level monitoring. Here we demonstrate that object-based image analysis of very high resolution UAV images can identify and quantify keystone tree species and their health across wide heterogeneous landscapes. The analysis exposes the state of the vegetation and serves as a baseline for monitoring and adaptive implementation of community based conservation and restoration in the area."
https://openalex.org/W2770361910,"The first year of university is a particularly stressful period and can impact academic performance and students' health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the health and lifestyle of undergraduates and assess risk factors associated with psychiatric symptoms.Between September 2012 and June 2013, we included all undergraduate students who underwent compulsory a medical visit at the university medical service in Nice (France) during which they were screened for potential diseases during a diagnostic interview. Data were collected prospectively in the CALCIUM database (Consultations Assistés par Logiciel pour les Centres Inter-Universitaire de Médecine) and included information about the students' lifestyle (living conditions, dietary behavior, physical activity, use of recreational drugs). The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms related to depression, anxiety and panic attacks was assessed and risk factors for these symptoms were analyzed using logistic regression.A total of 4,184 undergraduates were included. Prevalence for depression, anxiety and panic attacks were 12.6%, 7.6% and 1.0%, respectively. During the 30 days preceding the evaluation, 0.6% of the students regularly drank alcohol, 6.3% were frequent-to-heavy tobacco smokers, and 10.0% smoked marijuana. Dealing with financial difficulties and having learning disabilities were associated with psychiatric symptoms. Students who were dissatisfied with their living conditions and those with poor dietary behavior were at risk of depression. Being a woman and living alone were associated with anxiety. Students who screened positively for any psychiatric disorder assessed were at a higher risk of having another psychiatric disorder concomitantly.The prevalence of psychiatric disorders in undergraduate students is low but the rate of students at risk of developing chronic disease is far from being negligible. Understanding predictors for these symptoms may improve students' health by implementing targeted prevention campaigns. Further research in other French universities is necessary to confirm our results."
https://openalex.org/W2770056242,"Oral cancer is the most common type of cancer among men in India and other countries in South Asia. Late diagnosis contributes significantly to this mortality, highlighting the need for effective and specific point-of-care diagnostic tools. The same regions with high prevalence of oral cancer have seen extensive growth in mobile phone infrastructure, which enables widespread access to telemedicine services. In this work, we describe the evaluation of an automated tablet-based mobile microscope as an adjunct for telemedicine-based oral cancer screening in India. Brush biopsy, a minimally invasive sampling technique was combined with a simplified staining protocol and a tablet-based mobile microscope to facilitate local collection of digital images and remote evaluation of the images by clinicians. The tablet-based mobile microscope (CellScope device) combines an iPad Mini with collection optics, LED illumination and Bluetooth-controlled motors to scan a slide specimen and capture high-resolution images of stained brush biopsy samples. Researchers at the Mazumdar Shaw Medical Foundation (MSMF) in Bangalore, India used the instrument to collect and send randomly selected images of each slide for telepathology review. Evaluation of the concordance between gold standard histology, conventional microscopy cytology, and remote pathologist review of the images was performed as part of a pilot study of mobile microscopy as a screening tool for oral cancer. Results indicated that the instrument successfully collected images of sufficient quality to enable remote diagnoses that show concordance with existing techniques. Further studies will evaluate the effectiveness of oral cancer screening with mobile microscopy by minimally trained technicians in low-resource settings."
https://openalex.org/W2768851744,"Although Diabetes mellitus is a major public health problem in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region with high rates of diabetic foot complications, there are only limited data concerning mortality among such a high risk group. Therefore, the main aim of the current study was to assess all-cause mortality and its related predictors among diabetic patients with and without diabetic foot complications.Using data from the Saudi National Diabetes Registry (SNDR), a total of 840 patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes aged ≥25 years with current or past history of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) or diabetes related lower extremity amputation (LEA) were recruited in 2007 from active patients' files and followed up to 2013. These patients were compared with an equal number of age and gender matched diabetic patients without foot complication recruited at the same period. All patients were subjected to living status verification at 31st December 2013.The all-cause mortality rate among patients with DFU was 42.54 per 1000 person-years and among LEA patients was 86.80 per 1000 person-years among LEA patients for a total of 2280 and 1129 person-years of follow up respectively. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) (95% CI) was 4.39 (3.55-5.23) and 7.21 (5.70-8.72) for cases with foot ulcer and LEA respectively. The percentage of deceased patients increased by almost twofold (18.5%) among patients with diabetic foot ulcer and more than threefold (32.2%) among patients with LEA compared with patients without diabetic foot complications (10.7%). The worst survival was among patients with LEA at 0.679 and the presence of diabetic nephropathy was the only significant independent risk factor for all-cause mortality among patients with diabetic foot complications. On the other hand, obese patients have demonstrated significantly reduced all-cause mortality rate.Diabetic patients with diabetic foot complications have an excess mortality rate when compared with diabetic counterparts without foot complications and the general population. Early interventions to prevent foot ulceration and consequent LEA as well as all the measurements for reducing the prevalence of microvascular and macrovascular complications should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2769128314,"As an extension of the brain, the spinal cord has unique properties which could allow us to gain a better understanding of CNS pathology. The brain and cord share the same cellular components, yet the latter is simpler in cytoarchitecture and connectivity. In Alzheimer's research, virtually all focus is on brain pathology, however it has been shown that transgenic Alzheimer's mouse models accumulate beta amyloid plaques in spinal cord, suggesting that the cord possesses the same molecular machinery and conditions for plaque formation. Here we report a spatial-temporal map of plaque load in 5xFAD mouse spinal cord. We found that plaques started to appear at 11 weeks, then exhibited a time dependent increase and differential distribution along the cord. More plaques were found in cervical than other spinal levels at all time points examined. Despite heavy plaque load at 6 months, the number of cervical motor neurons in 5xFAD mice is comparable to wild type littermates. On detailed microscopic examination, fine beta amyloid-containing and beta sheet-rich thread-like structures were found in the peri-axonal space of many axons. Importantly, these novel structures appear before any plaque deposits are visible in young mice spinal cord and they co-localize with axonal swellings at later stages, suggesting that these thread-like structures might represent the initial stages of plaque formation, and could play a role in axonal damage. Additionally, we were able to demonstrate increasing myelinopathy in aged 5xFAD mouse spinal cord using the lipid probe Nile Red with high resolution. Collectively, we found significant amyloid pathology in grey and white matter of the 5xFAD mouse spinal cord which indicates that this structure maybe a useful platform to study mechanisms of Alzheimer's pathology and disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2768331575,"Since 2013 in Emilia-Romagna, Italy, surveillance information generated in the public health and in the animal health sectors has been shared and used to guide public health interventions to mitigate the risk of West Nile virus (WNV) transmission via blood transfusion. The objective of the current study was to identify and estimate the costs and benefits associated with this One Health surveillance approach, and to compare it to an approach that does not integrate animal health information in blood donations safety policy (uni-sectoral scenario). Costs of human, animal, and entomological surveillance, sharing of information, and triggered interventions were estimated. Benefits were quantified as the averted costs of potential human cases of WNV neuroinvasive disease associated to infected blood transfusion. In the 2009–2015 period, the One Health approach was estimated to represent a cost saving of €160,921 compared to the uni-sectoral scenario. Blood donation screening was the main cost for both scenarios. The One Health approach further allowed savings of €1.21 million in terms of avoided tests on blood units. Benefits of the One Health approach due to short-term costs of hospitalization and compensation for transfusion-associated disease potentially avoided, were estimated to range from €0 to €2.98 million according to the probability of developing WNV neuroinvasive disease after receiving an infected blood transfusion."
https://openalex.org/W2769803536,"Background Sepsis-induced neuroinflammation plays an important role in sepsis-related brain dysfunction. However, the molecules that are targeted during neuroinflammation resulting from sepsis-induced brain dysfunction remain unclear. Herein, we tried to investigate the expression and roles of NMDA receptor subunits during sepsis-related brain dysfunction. Methods Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) or by a single intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 8 mg/kg) in C57BL/6J mice. The NMDA receptor co-agonist D-serine was injected intraperitoneally for 3 days (500 mg/kg/day) to compensate for the loss of NMDA receptors. The behaviors of mice were tested in the Barnes maze and in the open field test. The mice were euthanized at the indicated time points. The brains were collected to detect the following: the levels of synaptophysin and NMDA receptor subunits GluN2A, GluN2B and GluN1 (by Western blot and RT-PCR); the number of CA1 neurons (by Nissl staining); neuronal activity (by p-CREB staining); neuroinflammation (by staining of Iba-1 and inflammatory factors IL-1β, TNF-α, NLRP3); and the levels of oxidative stress [by dihydroethidium (DHE)]. Results Sepsis selectively decreased the protein and mRNA levels of GluN2A, GluN2B and GluN1 but not the levels of synaptophysin or the neuronal number in the hippocampus of mice in either of the classic CLP-induced or LPS-induced sepsis models during the first 7 days after sepsis. Intraperitoneal injection of D-serine obviously limited the lipopolysaccharide-induced changes, including the impairment of learning and memory, the loss of NMDA receptor subunits, robust neuroinflammation, the levels of ROS stress and the decrease of p-CREB in the hippocampus of mice. Conclusion These data suggest that the sepsis-induced selective loss of NMDA receptors modulates hippocampal neuropathology in the mice that survived sepsis, and the data show that NMDA receptors are potential targets for the improvement of brain dysfunction in sepsis survivors."
https://openalex.org/W2769945558,"Prenatal sex hormones exert organizational effects. It has been suggested that prenatal sex hormones affect adult morphological parameters, such as the finger length. Especially the second-to-fourth finger length (2D:4D) ratio has been implicated to be modified when exposed to higher androgen levels in utero. Here we show in a mouse model that experimental manipulation of the prenatal androgen level, by blocking the androgen receptor with flutamide or activating the androgen receptor with dihydrotestosterone (DHT), leads to changes in the length of the fingers of all paws in males and females. In addition to that, also total paw length and the 2D:4D ratio was affected. In males treated with DHT, the 2D:4D ratio was increased, while flutamide-treatment in females led to a reduced 2D:4D ratio. We also measured other parameters, such as head size, body length and tail length and demonstrate that body morphology is affected by prenatal androgen exposure with more prominent effects in females. Another factor that is thought to be influenced by early androgens is handedness. We tested mice for handedness, but did not find a significant effect of the prenatal treatment. These findings demonstrate that prenatal androgen activity is involved in the development of body morphology and might be a useful marker for prenatal androgen exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2768546014,"Quercetin is a polyphenol found in food that has numerous health benefits. This study investigated the relationship between quercetin metabolism, gut microbiota composition, and dietary intake in elderly Japanese subjects. A food frequency questionnaire was used to assess dietary intake during the week prior to stool sample collection. Fecal suspensions from 56 subjects were anaerobically incubated with quercetin and fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by next-generation sequencing. Inter-individual variations in quercetin concentration and fecal microbiota composition at family level suggested differences in microbial quercetin metabolism. The abundance of Sutterellaceae (r = -0.292) and Oscillospiraceae (r = -0.334) was negatively correlated whereas that of Fusobacteriaceae (r = 0.361) and Enterobacteriaceae (r = 0.321) was positively correlated with quercetin concentration. Niacin (r = -0.313), vitamin B6 (r = -0.297), vitamin B12 (r = -0.266), vitamin D (r = -0.301), and ratio of animal protein to total protein (r = -0.27) were also negatively correlated with quercetin concentration. Bacterial abundance was positively or negatively related to intake of food components. This is the first report describing the relationship between fecal quercetin metabolism, human microbiota, and dietary intake in the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W2769135167,"The present study aimed to evaluate the functional connectivity (FC) in relevant cortex areas during simulated driving with distraction based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) method. Twelve subjects were recruited to perform three types of driving tasks, namely, straight driving, straight driving with secondary auditory task, and straight driving with secondary visual vigilance task, on a driving simulator. The wavelet amplitude (WA) and wavelet phase coherence (WPCO) of the fNIRS signals were calculated in six frequency intervals: I, 0.6–2 Hz; II, 0.145–0.6 Hz; III, 0.052–0.145 Hz; IV, 0.021–0.052 Hz; and V, 0.0095–0.021 Hz, VI, 0.005–0.0095Hz. Results showed that secondary tasks during driving led to worse driving performance, brain activity changes, and dynamic configuration of the connectivity. The significantly lower WA value in the right motor cortex in interval IV, and higher WPCO values in intervals II, V, and VI were found with additional auditory task. Significant standard deviation of speed and lower WA values in the left prefrontal cortex and right prefrontal cortex in interval VI, and lower WPCO values in intervals I, IV, V, and VI were found under the additional visual vigilance task. The results suggest that the changed FC levels in intervals IV, V, and VI were more likely to reflect the driver’s distraction condition. The present study provides new insights into the relationship between distracted driving behavior and brain activity. The method may be used for the evaluation of drivers’ attention level."
https://openalex.org/W2770701436,"Over the past decades, a number of national policies and international conventions have been implemented to promote the expansion of the world's protected area network, leading to a diversification of protected area strategies, types and designations. As a result, many areas are protected by more than one convention, legal instrument, or other effective means which may result in a lack of clarity around the governance and management regimes of particular locations. We assess the degree to which different designations overlap at global, regional and national levels to understand the extent of this phenomenon at different scales. We then compare the distribution and coverage of these multi-designated areas in the terrestrial and marine realms at the global level and among different regions, and we present the percentage of each county's protected area extent that is under more than one designation. Our findings show that almost a quarter of the world's protected area network is protected through more than one designation. In fact, we have documented up to eight overlapping designations. These overlaps in protected area designations occur in every region of the world, both in the terrestrial and marine realms, but are more common in the terrestrial realm and in some regions, notably Europe. In the terrestrial realm, the most common overlap is between one national and one international designation. In the marine realm, the most common overlap is between any two national designations. Multi-designations are therefore a widespread phenomenon but its implications are not well understood. This analysis identifies, for the first time, multi-designated areas across all designation types. This is a key step to understand how these areas are managed and governed to then move towards integrated and collaborative approaches that consider the different management and conservation objectives of each designation."
https://openalex.org/W2769135276,"Current cold storage organ preservation technique fails to preserve marginal donor grafts sufficiently. Evidence from large animal experiments suggests superiority of normothermic machine preservation of liver allografts. Long-term organ preservation using normothermic perfusion might not only allow organ viability assessment before transplantation, but also provide the means for further organ modifications under physiologic conditions. Previous research has shown that porcine livers can be transplanted successfully after normothermic preservation of 20 hours. In the present study we investigate whether similar methodology is capable of further extending the safe limit to 48 hours. In this study, livers from White Landrace pigs were preserved by normothermic, oxygenated sanguineous perfusion. After a 48-hour period of preservation, livers were transplanted into recipient pigs and followed for 5 days. Outcome parameters measured included markers of synthetic and metabolic liver function as well as hepatocellular injury and blood gas analysis during perfusion and follow-up. Histological assessment of morphological liver integrity was performed. All livers showed sustained bile production and metabolic activity throughout the preservation period. Low levels of hepatocellular damage were found. Following transplantation all liver grafts revealed excellent graft function and death-censored graft survival was 100%. Porcine livers were transplanted successfully following 48 hours normothermic machine preservation."
https://openalex.org/W2769301052,"Commuters who spend long hours on roads are exposed to high levels of traffic related air pollutants (TRAPs). Despite some well-known multiple adverse effects of TRAPs on human health, limited studies have focused on mitigation strategies to reduce these effects. In this study, we measured fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ultrafine particle (UFP) concentrations inside and outside 17 taxis simultaneously while they were driven on roadways. The drivers’ urinary monohydroxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OH-PAHs) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations just before and right after the driving tests were also determined. Data were collected under three driving conditions (i.e. no mitigation (NM), window closed (WC), and window closed plus using high efficiency cabin air filters (WC+HECA)) for each taxi and driver. The results show that, compared to NM, the WC+HECA reduced in-cabin PM2.5 and UFP concentrations, by 37% and 47% respectively (p < 0.05), whereas the reductions on PAH exposures were insignificant. Although nonsignificant, a reduction of 17% was also observed in the drivers’ urinary MDA under WC+HECA. The MDA concentrations were found to be significantly associated with the in-cabin PM2.5 and UFP concentrations, suggesting the reduction of the drivers’ lipid peroxidation can be at least partially attributed to the PM2.5 and UFP reduction by WC+HECA. Overall, these results suggest HECA filters have potential to reduce particle levels inside taxis and protect drivers’ health."
https://openalex.org/W2768101470,"Wnt3a is a major regulator of bone metabolism however, very few of its target genes are known in bone. Wnt3a preferentially signals through transmembrane receptors Frizzled and co-receptors Lrp5/6 to activate the canonical signaling pathway. Previous studies have shown that the canonical Wnt co-receptors Lrp5 and Lrp6 also play an essential role in normal postnatal bone homeostasis, yet, very little is known about specific contributions by these co-receptors in Wnt3a-dependent signaling. We used high-throughput sequencing technology to identify target genes regulated by Wnt3a in osteoblasts and to elucidate the role of Lrp5 and Lrp6 in mediating Wnt3a signaling. Our study identified 782 genes regulated by Wnt3a in primary calvarial osteoblasts. Wnt3a up-regulated the expression of several key regulators of osteoblast proliferation/ early stages of differentiation while inhibiting genes expressed in later stages of osteoblastogenesis. We also found that Lrp6 is the key mediator of Wnt3a signaling in osteoblasts and Lrp5 played a less significant role in mediating Wnt3a signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2768849251,"As the outermost physical barrier of an organism, the skin is diurnally exposed to UV radiation (UVR). Recent studies have revealed that the skin exhibits a circadian rhythm in various functions, and this oscillation is disturbed and reset via a strong environmental cue, the UVR. However, a molecular link between circadian perturbation by UVR and UVR-induced cellular responses has not been investigated. We identified tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase ( TIMP)- 3 as a novel circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK)-dependent diurnal gene by using a CLOCK-knockdown strategy in human keratinocytes. Among dozens of identified transcripts down-regulated by CLOCK knockdown, TIMP3 displayed a rhythmic expression in a CLOCK-dependent manner, in which the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL)-1, and IL-8, were inversely regulated. Upon UVB exposure, the expression of CLOCK and TIMP3 was down-regulated, which led to an up-regulation of secretion of MMP1 and TNF-α proteins and in the transcription of CXCL1 and IL-8 via CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)-α. UVB-induced TNF-α secretion increased further or decreased by knockdown or overexpression of TIMP3, respectively, as well as by CLOCK. As a novel CLOCK-dependent diurnal gene, TIMP3 inhibits the expression of inflammatory cytokines that are up-regulated by UV irradiation in human keratinocytes. Thus, our work suggests a molecular link between circadian perturbation by UVR and UVR-induced inflammation.-Park, S., Kim, K., Bae, I.-H., Lee, S. H., Jung, J., Lee, T. R., Cho, E.-G. TIMP3 is a CLOCK-dependent diurnal gene that inhibits the expression of UVB-induced inflammatory cytokines in human keratinocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2770214810,"It is difficult to know whether different dimensions of trust have different effects on local residents' acceptance of nuclear power plants (NPPs). In previous research such trust has been considered as a single dimensional concept. This paper divides trust into goodwill trust and competence trust, and we explore the ways in which trust affects acceptance of NPPs through structural equation modeling. A survey of 491 people was conducted in Haiyan County, China, where the Qinshan nuclear power plant is located. We find that goodwill trust is significantly correlated with competence trust, and each can indirectly promote residents' acceptance of NPPs but by different paths. Goodwill trust improves acceptance of NPPs by decreasing risk perception, while competence trust improves acceptance of NPPs by increasing benefit perception. However, the associations between goodwill trust and benefit perception, competence trust and risk perception, are not significant."
https://openalex.org/W2768399700,"Real-Time PCR (qPCR) testing is recommended as both a diagnostic and outcome measurement of etiological treatment in clinical practice and clinical trials of Chagas disease (CD), but no external quality assurance (EQA) program provides performance assessment of the assays in use. We implemented an EQA system to evaluate the performance of molecular biology laboratories involved in qPCR based follow-up in clinical trials of CD. An EQA program was devised for three clinical trials of CD: the E1224 (NCT01489228), a pro-drug of ravuconazole; the Sampling Study (NCT01678599), that used benznidazole, both conducted in Bolivia; and the CHAGASAZOL (NCT01162967), that tested posaconazole, conducted in Spain. Four proficiency testing panels containing negative controls and seronegative blood samples spiked with 1, 10 and 100 parasite equivalents (par. eq.)/mL of four Trypanosoma cruzi stocks, were sent from the Core Lab in Argentina to the participating laboratories located in Bolivia and Spain. Panels were analyzed simultaneously, blinded to sample allocation, at 4-month intervals. In addition, 302 random blood samples from both trials carried out in Bolivia were sent to Core Lab for retesting analysis. The analysis of proficiency testing panels gave 100% of accordance (within laboratory agreement) and concordance (between laboratory agreement) for all T. cruzi stocks at 100 par. eq./mL; whereas their values ranged from 71 to 100% and from 62 to 100% at 1 and 10 par. eq./mL, respectively, depending on the T. cruzi stock. The results obtained after twelve months of preparation confirmed the stability of blood samples in guanidine-EDTA buffer. No significant differences were found between qPCR results from Bolivian laboratory and Core Lab for retested clinical samples. This EQA program for qPCR analysis of CD patient samples may significantly contribute to ensuring the quality of laboratory data generated in clinical trials and molecular diagnostics laboratories of CD."
https://openalex.org/W2768413693,"Background The association of left ventricular remodeling (LVR) after myocardial infarction (MI) with the subsequent risk of heart failure (HF) and death has not been studied in patients receiving optimal secondary prevention. Methods and results We performed a long-term clinical follow-up of patients included in 2 prospective multicentric studies on LVR after first anterior MI. At 1-year echocardiography, LVR (≥20% increase in end-diastolic volume from baseline to 1 year) occurred in 67/215 (31%) patients in cohort 1 and in 87/226 (38%) patients in cohort 2. The prescription rate of secondary prevention medications was very high (ß-blockers at 1 year: 90% and 95% for cohorts 1 and 2, respectively; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACE-I/ARB) at 1 year: 93% and 97% for cohorts 1 and 2, respectively). Median clinical follow-up after LVR assessment was 11.0 years in cohort 1 and 7.8 years in cohort 2. In both cohorts, LVR patients had a progressive increase in the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF (p = 0.0007 in cohort 1 and 0.009 in cohort 2) with unadjusted hazard ratios of 2.52 [1.45–4.36] and 2.52 [1.23–5.17], respectively. Similar results were obtained when cardiovascular death was considered as an isolated endpoint. After adjustement on baseline characteristics including ejection fraction, the association with the composite endpoint was unchanged. Conclusion In a context of a modern therapeutic management with a large prescription of evidence-based medications, LVR remains independently associated with HF and cardiovascular death at long-term follow-up after MI."
https://openalex.org/W2770149636,"Phytoene desaturase (PDS) is an essential plant carotenoid biosynthetic enzyme and a prominent target of certain inhibitors, such as norflurazon, acting as bleaching herbicides. PDS catalyzes the introduction of two double bonds into 15-cis-phytoene, yielding 9,15,9'-tri-cis-ζ-carotene via the intermediate 9,15-di-cis-phytofluene. We present the necessary data to scrutinize functional implications inferred from the recently resolved crystal structure of Oryza sativa PDS in a complex with norflurazon. Using dynamic mathematical modeling of reaction time courses, we support the relevance of homotetrameric assembly of the enzyme observed in crystallo by providing evidence for substrate channeling of the intermediate phytofluene between individual subunits at membrane surfaces. Kinetic investigations are compatible with an ordered ping-pong bi-bi kinetic mechanism in which the carotene and the quinone electron acceptor successively occupy the same catalytic site. The mutagenesis of a conserved arginine that forms a hydrogen bond with norflurazon, the latter competing with plastoquinone, corroborates the possibility of engineering herbicide resistance, however, at the expense of diminished catalytic activity. This mutagenesis also supports a ""flavin only"" mechanism of carotene desaturation not requiring charged residues in the active site. Evidence for the role of the central 15-cis double bond of phytoene in determining regio-specificity of carotene desaturation is presented."
https://openalex.org/W2769702836,"Recombination is crucial for genetic evolution, which not only provides new allele combinations but also influences the biological evolution and efficacy of natural selection. However, recombination variation is not well understood outside of the complex species’ genomes, and it is particularly unclear in Gossypium. Cotton is the most important natural fibre crop and the second largest oil-seed crop. Here, we found that the genetic and physical maps distances did not have a simple linear relationship. Recombination rates were unevenly distributed throughout the cotton genome, which showed marked changes along the chromosome lengths and recombination was completely suppressed in the centromeric regions. Recombination rates significantly varied between A-subgenome (At) (range = 1.60 to 3.26 centimorgan/megabase [cM/Mb]) and D-subgenome (Dt) (range = 2.17 to 4.97 cM/Mb), which explained why the genetic maps of At and Dt are similar but the physical map of Dt is only half that of At. The translocation regions between A02 and A03 and between A04 and A05, and the inversion regions on A10, D10, A07 and D07 indicated relatively high recombination rates in the distal regions of the chromosomes. Recombination rates were positively correlated with the densities of genes, markers and the distance from the centromere, and negatively correlated with transposable elements (TEs). The gene ontology (GO) categories showed that genes in high recombination regions may tend to response to environmental stimuli, and genes in low recombination regions are related to mitosis and meiosis, which suggested that they may provide the primary driving force in adaptive evolution and assure the stability of basic cell cycle in a rapidly changing environment. Global knowledge of recombination rates will facilitate genetics and breeding in cotton."
https://openalex.org/W2770379048,"Ascorbic acid is a ubiquitous water soluble antioxidant that plays a critical role in plant growth and environmental stress tolerance. It acts as a free radical scavenger as well as a source of reducing power for several cellular processes. Because of its pivotal role in regulating plant growth under optimal as well as sub-optimal conditions, it becomes obligatory for plants to maintain a pool of reduced ascorbic acid. Several cellular processes help in maintaining the reduced ascorbic acid pool, by regulating its synthesis and regeneration processes. Current study demonstrates that monodehydroascorbate reductase is an important enzyme responsible for maintaining the reduced ascorbate pool, by optimizing the recycling of oxidized ascorbate. Cloning and functional characterization of this important stress inducible gene is of great significance for its imperative use in plant stress management. Therefore, we have cloned and functionally validated the role of monodehydroascorbate reductase gene (mdar) from a drought tolerant variety of Eleusine coracana. The cloned Ecmdar gene comprises of 1437bp CDS, encoding a 478 amino acid long polypeptide. The active site analysis showed presence of conserved Tyr348 residue, facilitating the catalytic activity in electron transfer mechanism. qPCR expression profiling of Ecmdar under stress indicated that it is an early responsive gene. The analysis of Ecmdar overexpressing Arabidopsis transgenic lines suggests that monodehydroascorbate reductase acts as a key stress regulator by modulating the activity of antioxidant enzymes to strengthen the ROS scavenging ability and maintains ROS homeostasis. Thus, it is evident that Ecmdar is an important gene for cellular homeostasis and its over-expression could be successfully used to strengthen stress tolerance in crop plants."
https://openalex.org/W2770344912,"The purposes of this study were to assess the usefulness of myocardial 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) for evaluating myocardial metabolic status in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and the therapeutic efficacy of alcohol septal ablation (ASA) in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).Thirty HCM patients (64.4±10.5 years, 14 male, 12 hypertrophic non-obstructive cardiomyopathy [HNCM], 16 HOCM, and 2 dilated phase of HCM) underwent 18F-FDG-PET/CT. 18F-FDG uptake was semi-quantitatively evaluated using an uptake score in each 17 segment and the entire LV or regional standardized uptake value (SUV).18F-FDG uptake was observed mostly in a hypertrophied myocardium in HNCM patients, whereas 18F-FDG was extensively accumulated beyond the hypertrophied myocardium in HOCM patients. There was a positive correlation between the summed uptake score of 18F-FDG and high-sensitive troponin T level in HNCM patients (r = 0.603, p = 0.049), whereas the score was positively correlated with brain natriuretic peptide level (r = 0.614, p = 0.011) in HOCM patients. In 10 patients who received ASA, the maximum SUV of the entire LV was significantly reduced from 5.6±2.6 to 3.2±2.1 (p = 0.040) after ASA. Reduction of that maximum SUV was particularly significant in the lateral region (from 5.5±2.6 to 2.9 ±2.2, p = 0.024) but not significant in the anteroseptal region (from 4.5±2.6 to 2.9±1.6, p = 0.12).Extensive 18F-FDG uptake beyond the hypertrophied myocardium was observed in HOCM. ASA attenuates 18F-FDG uptake in a remote lateral myocardium."
https://openalex.org/W2770969533,"Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) is an intra-cellular antioxidant enzyme found also in the circulation associated with high-density lipoproteins. The activity of this enzyme has been shown to be decreased in breast cancer (BC) patients. The aims of our study were to investigate the changes produced by radiotherapy (RT) on activity and concentration of serum PON1 in BC patients, and to evaluate the observed variations in relation to clinical and pathological characteristics of patients and tumors, and the response to treatment. We studied 200 women with BC who were scheduled to receive RT following excision of the tumor. Blood for analyses was obtained before and after the irradiation procedure. The control group was composed of 200 healthy women. Relative to control, BC patients had significantly lower serum PON1 activities pre-RT, while PON1 concentrations were at similar levels. RT was associated with a significant increase in serum PON1 activities and concentrations. We observed significant differences in serum PON1 concentrations post-RT between patients with luminal A or luminal B tumors. Serum PON1 concentration post-RT was markedly lower in BC patients with metastases. We conclude that benefit from RT accrues to the BC patients not only through its direct effect on cancer cells but also indirectly by improving the organism's anti-oxidant defense mechanisms. In addition, our preliminary evidence suggests that the measurement of serum PON1 concentration post-RT could be an efficient prognostic biomarker, and may be used as an index of the efficacy of the RT."
https://openalex.org/W2768820971,"Objective Factors that contribute to wealth related inequalities in self-rated health (SRH) and happiness remains unclear most especially in sub-Saharan countries (SSA). This study aims to explore and compare socioeconomic differentials in SRH and happiness in five SSA countries. Methods Using the 2010/2014 World Values Survey (WVS), we obtained a sample of 9,869 participants of age 16 and above from five SSA countries (Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Rwanda and Zimbabwe). Socioeconomic inequalities were quantified using the concentration index. The contribution of each predictor to concentration index’s magnitude was obtained by means of regression based decomposition analysis. Results Poor SRH ranges from approximately 9% in Nigeria to 20% in Zimbabwe, whereas unhappiness was lower in Rwanda (9.5%) and higher in South Africa (23.3%). Concentration index was negative for both outcomes in all countries, which implies that poor SRH and unhappiness are excessively concentrated among the poorest socioeconomic strata. Although magnitudes differ across countries, however, the major contributor to wealth-related inequality in poor SRH is satisfaction with financial situation whereas for unhappiness the major contributors are level of income and satisfaction with financial situation. Conclusions This study underscores an association between wealth related inequalities and poor SRH and unhappiness in the context of SSA. Improving equity in health, as suggested by the commission of social determinants of health may be useful in fighting against the unfair distribution of resources. Thus, knowledge about the self-rating of health and happiness can serve as proxy estimates for understanding the distribution of health care access and economic resources needed for well-being in resident countries."
https://openalex.org/W2769909110,"With increasing age cognitive performance slows down. This includes cognitive processes essential for motor performance. Additionally, performance of motor tasks becomes less accurate. The objective of the present study was to identify general neural correlates underlying age-related behavioral slowing and the reduction in motor task accuracy. To this end, we continuously recorded EEG activity from 18 younger and 24 older right-handed healthy participants while they were performing a simple finger tapping task. We analyzed the EEG records with respect to local changes in amplitude (power spectrum) as well as phase locking between the two age groups. We found differences between younger and older subjects in the amplitude of post-movement synchronization in the β band of the sensory-motor and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). This post-movement β amplitude was significantly reduced in older subjects. Moreover, it positively correlated with the accuracy with which subjects performed the motor task at the electrode FCz, which detects activity of the mPFC and the supplementary motor area. In contrast, we found no correlation between the accurate timing of local neural activity, i.e. phase locking in the δ-θ frequency band, with the reaction and movement time or the accuracy with which the motor task was performed. Our results show that only post-movement β amplitude and not δ-θ phase locking is involved in the control of movement accuracy. The decreased post-movement β amplitude in the mPFC of older subjects hints at an impaired deactivation of this area, which may affect the cognitive control of stimulus-induced motor tasks and thereby motor output."
https://openalex.org/W2768629431,"Psychiatric disorders are associated with aberrant brain development and/or aggressive behavior and are influenced by genetic factors; however, genes that affect brain aggression circuits remain elusive. Here, we show that neuronal Src-homology-2 (SH2)B adaptor protein-1 (Sh2b1) is indispensable for both brain growth and protection against aggression. Global and brain-specific deletion of Sh2b1 decreased brain weight and increased aggressive behavior. Global and brain-specific Sh2b1 knockout (KO) mice exhibited fatal, intermale aggression. In a resident-intruder paradigm, latency to attack was markedly reduced, whereas the number and the duration of attacks was significantly increased in global and brain-specific Sh2b1 KO mice compared with wild-type littermates. Consistently, core aggression circuits were activated to a higher level in global and brain-specific Sh2b1 KO males, based on c-fos immunoreactivity in the amygdala and periaqueductal gray. Brain-specific restoration of Sh2b1 normalized brain size and reversed pathologic aggression and aberrant activation of core aggression circuits in Sh2b1 KO males. SH2B1 mutations in humans were linked to aberrant brain development and behavior. At the molecular level, Sh2b1 enhanced neurotrophin-stimulated neuronal differentiation and protected against oxidative stress–induced neuronal death. Our data suggest that neuronal Sh2b1 promotes brain development and the integrity of core aggression circuits, likely through enhancing neurotrophin signaling.— Jiang, L., Su, H., Keogh, J.

https://openalex.org/W2770922837,"The structural effect of neurturin (NRTN) on the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in animals remains unknown, although NRTN has been shown to be effective in Parkinson’s disease animal models. Herein, we aimed to demonstrate that NRTN overexpression in dopaminergic neurons stimulates both neurite outgrowths in the nigrostriatal pathway and striatal dendritic spines in aging rats with chronic 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion. At week 12 after lesion, pTracer-mNRTN-His or pGreenLantern-1 plasmids were intranigrally transfected using the NTS-polyplex nanoparticles system. We showed that the transgenic expression in dopaminergic neurons remained until the end of the study (12 weeks). Only animals expressing NRTN-His showed recovery of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+ cells (28 ± 2%), their neurites (32 ± 2%) and the neuron-specific cytoskeletal marker β-III-tubulin in the substantia nigra; striatal TH(+) fibers were also recovered (52 ± 3%), when compared to the healthy condition. Neurotensin receptor type 1 levels were also significantly recovered in the substantia nigra and striatum. Dopamine recovery was 70 ± 4% in the striatum and complete in the substantia nigra. The number of dendritic spines of striatal medium spiny neurons was also significantly increased, but the recovery was not complete. Drug-activated circling behavior decreased by 73 ± 2% (methamphetamine) and 89 ± 1% (apomorphine). Similar decrease was observed in the spontaneous motor behavior. Our results demonstrate that NRTN causes presynaptic and postsynaptic restoration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system after a 6-OHDA-induced chronic lesion. However, those improvements did not reach the healthy condition, suggesting that NRTN exerts lesser neurotrophic effects than other neurotrophic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2770569633,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is the most common anxiety disorder and has considerable negative impact on social functioning, quality of life, and career progression of those affected. Gelotophobia (the fear of being laughed at) shares many similarities and has therefore been proposed as a subtype of SAD. This hypothesis has, however, never been tested in a clinical sample. Thus, the relationship between gelotophobia, SAD and avoidant personality disorder (APD) was investigated by examining a sample of 133 participants (64 psychiatric patients and 69 healthy controls matched for age and sex) using the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edition) and an established rating instrument for gelotophobia (GELOPH<15>). As expected, gelotophobia scores and the number of gelotophobic individuals were significantly higher among patients with SAD (n = 22) and APD (n = 12) compared to healthy controls and other psychiatric patients. Furthermore, gelotophobia scores were highest in patients suffering from both SAD and APD. In fact, all patients suffering from both disorders were also suffering from gelotophobia. As explained in the discussion, the observed data did not suggest that gelotophobia is a subtype of SAD. The findings rather imply that the fear of being laughed at is a symptom characteristic for both SAD and APD. Based on that, gelotophobia may prove to be a valuable additional diagnostic criterion for SAD and APD and the present results also contribute to the ongoing debate on the relationship between SAD and APD."
https://openalex.org/W2768332672,"In many contexts, nutrient excretion by consumers can impact ecosystems by altering the availability of limiting nutrients. Variation in nutrient excretion can be predicted by mass balance models, most of which are premised on two key ideas: (1) consumers maintain fixed whole-body nutrient content (i.e., %N and %P), so-called fixed homeostasis; (2) if dietary nutrients are not matched to whole-body nutrients, excesses of any nutrient are released as excretion to maintain fixed homeostasis. Mass balance models thus predict that consumer excretion should be positively correlated with diet nutrients and negatively correlated with whole-body nutrients. Recent meta-analyses and field studies, however, have often failed to find these expected patterns, potentially because of a confounding influence-flexibility in whole-body nutrient content with diet quality (flexible homeostasis). Here, we explore the impact of flexible homeostasis on nutrient excretion by comparing the N and P excretion of four genetically diverged Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata) populations when reared on diets of variable P content. As predicted by mass balance, P excretion increased on the high-P diet, but, contrary to the notion of fixed homeostasis, guppy whole-body %P also increased on the high-P diet. While there was no overall correlation between excretion nutrients and whole-body nutrients, when the effect of diet on both whole-body and excretion nutrients was included, we detected the expected negative correlation between whole-body N:P and excretion N:P. This last result suggests that mass balance can predict excretion rates within species, but only if dietary effects on whole-body nutrient content are controlled. Flexible homeostasis can obscure patterns predicted by mass balance, creating an imperative to accurately capture an organism's diet quality in predicting its excretion rate."
https://openalex.org/W2770910923,"Retinal ischemia induces apoptosis leading to neurodegeneration and vision impairment. Carbon monoxide (CO) in gaseous form showed cell-protective and anti-inflammatory effects after retinal ischemia-reperfusion-injury (IRI). These effects were also demonstrated for the intravenously administered CO-releasing molecule (CORM) ALF-186. This article summarizes the results of intravitreally released CO to assess its suitability as a neuroprotective and neuroregenerative agent.Water-soluble CORM ALF-186 (25 μg), PBS, or inactivated ALF (iALF) (all 5 μl) were intravitreally applied into the left eyes of rats directly after retinal IRI for 1 h. Their right eyes remained unaffected and were used for comparison. Retinal tissue was harvested 24 h after intervention to analyze mRNA or protein expression of Caspase-3, pERK1/2, p38, HSP70/90, NF-kappaB, AIF-1 (allograft inflammatory factor), TNF-α, and GAP-43. Densities of fluorogold-prelabeled retinal ganglion cells (RGC) were examined in flat-mounted retinae seven days after IRI and were expressed as mean/mm2. The ability of RGC to regenerate their axon was evaluated two and seven days after IRI using retinal explants in laminin-1-coated cultures. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze the different cell types growing out of the retinal explants.Compared to the RGC-density in the contralateral right eyes (2804±214 RGC/mm2; data are mean±SD), IRI+PBS injection resulted in a remarkable loss of RGC (1554±159 RGC/mm2), p<0.001. Intravitreally injected ALF-186 immediately after IRI provided RGC protection and reduced the extent of RGC-damage (IRI+PBS 1554±159 vs. IRI+ALF 2179±286, p<0.001). ALF-186 increased the IRI-mediated phosphorylation of MAP-kinase p38. Anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects were detectable as Caspase-3, NF-kappaB, TNF-α, and AIF-1 expression were significantly reduced after IRI+ALF in comparison to IRI+PBS or IRI+iALF. Gap-43 expression was significantly increased after IRI+ALF. iALF showed effects similar to PBS. The intrinsic regenerative potential of RGC-axons was induced to nearly identical levels after IRI and ALF or iALF-treatment under growth-permissive conditions, although RGC viability differed significantly in both groups. Intravitreal CO further increased the IRI-induced migration of GFAP-positive cells out of retinal explants and their transdifferentiation, which was detected by re-expression of beta-III tubulin and nestin.Intravitreal CORM ALF-186 protected RGC after IRI and stimulated their axons to regenerate in vitro. ALF conveyed anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and growth-associated signaling after IRI. CO's role in neuroregeneration and its effect on retinal glial cells needs further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2770101482,"Identifying lifestyle strategies and allied neurobiological mechanisms that reduce aging-related motor impairment is imperative, given the accelerating number of retirees and increased life expectancy. A physically active lifestyle prior to old age can reduce risk of debilitating motor decline. However, if exercise is initiated after motor decline has begun in the lifespan, it is unknown if aging itself may impose a limit on exercise efficacy to decelerate further aging-related motor decline. In Brown-Norway/Fischer 344 F1 hybrid (BNF) rats, locomotor activity begins to decrease in middle age (12–18 months). One mechanism of aging-related motor decline may be decreased expression of GDNF family receptor, GFRα-1, which is decreased in substantia nigra (SN) between 12 and 30 months old. Moderate exercise, beginning at 18 months old, increases nigral GFRα-1 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression within 2 months. In aged rats, replenishing aging-related loss of GFRα-1 in SN increases TH in SN alone and locomotor activity. A moderate exercise regimen was initiated in sedentary male BNF rats in a longitudinal study to evaluate if exercise could attenuate aging-related motor decline when initiated at two different ages in the latter half of the lifespan (18 or 24 months old). Motor decline was reversed in the 18-, but not 24-month-old, cohort. However, exercise efficacy in the 18-month-old group was reduced as the rats reached 27 months old. GFRα-1 expression was not increased in either cohort. These studies suggest exercise can decelerate motor decline when begun in the latter half of the lifespan, but its efficacy may be limited by age of initiation. Decreased plasticity of GFRα-1 expression following exercise may limit its efficacy to reverse motor decline."
https://openalex.org/W2770405389,"Coxiella burnetii is an obligate Gram-negative intracellular pathogen and the etiological agent of Q fever. Successful infection requires a functional Type IV secretion system, which translocates more than 100 effector proteins into the host cytosol to establish the infection, restructure the intracellular host environment, and create a parasitophorous vacuole where the replicating bacteria reside. We used yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening of 33 selected C. burnetii effectors against whole genome human and murine proteome libraries to generate a map of potential host-pathogen protein-protein interactions (PPIs). We detected 273 unique interactions between 20 pathogen and 247 human proteins, and 157 between 17 pathogen and 137 murine proteins. We used orthology to combine the data and create a single host-pathogen interaction network containing 415 unique interactions between 25 C. burnetii and 363 human proteins. We further performed complementary pairwise Y2H testing of 43 out of 91 C. burnetii-human interactions involving five pathogen proteins. We used the combined data to 1) perform enrichment analyses of target host cellular processes and pathways, 2) examine effectors with known infection phenotypes, and 3) infer potential mechanisms of action for four effectors with uncharacterized functions. The host-pathogen interaction profiles supported known Coxiella phenotypes, such as adapting cell morphology through cytoskeletal re-arrangements, protein processing and trafficking, organelle generation, cholesterol processing, innate immune modulation, and interactions with the ubiquitin and proteasome pathways. The generated dataset of PPIs—the largest collection of unbiased Coxiella host-pathogen interactions to date—represents a rich source of information with respect to secreted pathogen effector proteins and their interactions with human host proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2770060263,"Targeting metabolism is emerging as a promising therapeutic strategy for modulation of the immune response in human diseases. In the presented study we used the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated activation of RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cell line as a model to investigate changes in the metabolic phenotype and to test the effect of p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (pHPP) on it. pHPP is an intermediate of the PHE/TYR catabolic pathway, selected as analogue of the ethyl pyruvate (EP), which proved to exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The results obtained show that LPS-priming of RAW 264.7 cell line to the activated M1 state resulted in up-regulation of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and consequently of NO production and in release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. All these effects were prevented dose dependently by mM concentrations of pHPP more efficiently than EP. Respirometric and metabolic flux analysis of LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells unveiled a marked metabolic shift consisting in downregulation of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and upregulation of aerobic glycolysis respectively. The observed respiratory failure in LPS-treated cells was accompanied with inhibition of the respiratory chain complexes I and IV and enhanced production of reactive oxygen species. Inhibition of the respiratory activity was also observed following incubation of human neonatal fibroblasts (NHDF-neo) with sera from septic patients. pHPP prevented all the observed metabolic alteration caused by LPS on RAW 264.7 or by septic sera on NHDF-neo. Moreover, we provide evidence that pHPP is an efficient reductant of cytochrome c. On the basis of the presented results a working model, linking pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)-mediated immune response to mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, is put forward along with suggestions for its therapeutic control."

Socio-demographic data and the self-reported practice of 10 different co-benefit behaviours were solicited. Ethics approval and participant's verbal consent were sought.The study sample consisted of 1,017 respondents (response rate: 63.6%) were comparable to the age, gender and geographical distributions of the Hong Kong population found in the latest 2011 Hong Kong Population Census. Among the co-benefit behaviours, using less packaging and disposable shopping bags were practiced in the highest frequency (70.1%). However, four behaviours were found to have never been practiced by more than half of the respondents, including bringing personal eating utensils when dining in restaurants or small eateries, showering less than five minutes, having one vegetarian meal a week, and buying more organic food. Results of multivariable logistic regression showed that frequency of practicing co-benefit behaviours were consistently associated with gender and age.Urban residents in Hong Kong do not engage in the practice of co-benefit behaviours in a uniform way. In general, females and older people are more likely to adopt co-benefit behaviours in their daily lives. Further research to assess the knowledge and attitudes of the population towards these co-benefit behaviours will provide support to relevant climate change mitigation policies and education programmes."
https://openalex.org/W2769207314,"Osteoporosis leads to hip fractures in aging populations and is diagnosed by modern medical imaging techniques such as quantitative computed tomography (QCT). Hip fracture sites involve trabecular bone, whose strength is determined by volume fraction and orientation, known as fabric. However, bone fabric cannot be reliably assessed in clinical QCT images of proximal femur. Accordingly, we propose a novel registration-based estimation of bone fabric designed to preserve tensor properties of bone fabric and to map bone fabric by a global and local decomposition of the gradient of a non-rigid image registration transformation. Furthermore, no comprehensive analysis on the critical components of this methodology has been previously conducted. Hence, the aim of this work was to identify the best registration-based strategy to assign bone fabric to the QCT image of a patient's proximal femur. The normalized correlation coefficient and curvature-based regularization were used for image-based registration and the Frobenius norm of the stretch tensor of the local gradient was selected to quantify the distance among the proximal femora in the population. Based on this distance, closest, farthest and mean femora with a distinction of sex were chosen as alternative atlases to evaluate their influence on bone fabric prediction. Second, we analyzed different tensor mapping schemes for bone fabric prediction: identity, rotation-only, rotation and stretch tensor. Third, we investigated the use of a population average fabric atlas. A leave one out (LOO) evaluation study was performed with a dual QCT and HR-pQCT database of 36 pairs of human femora. The quality of the fabric prediction was assessed with three metrics, the tensor norm (TN) error, the degree of anisotropy (DA) error and the angular deviation of the principal tensor direction (PTD). The closest femur atlas (CTP) with a full rotation (CR) for fabric mapping delivered the best results with a TN error of 7.3 ± 0.9%, a DA error of 6.6 ± 1.3% and a PTD error of 25 ± 2°. The closest to the population mean femur atlas (MTP) using the same mapping scheme yielded only slightly higher errors than CTP for substantially less computing efforts. The population average fabric atlas yielded substantially higher errors than the MTP with the CR mapping scheme. Accounting for sex did not bring any significant improvements. The identified fabric mapping methodology will be exploited in patient-specific QCT-based finite element analysis of the proximal femur to improve the prediction of hip fracture risk."

The aim of this study was to investigate the infection by Leishmania in small mammals in an area located in Minas Gerais, Brazil, that undergoes changes in its natural environment and presents autochthonous human cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL). For the capture of the animals, Sherman and Tomahawk traps were used and distributed in the peridomicile of houses with reports of autochthonous cases of CL or VL. Six catches were carried out on two consecutive nights with intervals of two months during one year and samples of spleen, liver, tail skin, ear skin and bone marrow of the animals were obtained. Parasitological and molecular methods were used to detect the infection. Identification of the Leishmania species was performed by PCR RFLPhsp70. Twenty five animals of four species were captured: ten Rattus rattus, nine Didelphis albiventris, five Cerradomys subflavus and one Marmosops incanus. In the PCR-hsp70, five animals were positive (20%). The Leishmania species identified in PCR-RFLPhsp70 were: Leishmania braziliensis in D. albiventris (2), C. subflavus (1) and R. rattus (1) and Leishmania infantum in R. rattus (1). The highest positivity rate for L. braziliensis was obtained in the liver samples. The spleen was the only tissue positive for L. infantum. It was isolated in culture medium L. braziliensis from two samples (liver and spleen) of R. rattus. This is the first record of isolation of L. braziliensis from R. rattus in the southeastern region of Brazil. These results are relevant to the knowledge of the epidemiology of leishmaniasis in the region, mainly in the investigation of the presence of hosts and possible reservoirs of the parasite."
https://openalex.org/W2768654450,"Background The placement of fixed orthodontic appliances may alter the composition of oral microbiota and has the potential risk of periodontal complication. Porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae play a critical role in colonization of P. gingivalis in subgingival regions. In this study, we investigated the association between the prevalence of P. gingivalis-specific fimA genotypes and periodontal health status in adolescent orthodontic patients, to identify the pathogencity of P. gingivalis during orthodontic therapy. Methods Sixty-one adolescent orthodontic patients were enrolled in the case group, while the control group consisted of 56 periodontally healthy adolescents. At baseline (T0), clinical parameter (gingival index) was tested, and subgingival plaque samples were obtained from the lower incisors. The incidences of P. gingivalis and fimA genotypes were detected by polymerase chain reaction. All parameters were reassessed after 1 month (T1), 2 months (T2), 3 months (T3), and 6 months (T4) in the case group and then compared with those of the controls. Results Both microbiological and clinical parameters from orthodontic patients started to increase after placement of fixed appliances. Maximum values were reached at 3 months after placement and followed by their decreases at six months. However, the microbiological and clinical parameters in the case group were significantly higher than those of the control group. The GI of fimA II, IV-positive samples was significantly higher than that of negative samples. Conclusion P. gingivalis carrying fimA II or IV was closely related to orthodontic gingivitis. In addition, proper oral hygiene control could lead to little increase in dental plaque accumulation, and exert a beneficial effect to periodontal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2770187445,"Background As access to antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa continues to expand, more women with HIV can expect to survive through their reproductive years. Modern contraceptives can help women choose the timing and spacing of childbearing. However, concerns remain that women with HIV who use non-barrier forms of modern contraception may engage in more condomless sex because of their decreased risk of unintended pregnancy. We examined whether non-barrier modern contraceptive use by HIV-positive female sex workers was associated with increased frequency of recent condomless sex, measured by detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in vaginal secretions. Methods Women who were HIV-positive and reported transactional sex were included in this analysis. Pregnant and post-menopausal follow-up time was excluded, as were visits at which women reported trying to get pregnant. At enrollment and quarterly follow-up visits, a pelvic speculum examination with collection of vaginal secretions was conducted for detection of PSA. In addition, women completed a structured face-to-face interview about their current contraceptive methods and sexual risk behavior at enrollment and monthly follow-up visits. Log-binomial generalized estimating equations regression was used to test for associations between non-barrier modern contraceptive use and detection of PSA in vaginal secretions and self-reported condomless sex. Data from October 2012 through September 2014 were included in this analysis. Results Overall, 314 women contributed 1,583 quarterly examination visits. There was minimal difference in PSA detection at contraceptive-exposed versus contraceptive-unexposed visits (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 1.28, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.93–1.76). There was a higher rate of self-reported condomless sex at visits where women reported using modern contraceptives, but this difference was not statistically significant after adjustment for potential confounding factors (aRR 1.59, 95% CI 0.98–2.58). Conclusion Non-barrier methods of modern contraception were not associated with increased risk of objective evidence of condomless sex."
https://openalex.org/W2770600763,"Introduction Lung Clearance Index (LCI) is recognised as an early marker of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. The effect of posture on LCI however is important when considering longitudinal measurements from infancy and when comparing LCI to imaging studies. Methods 35 children with CF and 28 healthy controls (HC) were assessed. Multiple breath washout (MBW) was performed both sitting and supine in triplicate and analysed for LCI, Scond, Sacin, and lung volumes. These values were also corrected for the Fowler dead-space to create ‘alveolar’ indices. Results From sitting to supine there was a significant increase in LCI and a significant decrease in FRC for both CF and HC (p<0.01). LCI, when adjusted to estimate ‘alveolar’ LCI (LCIalv), increased the magnitude of change with posture for both LCIalv and FRCalv in both groups, with a greater effect of change in lung volume in HC compared with children with CF. The % change in LCIalv for all subjects correlated significantly with lung volume % changes, most notably tidal volume/functional residual capacity (Vtalv/FRCalv (r = 0.54,p<0.001)). Conclusion There is a significant increase in LCI from sitting to supine, which we believe to be in part due to changes in lung volume and also increasing ventilation heterogeneity related to posture. This may have implications in longitudinal measurements from infancy to older childhood and for studies comparing supine imaging methods to LCI."

This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of tobacco consumption and nicotine dependence among smokers in an Angolan population and considering individual socio-demographic and behavioural characteristics. A community-based survey with 2,472 respondents (age range: 15-64 years) was conducted in 2013-2014 in the country's Bengo Province. The collection methodology for assessing each type of tobacco consumption and its daily quantification followed the World Health Organization STEPwise approach to chronic disease risk factor surveillance. The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence was also used to assess smokers. Mean values for prevalence of tobacco use and nicotine dependence were estimated by sex and by previously defined variables. Daily smoking (6.1%) was found to be higher for males (10.0%) them among females (2.6%), and the amount of ex-smokers (7.5%) was higher them smokers. Only 0.2% of those surveyed reported use of smokeless (chewing) tobacco. One-third of ever-smokers reported having started smoking daily before age 18. Nicotine dependence levels were classified as very low or low in 83.6% of the smokers. Daily smoking prevalence increased with age, and was higher in rural areas and among individuals with no formal education, lower incomes, and alcohol consumption. This population presented a low smoking prevalence, along with a low number of daily smoked cigarettes and low levels of nicotine dependency, despite the low prices of, and easy access to, manufactured cigarettes. These two factors conjugated with the current absence of an Angolan policy for tobacco control, enhance the susceptibility for rising overall tobacco use in the near future."

In a later test phase, a single object was presented in all four quadrants, and participants verbally reported whether the object was new or previously seen (item recognition), and if it was previously seen, they indicated the original screen location (source memory). We combined this test with eye-tracking to determine whether attention to an object during encoding would correlate with later recognition of the object and memory of its source location, and whether eye movements at test can reveal attention to the correct source location in the absence of correct explicit verbal responses. The amount of time spent looking at an object during encoding was not related to later object recognition or source recollection. However, we found that eye movements at test reveal retention of source information about an object in the absence of accurate retrieval of source information as assessed by verbal response. When participants correctly recognized an object but incorrectly indicated the source information, significantly more time was spent looking at the correct source location than to incorrect, non-selected locations. Moreover, when participants correctly recognized an object but said they could not remember the source information, significantly more time was spent looking at the correct source location. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that eye movements are sensitive to attention or other graded mental processes which can underlie the retrieval of source memories that can then be expressed verbally in a thresholded manner."
https://openalex.org/W2770201109,"The incidence of melanoma, particularly in older patients, has steadily increased over the past few decades. Activating mutations of BRAF, the majority occurring in BRAFV600, are frequently detected in melanoma; however, the prognostic significance remains unclear. This study aimed to define the probability and distribution of BRAFV600 mutations, and the clinico-pathological factors that may affect BRAF mutation status, in patients with advanced melanoma using next-generation sequencing.This was a non-interventional, retrospective study of BRAF mutation testing at two German centers, in Heidelberg and Tübingen. Archival tumor samples from patients with histologically confirmed melanoma (stage IIIB, IIIC, IV) were analyzed using PCR amplification and deep sequencing. Clinical, histological, and mutation data were collected. The statistical influence of patient- and tumor-related characteristics on BRAFV600 mutation status was assessed using multiple logistic regression (MLR) and a prediction profiler.BRAFV600 mutation status was assessed in 453 samples. Mutations were detected in 57.6% of patients (n = 261), with 48.1% (n = 102) at the Heidelberg site and 66.0% (n = 159) at the Tübingen site. The decreasing influence of increasing age on mutation probability was quantified. A main effects MLR model identified age (p = 0.0001), center (p = 0.0004), and melanoma subtype (p = 0.014) as significantly influencing BRAFV600 mutation probability; ultraviolet (UV) exposure showed a statistical trend (p = 0.1419). An interaction model of age versus other variables showed that center (p<0.0001) and melanoma subtype (p = 0.0038) significantly influenced BRAF mutation probability; age had a statistically significant effect only as part of an interaction with both UV exposure (p = 0.0110) and melanoma subtype (p = 0.0134).This exploratory study highlights that testing center, melanoma subtype, and age in combination with UV exposure and melanoma subtype significantly influence BRAFV600 mutation probability in patients with melanoma. Further validation of this model, in terms of reproducibility and broader relevance, is required."
https://openalex.org/W2770420472,"At present, there is no objective method for diagnosing subjective sensorineural tinnitus. Recently, the acoustic change complex (ACC) has been used to evaluate neural detection of sounds. Thus, the present study aimed to examine whether the ACC can reflect cortical detection and discrimination of sounds matched with tinnitus frequencies. We hypothesized that the ACC to change stimuli matched with tinnitus frequencies would be decreased in tinnitus patients because the tinnitus interferes with the perception of acoustic changes. To test the hypothesis, 96 ears of normal-hearing (NH) tinnitus patients and controls were tested. Among the tinnitus patients, 33 ears with a tinnitus frequency of 8 kHz constituted the tinnitus group, and the remaining 63 ears with no experience of tinnitus were allocated to the control group. For the 4 kHz non-tinnitus matched frequency, a subset of tinnitus (n = 17) and NH (n = 47) subjects was tested. The acoustic stimuli were pure tones with a total duration of 500 ms consisting of a 1 kHz tone in the first 250 ms and a second tone of either 8 kHz or 4 kHz in the latter 250 ms. The normalized amplitude of the ACC (naACC) was calculated separately for the amplitude of the N1'-P2' complex evoked by an 8 kHz or 4 kHz change stimulus and for the amplitude of the N1-P2 complex elicited by the initial 1 kHz background stimulus. Our results showed that the naACC to an 8 kHz stimulus in the tinnitus group was significantly smaller than those to 4 kHz and 8 kHz in normal controls. Additionally, in the tinnitus group, the naACC to 4 kHz was greater compared to 8 kHz. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis conducted for naACC to 8 kHz at UCL revealed a fair degree of diagnostic efficacy. Overall, our results indicated that the ACC to a change stimulus matched with the tinnitus frequency can provide an objective measure of frequency-specific tinnitus."
https://openalex.org/W2770878632,"To evaluate the interobserver reliability and value of diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) in the assessment of uterine tumors compared with those of conventional diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).This retrospective study was approved by our institutional review board, which waived the requirement for informed consent. Fifty-eight women (mean age: 55.0 ± 13.6 years; range: 30-89 years) with suspected malignant uterine tumors underwent 3-T magnetic resonance imaging using DKI and DWI. Twelve had coexisting leiomyoma. Two observers analyzed region-of-interest measurements of diffusivity (D), kurtosis (K), and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of uterine lesions and healthy adjacent tissues. Interobserver agreement was evaluated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). The mean values were compared using one-way analysis of variance with a post-hoc Tukey's honestly significant difference test. The diagnostic accuracy of D and ADC in differentiating malignant tumors from benign leiomyomas was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.The ICCs between the two observers in evaluating D, K, and the ADC of the malignant tumors were higher than 0.84, suggesting excellent interobserver agreements. The mean D (×10-3 mm2/s) of uterine cancers (1.05 ± 0.41 and 1.09 ± 0.40 for observers 1 and 2, respectively) were significantly lower than those of leiomyoma (1.40 ± 0.37 and 1.56 ± 0.33, respectively; P < 0.05), healthy myometrium (1.72 ± 0.27 and 1.69 ± 0.30, respectively; P < 0.001), and healthy endometrium (1.53 ± 0.35 and 1.42 ± 0.37, respectively; P < 0.005). There was no significant difference in the area under the ROC curve between D and ADC. The mean K of uterine cancers (0.88 ± 0.28 and 0.90 ± 0.23, respectively) were higher than those of myometrium (0.72 ± 0.10 and 0.73 ± 0.10, respectively; P < 0.001), healthy endometrium (0.65 ± 0.13 and 0.60 ± 0.18, respectively; P < 0.001), and leiomyoma (0.76 ± 0.14 and 0.77 ± 0.16, respectively; not significant, P > 0.1).Interobserver agreements in evaluating D, K, and ADC were moderate to excellent. D performed equally to conventional DWI in differentiating between benign and malignant uterine lesions. The mean K of malignant uterine lesions was significantly higher than that of non-tumorous myometrium or endometrium."
https://openalex.org/W2770244212,"This study explored the association of the affective experience (AE) of life events on hopelessness depression (HD). Undergraduates (N = 301) participating in a 12-week prospective study completed measures of HD, cognitive style, and psychological stress. The results indicate AE is an underlying mechanism influencing the longitudinal link between life events and HD. Negative life events with clear negative AE directly promoted the development of HD. Positive life events with clear positive AE directly impeded the development of HD. Neutral life events with mixed AE directly and interacting with negative cognitive style promoted the development of HD. The results should increase understanding of the hopelessness theory of depression, and suggest that neutral life events should be important elements in depression therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2769209173,"We study the effects of different punishment institutions on cooperation in a six-person prisoner’s dilemma game in which actors observe others’ cooperation with some noise (i.e. imperfect public monitoring). Previous research has shown that peer punishment can sustain cooperation, if a certain proportion of group members punish defectors at a cost to themselves. However, in the presence of noise, co-operators will sometimes be mistaken for defectors and punished, and defectors will sometimes be mistaken for co-operators and escape punishment. Both types of mistakes are detrimental for cooperation because cooperation is discouraged and defection is encouraged. By means of a laboratory experiment, we study whether this adverse effect of noise can be mitigated by consensual punishment. The more other group members have to agree on punishing a defector, the less likely will a co-operator be punished by mistake. We compare a punishment institution in which each subject decides individually whether to punish another, with institutions in which punishments are only implemented if subjects reach sufficient consensus that a particular group member should be punished. In conditions without noise, we find that cooperation and subjects’ payoffs are higher if more consensus is required before a punishment is implemented. In conditions with noise, cooperation is lower if more consensus is required. Moreover, with noise, subjects’ payoffs are lower under all punishment institutions than in the control condition without punishment opportunities. Our results narrow down the conditions under which punishment institutions can promote cooperation if such cooperation is noisy."
https://openalex.org/W4237454773,"The scientific community has been divided as to the origin of individual differences in perceiving the sounds of a second language (L2). There are two alternative explanations: a general psychoacoustic origin vs. a speech-specific one. A previous study showed that such individual variability is linked to the perceivers' speech-specific capabilities, rather than the perceivers' psychoacoustic abilities. However, we assume that the selection of participants and parameters of sound stimuli might not appropriate. Therefore, we adjusted the sound stimuli and recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) from two groups of early, proficient Cantonese (L1)-Mandarin (L2) bilinguals who differed in their mastery of the Mandarin (L2) phonetic contrast /in-ing/, to explore whether the individual differences in perceiving L2 stem from participants' ability to discriminate various pure tones (frequency, duration and pattern). To precisely measure the participants' acoustic discrimination, mismatch negativity (MMN) elicited by the oddball paradigm was recorded in the experiment. The results showed that significant differences between good perceivers (GPs) and poor perceivers (PPs) were found in the three general acoustic conditions (frequency, duration and pattern), and the MMN amplitude for GP was significantly larger than for PP. Therefore, our results support a general psychoacoustic origin of individual variability in L2 phonetic mastery."
https://openalex.org/W2769377364,"Homing pigeons are known for their excellent homing ability, and their brains seem to be functionally adapted to homing. It is known that pigeons with navigational experience show a larger hippocampus and also a more lateralised brain than pigeons without navigational experience. So we hypothesized that experience may have an influence also on orientation ability. We examined two groups of pigeons (11 with navigational experience and 17 without) in a standard operant chamber with a touch screen monitor showing a 2-D schematic of a rectangular environment (as “geometric” information) and one uniquely shaped and colored feature in each corner (as “landmark” information). Pigeons were trained first for pecking on one of these features and then we examined their ability to encode geometric and landmark information in four tests by modifying the rectangular environment. All tests were done under binocular and monocular viewing to test hemispheric dominance. The number of pecks was counted for analysis. Results show that generally both groups orientate on the basis of landmarks and the geometry of environment, but landmark information was preferred. Pigeons with navigational experience did not perform better on the tests but showed a better conjunction of the different kinds of information. Significant differences between monocular and binocular viewing were detected particularly in pigeons without navigational experience on two tests with reduced information. Our data suggest that the conjunction of geometric and landmark information might be integrated after processing separately in each hemisphere and that this process is influenced by experience."
