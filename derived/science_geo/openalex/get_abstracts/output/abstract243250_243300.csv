https://openalex.org/W1575492558,"Magnetoelectric multiferroics combine ferromagnetism (a spontaneous magnetization that can be switched by a magnetic field) and ferroelectricity (a spontaneous electric polarization that can be switched by an electric field) in the same phase. They have tremendous potential for applications, not only because they possess the properties of both parent phenomena, but also because coupling between ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity can lead to additional novel effects. In their Perspective,
 Spaldin and Fiebig
 discuss the factors behind the recent resurgence of interest in magnetoelectric multiferroics, describe some exciting results emerging from the current research activities, and point to important challenges and directions for future work."
https://openalex.org/W2153029275,"Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) accumulate in tissues of mammalian species and have been hypothesized to contribute to aging. We show that mice expressing a proofreading-deficient version of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase g (POLG) accumulate mtDNA mutations and display features of accelerated aging. Accumulation of mtDNA mutations was not associated with increased markers of oxidative stress or a defect in cellular proliferation, but was correlated with the induction of apoptotic markers, particularly in tissues characterized by rapid cellular turnover. The levels of apoptotic markers were also found to increase during aging in normal mice. Thus, accumulation of mtDNA mutations that promote apoptosis may be a central mechanism driving mammalian aging."
https://openalex.org/W2135309154,"Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are the most common intraneuronal inclusion in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases and have been implicated in mediating neuronal death and cognitive deficits. Here, we found that mice expressing a repressible human tau variant developed progressive age-related NFTs, neuronal loss, and behavioral impairments. After the suppression of transgenic tau, memory function recovered, and neuron numbers stabilized, but to our surprise, NFTs continued to accumulate. Thus, NFTs are not sufficient to cause cognitive decline or neuronal death in this model of tauopathy."

We present the sequence and analysis of the 11 megabase-sized chromosomes of Trypanosoma brucei. The 26-megabase genome contains 9068 predicted genes, including approximately 900 pseudogenes and approximately 1700 T. brucei-specific genes. Large subtelomeric arrays contain an archive of 806 variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes used by the parasite to evade the mammalian immune system. Most VSG genes are pseudogenes, which may be used to generate expressed mosaic genes by ectopic recombination. Comparisons of the cytoskeleton and endocytic trafficking systems with those of humans and other eukaryotic organisms reveal major differences. A comparison of metabolic pathways encoded by the genomes of T. brucei, T. cruzi, and Leishmania major reveals the least overall metabolic capability in T. brucei and the greatest in L. major. Horizontal transfer of genes of bacterial origin has contributed to some of the metabolic differences in these parasites, and a number of novel potential drug targets have been identified."

https://openalex.org/W2155159495,"Whole-genome sequencing of the protozoan pathogen Trypanosoma cruzi revealed that the diploid genome contains a predicted 22,570 proteins encoded by genes, of which 12,570 represent allelic pairs. Over 50% of the genome consists of repeated sequences, such as retrotransposons and genes for large families of surface molecules, which include trans-sialidases, mucins, gp63s, and a large novel family (&gt;1300 copies) of mucin-associated surface protein (MASP) genes. Analyses of the T. cruzi, T. brucei , and Leishmania major (Tritryp) genomes imply differences from other eukaryotes in DNA repair and initiation of replication and reflect their unusual mitochondrial DNA. Although the Tritryp lack several classes of signaling molecules, their kinomes contain a large and diverse set of protein kinases and phosphatases; their size and diversity imply previously unknown interactions and regulatory processes, which may be targets for intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2168799765,"Leishmania species cause a spectrum of human diseases in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. We have sequenced the 36 chromosomes of the 32.8-megabase haploid genome of Leishmania major (Friedlin strain) and predict 911 RNA genes, 39 pseudogenes, and 8272 protein-coding genes, of which 36% can be ascribed a putative function. These include genes involved in host-pathogen interactions, such as proteolytic enzymes, and extensive machinery for synthesis of complex surface glycoconjugates. The organization of protein-coding genes into long, strand-specific, polycistronic clusters and lack of general transcription factors in the L. major, Trypanosoma brucei, and Trypanosoma cruzi (Tritryp) genomes suggest that the mechanisms regulating RNA polymerase II-directed transcription are distinct from those operating in other eukaryotes, although the trypanosomatids appear capable of chromatin remodeling. Abundant RNA-binding proteins are encoded in the Tritryp genomes, consistent with active posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression."

Relative to that of bulk, the rate of structural relaxation of poly(methyl methacrylate) is reduced by a factor of 2 at a free surface and by a factor of 15 at a silica substrate interface; the latter exhibits a nearly complete arresting of relaxation. The distribution in relaxation rates extends more than 100 nanometers into the film interior, a distance greater than that over which surfaces and interfaces affect the glass transition temperature."

https://openalex.org/W2020896705,"To complement the sequencing of the three kinetoplastid genomes reported in this issue, we have undertaken a whole-organism, proteomic analysis of the four life-cycle stages of Trypanosoma cruzi . Peptides mapping to 2784 proteins in 1168 protein groups from the annotated T. cruzi genome were identified across the four life-cycle stages. Protein products were identified from &gt;1000 genes annotated as “hypothetical” in the sequenced genome, including members of a newly defined gene family annotated as mucin-associated surface proteins. The four parasite stages appear to use distinct energy sources, including histidine for stages present in the insect vectors and fatty acids by intracellular amastigotes."
https://openalex.org/W2049798802,"Certain pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis , survive within the hostile intracellular environment of a macrophage. To identify host factors required for mycobacterial entry and survival within macrophages, we performed a genomewide RNA interference screen in Drosophila macrophage-like cells, using Mycobacterium fortuitum . We identified factors required for general phagocytosis, as well as those needed specifically for mycobacterial infection. One specific factor, Peste (Pes), is a CD36 family member required for uptake of mycobacteria, but not Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus . Moreover, mammalian class B scavenger receptors (SRs) conferred uptake of bacteria into nonphagocytic cells, with SR-BI and SR-BII uniquely mediating uptake of M. fortuitum , which suggests a conserved role for class B SRs in pattern recognition and innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2076225138,"We identified a locus on chromosome 6q16.3-q24.2 (ref. 1) associated with childhood obesity that includes 2.4 Mb common to eight genome scans for type 2 diabetes (T2D) or obesity. Analysis of the gene ENPP1 (also called PC-1), a candidate for insulin resistance, in 6,147 subjects showed association between a three-allele risk haplotype (K121Q, IVS20delT-11 and A-->G+1044TGA; QdelTG) and childhood obesity (odds ratio (OR) = 1.69, P = 0.0006), morbid or moderate obesity in adults (OR = 1.50, P = 0.006 or OR = 1.37, P = 0.02, respectively) and T2D (OR = 1.56, P = 0.00002). The Genotype IBD Sharing Test suggested that this obesity-associated ENPP1 risk haplotype contributes to the observed chromosome 6q linkage with childhood obesity. The haplotype confers a higher risk of glucose intolerance and T2D to obese children and their parents and associates with increased serum levels of soluble ENPP1 protein in children. Expression of a long ENPP1 mRNA isoform, which includes the obesity-associated A-->G+1044TGA SNP, was specific for pancreatic islet beta cells, adipocytes and liver. These findings suggest that several variants of ENPP1 have a primary role in mediating insulin resistance and in the development of both obesity and T2D, suggesting that an underlying molecular mechanism is common to both conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2086488187,"In everyday life, the successful monitoring of behavior requires continuous updating of the effectiveness of motor acts; one crucial step is becoming aware of the movements one is performing. We studied the anatomical distribution of lesions in right-brain-damaged hemiplegic patients, who obstinately denied their motor impairment, claiming that they could move their paralyzed limbs. Denial was associated with lesions in areas related to the programming of motor acts, particularly Brodmann's premotor areas 6 and 44, motor area 4, and the somatosensory cortex. This association suggests that monitoring systems may be implemented within the same cortical network that is responsible for the primary function that has to be monitored."
https://openalex.org/W2149616337,"Apolipoprotein L-I is the trypanolytic factor of human serum. Here we show that this protein contains a membrane pore-forming domain functionally similar to that of bacterial colicins, flanked by a membrane-addressing domain. In lipid bilayer membranes, apolipoprotein L-I formed anion channels. In Trypanosoma brucei , apolipoprotein L-I was targeted to the lysosomal membrane and triggered depolarization of this membrane, continuous influx of chloride, and subsequent osmotic swelling of the lysosome until the trypanosome lysed."
https://openalex.org/W1980142871,"Dystrophin deficiency causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in humans, an inherited and progressive disease of striated muscle deterioration that frequently involves pronounced cardiomyopathy. Heart failure is the second leading cause of fatalities in DMD. Progress towards defining the molecular basis of disease in DMD has mostly come from studies on skeletal muscle, with comparatively little attention directed to cardiac muscle. The pathophysiological mechanisms involved in cardiac myocytes may differ significantly from skeletal myofibres; this is underscored by the presence of significant cardiac disease in patients with truncated or reduced levels of dystrophin but without skeletal muscle disease. Here we show that intact, isolated dystrophin-deficient cardiac myocytes have reduced compliance and increased susceptibility to stretch-mediated calcium overload, leading to cell contracture and death, and that application of the membrane sealant poloxamer 188 corrects these defects in vitro. In vivo administration of poloxamer 188 to dystrophic mice instantly improved ventricular geometry and blocked the development of acute cardiac failure during a dobutamine-mediated stress protocol. Once issues relating to optimal dosing and long-term effects of poloxamer 188 in humans have been resolved, chemical-based membrane sealants could represent a new therapeutic approach for preventing or reversing the progression of cardiomyopathy and heart failure in muscular dystrophy."

Here, we report a genome-wide RNA interference screen to identify host factors required for intracellular bacterial pathogenesis. Using Drosophila cells and the cytosolic pathogen Listeria monocytogenes , we identified 305 double-stranded RNAs targeting a wide range of cellular functions that altered L. monocytogenes infection. Comparison to a similar screen with Mycobacterium fortuitum , a vacuolar pathogen, identified host factors that may play a general role in intracellular pathogenesis and factors that specifically affect access to the cytosol by L. monocytogenes ."
https://openalex.org/W1966386667,"Many biological membranes adapt in response to environmental conditions. We investigated how the composition and architecture of photosynthetic membranes of a bacterium change in response to light, using atomic force microscopy. Despite large modifications in the membrane composition, the local environment of core complexes remained unaltered, whereas specialized paracrystalline light-harvesting antenna domains grew under low-light conditions. Thus, the protein mixture in the membrane shows eutectic behavior and can be mimicked by a simple model. Such structural adaptation ensures efficient photon capture under low-light conditions and prevents photodamage under high-light conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2090822519,"Double-stranded RNA molecules targeted to gene promoter regions can induce transcriptional gene silencing in a DNA cytosine methylation-dependent manner in plants (RNA-dependent DNA methylation). Whether a similar mechanism exists in mammalian systems is a vital and controversial issue. DNA methylation is an important component in mammalian gene silencing for normal processes such as gene imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation, and aberrant CpG island hypermethylation at tumor-suppressor promoters is associated with transcriptional silencing and loss of gene function in cancer. Hence, we investigated whether RNA-dependent DNA methylation might operate in human cancers to mediate epigenetic silencing using the endogenous gene CDH1 as a potential target. The loss of this cell-cell adhesion factor facilitates the metastatic process, and its promoter is frequently hypermethylated in breast and other cancers. We found that, although small double-stranded RNAs targeted exclusively to the CDH1 promoter could effectively induce transcriptional repression with chromatin changes characteristic of inactive promoters, this was entirely independent of DNA methylation. Moreover, we could accomplish such silencing in a cancer cell line genetically modified to lack virtually any capacity to methylate DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2048658861,"Long-range atmospheric transport of pollutants is generally assumed to be the main vector for arctic contamination, because local pollution sources are rare. We show that arctic seabirds, which occupy high trophic levels in marine food webs, are the dominant vectors for the transport of marine-derived contaminants to coastal ponds. The sediments of ponds most affected by seabirds had 60 times higher DDT, 25 times higher mercury, and 10 times higher hexachlorobenzene concentrations than nearby control sites. Bird guano greatly stimulates biological productivity in these extreme environments but also serves as a major source of industrial and agricultural pollutants in these remote ecosystems."

https://openalex.org/W2069793801,"We report direct structural evidence of the bridged radical (CH 2 ICH 2 ·) in a polar solution, obtained using time-resolved liquid-phase x-ray diffraction. This transient intermediate has long been hypothesized to explain stereo-chemical control in many association and/or dissociation reactions involving haloalkanes. Ultrashort optical pulses were used to dissociate an iodine atom from the haloethane molecule (C 2 H 4 I 2 ) dissolved in methanol, and the diffraction of picosecond x-ray pulses from a synchrotron supports the following structural dynamics, with ∼0.01 angstrom spatial resolution and ∼100 picosecond time resolution: The loss of one iodine atom from C 2 H 4 I 2 leads to the C-I-C triangular geometry of CH 2 ICH 2 ·. This transient C 2 H 4 I then binds to an iodine atom to form a new species, the C 2 H 4 I-I isomer, which eventually decays into C 2 H 4 + I 2 . Solvent dynamics were also extracted from the data, revealing a change in the solvent cage geometry, heating, and thermal expansion."
https://openalex.org/W1966397048,"The evolutionarily conserved DOCK180 protein has an indispensable role in cell migration by functioning as an exchange factor for Rac GTPase via its DOCK homology region (DHR)-2 domain. We report here that the conserved DHR-1 domain also has an important signalling role. A form of DOCK180 that lacks DHR-1 fails to promote cell migration, although it is capable of inducing Rac GTP-loading. The DHR-1 domain interacts with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in vitro and in vivo, and mediates the DOCK180 signalling complex localization at sites of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation in the cell's leading edge. A form of DOCK180 in which the DHR-1 domain has been replaced by a canonical PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-binding pleckstrin homology domain is fully functional at inducing cell elongation and migration, suggesting that the main function of DHR-1 is to bind PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. These results demonstrate that DOCK180, via its DHR-1 and DHR-2 domains, couples PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signalling to Rac GTP-loading, which is essential for directional cell movement."

https://openalex.org/W2045093866,"In mammals, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) projections initially intermingle and then segregate into a stereotyped pattern of eye-specific layers in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). Here we found that in mice deficient for ephrin-A2, ephrin-A3 and ephrin-A5, eye-specific inputs segregated but the shape and location of eye-specific layers were profoundly disrupted. In contrast, mice that lacked correlated retinal activity did not segregate eye-specific inputs. Inhibition of correlated neural activity in ephrin mutants led to overlapping retinal projections that were located in inappropriate regions of the dLGN. Thus, ephrin-As and neural activity act together to control patterning of eye-specific retinogeniculate layers."

https://openalex.org/W2010575732,"Neurotransmitter release is well known to occur at specialized synaptic regions that include presynaptic active zones and postsynaptic densities. At cholinergic synapses in the chick ciliary ganglion, however, membrane formations and physiological measurements suggest that release distant from postsynaptic densities can activate the predominantly extrasynaptic α7 nicotinic receptor subtype. We explored such ectopic neurotransmission with a novel model synapse that combines Monte Carlo simulations with high-resolution serial electron microscopic tomography. Simulated synaptic activity is consistent with experimental recordings of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents only when ectopic transmission is included in the model, broadening the possibilities for mechanisms of neuronal communication."

Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). A central role in this neurological disorder is played by the abundant, presynaptic 140-residue proteinα-synuclein (αS). αS is the major component of Lewy bodies (2Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (6177) Google Scholar), and locus triplication causing an increased dosage of the wild type (wt) αS gene potentiates PD (3Singleton A.B. Farrer M.

Two autosomal dominantly inherited forms of PD are caused by Ala53 to Thr (A53T) and Ala30 to Pro (A30P) mutations in the αS gene, which were identified in Italian (4Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C.

Both αS mutants display an impaired degradation by chaperone-mediated autophagy (6Cuervo A.M. Stefanis L. Fredenburg R. Lansbury P.T. Sulzer D. Science. 2004; 305: 1292-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar) and share an increased tendency to form soluble oligomeric intermediates, with the A53T mutant fibrillating even faster than the wt protein (7Conway K.A.

Recent reports suggest that these soluble oligomers, or protofibrils, may constitute the major toxic species, whereas mature fibrils may account for a protective function (8Volles M.J. Lansbury P.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7871-7878Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). As the loss of αS appears to have minimal effects on development (9Abeliovich A. Schmitz Y. Farinas I. Choi-Lundberg D. Ho W.H. Castillo P.E. Shinsky N. Verdugo J.M.G. Armanini M. Ryan A. Hynes M. Phillips H. Sulzer D. Rosenthal A. Neuron. 2000; 25: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar), the pathogenic effects of mutant αS are attributed to a toxic gain-offunction. These findings are intriguing inasmuch as αS has generally been considered as an intrinsically unstructured protein (10Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Why and how single missense mutations in disordered αS accelerate its oligomerization and contribute to the degeneration of dopamine nerve cells are questions fundamental to the understanding and treatment of PD. Recently, it was shown that native αS adopts an ensemble of conformations that are stabilized by long range interactions (11Hoyer W. Cherny D. Subramaniam V. Jovin T.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16233-16242Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 12Dedmon M.M. Lindorff-Larsen K. Christodoulou J. Vendruscolo M. Dobson C.M. J. Am. Chem.

The latter form an intricate network involving the N (residues 1–60) and C termini (residues 109–140), which shields the highly amyloidogenic, non-Aβ component of Alzheimer disease amyloid (NAC) (residues 61–95) from the solvent (Fig. 1A). Polyamine binding and temperature increase release the intrinsic tertiary structure of αS, leading to a completely unfolded conformation (13Bertoncini C.W. Jung Y.S. Fernandez C.O. Hoyer W. Griesinger C. Jovin T.M. Zweckstetter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1430-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The relevance of these conditions, which cause aggregation in vitro, for the development of PD is, however, unclear. On the other hand, very strong support for the importance of αS in PD comes from the A30P and A53T mutations in the αS gene linked to familial forms of the disease. Using NMR residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and parmaagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) we demonstrate here that Parkinsonism-linked mutations greatly perturb the ensemble of α-synuclein conformers. This conformationally altered αS may constitute a common mediator in the induction of PD by both environmental and genetic conditions. Protein Preparation—PT7 plasmids containing wt, A30P, and A53T αS sequences were a gift from the Lansbury Laboratory, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA. The following αS cysteine-containing mutants were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) on the above mentioned plasmids: Ala18Cys/A30P, Ala90Cys/A30P, Ala140Cys/A30P, Ala18Cys/A53T, Ala90Cys/A53T, and Ala140Cys/A53T. The introduced modifications were further verified by DNA sequencing. The positions of the cysteine replacements was distributed along the sequence of αS and their introduction did not cause chemical shift changes in residues other than those surrounding the point of mutation. 15N-labeled αS, wt, and mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) and purified as described previously (15Hoyer W. Antony T. Cherny D. Heim G. Jovin T.M. Subramaniam V. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The final protein working solutions were dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl). Spin Labeling of αS—The nitroxide spin label chosen for reaction with the cysteine-containing mutants was MTSL (1-oxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-d-pyrroline-3-methyl)-methanethiosulfonate (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). MTSL had already proven to efficiently react with αS cysteine mutants, and the reaction was carried out as described previously (13Bertoncini C.W. Jung Y.S. Fernandez C.O. Hoyer W. Griesinger C. Jovin T.M. Zweckstetter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1430-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Paramagnetic samples were measured at 100 μm MTSL-labeled protein concentration, and diamagnetic experiments were performed with 100 μm protein in the presence of 0.5 mm dithiotreithol (Sigma) to counteract undesirable intensity changes in certain amide resonances of αS caused by addition of the oxidant ascorbic acid. Alignment of αS in Anisotropic Media—RDCs were measured in αS variants aligned in 5% w/v n-octyl-penta(ethylene glycol)/octanol (C8E5) (Sigma) (16Rückert M. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 7793-7797Crossref Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Formation of the anisotropic, dilute liquid crystalline phase was monitored by the splitting of the deuterium signal, which was 20 ± 2 Hz. Alternatively, alignment was achieved by addition of 10 mg/ml of Pf1 bacteriophage (Asla, Riga, Latvia) with deuterium splittings of 9 ± 1 Hz (17Hansen M.R. Mueller L. Pardi A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). NMR Measurements—NMR spectra were acquired at 15 °C on Bruker Avance 600 and 700 NMR spectrometers on a 100 μm sample of αS variants in buffer A. Measurement conditions of low temperature and absence of stirring were chosen to suppress oligomerization. PRE profiles were derived from the measurement of the peak intensity ratios from two two-dimensional 15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectra aquiered in the presence and absence of the nitroxide radical. Spectra were recorded using 256 × 1024 complex data points in F1 and F2 dimensions with 16 scans per increment and a relaxation delay of 1.2 s. The spectral widths were 1650 and 5500 Hz in the 15N and 1H dimensions, respectively. One-bond N-H residual dipolar couplings (DNH) were acquired using the two-dimensional inphaseantiphase-HSQC sequence (18Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn.

DNH values were calculated as the difference between splittings measured in an aligned sample and those measured in the isotropic phase (RDCs were not corrected for the negative gyromagnetic ratio of 15N). RDCs observed under different conditions were normalized based on the size of the splitting of the deuterium signal (relative to RDCs for wt αS in buffer A). Familial Mutations Do Not Completely Unfold αS—Paramagnetic enhancement of nuclear spin relaxation by nitroxide spin labels is a useful technique for deriving distance restrains for unfolded states of proteins (21Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 3607-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). A nitroxide radical causes broadening of the NMR signals of nearby protons, an effect that extends as far as 20 Å from modified cysteine residues. As αS lacks cysteine, three different double mutants containing variable single Ala to Cys replacements were constructed for both the A30P and A53T mutant αS. Attachment of the spin label MTSL to residue 90 greatly attenuated NMR signals of amino acids in the C terminus of A30P mutant αS with peak intensity ratios between the paramagnetic and the diamagnetic states (Iparam/Idiam) in the range of 0.5 to 0.9 (Fig. 1B, panel II). This result indicates that the C-terminal domain of A30P αS is compact, as had been observed previously for wt αS (13Bertoncini C.W. Jung Y.S. Fernandez C.O. Hoyer W. Griesinger C. Jovin T.M. Zweckstetter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1430-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) and also holds for the A53T mutant (Fig. 1B, panel V). When the spin label was attached to residue 140 in the wt protein, the NMR signals of residues located in the NAC region were considerably broadened, providing support for a back-folding of the C terminus on this region in wt αS (13Bertoncini C.W. Jung Y.S. Fernandez C.O. Hoyer W. Griesinger C. Jovin T.M. Zweckstetter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1430-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). There was no evidence for such a long range interaction in either the A30P or the A53T mutants (Fig. 1B, panels III and VI). In the A18C spin-labeled mutant αS, intensity ratios as low as 0.5 were observed in the C terminus, similar to those of wt αS (13Bertoncini C.W. Jung Y.S. Fernandez C.O. Hoyer W. Griesinger C. Jovin T.M. Zweckstetter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1430-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). In contrast, the relaxation enhancement of residues 40–60 was decreased by about 20% for both missense mutants compared with the wt protein (Fig. 1B, panels I and IV). The reduced paramagnetic broadening of residues 40–60 suggests that the compaction of the N-terminal region is reduced in mutant αS, in agreement with recent tryptophan fluorescence energy transfer measurements (22Lee J.C. Langen R. Hummel P.A. Gray H.B. Winkler J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16466-16471Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Parkinsonism-linked Mutations Greatly Perturb Specific Tertiary Interactions Essential for the Native State of αS—Residual dipolar couplings are exquisitely sensitive to bond vector orientation and can be measured in a weakly aligned protein, for which the large internuclear dipolar interactions no longer average to zero (23Bax A. Grzesiek S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 131-138Crossref Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that RDCs identify five different domains in wt αS (domain I, residues 1–28; domain II, residues 33–65; domain III, residues 70–88; domain IV, residues 95–105; and domain V, the C terminus) and probe a hydrophobic core comprising the C terminus and domain III and IV (13Bertoncini C.W. Jung Y.S. Fernandez C.O. Hoyer W. Griesinger C. Jovin T.M. Zweckstetter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1430-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). RDCs in PD-linked mutant αS were observed with the A30P and A53T αS mutants dissolved in a dilute liquid crystalline phase of 5% C8E5/octanol. No significant differences in the chemical shifts of spectra in C8E5/octanol and free in solution were observed, suggesting that the anisotropic phase did not appreciably perturb the ensemble of αS conformations. The RDCs in A30P and A53T mutant αS were predominantly positive, with regions displaying relatively large RDCs separated by residues with RDCs close to zero (Fig. 2, A and B). Slightly negative couplings were observed for some residues. The mutant dipolar couplings correlate well with the RDC domain pattern of the wt protein. In contrast to wt αS, however, the RDCs for domain II (residues 50–62) and domain III (residues 70–94) were strongly reduced. Moreover, residues 20–44 displayed much smaller RDCs in the A30P mutant than in both wt and A53T mutant αS, likely due to the missense mutation in this region. In the C-terminal domain, the magnitudes of RDCs were comparable with those in the rest of the protein, in contrast to the RDC profile of wt αS, in which the effect was higher by ∼ 100%. The dipolar couplings of A30P αS were similar to those of wt αS in the presence of 8 m urea (Fig. 2C), whereas the magnitude of RDCs of A53T αS was comparable with that of wt αS in the presence of 4 m urea (Fig. 2D). In addition, the RDC profile of A18C αS, a non-amyloidogenic mutant of αS with an unaltered time course of aggregation (data not shown), was nearly identical to that of wt αS (supplemental Fig. S1). The results presented in Fig. 2 were reproduced in a second alignment medium and at 37 °C (supplemental Fig. S2). We previously showed that polyamine binding induces a complete unfolding of wt αS. In the A30P and A53T mutants, however, the strong paramagnetic broadening exerted by a spin label attached to either residue 18 or 90 on the C-terminal domain (Fig. 1B, panels I, II, IV, and V) indicate that long range interactions are not completely abolished. This interpretation is compatible with measurements of the radius of gyration, which did not differ significantly between wt and mutant αS, but were smaller than for wt αS in 8 m urea (24Li J. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Neurotoxicology. 2002; 23: 553-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 25Morar A.S. Olteanu A. Young G.B. Pielak G.J. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2195-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Moreover, 15N relaxation time measurements did not indicate any major long range effects of A30P and A53T replacements on the backbone flexibility of αS (26Bussell Jr., R. Eliezer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45996-46003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Residual dipolar couplings, as reported in this study, were considerably reduced in the vicinity of both missense mutations. For the A30P mutation, the increased flexibility is in agreement with the reduced heteronuclear15N R ρ1 relaxation rates of backbone amide groups and a reduced helical propensity for residues 18–31 (26Bussell Jr., R. Eliezer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45996-46003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Besides these local changes, however, a very strong reduction of dipolar couplings in the C-terminal domain of αS was observed (Fig. 2). As only RDCs and not 15N relaxation time measurements are sensitive to motions from nano- to microseconds, this suggests that the PD-linked mutations strongly increase structural fluctuations on this time scale, one in which secondary structures form during protein folding (27Kubelka J. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 76-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Additional long range effects were observed for the hydrophobic NAC region, in which the magnitude of RDCs was considerably decreased (Figs. 2, A and B) and in which no paramagnetic broadening was detected by a spin label attached to residue 140 (Fig. 1B, panels III and VI). These results point toward a reduced shielding of the hydrophobic NAC region in the A30P and A53T mutant αS. In summary, the dipolar couplings demonstrate that the intricate network of long-range interactions is perturbed in PD-linked mutant αS. The protein is more flexible and able to sample a large range of conformations. Thus, both A30P and A53T mutant αS can overcome more easily the energetic barrier for self-association, leading to an increased tendency to oligomerize (7Conway K.A. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Ding T.T. Williamson R.E. Lansbury P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). Formation of mature fibrils, on the other hand, requires an incorporation of the N terminus in a β-sheet structure, a process hindered by the presence of proline and thus potentially accounting for a slower rate of fibril formation by the A30P αS mutant (7Conway K.A. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Ding T.T. Williamson R.E. Lansbury P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). αS Gradually Loses Its Native Conformation—RDCs and PREs probe different structural features of αS. Backbone RDCs report on local, backbone conformational propensities (such as transient elements of secondary structure) in unfolded states of proteins (28Mohana-Borges R. Goto N.K. Kroon G.J.A. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1131-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), whereas PREs are sensitive to average, long range intramolecular distances (21Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 3607-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Therefore, NMR dipolar couplings and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement by nearby spin labels correspond to two other techniques commonly used to characterize unfolding of proteins: far-ultraviolet CD to monitor secondary structure content, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer to evaluate intramolecular distances. Although differential scanning calorimetry did not reveal any thermal transition for either wt or mutant αSinthe range 15–110 °C (29Syme C.D. Blanch E.W. Holt C. Jakes R. Goedert M. Hecht L. Barron L.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), backbone RDCs in the C terminus of αS were greatly reduced upon heating to 37 °C (13Bertoncini C.W. Jung Y.S. Fernandez C.O. Hoyer W. Griesinger C. Jovin T.M. Zweckstetter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1430-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) or by the introduction of missense mutations (Fig. 2). As the sites of mutation are far from the C terminus, the detrimental effects of the mutations must be transmitted through the network of transient long range interactions to the C-terminal domain of αS, such that conformational restrictions of the backbone are reduced. However, the retention of strong PRE broadening at 37 °C or in the presence of missense mutations indicates that dipolar couplings and PREs have different thermal transition midpoints. Redistribution of the Ensemble of αS Conformers May Underlie Toxic Gain-of-Function—Several biological and biochemical properties underlying the toxic gain-of-function of the familial mutants of αS can now be rationalized in terms of the different intrinsic structural features of these proteins (Table I). Recently, it was shown that C-terminal truncation of αS is a normal cellular process and that the generation and accumulation of truncated αS may be involved in the initiation and progression of αS aggregation in vivo. Residues 119–123 were identified as potential cleavage sites and the accumulation of truncated αS was enhanced by the expression of mutant αS (30Li W. West N. Colla E. Pletnikova O. Troncoso J.C. Marsh L. Dawson T.M. Jäkälä P. Hartmann T. Price D.L. Lee K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2162-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). These findings may be explained by the results of the present study. Although the truncation site is far from the A30P and A53T missense mutations, the destabilization of αS tertiary structure may allow proteases to degrade the αS C terminus more efficiently. This destabilization may also be the source for the increased affinity of lysosomal chaperone-mediated autophagy receptors for mutant αS, recognizing the sequence 95VKKDQ99 present in the C terminus of αS and thereby causing an impairment in protein catabolism (6Cuervo A.M. Stefanis L. Fredenburg R. Lansbury P.T. Sulzer D. Science. 2004; 305: 1292-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). Regarding self-association, an increased tendency to form dimers, oligomers, and annular protofibrills has been evidenced for both PD-linked mutants (7Conway K.A. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Ding T.T.

Lansbury Jr., P.T. Nature. 2002; 418: 291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar), which may as well be explained in terms of our findings. The decreased shielding of the highly hydrophobic NAC region due to the reduction of long range interactions allows A30P and A53T mutant αS to preferentially expose this region to the solvent, facilitating self-association.Table IDistinctive features of αS-mediated pathogenesis correlate with the properties of A30P and A53T mutantsCharacteristics associated with the increased neurotoxicity of A30P and A53TBiological featuresReduced cell viability in cell culture models (33Dev K.K.

This effect may account for the toxic gain-of-function of familial Parkinsonism-linked mutant αS. Conformationally altered αS may constitute a general molecular mechanism underlying the induction of PD by environmental and genetic conditions (Fig. 3). Thus, agents specifically designed to stabilize the native state of αS may prove useful in impeding or reversing its pathologic aggregation in both idiopathic and familial forms of Parkinson disease.

With use of the large calyx of Held presynaptic terminal from rats, we found that cleavage of different SNARE proteins by clostridial neurotoxins caused distinct kinetic changes in neurotransmitter release. When elevating calcium ion concentration directly at the presynaptic terminal with the use of caged calcium, cleavage of SNAP-25 by botulinum toxin A (BoNT/A) produced a strong reduction in the calcium sensitivity for release, whereas cleavage of syntaxin using BoNT/C1 and synaptobrevin using tetanus toxin (TeNT) produced an all-or-nothing block without changing the kinetics of remaining vesicles. When stimulating release by calcium influx through channels, a difference between BoNT/C1 and TeNT emerged, which suggests that cleavage of synaptobrevin modifies the coupling between channels and release-competent vesicles."

However, their oxidation in vivo by acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs) that catalyze the first step of each cycle of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation is not entirely understood. Recently, a novel ACAD (ACAD-9) of unknown function that is highly homologous to human very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was identified by large-scale random sequencing. To characterize its enzymatic role, we have expressed ACAD-9 in Escherichia coli, purified it, and determined its pattern of substrate utilization. The N terminus of the mature form of the enzyme was identified by in vitro mitochondrial import studies of precursor protein. A 37-amino acid leader peptide was cleaved sequentially by two mitochondrial peptidases to yield a predicted molecular mass of 65 kDa for the mature subunit. Submitochondrial fractionation studies found native ACAD-9 to be associated with the mitochondrial membrane. Gel filtration analysis indicated that, like very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, ACAD-9 is a dimer, in contrast to the other known ACADs, which are tetramers. Purified mature ACAD-9 had maximal activity with long-chain unsaturated acyl-CoAs as substrates (C16:1-, C18:1-, C18:2-, C22:6-CoA).

Unsaturated fatty acids are the most abundant form of stored fat in the human body and are vital for all living organisms. In addition to their role as an energy source, they are integral constituents of cell membranes, playing a role in membrane fluidity, cell signaling, and membrane integrity (1Benatti P. Peluso G. Nicolai R. Calvani M. J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 2004; 23: 281-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar).

Recently, a new ACAD (ACAD-9) that is highly homologous to human VLCAD was identified by large-scale random sequencing (13Zhang J. Zhang W. Zou D. Chen G. Wan T. Zhang M. Cao X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 1033-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The objective of this study was to investigate the function of ACAD-9. In this work, we describe the import and processing of the ACAD-9 precursor into mitochondria in vitro and in eukaryotic cells. We characterize the enzymatic properties of purified ACAD-9 following expression in Escherichia coli and purification. Surprisingly, purified ACAD-9 shows maximal activity toward long-chain unsaturated substrates, suggesting a novel role in mitochondrial β-oxidation. In Vitro Transcription and Translation of the ACAD-9 Precursor, Mitochondrial Import and Processing, and N-terminal Radiosequencing—First-strand cDNA was synthesized from fibroblast mRNA with the iScript kit (Bio-Rad) and used as template for PCR amplification of the ACAD-9 precursor sequence. The PCR product was cloned into the pGEM-T-Easy vector (Promega) using TA cloning according to the manufacturer's instructions and then subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). The identity of this and all other constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. ACAD-9 precursor protein was synthesized from 1 μg of pcDNA3.1(+) containing the ACAD-9 precursor cDNA by coupled in vitro transcription/translation in the presence of l-[4,5-3H]leucine (25 μCi, 160 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) or [35S]methionine (20 μCi, ∼1250 Ci/mmol) as described (14Vockley J. Nagao M. Parimoo B. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2494-2501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cavadini P. Gakh O. Isaya G. Methods. 2002; 26: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For import assays, liver mitochondria were freshly prepared from young male Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (14Vockley J. Nagao M. Parimoo B. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2494-2501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mohsen A.-W. Anderson B.D. Volchenboum S.L. Battaile K.P. Tiffany K. Roberts D. Kim J.-J.P. Vockley J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10325-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The final pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 220 mm d-mannitol, and 70 mm sucrose (HMS buffer) and diluted to a final concentration of 20 mg/ml protein (14Vockley J. Nagao M. Parimoo B. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2494-2501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thirty-five μl of translation mixture containing translated 3H- or 35S-labeled precursor were mixed with 85 μl of mitochondrial suspension and 30 μl of HMS buffer to a total volume of 150 μl and incubated at 30 °C for 75 min. The incubation mixture was then separated into supernatant and mitochondrial pellet fractions by centrifugation at 9100 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The pellets were solubilized in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiled for 10 min. For processing with yeast mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP; EC 3.4.24.64), 15 μlof 3H- or 35S-labeled translation mixture were incubated with 100 ng of purified recombinant yeast MPP prepared as described (15Cavadini P. Gakh O. Isaya G. Methods. 2002; 26: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) in a total reaction volume of 60 μl of 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm MnCl2 for 30 min at 30 °C (15Cavadini P. Gakh O. Isaya G. Methods. 2002; 26: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Three μlofa[35S]methionine-labeled import reaction mixture were added to each of two [3H]leucine-labeled import reactions, and these reactions were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE utilizing piperazine diacrylamide (Bio-Rad) instead of bisacrylamide as cross-linker to prevent possible N-terminal modification (17Hochstrasser D.F. Patchornik A. Merril C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Three 3H-labeled reactions incubated with purified yeast MPP were pooled, 12 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled MPP reaction mixture were added, and the sample was loaded onto the same gel. Additionally, 1 μl of translated precursor was loaded onto a separate lane. Heat-inactivated mitochondria were added to the MPP reaction sample to equalize the amount of protein loaded onto the gel. Separated processed products were then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Schleicher & Schüll, London, UK) and visualized by autoradiography. The bands corresponding to processed products were excised from the membrane and subjected to N-terminal radiosequencing with an Applied Biosystems 494cLC protein sequencer (performed in the Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University, New Haven, CT). 3H released with each cycle of sequencing was quantitated by scintillation counting. Expression and Cellular Localization of ACAD-9 in Mammalian Cells—PCR mutagenesis was used to replace the endogenous stop codon of the ACAD-9 precursor previously cloned into pGEM-T-Easy with a glycine codon (GGA) and to introduce XbaI and NdeI restriction sites into the 3′-end of the ACAD-9 coding region. Purified PCR products were ligated into the pCR-Blunt-II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen); a HindIII/NdeI fragment was purified and ligated into the pGEM-T-Easy-ACAD-9 vector; and the altered ACAD-9 cDNA was subcloned as a NotI/XbaI fragment into the expression plasmid pcDNA3/Myc-HisB (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid, pcDNA3/ACAD-9-Myc-HisB, was then transfected into Chang cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) utilizing FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics), and cellular localization was assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica TCS 4D microscope) as described (18Corydon T.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 232: 183-202PubMed Google Scholar, 19Corydon T.J. Bross P. Jensen T.G. Corydon M.J. Lund T.B. Jensen U.B. Kim J.-J.P. Gregersen N. Bolund L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13065-13071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In brief, 48 h post-transfection, Chang cells were incubated with 50 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos dye (Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 30 min at 37 °C and fixed in normal buffered formalin (Mallinckrodt Baker Inc.) for 15 min at room temperature. Anti-Myc monoclonal antibody raised against the c-Myc tag (9E10, Research Diagnostics Inc.) was used as the primary antibody, and fluorescein-conjugated Alexa Fluor-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was used as the secondary antibody. Nuclear DNA was counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (1 μg/ml), and slide flasks were mounted using antifade solution (18Corydon T.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 232: 183-202PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide Mass Mapping by Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry—Approximately 2.4 × 107 human embryonic kidney 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) transfected with pcDNA3/ACAD-9-Myc-HisB were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and cell pellets were dissolved in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl (pH 8), and 14 mm α-mercaptoethanol. ACAD-9-Myc-His fusion protein was purified on an Ni2+ HiTrap chelating HP column (1-ml volume, 2.5-cm column length, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions; separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE; and stained with Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad). Gel slices containing ACAD-9 were digested with either modified Pseudomonas fragi endoproteinase Asp-N (Roche Diagnostics) or trypsin (Promega) and processed as described (20Gobom J. Nordhoff E. Mirgorodskaya E. Ekman R. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry was carried out using a Bruker Daltonics Autoflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer with a scoutMTP ion source operating in reflector mode. Spectra were analyzed using FlexAnalysis Version 2.0 and BioTools Version 2.2 (both from Bruker Daltonics). Expression in E. coli and Purification of Mature ACAD-9—The sequence of mature human ACAD-9 was inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-21a(+) (Novagen). PCR primers were designed to amplify the mature coding region of the human ACAD-9 precursor sequence previously cloned into the pGEM-T-Easy vector. The 5′-primer consisted of 94 nucleotides and included an NdeI restriction site (shown in boldface), followed by the first 81 nucleotides of the mature ACAD-9 coding sequence; the first 60 nucleotides of the coding sequence were altered to reflect E. coli codon usage bias (21de Boer H.A. Kastelein R.A. Reznikoff W. Gold L. Maximizing Gene Expression. Butterworth-Heinemann, Stoneham, MA1986: 225-285Crossref Google Scholar, 22Mohsen A.-W. Vockley J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar): 5′-A GTA CGT CAT ATG GCT TTC GCT AAA GAA CTG TTC CTG GGC AAA ATC AAA AAA AAA GAA GTT TTC CCG TTC CCG GAA GTT AGC CAA GAT GAA CTT-3′. The 3′-primer consisted of the last 26 nucleotides of the coding region (stop codon in antisense direction shown in italics), followed by an EcoRI restriction site (shown in boldface): 5′-ATT CGA GAA TTC TCA GCA GGT GCG GTC CAG AGG GTG GG-3′ (with nucleotides altered to conform to E. coli codon usage bias underlined). The amplified fragment was subcloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of the pET-21a(+) vector. The pET-21a(+) vector, which expresses the mature ACAD-9 insert without a tag, was transformed into the E. coli host strain C43 (DE3) (Avidis, Saint Beauzire, France) (23Arechaga I. Miroux B. Karrasch S. Huijbregts R. de Kruijff B. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and the enzyme was then purified from a cell-free extract as described previously (16Mohsen A.-W. Anderson B.D. Volchenboum S.L. Battaile K.P. Tiffany K. Roberts D. Kim J.-J.P. Vockley J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10325-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Mohsen A.-W. Vockley J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, an 8-liter culture of cells grown to mid-log phase (absorbance of 0.8–1.0 at 550 nm) at 37 °C was induced overnight at 37 °C by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) (22Mohsen A.-W. Vockley J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and lysed using a French press (two passes of pelleted cells at a pressure of 10,000 p.s.i. following treatment with DNase), and the lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min. ACAD-9 was purified from the supernatant by fast protein liquid chromatography. Approximately 50 ml of cell-free extract were loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose fast flow column (Amersham Biosciences), and the bound protein was eluted using a 0–300 mm NaCl gradient in 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0). Fractions with a yellow-green color were tested for enzyme activity, and peak fractions were combined and loaded onto a 20-μm ceramic hydroxylapatite column (Bio-Rad). The column was eluted with a 0 – 0.5 mm potassium phosphate gradient at pH 6.8. Peak samples were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration, and the final sample was stored in buffer containing 20% glycerol at –80 °C until used. The molecular mass of purified recombinant ACAD-9 protein was estimated by gel filtration analysis using a BioSep SEC-S3000 column in a Waters HPLC system. The column was calibrated using standards purchased from Amersham Biosciences: ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and ferritin (440 kDa). Production of Anti-ACAD-9 Antiserum—Rabbit antiserum to purified ACAD-9 was raised by Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. (Reamstown, PA) according to standard company protocols. Rabbits were given an initial inoculation of 200 μg of purified protein and boosted four times with 200 μg of purified protein each at 1- or 2-week intervals. Reactivity of the final serum was confirmed by Western blotting. Enzyme Assays and Kinetic Analysis—Hexanoyl (C6:0)-CoA, octanoyl (C8:0)-CoA, nonanoyl (C9:0)-CoA, decanoyl (C10:0)-CoA, undecanoyl (C11:0)-CoA, lauroyl (C12:0)-CoA, myristoyl (C14:0)-CoA, myristoleoyl (cis-9-C14:1)-CoA, pentadecanoyl (C15:0)-CoA, palmitoyl (C16: 0)-CoA, palmitoleoyl (cis-9-C16:1)-CoA, heptadecanoyl (C17:0)-CoA, stearoyl (C18:0)-CoA, oleoyl (cis-9-C18:1)-CoA, elaidoyl (trans-9-C18:1)-CoA, linoleoyl (cis-9,cis-12-C18:2)-CoA, and arachidoyl (C20:0)-CoA were purchased from Sigma. Arachidonoyl (all-cis-5,8,11,14-C20:4)-CoA, icosapentaenoyl (all-cis-5,8,11,14,17-C20:5)-CoA, docosahexaenoyl (all-cis-4,7,10,13,16,19-C22:6)-CoA, and docosanoyl (C22:0)-CoA were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The branched-chain substrates 2,6-dimethylheptanoyl (C7:0)-CoA and 4,8,12-trimethyltridecanoyl (C13:0)-CoA were kindly provided by Dr. R. J. A. Wanders (Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and Dr. P. P. van Veldhoven (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium), respectively. ACAD-9 activity was measured with the anaerobic electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) reduction assay using an LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with a heated cuvette block set to 32 °C as described (24Frerman F.E. Goodman S.I. Biochem. Med. 1985; 33: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 25Vockley J. Mohsen A.-W. Binzak B. Willard J.-M. Fauq A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 241-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The final substrate concentration in the assay mixtures was 50 μm. For kinetic analysis, the ETF concentration was 1 μm, and the substrate concentration was varied from 0.1 to 45 μm. Km and Vmax values were calculated using SigmaPlot software (Systat Software, Inc., Point Richmond, CA), with fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression analysis. Mitochondrial Fractionation—Human muscle (100 mg) in 600 μlof 200 mm Tris (pH 8.0) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) was homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer for 10–15 s. The resulting supernatant was sonicated on ice three times for 10 s each and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant containing mitochondrial matrix proteins was saved for analysis. The pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of 200 mm Tris (pH 8.0) by brief sonication, and then 30 μl of 2.5% Lubrol (polyethylene glycol ether W-1, Sigma) were added. After incubation for 15 min on ice, the sample was subjected to centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant contained mitochondrial integral and membrane-associated proteins. Fifty μg each of muscle mitochondrial membrane and matrix fractions were separated on a 12% Bistris/SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad) along with 10 ng of purified ACAD-9, VLCAD, or MCAD and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were subjected to Western blotting using rabbit polyclonal antibody against ACAD-9, VLCAD (kindly provided by Dr. A. W. Strauss, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN), or MCAD, respectively. Molecular Modeling—A prediction of the three-dimensional structure of ACAD-9 (minus the C-terminal region that is not found in the published structures of ACADs) was obtained using Insight II 2000 software with the Homology package (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) on a Silicon Graphics O2 workstation. Modeling based on the published structure of porcine MCAD with bound C8:0-CoA substrate (Protein Data Bank code 3MDE) (26Kim J.-J.P. Wang M. Paschke R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7523-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) was carried out using the Homology and Modeler modules as described previously (25Vockley J. Mohsen A.-W. Binzak B. Willard J.-M. Fauq A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 241-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The final working model, essentially void of violations, had a tertiary fold similar to that of MCAD and other published ACAD crystal structures (26Kim J.-J.P. Wang M. Paschke R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7523-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 27Lee H.J. Wang M. Paschke R. Nandy A. Ghisla S. Kim J.-J.P.

An ETF ACAD-9 complex was also modeled using the published ETF MCAD complex atomic coordinates (Protein Data Bank code 1T9G) (32Toogood H.S. van Thiel A. Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Leys D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32904-32912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) to further confirm the validity of our ACAD-9 model and to examine the structure of the ACAD-9 ETF-docking site. Identification of the Mature N Terminus of ACAD-9—Radiolabeled ACAD-9 precursor protein was synthesized by coupled transcription/translation. Analysis by SDS-PAGE revealed a band for the translated ACAD-9 precursor with an apparent molecular mass of ∼70 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 1). It was processed to a smaller mature intramitochondrial form when incubated with freshly isolated rat liver mitochondria (Fig. 1A, lane 3). When incubated with purified yeast MPP, however, the precursor was cleaved to mature product that appeared to be slightly larger (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Cleavage of the N-terminal amino acid of ACAD-9 by MPP was deduced by radiosequencing to be between precursor residues 29 and 30 (RRL↓LRT) (Fig. 1B). This pattern matched the characterized recognition site of MPP (RX↓) that typically cleaves two peptide bonds after an arginine residue (34Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, sequencing of the mitochondrially imported precursor indicated release of [3H]leucine in cycles 6 and 8, consistent with cleavage between residues 37 and 38 (PVR↓AFA) (Fig. 1C). The difference of 8 amino acids between the two processed products, intermediate ACAD-9 and mature ACAD-9, represents an octapeptide that follows the motif XRX↓(F/L/I)XX(T/S/G)XXXX↓ (R-10 motif), the characterized recognition site for mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP; EC 3.4.24.59) cleavage (Fig. 1D) (35Isaya G. Kalousek F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 556-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36Gakh O. Cavadini P. Isaya G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). These results indicate that ACAD-9 undergoes two-step mitochondrial processing, resulting in cleavage of 37 amino acids from the precursor protein and leaving Ala38 of the precursor protein as the N-terminal amino acid of the mature form of the enzyme. Intramitochondrial Localization, Purification, and Peptide Mass Mapping of ACAD-9 in Mammalian Cells—To confirm the localization of ACAD-9 to the mitochondria in intact eukaryotic cells, a plasmid expressing an ACAD-9-Myc-His fusion protein was used to transfect eukaryotic Chang cells. A discrete pattern of fluorescence co-localizing with the mitochondrion-specific MitoTracker dye was observed after anti-Myc staining and was similar to that obtained for human SCAD (Fig. 2) (19Corydon T.J. Bross P. Jensen T.G. Corydon M.J. Lund T.B. Jensen U.B. Kim J.-J.P. Gregersen N. Bolund L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13065-13071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This indicates that the fusion protein was localized inside the mitochondria. This was confirmed by direct immunofluorescence of native ACAD-9 in fibroblast monolayers with anti-ACAD-9 antiserum (data not shown). To identify the mature N terminus of the ACAD-9-Myc-His fusion protein, the tagged protein was affinity-purified from extracts of transfected human embryonic kidney cells and separated by SDS-PAGE. The ACAD-9-Myc-His band was excised from the gel and in-gel digested with trypsin (cleavage of peptide bonds C-terminal to Arg and Lys) or endoproteinase Asp-N (cleavage of peptide bonds N-terminal to Asp), and the resulting peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. A total of 42 tryptic peptides were unambiguously assigned to the ACAD-9 sequence, corresponding to a sequence coverage of 62.6%, with the most N-terminal cleavage site predicted to be between Lys51 and Glu52 (supplemental Table 1). After partial digestion with trypsin, masses matching both peptides 38AFAKELFLGK47 and 38AFAKELFLGKIKKK51 were identified (data not shown). Mass analysis of peptides resulting from endoproteinase Asp-N digestion of ACAD-9 identified the first Asp-N cleavage site in ACAD-9 to be localized between Gln61 and Asp62 (supplemental Table 2). Eleven peptide masses were assigned to the human ACAD-9 sequence (supplemental Table 2). In addition, a mass was detected matching sequence 38AFAKELFLGKIKKKEVFPFPEVSQ61 (observed mass of 2780.52 Da; calculated mass of 2780.58 Da) that did not correspond to any of the 11 peptides, identifying Ala38 as the N-terminal amino acid of the mature ACAD-9 protein within the mitochondria (supplemental Fig. 1). E. coli Expression, Purification, and Molecular Mass of ACAD-9—Following cloning into a prokaryotic expression vector, mature ACAD-9 was expressed in E. coli and purified. The specific activity of the crude extract was 65 milliunits/mg of protein, whereas that of the final purified sample was 780 milliunits/mg of protein. Greater than 5 mg of ACAD-9 were generally obtained per liter of induced cells. The recombinant ACAD-9 protein was ∼95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). The calculated molecular mass of mature ACAD-9 was 64.8 kDa, in agreement with the apparent subunit size of the purified protein. Purified native ACAD-9 eluted at a volume corresponding to an apparent native mass of 119 kDa on a BioSep SEC-S3000 HPLC gel filtration column, indicating that native ACAD-9 is dimeric (Fig. 3).

https://openalex.org/W2153189178,"Our previous studies have documented MAPK mediation of the hypertonicity-induced stimulation of COX-2 expression in cultured renal medullary epithelial cells (Yang, T., Huang, Y., Heasley, L. E., Berl, T., Schnermann, J. B., and Briggs, J. P. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 23281-23286). The present study extends this observation by examining the role of reactive oxygen species (ROSs). ROS levels, determined using dichlorodihydrofluorescence diacetate and cytochrome c, were rapidly and significantly increased following exposure of mIMCD-K2 cells to media made hypertonic by adding NaCl. Hypertonic treatment (550 mosmol/kg) for 16 h induced a 5.6-fold increase in COX-2 protein levels and comparable increases in prostaglandin E2 release, both of which were completely abolished by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (25-50 μm). The general antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (6 mm), and the superoxide dismutase mimetic TEMPO (2.0 mm) reduced COX-2 levels by 75.6 and 79.8%, respectively. Exposure of mIMCD-K2 cells to exogenous O2⋅¯ generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system mimicked the effect of hypertonicity on COX-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 release. The increases in phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 were detected 20 min following the hypertonic treatment and were both prevented by N-acetyl-l-cysteine. The increases in ROSs in response to hypertonic treatment were completely blocked by any one of the mitochondrial inhibitors tested, such as rotenone, thenoyltrifluoroacetone, or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, associated with remarkable inhibition of COX-2 expression. In contrast, the increases in ROSs were not significantly altered in IMCD cells deficient in either gp91phox or p47phox, nor were the increases in COX-2 expression. We conclude that ROSs derived from mitochondria, but not NADPH oxidase, mediate the hypertonicity-induced phosphorylation of MAPK and the stimulation of COX-2 expression. Our previous studies have documented MAPK mediation of the hypertonicity-induced stimulation of COX-2 expression in cultured renal medullary epithelial cells (Yang, T., Huang, Y., Heasley, L.

Exposure of mIMCD-K2 cells to exogenous O2⋅¯ generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system mimicked the effect of hypertonicity on COX-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 release. The increases in phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 were detected 20 min following the hypertonic treatment and were both prevented by N-acetyl-l-cysteine. The increases in ROSs in response to hypertonic treatment were completely blocked by any one of the mitochondrial inhibitors tested, such as rotenone, thenoyltrifluoroacetone, or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, associated with remarkable inhibition of COX-2 expression. In contrast, the increases in ROSs were not significantly altered in IMCD cells deficient in either gp91phox or p47phox, nor were the increases in COX-2 expression. We conclude that ROSs derived from mitochondria, but not NADPH oxidase, mediate the hypertonicity-induced phosphorylation of MAPK and the stimulation of COX-2 expression. In mammals, the renal medulla is one of the few tissues that is constantly exposed to hypertonicity. Furthermore, urinary osmolality in rodents increases to levels >3000 mosmol/kg following water deprivation. Survival of renal medullary cells in this hypertonic environment depends on the accumulation of compatible organic osmolytes (1Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F983-F996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kultz D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). This is accomplished by activation of a cluster of osmolyte-related genes, including aldose reductase and the transporters for betaine, taurine, and myo-inositol. Most of these genes are under the control of the tonicity-responsive enhancer-binding protein transcription factor TonEBP/NFAT5, which interacts with the tonicity-responsive enhancer/osmotic response element (TonE/ORE) (3Woo S.K.

COX-1 is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, and its expression level does not appear to change significantly; it is implicated in the regulation of housekeeping functions such as platelet aggregation and cytoprotective function in the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, COX-2 is much more restricted in its expression to certain cell types, and its expression undergoes robust changes in response to growth factors and inflammatory stimuli. In addition to its role as an inducible generator of prostaglandin H in the inflammatory response, evidence is emerging to suggest that COX-2 also plays an important role in the regulation of physiological processes, including those in the kidney. Within the kidney, COX-2 is abundantly expressed in the inner medulla and is further induced by water restriction (9Yang T. Schnermann J.B. Briggs J.P. Am. J.

COX-2 activity is required for osmolyte accumulation and adaptation to hypertonic stress (14Moeckel G.W. Zhang L. Fogo A.B. Hao C.M. Pozzi A. Breyer M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19352-19357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Previous studies from this laboratory have identified multiple members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, namely ERK1/2, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), as factors mediating tonicity-induced induction of COX-2 in cultured renal medullary epithelial cells (12Yang T.

In these experiments, COX-2 induction by hypertonicity was partially inhibited by a blockade of each of these MAPKs and was completely blocked by simultaneous blockade of ERK1/2 and p38. The hypertonic induction of COX-2 expression in IMCD3 cells requires transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase (15Zhao H. Tian W. Tai C. Cohen D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F281-F288Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In cultured renal medullary interstitial cells, the COX-2 induction is dependent on NFκB (10Hao C.M. Yull F. Blackwell T. Komhoff M. Davis L.S. Breyer M.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).The present study was performed to further define the transduction pathway responsible for osmotic regulation of COX-2 expression. Reactive oxygen species (ROSs) which are highly reactive by carrying one or more unpaired electrons in the outer orbits, are typically generated as a byproduct of oxygen metabolism. Large amounts of ROSs produced in phagocytes serve to kill invading microorganisms, whereas small amounts of ROSs produced in non-phagocytic tissues participate in signaling pathways. Increased formation of ROSs occurs when cells receive stress signaling. Because some of the best known targets of ROSs include MAPK as well as NFκB (16Kultz D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 225-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), we examined whether ROSs participate in the mediation of the hypertonic induction of COX-2 expression via MAPK in cultured renal medullary epithelial cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—The gp91phox null mutant mice were a gift from Mary C. Dinauer (University of Indiana) (17Pollock J.D. Williams D.A. Gifford M.A. Li L.L. Du X. Fisherman J. Orkin S.H. Doerschuk C.M. Dinauer M.C. Nat.

Holland S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar).Materials—Cell culture media and serum were from Invitrogen. PD-98059 and SB-203580 were from New England Biolabs and Upstate Biotechnology, respectively. Cytochrome c, SOD, genistein, TEMPO, xanthine, xanthine oxidase, rotenone (ROT), carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), and indomethacin were from Sigma. The murine COX-2 polyclonal antibody and the PGE2 enzyme immunoassay kit were from Cayman Chemical. Polyclonal antibodies against phosphorylated p44/42 and phosphorylated p38 were from Cell Signaling Technology.Cell Culture—mIMCD-K2 is an established mouse inner medullary collecting duct cell line provided by Dr. Bruce Stanton (14Moeckel G.W. Zhang L. Fogo A.B. Hao C.M. Pozzi A. Breyer M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19352-19357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The cells were routinely propagated in an Opti medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Primary cultures of kidney inner medullary cells were generated with modifications of previously described protocols (19Yang T. Terada Y. Nonoguchi H. Ujiie K. Tomita K. Marumo F. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F684-F689PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, mice were anesthetized by ketamine/xylazine, and kidneys were quickly removed under sterile conditions. The renal inner medulla was dissected, minced, and digested for 45 min in 10 ml of medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12, 1:1) (v/v) containing 0.2% collagenase and 0.2% hyaluronidase (w/v) at 37 °C with a stirrer. After incubation, 20 ml of distilled water was added to lyse cells other than collecting duct cells by osmotic shock (100 mosmol/kg). Cells were then centrifuged at 150 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in the modified DM medium (DMEM/Ham's F12, 1:1 (v/v), 50 nm hydrocortisone, 5 pm 3,3,5-triiodo-l-thyronine, 1 nm sodium selenate, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 5 mg/liter transferrin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 units/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v). Cells were kept in a 6-well plate for at least 10 days until confluence. At least 48 h before experiments, the medium of the incubating cells was replaced with a minimum medium that contained no drugs or hormones.2′,7′-Dichlorodihydrofluorescence Diacetate (DCFDA) Fluorescence Measurement of ROSs—The fluorogenic substrate 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) is a cell-permeable dye that is oxidized to highly fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) by H2O2 and can therefore be used to monitor intracellular generation of ROSs. For measurement of ROSs, cells were grown onto glass cover slides. When the cells reached confluence, they were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 30 min with 50 μm 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate diluted in Opti-minimum essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Then hypertonic medium was added. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were again washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and imaged by confocal laser microscopy. To quantitate ROS levels, cells were seeded to 96-well plate and treated as described above. Relative fluorescence was measured by a fluorescence plate reader (FLUOstar OPTIMA) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 528 nm, respectively, three times at 90-s intervals. Relative fluorescence units were expressed as fold increase over untreated cells.Cytochrome c Reduction-based Superoxide Assay—The extracellular superoxide production by hypertonicity-treated cells seeded in 24-well plates was determined from the SOD-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c (20Teufelhofer O. Weiss R.M. Parzefall W. Schulte-Hermann R. Micksche M. Berger W. Elbling L. Toxicol. Sci. 2003; 76: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Confluent cells were treated with isotonic or hypertonic medium (550 mosmol/kg by adding NaCl) in the presence or absence of 50 μm genistein. 160 μm cytochrome c was added to all wells, and 100 units/ml SOD was added to a second well for each sample. Absorbance was measured in a plate reader at 550 nm. Superoxide production was calculated from the difference in the absorbance in the absence and presence of SOD.Western Blotting for COX-2—mIMCD-K2 cells were lysed and subsequently sonicated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% TX-100, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol (pH 7.5). Protein concentration was determined by Coomassie reagent. 40 μg of protein from whole cell lysates was denatured in boiling water for 10 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked overnight with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline followed by incubation for 1 h with rabbit anti-murine polyclonal antiserum to COX-2 at a dilution of 1:1000. After washing with Tris-buffered saline, blots were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized with ECL kits (Amersham Biosciences).Phosphorylation of MAP Kinases—mIMCD-K2 cells grown in a 6-well plate were lysed by sonication for 10 s in 300 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 1.4% SDS, and 40 mm dithiothreitol (pH 6.8). The protein samples were heated at 60 °C for 15 min, and electrophoresis was performed as described above. The blots were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies against phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-p38 at a dilution of 1:1000. The secondary antibody and ECL reaction were the same as described above.COX-2 Promoter Activity Assay—2.7 kb of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse COX-2 gene was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. Transfection of mIMCD-K2 cells was performed using FuGENE6 according to the instruction from the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Luciferase activity was determined using a luminescence/fluorescence plate reader (FLUOstar OPTIMA).PGE2 Enzyme Immunoassay—PGE2 in the culture media was measured with an enzyme immunoassay kit. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 25 or 50 μl of the medium, along with a serial dilution of PGE2 standard samples, were mixed with appropriate amounts of acetylcholinesterase-labeled tracer and PGE2 antiserum and incubated at room temperature for 18 h. After the wells were emptied and rinsed with wash buffer, 200 μl of Ellman's reagent (5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)) containing a substrate for acetylcholinesterase was added.Statistical Analysis—Values shown represent means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance and Bonferroni tests with a p value of <0.05 being considered statistically significant.RESULTSEffect of Hypertonicity on ROSs—ROS levels in mIMCD-K2 cells exposed to isotonic or hypertonic medium were determined using dichlorodihydrofluorescence diacetate and cytochrome c. Osmolality in the medium was raised by adding NaCl. Exposure of the cells to hypertonicity markedly increased ROS levels as determined by the two independent methods (Figs. 1 and 2). The stimulation of ROSs was time-dependent, being detected at 2 min, gradually increasing with time, and peaking at 30 min following hypertonic treatment (Fig. 1, bottom). The increases in ROS levels were prevented by 50 μm genistein (Figs. 1 and 2).FIGURE 2Detection of hypertonicity induction of ROSs by the cytochrome c method. Confluent mIMCD-K2 cells in 24-well plates were treated with isotonic or hypertonic medium (550 mosmol/kg by adding NaCl) in the presence or absence of 50 μm genistein. 160 μm cytochrome c was added to all wells, and 100 units/ml SOD was added to a second well for each sample.

Shown are SOD-inhibitable absorbencies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Source of Increased ROSs in Response to Hypertonicity—Two potential sources of the ROSs, e.g. mitochondria and NADPH oxidase, were examined. A 30-min exposure of mIMCD-K2 cells to hypertonic medium induced a >2-fold increase in DCF fluorescence that was completely abolished by 5 μm rotenone, an inhibitor of complex I, 10 μm TTFA, an inhibitor of mitochondrial electron transport chain complex II, or 0.5 μm CCCP, an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). To examine NADPH oxidase as the source of the ROSs, DCF fluorescence was determined in cells derived from the renal inner medulla from gp91phox-/- and p47phox-/- and wild type control mice. The majority of cells exhibited epithelial cell-like morphology (data not shown) and were considered to be IMCD cells, although contamination of other cell types such as interstitial cells was inevitable. Hypertonic treatment induced an ∼2-fold increase in DCF fluorescence in primary cultures of both wild type and in mIMCD-K2 cells (Fig. 3B). However, the increases in DCF fluorescence were not significantly altered in gp91phox-/- or p47phox-/- cells as compared with wild type controls (wild type, 1.03 ± 0.04 versus 2.06 ± 0.12, p < 0.05; gp91phox-/- 1.14 ± 0.07 versus 1.81 ± 0.07, p < 0.05; p47-/-, 1.21 ± 0.07 versus 1.87 ± 0.04, p < 0.05; n = 8 in each group).FIGURE 3The contribution of mitochondria or NADPH oxidase to the hypertonicity-induced generation of ROSs.

To interfere with different steps in O2⋅¯ metabolism, four classes of antioxidants, namely mitochondrial inhibitors (ROT, CCCP, and TTFA), the NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI, the synthetic SOD mimetic TEMPO, and the general antioxidant NAC, were used. When mIMCD-K2 cells were exposed to media made hypertonic (550 mosmol/kg) by the addition of NaCl for 16 h, a >5-fold increase in COX-2 protein expression was noted that was remarkably inhibited or abolished by 5 μm ROT, 10 μm TTFA, 0.5 μm CCCP, or 25-50 μm DPI. NAC (6 mm) or TEMPO (2.0 mm) reduced COX-2 levels by 75.6 and 79.8%, respectively (Fig. 4). The inhibition of COX-2 expression was paralleled by complete blockade of hypertonicity-stimulated PGE2 release (Fig. 5).FIGURE 4Effects of antioxidants on hypertonicity-stimulated COX-2 expression in mIMCD-K2 Cells.

Hypertonic treatment for 16 h markedly induced COX-2 promoter activity that was abolished by 25 μm DPI and significantly inhibited by 3 mm NAC (Fig. 7). NAC and TEMPO were not toxic to the cells in the doses and durations used, whereas modest toxicity was noticed with 50 μm but not 25 μm DPI.FIGURE 7Effect of antioxidants on hypertonicity-induced COX-2 promoter activity. mIMCD-K2 cells were transiently transfected with the mouse COX-2 promoter-luciferase construct. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were treated for 16 h with hypertonic medium (550 mosmol/kg by adding NaCl) in the presence or absence of 25 μm DPI or 3 mm NAC.

COX-2 expression was not affected by xanthine alone but was markedly stimulated by xanthine plus xanthine oxidase (Fig. 8A). The expression of COX-2 correlated well with PGE2 levels (Fig. 8B).FIGURE 8Effect of xanthine/xanthine oxidase on COX-2 expression.

To rule out this possibility, we examined the effects of non-selective and selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents on COX-2 expression. As shown in Fig. 9, neither indomethacin nor SC-58635 caused significant changes of hypertonicity-induced COX-2 expression. Thus, it is unlikely that in our model system COX-2 expression is regulated in a feed-forward process by its own products.FIGURE 9Effects of non-selective and selective COX inhibitors on COX-2 expression. Confluent mIMCD-K2 cells were treated for 16 h with hypertonic medium (550 mosmol/kg by adding NaCl) in the presence or absence of 10 μm indomethacin or 10 μm SC-58635.

To test this hypothesis, we determined the effects of antioxidant treatment on the activation of MAPK by hypertonicity. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 was determined by immunoblotting using phosphorylation-specific antibodies. Exposure of mIMCD-K2 cells to hypertonicity for 20 min markedly increased the abundance of the phosphorylated forms of both ERK1/2 (p44/42) and p38. The activation of both ERK1/2 and p38 by hypertonicity was prevented by NAC (Fig. 10).FIGURE 10Effect of antioxidants on the hypertonicity activation of p44/42 and p38.

https://openalex.org/W2013123516,"Experimental evidence for human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) recombination was recently obtained in an individual with paternal inheritance of mtDNA1 and in an in vitro cell culture system2. Whether mtDNA recombination is a common event in humans remained to be determined. To detect mtDNA recombination in human skeletal muscle, we analyzed the distribution of alleles in individuals with multiple mtDNA heteroplasmy using single-cell PCR and allele-specific PCR. In all ten individuals who carried a heteroplasmic D-loop mutation and a distantly located tRNA point mutation or a large deletion, we observed a mixture of four allelic combinations (tetraplasmy), a hallmark of recombination. Twelve of 14 individuals with closely located heteroplasmic D-loop mutation pairs contained a mixture of only three types of mitochondrial genomes (triplasmy), consistent with the absence of recombination between adjacent markers. These findings indicate that mtDNA recombination is common in human skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2142783334,"A gene encoding a sterol ester-synthesizing enzyme was identified in Arabidopsis. The cDNA of the Arabidopsis gene At1g04010 (AtPSAT) was overexpressed in Arabidopsis behind the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Microsomal membranes from the leaves of overexpresser lines catalyzed the transacylation of acyl groups from phosphatidylethanolamine to sterols. This activity correlated with the expression level of the AtPSAT gene, thus demonstrating that this gene encodes a phospholipid:sterol acyltransferase (PSAT). Properties of the AtPSAT were examined in microsomal fractions from the tissues of an overexpresser. The enzyme did not utilize neutral lipids, had the highest activity with phosphatidylethanolamine, had a 5-fold preference for the sn-2 position, and utilized both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Various sterols and sterol intermediates, including triterpenic precursors, were acylated by the PSAT, whereas other triterpenes were not. Sterol selectivity studies showed that the enzyme is activated by end product sterols and that sterol intermediates are preferentially acylated by the activated enzyme. This indicates that PSAT both regulates the pool of free sterols as well as limits the amount of free sterol intermediates in the membranes. Two T-DNA insertion mutants in the AtPSAT gene, with strongly reduced (but still measurable) levels of sterol esters in their tissues, had no detectable PSAT activity in the microsomal fractions, suggesting that Arabidopsis possess other enzyme(s) capable of acylating sterols. The AtPSAT is the only intracellular enzyme found so far that catalyzes an acyl-CoA-independent sterol ester formation. Thus, PSAT has a similar physiological function in plant cells as the unrelated acyl-CoA:sterol acyltransferase has in animal cells. A gene encoding a sterol ester-synthesizing enzyme was identified in Arabidopsis. The cDNA of the Arabidopsis gene At1g04010 (AtPSAT) was overexpressed in Arabidopsis behind the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter.

This activity correlated with the expression level of the AtPSAT gene, thus demonstrating that this gene encodes a phospholipid:sterol acyltransferase (PSAT). Properties of the AtPSAT were examined in microsomal fractions from the tissues of an overexpresser. The enzyme did not utilize neutral lipids, had the highest activity with phosphatidylethanolamine, had a 5-fold preference for the sn-2 position, and utilized both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Various sterols and sterol intermediates, including triterpenic precursors, were acylated by the PSAT, whereas other triterpenes were not. Sterol selectivity studies showed that the enzyme is activated by end product sterols and that sterol intermediates are preferentially acylated by the activated enzyme. This indicates that PSAT both regulates the pool of free sterols as well as limits the amount of free sterol intermediates in the membranes. Two T-DNA insertion mutants in the AtPSAT gene, with strongly reduced (but still measurable) levels of sterol esters in their tissues, had no detectable PSAT activity in the microsomal fractions, suggesting that Arabidopsis possess other enzyme(s) capable of acylating sterols. The AtPSAT is the only intracellular enzyme found so far that catalyzes an acyl-CoA-independent sterol ester formation. Thus, PSAT has a similar physiological function in plant cells as the unrelated acyl-CoA:sterol acyltransferase has in animal cells. Sterols are components of all eukaryotic membranes and are important regulators of membrane fluidity and thus membrane properties and functions (1Demel R.A. De Kruyff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 457: 109-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 2Bloch K.E. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 14: 47-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Because acylated sterols or sterol esters (SE) 2The abbreviations used are: SE, sterol esters; PSAT, phospholipid:sterol acyltransferase; LCAT, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase; ACAT, acyl-CoA:sterol acyltransferase; PDAT, phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PA, phosphatidic acid; RPHPTLC, reversed phase high performance TLC; AtPSAT, A. thaliana phospholipid sterol acyltransferase; Wt, wild type. cannot participate in the bilayer of the membranes, the acylation of sterols is believed to play a crucial role in maintaining free sterol homeostasis in the cell membranes (3Lewis T.A.

In other words, sterol esters are generally thought to constitute a storage pool of sterols when those are present in amounts greater than immediately required for the cells. For instance, accumulation of sterol esters has been described during seed maturation, senescence, or when plant cell cultures reach stationary phase, as well as in a mutant line overproducing sterols (4Dyas L. Goad L.J. Phytochemistry. 1993; 34: 17-29Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although no plant gene involved in sterol esterification had been isolated yet, the animal and yeast counterparts have been well characterized. Two types of enzymes are responsible for the formation of SE in animals as follows: acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), which catalyzes an acyl-CoA-dependent acylation (7Chang T.Y. Chang C.C. Cheng D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), which catalyzes transacylation of acyl groups from phospholipids to sterols (8Jonas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). ACAT is membrane-bound and has sequence homologies to an acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase family described in animals and plants (9Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C. Welch C.B. Lusis A.J. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13018-13023Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 10Hobbs D.H. Hills M.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). LCAT, which is evolutionarily unrelated to ACAT, is a soluble enzyme present in the bloodstream and is an important regulator of blood cholesterol levels and thus has no role in maintaining sterol homeostasis within the cells. Budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has only the ACAT type of enzyme for the synthesis of SE (11Yang H.Y. Bard M. Bruner D.A. Gleeson A. Deckelbaum R.J. Aljinovic G. Pohl T.M. Rothstein R. Sturley S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In the bacteria, Aeromonas hydrophila, a secreted phospholipase that is structurally unrelated to animal LCAT, has also been shown to catalyze an LCAT reaction (12Thornton J. Howard S.P. Buckley J.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 959: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The enzyme(s) responsible for SE formation in plants are unknown so far. Based on biochemical studies, it was suggested that phospholipids and/or neutral lipid could serve as acyl donors (13Garcia R.E. Mudd J.B. Plant Physiol. 1978; 62: 348-353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Garcia R.E. Mudd J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Zimoswski J.

In the Arabidopsis genome, there is only one gene with reasonable homology to animal and fungi ACAT, but this gene has been shown to encode an acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT1) (10Hobbs D.H. Hills M.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). There is one gene in S. cerevisiae and six genes in the Arabidopsis genome with clear homologies to animal LCAT. The gene in S. cerevisiae has been shown to encode a novel type of enzyme, phospholipid: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT), that catalyzes the formation of triacylglycerols by transacylation of fatty acids from phospholipids to diacylglycerols (18Dahlqvist A. Stahl U. Lenman M. Banas A. Lee M. Sandager L. Ronne H. Stymne S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6487-6492Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Among the six LCAT-like genes in Arabidopsis, one has been shown to encode a PDAT (19Ståhl U. Carlsson A.S. Lenman M. Dahlqvist A. Huang B. Banaú W. Banaú A. Stymne S. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and another encodes a protein that, when expressed in S. cerevisiae, had phospholipase A1 activity (20Noiriel A. Benveniste P. Banaœ A. Stymne S. Bouvier-Nave P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3752-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We now report that a third of these LCAT-like genes in Arabidopsis encodes a PSAT. We have overexpressed the AtPSAT gene in Arabidopsis behind the 35S promoter, and we characterized the enzyme regarding substrate specificity and selectivity in microsomal membranes from the overexpressers. In addition we investigated the SE synthesizing activity in two T-DNA insertion mutants of the PSAT gene. Plant Material—Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia-0) plants were grown as described earlier (19Ståhl U. Carlsson A.S. Lenman M. Dahlqvist A. Huang B. Banaú W. Banaú A. Stymne S. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Plant materials for gene expression and enzymatic studies were obtained from liquid cultured plants (19Ståhl U. Carlsson A.S. Lenman M. Dahlqvist A. Huang B. Banaú W. Banaú A. Stymne S. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis insertion mutant lines (21Alonso J.M. Stepanova A.N. Leisse T.J. Kim C.J. Chen H. Shinn P. Stevenson D.K. Zimmerman J. Barajas P. Cheuk R. Gadrinab C. Heller C. Jeske A. Koesema E.

Marchand T. Risseeuw E. Brogden D. Zeko A. Crosby W.L. Berry C.C. Ecker J.R. Science. 2003; 301: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4153) Google Scholar) for the AtPSAT gene were identified in the Salk Institute T-DNA insertion library data base (signal-.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress), and seeds were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (University of Nottingham, UK). Screening for putative mutants was done by PCR (19Ståhl U. Carlsson A.S. Lenman M. Dahlqvist A. Huang B. Banaú W. Banaú A. Stymne S. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Individual plants from each mutant line lacking a T-DNA insertion in the AtPSAT gene (null segregants) were also identified in the same PCR screening. Isolation of AtPSAT cDNA—Primers designed from the genomic AtPSAT sequence N123456 (corresponds to protein At1g04010) were used to isolate an AtPSAT cDNA fragment using total RNA from 2-week-old Arabidopsis seedling. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from total RNA with the QuickPrep mRNA micropurification kit (Amersham Biosciences) and used to synthesize single-stranded cDNA with oligo(dT)18 primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Amersham Biosciences) by following the standard protocols of Sambrook et al. (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed.. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). PCR was performed on this cDNA using the primer 3027s11 (5′-TCCTAAACTCTGGCGATG-3′), primer 3027a11 (5′-CTTTCCCGTAATCCCAGT-3′), and AccuTaq (Sigma). The PCR product was diluted 1:40 and reamplified by using AccuTaq and primers 3027s12 (5′-AAAGTAGTTCTAGACACCGA-3′, the XbaI site is underlined) and 3027a12 (5′-CAATCCGCATCTAGAAGTG-3′, the XbaI site is underlined). The resulting PCR product was cleaved with XbaI and cloned into Bluescript II SK-. PCR was performed on 10 colonies using T3/T7 primers. One clone, pBL-3027, with an insert of the appropriate size was chosen and sequenced. A missing portion of its 3′ end was obtained with a modified vectorette PCR method (23Chenchik A. Diachenko L. Moqadam F. Tarabykin V. Lukyanov S. Siebert P.D. BioTechniques. 1996; 2: 526-534Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar) essentially as follows. Total RNA was isolated from Arabidopsis roots grown for 2 weeks in MS liquid media. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from about 60 μg of this total RNA with QuickPrep mRNA micropurification kit (Amersham Biosciences) and used to synthesize double-stranded cDNA with oligo(dT)18 primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Amersham Biosciences) by following the standard protocols of Sambrook et al. (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed.. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cDNA was made blunt-ended and ligated to the preannealed vectorette primers bub1 (5′-TCCTCTCCCTTCTCGAATTCTAAGCGGCCGCTCGAGGATCCCTGTCCTCTCCTTC-3′) and bub 2 (5′-GAAGGAGAGGACGCTGTCTGTCGAAGGTAAGGAACGGACGAGAGAAGGGAGAG-3′). Annealing of the vectorette primers was accomplished by mixing the primers (∼2 μm) in sterile water and heating at 65 °C for 5 min, whereupon MgCl2 was added to give a final concentration of 2 mm, and the mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature. PCR was performed on this cDNA linked to vectorette primers using the primer 3027sen1 (5′-GGATCATCACGGATATCATTTATGA-3′) and bubspec (5′-CGAATTCTAAGCGGCCGCTCGAGGATCCCT-3′, the XhoI site is underlined). Amplification was performed with AccuTaq (Sigma), and the conditions used for PCR were as follows: eight identical mixtures were amplified, with a final MgCl2 concentration of 2 mm, by an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, 35 cycles consisting denaturation 94 °C, 30 s; a linear gradient where samples varied in annealing temperature from 70 to 60 °C; elongation at 72 °C for 1 min. After a final elongation cycle at 72 °C for 5 min, samples were pooled, and an aliquot was reamplified by using the same conditions with the exception that the primer combination used was the bubspec primer together with a nested primer 3027si (5′-GATGAGACGGTACCCTATCATTCA-3′, the KpnI site is underlined). The PCR products from this reaction were cloned as XhoI/KpnI fragments into Bluescript II SK-, and PCRs were performed on 24 colonies using T3/T7 primers. Appropriate clones were identified by Southern blotting and sequenced. The clone pK3027/16-114 was identified having a stop codon and a poly(A) tail. To construct a full-length PSAT cDNA, a KpnI fragment of the At3027 cDNA fragment was cloned into the KpnI site of the plasmid pK3027/16-144 to give the plasmid pK9-126. Construction of Plant Expression Vector pGVP35S:AtPSAT—To constitutively express the AtPSAT gene, an XhoI/XbaI fragment of pK9-126 was placed downstream to the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (35S) promoter by cloning it into the XhoI/XbaI site of the binary vector pG35S2 and thereby creating pG35S3027-178 (pGVP35S:At-PSAT). The pG35S2 vector was obtained by replacing the napin promoter in the vector pGPVT-kan (24Becker D. Kemper E. Schell J. Masterson R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 1195-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) with the 35S promoter from pBI121 (Clontech). The construct integrity was confirmed by sequencing. Transformation of Arabidopsis—Arabidopsis plants were transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 harboring the binary plasmid pGVP35S:AtPSAT using the floral dip method (25Bent F.B. Clough S.J. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Homozygous T3 seed lines expressing AtPSAT as well as their null segregants were identified according to Ståhl et al. (19Ståhl U. Carlsson A.S. Lenman M. Dahlqvist A. Huang B. Banaú W. Banaú A. Stymne S. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and used for lipid and enzymatic analyses. RNA Isolation and RNA Blot Analysis—Root and leaf tissue of Wt plants grown on agar plates and leaves from T2 plants transformed with pGVP35S:AtPSAT, were used for RNA extraction. Ten μg of total RNA was analyzed for Northern blotting as described by Ståhl et al. (19Ståhl U. Carlsson A.S. Lenman M. Dahlqvist A. Huang B. Banaú W. Banaú A. Stymne S. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) using a 2-kb AtPSAT cDNA as probe. Lipid Substrates—[1-14C]Linolenic acid (18:3) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other 14C-labeled fatty acids, [4-14C]cholesterol, [1-14C]linoleoyl(18:2)-CoA, and di-[1-14C]palmitoyl(16:0)-phosphatidylcholine (PC), were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Unlabeled sn-1–18:1-lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) was obtained by phospholipase A2 (Naja mossambica mossambica, Sigma) treatment of di-18:1-PE (Avanti Polar Lipids) and subsequent isolation of the lyso-PE by TLC. All other unlabeled fatty acids and lipids were from Sigma. PC, PE, and phosphatidic acid (PA) with 1-14C-labeled acyl groups in the sn-2 position were synthesized by acylation of the corresponding [14C]acyl-trifluoroanhydride to the lysophospholipids (26Kanda P. Wells M.A. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 877-879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). sn-1-[14C]18:1-sn-2–18:1-PC was synthesized by chemical acylation of sn-1-[14C]18:1-lyso-PC obtained by phospholipase A2 treatment of di-[1-14C]oleoyl-PC and subsequent isolation of the formed lyso-PC by TLC. All radioactive substrates (with specific radioactivities of either ∼10,000 or 120,000 dpm/nmol) were checked on positional distribution of the radioactivity by phospholipase A2 (from N. mossambica mossambica or bee venom; Sigma) treatment, subsequent separation of the lipids by TLC, and measuring the relative distribution of radioactivity between lysophospholipids and free fatty acids. All sn-2-14C-substrates were found to have more than 95% of the radioactivity in the free fatty acids, whereas the sn-1-[14C]18:1-sn-2–18:1-PC had more than 90% of the radioactivity in lyso-PC. Radioactive substrates with high specific radioactivity (120,000 dpm/nmol) were used for characterization of SE synthesizing activity in membranes prepared from Wt and AtPSAT mutant plants. In all other assays, the specific radioactivity of the substrates was around 10,000 dpm/nmol. The sterols and related compounds used in experiments were either commercially available (cholesterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, sitosterol, and dihydrocholesterol) or extracted from Arabidopsis or tobacco tissues or yeast mutants, treated or not by sterol biosynthesis inhibitors. After purification (>90%), their structure was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Microsomal Membrane Preparations and Enzyme Assays—Microsomal fractions from leaves and roots of Arabidopsis plants grown in liquid culture were prepared as described previously (27Stobart K. Stymne S. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In order to remove most of the non-polar lipids from the membranes, the microsomal preparations for some enzyme assays were pretreated with acetone as follows. 1 ml of microsomal membranes (corresponding to 0.5–1.5 μmol of microsomal PC) in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, was added to 50 ml of cold (-80 °C) acetone under stirring, and the solution was left in a cold room for 10 min with slow stirring. The membranes were collected by centrifugation (5000 × g for 10 min), and the remaining acetone was removed under vacuum for 3 h. The acetone-treated membranes were then resuspended in 1 ml of water and stored in aliquots at -80 °C before being used in enzyme assays. Aliquots of crude or acetone-treated microsomal fractions (ranging from 5 to 24 nmol of microsomal PC, equivalent to 20–100 μg of protein) were lyophilized overnight. Various radioactive and non-radioactive substrates, added as indicated in the tables and figures, were dissolved in 15–30 μl of benzene and then added to the dried microsomes. The benzene was immediately evaporated under a stream of N2 at 35 °C, leaving the lipids in direct contact with the membranes, after which 0.1 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, was added. The suspension was thoroughly mixed and incubated at 30 °C. It should be noted that prolonged exposure of the microsomes to benzene severely affected sterol ester synthesis. The incubations were terminated, after periods of times indicated in the tables and figures, by extracting the lipids into chloroform (28Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). All enzyme assays were done at least in duplicate, and the amounts of the synthesized radioactive lipids never deviated more than 10% between duplicate samples from the same microsomal preparations. Data shown are standard means of replicates. Lipid Analysis—Lipids in the chloroform fractions obtained from the assays were separated by TLC with hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1 by volume) using straight phase Silica Gel 60 plates (Merck). Wax esters and SE co-migrated in the solvent front. To further resolve these lipids from each other as well as to separate SE with different acyl or sterol moieties, the lipids were eluted from the gel by methanol/chloroform (2:1), extracted into chloroform (28Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar), and rechromato-graphed on reversed phase high performance TLC (RPHPTLC; Merck) in acetonitrile/tetrahydrofuran (40:60 by volume). The radioactive lipids were visualized and quantified on the plates by using electronic autoradiography (Instant Imager, Packard Instrument Co.). This system separated 16:0/18:1, 18:0, 18:2, and 18:3 cholesterol esters from each other. Also, the dominating wax esters formed by the membranes from 14C-acyl substrates were clearly separated from the [14C]acyl-cholesterol by the RPHPTLC system. Furthermore, RPHPTLC separated some of the sterol esters with the same acyl group from each other, making it possible to do acyl acceptor competition experiments with the PSAT. Radioactive wax esters were synthesized in assays with all the different 14C-acyl substrates, but the amount, relative to the radioactive sterol esters formed, was not significant in the membranes from the PSAT overexpresser when cholesterol was used as an acyl acceptor. However, when some sterols that were poor acceptors were used or when assays were done with membranes from Wt or PSAT mutants, co-migration of wax esters and sterol esters was still a problem, even after separation on RPHPTLC. Also, the presence of endogenous sterols in the membranes gave a high “background” of sterol ester synthesizing activity in assays in the absence of added sterols. The formation of radioactive sterol esters and wax esters from 14C-acyl substrates in the absence of added sterols or fatty alcohols was reduced by 90% after acetone treatment of the microsomal membranes, indicating that most of endogenous sterols and fatty alcohols had been removed by the acetone. Furthermore, the specific activity of PSAT (based on amount of microsomal PC) was increased about 5-fold in the acetone-treated compared with untreated membranes. Quantification of the PC content in the microsomal fractions was done as described earlier (19Ståhl U. Carlsson A.S. Lenman M. Dahlqvist A. Huang B. Banaú W. Banaú A. Stymne S. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Determination of Sterol Ester Content in Planta—Sterol ester content of the two T-DNA insertion mutants and their null segregants were determined from plants grown in liquid medium. Lipids were extracted from freeze-dried material (100–200 mg), and sterol esters were purified by TLC and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as described previously (29Schaller H. Grausem B. Benveniste P. Chye M.L. Tan C.T. Song Y.H. Chua N.H. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Cloning of AtPSAT—In the search for the function of the six PDAT/LCAT-like genes found in the Arabidopsis genome data bases, we have identified previously the catalytic function of At5g13640 as a PDAT (19Ståhl U. Carlsson A.S. Lenman M. Dahlqvist A. Huang B. Banaú W. Banaú A. Stymne S. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and At3g03310 as a phospholipase A1 (20Noiriel A. Benveniste P. Banaœ A. Stymne S. Bouvier-Nave P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3752-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present paper we report the identification of the At1g04010 gene as a phospholipid:sterol acyltransferase (AtPSAT). Cloning and sequencing of AtPSAT (GenBank™ accession number AY989885) revealed a gene sequence of 4426 bases containing 15 exons and an open reading frame that encodes a protein of 633 amino acids (Fig. 1A). This protein shows 28% identity with human LCAT. It is, like the AtPDAT but unlike the soluble LCAT, predicted to have one membrane spanning region at the N-terminal end according to TMHMM2.0 (30Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9290) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the now published amino acid sequence for AtPSAT differs in its 3′ end from the existing predicted sequence in the GenBank™. Sequence Comparison between PSAT and Other LCAT-like Proteins—EST clones from Medicago truncatula (GenBank™ accession numbers BE321377 and BI267156) and Citrus sinensis (GenBank™ accession number CK939714) presenting strong homologies with AtPSAT were identified in data bases. After complete sequencing, these cDNAs were shown to encode proteins of 634 amino acids (MtPSAT) and 641 amino acids (CsPSAT) having 76 and 75% identity, respectively, with AtPSAT. In the frame of the rice (Oriza sativa) genome sequencing, a gene encoding a protein showing 73% identity with AtPSAT was also found. Alignments were performed for deduced amino acid sequences of the following cDNAs (Fig. 1B): a first group of plant PDATs, a second group containing AtPSAT and the three orthologues named MtPSAT, CsPSAT, and OsPSAT, genuine mammalian and avian lecithin cholesterol acyltransferases (LCAT), and various LCAT homologues. Isolation and characterization of plant cDNAs have been described elsewhere (20Noiriel A. Benveniste P. Banaœ A. Stymne S. Bouvier-Nave P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3752-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Six characteristic conserved regions are shown in Fig. 1B. From these alignments, it is clear that the catalytic triad (Ser-Asp-His) already found in mammalian LCATs (31Peelman F. Vinaimont N. Verhee A. Vanloo B. Verschelde J.L. Labeur C. Seguret-Mace S. Duverger N. Hutchinson G. Vandekerckhove J. Tavernier J. Rosseneu M. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), plant and yeast PDATs (19Ståhl U. Carlsson A.S. Lenman M. Dahlqvist A. Huang B. Banaú W. Banaú A. Stymne S. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and plant phospholipase A1 (20Noiriel A. Benveniste P. Banaœ A. Stymne S. Bouvier-Nave P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3752-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) is also present in Arabidopsis PSAT and putative PSATs. This triad is closely associated with the catalytic mechanism of LCAT enzymes in which a fatty acid is cleaved from the sn-2 position of phosphatidylcholine and trans-esterified to the free hydroxyl group of cholesterol to generate cholesterol ester. Site-directed mutagenesis at Ser-195, Asp-461, and His-546 of AtPSAT should be performed to validate this hypothesis in the case of plant PSATs. An important conserved hydrophobic domain (domain 1 from left to right in Fig. 1B) is found in all LCAT-like proteins. Yet its function is unknown. A second domain of interest (152AVPYDYRLSP in AtPS-AT) is highly conserved in all sequences of Fig. 1B. This domain might be involved in phospholipid binding for the following reasons. (i) All proteins listed in Fig. 1B use a phospholipid as substrate. (ii) It has been shown recently (32Zhao Y. Wang J. Gebre A.K. Chisholm J.W. Parks J.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13941-13949Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) that Glu-173, a residue of human LCAT situated inside this domain, is the molecular determinant for substrate specificity of HsLCAT for PC containing 18-versus 20-carbon sn-2 fatty acyl chains. (iii) It has been recently suggested that the amphipathic helix encompassing residues 175–198 in the human LCAT, which is very close to the domain of the PSAT considered here, could be involved in PC binding in human LCAT (8Jonas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). It is clear that a directed mutagenesis study of this domain (Ala-152... in AtPSAT) should give important information concerning substrate specificity (nature of the phospholipid substrate and of the fatty acid transesterified).

It exists as a full-length transmembrane protein and a soluble ectodomain that is proteolytically released from the cell surface by sheddases of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) family; TACE, the tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme, is the major physiological proteinase. Because both collagen XVII and the ADAMs are transmembrane proteins, their plasma membrane microenvironment can influence shedding. Lipid rafts, assemblies of sphingolipids and cholesterol within the plasma membrane, are responsible for the separation of membrane proteins and are thought to regulate shedding of cell surface proteins. In this study we analyzed the influence of the cholesterol-depleting agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), which disintegrates lipid rafts, on the shedding of collagen XVII in HaCaT keratinocytes and in transfected COS-7 cells. Increasing concentrations of MβCD led to a dose-dependent decrease of membrane cholesterol levels and to stimulation of collagen XVII shedding. The stimulation was completely inhibited by sheddase inhibitors, and experiments with COS-7 cells co-transfected with TACE and collagen XVII demonstrated that TACE mediated the low cholesterol-dependent shedding. Co-patching analysis by double immunofluorescence staining revealed co-localization of collagen XVII with the raft resident phosphatidylinositol-linked placental alkaline phosphatase and segregation from the non-raft protein human transferrin receptor, indicating that a majority of collagen XVII molecules was incorporated into lipid rafts. These data deliver the first evidence for the role of plasma membrane lipid organization in the regulation of collagen XVII shedding and, therefore, in the regulation of keratinocyte migration and differentiation.

Collagen XVII, previously called BP180, is a hemidesmosomal transmembrane protein (1Nishizawa Y. Uematsu J. Owaribe K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) that plays a critical role in maintaining the linkage between the intracellular and the extracellular structural elements involved in epidermal adhesion. This function is indirectly demonstrated by blistering skin diseases. Mutations in the collagen XVII gene, COL17A1, lead to junctional epidermolysis bullosa (2McGrath J.A. Gatalica B. Christiano A.M. Li K. Owaribe K. McMillan J.R. Eady R.A. Uitto J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), a human blistering skin disorder. Furthermore, in bullous autoimmune skin diseases, autoantibodies to collagen XVII perturb cell adhesion and lead to epidermal-dermal separation and skin blistering (3Schumann H. Baetge J. Tasanen K.

As a type II transmembrane protein, collagen XVII contains three 180-kDa α-chains that fold to form a homotrimer with collagenous triple helical segments built up by the typical Gly-X-Tyr repeat sequences. Each α-chain consists of an intracellular N-terminal domain of 466 amino acids, a short transmembrane stretch, and a large extracellular C terminus of 1008 amino acids (4Giudice G.J. Emery D.J. Diaz L.A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 243-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The ectodomain contains 15 collagenous subdomains, intervened by 16 short non-collagenous sequences.Collagen XVII belongs to the novel group of the collagenous transmembrane proteins (5Franzke C.W.

The cleavage occurs within the juxtamembranous NC16A domain of collagen XVII, and practically the entire ectodomain is released into the extracellular space. The functional role and the regulation of collagen XVII shedding are not yet fully understood. However, shedding is believed to influence cell detachment, differentiation, and motility in that cleavage of the ectodomain releases the cell from its binding partners and allows it to perform other functions. It also appears that the release of the ectodomain is regulated by protease activation cascades, their physiological inhibitors, or the membrane integration of collagen XVII.Lipid rafts were recently discovered to play a crucial regulatory role in the shedding of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (10Kojro E.

Neurochem. 2004; 89: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts, assemblies of sphingolipids and cholesterol within the plasma membrane, are fluid but tightly packed and well ordered, representing the liquid-ordered phase (15Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar). Because of its different density and melting point, the liquid-ordered phase floats around in the liquid-disordered matrix of the entire plasma membrane. Different proteins exhibit different association capacities to these cholesterol-rich microdomains, and protein incorporation into the rafts is a dynamic process. Thus, the principle by which rafts exert their functions is a separation or concentration of specific membrane proteins in the microdomains (16Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar). The variable distribution of proteins between the raft and non-raft phases could regulate protein-protein interactions and influence their functions (17Zheng X. Bollinger B.W. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 1487-1495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts have been found to be present in keratinocytes and to be rearranged during cell culture (18Gniadecki R. Christoffersen N. Wulf H.C. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 582-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells in suspension did not demonstrate any discernible lipid microdomains, but peripheral formation of lipid rafts was observed upon attachment and cell spreading. In addition, the formation of cholesterol-enriched, raft-like domains between adjacent cells was reported, suggesting that membranes of adherent cells are enriched in raft structures. Hence, the plasma membrane microstructure could be important for the adhesion of keratinocytes and, in particular, for the adhesive functions of collagen XVII. Therefore, this study focused on the role of the plasma membrane microenvironment in collagen XVII shedding. Our data propose a new mechanism in the regulation of collagen XVII shedding and provide a possible link to the low cholesterol-stimulated differentiation of keratinocytes (19Jans R. Atanasova G. Jadot M. Poumay Y. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2004; 123: 564-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures and Transient Transfections—HaCaT keratinocytes were cultured in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium supplemented with bovine pituitary extract and epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen) as described previously (3Schumann H.

COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (all from Invitrogen). One day before transfection, COS-7 cells were seeded to 90% confluence on 6-well plates and transfected with 0.5 μg of collagen XVII cDNA per well and Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in the air. Prior to the measurements, the cells were grown in presence of 50 μg/ml l-ascorbate for 48 h to allow for full prolyl and lysyl hydroxylation of newly synthesized collagens.Collagen XVII Shedding Assay—The media and cells were processed separately as described (3Schumann H.

Briefly, the medium was collected on ice, supplemented with 1 mm Pefabloc (Merck) and 1 mm EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich), and clarified from debris by centrifugation with 200 × g for 5 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed for 20 min in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 m NaCl, and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Then the cell lysate was scraped with a rubber policeman, and the extract was centrifuged at 13000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was used to analyze the total protein in each well. Shedding of the collagen XVII ectodomain was assayed using probes normalized in protein content. Medium samples were precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting with NC16A antibodies (3Schumann H. Baetge J. Tasanen K. Wojnarowska F. Schacke H.

Semiquantitative densitometry was done with the Gel-Pro Express 4.0 (Media Cybernetics Inc.).Modulation of Cellular Cholesterol and Sheddases—Cells undergoing cholesterol depletion were washed twice with PBS and then treated with 5–20 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) or 20–25 μg/ml filipin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 60 min. The reagents were diluted in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cholesterol was assayed spectrophotometrically using a cholesterol/cholesterol ester quantitation kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA). Total protein content was determined with a Bio-Rad Dc protein assay kit.For determination of the inhibition profile of cholesterol-dependent sheddases, HaCaT keratinocytes were treated with 10 mm MβCD in combination with the well known class-specific proteinase inhibitors E-64 (100 μm), pepstatin A (100 μm; Sigma), or 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF or Pefabloc) (1 mm; Merck) for 60 min. These low molecular weight inhibitors have low cell toxicity and do not effect the overall cell metabolism (20Diatchuk V. Lotan O. Koshkin V. Wikstroem P. Pick E. J. Biol.

For analysis of ADAMs, HaCaT keratinocytes and COS-7 cells transfected with collagen XVII cDNA were treated with 10 mm MβCD in combination with 35 μm BB3241 (British Biotech Ltd.) or 35 μm TNF-α protease inhibitor (Calbiochem) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 60 min.Immunofluorescence Staining and Antibody-induced Patching— COS-7 cells cultured on coverslips were co-transfected with collagen XVII cDNA or TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE) cDNA and phosphatidylinositol-linked placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) or human transferrin receptor (HTrR) cDNA, respectively. First the clustering of proteins was induced by incubation of the cells with the respective combination of monoclonal anti-HTrR antibodies (DakoCytomation, Hamburg, Germany; diluted 1:10 in PBS) or monoclonal anti-PLAP antibodies (Biomeda, Foster City, Canada; diluted 1:50 in PBS) and polyclonal antibodies against the recombinant NC16A domain of collagen XVII (3Schumann H. Baetge J. Tasanen K. Wojnarowska F. Schacke H. Zillikens D. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 685-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) (diluted 1:50 in PBS) or polyclonal anti-TACE antibodies H-300 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany; diluted 1:30) for 60 min at 12 °C. After washing with PBS, rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (DakoCytomation) were applied for 1 h at 12°C. Subsequently, the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and mounted in PBS, pH 7.0, containing 37% glycerol, 12.5% Mowiol (Calbiochem), and 0.65% N-propyl gallate (Sigma-Aldrich) as an anti-fade medium. Fluorescent images were taken on an Axiophot microscope equipped with AxioCam MRc digital camera (Carl Zeiss).As a negative control to demonstrate that the patching was indeed antibody-induced, co-transfected COS-7 cells on coverslips were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and then stained with the same set of primary antibodies in the respective dilutions. In this case the proteins were randomly distributed over the plasma membrane.RESULTSCollagen XVII Is Localized in Cholesterol-rich Lipid Domains—The putative presence of collagen XVII in cholesterol-rich microdomains was analyzed with co-localization experiments. Extracellularly exposed membrane proteins can be laterally cross-linked with specific antibodies; this process causes redistribution of the molecules with a tendency to form patches on the cell surface. This phenomenon can be used to visualize clustered lipid rafts in living cells when resident raft proteins and non-raft proteins are cross-linked with antibodies to large distinct patches in which raft markers co-patch and are segregated away from non-raft markers. We used PLAP, a well established raft resident protein (23Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 24Saslowsky D.E.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26966-26970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and HTrR, a non-raft protein (25Ehehalt R. Keller P. Haass C. Thiele C. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar), as markers. For the patching experiments, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with cDNA encoding collagen XVII and PLAP or HTrR, respectively, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies for 60 min at 12 °C to minimize the metabolic activity of the cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, the antibodies induced clustering of cell surface proteins; collagen XVII patches colocalized with PLAP patches and were segregated away from HTrR. In negative controls without antibody cross-linking, the proteins were randomly distributed over the entire plasma membrane. These findings indicate that a major portion of collagen XVII molecules are incorporated into lipid raft microdomains in the cell plasma membrane.Cholesterol Depletion of the Plasma Membrane Induces Shedding of Collagen XVII—Because cholesterol serves as a spacer between the hydrocarbon chains of sphingolipids and holds the assembled lipid raft together, its depletion leads to disorganization of lipid raft domains (Fig. 2A). Here, we analyzed the influence of the plasma membrane cholesterol level on collagen XVII shedding using the cyclic polysaccharide MβCD, which is a well known raft disruptor. MβCD contains a hydrophobic cavity that enables a selective extraction of cholesterol from the plasma membrane of different cell types (26Ilangumaran S. Hoessli D.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The addition of increasing concentrations (up to 20 mm) of MβCD to cultured HaCaT keratinocytes and COS-7 cells led to a concentration-dependent reduction of the cholesterol content in both cell lines (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Cholesterol depletion of the plasma membrane induces shedding of collagen XVII. a, schematic representation of cholesterol depletion by MβCD and the subsequent disruption the lipid rafts.

The cells were incubated with MβCD for 60 min, and the soluble collagen XVII ectodomain from the culture medium was analyzed by immunoblotting with NC16A antibodies (3Schumann H. Baetge J. Tasanen K.

Treatment with MβCD for 60 min resulted in a dose-dependent increase of shedding in HaCaT cells (Fig. 2C). Already, a small decrease of the total cellular cholesterol level led to significant enhancement. To ascertain that cholesterol-dependent shedding was not cell type-specific, we also treated collagen XVII transfected COS-7 cells with MβCD. These cells showed as well accelerated shedding of the ectodomain of collagen XVII with increasing MβCD concentrations (Fig. 2D).To validate the above results, the effect of another cholesterol binding agent was examined. Filipin, a polyene antibiotic, binds to cholesterol in the plasma membrane and prevents its interaction with sphingolipids, thus decreasing the stability of cholesterol-rich lipid microdomains (10Kojro E. Gimpl G. Lammich S. Marz W. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5815-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The addition of filipin to the culture medium of HaCaT keratinocytes increased collagen XVII shedding in a dose-dependent manner after 60 min of incubation (Fig. 3). In agreement with previous observations for CD30 shedding (11von Tresckow B. Kallen K.J. von Strandmann E.P. Borchmann P. Lange H. Engert A. Hansen H.P. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4324-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), filipin had a lower effect on collagen XVII shedding than MβCD because of its different chemical nature of lipid raft destabilization.FIGURE 3Stimulation of collagen XVII shedding by filipin. HaCaT keratinocytes were treated with 0–25 μg/ml filipin for 60 min, and soluble collagen XVII ectodomain in the culture medium was visualized by immunoblotting with NC16A antibodies (3Schumann H.

To examine the involvement of ADAMs in shedding stimulated by low cholesterol, the inhibition of cholesterol-dependent proteolysis was determined. MβCD-induced shedding was not inhibited by the aspartate protease inhibitor pepstatin A, the cysteine protease inhibitor E-64, or the serine protease inhibitor AEBSF (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the sheddase-directed hydroxamate inhibitors BB3241 (Fig. 4B) and TNF-α protease inhibitor (Fig. 4C, TAPI) effectively blocked MβCD-induced shedding of collagen XVII in HaCaT keratinocytes and transfected COS-7 cells. The MβCD-stimulated release of the ectodomain was reduced to 12–30% that of controls not treated with inhibitors. Remarkably, the relative inhibition between untreated and MβCD-treated cells was not changed. This indicates that no other proteolytic enzymes were involved in the MβCD-stimulated process.FIGURE 4ADAMs are responsible for low cholesteroldependent shedding of collagen XVII. A, inhibition profile of MβCD enhanced shedding. HaCaT keratinocytes were treated with 10 mm MβCD in combination with the protease inhibitors E-64(100 μm), pepstatin (100 μm), and AEBSF (1 mm) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 60 min, and the release of collagen XVII ectodomain into the medium was analyzed by immunoblotting with NC16A antibodies. B and C, HaCaT keratinocytes and collagen XVII cDNA transfected COS-7 cells were treated for 60 min with 10 mm MβCD in combination with 35 μm BB3241 (B) or 35 μm TNF-α protease inhibitor (TAPI)(C).

As shown in Fig. 5, co-transfection with TACE stimulated shedding of collagen XVII ∼2-fold as compared with controls without TACE. Subsequent MβCD treatment, i.e. cholesterol depletion, resulted in a further increase of shedding in the transfected cells, indicating that low plasma membrane cholesterol content enhances the shedding of collagen XVII by TACE.FIGURE 5TACE mediates low cholesterol-dependent shedding of collagen XVII. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of collagen XVII cDNA and 0.5 μg of murine TACE cDNA. 48 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 10 mm MβCD for 60 min, and the shed soluble collagen XVII ectodomain in the culture medium was identified by immunoblotting with NC16A antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To analyze the integration of TACE within the plasma membrane, we tested whether antibody cross-linking induced co-patching of TACE with the raft marker PLAP or with the non-raft marker HTrR. As shown in Fig. 1B, TACE patches co-localized with HTrR and were segregated away from PLAP. These observations indicate that a majority of TACE molecules is not incorporated into lipid raft microdomains.DISCUSSIONThe results of this study revealed that the distribution of plasma membrane cholesterol strongly affects the shedding of collagen XVII, because alteration of cholesterol content by MβCD increased the release of the collagenous ectodomain from the cell surface. This stimulatory effect of cholesterol depletion was not cell type-specific and correlated with the reduction of cellular cholesterol, suggesting that increased shedding depends on cholesterol depletion and not on other molecular interactions of the agent. This observation was supported by filipin binding to membrane cholesterol, which redistributed the cholesterol and also enhanced shedding in a dose-dependent manner.The inhibition profile of the enhanced proteolysis after cholesterol depletion favored metalloproteinases, especially the sheddases of the ADAM family as responsible for the enhanced cleavage of collagen XVII, because sheddase-directed hydroxamate inhibitors strongly suppressed the MβCD-induced shedding. Moreover, overexpression of TACE led to altered shedding after MβCD stimulation, implicating a key role of TACE in this process.Lipid rafts are cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched microdomains within the plasma membrane, and removal of raft lipids from the membrane leads to loss of their functions, particularly the regulation of protein-protein interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2084871978,"G protein-coupled receptors often employ novel signaling mechanisms, such as transactivation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors or G protein-independent signals transmitted by β-arrestins, to control the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). In this study we investigated the role of β-arrestins in lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor-stimulated ERK1/2 activation using fibroblast lines derived from wild type, β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2, and β-arrestin 1/2 knock-out mice. LPA stimulation produced robust ERK1/2 phosphorylation in all four backgrounds. In cells lacking β-arrestin 2, >80% of LPA-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation was mediated by transactivated EGF receptors. In contrast, ERK1/2 activation in cells expressing β-arrestin 2 was predominantly EGF receptor-independent. Introducing FLAG epitope-tagged β-arrestin 2 into the β-arrestin 1/2 null background restored EGF receptor-independent ERK1/2 activation, indicating that β-arrestin 2 expression confers ERK1/2 activation via a distinct mechanism. To determine the contributions of β-arrestin 2, transactivated EGF receptors, and ERK1/2 to LPA-stimulated transcriptional responses, we employed gene expression arrays containing cDNA markers for G protein-coupled receptor-mediated signaling. In the β-arrestin 1/2 null background, 1 h of exposure to LPA significantly increased transcription of seven marker genes. Six of these responses were EGF receptor-dependent, and two required ERK1/2 activation. In β-arrestin 2 expressing cells, three of the seven LPA-stimulated transcriptional responses observed in the β-arrestin 1/2 null background were lost. The four residual responses were independent of EGF receptor transactivation, but all were ERK1/2-dependent. These data indicate that β-arrestin 2 functions both to attenuate EGF receptor transactivation-dependent signaling and to promote a distinct subset of ERK1/2-mediated responses to LPA receptor activation.

These data indicate that β-arrestin 2 functions both to attenuate EGF receptor transactivation-dependent signaling and to promote a distinct subset of ERK1/2-mediated responses to LPA receptor activation. The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; G protein, guanine nucleotide-binding protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2; GFP, green fluorescent protein; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; MEF, murine embryo fibroblast; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; HEK cells, human embryonic kidney cells. comprise a large superfamily of seven membrane-spanning receptors that transmit extracellular signals by activating a variety of signaling pathways. All GPCRs function as ligand-activated guanine nucleotide exchange factors for heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding (G) proteins. The binding of ligand to a GPCR stabilizes the receptor in an “active” conformation in which it catalyzes GTP for GDP exchange on the Gα subunit of the GDP-bound heterotrimeric G protein, leading to dissociation of the GTP-bound Gα subunit from the Gβγ heterodimer. Once dissociated, both Gα-GTP and Gβγ subunits regulate the activity of enzymatic effectors, such as adenylyl cyclases, phospholipase C isoforms, and ion channels. Additional GPCR signaling mechanisms have been elucidated that are mechanistically distinct from the classical GPCR signaling paradigm. Most of these novel signals result from the binding of other proteins, such as PDZ domain-containing proteins or kinases, directly or indirectly to the intracellular domains of agonist-occupied GPCRs (1Hall R.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 2Brady A.E. Limbird L.E. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). One such mechanism involves the arrestins, a small family of cytosolic proteins originally identified for their central role in GPCR desensitization (3Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Arrestins are recruited to agonist-occupied GPCRs that have been phosphorylated on C-terminal Ser/Thr residues by specialized G protein-coupled receptor kinases. Arrestin binding sterically inhibits receptor-G protein coupling, producing homologous receptor desensitization. In addition, the C-terminal tails of the two non-visual arrestin isoforms, β-arrestins 1 and 2, contain binding motifs for clathrin and the β2-adaptin subunit of the AP-2 complex that allow β-arrestin to target the receptor for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The hypothesis that β-arrestins might also act as GPCR signal transducers originated with the finding that some Src family nonreceptor-tyrosine kinases bind to β-arrestins and are recruited along with it to agonist-occupied GPCRs (5Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F-T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). Subsequent work has identified a number of signaling proteins, including components of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Mdm2, and the cAMP phosphodiesterase, PDE4D, that are recruited in an analogous manner (6Luttrell L.M.

J. 2003; 375: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The general model is that β-arrestins function as adapter proteins that support the assembly of a multiprotein signaling complex on the receptor and initiate a second wave of G protein-independent signaling that commences as the receptor and G protein disengage. In many cases the effects of GPCRs on cellular growth and differentiation involve activation of the ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. The signaling mechanisms underlying GPCR-mediated ERK1/2 activation are complex and may result from activation of classical G protein-regulated effectors such as protein kinases A and C, from cross-talk between GPCRs and receptor-tyrosine kinases or focal adhesion complexes, or from β-arrestin scaffolding directly on the GPCR (9Gutkind J.S.

Depending on receptor and cell type, one mechanism may predominate or multiple mechanisms may be activated simultaneously. Although superficially appearing to be redundant, emerging data suggest that the different pathways leading to ERK1/2 activation downstream of GPCRs are not only mechanistically distinct but also determine the time course and spatial localization of ERK activity and perform different signaling functions. Despite recent insights into the mechanisms of GPCR-stimulated ERK1/2 activation, relatively little is known about the role of β-arrestins in modulating the transcriptional response to stimulation of GPCRs at physiologic levels of expression. Overexpression of β-arrestin 2, which is in effect a cytosolic ERK1/2-binding protein, has clearly been shown to promote cytosolic retention of active ERK1/2 and to attenuate GPCR-stimulated Elk1-luciferase reporter expression and mitogenesis after activation of angiotensin AT1a and vasopressin V2 receptors (12Tohgo A.

To better understand the function of β-arrestins in native systems, we capitalized on the existence of spontaneously immortalized clonal murine embryo fibroblast (MEF) lines derived from wild type, β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2, and β-arrestin 1/2 knock-out mice as well as β-arrestin 1/2 double knock-out MEFs in which β-arrestin 2 expression has been restored to endogenous levels by stable transfection (14Kohout T.A. Lin F.S. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar). Using these models we have characterized the contribution of G protein-dependent and β-arrestin-dependent signals to ERK1/2 activation by endogenously expressed LPA receptors and determined the contribution of these signals to the early transcriptional response to LPA. We find that in the absence of β-arrestin 2 expression, cross-talk between LPA and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors represents the dominant mechanism of LPA-stimulated ERK1/2 activation and accounts for the majority of the transcriptional responses detected using limited gene arrays. Expression of β-arrestin 2 confers ERK1/2 activation through an EGF receptor-independent mechanism while simultaneously promoting the rapid termination of the EGF receptor-dependent signal, resulting in an altered pattern of transcription. These results underscore the duality of β-arrestin function as both a terminator of G protein-mediated signaling and as a transducer of signals capable of mediating a distinct subset of LPA-stimulated transcriptional responses.

Miller (University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH). Cell Culture and Transfection—Wild type, β-arrestin 1 –/–, β-arrestin 2 –/–, and β-arrestin 1/2 –/– MEF lines were gifts from Robert J. Lefkowitz. These spontaneously immortalized clonal lines were derived from day 10.5 to day 13.5 embryos obtained from crosses between β-arrestin 1 (+/–) or β-arrestin 2 (+/–) mice bred to produce littermate wild type and knock-out embryos, as previously described (14Kohout T.A. Lin F.S. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar). Double β-arrestin 1/2 knock-out (D2) MEFs were generated from crosses of β-arrestin 1 (–/–) β-arrestin 2 (+/–) and β-arrestin 1 (+/–) β-arrestin 2 (–/–) mice. MEFs stably expressing FL-β-arrestin 2 on the β-arrestin 1/2 null background (D2-βarr2) were generated by calcium phosphate transfection of the D2 MEF line with pcDNA3.1-FL-β-arrestin 2-Hyg followed by clonal selection to obtain lines expressing near physiologic levels of β-arrestin 2. All MEF lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. HEK-293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Transient transfection of HEK-293 cells was performed using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Before all experiments, cell monolayers were incubated for 16–20 h in serum-free growth medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and penicillin/streptomycin. ERK1/2 Phosphorylation—To assay ERK1/2 phosphorylation in whole cell lysates, serum-starved cell monolayers in 12-well plates were stimulated at 37 °C as described and lysed directly with 1× Laemmli sample buffer. Sonicated samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 was detected by immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 IgG with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. Total ERK1/2, measured to confirm equal loading of whole cell lysate samples, was detected using polyclonal anti-ERK1/2 IgG. Immune complexes were visualized on x-ray film by enzyme-linked chemiluminescence and quantified using a Fluor-S MultiImager. For detection of FL-β-arrestin 2-associated phospho-ERK1/2, D2-βarr2 MEFs in 10-cm plates were stimulated as described, then solubilized in 1.0 ml of glycerol lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 100 μm benzamidine) containing 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and immunoprecipitation was performed using 20 μl of 50% slurry of monoclonal M2 anti-FLAG affinity agarose with constant agitation overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer before SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitated FLAG-β-arrestin 2 was detected using polyclonal anti-β-arrestin IgG. Coprecipitated phospho-ERK1/2 was detected as described. Assays measuring the fraction of total cellular ERK1/2 in the phosphorylated form exploited the fact that phospho-ERK1/2 exhibits faster electrophoretic mobility when subjected to PAGE under native conditions. D2 and D2-βarr2 MEFs in 6-well plates were stimulated as described, lysed in 200 μl of glycerol lysis buffer, and clarified by centrifugation. Aliquots of whole cell lysate containing ∼20 μg of protein were mixed with 5× sample buffer lacking SDS and β-mercaptoethanol and resolved by native protein electrophoresis on 10% precast Novex Tris-glycine gels run per the manufacturer's protocol. Total and phospho-ERK1/2 were detected by immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-ERK1/2 IgG and distinguished based on their differential electrophoretic mobility. Data were expressed as the fraction of total ERK1/2 signal present in the faster migrating phospho-ERK1/2 bands. Ras Activation—Ras activation was measured using the Ras activation assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, serum-starved D2 and D2-βarr2 MEFs in 10-cm plates were stimulated as described and lysed at 4 °C using the kit-supplied lysis buffer. GTP-bound Ras was isolated by binding to GST-Raf-1 Ras binding domain fusion protein on agarose beads and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Ras in the precipitates was visualized by immunoblotting with murine monoclonal anti-Ras IgG using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG for chemiluminescent detection. Immunoblots of total Ras in each lysate were performed to ensure equal protein content in the starting sample. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—For visualization of β-arrestin recruitment, HEK-293 cells transiently expressing influenza virus hemagglutinin epitope-tagged LPA1 receptors or influenza virus hemagglutinin epitope-tagged AT1a receptors and GFP-tagged β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 in collagen-coated 35-mm glass-bottom dishes were stimulated as described, washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, and again washed with phosphate-buffered saline before examination. To visualize the subcellular distribution of endogenous phospho-ERK1/2, D2 or D2-βarr2 MEFs were stimulated as described, fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, then incubated in blocking buffer (2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) for 30 min at room temperature. Phospho-ERK1/2 was stained overnight at 4 °C using a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 in blocking buffer. Monolayers were then incubated with a 1:250 dilution of AlexaFluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature before final washing and examination. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM510 laser-scanning microscope with a Zeiss 63 × 1.4 numerical aperture water immersion lens using single channel excitation (488 nm for GFP, 568 nm for rhodamine) and emission (515–540 nm GFP, 590–610 nm rhodamine) filter sets. RNA Isolation and Gene Expression Profiling—D2 and D2-βarr2 MEFs were grown to 75% confluence in 15-cm plates and serum-starved for 16–20 h before stimulation for 1 h as described. After stimulation, cells were harvested, and total cellular RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent and purified using the RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's protocols. Total RNA with A260/A280 >1.9 was used for synthesis of cDNA probes. Expression profiles were created using the SuperArray GEArray Q series mouse G protein-coupled receptor signaling PathwayFinder gene array. These nylon filter arrays contain 96 known mouse transcripts specific to GPCR signaling pathways, selected GPCRs, and standardization control markers. cDNA probes were synthesized from purified total RNA using GEarray-specific primers incubated with biotin-16-dUTP, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and RNase inhibitor. Gene arrays were prehybridized with sheared salmon sperm DNA before cDNA probe hybridization. Hybridization was done overnight at 60 °C for 16 h. Chemiluminescent gene array images were recorded on x-ray film. Scanalyze software was used to analyze optimally exposed radiographs. The abundance of each transcript was normalized to housekeeping gene markers on each array. Effect of β-Arrestin Content on the Mechanism of LPA Receptor-mediated ERK1/2 Activation in Knock-out Murine Embryo Fibroblasts—To determine the effect of varying the expression ofβ-arrestin isoforms on the mechanism of LPA receptor-mediated ERK1/2 activation, we initially studied clonal MEF lines derived from wild type, β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2, and β-arrestin 1/2 knock-out mice (14Kohout T.A. Lin F.S. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1A illustrates theβ-arrestin expression profile of each the four lines;wildtype, β-arrestin1 –/–, β-arrestin2 –/–, and β-arrestin1/2 –/– (D2 cells). As shown in Fig. 1B, exposure to LPA for 5 min resulted in ERK1/2 activation in all four lines. However, when stimulation was performed in the presence of tyrphostin AG1478, a selective inhibitor of EGF receptor family tyrosine kinases, differences in the pattern of ERK1/2 activation emerged. In the wild type and β-arrestin 1 –/– MEFs, both of which express β-arrestin 2, the LPA response was only modestly attenuated by a concentration of AG1478 that completely eliminated the response to EGF. In contrast, the response in the β-arrestin 2 –/– and D2 MEFs was almost completely sensitive to AG1478. Because inhibition by AG1478 is a hallmark of GPCR-stimulated ERK1/2 activation caused by EGF receptor transactivation (17Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 18Pierce K.L. Tohgo A. Ahn S. Field M.E. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1607-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), these results clearly demonstrate that β-arrestin expression is not required for cross-talk between LPA and EGF receptors. On the other hand, the persistence of LPA-stimulated ERK1/2 activation in AG1478-treated wild type and β-arrestin 1 –/– MEFs suggests that the presence of β-arrestin 2, but not β-arrestin 1, confers a mechanism of ERK1/2 activation that is independent of EGF receptor transactivation. Because each of the β-arrestin knock-out MEF lines was clonally derived, it was possible that the observed LPA signaling phenotypes represented clonal variation rather than a specific consequence of β-arrestin 2 expression. We, therefore, tested whether reintroduction of β-arrestin 2 into the D2 background was sufficient to confer AG1478-insensitive ERK1/2 activation. For these experiments, D2 MEFs were stably transfected with FLAG epitope-tagged β-arrestin 2 (FL-βarr2), and cells expressing FL-βarr2 at approximately endogenous levels (D2-βarr2) were derived using hygromycin resistance selection. A representative β-arrestin immunoblot illustrating the relative level of β-arrestin 2 expression in wild type and D2-βarr2 MEFs is shown in Fig. 2A. To determine whether FL-βarr2 expression qualitatively altered the pattern of endogenous LPA receptor expression, we performed RNA hybridization assays to measure the mRNA level of each of the three LPA receptor isoforms (LPA1–3). As shown in Fig. 2B, LPA1 and LPA3 receptor mRNA represented the major LPA receptor transcripts in the D2 MEFs. This pattern was not qualitatively changed in the D2-βarr2 MEFs. The relative abundance of LPA1 receptor mRNA did increase with FL-βarr2 expression, possibly reflecting an increase in LPA1 mRNA transcription related to the restoration of β-arrestin 2-mediated receptor turnover. As shown in Fig. 2C, D2-βarr2 MEFs exhibited a significant increase in LPA-stimulated AG1478-insensitive ERK1/2 activation compared with the parental D2 MEFs. These data indicate that expression of FL-βarr2 at a level comparable with that of endogenous β-arrestin 2 was sufficient to restore EGF receptor transactivation-independent ERK1/2 activation in response to LPA. We next compared the agonist dose dependence and extent of maximal LPA-stimulated ERK1/2 activation between D2 and D2-βarr2 MEFs. To compare the extent of ERK1/2 activation, we measured ERK1/2 phosphorylation as the fraction of the total ERK1/2 pool that underwent an electrophoretic mobility shift when whole cell lysates were resolved under non-denaturing conditions. As shown in Fig. 3A, 5 min of stimulation with LPA resulted in phosphorylation of 40–45% of the endogenous ERK1/2 pool in both D2 and D2-βarr2 MEFs. This compares with 55–60% ERK1/2 activation by EGF over the same time frame. Thus, despite the qualitative change in the predominant mechanism of ERK1/2 activation between β-arrestin null and β-arrestin 2-expressing MEFs, both pathways elicited responses of similar absolute magnitude. As shown in Fig. 3B, the EC50 for the early phase of LPA-stimulated ERK1/2 activation was also no different between D2 and D2-βarr2 cell lines. Effect of β-Arrestin 2 Expression on the Contribution of Transactivated EGF Receptors to LPA-stimulated ERK1/2 Activation—Fig. 4A compares the time course of LPA-stimulated ERK1/2 activation in D2 MEFs in the presence and absence of AG1478. In untreated cells, the maximal 10–15-fold increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed within 5–10 min of stimulation, after which phospho-ERK1/2 levels declined gradually over 30 min to 6–8-fold over basal, where they remained for up to 4 h. In these cells, >80% of the area under the phospho-ERK1/2 curve was eliminated by treatment with AG1478 (shaded area), indicating that LPA-stimulated ERK1/2 activation was primarily dependent on EGF receptor transactivation throughout the entire 4-h time course. As shown in Fig. 4B, a strikingly different pattern emerged when the experiment was repeated using D2-βarr2 MEFs. In the presence of β-arrestin 2, LPA-stimulated phospho-ERK1/2 levels rose to a similar 14–18-fold over basal within 5 min but then declined abruptly until reaching a sustained 6–8-fold over basal after 10–20 min. Moreover, although the early peak of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, like ERK1/2 activation in wild type MEFs (Fig. 1B), was partially AG1478-sensitive, the slower sustained phase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, between 10 min and 4 h, was not significantly inhibited. As a result, the AG1478-sensitive portion of the curve was largely confined to the first 10 min of stimulation (shaded area). This rapid termination of EGF receptor transactivation in D2-βarr2 MEFs probably reflects β-arrestin-dependent homologous desensitization of LPA receptors. Because an AG1478-sensitive ERK1/2 signal dominated in the β-arrestin null D2 MEFs, it is likely that the gradual decline and sustained duration of this signal reflected persistent G protein activation in the absence of receptor desensitization. Transactivated EGF receptors catalyze ERK1/2 activation by recruiting c-Raf1 to activated Ras at the plasma membrane. Incontrast, β-arrestin-dependent ERK1/2 activation appears to be a mechanistically distinct process that can occur under conditions where β-arrestin recruitment is induced in the absence of detectable G protein activation (20Ahn S.

Because FL-βarr2 expression led to rapid termination of EGF receptor-dependent ERK1/2 activation, we hypothesized that the duration of LPA-stimulated Ras activation would also be shortened in D2-βarr2 MEFs. To test this, we assayed Ras-GTP loading after stimulation of D2 and D2-βarr2 MEFs with LPA or EGF. As shown in Fig. 4C, exposure of D2 MEFs to either LPA or EGF produced robust Ras GTP loading that was maintained at 5 and 30 min after stimulation. In D2-βarr2 MEFs LPA-stimulated Ras GTP loading was detectable at 5 min, but by 30 min Ras-GTP levels had returned to approximately basal levels. EGF-stimulated Ras GTP loading resembled that observed in D2 MEFs. Because only the early component of LPA-stimulated ERK1/2 activation i"

The type 2 TNF receptor (TNFR2), however, is a poor activator of these signaling pathways despite its high TRAF2 binding capability. This apparent paradox is resolved here by the demonstration that TNFR2 carries a novel carboxyl-terminal TRAF2-binding site (T2bs-C) that prevents the delivery of activation signals from its conventional TRAF2-binding site (T2bs-N). T2bs-C does not conform to canonical TRAF2 binding motifs and appears to bind TRAF2 indirectly via an as yet unidentified intermediary. Specific inactivation of T2bs-N by site-directed mutagenesis eliminated most of the TRAF2 recruited to the TNFR2 cytoplasmic domain but had no effect on ligand-dependent activation of the NF-κB or JNK pathways. By contrast, inactivation of T2bs-C had little effect on the amount of TRAF2 recruited but greatly enhanced ligand-dependent NF-κB and JNK activation. In wild-type TNFR2 therefore, T2bs-C acts in a dominant fashion to attenuate signaling by the intrinsically more active T2bs-N but not by preventing TRAF2 recruitment. This unique uncoupling of TRAF2 recruitment and signaling at T2bs-N may be important in the modulation by TNFR2 of signaling through coexpressed TNFR1.

Killeen N. Lenardo M. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3038) Google Scholar). TNF itself is a highly pleiotropic cytokine that functions via binding to its type 1 and type 2 receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2) (2Lewis M. Tartaglia L. Lee A. Bennett G. Rice G. Wong G. Chen E. Goeddel D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2830-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Although many of the activities of TNF require TNFR1 signaling, TNFR2 does have independent signaling capabilities including the induction of T cell and thymocyte proliferation (3Tartaglia L.A.

Many cell types coexpress TNFR1 and TNFR2 and require cooperation between these two receptors to generate TNF responses. This is exemplified in a number of cases of TNF-mediated apoptosis (5Weiss T.

Immunol. 2000; 30: 652-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major difference between TNFR1 and TNFR2 is in their mode of signal transduction. TNFR1 belongs to a subgroup of TNFR superfamily molecules that carries a cytoplasmic death domain. Death domain TNFRs such as TNFR1 and Fas signal primarily via recruitment of death domain containing signaling molecules like TRADD, FADD, and RIP (9Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar, 10Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev.

On the other hand, non-death domain TNFRs such as TNFR2, CD30, CD40, 4-1BB, and receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) signal by directly binding members of the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family. There are six known mammalian TRAFs (TRAFs 1–6). Although TRAF6 can function in signaling through members of the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor superfamily as well as the TNFR superfamily (11Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 12Inoue J.-I. Ishida T. Tsukamoto N. Kobayashi N. Naito A. Azuma S. Yamamoto T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), TRAFs 1, 2, 3, and 5 arose later during evolution and appear specialized for TNFR signaling (13Grech A. Quinn R. Srinivasan D. Badoux X. Brink R. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 721-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). All mammalian TRAFs have a homologous carboxyl-terminal TRAF-C domain and adjoining coiled-coil of variable size (TRAF-N) (12Inoue J.-I. Ishida T. Tsukamoto N. Kobayashi N. Naito A. Azuma S. Yamamoto T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 14Park Y.C. Burkitt V. Villa A.R. Tong L. Wu H. Nature. 1999; 398: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In all but TRAF1, the amino-terminal half of the molecule consists of a RING finger domain followed by five or seven zinc finger motifs. Specific signaling functions have been assigned to TRAFs 2, 5, and 6, each of which can mediate JNK and NF-κB activation (15Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V.

Immunity. 2004; 21: 629-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). TRAFs bind to TNFR molecules and some other cellular proteins via their TRAF-C domain. In the case of TRAF2, all known binding sites present on TNFR molecules conform to a “major” consensus motif (P/S/A/T)X(Q/E)E, whereas the “minor” TRAF2 binding motif, PXQXXD, describes a separate class of TRAF2-binding sites found on the viral oncoprotein LMP1 and the regulatory protein I-TRAF/TANK (21Ye H. Park Y.C. Kreishman M. Kieff E. Wu H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Based on structural data, TRAF2 is recruited to ligand-trimerized receptors via a receptor binding groove on the TRAF-C domain, whereupon it assembles into a homotrimer via the TRAF-N domain coiled-coil (14Park Y.C. Burkitt V. Villa A.R. Tong L. Wu H. Nature. 1999; 398: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 22McWhirter S.M. Pullen S.S. Holton J.M. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Alber T. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Once trimerized, the amino-terminal regions of TRAFs are thought to interact with downstream effector molecules that link them to intracellular signaling pathways. These molecules include kinases such as MEKK1 (23Baud V. Liu Z.G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), NIK (24Malinin N.L.

Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). A number of studies involving ligand-dependent activation of TNFR2 expressed at physiological levels have failed to detect significant NF-κB or JNK activation by TNFR2 (27Laegreid A. Medvedev A.

Nevertheless, TNFR2 stably expressed at supraphysiological levels or transiently overexpressed in HEK293 cells is capable of efficient NF-κB and JNK activation (15Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 29Haridas V. Darnay B. Natarajan K. Heller R. Aggarwal B. J.

Unlike nearly all other non-death domain TNFR molecules, TNFR2 has only one known TRAF-binding site (14Park Y.C. Burkitt V. Villa A.R. Tong L. Wu H. Nature. 1999; 398: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 31Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Because TRAF2 but not TRAF5 or TRAF6 has been shown to bind to this site (17Ishida T. Tojo T. Aoki T. Kobayashi N. Ohishi T. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. Inoue J.-I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar), TNFR2 appears to utilize TRAF2 for signaling (15Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). The reason why TNFR2 efficiently recruits TRAF2 to its cytoplasmic domain but only rarely utilizes it to induce strong NF-κB and JNK activation remains unclear. To clarify the mechanism of TNFR2 signaling, we have carried out detailed mutagenesis of the TNFR2 cytoplasmic domain and analyzed the effects of mutations on signaling and TRAF2 recruitment. This has revealed a novel site located at the carboxyl terminus of TNFR2 (T2bs-C) that binds TRAF2 indirectly and down-regulates rather than promotes NF-κB and JNK activation by TNFR2. The presence of T2bs-C explains the uncoupling of TRAF2 recruitment and signaling by TNFR2, and may facilitate the collaborative induction of apoptosis by TNFR1 with TNFR2. GST Fusion Proteins—GST fusion proteins were produced using the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) as described (30Brink R. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem.. 1998; 273: 4129-4134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding GST fusions with mutant versions of TNFR2cyt were produced by PCR amplification of the wild-type construct with primer(s) encoding the relevant mutation(s) and subcloning of the amplified DNA fragments into pGEX-4T-1. Plasmid encoding GST fusion protein with the cytoplasmic domain of human lymphotoxin β receptor was achieved by PCR amplication from a human lymphotoxin β receptor cDNA clone (32Baens M. Chaffanet M. Cassiman J.J. van den Berghe H. Marynen P. Genomics. 1993; 16: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas the sequences encoding the TRAF6-binding site of hCD40 (amino acids 230–238) were incorporated into pGEX-4T-1 by direct ligation of complementary oligonucleotides. The presence of engineered mutations and the absence of polymerase errors were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Mammalian Expression Plasmids—Expression plasmids for murine TNFR2, TRAF2, and TRAF2ΔRF have been described (30Brink R. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem.. 1998; 273: 4129-4134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A CD40/TNFR2 expression plasmid encoding the extracellular domain of murine CD40 (mCD40, amino acids 1–191) fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of murine TNFR2 (mTNFR2, amino acids 257–474) was produced by PCR amplification of mCD40 (33Torres R.M. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 620-626PubMed Google Scholar) and mTNFR2 (30Brink R. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem.. 1998; 273: 4129-4134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) cDNAs with appropriate oligonucleotides, and ligation of the resulting PCR fragments into pcDNA3 (pc3, Invitrogen). Mutant versions of pc3-TNFR2 and pc3-CD40/TNFR2 were produced and verified as described for the GST-TNFR2ic expression plasmids. For production of stably transfected cell lines, cDNAs were transferred into the pIRES-neo expression vector (pIR, Clontech). pIRES-neo constructs encoding TRAFs containing an amino-terminal myc tag (MEQKLISEEDLLE) were produced by PCR from mTRAF1 (30Brink R. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem.. 1998; 273: 4129-4134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and mTRAF5 (17Ishida T. Tojo T. Aoki T. Kobayashi N. Ohishi T. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. Inoue J.-I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9437-9442Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) cDNAs. To express murine CD40L with an amino-terminal (intracellular) FLAG tag (FG-CD40L), CD40L cDNA was subcloned in-frame into the pcDNA4/HisMax plasmid (pc4, Invitrogen) into which the Xpress tag (DLYDDDDK) had been previously converted into a FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK). The presence of engineered mutations and the absence of polymerase errors were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Cell Lines—HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm HEPES, 0.043 m NaHCO3, 60 mg/liter of penicillin, 100 mg/liter of streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. Stably transfected HEK293 cells were generated using PvuI linearized plasmid and FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) transfection reagent. A pool (comprised of at least 20 independent clones) of stably transfected cells was obtained by growing the cells for 3 weeks in either 0.7 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) for pIRES constructs or 0.4 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) in the case of pc4-FG-CD40L. Stably transfected cells were maintained under drug selection and in each case were shown by flow cytometry to express the transfected receptor or ligand on the surface of greater than 90% of cells. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against TRAF2 (sc-876) and mCD40 (sc-977) as well as horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antisera were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal antibody against phospho-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK, was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Rat anti-mCD40 mAb (clone 3/23), hamster anti-mCD40 agonistic mAb (HM40-3), and hamster anti-mTNFR2 mAb (TR75-89) were from BD Pharmingen, agonistic goat anti-mTNFR2 from R&D Systems (AF-426-PB), mouse anti-FLAG mAb (M2) from Sigma, and mouse anti-myc mAb (9E10) from Invitrogen. Flow Cytometry—Transfected HEK293 cells were harvested in PBS, 1 mm EDTA and then washed and resuspended in PBS, 2% fetal calf serum, 0.1% sodium azide. Cells (2 × 106) were stained with either biotinylated anti-mCD40 (3/23) followed by streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (BD Pharmingen) or anti-mTNFR2 (TR75-89) followed by anti-hamster IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (BD Pharmingen). Data were collected on FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and live cells were identified on the basis of forward and side light scatter. GST Fusion Binding Assays—HEK293 cells were split into fresh 100-mm plates (2 × 106 cells/plate) 3 days before harvesting. Cells were harvested and lysed at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride). Where appropriate, lysates were preincubated for 1 h at 4 °C with peptide. Peptides used were T2bs-N wild-type (QVPFSQEEC) and T2bs-N mutant (QVPFEQEEC) and were purchased from Auspep (Melbourne, Australia). 500 μl of lysate was rotated for 2 h at 4 °C with 0.2 μg of the relevant GST fusion protein bound to GSH-agarose, and the beads washed three times in lysis buffer. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Myc or anti-TRAF2 antisera. Positive bands were detected by electrochemiluminescence. To test direct binding of TRAF2ΔRF, the protein was first synthesized using the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) and a pRC-TRAF2ΔRF expression plasmid according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro translated protein was then diluted in lysis buffer, GST fusion protein binding assays were performed as described above. In Vivo Binding Assays—To detect in vivo binding of TRAF2 by overexpressed CD40/TNFR2 molecules, HEK293 cells were transfected in 100-mm plates with 10 μg of expression plasmid using FuGENE 6 as described above. Cells were harvested 48 h later by incubation in PBS, 1 mm EDTA (5 min, 37 °C) and washed in cold PBS, 2% bovine serum albumin. Cell surface receptors were specifically bound with anti-mCD40 (3/23) by incubating intact cells with antibody (1 μg in 100 μl) at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times, resuspended in 0.5 ml of RIPA lysis buffer (PBS, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride), and mixed for 1 h at 4 °C, following which cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. Cell surface receptors were precipitated from the cleared lysate with 10 μl of Protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed, and bound material was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against receptor (anti-mCD40) and TRAF2 as described above. To detect recruitment of TRAF2 during ligand-dependent receptor activation, 106 HEK293 cells stably expressing wild-type or mutant CD40/TNFR2 were harvested as above, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, and mixed with an equal number of HEK293/FG-CD40L cells in a total volume of 200 μl for 10 min at 37 °C. The cell mixture was washed with PBS and then lysed in 1 ml of RIPA buffer, and debris was removed as above. Lysates were precleared with 10 μl of Protein G-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C, and then ligand-receptor complexes were immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of anti-FLAG antibody and 10 μl of Protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed, and receptor and TRAF2 were detected by Western blotting as described above. Luciferase Assays of NF-κB-dependent Transcription—To measure activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription by TNFR2 and CD40/TNFR2 receptors, a firefly luciferase-based reporter construct (pGL3-mESEL) was produced by inserting a 227-bp PCR fragment from the NF-κB-dependent promoter for murine E-selectin (–174 to +53) (34Schindler U. Baichwal V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5820-5831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) between the XhoI and HindIII sites of the pGL3 plasmid (Promega). A control plasmid encoding sea pansy (Renilla) luciferase driven by the constitutive herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase promoter (pRL-TK, Promega) was also used. Cells stably expressing transfected receptor were plated in 24-well dishes (Nunc) (5 × 104 cells/well) and transfected 8 h later with 50 ng of pGL3-ESEL and 200 ng of pRL-TK. 16 h later, HEK293/FG-CD40L cells (or untransfected control HEK293 cells) were harvested in PBS, 1 mm EDTA, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, and layered onto the receptor expressing cells. Alternatively cells were stimulated with agonistic anti-mCD40 mAb (HM40–3) or anti-mTNFR2 polyclonal antiserum (10 μg/ml). Cells were harvested 2 or 6 h later, and relative induction of NF-κB-dependent transcription was determined as above using untransfected or vector (pIR)-transfected targets as the reference (=1.0). Detection of Activated NF-κB Transcription Factors—To detect activation of NF-κB transcription factors directly, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent based assay was used. Equal numbers (1.5 × 105) of cells stably expressing transfected receptor were plated in 48-well dishes as above and stimulated 16 h later with anti-mCD40 (5 μg/ml HM40-3). After stimulation, cells were harvested, lysed, and specific levels of p50 and p65 NF-κB transcription factors capable of binding to a consensus NF-κB recognition site (GGGACTTTCC) were assayed using Trans-AM NF-κB Transcription Factor Assay Kits (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Receptor-dependent induction was determined for each cell line by calculating the increase in absorbance relative to unstimulated cells. JNK Activation Assay—Equal numbers (4 × 105) of cells stably expressing transfected receptor were plated in 24-well dishes and stimulated 48 h later with anti-mCD40 (5 μg/ml HM40–3) for various times. Cells were harvested with cold PBS, 1 mm EDTA, lysed in RIPA Lysis Buffer for 20 min, and the lysate resuspended in LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen), 0.05 m dithiothreitol for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-phospho-JNK antibody. TNFR2 Possesses a Second Carboxyl-terminal TRAF2-binding Site (T2bs-C)—To clarify the role of TRAF2 in TNFR2 signaling we set out to introduce point mutations into the known TRAF2-binding site of murine TNFR2 (mTNFR2). TRAF2 binds to human TNFR2 (hTNFR2) via a short peptide sequence located between amino acid residues 420 and 428 (14Park Y.C. Burkitt V. Villa A.R. Tong L. Wu H. Nature. 1999; 398: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and the corresponding area in mTNFR2 (residues 422–430) varies by only one amino acid (Fig. 1A). Mutations were introduced into fusion receptors comprising the extracellular domain of murine CD40 (mCD40) and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of mTNFR2 (Fig. 1A). The rationale for using this approach was that it allows specific activation and immunoprecipitation of transfected CD40/TNFR2 receptors independent of endogenous TNF receptors while maintaining the signaling integrity of the TNFR2 cytoplasmic domain (35Clement M.V. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 36Munroe M.E. Bishop G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; Google Scholar). Three different approaches were used to inactivate the TRAF2-binding site of mTNFR2: (i) alteration of the critical serine residue (21Ye H. Park Y.C. Kreishman M. Kieff E. Wu H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) to glutamic acid (S426E), (ii) simultaneous mutation of the four residues conserved in the closely related TRAF2-binding site of CD30 (37Lee S.Y. Park C.G. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) (V423D, S426E, E428A, E429A), and (iii) complete deletion of the TRAF2-binding site (Δ417–429) (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, when CD40/TNFR2 molecules carrying these mutations were tested for TRAF2 binding following transient transfection and overexpression in HEK293 cells, all of them retained the ability to bind TRAF2 (Fig. 1B). This indicated that TNFR2 must have a second previously unknown TRAF2-binding site. Because truncation of the mTNFR2 cytoplasmic domain immediately after Ser-426 (–48 deletion, Fig. 1A) completely inactivates TRAF2 binding (30Brink R. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem.. 1998; 273: 4129-4134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 31Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar), the second TRAF2-binding site of mTNFR2 must be located carboxyl-terminal of the known site. Because of their relative amino- and carboxyl-terminal positioning, the “old” and “new” TRAF2 binding sites of TNFR2 were designated T2bs-N and T2bs-C, respectively (Fig. 1A). To locate T2bs-C more precisely, a series of fusion proteins between GST and mutant forms of the mTNFR2 cytoplasmic domain (mTNFR2cyt) were produced and used in a TRAF2 binding assay. Consistent with the results obtained using CD40/TNFR2 fusion receptors, the S426E mutation alone did not inactivate TRAF2 binding to GST-mTNFR2cyt (Fig. 1C). TRAF2-binding was also preserved by a truncation immediately after T2bs-N (–42, Fig. 1A) but was abolished when this truncation was combined with the S426E mutation (Fig. 1C). This result confirmed that T2bs-C is located toward the carboxyl terminus, and demonstrated that the S426E mutation alone is sufficient to inactivate T2bs-N. Combination of S426E with serial truncations of mTNFR2cyt showed that residues required for TRAF2 binding are located between the –18 and –13 truncation sites (residues 457–461) (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, this area corresponds to the terminal residues of hTNFR2 (mTNFR2 has an extra 13 carboxyl-terminal residues) (2Lewis M. Tartaglia L. Lee A. Bennett G. Rice G. Wong G. Chen E. Goeddel D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2830-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). This finding was replicated in co-immunoprecipitation studies using full-length CD40/TNFR2 molecules overexpressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1D) confirming that the S426E and –18 mutations fully inactivate T2bs-N and T2bs-C, respectively. T2bs-C Is a Novel TRAF2-binding Site—To characterize the TRAF binding capabilities of T2bs-C, we tested the ability of GST-mTNFR2cyt molecules containing either T2bs-N or T2bs-C alone (–18 or S426E, respectively) to bind TRAF family members other than TRAF2. As is shown in Fig. 2A, T2bs-N is capable of binding TRAF1 as well as TRAF2, but cannot recruit TRAFs 3, 5, or 6. T2bs-C on the other hand binds only TRAF2. To localize T2bs-C more precisely, GST fusion proteins were produced that contained short stretches of peptide sequence derived from the area immediately amino-terminal of the –13 truncation site of mTNFR2. TRAF2 binding studies using these fusion proteins indicated that T2bs-C lies between amino acids 448 and 459 of mTNFR2 (Fig. 2B). This area of mTNFR2 is almost completely homologous to the corresponding sequence in hTNFR2 (Fig. 1A). Alanine scanning mutagenesis of this area indicated that at least six different amino acid side chains were critical for TRAF2 binding. Uncharacteristically for a TRAF2-binding site, four of these side chains were hydrophobic (Leu449, Leu451, Val453, and Met458) (Fig. 2B). Indeed T2bs-C appears to be an atypical TRAF2-binding site and does not conform to either the major or minor TRAF2 binding consensus motifs ((P/S/A/T)X(Q/E)E and PXQXXD, respectively) (21Ye H. Park Y.C. Kreishman M. Kieff E. Wu H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). T2bs-C Appears to Bind TRAF2 Indirectly—The lack of homology between T2bs-C and other known TRAF2-binding sites raised the possibility that T2bs-C does not bind TRAF2 directly but rather binds an intermediary protein that in turn interacts with TRAF2. To test whether TRAF2 binds T2bs-C directly, TRAF2 was synthesized in vitro using a cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate and then assayed for binding to GST fusion proteins carrying T2bs-C alone. In this system, full-length TRAF2 exhibited nonspecific binding to GST fusion proteins that lacked both TRAF2-binding sites (i.e. S426E/–18; data not shown)."
https://openalex.org/W2015909441,"We reported previously that chicken HIRA, a homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptional co-repressors Hir1p and Hir2p, possesses seven WD dipeptide motifs and an LXXLL motif in its N-terminal and C-terminal halves, respectively, required for transcription regulations. Here, by using the gene targeting technique, we generated the homozygous HIRA-deficient DT40 mutant DeltaHIRA. The HIRA deficiency caused slightly delayed cell growth and affected the opposite transcriptions of cell cycle-related genes, i.e. repressions for P18, CDC25B, and BCL-2, activations for P19 and cyclin A, and histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. These altered expressions were completely revived by the artificial stable expression of hemagglutinin-tagged HIRA in DeltaHIRA. The ability to rescue the delayed growth rate was preferentially aided by the N-terminal half instead of the C-terminal half. We cloned the chicken P18 genomic DNA, and we established that its promoter was located surrounding the sequence GCGGGCGC at positions -1157 to -1150. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that the N-terminal half interacted directly or indirectly with the putative promoter region of the p18 gene, resulting in up-regulation of the gene. These results indicated that the N-terminal half of HIRA should contribute positively to the growth rate via up-regulation of a set of cell cycle-related genes, whereas the C-terminal half down-regulated another set of them without exhibiting any effect on the cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2073935530,"c-Src plays a crucial role in osteoclastogenesis. In this study, we searched for c-Src-binding proteins using a combination of pull-down assays and mass spectrometric analysis, and identified the association of adhesion and degranulation promoting adaptor protein (ADAP) with c-Src in RAW264 cells and osteoclast precursors prepared from bone marrow cells. The kinase activity and the SH2 domain of c-Src were required for this association and Tyr807 in the extreme carboxyl terminus of ADAP was identified as a major recognition site. ADAP was found to be expressed in cells at the prefusion stage and localized mainly in the leading edge of lamellipodia and in pseudopodia. Tyrosine phosphorylation of ADAP was induced in an integrin-dependent manner, and the level was Src kinase-dependent. ADAP-knockdown RAW264 cells showed retarded migration and formed few multinucleated cells. Cas, known to be phosphorylated by c-Src, was identified as a major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in differentiating RAW264 cells and the phosphorylation appeared to be decreased in ADAP-knockdown cells. ADAP thus may play an important role as a partner of c-Src for cell migration and progression to the multinucleated cell stage in osteoclastogenesis in vitro. c-Src plays a crucial role in osteoclastogenesis.

Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar, 2Yeatman T.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). c-src was originally identified as the cellular homologue of the v-src transforming gene of Rous sarcoma virus (3Stehelin D.

Cell. 1983; 32: 881-890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In contrast to v-src, which has attracted much attention as a transforming gene, the physiological role of c-src had been obscure until Soriano et al. (5Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar) reported the osteopetrotic phenotype in src knock-out mice. Namely, targeted disruption of c-src in mice was found to lead to a prominent phenotype, osteopetrosis, or a failure to break down bone, resulting from an intrinsic functional defect in osteoclasts, a cell type that expresses a high level of Src (6Horne W.C.

Furthermore, although a group of genes belonging to the src family was known to be expressed in osteoclasts (6Horne W.C. Neff L. Chatterjee D. Lormi A. Levy J.B. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), the phenotype observed in c-src knock-out mice was not obtained for other genes of the family (1Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S.

They are reported to be formed by the fusion of mononuclear precursor cells derived from colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophages and branch from the monocyte-macrophage lineage during the early stages of the differentiation process (10Chambers T.J.

Rev. 1999; 20: 345-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This differentiation process is known to be triggered by a factor named receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) (11Suda T. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Jimi E. Gillespie M. Martin T.J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 345-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hsu H. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Solovyev I. Colombero A. Timms E. Tan H.L. Elliott G.

RANKL binds to the cytoplasmic membrane receptor RANK (receptor activator of NF-κB) expressed on precursor cells, and activates multiple signaling pathways involving transcription factors NF-κB, AP-1, and NFAT2, which are essential for osteoclastogenesis (13Tanaka S.

Recently, we reported the significance of c-src in the formation of MN cells using an in vitro differentiation system consisting of RAW264 cells and RANKL (18Kumagai N. Ohno K. Tameshige R. Hoshijima M. Yogo K. Ishida N. Takeya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 758-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This system was previously reported to form multinucleated cells with pit forming activity on dentine slices, mineral hydrolyzing ability on hydroxyapatite-coated plates, and responsiveness to therapeutic reagents such as bisphosphonates and calcitonin (12Hsu H. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Solovyev I. Colombero A. Timms E. Tan H.L. Elliott G. Kelley M.J. Sarosi I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We found that the expression of c-src was under the control of NF-κB and AP-1 in RAW264 cells, and that when suppressed using antisense src, the formation of MN cells was severely hampered (18Kumagai N. Ohno K. Tameshige R. Hoshijima M. Yogo K. Ishida N. Takeya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 758-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), suggesting that c-Src plays an important role in osteoclastogenesis in vitro as well and also that the functional role of c-Src may be investigated using this in vitro system. Although the precise functional mechanism of c-Src, in particular, the contribution of c-Src kinase activity to osteoclast function, remains to be elucidated (20Schwartzberg P.L. Xing L. Hoffmann O.

Chem. 2004; 279: 17660-17666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), it is generally accepted that c-Src plays an important role as an adaptor protein as well, suggesting that finding effector molecules of c-Src may be beneficial to our understanding of the role of c-Src in osteoclastogenesis. In this study, we searched for c-Src-binding proteins with its SH3 and SH2 domains as a probe in differentiating RAW264 cells using mass spectrometric analysis. As a result, we identified 10 species of proteins including adhesion and degranulation-promoting adaptor protein (ADAP). ADAP (formerly known as SLAP-130 or FYB) possesses a number of domains predicted to mediate protein-protein interaction and is known to play an important role in “inside-out” signaling leading to the activation of integrins and to enhanced cellular adhesion to integrin ligands (22Griffiths E.K. Penninger J.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Peterson E.L. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 192: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because the association of ADAP with c-Src was identified for the first time, we investigated the mechanism involved in the association and also investigated the functional role of ADAP in both RAW264 cells and osteoclast precursors prepared from bone marrow cells. Osteoclastogenesis in Vitro and Cell Culture—Soluble recombinant RANKL was prepared as described previously (24Meiyanto E. Hoshijima M. Ogawa T. Ishida N. Takeya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For osteoclastogenesis in vitro, RAW264 cells were plated at a density of 1.3 × 104 cells/cm2 on the day before RANKL treatment (25Ishida N. Hayashi K. Hoshijima M. Ogawa T. Koga S. Miyatake Y. Kumegawa M. Kimura T. Takeya T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41147-41156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). GST and RANKL were added to final concentrations of 250 and 500 ng/ml, respectively. After 72 h, the medium was changed to fresh medium containing GST or RANKL, and incubation continued for another 24-h incubation. Osteoclast precursors were generated from mouse bone marrow cells by treatment with M-CSF as described previously (18Kumagai N. Ohno K. Tameshige R. Hoshijima M. Yogo K. Ishida N. Takeya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 758-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Mouse bone marrow cells obtained from bone marrow of 6-week-old female ddY mice (CLEA Japan or Japan SLC) were cultured overnight in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Thermo Trace), antibiotics, and 1% culture supernatant of NIH3T3/pCAhMCSF cells (MCSF-CM), which stably express human M-CSF (RIKEN DNA Bank, Japan). Non-adherent cells were collected, and replated in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 3% MCSF-CM as described above. Bone marrow macrophages were obtained as adherent cells, and were replated and induced to become osteoclast cells under the conditions described for the RAW264 system. In both systems of osteoclastogenesis, pre-fusion osteoclasts and multinucleated osteoclasts were obtained at 48 and 96 h after the RANKL was added, respectively. Cells were fixed and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity on plastic dishes as described previously (25Ishida N. Hayashi K. Hoshijima M. Ogawa T. Koga S. Miyatake Y. Kumegawa M.

Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were carried out essentially as described previously (25Ishida N. Hayashi K. Hoshijima M. Ogawa T. Koga S.

Antibody-protein complex was precipitated with Protein G-Sepharose or Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) linked to rabbit IgG fraction to mouse IgG (MP Biomedicals). Immunoblot detection was performed with an ECL detection kit, and sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Mouse anti-Src monoclonal antibody (OP-07) was obtained from Calbiochem Oncogene Research Products. Mouse anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (AC-74) and mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2) were purchased from Sigma. Mouse anti-ADAP and anti-Cas antibodies were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. Mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Depletion of Cas was carried out by incubating cell lysates for 6 h at 4 °C with anti-Cas antibody. Pull-down Assay with GST-Src and Mass Spectrometry—Cell lysates were prepared from RAW264 cells cultured for 4 days in the presence of RANKL under regular conditions. GST-fused SH3 and/or SH2 domains of c-Src were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's directions. Fifty micrograms of purified GST or GST-Src protein and 10 mg of protein from cell extracts were incubated at 4 °C for 6 h. After four washes with buffer H (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol), the bound proteins were eluted in 100 μl of buffer H containing 500 mm NaCl. Proteins in the recovered fraction were concentrated and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (1-mm thickness and 10-cm long). Proteins were stained with Sypro Ruby (Molecular Probes) and visualized by UV illumination. Mass spectrometric analysis and data base searches were carried out essentially as described previously (26Kuwana R. Kasahara Y. Fujibayashi M. Takamatsu H. Ogasawara N. Watabe K. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3971-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For small scale pull-down assays, osteoclasts were lysed with GST pull-down buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 2 mm NaVO4, 10 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors), and the lysates were incubated with GST-fused protein. Associated proteins were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B. Vector Construction—A cDNA encoding mouse full-length c-Src was obtained from mRNA of RAW264 cells by reverse transcription-PCR and cloned into the expression vector pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) or the retroviral expression vector pCX4-puro, which was kindly provided by Dr. T. Akagi (Osaka Bioscience Institute, Japan) (27Akagi T. Sasai K. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13567-13572Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The Unique-SH3 domain (amino acids 1–149) and the Unique-SH3-SH2 domain (amino acids 1–262) of c-Src were also obtained as described above and cloned into the fusion vector pGEX-3X GST (Amersham Biosciences). Kinase-defective (K295M) (KD) and catalytically active (Y527F) (CA) variants of c-Src were generated with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's directions. A cDNA encoding p130 ADAP was obtained as described above, and cloned into the expression vector pFLAG/CMV2 (Eastman Kodak Co.) or pCX4-puro. Truncated mutants of ADAP were generated by digestion of ADAP on pFLAG/CMV2 by EcoRI (ADAP amino acids 1–326) or BglII (ADAP amino acids 1–614), and vectors were self-ligated. To generate YF mutants of ADAP, a single amino acid substitution of tyrosine for phenylalanine was performed using the mutagenesis kit described above. For the expression of short interfering (si) RNA, we selected two target sequences specific to mouse ADAP: 5′-AACCTACCTACGAGGAGAA-3′ (from 200 to 218) as siADAP-1 and 5′-AAGCCTGCTGCGATGTCAA-3′(from 1514 to 1532) as siADAP-2. Each target sequence was designed as oligonucleotides in both the sense and antisense orientation separated by spacer sequence, and pairs of oligonucleotides were purchased from Nippon Egt (Japan). Annealed oligonucleotides were cloned into the expression vector pSuper (OligoEngine) carrying a neo-resistant gene. Transfection and Retroviral Infection—HEK293 cells were transfected using the polyethylenimine method as described previously (28Thomas M. Klibanov A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14640-14645Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In brief, 7.5 μg of DNA dissolved in 5% glucose, PBS was mixed with 3.3 mm polyethylenimine 25, 5% glucose, PBS for 20 min, and the solution was added to cells in a 60-mm culture dish. To establish ADAP-knockdown RAW264 cells, cells were transfected with pSuper-siADAP-1 and siADAP-2 or empty vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and neo-resistant clones were isolated. For the production of retroviruses, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with pGL, pE-Eco (TaKaRa), and pCX4-puro encoding c-Src or ADAP variants using FuGENE 6 (Roche). The supernatant was collected 2 days after transfection, and viruses were concentrated by centrifuging at 8,000 × g for 16 h. RAW264 cells were infected for 2 days, and puro-resistant cells were established as stable transfectants. Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Image Analysis—Immunostaining was performed as described previously with some modification (29Geng L. Pfister S. Kraeft S.K. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11527-11532Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In brief, cells on coverslips were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (Taab Laboratories) in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After the blocking of nonspecific binding with 5% skim milk, 5% fetal calf serum, PBS for 30 min, cells were incubated with anti-ADAP monoclonal antibody for 30 min, and then with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) for 30 min. Coverslips were mounted in PERMAFLUOR (Immunotech) onto glass slides. Fluorescent images were taken under a confocal laser scanning microscope LSM410 (Carl Zeiss), and processed with Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems). Time-lapse Microscopic Analysis—Cells on 12-well plates were stimulated with RANKL and cultured for 2 days to prepare osteoclast precursors at the pre-fusion stage. Cells covered with mineral oil were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere in a stage chamber and observed using Axiovert 200M (Carl Zeiss). Phase-contrast images were captured every 5 min for 10–15 h with AxioVision 3.1 software (Carl Zeiss). Migration distance was calculated by digitizing the translocation of the center of the nucleus in successive images using Scion Image software (Scion Corp.). Identification of ADAP as a c-Src-binding Protein—To identify c-Src-binding proteins, we prepared GST-fused constructs containing the unique region, the SH2 and SH3 domains of mouse c-src (GST-U·SH3·SH2) (Fig. 1A), and recovered proteins by the pull-down method from lysates of RANKL-induced RAW264 cells. We identified discrete bands specific to GST-U·SH3·SH2 on SDS-PAGE, subjected them to mass spectrometric analysis, and finally assigned them after a data base search (Fig. 1A). Of the 10 proteins thus identified, the interaction of SHIP1 (30Giuriato S. Bodin S. Erneux C. Woscholski R. Plantavid M. Chap H. Payrastre B. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), ASAP1 (31Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), WASP/WIP (32Banin S. Truong O. Katz D.R. Waterfield M.D. Brickell P.M. Gout I. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 981-988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and SAM68 (33Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) with c-Src has been reported, but the significance of the binding of Hsp70 and ribosomal protein L6 is not clear. The interaction between c-Src and ADAP was a novel finding; 9 peptides could be assigned in ADAP and the sequence coverage was 16% (data not shown). ADAP was originally identified as an adapter protein capable of binding to several proteins including Fyn, and its role in”inside-out“signaling upon T-cell receptor activation has been demonstrated (22Griffiths E.K. Penninger J.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Peterson E.L. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 192: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). ADAP appeared to bind c-Src through the SH2 domain (Fig. 1B). ADAP was identified as doublet, suggesting that RAW264 cells expressed two isoforms, p120 and p130 (34Veale M. Raab M. Li Z. da Silva A.J. Kraeft S.K. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Rudd C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28427-28435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Tyr807 of ADAP Is a Major Recognition Site—To confirm the association of ADAP (p130) with full-length c-Src in cells, we ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged ADAP in HEK293 cells together with either the wild type, CA, or KD variants of c-Src (Fig. 2A). Both wild type and CA c-Src appeared to co-precipitate with Tyr-phosphorylated ADAP, whereas KD c-Src did not, suggesting that the Src kinase activity was required for the association of ADAP. Immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody also suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation of ADAP was dependent on Src kinase activity and essential for their association (Fig. 2A). Src kinase-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous ADAP was further confirmed by a retrovirus-mediated expression of the CA or KD variants of c-Src in RAW 264 cells (Fig. 2B). Because both the SH2 domain and the kinase activity of c-Src were found to be essential for the binding to ADAP, we tried to identify tyrosine residues responsible for this association in ADAP. First, two truncated forms of ADAP, which encoded amino acids 1–325 and 1–614, respectively, showed no binding to c-Src (Fig. 2C), suggesting the involvement of the carboxyl-terminal region of ADAP (amino acids 615–819) in the binding. Four tyrosine residues (Tyr615, Tyr687, Tyr791, and Tyr807), subsequently, were identified in the corresponding region as putative sites of phosphorylation by protein-tyrosine kinases using the prediction servers (NetPhos 2.0, Technical University of Denmark). Among these, 615 and 687 were already characterized as a recognition site of Fyn and SLP-76, respectively (35Raab M. Kang H. da Silva A. Zhu X. Rudd C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21170-21179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We substituted these four residues with phenylalanine in a combinatorial manner and examined the activity to bind c-Src. As shown in Fig. 2D, Tyr807 was found to be required for the binding. Tyr807, which resides in the extreme carboxyl terminus following the SH3-like domain, was identified here for the first time as the recognition site for ADAP partner proteins. Expression Profiles of ADAP and Association with c-Src in Osteoclast Precursors—We then examined the expression profile of ADAP in RAW264 cells and bone marrow macrophagess. Mononuclear precursor cells commit to differentiation after 24 h and start cell fusion after 48 h in RAW264 cell system (18Kumagai N. Ohno K. Tameshige R. Hoshijima M. Yogo K. Ishida N. Takeya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 758-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 25Ishida N. Hayashi K. Hoshijima M. Ogawa T. Koga S. Miyatake Y. Kumegawa M. Kimura T. Takeya T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41147-41156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). We previously reported that c-src was a RANKL-inducible gene and c-Src became detectable after 24 h in both types of cells (18Kumagai N. Ohno K. Tameshige R. Hoshijima M. Yogo K. Ishida N. Takeya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 758-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In contrast to the expression of c-src, that of ADAP was evident even in unstimulated cells through the pre-fusion stage, and decreased as cells proceeded to the multinuclear cell stage in both types of cells (Fig. 3A). The expression of the p130 isoform seemed to be more prominent in bone marrow macrophagess, unlike in RAW264 cells (Fig. 3A). These results suggested that ADAP could play a major role in mononuclear cells, rather than in mature osteoclasts. In fact, when ADAP was immunostained in cells, a clear signal was detected in mononuclear cells, whereas only a faint signal was detected in multinucleated cells (Fig. 3B). In cells at the pre-fusion stage, a strong signal for ADAP was identified particularly in the leading edge of lamellipodia and in pseudopodia (Fig. 3B). We then confirmed the association of endogenous c-Src with ADAP in differentiating cells. As shown in Fig. 4, the immunoprecipitation of c-Src implied the formation of a complex with ADAP in both RAW264 cells and osteoclast precursor cells prepared from bone marrow cells.Fig. 4Association of ADAP with c-Src in RAW264 cells and osteoclast precursors. c-Src was immunoprecipitated (IP) from lysates prepared from RAW264 cells (left panel) and osteoclast precursors from bone marrow cells (right panel). Western blotting (IB) was performed to detect ADAP (upper panel) and c-Src (lower panel). Normal mouse IgG was used for a control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Adhesion-dependent Phosphorylation of ADAP—Because Tyr phosphorylation was found to be critical for the association of ADAP with c-Src, we then examined how the phosphorylation of ADAP was controlled in cells, in particular the effect of adhesion to the substratum. As shown in Fig. 5A, ADAP was not phosphorylated at all in the suspension culture, whereas the tyrosine-phosphorylated form became evident under adhesive conditions. Moreover, when poly-d-lysine-coated plates were used instead of vitronectin-coated plates, the adhesion treatment did not induce the phosphorylation of ADAP, suggesting that this phosphorylation was integrin-dependent. Given the results showing its localization in Fig. 4, ADAP seemed to respond to and function in the cell adhesion/attachment process. We showed above that Tyr807 of ADAP was a major recognition site for c-Src. Therefore, if c-Src plays an important role in the integrin-dependent phosphorylation of ADAP, the phosphorylation of Tyr807 was expected to be modulated in response to cell adhesion. When this was examined using RAW264 cells expressing wild type or variants of ADAP, the elevation of Tyr phosphorylation was actually evident in wild type and Tyr807-containing ADAP under adhesive conditions, whereas the phosphorylation was significantly reduced in the Tyr807-substituted variant or in all forms under suspension conditions (Fig. 5B). Suppression of ADAP by siRNA Impairs Multinucleated Cell Formation and Cell Migration—We examined the functional role of ADAP in osteoclast precursors. To this end, we suppressed the expression of ADAP in RAW264 cells using siRNA for ADAP (Fig. 6A), and measured the MN cell formation. As a result, among siRNA-treated cells, few MN cells were detected (Fig. 6B). Because the expression of ADAP was mainly detected in pre-fusion cells, these results further suggested that ADAP plays an important role during the progression to MN cell formation. This phenotype was similar to that observed when the c-src expression was suppressed using antisense Src, in that the formation of functional MN cells with mineral hydrolyzing activity was significantly suppressed (18Kumagai N. Ohno K. Tameshige R. Hoshijima M. Yogo K. Ishida N. Takeya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 758-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We then measured its effect on cell migration activity with a time-lapse video system using parental RAW264 cells and ADAP-knockdown cells (Fig. 7). More than 60% of parental RAW264 cells migrated at 20–40 μm/h, whereas more than 70"
