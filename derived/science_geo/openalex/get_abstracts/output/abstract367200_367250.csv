https://openalex.org/W1979032223,"Programmed necrosis is a form of caspase-independent cell death whose molecular regulation is poorly understood. The kinase RIP1 is crucial for programmed necrosis, but also mediates activation of the prosurvival transcription factor NF-kappaB. We postulated that additional molecules are required to specifically activate programmed necrosis. Using a RNA interference screen, we identified the kinase RIP3 as a crucial activator for programmed necrosis induced by TNF and during virus infection. RIP3 regulates necrosis-specific RIP1 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of RIP1 and RIP3 stabilizes their association within the pronecrotic complex, activates the pronecrotic kinase activity, and triggers downstream reactive oxygen species production. The pronecrotic RIP1-RIP3 complex is induced during vaccinia virus infection. Consequently, RIP3(-/-) mice exhibited severely impaired virus-induced tissue necrosis, inflammation, and control of viral replication. Our findings suggest that RIP3 controls programmed necrosis by initiating the pronecrotic kinase cascade, and that this is necessary for the inflammatory response against virus infections."
https://openalex.org/W2052605153,"Smac mimetics induce apoptosis synergistically with TNF-α by triggering the formation of a caspase-8-activating complex containing receptor interacting protein kinase-1 (RIPK1). Caspase inhibitors block this form of apoptosis in many types of cells. However, in several other cell lines, caspase inhibitors switch the apoptotic response to necrosis. A genome wide siRNA screen revealed another member of the RIP kinase family, RIP3, to be required for necrosis. The expression of RIP3 in different cell lines correlates with their responsiveness to necrosis induction. The kinase activity of RIP3 is essential for necrosis execution. Upon induction of necrosis, RIP3 is recruited to RIPK1 to form a necrosis-inducing complex. Embryonic fibroblasts from RIP3 knockout mice are resistant to necrosis and RIP3 knockout animals are devoid of inflammation inflicted tissue damage in an acute pancreatitis model. These data indicate RIP3 as the determinant for cellular necrosis in response to TNF-α family of death-inducing cytokines."

In this study, we investigated the efficacy of a miRNA replacement therapy for liver cancer. We demonstrate that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells exhibit reduced expression of miR-26a, a miRNA that is normally expressed at high levels in diverse tissues. Expression of this miRNA in liver cancer cells in vitro induces cell-cycle arrest associated with direct targeting of cyclins D2 and E2. Systemic administration of this miRNA in a mouse model of HCC using adeno-associated virus (AAV) results in inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, induction of tumor-specific apoptosis, and dramatic protection from disease progression without toxicity. These findings suggest that delivery of miRNAs that are highly expressed and therefore tolerated in normal tissues but lost in disease cells may provide a general strategy for miRNA replacement therapies.

These findings suggest that delivery of miRNAs that are highly expressed and therefore tolerated in normal tissues but lost in disease cells may provide a general strategy for miRNA replacement therapies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a diverse class of highly conserved small RNA molecules that function as critical regulators of gene expression in multicellular eukaryotes and some unicellular eukaryotes (Kato and Slack, 2008Kato M. Slack F.J. microRNAs: small molecules with big roles—C. elegans to human cancer.Biol. Cell. 2008; 100: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). miRNAs are initially transcribed as long primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that undergo sequential processing by the RNase III endonucleases Drosha and Dicer to yield the mature ∼20–23 nucleotide species (Kim, 2005Kim V.N. MicroRNA biogenesis: coordinated cropping and dicing.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar). Mature miRNAs associate with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and interact with sites of imperfect complementarity in 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs. Targeted transcripts subsequently undergo accelerated turnover and translational repression (Valencia-Sanchez et al., 2006Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Liu J. Hannon G.J. Parker R. Control of translation and mRNA degradation by miRNAs and siRNAs.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). Importantly, the ability of individual miRNAs to regulate hundreds of transcripts allows these RNAs to coordinate complex programs of gene expression and thereby induce global changes in cellular physiology. Indeed, a growing body of evidence has documented that miRNAs provide functions essential for normal development and cellular homeostasis and, accordingly, dysfunction of these molecules has been linked to several human diseases (Kloosterman and Plasterk, 2006Kloosterman W.P. Plasterk R.H. The diverse functions of microRNAs in animal development and disease.Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar). Over the last 5 years, a particularly important role for miRNAs in cancer pathogenesis has emerged. Virtually all examined tumor types are characterized by globally abnormal miRNA expression patterns (Calin and Croce, 2006Calin G.A. Croce C.M. MicroRNA signatures in human cancers.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 857-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar). Profiles of miRNA expression are highly informative for tumor classification, prognosis, and response to therapy. Moreover, recent results have documented a functional contribution of specific miRNAs to cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. For example, miRNAs are known targets of genomic lesions that frequently activate oncogenes and inactivate tumor suppressors in cancer cells, such as amplification, deletion, and epigenetic silencing (Calin et al., 2004Calin G.A. Sevignani C. Dumitru C.D. Hyslop T. Noch E. Yendamuri S. Shimizu M. Rattan S. Bullrich F. Negrini M. Croce C.M.

USA. 2006; 103: 9136-9141Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Additionally, miRNAs provide critical functions downstream of classic oncogenic and tumor suppressor signaling pathways such as those controlled by Myc and p53 (Chang et al., 2008Chang T.C. Yu D. Lee Y.S. Wentzel E.A. Arking D.E. West K.M. Dang C.V. Thomas-Tikhonenko A. Mendell J.T. Widespread microRNA repression by Myc contributes to tumorigenesis.Nat.

Mendell J.T. c-Myc-regulated microRNAs modulate E2F1 expression.Nature. 2005; 435: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar). Finally, functional studies have directly documented the potent pro- and antitumorigenic activity of specific miRNAs both in vitro and in vivo (Ventura and Jacks, 2009Ventura A. Jacks T. MicroRNAs and cancer: short RNAs go a long way.Cell. 2009; 136: 586-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). As a consequence of the important functions provided by miRNAs in cancer cells, potential therapeutic approaches that target this pathway have recently attracted attention. Although significant focus in this area has been directed toward antisense-mediated inhibition of oncogenic miRNAs (Love et al., 2008Love T.M. Moffett H.F. Novina C.D.

The utility of LNA in microRNA-based cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.Semin. Cancer Biol. 2008; 18: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), several lines of evidence suggest that miRNA replacement represents an equally viable, if not more efficacious, strategy. Although specific miRNAs are often overexpressed in cancer cells, most miRNAs are downregulated in tumors (Gaur et al., 2007Gaur A. Jewell D.A. Liang Y. Ridzon D. Moore J.H. Chen C. Ambros V.R. Israel M.A. Characterization of microRNA expression levels and their biological correlates in human cancer cell lines.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 2456-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, Lu et al., 2005Lu J. Getz G. Miska E.A. Alvarez-Saavedra E. Lamb J. Peck D. Sweet-Cordero A. Ebert B.L. Mak R.H. Ferrando A.A. et al.MicroRNA expression profiles classify human cancers.Nature. 2005; 435: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (7741) Google Scholar). Global miRNA repression enhances cellular transformation and tumorigenesis in both in vitro and in vivo models (Kumar et al., 2007Kumar M.S. Lu J. Mercer K.L. Golub T.R. Jacks T. Impaired microRNA processing enhances cellular transformation and tumorigenesis.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar), underscoring the protumorigenic effects of miRNA loss-of-function. Moreover, we have previously demonstrated that hyperactivity of Myc, a common occurrence in diverse tumor types, leads to widespread miRNA repression (Chang et al., 2008Chang T.C. Yu D. Lee Y.S. Wentzel E.A. Arking D.E. West K.M. Dang C.V. Thomas-Tikhonenko A. Mendell J.T. Widespread microRNA repression by Myc contributes to tumorigenesis.Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Enforced expression of individual miRNAs in lymphoma cells transformed by Myc or other oncogenes dramatically suppresses tumorigenesis. These observations suggest that re-expression of even a single miRNA in tumor cells could provide significant therapeutic benefit. Supporting this notion, two recent reports demonstrated that viral delivery of let-7 miRNAs suppressed tumor growth in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma (Esquela-Kerscher et al., 2008Esquela-Kerscher A. Trang P. Wiggins J.F. Patrawala L. Cheng A. Ford L. Weidhaas J.B. Brown D. Bader A.G. Slack F.J. The let-7 microRNA reduces tumor growth in mouse models of lung cancer.Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 759-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, Kumar et al., 2008Kumar M.S. Erkeland S.J. Pester R.E. Chen C.Y. Ebert M.S. Sharp P.A. Jacks T. Suppression of non-small cell lung tumor development by the let-7 microRNA family.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 3903-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Importantly, let-7 directly targets KRAS, the initiating oncogene in this tumor model (Johnson et al., 2005Johnson S.M. Grosshans H. Shingara J. Byrom M. Jarvis R. Cheng A. Labourier E. Reinert K.L. Brown D. Slack F.J. RAS is regulated by the let-7 microRNA family.Cell. 2005; 120: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar). Thus, the utility of miRNAs as more general anticancer therapeutics in situations where they do not target the initiating oncogene remains to be studied. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third-leading cause of death from cancer and the fifth most common malignancy worldwide (Roberts, 2008Roberts L.R. Sorafenib in liver cancer–just the beginning.N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 359: 420-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, Thorgeirsson and Grisham, 2002Thorgeirsson S.S. Grisham J.W. Molecular pathogenesis of human hepatocellular carcinoma.Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). HCC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage when it is no longer amenable to curative therapies. Highly active drug-metabolizing pathways and multidrug resistance transporter proteins in tumor cells further diminish the efficacy of current therapeutic regimens for this cancer type. Alternative approaches are therefore needed to overcome these barriers to successful therapy. Fortunately, the liver is well-suited for such alternative strategies since it is easily targeted by both viral and nonviral gene and small-molecule delivery systems (Alexander et al., 2008Alexander I.E. Cunningham S.C. Logan G.J. Christodoulou J. Potential of AAV vectors in the treatment of metabolic disease.Gene Ther. 2008; 15: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, Pathak et al., 2008Pathak A. Vyas S.P. Gupta K.C. Nano-vectors for efficient liver specific gene transfer.Int. J. Nanomedicine. 2008; 3: 31-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this regard, gene therapy vectors based on adeno-associated virus (AAV) are particularly promising. Recent advances in AAV vector technology include a self-complementary genome that enhances therapeutic gene expression and nonhuman primate AAV serotypes that facilitate efficient transduction following vascular delivery. Significantly, these improvements allow 90%–100% transduction of hepatocytes and long-term gene expression without toxicity following a single systemic administration of recombinant virus (McCarty et al., 2003McCarty D.M.

Rapid and highly efficient transduction by double-stranded adeno-associated virus vectors in vitro and in vivo.Gene Ther. 2003; 10: 2105-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Because of their small size, regulatory RNAs are especially amenable to AAV-mediated delivery. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that miRNAs can be used as general anticancer therapeutics through their effects on tumor cell proliferation and death even when they do not target the initiating oncogene. We reasoned that the most therapeutically useful miRNAs would be expressed at low levels in tumors but would be highly expressed, and therefore tolerated, in normal tissues. miR-26a fulfills these criteria, exhibiting high expression in normal adult liver but low expression in both human and murine liver tumors. miR-26a directly downregulates cyclins D2 and E2 and induces a G1 arrest in human liver cancer cells in vitro. AAV-mediated miR-26a delivery potently suppresses cancer cell proliferation and activates tumor-specific apoptosis in vivo, resulting in dramatic suppression of tumor progression without toxicity. These findings provide proof-of-concept support for systemic delivery of tumor-suppressing miRNAs as a powerful and highly specific anticancer therapeutic modality. We previously demonstrated that Myc activation in B cell lymphoma models results in downregulation of a large cohort of miRNAs, including miR-15a/16, miR-26a, miR-34a, miR-150, and miR-195 (Chang et al., 2008Chang T.C. Yu D. Lee Y.S. Wentzel E.A. Arking D.E. West K.M. Dang C.V. Thomas-Tikhonenko A. Mendell J.T. Widespread microRNA repression by Myc contributes to tumorigenesis.Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Enforced expression of these specific miRNAs dramatically inhibits B cell lymphomagenesis. To extend these findings to a solid tumor model and to investigate the potential use of these miRNAs as anticancer therapeutics, we studied their expression in a previously described model of liver cancer in which mice harboring a tetracycline (tet)–repressible MYC transgene (tet-o-MYC) are crossed with mice expressing the tet-transactivator protein (tTA) driven by the liver activator promoter (LAP) (Beer et al., 2004Beer S. Zetterberg A. Ihrie R.A. McTaggart R.A. Yang Q. Bradon N. Arvanitis C. Attardi L.D. Feng S. Ruebner B. et al.Developmental context determines latency of MYC-induced tumorigenesis.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e332Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, Felsher and Bishop, 1999Felsher D.W. Bishop J.M. Reversible tumorigenesis by MYC in hematopoietic lineages.Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 199-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, Shachaf et al., 2004Shachaf C.M. Kopelman A.M. Arvanitis C. Karlsson A. Beer S. Mandl S. Bachmann M.H. Borowsky A.D. Ruebner B. Cardiff R.D. et al.MYC inactivation uncovers pluripotent differentiation and tumour dormancy in hepatocellular cancer.Nature. 2004; 431: 1112-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Upon removal of doxycycline (dox), bi-transgenic animals express MYC specifically in the liver and subsequently develop liver tumors resembling HCC with complete penetrance. We sought miRNAs that are highly expressed and therefore tolerated in normal tissues but are expressed at reduced levels in tumors. Such miRNAs might exhibit antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects that are restricted to cancer cells. Northern blotting revealed that miR-26a, and to a lesser extent miR-15a and miR-16, fulfilled these criteria, exhibiting high expression in normal liver from adult mice lacking the LAP-tTA transgene (harboring an inactive tet-o-MYC transgene) but low expression in liver tumors from tet-o-MYC, LAP-tTA bi-transgenic animals (Figure 1A). Notably, these miRNAs did not exhibit reduced expression in normal-appearing liver from bi-transgenic animals, consistent with the previous demonstration that Myc levels are only minimally increased in nontumor tissue in these mice (Shachaf et al., 2004Shachaf C.M. Kopelman A.M. Arvanitis C. Karlsson A. Beer S. Mandl S. Bachmann M.H. Borowsky A.D. Ruebner B. Cardiff R.D. et al.MYC inactivation uncovers pluripotent differentiation and tumour dormancy in hepatocellular cancer.Nature. 2004; 431: 1112-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Additional miRNAs with antitumorigenic activity in B lymphoma cells were expressed at approximately equivalent levels in normal liver and tumors (miR-195, Figure 1A) or were not detectable in these tissues (miR-150, data not shown). miR-34a was strongly upregulated in liver tumors (Figure 1A), perhaps reflecting its regulation by p53, which is retained and active in some tumors in these animals (Beer et al., 2004Beer S. Zetterberg A. Ihrie R.A. McTaggart R.A. Yang Q. Bradon N. Arvanitis C. Attardi L.D. Feng S. Ruebner B. et al.Developmental context determines latency of MYC-induced tumorigenesis.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e332Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, He et al., 2007bHe L. He X. Lowe S.W. Hannon G.J. microRNAs join the p53 network–another piece in the tumour-suppression puzzle.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). As expected, miR-17 was expressed at high levels in liver tumors, consistent with our previous demonstration that the miR-17-92 cluster is directly transactivated by Myc (O'Donnell et al., 2005O'Donnell K.A. Wentzel E.A. Zeller K.I. Dang C.V. Mendell J.T. c-Myc-regulated microRNAs modulate E2F1 expression.Nature. 2005; 435: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar). Because miR-26a exhibited the most dramatic downregulation in liver tumors in bi-transgenic animals, we further examined its expression in a panel of human HCC samples. Consistent with the mouse tumor data, miR-26a was expressed at statistically significantly lower levels in human tumors compared to normal human liver tissue (Figure 1B). Paired normal liver biopsy material was available for a subset of the HCC samples. Seven of eight of these samples showed reduced miR-26a expression relative to the associated normal liver control (Figure 1C). On the basis of these results from human and mouse liver tumors, we selected miR-26a for functional studies to evaluate its anti-tumorigenic properties and potential therapeutic utility for liver cancer in vitro and in vivo. As an initial test of the antiproliferative properties of miR-26a in liver cancer cells, we utilized a murine stem cell virus (MSCV)–derived retroviral construct to enforce expression of this miRNA in HepG2 cells. As controls for this experiment, we used viruses that express miR-18a, a component of the protumorigenic miR-17-92 cluster, and miR-34a, which is known to have potent antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity in other cell lines (Bommer et al., 2007Bommer G.T.

Northern blotting demonstrated that miR-26a expression levels in HepG2 cells closely mirror expression levels in tumors from tet-o-MYC; LAP-tTA animals (Figure 2A). Infection with MSCV-miR-26a results in enforced expression of this miRNA at a level comparable to that observed in normal liver tissue. Flow cytometric analysis of retrovirally infected cell populations revealed fewer cells in S phase and increased numbers of cells in G1 following infection with MSCV-miR-26a or MSCV-miR-34a, compared with cells infected with MSCV-empty or MSCV-miR-18a, suggesting that miR-26a and miR-34a induce a G1 arrest (Figure 2B). To more accurately quantify the numbers of cells arrested in G1, we treated cells with the microtubule-destabilizing agent nocodazole, which traps cycling cells in M phase. Cell populations with enforced miR-26a or miR-34a expression were characterized by significantly increased numbers of cells remaining in G1 (Figure 2C), confirming that these miRNAs arrest the cell cycle at this stage. To investigate the mechanisms through which miR-26a induces a G1 cell-cycle arrest, we examined predicted targets of this miRNA using the Targetscan algorithm (Grimson et al., 2007Grimson A. Farh K.K. Johnston W.K. Garrett-Engele P. Lim L.P. Bartel D.P. MicroRNA targeting specificity in mammals: determinants beyond seed pairing.Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 91-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). This analysis predicts that miR-26a regulates cyclin E1 (CCNE1), cyclin E2 (CCNE2), cyclin D2 (CCND2), and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6), all of which play a critical role in transition through the G1-S checkpoint (Vermeulen et al., 2003Vermeulen K. Van Bockstaele D.R. Berneman Z.N. The cell cycle: a review of regulation, deregulation and therapeutic targets in cancer.Cell Prolif. 2003; 36: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Western blotting was used to determine whether miR-26a represses any of these putative targets in retrovirally infected cell populations. Although infection with MSCV-miR-26a did not affect the abundance of cyclin E1 and CDK6 (data not shown), significantly reduced levels of cyclin D2 and cyclin E2 were observed in cells with enforced miR-26a expression (Figures 3A and 3B). Both CCND2 and CCNE2 have single predicted binding sites in their 3′ UTRs that are highly conserved in mammals and, in the case of CCND2, present in chicken (Figures 3C and 3D). To verify that these transcripts are directly regulated by miR-26a, reporter plasmids were constructed in which portions of the 3′ UTRs encompassing the predicted binding sites, with or without mutations that would disrupt miRNA interaction, were cloned downstream of a luciferase open reading frame. When introduced into HepG2 cells, constructs with intact miR-26a binding sites were expressed at significantly lower levels than the mutant constructs, consistent with direct functional interaction of endogenously expressed miR-26a with these sites (Figures 3E and 3F). Cotransfection of reporter plasmids with a synthetic miR-26a mimic further repressed luciferase activity produced from wild-type, but not mutant, reporter constructs. Demonstrating the specificity of these effects, cotransfection with a miR-18a mimic actually diminished downregulation of the wild-type reporters, possibly by competing for limiting miRNA pathway components and thereby relieving the transcript from repression. These data document that miR-26a directly represses expression of cyclin D2 and cyclin E2, providing one mechanism through which this miRNA arrests cell-cycle progression. Having demonstrated that miR-26a potently arrests proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro, we next initiated a series of experiments to assess whether systemic delivery of this miRNA could be used as a therapeutic strategy for this tumor type in vivo. The tet-o-MYC; LAP-tTA liver cancer model represents an ideal setting for these studies. Because these mice were constructed with a human MYC transgene that includes its 3′ UTR (Felsher and Bishop, 1999Felsher D.W. Bishop J.M. Reversible tumorigenesis by MYC in hematopoietic lineages.Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 199-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), we first confirmed that miR-26a does not regulate MYC itself. MYC is not a predicted target of miR-26a according to several commonly used algorithms including Targetscan, miRanda, and PicTar (Betel et al., 2008Betel D. Wilson M. Gabow A. Marks D.S. Sander C.

Manual inspection of the human MYC 3′ UTR further documents the absence of even a minimal hexamer complementary to the miR-26a seed sequence. Western blotting confirms that retroviral expression of miR-26a in HepG2 cells does not affect Myc protein abundance (see Figure S1 available online). Thus, miR-26a does not target the initiating oncogene in tet-o-MYC; LAP-tTA mice, supporting the use of this model for assessing the general tumor suppressing properties of miR-26a in vivo. The development of self-complementary AAV (scAAV) vectors and the availability of AAV serotypes for improved transduction of specific target tissues has expanded the usefulness of this virus for therapeutic gene delivery (Gao et al., 2002Gao G.P.

In particular, these advances allow highly efficient transduction of hepatocytes following systemic administration of scAAV8 vectors. We therefore constructed a scAAV vector system to evaluate the therapeutic potential of miR-26a in tet-o-MYC; LAP-tTA mice. To allow facile assessment of target tissue transduction, the vector included enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) driven by the ubiquitously expressed elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1α) promoter. Moreover, since miRNAs are frequently embedded within introns of both protein-coding and noncoding primary transcripts, we cloned miR-26a into the short intron that is part of the EF1α promoter unit (Wakabayashi-Ito and Nagata, 1994Wakabayashi-Ito N.

https://openalex.org/W2085442981,"Allelic loss of the essential autophagy gene beclin1 occurs in human cancers and renders mice tumor-prone suggesting that autophagy is a tumor-suppression mechanism. While tumor cells utilize autophagy to survive metabolic stress, autophagy also mitigates the resulting cellular damage that may limit tumorigenesis. In response to stress, autophagy-defective tumor cells preferentially accumulated p62/SQSTM1 (p62), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones, damaged mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and genome damage. Moreover, suppressing ROS or p62 accumulation prevented damage resulting from autophagy defects indicating that failure to regulate p62 caused oxidative stress. Importantly, sustained p62 expression resulting from autophagy defects was sufficient to alter NF-κB regulation and gene expression and to promote tumorigenesis. Thus, defective autophagy is a mechanism for p62 upregulation commonly observed in human tumors that contributes directly to tumorigenesis likely by perturbing the signal transduction adaptor function of p62-controlling pathways critical for oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2034458870,"The Notch pathway is a highly conserved signaling system that controls a diversity of growth, differentiation, and patterning processes. In growing blood vessels, sprouting of endothelial tip cells is inhibited by Notch signaling, which is activated by binding of the Notch receptor to its ligand Delta-like 4 (Dll4). Here, we show that the Notch ligand Jagged1 is a potent proangiogenic regulator in mice that antagonizes Dll4-Notch signaling in cells expressing Fringe family glycosyltransferases. Upon glycosylation of Notch, Dll4-Notch signaling is enhanced, whereas Jagged1 has weak signaling capacity and competes with Dll4. Our findings establish that the equilibrium between two Notch ligands with distinct spatial expression patterns and opposing functional roles regulates angiogenesis, a mechanism that might also apply to other Notch-controlled biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2034689767,"Behavioral flexibility is the hallmark of goal-directed behavior. Whereas a great deal is known about the neural substrates of behavioral adjustment when it is explicitly cued by features of the external environment, little is known about how we adapt our behavior when such changes are made on the basis of uncertain evidence. Using a Bayesian reinforcement-learning model and fMRI, we show that frontopolar cortex (FPC) tracks the relative advantage in favor of switching to a foregone alternative when choices are made voluntarily. Changes in FPC functional connectivity occur when subjects finally decide to switch to the alternative behavior. Moreover, interindividual variation in the FPC signal predicts interindividual differences in effectively adapting behavior. By contrast, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) encodes the relative value of the current decision. Collectively, these findings reveal complementary prefrontal computations essential for promoting short- and long-term behavioral flexibility."
https://openalex.org/W2117091532,"The mature capsids of HIV and other retroviruses organize and package the viral genome and its associated enzymes for delivery into host cells. The HIV capsid is a fullerene cone: a variably curved, closed shell composed of approximately 250 hexamers and exactly 12 pentamers of the viral CA protein. We devised methods for isolating soluble, assembly-competent CA hexamers and derived four crystallographically independent models that define the structure of this capsid assembly unit at atomic resolution. A ring of six CA N-terminal domains form an apparently rigid core, surrounded by an outer ring of C-terminal domains. Mobility of the outer ring appears to be an underlying mechanism for generating the variably curved lattice in authentic capsids. Hexamer-stabilizing interfaces are highly hydrated, and this property may be key to the formation of quasi-equivalent interactions within hexamers and pentamers. The structures also clarify the molecular basis for capsid assembly inhibition and should facilitate structure-based drug design strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2053855385,"Delta and mu opioid receptors (DORs and MORs) are inhibitory G protein-coupled receptors that reportedly cooperatively regulate the transmission of pain messages by substance P and TRPV1-expressing pain fibers. Using a DOReGFP reporter mouse we now show that the DOR and MOR are, in fact, expressed by different subsets of primary afferents. The MOR is expressed in peptidergic pain fibers, the DOR in myelinated and nonpeptidergic afferents. Contrary to the prevailing view, we demonstrate that the DOR is trafficked to the cell surface under resting conditions, independently of substance P, and internalized following activation by DOR agonists. Finally, we show that the segregated DOR and MOR distribution is paralleled by a remarkably selective functional contribution of the two receptors to the control of mechanical and heat pain, respectively. These results demonstrate that behaviorally relevant pain modalities can be selectively regulated through the targeting of distinct subsets of primary afferent pain fibers."
https://openalex.org/W2152783224,"Staphylococcus aureus infections are associated with abscess formation and bacterial persistence; however, the genes that enable this lifestyle are not known. We show here that following intravenous infection of mice, S. aureus disseminates rapidly into organ tissues and elicits abscess lesions that develop over weeks but cannot be cleared by the host. Staphylococci grow as communities at the center of abscess lesions and are enclosed by pseudocapsules, separating the pathogen from immune cells. By testing insertional variants in genes for cell wall-anchored surface proteins, we are able to infer the stage at which these molecules function. Fibrinogen-binding proteins ClfA and ClfB are required during the early phase of staphylococcal dissemination. The heme scavenging factors IsdA and IsdB, as well as SdrD and protein A, are necessary for abscess formation. Envelope-associated proteins, Emp and Eap, are either required for abscess formation or contribute to persistence. Fluorescence microscopy revealed Eap deposition within the pseudocapsule, whereas Emp was localized within staphylococcal abscess communities. Antibodies directed against envelope-associated proteins generated vaccine protection against staphylococcal abscess formation. Thus, staphylococci employ envelope proteins at discrete stages of a developmental program that enables abscess formation and bacterial persistence in host tissues.—Cheng, A. G., Kim, H.

Hair graying, a typical sign of aging in mammals, is caused by the incomplete maintenance of melanocyte stem cells (MSCs) with age. Here, we report that irreparable DNA damage, as caused by ionizing radiation, abrogates renewal of MSCs in mice. Surprisingly, the DNA-damage response triggers MSC differentiation into mature melanocytes in the niche, rather than inducing their apoptosis or senescence. The resulting MSC depletion leads to irreversible hair graying. Furthermore, deficiency of Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a central transducer kinase of the DNA-damage response, sensitizes MSCs to ectopic differentiation, demonstrating that the kinase protects MSCs from their premature differentiation by functioning as a ""stemness checkpoint"" to maintain the stem cell quality and quantity."
https://openalex.org/W2021045663,"Background Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are potential vectors of chikungunya virus (CHIKV). The recent CHIKV outbreaks were caused by a new variant characterized by a mutation in the E1 glycoprotein gene (E1-226V) which has favored a better transmissibility by Ae. albopictus. As Ae. albopictus tends to replace Ae. aegypti in many regions, one question remained: is Ae. albopictus as efficient as Ae. aegypti to transmit the variant E1-226V of CHIKV? Methodology and Findings We infected orally both species with the variant E1-226V and estimated the infection, the viral dissemination, and the transmission rate by real time RT-PCR. Additionally, we used an in vitro assay to determine the amount of virus delivered by mosquitoes in their saliva. We found that Ae. aegypti as well as Ae. albopictus ensured a high replication of the virus which underwent an efficient dissemination as detectable in the salivary glands at day 2 post-infection (pi). Infectious CHIKV particles were delivered by salivary glands from day 2 with a maximum at day 6 pi for Ae. albopictus (103.3 PFU) and day 7 pi for Ae. aegypti (102.5 PFU). Conclusions Ae. albopictus is slightly more efficient than Ae. aegypti to transmit the variant E1-226V of CHIKV. These results will help to design an efficient vector control to limit transmission as soon as the first human cases are diagnosed."
https://openalex.org/W2087715700,"An activity-dependent change in synaptic efficacy is a central tenet in learning, memory, and pathological states of neuronal excitability. The lateral diffusion dynamics of neurotransmitter receptors are one of the important parameters regulating synaptic efficacy. We report here that neuronal activity modifies diffusion properties of type-A GABA receptors (GABA(A)R) in cultured hippocampal neurons: enhanced excitatory synaptic activity decreases the cluster size of GABA(A)Rs and reduces GABAergic mIPSC. Single-particle tracking of the GABA(A)R gamma2 subunit labeled with quantum dots reveals that the diffusion coefficient and the synaptic confinement domain size of GABA(A)R increases in parallel with neuronal activity, depending on Ca(2+) influx and calcineurin activity. These results indicate that GABA(A)R diffusion dynamics are directly linked to rapid and plastic modifications of inhibitory synaptic transmission in response to changes in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration. This transient activity-dependent reduction of inhibition would favor the onset of LTP during conditioning."
https://openalex.org/W2036483895,"Development in multicellular organisms requires the organized generation of differences. A universal mechanism for creating such differences is asymmetric cell division. In plants, as in animals, asymmetric divisions are correlated with the production of cellular diversity and pattern; however, structural constraints imposed by plant cell walls and the absence of homologs of known animal or fungal cell polarity regulators necessitates that plants utilize new molecules and mechanisms to create asymmetries. Here, we identify BASL, a novel regulator of asymmetric divisions in Arabidopsis. In asymmetrically dividing stomatal-lineage cells, BASL accumulates in a polarized crescent at the cell periphery before division, and then localizes differentially to the nucleus and a peripheral crescent in self-renewing cells and their sisters after division.

During asymmetric divisions, cells divide to create daughters that differ in size, location, and cellular components. This division mechanism is commonly used during development to establish cell fate, to provide spacing, and, as recent studies have emphasized, to create and maintain stem cell populations (Horvitz and Herskowitz, 1992Horvitz H.R.

Both intrinsic and extrinsic elements contribute to asymmetric divisions. Intrinsic mechanisms include the asymmetric position of the mitotic spindle and segregation of cell fate determinants via conserved apically and basally restricted cortical complexes in animal cells (Goldstein and Macara, 2007Goldstein B.

Extrinsic factors may orient the cell division relative to larger patterning elements in the tissue or organ, such as the Wnt-mediated signals from neighbor cells that specify body axes (Goldstein et al., 2006Goldstein B.

Cell. 2006; 10: 391-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In plants, asymmetric divisions are correlated with the early pattern of the embryo, with the creation of tissue layers (the cortex and endodermis in the root, for example), and with the generation of cell type diversity and pattern during postembryonic development (Ten Hove and Heidstra, 2008Ten Hove C.A. Heidstra R. Who begets whom? Plant cell fate determination by asymmetric cell division.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2008; 11: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For many of these developmental events, there is clear evidence for extrinsic signals that orient or create asymmetries (Fowler and Quatrano, 1997Fowler J.E. Quatrano R.S.

Some of these signaling mechanisms are plant specific, such as the use of mobile transcription factors to establish radial identities during root development (Nakajima et al., 2001Nakajima K. Sena G. Nawy T. Benfey P.N. Intercellular movement of the putative transcription factor SHR in root patterning.Nature. 2001; 413: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Segregated cell fate determinants or other intrinsic factors akin to those found in animal asymmetric divisions, however, have not been definitively shown to exist in plants. This is not entirely unexpected. Plant cells are surrounded by a rigid cell wall, and their division planes are not determined by mitotic spindle orientation; therefore, asymmetric partitioning of components to daughter cells is likely to require different mechanisms than those employed in animal cells (Scheres and Benfey, 1999Scheres B.

We sought to identify intrinsic elements of plant asymmetric divisions by using stomatal development as a model. Stomata are structures that mediate gas exchange between the plant and atmosphere and consist, minimally, of two sister epidermal cells (guard cells, GCs) and the pore between them (Bergmann and Sack, 2007Bergmann D.C. Sack F.D. Stomatal development.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2007; 58: 163-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Both the differentiation of stomatal GCs and their overall patterned distribution in the epidermis are correlated with asymmetric and oriented cell divisions (Figure 1A) (Bergmann and Sack, 2007Bergmann D.C. Sack F.D. Stomatal development.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2007; 58: 163-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, the specialized stomatal cell lineage begins with the physically asymmetric division of a young epidermal cell (meristemoid mother cell, MMC) to create a meristemoid and a stomatal lineage ground cell (SLGC) as its smaller and larger daughters, respectively (Figure 1A). The meristemoid is a stomatal precursor, but it represents only the first step toward stomatal differentiation; meristemoids may complete up to three self-renewing asymmetric divisions before differentiating into guard mother cells (GMCs). A GMC undergoes a single symmetric division to become the paired GCs of a stoma. SLGCs may differentiate into pavement cells, or may also become MMCs, creating secondary meristemoids through asymmetric divisions at later times (Figure 1A). The divisions creating secondary meristemoids are not only asymmetric, but are also oriented to prevent the formation of adjacent stomata (Bergmann and Sack, 2007Bergmann D.C. Sack F.D. Stomatal development.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2007; 58: 163-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar).

Downstream of these regulators, however, virtually nothing is known about how stomatal lineage cells actually undergo asymmetric divisions.

We identified the recessive mutant basl-1 in a screen for stomatal pattern defects in seedlings. basl-1 mutants produce excessive numbers of small epidermal cells, and their stomata are found in a mispatterned (clustered) distribution (Figure 1C and quantified in Figure 1D).

Stomatal lineage cells in basl mutants also lack fate asymmetries; meristemoid fate marker MUTE::nucGFP (MacAlister et al., 2007MacAlister C.A. Ohashi-Ito K. Bergmann D.C.

We cloned BASL using a map-based approach (see details in the Experimental Procedures) and found that the basl-1 mutation is a C→T change leading to a premature stop in the coding region of At5g60880 (Figure 2A). Two additional insertional alleles that disrupt the locus, basl-2 (WiscDsLox264F02) and basl-3 (SAIL_547_F11) in the Col ecotype (Figure 2A), have indistinguishable phenotypes from basl-1, and basl-2 eliminates the BASL transcript (Figure 1D and Figure S1B available online). BASL encodes a novel protein with no recognizable homologs outside of plants. We find no obvious functional domains in the BASL protein sequence with the exception of a weak nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and nuclear export sequence (NES; Figures 2A and S1). BASL expression is highly correlated with that of stomatal lineage-expressed genes SPEECHLESS (SPCH) and TMM (Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.88 and 0.83, respectively) and is highest in the shoot meristem and young leaf samples of the AtGenExpress tissue series (Toufighi et al., 2005Toufighi K.

In the cotyledon and leaf epidermis, BASL::GUS is highly expressed in the asymmetrically dividing MMCs (arrowheads, Figure 2B) and meristemoids (arrows, Figure 2B), and it is present in their sisters at lower levels and decreases to below detection in later stomatal lineage cells (Figure 2B). BASL::GUS is also expressed in the plant vasculature (Figure S5A). BASL::GFP-BASL rescues the basl-2 (null) mutant phenotype and was used to monitor BASL protein localization (details are in the Experimental Procedures). BASL::GFP-BASL is first detected in nuclei of epidermal cells at 16 hr postgermination (hpg) (Figure S2D). This cell population includes both asymmetrically dividing cells and those of indeterminate identity. Later, when morphological identification of stomatal lineage cell types in the cotyledons is possible, BASL exhibits a striking pattern of subcellular localization correlated with asymmetric divisions; at 72 hpg, BASL is highly expressed in the nucleus of stomatal lineage cells (73/73, Figure 2C). In cells that exhibit the characteristic rounded-triangle morphology of meristemoids (32/73), BASL is exclusively nuclear (Figure 3A). In the remaining cells (presumptive MMCs, 41/73), BASL was also localized to the periphery in a strikingly polarized manner (arrowheads in Figure 2C). Accumulation at the peripheral site appeared before any obvious morphological asymmetry in these cells (Figure 3B). In polarized but premitotic MMCs, the peripheral BASL crescent is distal to the nucleus (Figure 3C). During mitosis, GFP-BASL also appears to be diffuse in the cell, but the asymmetric peripheral localization persists (Figure S3A). We observed BASL behavior in more than 500 cell pairs that had undergone an obvious asymmetric cell division (the smaller cell was <35% of the combined area of the sisters). Soon after an asymmetric cell division, when the new cell wall was immature (Figure 3D, arrow points to wall), BASL expression was observed at the periphery and in the nucleus of the SLGC. In cell pairs separated by a mature wall, the SLGC maintained its peripheral BASL, but nuclear BASL was faint (Figure 3E) or absent (Figure 3F). We confirmed that nuclear BASL was absent in SLGCs by optically sectioning through entire cells (Figures S2B and S2C). The peripheral BASL crescent was distal to the meristemoid (61/67), though rarely (6/67, Figure S2A) BASL was symmetrical around the SLGC periphery. We never observed BASL crescents adjacent to the meristemoid. In the meristemoid, nuclear-localized BASL remained visible until the meristemoid differentiated into a GMC (arrow in Figure 2C). Neither nuclear nor peripheral BASL expression was found in GMCs or guard cells, but mature SLGCs that become pavement cells can maintain their polarized peripheral localization of BASL (Figure S2E). We followed 140 individual cells or cell pairs over a 12 hr time period to monitor the dynamic behavior of BASL and its correlation with cell fate. We observed meristemoids expressing nuclear BASL differentiate into GMCs (Figures 3J, 3J′, 3L, and 3L′) and meristemoids expressing nuclear and diffuse BASL carry out another round of asymmetric cell division (Figures 3K and 3K′). SLGCs containing BASL peripheral crescents could lose their BASL expression as they expanded and became pavement cells (Figures 3J, 3J′, 3K, and 3K′) or retain both nuclear and peripheral BASL when they underwent spacing divisions to create secondary meristemoids (Figures 3L and 3L′). Because the divisions that create secondary meristemoids are oriented relative to extrinsic landmarks, (other stomatal lineage cells) (Geisler et al., 2000Geisler M. Nadeau J. Sack F.D. Oriented asymmetric divisions that generate the stomatal spacing pattern in Arabidopsis are disrupted by the too many mouths mutation.Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2075-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), we paid particular attention to BASL localization in cell pairs that had divided next to stomata. In these cells in the wild-type, the peripheral BASL crescents are located directly adjacent to the stomata (Figure 3G [20/20]). This localization pattern could result from BASL directly responding to extrinsic orienting signals from the stomata, or it could reflect the fact that both the stomata and BASL are distal to the new meristemoid. We tested whether BASL was responsive to extrinsic signals mediated by the putative receptor and ligand pair, TMM and EPF1, that orient MMC and meristemoid divisions (Hara et al., 2007Hara K. Kajita R. Torii K.U. Bergmann D.C. Kakimoto T.

Control of stomatal distribution on the Arabidopsis leaf surface.Science. 2002; 296: 1697-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In tmm and epf1 mutants, new meristemoids can form directly adjacent to stomata (Geisler et al., 2000Geisler M. Nadeau J. Sack F.D.

Control of stomatal distribution on the Arabidopsis leaf surface.Science. 2002; 296: 1697-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). We monitored the location of the peripheral GFP-BASL crescent in “correct” divisions (new meristemoid distal to stoma) and “incorrect” divisions (meristemoid adjacent). In the correct divisions (11/32 for epf1 and 17/49 for tmm), as in the wild-type, all BASL crescents were adjacent to the stoma (Figure 3H). In the incorrect divisions, the GFP-BASL crescent was adjacent to the stoma in only 6/21 (29%) of epf1 divisions and 13/32 (41%) of tmm divisions (Figure 3I), but this crescent was always distal to the new meristemoid (100% in both tmm and epf1). This pattern is most consistent with BASL marking an intrinsic polarity in the MMC division, not responding directly to a stomatal-derived signal. We also found that tmm-1;basl and epf1;basl double mutants exhibit additive phenotypes in cotyledons and leaves (Figures S4A–S4D) and that BASL::GFP-BASL maintains its dual nuclear and polarized peripheral localization in both the tmm and epf1 mutants (Figures S4E and S4F), further suggesting that BASL acts independently of these two genes. An interesting consequence of the BASL peripheral crescent always being distal to the meristemoid is that this pattern requires BASL to disappear from its original position and be reestablished at a new site in SLGCs (as seen in Figures 3L and 3L′). The striking dual localization of BASL prompted us to investigate whether specific regions of BASL mediated different localization patterns or functions. We created five deletion variants of BASL and expressed each GFP-tagged variant with the BASL promoter (Figure 4A). Stable T2 transformants of each variant were assayed for localization and function in wild-type and basl-2 backgrounds. We found distinct patterns of localization for the different BASL regions. Fragments containing the N-terminal region (BASL-N and BASL-NI) displayed strong nuclear localization in MMCs, meristemoids, and young SLGCs (Figure 4B). Fragments consisting of the internal region or the C-terminal region alone (BASL-I and BASL-C) did not direct GFP to any specific subcellular location, and GFP signal was diffuse in stomatal lineage cells (Figure 4C and data not shown). BASL-IC, a fragment containing both the internal and C-terminal regions, however, was sufficient to direct the reporter to a polarized region of the cell periphery (Figure 4D). The BASL-IC construct not only exhibited asymmetric localization, but, to the resolution of our assay, it was also sufficient to completely rescue the basl-2 mutant (Figures 4E and 4G). Neither the nuclear localized BASL-N and BASL-NI variants nor the cytoplasmic BASL-I and BASL-C rescued basl-2 (Figures 4F and 4H). These results indicate that the IC region is sufficient for BASL function. Because these results also suggested that the periphery is the primary site for BASL activity, we monitored BASL-IC throughout the cell cycle (Figure S3B). BASL-IC maintained its peripheral crescent throughout mitosis, but also appeared to be diffuse in the cytoplasm and colocalized with the phragmoplast and immature cell plate (Figure S3B). While BASL-IC was sufficient for rescue, BASL-I created a dominant-negative effect, producing plants with clustered stomata and extra cell divisions similar to those in the basl mutant (brackets in Figure 4C). In addition to the localization and rescue experiments that suggest that BASL functions at the periphery, we observed that BASL crescents correspond to areas of cell expansion. This is most clearly seen in SLGCs (examples in Figures 2C, 3E, and 3F), but we observed the same phenomenon throughout the stomatal lineage. To test whether BASL was sufficient to promote cell expansion, we overexpressed BASL with the strong, broadly expressed CMV35S promoter (35S::GFP-BASL). In 35S::GFP-BASL plants (n = 12 independent T2 lines), cells throughout the plant express BASL, but, strikingly, BASL localization at the periphery of these cells is still polarized (Figures 5B and 5C). Overexpression of BASL results in cellular outgrowth coincident with the region in which peripheral BASL is concentrated. This occurs in cells that grow by diffuse expansion (Figures 5B, 5C, and 5J), as well as in tip-growing cells such as root hairs (data not shown). The ectopic expansion phenotype is also seen when BASL-IC is expressed (Figures 5E and 5F), and in fact may be enhanced because BASL::BASL-IC also generates ectopic expansion phenotypes (7/14 lines) but BASL::BASL does not (0/39 lines). These data indicate that cells outside of the stomatal lineage have mechanisms for polarized BASL protein localization and that they can respond to BASL-mediated outgrowth, and suggests that the N terminus and/or nuclear localization negatively regulates BASL activity. BASL was initially identified by its role during the asymmetric divisions of stomatal development. Several observations about BASL reporter behavior are consistent, however, with BASL marking a more widely used polarity-generating system. Two well established systems that generate or mark cell polarities in plant are the Rho GTPases of plants (ROPs) and the PIN family of auxin transporters (reviewed in Feraru and Friml, 2008Feraru E. Friml J. PIN polar targeting.Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 1553-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, Fu et al., 2005Fu Y. Gu Y. Zheng Z. Wasteneys G. Yang Z.

We used the fact that BASL maintains its distinctive polarized pattern when ectopically expressed outside the stomatal lineage to investigate the relationships between BASL and these two classes of proteins. Localized outgrowth in pavement cells and in tip-growing cells is regulated by the ROPs and their associated proteins (Fu et al., 2002Fu Y. Li H. Yang Z.

Here, we show that retinoblastoma cells express markers of postmitotic cone precursors but not markers of other retinal cell types. We also demonstrate that human cone precursors prominently express MDM2 and N-Myc, that retinoblastoma cells require both of these proteins for proliferation and survival, and that MDM2 is needed to suppress ARF-induced apoptosis in cultured retinoblastoma cells. Interestingly, retinoblastoma cell MDM2 expression was regulated by the cone-specific RXRγ transcription factor and a human-specific RXRγ consensus binding site, and proliferation required RXRγ, as well as the cone-specific thyroid hormone receptor-β2. These findings provide support for a cone precursor origin of retinoblastoma and suggest that human cone-specific signaling circuitry sensitizes to the oncogenic effects of RB1 mutations.

These findings provide support for a cone precursor origin of retinoblastoma and suggest that human cone-specific signaling circuitry sensitizes to the oncogenic effects of RB1 mutations. Retinoblastoma is a childhood retinal tumor that has provided numerous insights into human cancer biology. For instance, retinoblastoma was one of the first malignancies to be recognized as having hereditary features, and it engendered the characterization of one of the first tumor suppressors genes to be cloned, RB1 (Weller, 1937Weller C.V. Intrinsic factors in the etiology of neoplasms.Am. J. Cancer. 1937; 30: 39-46Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar, Friend et al., 1986Friend S.H. Bernards R. Rogelj S. Weinberg R.A. Rapaport J.M. Albert D.M. Dryja T.P. A human DNA segment with properties of the gene that predisposes to retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma.Nature. 1986; 323: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). In turn, the retinoblastoma protein, Rb, was found to have crucial roles in cell-cycle control and differentiation, and to govern a signaling pathway that is inactivated in most if not all human cancers (Weinberg, 1995Weinberg R.A. The retinoblastoma protein and cell cycle control.Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4183) Google Scholar, Cobrinik, 2005Cobrinik D.

Regulation of cell lineage specification by the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5268-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, despite the general significance of Rb in cancer biology, the basis for its crucial role in retinoblastoma pathogenesis has not been defined. Retinoblastomas are thought to result from the inactivation of RB1, either with somatic inactivation of both RB1 alleles, or with a germline RB1 mutation and somatic inactivation of the second allele in hereditary cases. Biallelic RB1 mutations may initially result in the production of benign retinomas, with subsequent genetic changes mediating malignant transformation (Dimaras et al., 2008Dimaras H. Khetan V. Halliday W. Orlic M. Prigoda N.L. Piovesan B. Marrano P. Corson T.W. Eagle Jr., R.C. Squire J.A. et al.Loss of RB1 induces non-proliferative retinoma; increasing genomic instability correlates with progression to retinoblastoma.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Germline RB1 mutations predispose to an average of five retinoblastomas, usually bilaterally, and with most forming in the first year (Abramson and Gombos, 1996Abramson D.H. Gombos D.S. The topography of bilateral retinoblastoma lesions.Retina. 1996; 16: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but predispose to only an ∼0.5% chance of developing other cancers per year (Kleinerman et al., 2005Kleinerman R.A. Tucker M.A. Tarone R.E. Abramson D.H. Seddon J.M. Stovall M. Li F.P. Fraumeni Jr., J.F. Risk of new cancers after radiotherapy in long-term survivors of retinoblastoma: an extended follow-up.J. Clin. Oncol. 2005; 23: 2272-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The exceptionally high rate of retinoblastoma arising from the minuscule retinal cell population implies that the tumors derive from a cell type that is unusually sensitive to the loss of Rb function. One way that a cell may be sensitized to the loss of Rb is by having signaling circuitry that fails to respond to Rb loss with appropriate countermeasures. Indeed, at least two cellular responses to Rb loss impede tumorigenesis in other settings, but evidently fail to do so in the cells from which retinoblastomas arise. First, in diverse settings including explanted mouse retinas, Rb loss is compensated by increased expression of the Rb-related p107 (Donovan et al., 2006Donovan S.L. Schweers B. Martins R. Johnson D. Dyer M.A. Compensation by tumor suppressor genes during retinal development in mice and humans.BMC Biol. 2006; 4: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Second, loss of Rb can deregulate E2F transcription factors and elicit E2F-dependent apoptosis (Chen et al., 2007Chen D. Opavsky R. Pacal M. Tanimoto N. Wenzel P. Seeliger M.W. Leone G. Bremner R. Rb-mediated neuronal differentiation through cell-cycle-independent regulation of E2f3a.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e179Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Among other effects, deregulated E2Fs induce expression of a CDKN2A isoform that encodes ARF, which inhibits MDM2 and promotes p53-mediated apoptosis (Iaquinta and Lees, 2007Iaquinta P.J. Lees J.A. Life and death decisions by the E2F transcription factors.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). As Rb-deficient retinas and premalignant retinomas have greatly increased CDKN2AARF expression (Laurie et al., 2006Laurie N.A. Donovan S.L. Shih C.S. Zhang J. Mills N. Fuller C. Teunisse A. Lam S. Ramos Y. Mohan A. et al.Inactivation of the p53 pathway in retinoblastoma.Nature. 2006; 444: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, Chen et al., 2007Chen D. Opavsky R. Pacal M. Tanimoto N.

Halliday W. Orlic M. Prigoda N.L. Piovesan B. Marrano P. Corson T.W. Eagle Jr., R.C.

Genet. 2008; 17: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), it appears that the ARF-induced apoptotic response may be impaired in early stages of retinoblastoma tumorigenesis. To gain insight into the circuitry that sensitizes to Rb loss, we sought to relate features of retinoblastoma to human retinal development. As retinoblastomas form as early as 21 weeks of gestation (Maat-Kievit et al., 1993Maat-Kievit J.A. Oepkes D. Hartwig N.G. Vermeij-Keers C. van Kamp I.L. van de Kamp J.J. A large retinoblastoma detected in a fetus at 21 weeks of gestation.Prenat. Diagn. 1993; 13: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we initially sought clues to this circuitry by evaluating Rb's developmental expression pattern. We found that Rb is expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner in retinal progenitor cells, but is not evident in the early postmitotic precursors of the different retinal neurons. However, Rb was detected in older, maturing retinal precursors, and at exceptionally high levels in maturing cone precursor cells (Lee et al., 2006Lee T.C. Almeida D. Claros N. Abramson D.H. Cobrinik D. Cell cycle-specific and cell type-specific expression of Rb in the developing human retina.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 5590-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Rb's prominent expression in cone precursors was intriguing, as cultured retinoblastoma cells generally express cone markers (Bogenmann et al., 1988Bogenmann E. Lochrie M.A. Simon M.I. Cone cell-specific genes expressed in retinoblastoma.Science. 1988; 240: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but not glial markers as was once believed (Virtanen et al., 1988Virtanen I. Kivela T. Bugnoli M. Mencarelli C. Pallini V. Albert D.M. Tarkkanen A. Expression of intermediate filaments and synaptophysin show neuronal properties and lack of glial characteristics in Y79 retinoblastoma cells.Lab. Invest. 1988; 59: 649-656PubMed Google Scholar), and the tumors have cone but not rod phototransduction activities (Hurwitz et al., 1990Hurwitz R.L. Bogenmann E. Font R.L. Holcombe V. Clark D. Expression of the functional cone phototransduction cascade in retinoblastoma.J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1872-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, retinoblastomas are topographically distributed across the retina in a pattern that mimics that of L/M cones (Munier et al., 1994Munier F.L. Balmer A. van Melle G. Gailloud C. Radial asymmetry in the topography of retinoblastoma. Clues to the cell of origin.Ophthalmic Genet. 1994; 15: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the significance of the cone circuitry has been unclear, as cone features were not consistently detected in retinoblastomas in situ, and cells with properties of other retinal cell types are also present in the tumors (Gonzalez-Fernandez et al., 1992Gonzalez-Fernandez F. Lopes M.B. Garcia-Fernandez J.M. Foster R.G. De Grip W.J. Rosemberg S. Newman S.A. VandenBerg S.R. Expression of developmentally defined retinal phenotypes in the histogenesis of retinoblastoma.Am.

Moreover, mice with targeted loss of Rb and Rb-related proteins produced tumors with amacrine or horizontal cell, but not cone cell, features (Robanus-Maandag et al., 1998Robanus-Maandag E.

Thus, in the current study, we examined the relevance of cone-specific signaling circuitry to retinoblastoma tumorigenesis. To assess the cellular phenotypes of retinoblastoma cells, we stained a panel of tumors with retinal cell type-specific markers. The panel included tumors displaying a range of differentiation states, with and without prior chemotherapy, and from bilaterally and unilaterally affected patients (Table S1 available online). As mature photoreceptor features were previously detected in only a subset of retinoblastomas, we initially examined whether the tumors more generally express proteins that are characteristic of immature photoreceptor precursors. These included CRX, which is specific to cones, rods, and bipolar cells (Bibb et al., 2001Bibb L.C. Holt J.K. Tarttelin E.E. Hodges M.D. Gregory-Evans K. Rutherford A. Lucas R.J. Sowden J.C.

Genet. 2001; 10: 1571-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); RXRγ, which is specific to cones and ganglion cells (Mori et al., 2001Mori M. Ghyselinck N.B. Chambon P. Mark M. Systematic immunolocalization of retinoid receptors in developing and adult mouse eyes.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1312-1318PubMed Google Scholar); TRβ2, which is specific to cones (Ng et al., 2001Ng L. Hurley J.B. Dierks B. Srinivas M. Salto C. Vennstrom B. Reh T.A. Forrest D. A thyroid hormone receptor that is required for the development of green cone photoreceptors.Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar); and NRL, which is specific to rods (Swain et al., 2001Swain P.K. Hicks D. Mears A.J. Apel I.J. Smith J.E. John S.K. Hendrickson A. Milam A.H. Swaroop A. Multiple phosphorylated isoforms of NRL are expressed in rod photoreceptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36824-36830Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (Figures 1A–1D and S1). CRX, RXRγ, and TRβ2 were detected in the vast majority of cells in each of 40 tumors, including >95% of cells in ten quantitatively evaluated samples, whereas NRL generally was not detected (Figures 1E–1H and 1P, and Table S2). CRX, RXRγ, and TRβ2 were expressed in all tumor regions, and in morphologically differentiated cells as well as in proliferating cells that express Ki67 or phosphorylated histone H3 (Figures 1I–1L and data not shown). In keeping with their neoplastic status, CRX+, RXRγ+, and TRβ2+ tumor cells lacked detectable Rb (Figures 2A and 2B), whereas CRX+, RXRγ+, and TRβ2+ cone precursors in the central retina had prominent Rb expression (Figures 1A–1D and S1). In addition, the vast majority of cells in each of 22 retinoblastomas expressed cone-specific arrestin (Figures 1P and S2). As coexpression of CRX, RXRγ, TRβ2, and cone arrestin was indicative of a cone phenotype, we examined whether retinoblastoma cells resemble short wavelength-sensitive S cones, or the developmentally distinct long and medium wavelength-sensitive L/M cones, by staining 22 tumors for S and L/M opsins. L/M opsin was detected in >95% of cells in each of the tumors, including proliferating Ki67+ cells and each of ∼4000 CRX+ cells evaluated in a costaining analysis (Figures 1M, 1P, and S3). In contrast, S opsin was detected in only 0.1%–2% of cells in 16 (73%) of the samples, and always in cells that coexpressed L/M opsin (Figures 1N and 1P). As S and L/M opsins are transiently coexpressed in developing L/M but not S cones (Cornish et al., 2004Cornish E.E. Xiao M. Yang Z. Provis J.M. Hendrickson A.E.

Eye Res. 2004; 78: 1143-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Figure 1O), these findings indicate that retinoblastomas largely consist of cells that have an L/M cone precursor phenotype. We next examined whether retinoblastoma cells also express markers of retinal neurons other than cones. In these analyses, we costained samples for cell type-specific markers and for Rb, in order to identify nonneoplastic Rb+ cells. We detected no tumor cells expressing the amacrine and horizontal cell-specific syntaxin, the ganglion cell-specific Brn-3b, or the horizontal, amacrine, bipolar, and progenitor cell-specific Prox1 (Table S2). Occasional tumors had clusters of cells that expressed the retinal progenitor cell- and bipolar cell-specific Chx10 or the progenitor, ganglion, horizontal, amacrine, or pigment epithelium cell-specific Pax6. However, the Chx10+ and Pax6+ cells coexpressed Rb (Figure S4) and were concluded to derive from the normal retina. Similarly, a cluster of cells expressing the rod-specific rhodopsin was detected in one tumor, yet these cells also coexpressed Rb (Figure S4). One sample had a highly differentiated retinoma-like region in which the majority of cells expressed cone markers and <1% expressed rhodopsin (Figure S5). However, these cells also seemed to be nonneoplastic, as no rhodopsin+ cells costained for Ki67. Thus, in this series, neoplastic retinoblastoma cells expressed markers of cones but not other retinal neurons. We also examined retinoblastomas for expression of glial and progenitor cell markers. Each of 20 tumors had cells that coexpressed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and nestin (Table S2). The vast majority of these cells coexpressed Rb (Figures 2A–2F), consistent with their being nonneoplastic astrocytes or Müller glia. However, Rb was not detected in rare GFAP+ cells (Figure 2K), or in rare cells that lacked both GFAP and the cone marker CRX (Figures 2A–2C, arrowhead). To assess whether the rare CRX−,Rb− or GFAP+,Rb− cells derive from RB1-mutated tumor cells, we examined whether they retained wild-type RB1 alleles. We first identified tumors in which one of the RB1 alleles was deleted, then immunostained and recorded the positions of CRX−,Rb− and GFAP+,Rb− cells, and then defined their RB1 status using two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for RB1 (at 13q14) and for a 13q34 locus that served as a FISH positive control. As expected, nearly all (89% ± 7.6%) CRX+,Rb− retinoblastoma cells had one RB1 hybridization signal, and nearly all (88% ± 8.9%) nonneoplastic CRX−,Rb+ cells had two RB1 signals (Figures 2G–2I and 2M). The lack of RB1 signal in ∼10% of CRX+,Rb− cells, and the presence of only one RB1 signal in ∼10% of CRX−,Rb+ cells (Figure 2M), reflects the limited sensitivity of the FISH assay. Importantly, nearly all (93% ± 2.2%) CRX−,Rb− cells in both tumors also had two RB1 signals (Figure 2M). The similar proportion of CRX−,Rb+ and CRX−,Rb− cells with two RB1 signals implied that most, and potentially all, of the CRX− cells retained two RB1 alleles. Many of these may be microglia, as all tumors had cells that expressed the CD68 marker, and approximately one-half of these lacked detectable Rb (Table S2 and Figure S6). Similarly, GFAP+,Rb− cells generally had two RB1 signals (Figures 2J–2L). In summary, Rb− cells that lacked the cone-related CRX, or that expressed the glial marker GFAP, generally had two RB1 alleles and were nonneoplastic, whereas Rb− cells that expressed CRX retained one RB1 allele and were the neoplastic component. While the above studies showed that retinoblastoma cells generally express cone markers, it remained possible that rare cells that lack a cone phenotype might propagate the tumors. To address this possibility, we serially engrafted primary retinoblastomas to the subretinal space of nude mice (Figure 3A), and examined the propagation of cone-like and non-cone-like cells, using human nuclear antigen (HuNu) as a human cell marker. As expected, virtually all cells in the original human tumors were HuNu+. ∼2.7% of the cells lacked CRX (Figures 3B and 3C), of which the majority were likely to be glia and other nonneoplastic cells as described above. Engrafting this population resulted in tumors that had human HuNu+,CRX+ tumor cells and mouse HuNu−,CRX− cells, but no HuNu+,CRX− cells among an estimated more than 8000 cells examined (Figure 3C). Secondary grafts produced tumors of similar size, in which each of at least 8000 HuNu+ cells expressed CRX, TRβ2, RXRγ, and L/M opsin (Figures 3B and 3C and data not shown), implying that cone-specific proteins were expressed in each of at least 32,000 engrafted cells. Likewise, cells from secondary grafts produced similar-sized tumors in tertiary grafts, and cells from tertiary grafts produced tumors in a fourth round. Although cone markers were detected in each of ∼32,000 engrafted cells, re-engraftment of as few as 100 cells generated tumors in three out of four eyes. Tumors also developed after engrafting two retinoblastomas that consisted entirely of cone-like L/M opsin+ cells after 2 months in culture. In these cultures, CRX, TRβ2, RXRγ, and L/M opsin were detected in each of at least 8000 HuNu+ cells, and tumors developed after engrafting 1000 cells (the least attempted) in each of four eyes (Figure S7). Thus, two approaches with three tumors demonstrated that cone precursor-like cells propagate retinoblastoma in an orthologous site. While the above studies showed that cone markers were prominent in human retinoblastomas, amacrine and horizontal cell markers were prominent in mouse retinal tumors that resulted from loss of Rb and Rb-related proteins (Robanus-Maandag et al., 1998Robanus-Maandag E.

To address this discrepancy, we compared retinal cell marker expression in tumors from the two species. In this analysis, the cone markers CRX and TRβ2 were highly expressed in human retinoblastomas but not detected in Rb/p130-deficient mouse tumors, whereas the horizontal and amacrine markers Pax6 and syntaxin were prominent in the mouse tumors but not detected in human retinoblastomas (Figures 4A, 4B, and S8). The cone phenotype of human but not mouse retinal tumors was notable given that Rb was prominent in maturing human cone precursors (Lee et al., 2006Lee T.C. Almeida D. Claros N. Abramson D.H. Cobrinik D. Cell cycle-specific and cell type-specific expression of Rb in the developing human retina.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 5590-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) but was not detected in immature mouse cone precursors from E14 to P5, nor in mature mouse cones (Spencer et al., 2005Spencer C. Pajovic S. Devlin H. Dinh Q.D. Corson T.W. Gallie B.L. Distinct patterns of expression of the RB gene family in mouse and human retina.Gene Expr. Patterns. 2005; 5: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, and data not shown). Thus, we determined whether Rb was induced during human but not mouse cone maturation, by evaluating human foveae at fetal week 18 (which follows the onset of L/M opsin expression at week 14.5 but precedes emergence of inner and outer segments [Hendrickson and Provis, 2006Hendrickson A. Provis J. Comparison of development of the primate fovea centralis with peripheral retina.in: Sernagor E. Eglen S. Harris B. Wong R. Retinal Development. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2006: 126-149Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar]) and mouse retinas at P8, P12, and P16 (which brackets the onset of M opsin expression and the emergence of cone outer segments at P11 [Szel et al., 1993Szel A. Rohlich P. Mieziewska K. Aguirre G. van Veen T. Spatial and temporal differences between the expression of short- and middle-wave sensitive cone pigments in the mouse retina: a developmental study.J. Comp. Neurol. 1993; 331: 564-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar]). In a side-by-side comparison, there was an intense Rb signal in human TRβ2+ cone precursors but only a faint signal in mouse cone precursors, whereas Rb signals were similar in human and mouse Müller and bipolar cells (Figures 4C, 4D, and S9). Thus, Rb appeared to be robustly expressed during the postmitotic maturation of human but not mouse cones, correlating with the L/M cone phenotype of human but not mouse retinal tumors. We also detected Rb in mouse Prox1+ amacrine and horizontal cells at P12 and P42, in horizontal but not amacrine cells at P5, yet in neither cell type at P0. However, the Rb signal in these cells did not exceed that of Müller cells (Figure S10 and data not shown). Thus, in contrast to the situation in humans, mouse retinal tumors are jointly suppressed by Rb and Rb-related proteins and resemble retinal cell types that have relatively modest Rb expression. The retinoblastoma cone precursor phenotype and the Rb expression pattern suggested that Rb might have an antiproliferative role in cone precursor cells. We reasoned that if Rb was required to prevent proliferation, then cone precursors might have features that impede the E2F- and ARF-mediated apoptotic responses that often accompany the loss of Rb function. To address this possibility, we examined human retinas for expression of MDM2, which can abrogate E2F- and ARF-mediated responses by inhibiting p53 (Kowalik et al., 1998Kowalik T.F. DeGregori J. Leone G. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. E2F1-specific induction of apoptosis and p53 accumulation, which is blocked by Mdm2.Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 113-118PubMed Google Scholar, Lomazzi et al., 2002Lomazzi M. Moroni M.C. Jensen M.R. Frittoli E. Helin K. Suppression of the p53- or pRB-mediated G1 checkpoint is required for E2F-induced S-phase entry.Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), using an antibody (SMP14) that is specific to full-length p53-binding MDM2 isoforms. Remarkably, MDM2 was highly expressed in foveal cone precursors at gestational weeks 16, 18, and 21 (Figures 5A, 5B, and 5I and data not shown). The MDM2 signal diminished in progressively more peripheral and less mature cone precursors (Figures 5F–5I), suggesting that MDM2 levels increase during cone cell maturation. Concordantly, MDM2 was prominent in mature cones in tumor-associated retinas from retinoblastoma patients, including cones in the far periphery (Figures 5C, 5D, and S11). MDM2 was detected at lower levels in horizontal cells but generally was not detected in other retinal cell types (Figure 5J and data not shown). MDM2 was also highly expressed in each of eight retinoblastomas (Figure 5E), despite that each of the tumors had a near diploid MDM2 copy number (Figure S12). We next examined MDM2 expression in mouse retinas, wherein combined loss of Rb1 and related genes appears to elicit amacrine or horizontal cell tumors. Little or no MDM2 was detected in immature cones from E14 to P5, in maturing cone precursors at P8, P12, and P16, or in mature cones at P42 (Figures 5K and 5M and data not shown). While we cannot rule out that the lack of Mdm2 signal in mouse cones results from epitope masking, this seems unlikely as Mdm2 was readily detected in Prox1+ horizontal cells and at lower levels in Prox1+ amacrine cells at P14 and P42, as well as in the Prox1+ tumor cells in Rb/p130-deficient mice (Figures 5K–5O). However, Mdm2 was not detected in immature amacrine or horizontal cells at E14 or P0 (data not shown). Thus, MDM2 was highly expressed in the human and mouse cells that resemble the retinal tumors in the two species, and particularly during their postmitotic maturation. As tumorigenesis requires proliferative as well as survival signaling, we also examined whether postmitotic cone precursors express proliferation-related proteins. While human cone precursors lacked detectable E2F1 and cyclins D1, A2, and B, they highly expressed N-Myc. N-Myc was prominent in perifoveal cone precursors at weeks 16 and 18, and in more peripheral positions at weeks 18 and 21 (Figures 5P–5S and data not shown) but was not detected in mature cones of the postnatal human retina or in mouse cone precursors at P0, P5, or P12 (data not shown). The N-Myc staining appeared to be specific, as two N-Myc antibodies stained cone precursor nuclei in similar retinal positions (data not shown). N-Myc was also prominent in each of eight retinoblastomas that had a near diploid MYCN copy number (Figures 5T and S12). The prominent expression of MDM2 and N-Myc in"

Even Drosophila larvae are able to form and recall an association of a given odor with an aversive or appetitive gustatory reinforcer. As the Drosophila larva has turned into a particularly simple model for studying odor processing, a detailed neuronal and functional map of the olfactory pathway is available up to the third order neurons in the mushroom bodies. At this point, a convergence of olfactory processing and gustatory reinforcement is suggested to underlie associative memory formation. The dopaminergic system was shown to be involved in mammalian and insect olfactory conditioning. To analyze the anatomy and function of the larval dopaminergic system, we first characterize dopaminergic neurons immunohistochemically up to the single cell level and subsequent test for the effects of distortions in the dopamine system upon aversive (odor-salt) as well as appetitive (odor-sugar) associative learning. Single cell analysis suggests that dopaminergic neurons do not directly connect gustatory input in the larval suboesophageal ganglion to olfactory information in the mushroom bodies. However, a number of dopaminergic neurons innervate different regions of the brain, including protocerebra, mushroom bodies and suboesophageal ganglion. We found that dopamine receptors are highly enriched in the mushroom bodies and that aversive and appetitive olfactory learning is strongly impaired in dopamine receptor mutants. Genetically interfering with dopaminergic signaling supports this finding, although our data do not exclude on naïve odor and sugar preferences of the larvae. Our data suggest that dopaminergic neurons provide input to different brain regions including protocerebra, suboesophageal ganglion and mushroom bodies by more than one route. We therefore propose that different types of dopaminergic neurons might be involved in different types of signaling necessary for aversive and appetitive olfactory memory formation respectively, or for the retrieval of these memory traces. Future studies of the dopaminergic system need to take into account such cellular dissociations in function in order to be meaningful."
https://openalex.org/W2069890177,"Synaptic vesicles loaded with neurotransmitters fuse with the plasma membrane to release their content into the extracellular space, thereby allowing neuronal communication. The membrane fusion process is mediated by a conserved set of SNARE proteins: vesicular synaptobrevin and plasma membrane syntaxin and SNAP-25. Recent data suggest that the fusion process may be subject to regulation by local lipid metabolism. Here, we have performed a screen of lipid compounds to identify positive regulators of vesicular synaptobrevin. We show that sphingosine, a releasable backbone of sphingolipids, activates synaptobrevin in synaptic vesicles to form the SNARE complex implicated in membrane fusion. Consistent with the role of synaptobrevin in vesicle fusion, sphingosine upregulated exocytosis in isolated nerve terminals, neuromuscular junctions, neuroendocrine cells and hippocampal neurons, but not in neurons obtained from synaptobrevin-2 knockout mice. Further mechanistic insights suggest that sphingosine acts on the synaptobrevin/phospholipid interface, defining a novel function for this important lipid regulator."
https://openalex.org/W2034465871,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been postulated as a super-metabolic regulator, thought to exert numerous effects on skeletal muscle function, metabolism, and enzymatic signaling. Despite these assertions, little is known regarding the direct role(s) of AMPK in vivo, and results obtained in vitro or in situ are conflicting. Using a chronically catheterized mouse model (carotid artery and jugular vein), we show that AMPK regulates skeletal muscle metabolism in vivo at several levels, with the result that a deficit in AMPK activity markedly impairs exercise tolerance. Compared with wild-type littermates at the same relative exercise capacity, vascular glucose delivery and skeletal muscle glucose uptake were impaired; skeletal muscle ATP degradation was accelerated, and arterial lactate concentrations were increased in mice expressing a kinase-dead AMPKalpha2 subunit (alpha2-KD) in skeletal muscle. Nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) activity was significantly impaired at rest and in response to exercise in alpha2-KD mice; expression of neuronal NOS (NOSmicro) was also reduced. Moreover, complex I and IV activities of the electron transport chain were impaired 32 +/- 8 and 50 +/- 7%, respectively, in skeletal muscle of alpha2-KD mice (p < 0.05 versus wild type), indicative of impaired mitochondrial function. Thus, AMPK regulates neuronal NOSmicro expression, NOS activity, and mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle. In addition, these results clarify the role of AMPK in the control of muscle glucose uptake during exercise. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that AMPK is central to substrate metabolism in vivo, which has important implications for exercise tolerance in health and certain disease states characterized by impaired AMPK activation in skeletal muscle."

We further show that the human elongating glycylase has lost enzymatic activity due to two amino acid changes, suggesting that the functions of protein glycylation could be sufficiently fulfilled by monoglycylation. Depletion of a glycylase in Drosophila using RNA interference results in adult flies with strongly decreased total glycylation levels and male sterility associated with defects in sperm individualization and axonemal maintenance.

Polyglycylation is a posttranslational modification that generates side chains of glycine on the γ-carboxyl groups of specific glutamate residues of target proteins (Bré et al., 1998Bré M.H.

Similarly to polyglutamylation (Eddé et al., 1990Eddé B. Rossier J. Le Caer J.P. Desbruyères E. Gros F. Denoulet P.

While polyglutamylation was observed on many different types of microtubules (MTs), polyglycylation is particularly prominent in cilia and flagella and is mostly found in cells that possess these organelles (Bré et al., 1996Bré M.H.

Functional experiments on tubulin glycylation were difficult to perform since the modifying enzymes were unknown. Initial insights into the potential function of polyglycylation were obtained using modification-specific antibodies. For example, anti-glycylation antibodies affected axoneme beating in vitro, suggesting that tubulin polyglycylation could regulate ciliary dynein (Bré et al., 1996Bré M.H. Redeker V. Quibell M.

In Tetrahymena, the elimination of the major glycylation sites on β-tubulin was lethal or led to severe axonemal defects, including short axoneme size, absence of the central pair MTs, and incomplete outer doublet MTs (Redeker et al., 2005Redeker V.

Here we describe the discovery of a group of enzymes that catalyze tubulin glycylation and show that some of these enzymes have non-tubulin substrates. We demonstrate that glycylases are members of the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) family, which already contains three types of known amino acid ligases, the tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL; Ersfeld et al., 1993Ersfeld K.

We show that in mouse, TTLL3 and TTLL8 proteins are initiating glycylases with different substrate specificities, whereas TTLL10 is the elongating polyglycylase. In mammals, cooperation of these two types of enzymes generates polyglycine side chains in mammals, whereas in Drosophila, bifunctional enzymes catalyze both reactions. We also demonstrate that the previously reported absence of long glycine side chains on human sperm tubulin (Bré et al., 1996Bré M.H. Redeker V. Quibell M. Darmanaden-Delorme J. Bressac C. Cosson J. Huitorel P. Schmitter J.M. Rossier J. Johnson T. et al.Axonemal tubulin polyglycylation probed with two monoclonal antibodies: widespread evolutionary distribution, appearance during spermatozoan maturation and possible function in motility.J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 727-738PubMed Google Scholar) is caused by two inactivating amino acid substitutions in human TTLL10. Finally, we show by RNA interference (RNAi) that depletion of one of the two glycylases in Drosophila leads to strong reduction in polyglycylation, which causes defects in sperm maturation and results in male sterility. Moreover, expression of interfering RNA under a stronger promoter is lethal in early developmental stages. This suggests that polyglycylation is important for whole organism development in Drosophila. The identification of additional substrates of glycylation indicates that this modification could have a broad range of functions. Our study was initiated with the hypothesis that tubulin glycylases, like two other types of tubulin amino acid ligases, TTL (Ersfeld et al., 1993Ersfeld K. Wehland J. Plessmann U. Dodemont H.

Within the mammalian TTLL family, TTLL3, 8, 10, and 12 remained uncharacterized. According to phylogenetic studies, the TTLL12 gene is present in species that appear to lack glycylation (Janke et al., 2005Janke C. Rogowski K. Wloga D. Regnard C. Kajava A.V. Strub J.-M.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 431-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and murine TTLL12 has no glycylation activity in vivo and in vitro (K.R., unpublished data). In contrast, the presence of orthologs of TTLL3, 8, and 10 in genomes of diverse species (Janke et al., 2005Janke C. Rogowski K. Wloga D. Regnard C. Kajava A.V. Strub J.-M. Temurak N. van Dijk J.

Van Dorsselaer A. et al.Tubulin polyglutamylase enzymes are members of the TTL domain protein family.Science. 2005; 308: 1758-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) correlates with the known presence of tubulin glycylation, and a recent study showed that one of these three genes, TTLL10, encodes a glycylase for NAPs (Ikegami et al., 2008Ikegami K. Horigome D. Mukai M. Livnat I. MacGregor G.R. Setou M. TTLL10 is a protein polyglycylase that can modify nucleosome assembly protein 1.FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 1129-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To test whether mouse TTLL3, 8, and 10 have a tubulin glycylase activity, we expressed the respective cDNAs (van Dijk et al., 2007van Dijk J. Rogowski K. Miro J. Lacroix B. Eddé B. Janke C. A targeted multienzyme mechanism for selective microtubule polyglutamylation.Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 437-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) in HEK293 cells and tested the cell extracts in an in vitro MT glycylation assay. To distinguish between two possible types of activities, initiation (addition of the first glycine to a γ-carboxyl group of the target glutamate residue) and elongation of glycine side chains, we used substrates differing in the levels of tubulin glycylation: MTs polymerized from brain tubulin (that lack detectable glycylation) and strongly glycylated MTs of ciliary axonemes of Tetrahymena thermophila. Both TTLL3 and 8 promoted incorporation of [3H]-glycine into brain MTs but had very low activity on axonemal MTs. In contrast, TTLL10 was almost inactive on brain MTs but promoted efficient [3H]-glycine incorporation into axonemal MTs (Figure 1A). These observations suggest that TTLL3 and 8 are initiating glycylases, whereas TTLL10 is an elongating glycylase (polyglycylase) for tubulin. A similar functional specialization has been previously observed among polyglutamylases (van Dijk et al., 2007van Dijk J. Rogowski K. Miro J. Lacroix B. Eddé B. Janke C. A targeted multienzyme mechanism for selective microtubule polyglutamylation.Mol.

Redeker V. Duan J. et al.Glutamylation on alpha-tubulin is not essential but affects the assembly and functions of a subset of microtubules in Tetrahymena thermophila.Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 1362-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We also examined the selectivity of the enzymes for α- and β-tubulin. TTLL3 and 8 modified both α- and β-tubulin of brain MTs, with TTLL8 showing preference for α-tubulin (Figure 1A). For TTLL10, which modified only axonemal MTs, two-dimensional electrophoresis was used to separate axonemal α- and β-tubulin. Using anti-α- or β-tubulin antibodies as well as TAP952 (an antibody that recognizes monoglycylated sites on tubulins; Bré et al., 1998Bré M.H. Redeker V. Vinh J. Rossier J. Levilliers N. Tubulin polyglycylation: differential posttranslational modification of dynamic cytoplasmic and stable axonemal microtubules in Paramecium.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2655-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we found that both tubulin subunits of Tetrahymena axonemes are monoglycylated and thus are potential substrates for the elongation reaction. However, TTLL10 incorporated [3H]-glycine mainly into α-tubulin (Figure 1B). Next, we expressed TTLL3, 8, and 10 in U2OS cells and labeled the cells with antibodies that are specific to either mono- or polyglycylation: TAP952 and polyG (polyG specifically recognizes polyglycine chains; Duan and Gorovsky, 2002Duan J. Gorovsky M.A. Both carboxy-terminal tails of alpha- and beta-tubulin are essential, but either one will suffice.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 313-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), respectively (Figure 1C). Nontransfected U2OS cells show no reactivity with either of these two antibodies (arrowheads). After expression of TTLL3 or 8, we detected specific labeling of MTs with TAP952 but not with polyG. Thus, TTLL3 and 8 mediate initiation of glycine side chains on MTs in vivo but not side chain elongation. In contrast, cells expressing TTLL10 alone showed no labeling with TAP952 but had a diffuse labeling with polyG that did not correspond to MTs. This suggests that TTLL10 adds polyglycine chains directly onto proteins that are not associated with MTs, while it cannot modify MTs without prior monoglycylation. To test whether the two types of mammalian glycylases can function in a cooperative manner to create long side chains on MTs, we co-overexpressed either TTLL3 or 8 together with TTLL10 in U2OS cells. In both cases, we observed a strong labeling of MTs with the polyG antibody (Figure 2A). These results indicate that MTs have acquired polyglycine side chains, which was not the case when TTLL3, 8, or TTLL10 were expressed alone (Figure 1C). On immunoblots, the monoglycylation-specific antibody TAP952 detected strong signals in the tubulin region upon expression of TTLL3 or 8 alone. Additional protein bands were labeled after TTLL8 expression, suggesting that TTLL8 can mediate glycylation of other non-tubulin proteins (Figure 2B). TTLL3 increased glycylation of mostly β-tubulin in U2OS cells, while it promoted modification of both α- and β-tubulin in the in vitro assay (Figures 2B and 1A). Thus, it appears that the substrate preferences of the glycylating enzymes change depending on additional factors. Neither TTLL3 nor TTLL8 alone generated polyG-reactive epitopes, indicating that they are indeed restricted to reactions that generate monoglycine side chains (Figure 2B). In contrast, no TAP952 labeling was detected in extracts of cells expressing TTLL10. However, a strong polyG signal was induced on two distinct protein bands, one of them the size of α-tubulin (Figure 2B). We demonstrate that the substrate in the tubulin region corresponds to NAPs. First, two-dimensional immunoblot analysis shows that the polyglycylated 50 kDa protein band superimposes with NAPs but not with tubulins (Figure 2C), and second, ectopically expressed NAP1-EYFP and NAP2-EYFP were strongly polyglycylated by TTLL10 (Figure S1 available online). This is in agreement with the results of Ikegami et al., 2008Ikegami K. Horigome D. Mukai M. Livnat I. MacGregor G.R. Setou M. TTLL10 is a protein polyglycylase that can modify nucleosome assembly protein 1.FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 1129-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar and indicates that in contrast to tubulins, NAPs can be polyglycylated directly by TTLL10. After coexpression of TTLL3 or 8 with TTLL10, no TAP952 labeling was detected, whereas several protein bands were labeled with the polyG antibody. Virtually all protein bands labeled with TAP952 after expression of TTLL3 or 8 alone became labeled with polyG when TTLL10 was coexpressed (Figure 2B), suggesting that following monoglycylation by TTLL3 or 8, TTLL10 elongates glycine side chains of all major substrates of the initiating enzymes. The efficiency of this process is illustrated by the reduction of monoglycylated epitopes below detectable levels. This further indicates that the substrate specificity of polyglycylation in mammals is predetermined by the specificity of the initiating glycylases rather than by the specificity of elongating enzymes, except for proteins that are directly modified by TTLL10, such as the NAPs. Human sperm axonemes, unlike sperm axonemes of several other mammalian species studied so far, have side chains limited to monoglycylation (Bré et al., 1996Bré M.H. Redeker V. Quibell M. Darmanaden-Delorme J. Bressac C. Cosson J. Huitorel P. Schmitter J.M. Rossier J. Johnson T. et al.Axonemal tubulin polyglycylation probed with two monoclonal antibodies: widespread evolutionary distribution, appearance during spermatozoan maturation and possible function in motility.J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 727-738PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed this by comparing the status of glycylation in protein extracts prepared from mouse, rhesus monkey, and human sperm using the TAP952 and the polyG antibody (Figure 3A). Several mouse and rhesus protein bands were strongly labeled with polyG, while only weak signals were detected with TAP952. In contrast, human sperm proteins were not labeled with polyG but strongly with TAP952. No differences between the three species were found for the related tubulin modification, polyglutamylation (Figure 3A, panel polyE). To determine the molecular basis for the lack of elongated polyglycine chains in human sperm, we investigated the only known elongating glycylase in mammals, TTLL10. First, we confirmed the presence of a full-length mRNA by cloning TTLL10 from human testes cDNA. We then expressed human, mouse, and rhesus TTLL10 in U2OS cells. The mouse and rhesus TTLL10 generated polyglycylation that could be specifically detected with polyG, whereas the human protein was inactive (Figure 3B). Accordingly, when cell extracts from HEK293 cells overexpressing the respective TTLL10 proteins were used for in vitro assays, only the mouse and rhesus, but not the human, TTLL10 mediated incorporation of [3H]-glycine into axonemal MTs (Figure 3C). Domain-swapping experiments localized the inactivating mutations to the central region of human TTLL10, which corresponds to the highly conserved core TTL domain (Figures S3, S4A, and S4B; van Dijk et al., 2007van Dijk J. Rogowski K. Miro J. Lacroix B. Eddé B. Janke C. A targeted multienzyme mechanism for selective microtubule polyglutamylation.Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 437-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Within this domain, human and rhesus TTLL10 differ by 11 amino acids, out of which 4 are not evolutionarily conserved. Thus, we analyzed the remaining 7 amino acid changes by introducing them separately into the rhesus TTLL10. Two of these mutations led to a complete loss of polyglycylase activity (Figures S3 and S4C), suggesting that the corresponding amino acids are essential for activity. When these two mutations in human TTLL10 were both reverted to the conserved amino acids found in rhesus and mouse, the enzyme recovered polyglycylase activity (Figures 3D and 3E). This was not the case if only one mutation was reverted. As neither of the two mutations has been found in the genomes of the great apes (not shown), it appears that humans are unique in having lost the polyglycylation activity of TTLL10. One of the two inactivating mutations (mut3) is polymorphic in the human population, leading to a high incidence (55.0% heterozygote and 16.7% homozygote) of TTLL10 alleles without mut3 in the sub-Saharan African population, whereas 91.7% of the European population are homozygous for the presence of mut3 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=1320571). No polymorphism was found for mut5. To investigate if the mut3 polymorphism could affect the enzymatic activity of TTLL10, we compared polyglycylation of sperm proteins from two homozygote individuals either with or without mut3 but both bearing mut5 (Figure S5A). The complete absence of polyglycylation on sperm proteins from both individuals (Figure S5B) confirmed that the presence of one of the two inactivating mutations is sufficient for the complete loss of enzymatic activity of human TTLL10 (Figure S4C). In conclusion, we show that the human elongating glycylase TTLL10 is functionally inactive due to two mutations, resulting in the absence of polyglycylation in sperm. Considering that all known amino acid ligases that modify tubulin are members of the TTLL family, and that all TTLLs are expressed in testes (Ersfeld et al., 1993Ersfeld K. Wehland J. Plessmann U. Dodemont H. Gerke V. Weber K. Characterization of the tubulin-tyrosine ligase.J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, van Dijk et al., 2007van Dijk J. Rogowski K.

Cell. 2007; 26: 437-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), it is likely that TTLL10 is the only polyglycylating enzyme in mammals. Thus, humans could be a unique mammalian species that lacks protein polyglycylation. In a recently published screen for putative cancer-associated genes, TTLL3 obtained a relatively high score as a potential cancer gene (Sjöblom et al., 2006Sjöblom T. Jones S. Wood L.D. Parsons D.W. Lin J. Barber T.D. Mandelker D. Leary R.J. Ptak J. Silliman N. et al.The consensus coding sequences of human breast and colorectal cancers.Science. 2006; 314: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2844) Google Scholar). It was striking that the two mutations identified in the screen were localized in the vicinity of the ATP-binding residue E662, which is essential for enzymatic activity in all TTLLs (Figure 4A; van Dijk et al., 2007van Dijk J. Rogowski K. Miro J. Lacroix B. Eddé B. Janke C. A targeted multienzyme mechanism for selective microtubule polyglutamylation.Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 437-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To test the potential impact of these mutations, we introduced them separately into mouse TTLL3, which is identical to human TTLL3 in this region (Figure 4A), and tested the enzymatic activity of the mutated enzymes. Each cancer-related mutation led to a complete loss of glycylase activity of TTLL3 in vivo and in vitro (Figures 4B–4D), suggesting that reduction of monoglycylating activity could be related to cancer. In mammals, TTLL10 appears to be the only enzyme able to elongate glycine side chains. However, in Drosophila, an organism with polyglycylated MTs (Bré et al., 1996Bré M.H. Redeker V. Quibell M. Darmanaden-Delorme J. Bressac C. Cosson J. Huitorel P. Schmitter J.M. Rossier J. Johnson T. et al.Axonemal tubulin polyglycylation probed with two monoclonal antibodies: widespread evolutionary distribution, appearance during spermatozoan maturation and possible function in motility.J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 727-738PubMed Google Scholar), only two orthologs of the TTLL3/8 group are present, whereas no TTLL10 gene has been found (Janke et al., 2005Janke C. Rogowski K. Wloga D. Regnard C. Kajava A.V. Strub J.-M. Temurak N. van Dijk J. Boucher D. Van Dorsselaer A. et al.Tubulin polyglutamylase enzymes are members of the TTL domain protein family.Science. 2005; 308: 1758-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To establish the enzymatic mechanism that leads to the elongation of glycine side chains in the absence of TTLL10, we investigated the activity of the Drosophila melanogaster (dm) enzymes dmTTLL3A (CG11323) and dmTTLL3B (CG11201) in U2OS cells. Both enzymes induced monoglycylation on MTs (Figure 5A, panel TAP952). Some cells expressing dmTTLL3B showed a restricted localization of this enzyme to the nucleus, and accordingly, only the nucleus was labeled with TAP952 in those cells (Figure 5A, #). However, in contrast to the mammalian orthologs (Figure 1C), dmTTLL3A also generated polyglycylated MTs as detected with polyG, while dmTTLL3B polyglycylated nuclear proteins but not MTs (Figure 5A, panel polyG). Immunoblots revealed that dmTTLL3A initiates and elongates glycine side chains on α- and β-tubulin, whereas dmTTLL3B initiates glycylation on a number of proteins including α-tubulin but functions as an elongating glycylase only for non-tubulin substrates (Figure 5B). These polyglycylated substrates of yet unknown identity are likely to be responsible for the observed nuclear staining (Figure 5A). Thus, Drosophila has a polyglycylation mechanism that utilizes bifunctional initiating/elongating glycylases. Polyglycylation is particularly abundant in testes where it is associated with the axonemes of the sperm flagella (Bré et al., 1996Bré M.H. Redeker V. Quibell M. Darmanaden-Delorme J. Bressac C. Cosson J. Huitorel P. Schmitter J.M. Rossier J. Johnson T. et al.Axonemal tubulin polyglycylation probed with two monoclonal antibodies: widespread evolutionary distribution, appearance during spermatozoan maturation and possible function in motility.J.

A massive new posttranslational modification occurs on axonemal tubulin at the final step of spermatogenesis in Drosophila.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 67: 346-355PubMed Google Scholar). In Drosophila, one of the polyglycylase genes, dmTTLL3B, is highly expressed in testes (Figure S6), suggesting that dmTTLL3B is the major polyglycylase in this organ. Thus, we attempted to deplete dmTTLL3B by RNAi, using a transgenic fly carrying inverted repeats that correspond to dmTTLL3B under the control of UAS sequences inducible by Gal4 (UAS-IR-dmTTLL3B transgene). Strikingly, 50% of the embryos carrying UAS-IR-dmTTLL3B and the ubiquitous da-Gal4 driver (dmTTLL3Bda-RNAi) did not survive to adulthood (Figure 6A). RT-PCR analysis of adult dmTTLL3Bda-RNAi flies demonstrated that dmTTLL3B inverted repeats were expressed and dmTTLL3B mRNA levels were strongly decreased. In contrast, mRNA levels of the closest homolog of this gene, dmTTLL3A, were unchanged (Figure 6B), demonstrating the specificity of the dmTTLL3B RNAi. Immunoblots of whole-protein extracts showed a strong reductio"

TARPs control the trafficking and gating of AMPARs. However, the number of TARP molecules that assemble within individual AMPAR channels is unknown. Here, we covalently link AMPARs to TARPs to investigate the properties of TARP/AMPAR complexes with known stoichiometry in HEK cells. We find that AMPARs are functional when associated with four, two, or no TARPs, and that the efficacy of the partial agonist kainate varies across these conditions, providing a sensitive assay for TARP/AMPAR stoichiometry. A comparison of these results with data obtained from hippocampal neurons demonstrates that native AMPARs associate with TARPs with a variable stoichiometry that depends on TARP expression level. Interestingly, AMPARs in hippocampal pyramidal neurons are saturated by TARP expression, while those in dentate gyrus granule neurons are not, indicating that variable TARP/AMPAR stoichiometry provides a mechanism for cell-type-specific regulation of AMPAR function.

Glutamate, the main fast excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS, acts primarily on two types of ionotropic receptors: NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and AMPA receptors (AMPARs). Activation of AMPARs by synaptic glutamate results in fast moment-to-moment depolarization of postsynaptic neurons, a process crucial for information propagation in the CNS. AMPAR subunits form ion channels by assembling as heterotetramers of GluA1–GluA4 (GluR1–GluR4 or GluR-A–GluR-D) (Collingridge et al., 2008Collingridge G.L. Olsen R.W. Peters J. Spedding M.

While most neurons express more than one TARP subtype, cerebellar granule neurons are unique in that they only express γ-2. Accordingly, cultured granule neurons from the mutant mouse stargazer, which lack functional γ-2 protein, have been used as a model system to understand TARP function (Chen et al., 2000Chen L.

Therefore, TARPs are believed to be necessary for AMPAR membrane trafficking and synaptic targeting throughout the brain. An important unanswered question in the field concerns the stoichiometry of the association between TARPs and AMPARs. We previously demonstrated that the decay kinetics of synaptic AMPARs varies with the expression level of TARP γ-2 in cerebellar granule neurons, suggesting a variable TARP/AMPAR stoichiometry (Milstein et al., 2007Milstein A.D. Zhou W. Karimzadegan S. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. TARP subtypes differentially and dose-dependently control synaptic AMPA receptor gating.Neuron. 2007; 55: 905-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, it was not possible to determine the exact stoichiometry from these data; the result could have been produced by mixed populations of AMPARs with anywhere from zero to four associated TARPs. To address whether a variable number of TARPs can assemble with AMPARs, one needs a technique that allows the number of TARPs on individual AMPARs to be counted unambiguously. To this end we have constructed fusion proteins between GluA subunits and TARPs. By coexpressing in HEK cells combinations of GluA1 and GluA2 with and without fused TARPs, we have succeeded in titrating the number of TARPs bound to AMPARs, producing functional AMPAR complexes with zero, two, and four bound TARPs. Importantly, the relative efficacy of the partial agonist kainate, which is known to increase with TARP association (Tomita et al., 2005Tomita S. Adesnik H. Sekiguchi M. Zhang W. Wada K. Howe J.R. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Stargazin modulates AMPA receptor gating and trafficking by distinct domains.Nature. 2005; 435: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, Turetsky et al., 2005Turetsky D. Garringer E. Patneau D.K. Stargazin modulates native AMPA receptor functional properties by two distinct mechanisms.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7438-7448Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), proved to be a particularly sensitive measure of TARP/AMPAR stoichiometry. When compared with these expression data, the efficacy of kainate on endogenous AMPARs from hippocampal neurons is consistent with the binding of multiple TARPs per native AMPAR. Furthermore, relative differences in TARP expression level produce different TARP/AMPAR stoichiometries in two different neuronal cell types, CA1 pyramidal neurons and dentate gyrus granule neurons. Finally, we found that, in addition to kainate efficacy, deactivation and desensitization kinetics of AMPARs vary with TARP expression level in CA1 pyramidal neurons. This variation in stoichiometry broadens the ways in which TARPs modulate AMPAR function in the brain. To fix the number of TARPs associated with individual AMPARs, we fused the full-length GluA1 to the N terminus of TARP γ-2 with a short linker sequence (Figure 1A1). If these receptors assemble and form functional channels expressed on the cell surface, they will contain four TARPs. When expressed in HEK cells, outside-out patches containing the fusion construct A1γ-2 produced sizeable currents in response to application of 1 mM glutamate (Figure 1A2), demonstrating that these channels are properly folded, traffic to the plasma membrane, and appropriately gate in response to glutamate. In order to determine whether the fused TARP molecules are functionally associated with the AMPAR channel, we took advantage of the fact that TARP association increases the efficacy of the partial agonist kainate (Tomita et al., 2005Tomita S. Adesnik H. Sekiguchi M. Zhang W. Wada K. Howe J.R. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Stargazin modulates AMPA receptor gating and trafficking by distinct domains.Nature. 2005; 435: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, Turetsky et al., 2005Turetsky D. Garringer E. Patneau D.K. Stargazin modulates native AMPA receptor functional properties by two distinct mechanisms.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7438-7448Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Indeed, A1γ-2 (Figures 1B and 1H) responded to 1 mM kainate application with substantially larger currents than those produced by GluA1 alone (Figure 1C and 1H), demonstrating that the fused TARP molecules interact with the AMPAR channel and modulate the efficacy of kainate. We assayed kainate efficacy of expressed AMPARs by measuring the ratio of currents induced by kainate relative to glutamate (IKA/IGlu). Fusion of GluA1 to γ-2 (A1γ-2) increased kainate efficacy in a manner similar to coexpression of nonfused GluA1 with γ-2 (Figures 1D and 1H). We also measured the kainate efficacy of channels produced by fusion of GluA1 with the other TARP family members (γ-3, γ-4, and γ-8). Each of these fusion constructs, A1γ-3 (Figure 1E), A1γ-4 (Figure 1F), and A1γ-8 (Figure 1G), produced indistinguishable kainate efficacies (Figure 1H). While some previous studies coexpressing GluAs and TARPs showed differences in kainate efficacy for different TARPs (Cho et al., 2007Cho C.H. St-Gelais F. Zhang W. Tomita S. Howe J.R.

Zhou W. Karimzadegan S. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. TARP subtypes differentially and dose-dependently control synaptic AMPA receptor gating.Neuron. 2007; 55: 905-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found in this set of experiments that the IKA/IGlu observed in HEK cells was sensitive to the ratio of cotransfected GluA and TARP cDNA, with saturating kainate efficacy requiring a GluA:TARP ratio of 1:5 for TARP γ-8 (Figure S1 available online). The observation that fusion of AMPARs and TARPs produces an enhanced kainate efficacy comparable to coexpression of the nonfused proteins raises the possibility that the channels formed in the latter condition normally contain four TARP molecules. However, it is also possible that fewer than four TARPs are sufficient to saturate the effect of TARPs on kainate efficacy. To address this possibility, we devised a method to measure the properties of AMPARs that contain fewer than four TARP molecules. While AMPARs that do not contain the GluA2 subunit are readily blocked by the polyamine toxin philanthotoxin-433 (PhTx), those that do contain GluA2 are not. We reasoned that coexpression of A1γ-2 with nonfused GluA2 would produce two populations of channels—those containing only GluA1 with four TARPs, and those incorporating GluA2 and therefore containing fewer than four TARPs. By including a concentration of PhTx (600 nM) that blocks essentially all A1γ-2 receptors (Figure S2), we could block any four TARP channels and measure the kainate efficacy of the isolated population of GluA2-containing AMPARs with fewer than four associated TARPs. Coexpression of A1γ-2 with GluA2 (Figure 2C), as well as the converse, GluA1+A2γ-2 (Figure 2D), produced kainate efficacies close to halfway between that of GluA1+GluA2, which contains no TARPs (Figure 2A) and A1γ-2+A2γ-2, which contains four TARPs (Figure 2B). This establishes unambiguously that AMPAR channels can be formed that contain fewer than four TARP molecules, and that kainate efficacy covaries with TARP/AMPAR stoichiometry. We obtained similar results with fusion constructs between GluAs and TARP γ-8, with four TARP channels producing maximal kainate efficacy (Figure 2F), and channels associated with fewer than four TARPs producing roughly half the maximal kainate efficacy (Figures 2G and 2H). In summary, functional AMPARs can be produced that contain zero or four TARP molecules and, in addition, receptors can form with an intermediate stoichiometry (Figure 2I). This establishes that kainate efficacy can be used to distinguish between AMPARs with variable TARP/AMPAR stoichiometries. What is the exact stoichiometry of the populations containing fewer than four TARPs? The finding that these heteromers formed by coexpression of GluAs with and without tethered TARPs produce kainate efficacies intermediate between zero-TARP and four-TARP channels suggests that they may contain two TARPs. If there is an absolute requirement that heteromeric AMPARs contain two GluA1s and two GluA2s when they are coexpressed in vitro (Mansour et al., 2001Mansour M. Nagarajan N. Nehring R.B. Clements J.D. Rosenmund C. Heteromeric AMPA receptors assemble with a preferred subunit stoichiometry and spatial arrangement.Neuron. 2001; 32: 841-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), then all of the heteromers would contain precisely two TARPs. If, on the other hand, GluA1 and GluA2 assemble randomly (Washburn et al., 1997Washburn M.S. Numberger M. Zhang S. Dingledine R. Differential dependence on GluR2 expression of three characteristic features of AMPA receptors.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9393-9406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), then coexpression of equal amounts of A1γ-2 and GluA2 would produce channels that predominantly contain two GluA2 subunits, but channels with other stoichiometries would also be present. To distinguish between these possibilities, we varied the ratio of coexpressed A1γ-2 and GluA2 cDNA in order to bias the assembly of AMPARs toward channels that contain either one or three GluA2s, and therefore three or one TARP, respectively. To verify that altering the ratio of cotransfected cDNAs actually results in surface expression of AMPARs with the expected subunit compositions, we measured the percent block by PhTx of glutamate-evoked currents in outside-out patches. When A1γ-2 was expressed in 20-fold excess of GluA2, PhTx blocked ∼90%, while the converse expression ratio produces negligible block by PhTx, as predicted by either model of assembly (Figure S3A). Having confirmed that our cotransfection conditions indeed vary the subunit composition of surface-expressed AMPARs, we next isolated the GluA2-containing, heteromeric AMPAR populations with PhTx and determined their kainate efficacies. When expressing 20-fold more A1γ-2 than GluA2, random assembly would produce heteromeric channels that contain at most one GluA2 subunit, and therefore three TARPs, while assembly that prefers heterodimers would produce channels that contain predominantly two GluA2 subunits, and therefore two TARPs (Figure S3B). Consistent with the latter model, we found that the kainate efficacy for this condition was identical to that obtained with a transfection ratio of 3:2 (Figure 2J). Similar results were obtained in the converse experiment expressing 20-fold more GluA2 than A1γ-2 (Figure 2J). In this case, channels containing four GluA2s and zero TARPs produce negligible currents due to deficits in trafficking and low conductance (Burnashev et al., 1992Burnashev N. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B. Divalent ion permeability of AMPA receptor channels is dominated by the edited form of a single subunit.Neuron. 1992; 8: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, Hollmann and Heinemann, 1994Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Cloned glutamate receptors.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3585) Google Scholar). Indeed, in our conditions homomeric GluA2 receptors generated essentially no current. The slight decrease in kainate efficacy observed for this condition is intermediate between the values predicted by the two assembly models (Figure S3B). This suggests that under these extreme conditions, when GluA2 expression greatly exceeds that of GluA1, it is possible for some channels to form that contain three GluA2 subunits, but assembly is still strongly biased toward formation of channels containing two GluA2 subunits. Comparison of the experimental data to values predicted by various assembly models further rules out the potential complication that kainate efficacy could be saturated for AMPARs containing fewer than four bound TARPs (Figure S3B). These experiments strongly suggest that, even under conditions that should favor channels with assembly ratios of 1:3 or 3:1, GluA1 and GluA2 preferentially assemble at a ratio of 2:2, and that the intermediate kainate efficacy observed when coexpressing GluAs with and without fused TARPs reflects receptors that predominantly contain two TARPs. For experiments coexpressing GluA1+A2γ-2, we expressed GluA1 in excess (3:2) to minimize the chance of forming A2γ-2 homomers, since there is no available pharmacology to block these receptors. Under these conditions, 600 nM PhTx blocked 36% ± 8.3% (n = 7) of the glutamate currents (Figure S2D), indicating the presence of GluA1 homomers in the plasma membrane. In the presence of PhTx, the IKA/IGlu was 0.29 ± 0.03 (n = 9, Figures 2D and 2H), again suggesting that the remaining heteromers contained two TARPs. If coexpression of GluA1 and GluA2 results in preferential formation of heterodimers, we wondered if by just coexpressing fused and nonfused GluA2 we could force the assembly of channels that contain only one TARP. By coexpressing GluA2 in excess of A2γ-2, we predicted that random assembly would prevail, producing either GluA2 homomers containing zero TARPs that do not traffic or conduct, or channels that incorporated one A2γ-2 that could be assayed for kainate efficacy. First we confirmed that expression of A2γ-2 on its own results in a high IKA/IGlu similar to A1γ-2 (0.52 ± 0.04, n = 7), consistent with a four-TARP receptor. Second, we confirmed that expression of GluA2 did not produce currents in our conditions. Surprisingly, when A2γ-2 and GluA2 are expressed with a 1:20 ratio, the resulting IKA/IGlu (0.38 ± 0.02, n = 7) is substantially larger than would be expected for a one-TARP receptor. This suggests that either GluA2 homomers containing one TARP are not assembled, or they are unable to traffic or conduct, similar to GluA2 homomers expressed in the absence of TARPs. We sought to determine if the above results from HEK cells could be compared with data from native AMPARs in neurons in order to read out native TARP/AMPAR stoichiometry. First we measured the kainate efficacy of AMPARs in outside-out patches from mouse CA1 pyramidal neurons. These AMPARs are predominantly (95%) GluA1/2 heteromers (Lu et al., 2009Lu W. Shi Y.

Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), and therefore can be directly compared to the data we obtained expressing these GluAs with TARP γ-8. These native AMPARs displayed a high kainate efficacy consistent with incorporation of four TARP molecules per AMPAR complex (Figure 3A1 and 3C). However, while we examined only the flip splice variant of AMPARs in HEK cells, CA1 pyramidal neurons express both flip and flop variants of AMPARs (Monyer et al., 1991Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. Wisden W. Glutamate-operated channels: developmentally early and mature forms arise by alternative splicing.Neuron. 1991; 6: 799-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). To determine if this might affect the comparison, we repeated the experiments in CA3 pyramidal neurons, which have been shown to express predominantly flip variants (Monyer et al., 1991Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. Wisden W. Glutamate-operated channels: developmentally early and mature forms arise by alternative splicing.Neuron. 1991; 6: 799-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). These experiments yielded a IKA/IGlu identical to that obtained in CA1 pyramidal neurons (0.47 ± 0.04, n = 11), indicating that even if flop receptors exist in CA1 pyramidal neurons, they do not substantially alter kainate efficacy under our conditions. Furthermore, inclusion of the compound PEPA, a drug that blocks the desensitization of flop AMPARs (Sekiguchi et al., 1998Sekiguchi M. Takeo J. Harada T. Morimoto T. Kudo Y. Yamashita S. Kohsaka S.

Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 1294-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), especially when associated with TARPs (Tomita et al., 2006Tomita S. Sekiguchi M. Wada K. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Stargazin controls the pharmacology of AMPA receptor potentiators.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 10064-10067Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), had no effect on glutamate responses in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Figure S4). We further wondered if TARP/AMPAR stoichiometry could be altered by genetic depletion or exogenous overexpression of TARPs. Indeed, outside-out patches from TARP γ-8+/− (Figure 3A2 and 3C) and TARP γ-8−/− (Figures 3A3 and 3C) mice revealed reduced kainate efficacy. However, overexpression of either TARP γ-8 (Figures 3A4 and 3C) or TARP γ-2 (IKA/IGlu = 0.53 ± 0.03; n = 4, data not shown) did not substantially increase kainate efficacy, supporting the notion that native AMPARs in CA1 pyramidal neurons are normally saturated by TARP expression, and therefore contain four TARPs per AMPAR complex. The finding that overexpression of TARP γ-2 does not alter kainate efficacy differs from the results of Turetsky et al., 2005Turetsky D. Garringer E. Patneau D.K. Stargazin modulates native AMPA receptor functional properties by two distinct mechanisms.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7438-7448Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar. However, these authors specifically used immature neurons in which TARP expression levels are low, likely containing AMPARs with reduced stoichiometry. These data are in striking contrast to our previous findings from cerebellar granule neurons, where the apparent TARP/AMPAR stoichiometry was not saturated in wild-type neurons (Milstein et al., 2007Milstein A.D. Zhou W. Karimzadegan S. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. TARP subtypes differentially and dose-dependently control synaptic AMPA receptor gating.Neuron. 2007; 55: 905-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and could be increased by overexpression of TARP γ-2. This raises the possibility that TARP/AMPAR stoichiometry is a parameter that differs across neuronal cell types. We tested this possibility by measuring kainate efficacy in another neuronal population, hippocampal dentate gyrus granule neurons. In situ data suggests that these neurons express lower levels of TARP γ-8 than CA1 or CA3 pyramidal neurons do (Lein et al., 2007Lein E.S. Hawrylycz M.J. Ao N. Ayres M. Bensinger A. Bernard A. Boe A.F. Boguski M.S. Brockway K.S. Byrnes E.J. et al.Genome-wide atlas of gene expression in the adult mouse brain.Nature. 2007; 445: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (3151) Google Scholar), and might be expected to display reduced TARP/AMPAR stoichiometry. Indeed, wild-type granule neurons exhibited a lower kainate efficacy than that observed in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Figures 3B1 and 3C). Furthermore, exogenous overexpression of TARP γ-8 substantially increased kainate efficacy in these neurons (Figures 3B4 and 3C), confirming that AMPARs are not saturated with TARPs in this cell type. Importantly, the kainate efficacy observed when TARP γ-8 was overexpressed was identical to that recorded in CA1 pyramidal neurons, strongly implying that the pharmacological properties of AMPARs in granule cells are the same as in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Similar to pyramidal neurons, genetic depletion of TARP γ-8 further reduced kainate efficacy, with γ-8+/− (Figures 3B2 and 3C) and γ-8−/− (Figures 3B3 and 3C) mice exhibiting reduced kainate efficacy relative to wild-type. In this study we chose to use kainate efficacy as an assay to probe the influence of TARP association on AMPAR function, because of its ease and high sensitivity. However, more physiologically relevant parameters of AMPAR function are the kinetics of channel deactivation and desensitization, which are known to be infl"

However, many intermediates had extensive segments of RNA incorporated throughout the lagging strand (denoted RITOLS). The location of the replication origin also appeared to vary with some initiation events occurring bidirectionally at positions other than OH but with OH acting as a replication terminus. Molecular recombination initiated by double strand breaks is now recognized as a universal and indispensable adjunct to DNA replication. It permits DNA replication to recover from fork collapse (21Michel B. Boubakri H. Baharoglu Z. LeMasson M. Lestini R. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 967-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Stalled replication forks regress to form Holliday junction structures both in mammalian cells (22Fujiwara Y. Tatsumi M. Mutat.

These are then processed to restart replication via the action of junctional resolvases and other components of the recombination machinery (25Michel B. Flores M.J. Viguera E. Grompone G. Seigneur M.

Recombination can also initiate DNA replication in some systems, notably bacteriophages such as T4 (29Mosig G. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 379-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition, molecular recombination is a widespread, if not universal, mechanism of DNA repair notably of double strand breaks and involving exchange of material between homologous segments of damaged and undamaged DNA (30Helleday T. Mutat. Res. 2003; 532: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 31Smith K.C. Bioessays. 2004; 26: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 32Hinz J.M. Tebbs R.S. Wilson P.F.

Failures in this system in nuclear DNA are the cause of a diverse spectrum of human diseases (33Thompson L.H. Schild D. Mutat. Res. 2002; 509: 49-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Plants, fungi, and some other organisms have been shown to have active mtDNA recombination (for a review, see Ref. 34Barr C.M. Neiman M. Taylor D.R. New Phytol. 2005; 168: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and genetic recombination has been reported in cultured mammalian cells harboring different mtDNA deletions or point mutations (35D’Aurelio M.

Intramolecular recombination has also been detected in mammalian cells containing partially duplicated mtDNAs (37Holt I.J. Dunbar D.R. Jacobs H.T. Hum. Mol.

In the plant kingdom, a mitochondrial homologue of the RecA protein has been found in both Arabidopsis (39Khazi F.R. Edmondson A.C. Nielsen B.L. Mol. Genet.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27536-27543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and abundant branched molecules having the characteristics of a Holliday (four-way, X-) junction have been observed in human cardiac muscle mtDNA by two-dimensional AGE (42Kajander O.A. Karhunen P.J. Holt I.J. Jacobs H.T. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Molecular structures resembling four-way junctions have also been inferred in the vicinity of OH in mtDNA from cultured mammalian cells and have been interpreted as pretermination intermediates (15Holt I.J. Lorimer H.E. Jacobs H.T. Cell. 2000; 100: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 43Pohjoismäki J.L. Wanrooij S. Hyvärinen A.K. Goffart S. Holt I.J. Spelbrink J.N. Jacobs H.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5815-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the present work we addressed further the nature and significance of the junctional molecules in human heart mtDNA using a combination of one- and two-dimensional AGE, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and enzymatic treatments. The results indicate that human heart as well as, to a lesser extent, human and mouse brain, maintain mtDNA in multigenomic complexes linked by intercatenation plus four-way and three-way junctions. Standard θ-type replication intermediates were not detectable in human heart mtDNA, indicating that mtDNA replication proceeds via a non-θ mechanism in this tissue. Lastly the pattern of mtDNA replication intermediates detected in the tissue of mice transgenic for either of two proteins involved in mtDNA maintenance, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and Twinkle, shows a substantial increase in junctional forms. Total DNA from cultured cells was extracted by standard methods (43Pohjoismäki J.L. Wanrooij S. Hyvärinen A.K. Goffart S. Holt I.J. Spelbrink J.N. Jacobs H.T.

The samples were taken as part of the Tampere Coronary Study, approved by the Ethics Committee of Tampere University Hospital (DNO 1239/32/200/01) and the National Authority for Medico-legal Affairs, and included cardiac muscle samples from 12 individuals of different ages (for full details see Table 1).

Restriction digestions and other enzyme treatments were performed following the manufacturers’ recommendations (see Ref. 43Pohjoismäki J.L. Wanrooij S. Hyvärinen A.K. Goffart S. Holt I.J.

If subsequent treatment with another nuclease was used, DNA was first recovered by ethanol precipitation and resuspended in the appropriate reaction buffer before treatment with the second enzyme. Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, pH 8.0) and immediately extracted. Two-dimensional AGE and Southern blotting were performed as described previously (Ref. 43Pohjoismäki J.L. Wanrooij S. Hyvärinen A.K. Goffart S. Holt I.J. Spelbrink J.N. Jacobs H.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5815-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar: note the different gel conditions for different fragment sizes). 1–5 μg of total DNA or 100 ng of mtDNA were used in the analysis. Subsequent treatments with topoisomerase IV (John Innes Enterprises), topoisomerase I, T7 endonuclease I, or λ-exonuclease (all New England Biolabs) used the manufacturers’ recommended conditions. When multiple enzyme treatments were used, DNA was ethanol-precipitated between the steps. The gel conditions and blotting were as described in Pohjoismäki et al. (43Pohjoismäki J.L. Wanrooij S.

For Southern hybridization, probes were created by Pfu PCR using as template cloned segments of human mtDNA (see Refs. 19Yasukawa T. Yang M.Y. Jacobs H.T. Holt I.J. Mol.

Mouse mtDNA probes created from mouse mtDNA by Pfu PCR followed by gel purification spanned nucleotides 15357–136 (non-coding region (NCR)) and 5383–5910 (COXI). Pig and rabbit probes were created similarly from total DNA and correspond to the mtDNA fragments ND1 (nucleotides 2821–3422) and COXI (nucleotides 2551–2980), respectively. Probes were labeled using a RediprimeTM II random prime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences; 3000 Ci/mmol). Approximately 1 μg of nucleic acids extracted from sucrose density gradient-purified human heart mitochondria was treated with 50 units of RNase If (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 30 min in the manufacturer’s buffer, recovered by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and redissolved in TEM grade TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm ETDA, pH 7.6). A separate aliquot was digested further with BamHI or PvuII and recovered similarly. Aliquots (0.5–1.0 ng) of mtDNA were prepared and directly mounted on parlodion-coated grids following the Kleinschmidt procedure (46Davis R.W. Davidson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1968; 60: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 47Thresher R. Griffith J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Imaging and image analysis were performed as described previously (48Fouché N. Ozgür S. Roy D. Griffith J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 6044-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We set out initially to characterize the forms of mtDNA and its replication intermediates present in different human tissues. We digested post-mortem DNA samples from human heart and other tissues as well as cultured (HEK 293T) cells with each of two restriction enzymes cutting only once in the mitochondrial genome but in different regions, namely PvuII and BamHI (Fig. 1a). Upon two-dimensional AGE, θ replication intermediates, forming bubble and double Y arcs plus the eyebrow arc associated with RITOLS-type replication (see supplemental Fig. 1), were readily detected in mtDNA of cultured cells, brain, and kidney but were very faint in skeletal muscle. A standard initiation (bubble) arc was seen in the PvuII digest (Fig. 1a, panels ii–v). In the BamHI digest (Fig. 1a, panels vii–x), a double Y arc was prominent as well as either a short bubble arc (in brain) or an “eyebrow” arc resulting from non-digestion at the restriction site (see supplemental Fig. 1 for a fuller explanation). Standard θ replication intermediates were not detectable in human cardiac muscle mtDNA (Fig. 1a, panels i and vi). The major mtDNA replication intermediates (mtRIs) were Y-form molecules encompassing the whole genome; the products of the two digests were virtually indistinguishable electrophoretically. A prominent (X) arc of putative recombination intermediates (i.e. molecules containing four-way junctions) was also seen as well as linear molecules migrating at 2n 31n in the context used here means the unit length of the mitochondrial genome, 16,569 base pairs of DNA. 2n thus means twice that, i.e. a molecule of 33 kbp. and complex forms migrating at >2n in the first dimension that may represent multimeric molecules held together by more than one four-way junction (denoted as dX in Fig. 1a). To investigate whether the absence of the initiation arc in heart could be explained as a trivial artifact arising from loss of bubble structures during extraction, i.e. due to single strand breakage at replication forks, we treated heart and HEK 293T cell PvuII digests with single strand-specific nuclease S1 (supplemental Fig. 2). The HEK 293T cell bubble arc was indeed partially converted to a Y-like (broken bubble) arc, although its trajectory was slightly different from that of the standard Y arc seen in the heart sample, and the largest bubbles were relatively resistant. Importantly S1 nuclease also preferentially degraded the X arc and the 2n linear molecules in the heart sample. These observations indicate that the absence of standard θ intermediates in heart mtDNA is not a degradation artifact. The mtRIs revealed in human brain (Fig. 1a, panels ii and vii) resembled a mixture of those from heart and from other tissues or cultured cells. In previous experiments we found that, in material prepared from crude mitochondria, mtRIs were relatively degraded compared with material extracted from sucrose gradient-purified mitochondria; this was largely attributable to RNase H activity (15Holt I.J. Lorimer H.E. Jacobs H.T. Cell. 2000; 100: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Because of the paucity of material and ethical considerations, the human autopsy samples were generally prepared as total DNA. We therefore conducted one experiment using DNA extracted from sucrose density gradient-purified mitochondria of human cardiac muscle and cerebral cortex isolated as soon as possible after death (6 h). Two-dimensional AGE analysis of this material following PvuII digestion (supplemental Fig. 3a) gave essentially indistinguishable results from those seen with total DNA except that the brain sample was less degraded with both bubble and especially X forms better preserved. Two-dimensional AGE of subgenomic restriction fragments of mtDNA confirmed consistent tissue differences in the patterns of mtRIs seen in heart compared with other tissues or with cultured cells (Fig. 2). We analyzed two overlapping fragments of the genome, namely the HincII fragment spanning the major NCR and containing OH plus the overlapping DraI fragment that excludes the NCR. The mtRIs from sucrose density gradient-purified mitochondria of cultured HEK 293T cells (Fig. 2b, panels vi and xii) included the prominent RNA-containing RITOLS intermediates as detected previously, giving rise to slow moving Y-like arcs (denoted SMY). In total DNA prepared from the same cells (Fig. 2b, panels v and xi) these intermediates were, as previously (16Yang M.Y. Bowmaker M. Reyes A. Vergani L. Angeli P. Gringeri E. Jacobs H.T. Holt I.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), subject to partial degradation during extraction because of RNase H activity, giving rise to modified slow moving Y-like arcs (mSMY). The latter were also seen in total DNA from kidney (Fig. 2b, panels iv and x) and very faintly in total DNA from skeletal muscle (Fig. 2b, panels iii and ix) where all mtRIs were at low abundance. However, they were not detected in total DNA from heart (Fig. 2b, panels i and vii) or brain (Fig. 2b, panels ii and viii). In both heart and brain samples standard Y and prominent X arcs were seen in the DraI digest as well as high molecular weight structures. In the HincII digest, initiation arcs were not seen in the samples from heart or brain even on long exposure (supplemental Fig. 3e), although initiation arcs (modified by ribonucleotide loss) were visible at long exposure in total DNA from cultured cells; supplemental Fig. 3d). However, the Y arc was incomplete, suggesting that OH is still acting, even in heart, as an obligatory terminus of replication. The abundant X arcs seen in human cardiac muscle were not seen in equivalent digests of total DNA from similarly processed cardiac muscle of other mammals (mouse, rabbit, and pig), whereas conventional θ replication intermediates of the RITOLS type were clearly seen in these samples (supplemental Fig. 3b). Note that rabbit and pig hearts were processed at least 24 h after death yet X arcs were absent, indicating that they did not arise in the human samples as a result of a post-mortem artifact under hypoxic conditions In humans, X arcs were seen in cardiac muscle DNA from each of 15 different individuals irrespective of age (e.g. supplemental Fig. 3c). Prominent X arcs were absent from all digests and fragments of human cultured cell, kidney, and skeletal muscle mtDNA. To exclude the possibility that the X arcs seen in human heart might arise as an artifact of preparation due to the regression of stalled replication forks, we treated cultured cells for 72 h with dideoxycytidine to induce systematic chain termination and fork arrest in replicating mtDNA. As expected, this treatment resulted in a large increase in the steady-state level of mtRIs (Fig. 1b). However, θ forms were well preserved, and species migrating on two-dimensional gels as X-junctional molecules such as those seen in myocardial mtDNA preparations did not arise (Fig. 1b). The absence of standard θ replication mtRIs in human cardiac muscle prompted us to look at the overall organization of mtDNA in this tissue. We used TEM to analyze human cardiac muscle mtDNA prepared from sucrose density gradient-purified mitochondria (Fig. 3, a–c). The absence of nuclear DNA contamination was confirmed by Southern blotting to an 18 S rDNA probe (Fig. 3d). In contrast to mtDNA in cultured HEK 293T cells, where the majority of molecules were monomeric circles, most heart mtDNA was organized in multimeric complexes (Table 2 and Fig. 3). Some of these, containing a substantial fraction of the total mtDNA mass, were complex tangles (e.g. Fig. 3a) containing one or several nexuses and frequently more than 20 genome equivalents. At higher magnification (e.g. Fig. 3b) the nexuses did not appear to contain electron-dense fibrous material, such as that seen in preparations of chromatin loops associated with fragments of nuclear matrix. They persisted after digestion with proteinase K and further phenol extraction. However, the tangles were impossible to parse. The simplest multimeric arrays, containing just two to three copies of the genome, appeared to be held together by junctions (Fig. 3c), although their exact nature cannot be inferred from TEM alone. Tailed monomeric (or dimeric) circles were not seen, providing further evidence that the Y arcs seen on two-dimensional gels were not created by breakage of θ bubbles. Conversely three-way junctions that could give rise to the Y arcs seen on two-dimensional gels were visible in the complex tangles mostly at or near nexuses (Fig. 3b). The complex tangles were seen in different spreads of the same mtDNA preparation and in mtDNA preparations from three different individuals although not in HEK 293T cell mtDNA spread in parallel, making it highly unlikely that they were created as an artifact of incomplete spreading. They remained uncut by BglII, which ha"
https://openalex.org/W1988371720,"The interplay between excitation and inhibition in the auditory cortex is crucial for the processing of acoustic stimuli. However, the precise role that inhibition plays in the distributed cortical encoding of natural vocalizations has not been well studied. We recorded single units (SUs) and local field potentials (LFPs) in the awake mouse auditory cortex while presenting pup isolation calls to animals that either do (mothers) or do not (virgins) recognize the sounds as behaviorally relevant. In both groups, we observed substantial call-evoked inhibition. However, in mothers this was earlier, longer, stronger, and more stereotyped compared to virgins. This difference was most apparent for recording sites tuned to tone frequencies lower than the pup calls' high-ultrasonic frequency range. We hypothesize that this auditory cortical inhibitory plasticity improves pup call detection in a relatively specific manner by increasing the contrast between call-evoked responses arising from high-ultrasonic and lateral frequency neural populations."
https://openalex.org/W2086565529,"The pathways leading from aberrant Prion protein (PrP) metabolism to neurodegeneration are poorly understood. Some familial PrP mutants generate increased (Ctm)PrP, a transmembrane isoform associated with disease. In other disease situations, a potentially toxic cytosolic form (termed cyPrP) might be produced. However, the mechanisms by which (Ctm)PrP or cyPrP cause selective neuronal dysfunction are unknown. Here, we show that both (Ctm)PrP and cyPrP can interact with and disrupt the function of Mahogunin (Mgrn), a cytosolic ubiquitin ligase whose loss causes spongiform neurodegeneration. Cultured cells and transgenic mice expressing either (Ctm)PrP-producing mutants or cyPrP partially phenocopy Mgrn depletion, displaying aberrant lysosomal morphology and loss of Mgrn in selected brain regions. These effects were rescued by either Mgrn overexpression, competition for PrP-binding sites, or prevention of cytosolic PrP exposure. Thus, transient or partial exposure of PrP to the cytosol leads to inappropriate Mgrn sequestration that contributes to neuronal dysfunction and disease."

https://openalex.org/W2011098156,"Extracellular signals and cell-intrinsic transcription factors cooperatively instruct generation of diverse neurons. However, little is known about how neural progenitors integrate both cues and orchestrate chromatin changes for neuronal specification. Here, we report that extrinsic signal retinoic acid (RA) and intrinsic transcription factor Neurogenin2 (Ngn2) collaboratively trigger transcriptionally active chromatin in spinal motor neuron genes during development. Retinoic acid receptor (RAR) binds Ngn2 and is thereby recruited to motor neuron genes targeted by Ngn2. RA then facilitates the recruitment of a histone acetyltransferase CBP to the Ngn2/RAR-complex, markedly inducing histone H3/H4-acetylation. Correspondingly, timely inactivation of CBP and its paralog p300 results in profound defects in motor neuron specification and motor axonal projection, accompanied by significantly reduced histone H3-acetylation of the motor neuron enhancer. Our study uncovers the mechanism by which extrinsic RA-signal and intrinsic transcription factor Ngn2 cooperate for cell fate specification through their synergistic activity to trigger transcriptionally active chromatin."

The recent flu epidemic caused by an H1N1 swine influenza virus presents an opportunity to examine what is known about virulence factors and the spread of infection to better prepare for major influenza outbreaks in the future. Influenza virus outbreaks occur with regularity, but the severity of outbreaks is not consistent. The recent flu epidemic caused by an H1N1 swine influenza virus presents an opportunity to examine what is known about virulence factors and the spread of infection to better prepare for major influenza outbreaks in the future. The announcement on April 21, 2009 by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding two patients in California infected with a new swine influenza virus (H1N1) prompted tremendous media coverage and the initiation of pandemic flu preparedness plans by state and federal officials. According to World Health Organization guidelines, the current influenza outbreak is of pandemic proportion as it has caused “widespread human infection.” In response to the outbreak, hundreds of schools in the US and elsewhere have closed, including nearly 2000 schools in Japan. Officials in Mexico, at great economic and public sacrifice, have closed schools and many commercial establishments in an effort to stop the spread of H1N1 infection. Actions such as these reflect the threat that influenza viruses pose as pathogens and the uncertainty around how a particular influenza virus strain will evolve to become more or less virulent. In the 4 weeks following initial case reports in the US, 41 countries reported swine flu infections, with Mexico and the US bearing the majority of disease burden. A total of 11,034 cases and 85 deaths were reported worldwide during that time (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2009_05_21/en/index.html). By comparison, ∼80,000 children die from malaria and more than twice that number die of diarrheal diseases worldwide in any 4 week period (http://www.who.int/topics/infectious_diseases/en/). On a scale of global health crises, the current H1N1 swine influenza outbreak would seem to rank low on the list. Why, then, has this outbreak caused such alarm? Fear around influenza viruses stems from the occurrence of three major pandemics over the last century. Indeed, influenza viruses have the potential to be among the deadliest of all known pathogens. In an average 4 week period during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic caused by an H1N1 strain, 4,000,000 people died from influenza and secondary bacterial infections worldwide (Ahmed et al., 2007Ahmed R. Oldstone M.B. Palese P. Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This is equivalent to twice the number of people who died from AIDS in 2007 worldwide. In a 4 week period, there were ∼150,000 deaths worldwide during the 1957 Asian flu pandemic caused by an H2N2 strain, and ∼80,000 deaths worldwide during the 1968 Hong Kong flu pandemic caused by an H3N2 strain. The history of influenza disease reveals a simple truth: all pandemic strains are not created equal. The swine influenza virus outbreak of 2009 is not the first of its kind. In 1976, swine virus infections were observed at an army training base in Fort Dix, New Jersey. Scientific evidence demonstrated that the virus causing infections was similar to strains that had been circulating in pigs for several years (Palese and Schulman, 1976Palese P. Schulman J.L. Nature. 1976; 263: 528-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting insufficient virulence to affect a human population of average density. Nonetheless, fear of the worst prevailed. Many officials felt that the causative virus was related to the 1918 pandemic virus and that the time was ripe for a new human pandemic. What followed the Fort Dix outbreak was a major panic, resulting in the appropriation of $135 million to support the first mass influenza virus vaccination. The mass vaccination program exposed a rare, but serious, vaccine side effect called Guillain-Barré syndrome, an acute inflammatory demyelinating disorder that can result in paralysis and death. The pandemic never came, but events surrounding the swine flu episode brought to light the complete lack of preparedness for a disease outbreak in the US. In the wake of the debacle, the director of the CDC was replaced and President Ford, despite having made legitimate efforts to consult a variety of experts, was accused by some of acting with excessive force to bolster his re-election campaign. Lessons to be gleaned from the 1976 episode and recommendations for assessing potential pandemic situations are delineated in a chronicle of events by Richard Neustadt and Harvey Fineberg (Neustadt et al., 1978Neustadt R.E. Fineberg H.V. Califano J.A. The Swine Flu Affair: Decision-Making on a Slippery Disease. U.S. Dept. of Health, Education. For sale by the Supt. of Docs., U.S. Govt. Print. Off. Ix, Washington DC1978Google Scholar). They describe that, in 1976, deciding on a course of action in the face of a potential swine flu pandemic was “like placing a bet without knowing the odds.” Unlike that situation in 1976, we now have an understanding of some specific markers that make a particular influenza virus more or less deadly. Faced with a new influenza virus strain, we can evaluate the virus's genome for the presence or absence of these markers in order to inform our expectations and preparations. The presence of a coding sequence for PB1-F2, the smallest protein in the influenza virus repertoire, is one molecular marker of pathogenicity. PB1-F2 is not present in all human influenza viruses; however, it is consistently present in viruses known to be of increased virulence in humans, including the viruses that caused the 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemics. Laboratory studies have confirmed it as a virulence factor in mice, and some mechanisms underlying its role in increased disease pathology have been elucidated (Conenello et al., 2007Conenello G.M. Zamarin D. Perrone L.A. Tumpey T. Palese P. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: 1414-1421https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.0030141Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, Zamarin et al., 2005Zamarin D.

Ortigoza M.B. Palese P. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 7976-7983Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). A second marker of virulence that can be assessed by sequences alone is the degree of identity between the viral hemagglutinin molecules of the new strain and those of other human viruses. Low identity indicates antigenically distinct hemagglutinin structures, suggesting that transmission from human to human will not be blunted by a degree of “herd” immunity resulting from exposure to similar viruses. A third molecular marker known to be relevant in the pathogenicity of avian influenza viruses is the polybasic cleavage site, a protease site in the viral hemagglutinin that enables an expanded array of host proteases to activate the hemagglutinin molecule, enabling virus fusion with a host cell. Some weeks out from the start of an influenza outbreak, the severity of the continuing situation can be assessed based on the following: the number of people who have become ill (measured by hospitalizations and newer monitoring systems such as Google search data, http://www.google.org/flutrends/) and the apparent mortality rate associated with the disease. The drug resistance profile of clinical isolates may also be worthy of consideration; however, in a fast-moving outbreak, it is unlikely that enough people could be treated prophylactically for the rate of transmission to be affected. So how does the 2009 H1N1 swine influenza virus measure up? This virus demonstrates requisite characteristics of a pandemic strain: it can be passed from human to human, it is of sufficient virulence to cause human disease, and to a certain degree, humans are immunologically naive to the virus such that exposure can result in a productive infection. Importantly, H1N1 viruses have circulated consistently in the human population since 1977 and are a component of annual influenza vaccines. Although infection of humans with this particular H1N1 swine influenza virus is a new event, prior exposure to H1N1 viruses would predict a degree of protective immunity in the human population (Table 1). The current circulating H1N1 swine influenza virus does not contain the known molecular marker of pathogenicity PB1-F2, suggesting that it causes a mild disease compared to the three major pandemic viruses of the last century. Clinical isolates demonstrate resistance to the class of flu drugs called adamantanes (M2 inhibitors), but fortunately the virus remains sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors such as Tamiflu and Relenza.Table 1Comparison of Avian and Swine Influenza Viruses2009 Swine H1N11997 Avian H5N1Transmission between humansYesNoCauses human diseaseYes (mild)Yes (severe)Degree of immunity in populationLikelyNoKnown molecular markers of pathogenicityNoPB1-F2; polybasic cleavage site in hemagglutinin Open table in a new tab The H5N1 avian influenza virus, in contrast, currently cannot be transmitted efficiently between humans. It is similarly resistant to adamantane flu drugs, but remains sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors. Unlike the H1N1 swine virus, the H5N1 virus does contain known molecular markers of pathogenicity. Because of these molecular characteristics, the phenotype of disease caused by the H5N1 avian influenza virus is severe, with many cases resulting in acute lung injury and death. Nonetheless, because very few people become infected with this avian virus, the relative severity of threat it poses in its present form is low. If, however, the H5N1 avian influenza virus adapts so that it is transmitted readily from human to human, it could result in a devastating pandemic. We can now make a cautious assessment of the relative severity of the flu outbreak caused by the 2009 H1N1 swine influenza virus. The number of people known to be infected is not growing rapidly, although the geographic breadth of cases reported is large. The mortality rate associated with infection appears to be low. Under these circumstances, the spread and impact of this swine influenza virus are similar to those of viruses during an average flu season. Mutations enabling the expression of PB1-F2, however, could affect this status (circulating strains currently include two stop codons preventing expression of this protein). Alternatively, a reassortment event involving the shuffling of genes with other influenza viruses could lead to incorporation of a gene that would result in PB1-F2 production. Influenza A viruses have segmented, negative-sense RNA genomes that encode up to 11 proteins. These include the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase and the virulence factors NS1 (host interferon antagonist) and PB1-F2 (proapoptotic factor). The viruses are grouped according to the expression of 1 of 16 hemagglutinin subtypes and 1 of 9 neuraminidase subtypes (Palese and Shaw, 2007Palese P. Shaw M.L. Orthomyxoviridae: The viruses and their replication.in: Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields' Virology. Fifth Edition. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2007: 1647-1689Google Scholar). The elusive nature of influenza viruses as targets of adaptive immunity is mostly a function of the hemagglutinin molecule, the major surface antigen eliciting protective antibodies. The hemagglutinin is a remarkable structure, accommodating significant morphological changes while maintaining its crucial functions in attaching the virus to the host cell and mediating fusion of the viral and host membranes. Entry of influenza viruses into cells depends on the presence of a functional hemagglutinin molecule and expression of the host cell receptor for hemagglutinin, sialic acid. Humans and avian species differ in the expression of sialyltransferases in mucosal and respiratory tissues resulting in N-glycans with either α2,6 (human) or α2,3 (avian) linked sialic acids. The ability of a particular virus to bind to either of these two conformations of terminal sialic acid is thought to be the basis for the host restriction that is characteristic of influenza viruses. An avian virus that acquires the ability, via mutation or reassortment, to bind to α2,6-linked sialic acids may cross the species barrier and become infectious in humans. Infections in swine are thought to mediate virus reassortment because swine tissues express both forms of sialic acid, enabling cells to be coinfected with avian and human viruses (Olsen, 2002Olsen C.W. Virus Res. 2002; 85: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Viruses adapted to swine can also combine with human and avian viruses to produce triple reassortants that may have the ability to infect humans. The 2009 H1N1 swine influenza virus is an example of a triple reassortant (Figure 1). Influenza viruses demonstrate variations in their ability to be transmitted between humans. Molecular markers predicting the ability of a virus to be transmitted have not yet been determined. However, low temperature and low humidity are known to be environmental conditions that favor aerosol transmission, explaining the seasonal nature of normal influenza (Lowen et al., 2007Lowen A.C. Mubareka S. Steel J. Palese P. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: 1470-1476https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.0030151Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Only through research can we improve our ability to predict which influenza viruses have the potential to cause serious pandemic disease. Similarly, the informed development of preventative medicines and vaccines depends on progress in basic research. It is critical that regulations governing our work on influenza viruses in the laboratory be rooted in prudence and reason over fear. Arbitrary rules serve only to limit the questions that can be asked at the bench; this translates into unrealized options for preventing disease. The threat posed by atypical influenza viruses in the human population is not new and is difficult to overstate. The success of research programs around the world, however, has contributed to a new degree of understanding such that, when faced with a new circulating virus, we may (cautiously) make judgments about the likely severity of a pandemic and move forward accordingly. In all likelihood, a vaccine providing protective immunity to the 2009 swine H1N1 virus will be developed in the coming months. Additionally, in contrast to 1918, when secondary bacterial pneumonias caused the majority of deaths associated with influenza infection (Ahmed et al., 2007Ahmed R. Oldstone M.B. Palese P. Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we now live in an age of antibiotics and antiviral medications that can prevent the onset of pneumonia. For these reasons, and considering the molecular characteristics of the circulating virus, we feel confident that the 2009 H1N1 swine influenza virus will not cause a pandemic on the scale of those seen during the 20th century.

To understand how CaN contributes to neuronal circuit development, whole-cell mEPSC recordings and multiphoton imaging were performed in the visual system of living Xenopus laevis tadpoles electroporated to express either a CaN phosphatase inhibitor or N-VIVIT, a nuclear localization sequence-tagged VIVIT peptide that blocks the binding of CaN to select substrates including NFAT. Both strategies increased mEPSC frequency and dendritic arbor complexity in tectal neurons over 3 days. Expression of either of two constitutively active Xenopus NFATs (CA-NFATs) restored normal synaptic properties in neurons expressing N-VIVIT. However, the morphological phenotype was only rescued by a CA-NFAT bearing an intact regulatory domain, implying that transcriptional control of morphological and electrophysiological properties of neurons is mediated by distinct NFAT interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2129158239,"Identification of bona fide tumor suppressors is often challenging because of the large number of genetic alterations present in most human cancers. To evaluate candidate genes present within chromosomal regions recurrently deleted in human cancers, we coupled high-resolution genomic analysis with a two-stage genetic study using RNA interference (RNAi). We found that Cyfip1, a subunit of the WAVE complex, which regulates cytoskeletal dynamics, is commonly deleted in human epithelial cancers. Reduced expression of CYFIP1 is commonly observed during invasion of epithelial tumors and is associated with poor prognosis in this setting. Silencing of Cyfip1 disturbed normal epithelial morphogenesis in vitro and cooperated with oncogenic Ras to produce invasive carcinomas in vivo. Mechanistically, we have linked alterations in WAVE-regulated actin dynamics with impaired cell-cell adhesion and cell-ECM interactions. Thus, we propose Cyfip1 as an invasion suppressor gene."

Bovines, particularly water buffaloes, are thought to play a major role in the transmission of schistosomiasis to humans in China. Preliminary results (1998–2003) of a praziquantel (PZQ)-based pilot intervention study we undertook provided proof of principle that water buffaloes are major reservoir hosts for S. japonicum in the Poyang Lake region, Jiangxi Province. Methods and Findings Here we present the results of a cluster-randomised intervention trial (2004–2007) undertaken in Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces, with increased power and more general applicability to the lake and marshlands regions of southern China. The trial involved four matched pairs of villages with one village within each pair randomly selected as a control (human PZQ treatment only), leaving the other as the intervention (human and bovine PZQ treatment). A sentinel cohort of people to be monitored for new infections for the duration of the study was selected from each village. Results showed that combined human and bovine chemotherapy with PZQ had a greater effect on human incidence than human PZQ treatment alone. Conclusions The results from this study, supported by previous experimental evidence, confirms that bovines are the major reservoir host of human schistosomiasis in the lake and marshland regions of southern China, and reinforce the rationale for the development and deployment of a transmission blocking anti-S. japonicum vaccine targeting bovines.

https://openalex.org/W2085487102,"The basal ganglia network is divided into two functionally related subsystems: the neuromodulators and the main axis. It is assumed that neuromodulators adjust cortico-striatal coupling. This adjustment might depend on the response properties and temporal interactions between neuromodulators. We studied functional interactions between simultaneously recorded pairs of neurons in the basal ganglia while monkeys performed a classical conditioning task that included rewarding, neutral, and aversive events. Neurons that belong to a single neuromodulator group exhibited similar average responses, whereas main axis neurons responded in a highly diverse manner. Dopaminergic neuromodulators transiently increased trial-to-trial (noise) correlation following rewarding but not aversive events, whereas cholinergic neurons of the striatum decreased their trial-to-trial correlation. These changes in functional connectivity occurred at different epochs of the trial. Thus, the coding scheme of neuromodulators (but not main axis neurons) can be viewed as a single-dimensional code that is further enriched by dynamic neuronal interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2051019568,"Staged embryonic series are important as reference for different kinds of biological studies. I summarise problems that occur when using 'staging tables' of 'model organisms'. Investigations of developmental processes in a broad scope of taxa are becoming commonplace. Beginning in the 1990s, methods were developed to quantify and analyse developmental events in a phylogenetic framework. The algorithms associated with these methods are still under development, mainly due to difficulties of using non-independent characters. Nevertheless, the principle of comparing clearly defined newly occurring morphological features in development (events) in quantifying analyses was a key innovation for comparative embryonic research. Up to date no standard was set for how to define such events in a comparative approach. As a case study I compared the external development of 23 land vertebrate species with a focus on turtles, mainly based on reference staging tables. I excluded all the characters that are only identical for a particular species or general features that were only analysed in a few species. Based on these comparisons I defined 104 developmental characters that are common either for all vertebrates (61 characters), gnathostomes (26), tetrapods (3), amniotes (7), or only for sauropsids (7). Characters concern the neural tube, somite, ear, eye, limb, maxillary and mandibular process, pharyngeal arch, eyelid or carapace development. I present an illustrated guide listing all the defined events. This guide can be used for describing developmental series of any vertebrate species or for documenting specimen variability of a particular species. The guide incorporates drawings and photographs as well as consideration of species identifying developmental features such as colouration. The simple character-code of the guide is extendable to further characters pertaining to external and internal morphological, physiological, genetic or molecular development, and also for other vertebrate groups not examined here, such as Chondrichthyes or Actinopterygii. An online database to type in developmental events for different stages and species could be a basis for further studies in comparative embryology. By documenting developmental events with the standard code, sequence heterochrony studies (i.e. Parsimov) and studies on variability can use this broad comparative data set."
https://openalex.org/W2055697399,"Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) is a tumor suppressor of cancer and appears to be an important component of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-ss)-induced tumor suppression pathway. Surprisingly, we found that RUNX3 expression level in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tissues, which is one of the most common types of human cancer, was higher than that in normal tissues by a previously published microarray dataset in our preliminary study. Therefore, here we examined the oncogenic role of RUNX3 in HNSCC.Frequent RUNX3 expression and its correlation with malignant behavior were observed in HNSCC. Ectopic RUNX3 overexpression promoted cell growth and inhibited serum starvation-induced apoptosis and chemotherapeutic drug induced apoptosis in HNSCC cells. These findings were confirmed by RUNX3 knockdown. Moreover, RUNX3 overexpression enhanced tumorsphere formation. RUNX3 expression level was well correlated with the methylation status in HNSCC cells. Moreover, RUNX3 expression was low due to the methylation of its promoter in normal oral epithelial cells.Our findings suggest that i) RUNX3 has an oncogenic role in HNSCC, ii) RUNX3 expression observed in HNSCC may be caused in part by demethylation during cancer development, and iii) RUNX3 expression can be a useful marker for predicting malignant behavior and the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs in HNSCC."
https://openalex.org/W1982882392,"The tumor suppressor gene HIC1 (Hypermethylated in Cancer 1) that is epigenetically silenced in many human tumors and is essential for mammalian development encodes a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor. The few genes that have been reported to be directly regulated by HIC1 include ATOH1, FGFBP1, SIRT1, and E2F1. HIC1 is thus involved in the complex regulatory loops modulating p53-dependent and E2F1-dependent cell survival and stress responses. We performed genome-wide expression profiling analyses to identify new HIC1 target genes, using HIC1-deficient U2OS human osteosarcoma cells infected with adenoviruses expressing either HIC1 or GFP as a negative control. These studies identified several putative direct target genes, including CXCR7, a G-protein-coupled receptor recently identified as a scavenger receptor for the chemokine SDF-1/CXCL12. CXCR7 is highly expressed in human breast, lung, and prostate cancers. Using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analyses, we demonstrated that CXCR7 was repressed in U2OS cells overexpressing HIC1. Inversely, inactivation of endogenous HIC1 by RNA interference in normal human WI38 fibroblasts results in up-regulation of CXCR7 and SIRT1. In silico analyses followed by deletion studies and luciferase reporter assays identified a functional and phylogenetically conserved HIC1-responsive element in the human CXCR7 promoter. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and ChIP upon ChIP experiments demonstrated that endogenous HIC1 proteins are bound together with the C-terminal binding protein corepressor to the CXCR7 and SIRT1 promoters in WI38 cells.

A regulatory feedback loop between HIC1 and p53 has been deciphered in which HIC1 directly represses the transcription of SIRT1, which deacetylates and thereby inactivates p53 (10Chen W.Y. Wang D.H.

Therefore, inactivation of one allele of HIC1 results in the de-repression of SIRT1 causing decreased p53-mediated transactivation of the remaining HIC1 allele. In addition, SIRT1 also deacetylates HIC1 and thereby favors its SUMOylation, thus establishing optimal transcriptional repression (12Stankovic-Valentin N. Deltour S. Seeler J. Pinte S. Vergoten G.

Recently, HIC1, SIRT1, and E2F1 have also been implicated in a regulatory feedback loop because HIC1 represses the E2F1 promoter (13Zhang B. Chambers K.J. Leprince D. Faller D.V. Wang S.

Furthermore, E2F1 is a crucial activator of SIRT1 transcription in response to DNA damage, but SIRT1 binds E2F1 and deacetylates it thus inhibiting E2F1-mediated gene activation (14Wang C. Chen L.

Elucidation of the tumorigenic mechanisms initiated by HIC1 inactivation is dependent upon the identification of the genes targeted by HIC1-mediated transcriptional repression. To identify these target genes, we created an adenoviral vector encoding a FLAG-HIC1 fusion protein and infected U2OS osteosarcoma cells, a cell line known to have lost HIC1 expression. Gene expression profiling was used to identify putative target genes, and confirmatory studies were then performed. Collectively, these studies identified CXCR7 as a direct transcriptional target of HIC1. A HindIII-XbaI fragment containing the coding sequence of human HIC1 fused to an in-frame N-terminal FLAG epitope was prepared from the pcDNA3-FLAG-HIC1 vector (6Deltour S. Pinte S. Guerardel C.

Recombinant adenovirus vectors (Ad-FLAG-HIC1) were obtained as described previously (18Bernard D. Gosselin K. Monte D. Vercamer C. Bouali F. Pourtier A. Vandenbunder B. Abbadie C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 472-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The recombinant adenovirus encoding green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) has been described previously (8Guerardel C.

U2OS cells were infected by adding virus stocks directly to the culture medium at an input multiplicity of 100 viral particles/cell (18Bernard D. Gosselin K. Monte D. Vercamer C. Bouali F. Pourtier A. Vandenbunder B. Abbadie C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 472-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). At nine time points after adenoviral infection (from 8 to 26 h), total RNA was isolated from each sample using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 6.0 μg of total RNA from each sample was then converted to double-stranded cDNA using the SuperScript Choice System (Invitrogen). cDNA was purified using a phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction. Clean cDNA was used for the in vitro synthesis of biotin-labeled cRNA using the BioArray RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY). cRNA was cleaned using RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and fragmented randomly to ∼200 bp. Labeled cRNAs were hybridized to human HG-U133A chips (Affymetrix) for 16 h. Each chip was scanned using a confocal laser scanner after staining with streptavidin phycoerythrin followed by a signal-amplifying second antibody. Data analysis was performed using the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 software to generate an absolute analysis for each chip. Each chip was scaled to a target intensity value of 150 to allow for inter-array comparisons. Per gene normalizations were performed by normalizing the genes in each HIC1 chip to their corresponding gene on the control GFP chip for each of the time points. Genes that were flagged as absent across all time points for both cell types were removed from the analysis. Self-organizing maps were used to identify major trends in expression. Raw data can be obtained at NCBI GEO (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), accession number GSE9854, or the Children's National Medical Center Public Expression Profiling Resource site. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes that were treated as described previously (6Deltour S. Pinte S. Guerardel C. Wasylyk B. Leprince D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4890-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Antibodies against HIC1 (325 and 2563) have been described previously (6Deltour S. Pinte S. Guerardel C. Wasylyk B. Leprince D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4890-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG M2 (F3165, Sigma) is a monoclonal antibody directed against the epitope tag. We have also used monoclonal antibodies against Hsp60 (sc-13115, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and polyclonal antibodies against CtBP1 (C8741, Sigma). The secondary antibodies were anti-rabbit and anti-mouse immunoglobulins and a horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody from Amersham Biosciences. pLKO1 lentiviral vectors expressing short hairpin (sh) RNAs targeting HIC1 were purchased from Sigma. Two shRNAs (clone ID; NM_006487.1-1763s1c1 and 1-1982s1c1) that have been shown to efficiently knock down HIC1 mRNA (19Britschgi C. Jenal M. Rizzi M. Mueller B.U. Torbett B.E. Andres A.C. Tobler A. Fey M.F. Tschan M.P. Br. J. Haematol. 2008; 141: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as well as a control shRNA (nontargeting shRNA vector, SHC002, Sigma) were used in these experiments. These vectors contain a puromycin resistance gene for selection of the transduced cells. Lentivirus production, transduction of cells, and selection of the transduced cells for 1 week using 2.0 μg/ml puromycin was performed as described (19Britschgi C. Jenal M. Rizzi M. Mueller B.U.

The CXCR7 promoter region was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy donors using forward and reverse primers containing KpnI and XhoI restriction sites (supplemental Table S1). After restriction digestion, the fragment was cloned in the pGL3 basic reporter gene vector to generate the CXCR7 promoter construct, pGL3 CXCR7 −813/+168. The −386/+164, −191/+164, and −26/+164 CXCR7 promoter constructs were prepared from this construct by PCR (supplemental Table S1). The −191/+164 and −26/+164 ΔXI mutants were generated by the two-round PCR strategy with the following mutant oligonucleotides: sense CAAAGCCATCATCTAGAGGGC and antisense CCTCTAGATGATGGCTTTGTAACCC, in which TGC in the HiRE site is replaced by CAT, a mutation shown to abolish HIC1 binding (5Pinte S.

The −863/+168 ΔXI construct has been obtained through restriction fragment swapping using a unique SpeI site (position −75 to −70). Briefly, the KpnI-SpeI fragment from the −863/+168 construct was exchanged with the small KpnI-SpeI fragment from the −26/+164 ΔXI mutant. All constructs were verified by nucleotide sequencing. U2OS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transfected in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) by the polyethyleneimine (Euromedex) method in 12-well plates with 500 ng of DNA (20Pinte S. Guérardel C. Deltour-Balerdi S. Godwin A.K. Leprince D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4023-4031Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected for 6 h and then were incubated in fresh complete medium. They were rinsed in cold phosphate-buffered saline 48 h after transfection and lysed with the luciferase assay buffer. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured by using, respectively, beetle luciferin (Promega) and the Galacto-light kit (Tropix) with a Berthold chemiluminometer. After normalization to β-galactosidase activity, the data were expressed as fold activation relative to the empty pGL3 basic control vector. Results represented are the mean values and standard deviations from at least two independent transfections in triplicate. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using random primers and MultiScribeTM reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems). Real time PCR analysis was performed by FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I PCR (Roche Applied Science) in a LightCycler fluorescence temperature cycler (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers for SIRT1 and CXCR7 as well as control primers for actin and GAPDH are summarized in supplemental Table S2. Primers were used at a concentration of 0.5 μm. According to a melting point analysis, only one PCR product was amplified under these conditions. RNAs extracted from U2OS Ad-GFP were used to generate a standard curve for each gene. Results were normalized with respect to the internal controls and are expressed relative to the levels found in Ad-GFP-infected U2OS cells. Similar experiments were performed with cells transduced by the control shRNA or the shRNA targeting HIC1. ChIP was performed according to published protocols with slight modifications. Briefly, formaldehyde was added directly to the cultured cells to a final concentration of 1% for 10 min at 37 °C. The cross-linking was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. After 5 min at 37 °C, cells were lysed directly in the plates by resuspension in cell lysis buffer for 5 min. Then the samples were pelleted, resuspended in nuclei lysis buffer, and sonicated to chromatins with an average size of 500 bp using a BioRuptor (Diagenode, Liege, Belgium). After preclearing with a 50% slurry of protein A-G beads preincubated with salmon sperm DNA and bovine serum albumin for 4 h at 4 °C, the chromatins were incubated with the anti-HIC1 antibodies, normal rabbit IgG, or with no antibodies overnight. The antibody-bound chromatin was then pooled down for 30 min with protein A-G beads, washed extensively, and eluted two times with 250 μl of elution buffer. After addition of 20 μl of 5 m NaCl, the cross-linking was reversed by overnight incubation at 65 °C. The immunoprecipitated DNAs as well as whole cell extract DNAs (input) were purified by treatment with RNase A and then proteinase K followed by purification on Nucleobond Extract II (Macherey-Nagel). The purified DNAs were used for PCR analyses using the relevant primers for SIRT1, CXCR7, and GAPDH (see supplemental Table S3). For ChIP upon ChIP experiments, we started with 8-fold more cells than in the single ChIP experiment. After the first round of immunoprecipitation, the beads were pooled by centrifugation in TE buffer and incubated in 100 μl of elution buffer for 10 min at 65 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted in 900 μl of IP buffer and incubated with the second antibody as in a single ChIP experiment. U2OS cells were infected with Ad-FLAG-HIC1 or Ad-GFP at a multiplicity of infection of 100 that was determined experimentally to allow infection of 90–100% of the cells as shown by immunofluorescence analyses at 24 h after infection. HIC1 proteins display a nuclear punctated localization typical of BTB/POZ proteins (Fig. 1 A). Examination of the kinetics of infection over 48 h demonstrated that Ad-FLAG-HIC1 proteins can be detected by Western blotting as early as 16 h post-infection (Fig. 1B). Ectopic overexpression of HIC1 resulted in a proliferation arrest starting around 16 h, coinciding with the detectability of the FLAG-HIC1 protein (Fig. 1C). U2OS cells infected with the control Ad-GFP virus did not undergo proliferation arrest. To obtain a profile of HIC1-regulated genes, we prepared total RNAs from U2OS cells infected at a multiplicity of infection of 100 with Ad-FLAG-HIC1 or Ad-GFP as control and extracted every 2 h starting at 8 until 26 h post-infection. Multiple infection time points provided independent sets of experiments that allowed the identification of early regulated genes that are more likely to be direct target genes. These RNAs were then used to interrogate the Affymetrix Human Genome U133A chip containing 14,500 transcripts. Direct comparisons were performed between Ad-FLAG-HIC1 and Ad-GFP-infected cells for each time of infection. These analyses revealed that 81 genes were down-regulated more than 3-fold, whereas 23 were up-regulated more than 3-fold after 16 and 24 h of infection, respectively (TABLE 1, TABLE 2). Upon closer analysis of the differentially expressed genes, it became apparent that the repressed genes were observed early post-infection, whereas the activated genes were predominantly found later in the infection kinetics, suggesting that they are not direct HIC1 target genes in keeping with the known function of HIC1 as a transcriptional repressor. Strikingly, SIRT1, a direct HIC1 target gene in WI38 cells (10Chen W.Y. Wang D.H. Yen R.C. Luo J. Gu W. Baylin S.B. Cell. 2005; 123: 437-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), was not repressed in the Ad-FLAG-HIC1-infected U2OS cells; rather it was slightly activated (Fig. 2A). These microarray data were confirmed by qRT-PCR using RNAs from the 16-h time point (Fig. 2B).TABLE 1Genes repressed more than 3-fold in Ad-FLAG-HIC1-infected U2OS cells at 16 h of infectionRepressed gene nameRelative expression at 16 hAffymetrix probe set no.Chromosomal location%SNAP 43, SNAPC19205443_at14q22TRIM16, TRIM16L17204341_at17p11.2MAP2K318215498_s_at17q11.2PLEC118201373_at8q24RDC1, CXCR720212977_at2TNS320217853_at7p12.3LIF20205266_at22q12.2WDR621217734_s_at15q21AMIGO221222108_at7MAP2K521211371_at15q22.2-q22.31GRSF122215030_at4q13.3FADS123208963_x_at11q12.2-q13.1CYP24A123206504_at20q13ADORA2B23205891_at17p12-p11.2KIAA102625213478_at1p36.13RIN226209684_at20p11.22LRP826205282_at1p34MCAM27209086_x_at11q23.3ADRB227206170_at5q31-q32TMEM16B28220111_s_at12CCND129208712_at11q13AHNAK229212992_at14KCNJ630214126_at21q22.13-q22.2LRP830208433_s_at1p34CA1230203963_at15q22DRAL, SLIM3, FHL231202949_s_at2q12-q14INHBA31210511_s_at7p15-p13NOV31214321_at8q24.1SFXN332220974_x_at10q24.2SNAP-2532202508_s_at20p12-p11.2EPHA232203499_at1p36SOX933202935_s_at17q24.3-q25.1CXCL1433218002_s_at5q31 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Genes activated more than 3-fold in Ad-FLAG-HIC1-infected U2OS cells at 24 h of infectionUp-regulated gene nameRelative expression at 24 hAffymetrix probe set no.Chromosomal location%CA2974209301_at8q22MMP12744204580_at11q22.3ID4644209291_at6p22-p21SMPDL3A464213624_at6q22.31LPPR4460213496_at1p21.2CCNE2448205034_at8q22.1C14orf45447220173_at14q24.3ACTA2442200974_at10q23.3TNFAIP8413210260_s_at5q23.1CDO1407204154_at5q22-q23SLC7A11393207528_s_at4q28-q32CYP7B1386207386_at8q21.3TMEM62384218776_s_at15q15.2KIAA0895371213424_at7p14.2PLA2G4A356210145_at1q25FST355204948_s_at5q11.2ABHD3333213017_at18q11.2SPP1333209875_s_at4q21-q25GPR161328214104_at1q24.2LGALS8325210732_s_at1q42-q43TMEM47316209656_s_atXp11.4SRGN310201859_at10q22.1ITPR1307203710_at3p26-p25 Open table in a new tab Thus, SIRT1 is not a HIC1 target gene in the Ad-FLAG-HIC1-infected U2OS cells as has also been shown in an Ad-HIC1-infected human D245 medulloblastoma cell line (21Briggs K.J.

Nevertheless, our results are in close agreement with the well established function of HIC1 as a transcriptional repressor (5Pinte S. Stankovic-Valentin N. Deltour S. Rood B.R. Guérardel C.

Among the genes most markedly repressed in HIC1-overexpressing U2OS cells, we decided to focus our efforts on the orphan G protein-coupled receptor RDC1 because of its relevance to cancer and the presence of HIC1 consensus binding sites in the regulatory region of the gene. RDC1 has been recently “deorphanized” as the scavenger chemokine receptor CXCR7 that binds chemokine CXCL11 and CXCL12, also known as SDF-1 (stromal-derived factor) (22Balabanian K. Lagane B. Infantino S. Chow K.Y. Harriague J. Moepps B. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thelen M. Bachelerie F. J. Biol.

Rehemtulla A. Kleer C.G. Essner J.J. Nasevicius A. Luker G.D. Howard M.C. Schall T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 15735-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). After infection by Ad-FLAG-HIC1, CXCR7 was specifically down-regulated 5–7-fold (Fig. 2A), as confirmed by Northern blot analyses (data not shown) and by qRT-PCR (Fig. 2B, left panel). Collectively, these data suggested that CXCR7 is a target gene of HIC1 in U2OS cells infected by Ad-FLAG-HIC1. All the previous results were obtained by ectopic HIC1 expression through infection with adenovirus of transformed cell lines not expressing endogenous HIC1. To validate CXCR7 as a HIC1 transcriptional target in a more physiological situation, we used RNA interference with a lentiviral shRNA against HIC1 to reduce endogenous HIC1 expression in normal human WI38 fibroblasts. These cells were chosen because they express HIC1 (supplemental Fig. S1) and have previously been used to validate SIRT1 as a direct HIC1 target gene (10Chen W.Y. Wang D.H. Yen R.C. Luo J. Gu W. Baylin S.B. Cell. 2005; 123: 437-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). To that end, we generated WI38 cell lines expressing a nontargeting control shRNA (SHC002) and two cell lines expressing shRNAs targeting HIC1 (shHIC1 1763 and shHIC1 1982), as shown previously in HL60 acute myeloid leukemia cells (19Britschgi C. Jenal M. Rizzi M. Mueller B.U. Torbett B.E. Andres A.C. Tobler A. Fey M.F. Tschan M.P. Br. J. Haematol. 2008; 141: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). qRT-PCR analyses demonstrated an efficient, roughly 50%, knockdown of HIC1 in the WI38 shHIC1 1763 and 1982 cell lines as compared with the cells infected with the control shRNA (Fig. 3A). Similar analyses using the same RNA samples detected a 2-fold increase in CXCR7 expression (Fig. 3B) and a 1.5-fold up-regulation of SIRT1 (Fig. 3C). These results demonstrate that knockdown of endogenous HIC1 in normal human WI38 fibroblasts results in up-regulation of CXCR7 as well as of SIRT1, as shown previously (10Chen W.Y. Wang D.H. Yen R.C. Luo J. Gu W. Baylin S.B. Cell. 2005; 123: 437-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). All the above described results demonstrate that CXCR7 is a HIC1 target gene. To determine whether CXCR7 is a direct target gene of HIC1, we first scanned its promoter region for the presence of consensus HIC1-responsive elements (HiRE, 5′-(C/G)NG(C/G)GGGCA(C/A)CC-3′) centered on a GGCA (reverse TGCC) core motif (5Pinte S.

These analyses identified 11 putative HiRE to which HIC1 could directly bind through its Krüppel-like C2H2 zinc fingers, some of which are conserved in primate (human and chimpanzee) and rodent (rat and mouse) genomes (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S2). To directly assess the ability of HIC1 to repress transcription of CXCR7 through these sites, we cloned ∼0.8 kbp of genomic DNA upstream of the transcription start site and first noncoding exon of CXCR7, as defined in GenBankTM (NM_020311; gi114155149), and performed luciferase promoter-reporter assays. To this end, the −813/+168 promoter region of CXCR7 was cloned in the pGL3 basic reporter vector, and a series of deletion constructs were made that gradually eliminated the putative HiREs (Fig. 4, A and B). These constructs were then transfected alone or with the pcDNA3 FLAG-HIC1 expression vector into U2OS cells, and promoter activities were thus measured in the absence or presence of HIC1. As shown in Fig. 4B, transient transfection of HIC1 significantly repressed the strong CXCR7 prom"
https://openalex.org/W1980082736,"Lipid rafts are plasma membrane microdomains that are enriched in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins and play an important role in the signaling of ITAM-bearing lymphocyte antigen receptors. Dectin-1 is a C-type lectin receptor (CLR) that recognizes beta-glucan in the cell walls of fungi and triggers signal transduction via its cytoplasmic hemi-ITAM. However, it is not known if similar to antigen receptors, Dectin-1 would also signal via lipid rafts and if the integrity of lipid raft microdomains is important for the physiological functions mediated by Dectin-1. We demonstrate here using sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and confocal microscopy that Dectin-1 translocates to lipid rafts upon stimulation of dendritic cells (DCs) with the yeast derivative zymosan or beta-glucan. In addition, two key signaling molecules, Syk and PLCgamma2 are also recruited to lipid rafts upon the activation of Dectin-1, suggesting that lipid raft microdomains facilitate Dectin-1 signaling. Disruption of lipid raft integrity with the synthetic drug, methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (betamD) leads to reduced intracellular Ca2+ flux and defective Syk and ERK phosphorylation in Dectin-1-activated DCs. Furthermore, betamD-treated DCs have significantly attenuated production of IL-2, IL-10, and TNFalpha upon Dectin-1 engagement, and they also exhibit impaired phagocytosis of zymosan particles. Taken together, the data indicate that Dectin-1 and perhaps also other CLRs are recruited to lipid rafts upon activation and that the integrity of lipid rafts is important for the signaling and cellular functions initiated by this class of innate receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2042439225,"Although replication proteins are conserved among eukaryotes, the sequence requirements for replication initiation differ between species. In all species, however, replication origins fire asynchronously throughout S phase. The temporal program of origin firing is reproducible in cell populations but largely probabilistic at the single-cell level. The mechanisms and the significance of this program are unclear. Replication timing has been correlated with gene activity in metazoans but not in yeast. One potential role for a temporal regulation of origin firing is to minimize fluctuations in replication end time and avoid persistence of unreplicated DNA in mitosis. Here, we have extracted the population-averaged temporal profiles of replication initiation rates for S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, D. melanogaster, X. laevis and H. sapiens from genome-wide replication timing and DNA combing data. All the profiles have a strikingly similar shape, increasing during the first half of S phase then decreasing before its end. A previously proposed minimal model of stochastic initiation modulated by accumulation of a recyclable, limiting replication-fork factor and fork-promoted initiation of new origins, quantitatively described the observed profiles without requiring new implementations.The selective pressure for timely completion of genome replication and optimal usage of replication proteins that must be imported into the cell nucleus can explain the generic shape of the profiles. We have identified a universal behavior of eukaryotic replication initiation that transcends the mechanisms of origin specification. The population-averaged efficiency of replication origin usage changes during S phase in a strikingly similar manner in a highly diverse set of eukaryotes. The quantitative model previously proposed for origin activation in X. laevis can be generalized to explain this evolutionary conservation."
https://openalex.org/W1999633266,"Cortical motor areas are thought to contribute ""higher-order processing,"" but what that processing might include is unknown. Previous studies of the smooth pursuit-related discharge of supplementary eye field (SEF) neurons have not distinguished activity associated with the preparation for pursuit from discharge related to processing or memory of the target motion signals. Using a memory-based task designed to separate these components, we show that the SEF contains signals coding retinal image-slip-velocity, memory, and assessment of visual motion direction, the decision of whether to pursue, and the preparation for pursuit eye movements. Bilateral muscimol injection into SEF resulted in directional errors in smooth pursuit, errors of whether to pursue, and impairment of initial correct eye movements. These results suggest an important role for the SEF in memory and assessment of visual motion direction and the programming of appropriate pursuit eye movements."
https://openalex.org/W2097738501,"Burkholderia cenocepacia is an opportunistic pathogen that displays a remarkably high resistance to antimicrobial peptides. We hypothesize that high resistance to antimicrobial peptides in these bacteria is because of the barrier properties of the outer membrane. Here we report the identification of genes for the biosynthesis of the core oligosaccharide (OS) moiety of the B. cenocepacia lipopolysaccharide. We constructed a panel of isogenic mutants with truncated core OS that facilitated functional gene assignments and the elucidation of the core OS structure in the prototypic strain K56-2. The core OS structure consists of three heptoses in the inner core region, 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid, d-glycero-d-talo-octulosonic acid, and 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose linked to d-glycero-d-talo-octulosonic acid. Also, glucose is linked to heptose I, whereas heptose II carries a second glucose and a terminal heptose, which is the site of attachment of the O antigen. We established that the level of core truncation in the mutants was proportional to their increased in vitro sensitivity to polymyxin B (PmB). Binding assays using fluorescent 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-labeled PmB demonstrated a correlation between sensitivity and increased binding of PmB to intact cells. Also, the mutant producing a heptoseless core OS did not survive in macrophages as compared with the parental K56-2 strain. Together, our results demonstrate that a complete core OS is required for full PmB resistance in B. cenocepacia and that resistance is due, at least in part, to the ability of B. cenocepacia to prevent binding of the peptide to the bacterial cell envelope. Burkholderia cenocepacia is an opportunistic pathogen that displays a remarkably high resistance to antimicrobial peptides.

We established that the level of core truncation in the mutants was proportional to their increased in vitro sensitivity to polymyxin B (PmB). Binding assays using fluorescent 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-labeled PmB demonstrated a correlation between sensitivity and increased binding of PmB to intact cells. Also, the mutant producing a heptoseless core OS did not survive in macrophages as compared with the parental K56-2 strain. Together, our results demonstrate that a complete core OS is required for full PmB resistance in B. cenocepacia and that resistance is due, at least in part, to the ability of B. cenocepacia to prevent binding of the peptide to the bacterial cell envelope. Burkholderia cenocepacia is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen ubiquitously found in the environment (1Mahenthiralingam E. Urban T.A. Goldberg J.B. Nat. Rev.

Urban T.A. Goldberg J.B. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 144-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) such as those with cystic fibrosis and chronic granulomatous disease. Infected cystic fibrosis patients commonly develop chronic lung infections that are very difficult to treat because these bacteria are intrinsically resistant to virtually all clinically useful antibiotics as well as antimicrobial peptides (APs) 5The abbreviations used are: APantimicrobial peptideDQF-COSYdouble quantum filtered correlation spectroscopyd-QuiNd-quinovosamineHMBCheteronuclear multiple bond correlationHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherenceKdo3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acidKod-glycero-d-talo-octulosonic acidl-Ara4N4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinoseLPSlipopolysaccharidel-Rhal-rhamnoseMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationMSmass spectrometryNOEnuclear Overhauser effectOSoligosaccharidePmBpolymyxin BTOCSYtotal correlation spectroscopyTOFtime-of-flightT-ROESYtransverse rotating-frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopyDMEMDulbecco’s modified Eagle’s mediumFBSfetal bovine serumdansyl5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonylTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineBcCVB. cenocepacia-containing vacuole. 5The abbreviations used are: APantimicrobial peptideDQF-COSYdouble quantum filtered correlation spectroscopyd-QuiNd-quinovosamineHMBCheteronuclear multiple bond correlationHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherenceKdo3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acidKod-glycero-d-talo-octulosonic acidl-Ara4N4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinoseLPSlipopolysaccharidel-Rhal-rhamnoseMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationMSmass spectrometryNOEnuclear Overhauser effectOSoligosaccharidePmBpolymyxin BTOCSYtotal correlation spectroscopyTOFtime-of-flightT-ROESYtransverse rotating-frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopyDMEMDulbecco’s modified Eagle’s mediumFBSfetal bovine serumdansyl5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonylTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineBcCVB. cenocepacia-containing vacuole.

Respir. Crit.

Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3285) Google Scholar, 5Caroff M. Karibian D. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 2431-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The O antigen acts as a protective barrier against desiccation, phagocytosis, and serum complement-mediated killing, whereas the core OS and the lipid A contribute to maintain the integrity of the outer membrane (4Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3285) Google Scholar, 5Caroff M. Karibian D. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 2431-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The lipid A also anchors the LPS molecule to the outer leaflet of the outer membrane and accounts for the endotoxic activity of LPS (4Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3285) Google Scholar, 6Raetz C.R. Reynolds C.M. Trent M.S. Bishop R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 295-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Lipid A is a bisphosphorylated Β-1,6-linked glucosamine disaccharide substituted with fatty acids ester-linked at positions 3 and 3′ and amide-linked at positions 2 and 2′ (4Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3285) Google Scholar). The core OS can be subdivided into the inner core and outer core. The inner core OS typically consists of one or two 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residues linked to the lipid A and three l-glycero-d-manno-heptose residues linked to the first Kdo (4Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3285) Google Scholar). The outer core OS in enteric bacteria typically consists of 8–12 branched sugars linked to heptose II of the inner core. As a result of phosphate groups on the lipid A and core OS, the bacterial surface has a net negative charge. This plays an important role in the interaction of the bacterial surface with positively charged compounds such as cationic APs, which are cationic amphipathic molecules that kill bacteria by membrane permeabilization. In response to a series of environmental conditions such as low magnesium or high iron, bacteria can express modified LPS molecules that result in a less negative surface. This reduces the binding of APs and promotes resistance to these compounds. Previous studies have shown that Burkholderia LPS molecules possess unique properties. For example, Kdo cannot be detected by classic colorimetric methods in LPS from Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia cepacia, and the covalent linkage between Kdo and lipid A is more resistant to acid hydrolysis than in conventional LPS molecules (7Isshiki Y. Kawahara K. Zähringer U. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 313: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In B. cepacia, 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (l-Ara4N) is bound to the lipid A by a phosphodiester linkage at position 4 of the nonreducing glucosamine (GlcN II) (8Silipo A. Molinaro A. Cescutti P. Bedini E. Rizzo R. Parrilli M. Lanzetta R. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 561-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and is also present as a component of the core OS. Also, instead of two Kdo molecules, the B. cepacia core OS has only one Kdo and the unusual Kdo analog, d-glycero-d-talo-octulosonic acid (Ko), which is nonstoichiometrically substituted with l-Ara4N forming a 1→8 linkage with α-Ko (7Isshiki Y. Kawahara K. Zähringer U. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 313: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Isshiki Y. Zähringer U. Kawahara K. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 2659-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although this is also the case for the inner core OS of B. cenocepacia J2315 (10Silipo A. Molinaro A. Ieranó T. De Soyza A. Sturiale L. Garozzo D. Aldridge C. Corris P.A. Khan C.M. Lanzetta R. Parrilli M. Chemistry. 2007; 13: 3501-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), it is not a common feature for the core OS in all Burkholderia. For example, the inner core of Burkholderia caryophylli consists of two Kdo residues and does not possess l-Ara4N (11Molinaro A. De Castro C. Lanzetta R. Evidente A. Parrilli M. Holst O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10058-10063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Burkholderia species, including B. cenocepacia, are intrinsically resistant to human and non-human APs such as these produced by airway epithelial cells (12Baird R.M. Brown H. Smith A.W. Watson M.L. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 44: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Devine D.A. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 40: 431-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), human Β-defensin 3 (14Sahly H. Schubert S. Harder J. Rautenberg P. Ullmann U. Schröder J. Podschun R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 1739-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), human neutrophil peptides (15Loutet S.A. Flannagan R.S. Kooi C. Sokol P.A. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2073-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and polymyxin B (PmB) (15Loutet S.A. Flannagan R.S. Kooi C. Sokol P.A. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2073-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16Burtnick M.N. Woods D.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 2648-2656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The minimum inhibitory concentration determined for some of these peptides in several Burkholderia species is greater than 500 μg/ml, which could aid these microorganisms during colonization of the respiratory epithelia (13Devine D.A. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 40: 431-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the resistance of B. cepacia to cationic APs stems from ineffective binding to the outer membrane, as a consequence of the low number of phosphate and carboxylate groups in the lipopolysaccharide (17Cox A.D. Wilkinson S.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), but a systematic analysis of the molecular basis of AP resistance in B. cenocepacia and other Burkholderia is lacking. We have previously reported that a heptoseless B. cenocepacia mutant (SAL1) is significantly more sensitive than the parental clinical strain K56-2 to APs (15Loutet S.A. Flannagan R.S. Kooi C. Sokol P.A. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2073-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This mutant has a truncated inner core and lacks the outer core, suggesting that a complete core OS is required for resistance of B. cenocepacia to APs.Apart from heptoses, the role of other sugar moieties of the B. cenocepacia core OS in AP resistance is not known. In this study, we report the structure of the core OS for B. cenocepacia strain K56-2 and its isogenic mutants XOA3, XOA7, and XOA8, which carry various core OS truncations. The structural analysis, combined with mutagenesis, allowed us to assign function to the majority of the genes involved in core OS biosynthesis and ligation of the O antigen and to establish that the degree of truncation of the core OS correlates with increased binding and bacterial sensitivity to PmB in vitro and reduced bacterial intracellular survival in macrophages.DISCUSSIONWe have identified gene loci responsible for the biosynthesis of the core OS moiety in B. cenocepacia K56-2. This allowed us to create a set of core OS-deficient mutants, three of which were used to determine the structure of the core OS. The mutant XOA3 has an insertional mutation in the wbxE gene that encodes a glycosyltransferase involved in O antigen synthesis, resulting in the production of lipid A-core OS and a partial O antigen unit (34Ortega X. Hunt T.A. Loutet S. Vinion-Dubiel A.D. Datta A. Choudhury B. Goldberg J.B. Carlson R. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1324-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This mutation recreates the same LPS phenotype as observed in strain J2315, whose structure has been recently reported (10Silipo A. Molinaro A. Ieranó T. De Soyza A. Sturiale L. Garozzo D. Aldridge C. Corris P.A. Khan C.M. Lanzetta R. Parrilli M. Chemistry. 2007; 13: 3501-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In J2315, the spontaneous insertion of the IS402 element in wbxE causes the formation of a lipid A-core OS with a partial O antigen repeat that cannot be polymerized (34Ortega X. Hunt T.A. Loutet S. Vinion-Dubiel A.D. Datta A. Choudhury B. Goldberg J.B. Carlson R. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1324-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The core OS structures in J2315 and XOA3 strains are identical, except for the presence of α-galactose instead of α-Glc linked to the outer core branched 3,7-disubstituted Hep. The galactose in the J2315 strain has an additional α-glucose at the O-6 position. The mutant XOA7, which has an inactivated waaL gene, lacks the terminal Rha-QuiNAc disaccharide found in the outer core OS of strains XOA3 and J2315 (10Silipo A. Molinaro A. Ieranó T. De Soyza A. Sturiale L. Garozzo D. Aldridge C. Corris P.A. Khan C.M. Lanzetta R. Parrilli M. Chemistry. 2007; 13: 3501-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). From these data, we conclude that the Rha-QuiNAc disaccharide is a remnant of the interrupted O antigen in these strains. The O antigen in B. cenocepacia K56-2 is synthesized via the ABC export pathway (4Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3285) Google Scholar, 34Ortega X. Hunt T.A. Loutet S. Vinion-Dubiel A.D. Datta A. Choudhury B. Goldberg J.B. Carlson R. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1324-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This particular mode of O antigen synthesis requires an adaptor sugar bound to undecaprenyl-PP, to which the remainder of the O antigen repeating units become attached (4Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3285) Google Scholar). Based on our structural information, combined with the mutagenesis data, we conclude that the QuiNAc residue is the adaptor sugar for the O antigen synthesis in B. cenocepacia K56-2. Furthermore, our data support the conclusion that the Β-d-QuiNAc-(1→7)-α-ld-Hep linkage is made by the WaaL O antigen ligase, explaining why the Rha-QuiNAc disaccharide is absent in strain XOA7. The terminal rhamnose in the core OS of the XOA3 mutant, is likely the first sugar of the repeating O unit, which we have previously established as a Rha-GalNAc-GalNAc trisaccharide (34Ortega X. Hunt T.A. Loutet S. Vinion-Dubiel A.D. Datta A. Choudhury B. Goldberg J.B. Carlson R. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1324-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but which cannot be completed because of the mutation in the WbxE glycosyltransferase. Therefore, our data also suggest that WbxE encodes a GalNAc transferase. Current work in our laboratories is under way to resolve the complete biosynthesis pathway of the O antigen component of the B. cenocepacia LPS.The structure of the core OS in the XOA8 strain revealed a major truncation, consistent with the migration pattern of the LPS in SDS-PAGE. The mutated wabO gene in XOA, encodes a putative glycosyltransferase, and based on the elucidated structure and the short lipid A-core OS band produced by the mutant strain, we predict that WabO protein is the glucosyltransferase responsible for the glucosylation of HepI (Fig. 4C). Also, the structural data suggest that glucosylation of HepI may be a requirement for the glucosylation of HepII and the continuation of the extension of the lipid A-core OS. Analysis of the LPS structure of XOA17, currently in progress in our laboratories, would be required to unequivocally support this conclusion.The composition of the lipid A moiety of B. cenocepacia K56-2 was identical to that of B. cepacia (8Silipo A. Molinaro A. Cescutti P. Bedini E. Rizzo R. Parrilli M. Lanzetta R. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 561-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and B. cenocepacia J2315 (10Silipo A. Molinaro A. Ieranó T. De Soyza A. Sturiale L. Garozzo D. Aldridge C. Corris P.A. Khan C.M. Lanzetta R. Parrilli M. Chemistry. 2007; 13: 3501-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the inner core OS is also composed of the trisaccharide Kdo-Ko-l-Ara4N, as described before (7Isshiki Y. Kawahara K. Zähringer U. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 313: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Isshiki Y. Zähringer U. Kawahara K. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 2659-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 10Silipo A. Molinaro A. Ieranó T. De Soyza A. Sturiale L. Garozzo D. Aldridge C. Corris P.A. Khan C.M. Lanzetta R. Parrilli M. Chemistry. 2007; 13: 3501-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). l-Ara4N is found as a nonstoichiometric substitution in the core OS of several bacteria such as Proteus penneri (43Holst O. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2007; 271: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The presence of l-Ara4N as a component of the core OS is unusual as this positively charged sugar is commonly found as a modification of the lipid A in response to specific environmental signals (4Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3285) Google Scholar), but it is rarely found as a component of the core OS. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the synthesis of l-Ara4N is essential for the viability of B. cenocepacia (19Ortega X.P. Cardona S.T. Brown A.R. Loutet S.A. Flannagan R.S. Campopiano D.J. Govan J.R. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 3639-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and more recently we have observed the same requirement for a B. cenocepacia mutant defective in the production of UDP-glucuronic acid, a precursor for UDP-l-Ara4N (44Loutet S.A. Bartholdson S.J. Govan J.R.W. Campopiano D.J. Valvano M.A. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 2029-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and speculated that the presence of l-Ara4N in the core OS may be critical for the completion of the synthesis or the assembly of the LPS. The presence of l-Ara4N linked to Ko is not universal to all Burkholderia, as it has been recently shown that a heptose residue is located at this position in the core OS of “B. cepacia” serotype O4 (45Masoud H. Perry M.B. Brisson J.R. Uhrin D. Li J. Richards J.C. Glycobiology. 2009; 19: 462-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This strain also has a very different core OS structure than the ones we have determined for B. cenocepacia ET12 strains. Unfortunately, given the heterogeneity of the genus Burkholderia (46Coenye T. Vandamme P. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), the lack of a detailed taxonomical assignment for B. cepacia serotype O4 makes it difficult to compare with other strains. The presence of the Kdo analog Ko is also unusual. Ko has also been found as a substitute for Kdo II in the LPS of Yersinia pestis and Serratia marcescens and for Kdo I in the LPS of Acinetobacter haemolyticus (5Caroff M. Karibian D. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 2431-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), but the function of such substitution and its biosynthesis are unknown (43Holst O. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2007; 271: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the LPS of other Burkholderia species such as B. caryophylli do not contain Ko (11Molinaro A. De Castro C. Lanzetta R. Evidente A. Parrilli M. Holst O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10058-10063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 47Molinaro A. Lindner B. De Castro C. Nolting B. Silipo A. Lanzetta R. Parrilli M. Holst O. Chemistry. 2003; 9: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).A heptoseless mutant of B. cepacia has been reported as a result of a mutation of the heptosyltransferase I waaC (48Gronow S. Noah C. Blumenthal A. Lindner B. Brade H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1647-1655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The structure of the core OS for this mutant is the same as the one we have determined for the B. cenocepacia K56-2 heptoseless mutant SAL1 6S. A. Loutet and M. A. Valvano, unpublished observations. (15Loutet S.A. Flannagan R.S. Kooi C. Sokol P.A. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2073-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, the inner core OS is highly conserved in Burkholderia species.The panel of isogenic strains with gradual truncations in their lipid A-core OS allowed us to investigate the relationship between LPS and the extraordinary resistance of B. cenocepacia against cationic APs. Although, as it was shown previously with B. cepacia (49Moore R.A. Hancock R.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1986; 30: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), PmB binds to P. aeruginosa much better than to B. cenocepacia K56-2, progressive truncation of the lipid A-core OS leads to increased PmB binding. These findings support the notion that the cell envelope of B. cenocepacia has unusual characteristics that enable it to act as a barrier against APs. Although significantly more sensitive than the wild type strain to PmB, our core mutants are still much more resistant to PmB than other organisms such as Salmonella and E. coli with intact core OS. Thus B. cenocepacia must possess additional mechanisms that make these bacteria extremely resistant to APs.Taking advantage of the set of isogenic mutants in B. cenocepacia K56-2 that range from the formation of a full-length LPS O antigen (parental strain) to a mutant producing heptoseless lipid A-core OS (CCB1), we also investigated the biological role of LPS in adhesion to epithelial cells and intracellular survival in macrophages. Our results demonstrated that O antigen production by B. cenocepacia prevents bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells. This suggests that the O antigen in these bacteria masks bacterial surface molecules that can interact with epithelial cell receptors, or alternatively, the exposed core OS residues are themselves ligands for binding. We considered the latter hypothesis less likely given that all the core OS mutants with progressive truncations showed increased adhesion, suggesting that no specific sugar residue is required for adhesion, in contrast to recent observations in other bacteria (50Hoare A. Bittner M. Carter J. Alvarez S. Zaldívar M. Bravo D. Valvano M.A. Contreras I. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 1555-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It has been previously shown that Bcc isolates can survive intracellularly within amoebae (51Marolda C.L. Hauröder B. John M.A. Michel R. Valvano M.A. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1509-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), respiratory epithelial cells (38Burns J.L. Jonas M. Chi E.Y. Clark D.K. Berger A. Griffith A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4054-4059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and macrophages (39Saini L.S. Galsworthy S.B. John M.A. Valvano M.A. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3465-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 40Lamothe J. Huynh K.K. Grinstein S. Valvano M.A. Cell. Microbiol. 2007; 9: 40-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Others have reported that the LPS O antigen plays an essential role in internalization and survival of the related bacterium B. pseudomallei in macrophages (52Arjcharoen S. Wikraiphat C. Pudla M. Limposuwan K. Woods D.E. Sirisinha S. Utaisincharoen P. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 4298-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our data investigating the ability of the various mutants with defects in lipid A-core OS production to survive intracellularly in macrophages revealed that only the heptoseless mutant CCB1 is impaired for survival. These results are somewhat surprising and indicate that the ability of B. cenocepacia to survive in macrophages does not correlate with the level of truncation of the core OS. B. cenocepacia can resist oxidative (53Keith K.E. Hynes D.W. Sholdice J.E. Valvano M.A. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 1004-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 54Bylund J. Burgess L.A. Cescutti P. Ernst R.K. Speert D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2526-2532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and nonoxidative (55Speert D.P. Bond M. Woodman R.C. Curnutte J.T. J. Infect. Dis. 1994; 170: 1524-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) intracellular killing mechanisms, and the latter mainly depend on APs. Therefore, the intracellular survival of the other mutants with core OS truncations, despite their increased sensitivity to PmB in vitro, suggest that either the AP concentration in BcCVs is not enough to compromise the viability of these mutants or other factors are involved. It is possible that the ability of B. cenocepacia to survive intracellularly is highly dependent on the stability of the outer membrane cell envelope, which may be only seriously perturbed in the presence of a drastically truncated lipid A-core OS. This is in agreement with other observations indicating that B. cenocepacia heptoseless mutants have defects in motility and increased permeability to other hydrophobic compounds in addition to antimicrobial peptides (15Loutet S.A. Flannagan R.S. Kooi C. Sokol P.A. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2073-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).6In conclusion, we have identified the genes involved in the biosynthesis of the core OS in B. cenocepacia, performed the structural analysis of the core OS, and assigned function to most of the genes of the core OS loci. We also demonstrated that progressive truncations of core OS are associated with a dramatic reduction in the resistance to PmB, which inversely correlates with increasing binding of this peptide to the bacterial cell envelope of the mutant strains. Finally, we also show that the majority of the core OS is expendable for intracellular survival of B. cenocepacia in macrophages, whereas the O antigen contributes to prevent bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells. Further investigations are underway in our laboratories to better elucidate the characteristic of the outer membrane and the LPS molecules that contribute to the extraordinary resistance of B. cenocepacia to a wide range of antimicrobial molecules, including APs.

https://openalex.org/W2068088132,"Patients presenting with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are treated with a standard anthracycline-based chemotherapeutic mixture consisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP). Half of DLBCL patients will develop chemo-refractory tumors due to the emergence of CHOP-resistant DLBCL cells. We isolated DLBCL cells that were resistant to CHOP as a model system to investigate the molecular basis of CHOP resistance. Resistant cells emerged from CHOP-sensitive DLBCL populations after repeated cycles of on-off exposure to stepwise increased dosages of CHOP. A proteomic analysis of CHOP-sensitive and -resistant DLBCL cells identified the zeta isoform of the 14-3-3 family as a differentially expressed protein. CHOP-sensitive cells showed reduced expression of 14-3-3zeta protein in the presence of high-dose CHOP relative to control cells. In contrast, CHOP-resistant cells expressed markedly higher levels of 14-3-3zeta regardless the presence of high-dose CHOP. Because 14-3-3zeta is known to exert anti-apoptotic influences and chemoresistance in lung, colon, and prostate carcinoma, we hypothesized that 14-3-3zeta promotes survival of DLBCL cells in CHOP. In support of our hypothesis, knockdown of 14-3-3zeta by small interfering RNA restored the sensitivity of resistant DLBCL to CHOP-induce apoptosis. In addition, 14-3-3zeta expression was highly up-regulated in a resected DLBCL lymph node relative to a normal lymph node by Western blot analysis. Furthermore, more than half of 35 DLBCL tissues showed elevated 14-3-3zeta expression relative to normal lymph tissue by immunohistochemical analysis. Our study implicates 14-3-3zeta in the pathogenesis of DLBCL and suggests a promising combination strategy with a 14-3-3 inhibitor for the treatment of refractory DLBCL."
https://openalex.org/W1988123037,"Cu(+)-ATPases drive the efflux of Cu(+) from the cell cytoplasm. During their catalytic/transport cycle, cytoplasmic Cu(+)-chaperones deliver the metal to the two transmembrane metal-binding sites (TM-MBSs) responsible for Cu(+) translocation. Here, using Archaeoglobus fulgidus Cu(+)-ATPase CopA and the C-terminal Cu(+)-chaperone domain of CopZ (Ct-CopZ), we describe the mechanism of Cu(+) transfer to both TM-MBSs. In absence of other ligands, Ct-CopZ transfers Cu(+) to wild-type CopA and to various CopA constructs lacking or having mutated cytoplasmic metal-binding domains, in a fashion consistent with occupancy of a single TM-MBS. Similar experiments performed in the presence of 2.5 mm ADP-Mg(2+), stabilizing an E1.ADP, lead to full occupancy of both TM-MBSs. In both cases, the transfer is largely stoichiometric, i.e. equimolar amounts of Ct-CopZ.Cu(+) saturated the TM-MBSs. Experiments performed with CopA mutants lacking either TM-MBS showed that both sites are loaded independently, and nucleotide binding does not affect their availability. The nucleotide-induced E2-->E1 transition is structurally characterized by a large displacement of the A and N domains opening the cytoplasmic region of P-type ATPases. Then, it is apparent that, whereas the first Cu(+)-chaperone can bind an ATPase form available in the absence of ligands, the second requires the E1.nucleotide intermediary to interact and deliver the metal. Interestingly, independent of TM-MBS Cu(+) loading, nucleotide binding also prevents the regulatory interaction of the N-terminal cytoplasmic metal-binding domain with the nucleotide binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W2149958207,"Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) proteins, which are present in all kingdoms of life, catalyze the sequence-independent hydrolysis of the bifurcated nucleic acid intermediates formed during DNA replication and repair. How FEN1s have evolved to preferentially cleave flap structures is of great interest especially in light of studies wherein mice carrying a catalytically deficient FEN1 were predisposed to cancer. Structural studies of FEN1s from phage to human have shown that, although they share similar folds, the FEN1s of higher organisms contain a 3'-extrahelical nucleotide (3'-flap) binding pocket. When presented with 5'-flap substrates having a 3'-flap, archaeal and eukaryotic FEN1s display enhanced reaction rates and cleavage site specificity. To investigate the role of this interaction, a kinetic study of human FEN1 (hFEN1) employing well defined DNA substrates was conducted. The presence of a 3'-flap on substrates reduced Km and increased multiple- and single turnover rates of endonucleolytic hydrolysis at near physiological salt concentrations. Exonucleolytic and fork-gap-endonucleolytic reactions were also stimulated by the presence of a 3'-flap, and the absence of a 3'-flap from a 5'-flap substrate was more detrimental to hFEN1 activity than removal of the 5'-flap or introduction of a hairpin into the 5'-flap structure. hFEN1 reactions were predominantly rate-limited by product release regardless of the presence or absence of a 3'-flap. Furthermore, the identity of the stable enzyme product species was deduced from inhibition studies to be the 5'-phosphorylated product. Together the results indicate that the presence of a 3'-flap is the critical feature for efficient hFEN1 substrate recognition and catalysis."

Although the influence of the photoperiod on heading has been extensively reported in rice, the molecular mechanism for the temperature control of heading remains unknown. This study reports an early heading mutant derived from tissue culture lines of rice and investigates the heading-date of wild type and mutant in different photoperiod and temperature treatments. The linkage analysis showed that the mutant phenotype cosegregated with the Hd1 locus. Sequencing analysis found that the mutant contained two insertions and several single-base substitutions that caused a dramatic reduction in Hd1mRNA levels compared with wild type. The expression patterns of Hd1 and Hd3a were also analyzed in different photoperiod and temperature conditions, revealing that Hd1 mRNA levels displayed similar expression patterns for different photoperiod and temperature treatments, with high expression levels at night and reduced levels in the daytime. In addition, Hd1 displayed a slightly higher expression level under long-day and low temperature conditions. Hd3a mRNA was present at a very low level under low temperature conditions regardless of the day-length. This result suggests that suppression of Hd3a expression is a principle cause of late heading under low temperature and long-day conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1985884124,"Non-covalent and covalent homo-oligomerization of membrane proteins regulates their subcellular localization and function. Here, we described a novel oligomerization mechanism affecting solute carrier family 30 member 3/zinc transporter 3 (SLC30A3/ZnT3). Oligomerization was mediated by intermolecular covalent dityrosine bonds. Using mutagenized ZnT3 expressed in PC12 cells, we identified two critical tyrosine residues necessary for dityrosine-mediated ZnT3 oligomerization. ZnT3 carrying the Y372F mutation prevented ZnT3 oligomerization, decreased ZnT3 targeting to synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMVs), and decreased resistance to zinc toxicity. Strikingly, ZnT3 harboring the Y357F mutation behaved as a “gain-of-function” mutant as it displayed increased ZnT3 oligomerization, targeting to SLMVs, and increased resistance to zinc toxicity. Single and double tyrosine ZnT3 mutants indicate that the predominant dimeric species is formed between tyrosine 357 and 372. ZnT3 tyrosine dimerization was detected under normal conditions and it was enhanced by oxidative stress. Covalent species were also detected in other SLC30A zinc transporters localized in different subcellular compartments. These results indicate that covalent tyrosine dimerization of a SLC30A family member modulates its subcellular localization and zinc transport capacity. We propose that dityrosine-dependent membrane protein oligomerization may regulate the function of diverse membrane protein in normal and disease states."

The precise mechanisms by which TNR expansion occurs and the factors that promote it are not fully understood. It has been proposed that CAG and CTG repeats form thermostable hairpins that include A-A and T-T mispairs in the hairpin stem (4Gacy A.M. Goellner G. Juraniæ N. Macura S. McMurray C.T.

Recent studies have identified and characterized a DNA hairpin repair (HPR) system in human cells that promotes CAG/CTG repeat stability (6Hou C. Chan N. Gu L. Li G.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 10.1038/nsmb.1638PubMed Google Scholar, 7Panigrahi G.B. Lau R. Montgomery S.E. Leonard M.R. Pearson C.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The mechanism of human HPR involves incision and removal of CAG/CTG repeat hairpins in a nick-directed and proliferating cell nuclear antigen-dependent manner, followed by DNA resynthesis using the continuous strand as a template (6Hou C. Chan N. Gu L. Li G.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 10.1038/nsmb.1638PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to human HPR, the human mismatch repair (MMR) system is well known for its role in stabilizing simple repetitive sequences called microsatellites, which are prone to forming small loops or insertion/deletion (ID) mispairs. In human cells, MutSα (MSH2–MSH6) and MutSβ (MSH2–MSH3) both bind to 1–2-nt ID mispairs, but MutSβ has higher affinity for these small loops (8Tian L. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol.

Surprisingly, genetic studies in mice suggest that MutSβ promotes (CAG)n expansion and TNR instability. These studies show that expansion of a heterologous (CAG)n tract occurs in wild type and MSH6−/− mice but that expansion of the (CAG)n tract is suppressed in MSH2−/− and MSH3−/− mice (10Manley K.

It is therefore hypothesized that (CAG)n hairpins, through their ability to alter the biochemical properties of MutSβ, hijack the MMR process, leading to CAG repeat expansion instead of CAG hairpin removal (11Owen B.A. Yang Z. Lai M. Gajec M. Badger 2nd, J.D. Hayes J.J. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Wilson T.M. McMurray C.T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear why MMR, a major genome maintenance system, would promote TNR instability instead of TNR stability. We, therefore, have developed a novel functional assay and examined the validity of this hypothesis. Our results reveal that MutSβ displays normal biochemical activities when binding to CAG hairpins and does not inhibit (CAG)n hairpin repair. The observations presented here provide novel thoughts on whether or not or how MutSβ is involved in CAG repeat instability in human cells. Oligonucleotide duplexes containing (5′-CAG-3′)35/(3′-GTC-5′)35, (5′-CTG-3′)35/(3′-GAC-5′)35, (5′-CAG-3′)10/(3′-GTC-5′)10, or (5′-CTG-3′)10/(3′-GAC-5′)10 were cloned into EcoRI and HindIII sites of bacterial phage M13mp18-UKY replication form (RF) DNA (13Guo S.

Individual derivatives were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To obtain a DNA heteroduplex containing a (CAG)25 hairpin in the complementary (C) strand, M13mp18-UKY-(CTG)35 RF DNA was first linearized with BglI and PvuI and then hybridized with M13mp18-UKY-(CTG)10 single-stranded viral (V) DNA. This hybridization forms a heteroduplex containing a (CAG)25 hairpin in the C strand and a 29-nucleotide gap 5′ to the hairpin. This substrate was designated 5′ C-(CAG)25, meaning that it contains a (CAG)25 hairpin in the C strand and a 29-nt single-strand gap 5′ to the heterology (see Fig. 1, top right diagram). Conversely, substrate 5′ V-(CTG)25 has a (CTG)25 hairpin in the V strand and a 29-nt gap 5′ to the hairpin (see Fig. 1, top left diagram) and was derived from hybridization of M13mp18-UKY-(CTG)35 viral single-stranded DNA and M13mp18-UKY-(CTG)10 RF double-stranded DNA digested with BglI and PvuI. HeLa S3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 4 mm glutamine at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (13Guo S.

MutSα and MutSβ proteins were expressed in insect cells, purified to near homogeneity, and examined for MMR activity as described (14Zhang Y. Yuan F. Presnell S.R. Tian K. Gao Y. Tomkinson A.E. Gu L. Li G.M. Cell. 2005; 122: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). DNA HPR assays were performed in a 40-μl reaction containing 200 ng of DNA substrate, 100 μg of HeLa nuclear extract, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 110 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm ATP, 1 mm glutathione, and 0.1 mm dNTP in the presence or absence of MutSα or MutSβ. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, DNA products were purified, digested with Bsu36I and PstI, and separated on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel followed by electro-transferring to nylon membrane. The membrane was probed with a 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide specifically annealing to the 3′-end of the Bsu36I-PstI fragment in the C strand to score for conversion of 35 CAG/CTG repeats to 10 CAG/CTG repeats or vice versa. Repair products, as well as unrepaired molecules, were visualized by exposing to x-ray film. Gel-shift assays were performed in 20-μl reactions containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 110 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 32P-labeled oligonucleotide duplexes, and MutSβ in the presence of 10-fold excess amount of unlabeled oligonucleotide homoduplex. The reactions were incubated on ice for 20 min followed by the addition of 5 μl of 50% (w/v) sucrose. Samples were loaded on and separated by electrophoresis through a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in buffer containing 50 mm Tris borate (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA. The buffer was recirculated during electrophoresis. The gel was dried and analyzed by a Storm PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). The nucleotide cross-linking assays were performed essentially as described (8Tian L. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11557-11562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Mazur D.J. Mendillo M.L. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Reactions were assembled and incubated on ice in nucleotide binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 110 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol in the presence or absence of 5 mm MgCl2. Where specified, DNA heteroduplex or homoduplex was added 10 min prior to the addition of nucleotide. MutSβ was mixed with [α-32P]ATP, [α-32P]ADP, or [γ-32P]ATP and incubated for 10 min. Samples were then subjected to 10 min of UV cross-linking (Stratalinker) followed immediately by fractionation by 8% SDS-PAGE gel. Radiolabeled bands were quantified using a PhosphorImager. [α-32P]ADP was generated by incubating [α-32P]ATP with hexokinase and purified as described (15Mazur D.J. Mendillo M.L. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). ATPase activity of MutSβ was assayed in 20-μl reactions containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 110 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.05–100 μm [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the reactions were terminated and fractionated through a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. 32P-containing species were detected by a PhosphorImager. Repair of DNA hairpins formed within CAG and CTG TNRs has recently been characterized in human cells (6Hou C. Chan N. Gu L. Li G.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 10.1038/nsmb.1638PubMed Google Scholar, 7Panigrahi G.B. Lau R. Montgomery S.E. Leonard M.R. Pearson C.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The HPR system removes (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpins by incisions in a nick-directed, proliferating cell nuclear antigen-dependent, and error-free manner (6Hou C. Chan N. Gu L. Li G.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 10.1038/nsmb.1638PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether MutSβ hijacks (CAG)n HPR, a functional in vitro assay was used to examine the catalytic competence of MutSβ in repair of a (CAG)25 hairpin in the gapped strand and a (CTG)25 hairpin in the non-gapped strand by HeLa nuclear extracts. In this assay, the DNA substrate is incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts in the presence or absence of excess exogenous human MutSβ. Because HPR is always targeted to the nicked/gapped DNA strand (6Hou C. Chan N. Gu L. Li G.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 10.1038/nsmb.1638PubMed Google Scholar, 7Panigrahi G.B. Lau R. Montgomery S.E. Leonard M.R. Pearson C.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), repair can be readily scored by monitoring changes in the length of the nicked/gapped strand of the DNA substrate using a 32P-labeled probe (6Hou C. Chan N. Gu L. Li G.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 10.1038/nsmb.1638PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). As expected, both substrates were efficiently repaired by HeLa nuclear extracts, with the repair being targeted in the gapped strand. Incubation of HeLa nuclear extracts with the (CTG)25 substrate, whose hairpin is located in the continuous strand (Fig. 1, left panel), yielded two major novel bands (Fig. 1, lane 2), i.e. the repair product (top band, 19%) and the unrepaired but gap-filled and/or gapped-ligated substrate (middle band). The repair product is 75 nt longer than the gap-ligated substrate, indicating that the continuous strand was used as a template for repair DNA synthesis. Similarly, processing of substrate C-(CAG)25 (containing a hairpin in the gapped strand) by HeLa extracts generated a repair product (lane 10, middle band, 22%) that is 75 nt shorter than the gap-ligated unrepaired substrate (lane 10, top band), consistent with the notion that HPR is targeted to the nicked/gapped strand (6Hou C. Chan N. Gu L. Li G.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 10.1038/nsmb.1638PubMed Google Scholar, 7Panigrahi G.B. Lau R. Montgomery S.E. Leonard M.R. Pearson C.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It is worth mentioning that the repair product, which no longer contains a (CAG)25 hairpin in the C strand, migrates slower than the original substrate; this is because the (CAG)25 hairpin-containing PstI-PvuI fragment (i.e. the size of the original substrate shown in Fig. 1, lanes 9–16) is 32 nt shorter than the PstI-Bsu36I fragment without a (CAG)25 hairpin (the size of the repair product). Surprisingly, when excess exogenous human MutSβ, which is very active in repair of insertion/deletion mispairs in a defined MMR system (data not shown and Ref. 14Zhang Y. Yuan F. Presnell S.R. Tian K. Gao Y. Tomkinson A.E. Gu L. Li G.M. Cell. 2005; 122: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), was preincubated with the DNA substrate prior to assembling the complete reaction, there was no reduction or inhibition of either (CAG)25 or (CTG)25 HPR. Instead, the repair was 1.1–1.7-fold higher in the presence of MutSβ (Fig. 1, lanes 6–8 for the CTG hairpin and lanes 14–16 for the CAG hairpin). This surprising result suggests that MutSβ facilitates (CAG)n and (CTG)n HPR, likely through interactions with these hairpins. In addition, the extent of repair did not decrease when the DNA substrate was incubated with MutSβ and HeLa nuclear extract at the same time (data not shown). Similar results were also obtained with MutSα (Fig. 1, lanes 3–5 and 11–13). These observations show that neither MutSα nor MutSβ inhibits (CAG)n or (CTG)n HPR in this in vitro assay. To determine whether MutSβ interacts with (CAG)n and (CTG)n hairpins, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis was performed using purified MutSβ and a (CAG)13 hairpin (11Owen B.A. Yang Z. Lai M. Gajec M. Badger 2nd, J.D. Hayes J.J. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Wilson T.M. McMurray C.T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and a (CTG)13 hairpin substrates. As shown in Fig. 2A, MutSβ binds both (CAG)13 (lane 9) and (CTG)13 (lane 12) hairpins with a Kd of 26 and 22, respectively, which is similar to the Kd (23Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) for an ID substrate (lane 15). It is known that mismatch binding by MutSα leads to an ATP-provoked conformational change that allows the protein to be released from the DNA (16Drummond J.T. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 17Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol.

To determine whether hairpin binding alters MutSβ biophysical properties as proposed (11Owen B.A. Yang Z. Lai M. Gajec M. Badger 2nd, J.D. Hayes J.J. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Wilson T.M. McMurray C.T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), gel-shift analysis was performed in the presence of ATP. As shown in Fig. 2B, ATP inhibits both the MutSβ-ID and the MutSβ-(CAG)13 hairpin interactions (lanes 3 and 6), suggesting that MutSβ undergoes an ATP-induced conformational change whether it is bound to a (CAG)13 hairpin or to an ID mispair. All MutS proteins possess a weak ATPase activity and a nucleotide (ATP and ADP) binding activity (9Li G.M. Cell Res. 2008; 18: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that binding of MutSα to a mismatch enhances its ATPase and ATP binding activities (17Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 18Mendillo M.L. Mazur D.J. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22245-22257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the MutSβ-ID interaction reduces MutSβ ATPase activity (8Tian L. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11557-11562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effects of ID and hairpin heteroduplexes on MutSβ ATPase. As shown in Fig. 3A, MutSβ displays an identical reduction in ATPase activity (from 100% in the absence of DNA to 66% in the presence of heteroduplexes) regardless of its interaction with a (CAG)13 hairpin, a (CTG)13 hairpin, or an ID heteroduplex (compare lane 2 with lanes 4–6). Kinetic studies revealed that although the kcat value (13.9 min−1) for the ID substrate is higher than that (11.3 min−1) for the CAG or CTG hairpin substrate (Fig. 3A), which appears to be in agreement with the data reported previously (11Owen B.A. Yang Z. Lai M. Gajec M. Badger 2nd, J.D. Hayes J.J. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Wilson T.M. McMurray C.T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), the catalytic efficiencies, kcat/kM, for the individual DNA substrates used are almost the same, 3.32 for CAG hairpin, 3.39 for CTG hairpin, and 3.5 for ID heteroduplex (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the reduction in MutSβ ATPase activity induced by DNA is not specific or unique to the (CAG)13 or (CTG)13 hairpin structure. MutSβ nucleotide binding affinity was determined by performing UV cross-linking experiments (8Tian L. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11557-11562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Mazur D.J. Mendillo M.L. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The results show that all DNA heteroduplexes, including a CAG hairpin and an ID mispair, inhibit binding of MutSβ to ATP by 60% in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 3B, upper panel, also see quantitative data in supplemental Table 1). In the presence of Mg2+, DNA substrates no longer inhibit MutSβ-ATP interactions (Fig. 3B, lower panel), leading to an enhanced (2–3-fold) ATP binding (see supplemental Table 1). This is consistent with the fact that DNA substrates inhibit MutSβ ATPase activity (Fig. 3A) (8Tian L. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11557-11562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fig. 3C shows similar analysis for ADP. Again, the type of DNA substrates has no effects on ADP binding, but Mg2+ stimulates binding of MutSβ to ADP, particularly the MSH3 subunit (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 6–10 with lanes 1–5, also see supplemental Table 1), which differs from MutSα and its MSH6 subunit (8Tian L. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11557-11562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Mazur D.J. Mendillo M.L. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest that binding to a (CAG)n or a (CTG)n hairpin does not alter the nucleotide binding and ATPase activities of MutSβ, which are associated with its function in MMR. A previous study (11Owen B.A. Yang Z. Lai M. Gajec M. Badger 2nd, J.D. Hayes J.J. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Wilson T.M. McMurray C.T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) reported that “CAG-hairpin binding inhibits the ATPase activity of Msh2–Msh3 and alters both nucleotide (ADP and ATP) affinity and binding interfaces between protein and DNA.” These alterations are considered “critical functional defects in the Msh2–Msh3-CAG hairpin complex that could misdirect the DNA repair process,” i.e. “the aberrant enzymatic and/or structural properties of the Msh2–Msh3-hairpin DNA complex may divert the repair process to other non-MMR pathway, leading to expansion instead of repair” (11Owen B.A. Yang Z. Lai M. Gajec M. Badger 2nd, J.D. Hayes J.J. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Wilson T.M. McMurray C.T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, the results presented here demonstrate that MutSβ exhibits identical biochemical and biophysical activities, including nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (Fig. 3), and ATP-induced conformational change and protein translocation/sliding when MutSβ interacts with its favored ID mispair or a CAG/CTG hairpin (Fig. 2B). More convincingly, our functional in vitro HPR assays reveal that excess MutSβ does not inhibit CAG/CTG hairpin removal (Fig. 1). Therefore, binding to CAG hairpins does not alter MutSβ MMR activities and has no inhibitory roles in CAG HPR. Although the discrepancy between these studies requires further investigations, we did identify the following differences: (i) the previous study was performed with a recombinant His-tagged MutSβ, whereas the present study was performed with a preparation of MutSβ that lacks an epitope tag and (ii) the MutSβ protein used in the present study is active in a functional MMR assay (data not shown and Ref. 14Zhang Y. Yuan F. Presnell S.R. Tian K. Gao Y. Tomkinson A.E. Gu L. Li G.M. Cell. 2005; 122: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), but the MutSβ protein used in the previous study was not tested for its MMR function. These factors may have contributed to the difference in these studies. We also found that data were analyzed differently in these two studies. For example, kcat and kcat/kM were used to evaluate MutSβ ATPase activity in the previous and current studies, respectively. Despite the fact that both studies show different kcat values for MutSβ ATPase activity when incubating with different DNA substrates, a much smaller difference was pronounced when kcat/kM values were used. A good example is that although Owens et al. (11Owen B.A. Yang Z. Lai M. Gajec M. Badger 2nd, J.D. Hayes J.J. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Wilson T.M. McMurray C.T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) observed a kcat value of 6.3 ± 0.2 and 5.0 ± 0.2 min−1 for a homoduplex and a CAG hairpin, respectively, the kcat/kM values for both substrates are essentially the same (1.9 × 105 min−1m−1), indicating that there is little difference in MutSβ ATPase activity when the protein interacts with these DNA substrates, a conclusion of the current study. It is worth mentioning that although kcat is frequently used to express enzyme activity, the term kcat/kM, referred to as the catalytic efficiency, is often employed as a specificity constant to compare the relative rates of the same enzyme reacting with different substrates (19Eisenthal R. Danson M.J. Hough D.W. Trends Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 247-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 20Johnson K.A. Sigman D.S. The Enzymes. 20.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We found that the latter is very useful to determine MutSβ ATPase activities because the kcat/kM values accurately reflect the observed ATP hydrolysis when MutSβ was incubated with different DNA substrates (Fig. 3A). We also realize that differential interpretations of the existing data contribute to the distinct conclusions in these two studies. Both studies have shown inhibition of the MutSβ ATPase activity by DNA substrates, which completely differs from the well documented property of MutSα or Escherichia coli MutS, whose ATPase activity is stimulated by DNA substrates (23Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Bowers J. Sokolsky T. Quach T. Alani E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 3922-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As a result, MutSβ was thought to have altered its activities when interacting with a CAG hairpin in the hijacking model (11Owen B.A. Yang Z. Lai M. Gajec M. Badger 2nd, J.D. Hayes J.J. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Wilson T.M. McMurray C.T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 12McMurray C.T. DNA Repair. 2008; 7: 1121-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our recent studies (8Tian L. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11557-11562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have revealed significant differences in the biochemical functions between MutSα and MutSβ during recognition and interaction with base-base and ID mismatches. For example, MutSβ binds ADP with higher affinity than MutSα, and DNA substrates partially inhibit MutSβ ATPase activity but stimulate MutSα ATPase activity (8Tian L. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11557-11562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A more recent study by Owens et al. (26Owen B.A. Lang W.H. McMurray C.T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) also revealed some of these distinct properties between MutSα and MutSβ. Taken together, we believe that the distinct properties of MutSβ from MutSα are specific for its recognition of ID heteroduplexes (8Tian L. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11557-11562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) but did not result from its binding to CAG hairpins (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3 in this study). Therefore, it is not appropriate to use MutSα properties to interpret MutSβ behaviors. In summary, both our previous studies and the data presented here support a notion that binding of (CAG)n hairpin by MutSβ does not interfere with (CAG)n HPR in vitro. These observations strongly suggest that the hijacking model (11Owen B.A. Yang Z. Lai M. Gajec M. Badger 2nd, J.D. Hayes J.J. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Wilson T.M. McMurray C.T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 12McMurray C.T. DNA Repair. 2008; 7: 1121-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) may not be practical for the involvement of MutSβ in CAG repeat instability shown in transgenic mice (10Manley K. Shirley T.L. Flaherty L. Messer A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 11Owen B.A. Yang Z. Lai M. Gajec M. Badger 2nd, J.D. Hayes J.J. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Wilson T.M. McMurray C.T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Our results presented here raise many questions on this issue. Does the transgenic mouse model of CAG repeats truly reflect CAG repeat expansion in human cells, i.e. does MutSβ indeed promote CAG repeat expansions in humans? If it does, why and how does such a microsatellite stabilization system promote microsatellite (i.e. CAG repeats) instability? A recent study by Lin et al. (27Lin Y. Dion V. Wilson J.H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 179-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) suggests that MutSβ may influence CAG repeat instability via transcription; however, the mechanism is unclear. Therefore, thorough investigations are required to elucidate the mechanism of TNR expansions in specific human diseases, as well as the potential in vivo role of MutSβ or other DNA repair proteins in this process.

The ubiquitous nature of the acidic transactivation domain of p53 in mediating interactions with several transcription cofactors is also manifested as a DNA mimetic. The tumor suppressor p53 regulates the expression of numerous target genes involved in cell cycle arrest and DNA repair through interaction with various proteins. Interaction of p53 with cellular proteins is essential for its transcriptional activity, stability, or specificity in DNA binding (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5707) Google Scholar). p53 is composed of four structural/functional domains as follows: an N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD), 3The abbreviations used are: TADtransactivation domainssDNAsingle-stranded DNACTDC-terminal regulatory domainITCisothermal titration calorimetryGSTglutathione S-transferaseRPAreplication protein AmsSSBmitochondrial ssDNA (mtSSB)-binding protein. 3The abbreviations used are: TADtransactivation domainssDNAsingle-stranded DNACTDC-terminal regulatory domainITCisothermal titration calorimetryGSTglutathione S-transferaseRPAreplication protein AmsSSBmitochondrial ssDNA (mtSSB)-binding protein. a central DNA-binding domain, a tetramerization domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain (CTD) (2Joerger A.C. Fersht A.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 557-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The p53 N-transactivation domain contains two subdomains TAD1-(1–40) and TAD2-(41–61). Many protein interactions are mediated with one or both of the TAD domains. The interaction between the N-terminal domain of MDM2 and TAD1 is very tight (3Schon O. Friedler A. Bycroft M. Freund S.M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 4Teufel D.P. Freund S.M. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7009-7014Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In contrast, the subdomains of p300 bind only weakly to the TAD1 region but with high affinity to a peptide containing the TAD1 and TAD2 region (4Teufel D.P. Freund S.M. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7009-7014Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Mutations in either TAD1 (L22Q/W23S = QS1) or TAD2 (W53Q/F54S = QS2) reduce transcriptional activation of p53, whereas the quadruple mutations QS1/QS2 completely abolish transcription (5Venot C.

Apart from its interaction with the basal transcription machinery, p53 interacts with other transcriptional cofactors such as JMY, Zac1, CBP/p300, and HMGB-1 (6Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Gardner K.

Recently, p53 was found also to interact with positive cofactor 4 (PC4), and this interaction activates it for specific DNA binding, enhancing its transcriptional activity (10Banerjee S. Kumar B.R. Kundu T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2052-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11Batta K. Kundu T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7603-7614Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Post-translational modifications of PC4 affect the DNA binding function of p53. Acetylation of PC4 enhances p53 DNA binding, and phosphorylation of PC4 abolishes this activity (11Batta K. Kundu T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7603-7614Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PC4 was initially identified as a transcriptional coactivator that mediates activator-dependent transcription of class II genes through interactions with the basal transcription machinery (12Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). It plays a vital role in several processes such as replication, transcription, DNA repair, and cell growth (12Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 13Pan Z.Q. Ge H. Amin A.A. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22111-22116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PC4 is composed of two domains with distinct functional properties, the N-terminal half of PC4-(1–60) and the DNA-binding C-terminal half of PC4 (PC4CTD-(61–126)). The human PC4CTD binds tightly to melted double-stranded DNA and ssDNA (14Werten S. Langen F.W. van Schaik R. Timmers H.T. Meisterernst M. van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Besides binding to DNA, PC4CTD is essential for interaction with several transcriptional activation domains, such as AP-2α and VP16 (15Zhong L. Wang Y. Kannan P. Tainsky M.A. Gene. 2003; 320: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Jonker H.R. Wechselberger R.W. Boelens R. Folkers G.E. Kaptein R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The binding of the acidic domain of VP16 to PC4CTD has been investigated in detail, and a structural model of the complex has been recently proposed (16Jonker H.R. Wechselberger R.W. Boelens R. Folkers G.E. Kaptein R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Jonker H.R. Wechselberger R.W. Boelens R. Kaptein R. Folkers G.E. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5067-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The acidic domains of VP16 and p53 share some degree of sequence similarity and are known to interact with common partners such as TATA-binding protein, the CREB-binding protein, the general transcription factor IIB (TFIIB), TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII31, and the p62/Tfb1 (human and yeast) subunit of the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) (18Langlois C. Mas C. Di Lello P. Jenkins L.M. Legault P. Omichinski J.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 10596-10604Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Both VP16 and p53 acidic domains are intrinsically disordered under physiological conditions, but an α-helix is induced upon binding to target proteins. Here we showed that the acidic transactivation domain of p53 interacts with the C-terminal domain of PC4 (PC4CTD). Using a combination of biophysical techniques, we identified the relevant binding sites in both p53 and PC4. To gain insight into the molecular basis of p53-PC4 interaction, we have modeled the p53TAD2-PC4CTD complex using a data-driven protein docking approach. Our model showed a good agreement with the results from mutational analysis and revealed that the p53 peptide acts as ssDNA mimic. We also discuss the general role of acidic transactivation domains as ssDNA mimics. cDNA of PC4 full-length and PC4CTD-(61–127) was cloned into a modified PET 24A vector encoding an N-terminal His6 tag, lipoyl domain, and a TeV cleavage site. Both PC4 and PC4CTD constructs were overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified by Ni2+-affinity column followed by TeV cleavage. Subsequent purification by SP-Sepharose and gel filtration on Superdex 75 yielded a purity of >99%. Full-length p53 and TAD-(1–93) were expressed and purified as described (19Yu G.W. Rudiger S. Veprintsev D. Freund S. Fernandez-Fernandez M.R. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1227-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). TAD-(1–93) was previously assigned (4Teufel D.P. Freund S.M. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7009-7014Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). 15N,1H HSQC spectra of free or bound TAD and PC4CTD were acquired on a Bruker (Karlsruhe DRX) 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance single-axis gradient probe, at 293 K. Resonance assignments for PC4CTD were taken from the published data (20Werten S. Wechselberger R. Boelens R. van der Vliet P.C. Kaptein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3693-3699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). TAD was labeled with Alexa Fluor 546 at a cysteine introduced at position 91. Fluorescence anisotropy titrations were carried out at 293 K as described (21Rajagopalan S. Jaulent A.M. Wells M. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5983-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The titration buffer was 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.2. ITC measurements were performed as described (19Yu G.W. Rudiger S. Veprintsev D. Freund S. Fernandez-Fernandez M.R. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1227-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Injection steps were 10 μl (first injection, 3 μl) with 250-s spacing. Data evaluation was done using the MicroCal OriginTM program. Peptides were synthesized and purified as described (4Teufel D.P. Freund S.M. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7009-7014Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated serines were used during synthesis. All peptides were C-terminally labeled with Lys-methoxycoumarin. Structures of two distinct fragments of the p53 N-transactivation domain, comprising residues 33–56 and residues 45–58, have been solved in a complex with replication protein A and Tfb1, respectively (18Langlois C.

In both complexes, the bound p53 transactivation domain forms an amphipathic α-helix. Residues 48–56 of both p53TAD fragments have a virtually identical conformation and superpose with a root mean square deviation of 0.6 Å. This region exhibits the most significant chemical shift changes upon binding to PC4CTD and therefore was used for modeling. Docking was performed using the crystal structure of PC4CTD (23Werten S. Moras D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 181-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For less ambiguity, only one of the DNA-binding interfaces of the dimeric PC4CTD was used. Initial docking, constrained by surface complementarity and electrostatics, was performed using FTDOCK (24Gabb H.A. Jackson R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 106-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Each possible complex was scored by using the RPSCORE program and an empirical pair potential matrix derived from nonhomologous interfaces observed in the Protein Data Bank. The high scoring docking models were analyzed. For refined docking the HADDOCK program was employed (25de Vries S.J. van Dijk A.D. Krzeminski M. van Dijk M. Thureau A. Hsu V. Wassenaar T. Bonvin A.M. Proteins. 2007; 69: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The ambiguous interaction restraints were chosen on the basis of chemical shift perturbation for p53TAD. Residues that constitute the DNA-binding site of PC4 were selected as restraints. These restraints were used as input for the HADDOCK program. Default parameters were used. 1000 independent rigid-body minimizations were performed leading to 1000 docked complexes. The 200 lowest intermolecular energy solutions were the subject of rigid-body simulated annealing followed by semi-flexible simulated annealing. The obtained structures were further refined in explicit solvent employing simulated annealing in Cartesian space. The resulting 200 complexes were clustered and scored according to their HADDOCK scores. The best scoring cluster contained 25 structures with a root mean square deviation from the lowest energy structure of 0.9 ± 0.6 Å. To determine the binding sites on the p53 transactivation domain, we recorded 15N,1H HSQC spectra of p53TAD-(1–93) upon addition of PC4 (Fig. 1). Chemical shift changes were observed mainly for residues 35–57 of the TAD2 domain. In particular, residues 40–45 showed large chemical shift changes, whereas resonances corresponding to residues 50–55 disappeared in the complex. Similar chemical shift changes are observed when p53TAD binds to the TAZ2 domain of p300, human mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein, and replication protein A, suggesting that these residues can mediate interactions with different targets (4Teufel D.P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2061-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A few residues (Leu-22 and Trp-23) in the TAD1 domain also showed large chemical shift perturbations. To identify which region of PC4 interacts with p53TAD, we recorded 15N,1H HSQC spectra of TAD with full-length PC4 (PC4fl) and PC4 C-terminal domain (60–127 PC4CTD). The spectra of PC4fl-TAD and PC4CTD-TAD complex overlapped very well indicating that the C-terminal domain of PC4 interacts with p53TAD. ITC experiments showed that full-length p53 binds PC4 with Kd = 6 μm (Fig. 2). Previous studies, using GST pulldown assays, report that the DNA-binding and C-terminal domains of p53 are involved in interaction with PC4CTD (10Banerjee S. Kumar B.R. Kundu T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2052-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). ITC and NMR experiments showed no specific interactions with these domains. Having identified PC4CTD as the interacting domain, we tested whether the p53TAD and DNA compete for a common binding site on PC4. We recorded 15N,1H HSQC spectra of PC4CTD in the presence and absence of ssDNA (Fig. 3A). Resonance assignments of the PC4CTD and PC4CTD-DNA complex were reported previously (20Werten S. Wechselberger R. Boelens R. van der Vliet P.C. Kaptein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3693-3699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and most of the resonances in our spectra could be assigned unambiguously with the exception of a few peaks. Gly-79 and Asn-105 had significant changes in chemical shift upon ssDNA binding consistent with the previous observation. We also recorded 15N,1H HSQC spectra of PC4CTD in the presence of TAD (Fig. 3B). Most of the resonances that showed significant shifts in the PC4CTD-DNA complex were also shifted in the PC4CTD-p53N complex. Gly-79, Asn-105, and Leu-106 showed significant changes in chemical shifts. Resonances for Phe-64, Val-72, and Ser-73 could not be assigned unambiguously in the free PC4CTD. Two of these residues exhibited significant chemical shift change upon binding to TAD and were also perturbed in the PC4CTD-DNA complex. These results indicate that TAD and ssDNA may share the same binding interface on PC4CTD. To confirm this observation, we conducted competition anisotropy titration. The binding constant for PC4 to ssDNA was found to be 5 nm under experimental conditions. ssDNA was titrated into the TAD-PC4CTD complex, with p53N labeled with Alexa Fluor 546 at a cysteine introduced at position 91. As the ssDNA binds PC4CTD, labeled TAD is released into solution (Fig. 4). This experiment clearly showed that ssDNA and TAD compete for the same binding site on PC4CTD.FIGURE 4Fluorescence anisotropy competition assay. Unlabeled ssDNA was titrated into a solution containing Alexa Fluor 546-labeled TAD and PC4CTD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Upon stress, p53 is phosphorylated at multiple sites, and these phosphorylations are important for maintaining its cellular stability or for mediating interactions with other target proteins. Mutations of the phosphorylation sites have deleterious effects on the function of p53 (28Bode A.M. Dong Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). We recently showed that hepta-phosphorylated TAD-(10–57) had enhanced affinity for the CH3 domain of p300, while simultaneously decreasing MDM2 binding (29Teufel D.P. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 2112-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To test the effect of phosphorylation on the binding of p53TAD to PC4, we analyzed the binding of peptides singly phosphorylated at Ser-33, Thr-55, Ser-37, or Ser-46. All the peptides had dissociation constants of 5.8–6.9 μm. We also synthesized a peptide comprising residues 10–57 phosphorylated at Ser-15, Thr-18, Ser-20, Ser-33, Ser-37, Ser-46, and Thr-55. All these sites are phosphorylated in the active form of p53. This hepta-phosphorylated peptide (hPp53N) bound with a dissociation constant of 3 μm as compared with 8 μm for wild type (Fig. 5). This increase in affinity by about a factor of 3 is probably because of the nonspecific electrostatic interactions that are primarily dictated by the negative charges, and hence an increase in the total net charge leads to tighter binding. An aspartic acid mutant (hepta-mutant) of the peptide was synthesized, and it had a Kd of 5 μm, further supporting the fact that these interactions are electrostatically driven. Because of experimental limitations such as line broadening and disappearance of peaks, we were unable to solve the solution structure of the p53N-PC4 complex. Nevertheless, the chemical shift mapping data were sufficient as constraints in molecular docking. NMR titration experiments showed that the amide 1H and 15N shift toward lower parts/million values, whereas positive resonance shifts were observed for 13Cα indicating formation of an α-helix in otherwise intrinsically unstructured p53TAD2 (Fig. 6) (30Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar). Thus, p53TAD2 adopts mainly α-helical conformation when bound to PC4CTD, which is in agreement with the observed conformation of this region in complex with replication protein A (RPA) and Tfb1 (18Langlois C. Mas C. Di Lello P. Jenkins L.M. Legault P. Omichinski J.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 10596-10604Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Bochkareva E. Kaustov L. Ayed A. Yi G.S. Lu Y. Pineda-Lucena A. Liao J.C. Okorokov A.L. Milner J. Arrowsmith C.H. Bochkarev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15412-15417Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The most significant chemical shift perturbations upon p53TAD-PC4CTD complex formation involved residues 48–56 of p53TAD2 indicating these residues as key determinants for binding (Fig. 6). This region has identical conformations in both the p53TAD-RPA and the p53TAD-Tfb1 complexes and therefore was used in our docking experiments. Two different docking approaches were applied. Preliminary docking was performed using FTDOCK without using constraints (24Gabb H.A. Jackson R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 106-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Most of the high scoring complexes contained the p53 peptide docked to the DNA-binding site of PC4 suggesting that there is sufficient geometric and electrostatic complementarity between them. A refined model of the p53TAD-PC4 complex was obtained using the HADDOCK program (25de Vries S.J. van Dijk A.D. Krzeminski M. van Dijk M. Thureau A. Hsu V. Wassenaar T. Bonvin A.M. Proteins. 2007; 69: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Ambiguous interaction restraints for the p53TAD were defined on the basis of the chemical shift perturbations. In addition, the residues that constitute the DNA-binding interface of PC4 were used as restraints. The ensemble of the 25 energetically most favorable structures yielded 0.9 ± 0.6 Å root mean square deviation. The model of the complex is shown in Fig. 7. The peptide is positioned along the concave Β surface of PC4. The electrostatic surface of the PC4 DNA-binding site provides a suitable complementary environment for the acidic amino acids of p53TAD. Asp-49 and Glu-51 of p53 may participate in a salt bridge with Arg-100 and Lys-78, respectively. Lys-101 of PC4 interacts with the backbone carbonyl group of Glu-56. Residues Phe-54 and Ile-50 of the TAD make hydrophobic contact with the highly conserved Phe-77 of PC4. Phe-77 is involved in a stacking interaction with ssDNA, and mutation of this residue abolishes the DNA binding (31Werten S. Stelzer G. Goppelt A. Langen F.M. Gros P. Timmers H.T. van der Vliet P.C. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5103-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Notably, the mode of interaction between the p53 peptide and PC4 in the modeled complex is similar to the ssDNA binding to PC4 (23Werten S. Moras D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 181-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Phe-54 and Ile-50 are reminiscent of the DNA bases, whereas the backbone and side-chain carbonyl groups of p53TAD2 mimic the phosphate backbone of DNA (Fig. 8). In addition, Trp-53 is located near Arg-86. In the PC4-ssDNA complex, the latter binds simultaneously two water molecules and thereby positions them for hydrogen bond donation to the ssDNA phosphate group. In our modeled complex, this residue may form an essential cation-π interaction with Trp-53. Cation-π interactions are frequently found in protein-protein interfaces, and they contribute to the stability of the complex as much as any conventional interaction such as salt bridges or hydrogen bonds (32Gallivan J.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 9459-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar).FIGURE 7Docking model of PC4-p53TAD2 complex.

Based on the interactions observed in the modeled p53-PC4 complex, we synthesized two mutant peptides I50A/W53A/F54A p53N-(35–57) and D49K/E51K p53N-(35–57). Both peptides showed very weak binding of 42 and 22 μm, respectively. QS2 (W53Q/F54S) mutations have reduced transcriptional activation of apoptosis and cell cycle arresting gene (5Venot C. Maratrat M. Sierra V. Conseiller E. Debussche L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2405-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We tested the binding of QS2 mutant peptide W53Q/F54S p53N-(10–57) to PC4 and found it had a 2-fold decrease in affinity. In addition to the residues identified in the modeled complex, several other hydrophobic and acidic residues had some changes in chemical shift upon PC4 binding. To investigate the role of these residues and their contribution to the binding, we made peptides bearing the following mutations: L43A/L45A/I50A/W53A/F54A p53N-(35–57) and D41K/D42K/D48K/D49K/E51K p53N-(35–57). Both of them had weak binding, with the latter showing no quantifiable binding. Table 1 lists the binding constants of the mutant peptides tested for binding to PC4CTD. Although mutation of single hydrophobic residues to alanine had a minor effect on the binding constant (KD 14–16 μm) (data not shown), there was a larger change upon multiple mutations (KD 45 μm) indicating the additive nature of hydrophobic residues in forming a stable complex. p53TAD is intrinsically unstructured in its free state (33Wells M. Tidow H. Rutherford T.J. Markwick P. Jensen M.R. Mylonas E. Svergun D.I. Blackledge M. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5762-5767Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and hence mutations introduced had no effect on its secondary structure as evidenced by circular dichroism measurements (data not shown).TABLE 1Dissociation constants obtained for the p53TAD peptides with PC4CTDPeptidesKdμmp53N-(10–57)-wild type8.2 ± 2hp53N-(10–57)-heptaphosphorylated3 ± 1hDp53N-(10–57)-aspartic acid mimic5 ± 1P53N-(35–57)-wild type12 ± 2Q52L p53N-(35–57)16 ± 1D49K/E51K p53N-(35–57)22 ± 3QS2 W53Q/F54S p53N-(35–57)20 ± 3I50A/W53A/F54A p53N-(35–57)42.5 ± 2L43A/L45A/I50A/W53A/F54A p53N-(35–57)45 ± 3D41K/D42K/D48K/D49K/E51K p53N-(35–57)Not quantifiable Open table in a new tab We also investigated the role of residues Phe-77, Lys-78, and Arg-86 of PC4 that are likely involved in interactions with TAD. We constructed a quadruple mutant (F77A/K78G/K80G/R86A), in which Phe-77 and Arg-86 were replaced with Ala and Lys-78 and Lys-80 were mutated to Gly. The fluorescence anisotropy experiments showed that the quadruple mutant does not bind TAD. In addition, no binding to ssDNA was observed, which is in agreement with earlier work where F77A/K78G/K80G mutations of PC4 abolished DNA binding (31Werten S. Stelzer G. Goppelt A. Langen F.M. Gros P. Timmers H.T. van der Vliet P.C. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5103-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We investigated the interaction between tumor suppressor p53 and positive cofactor 4 and showed that TAD2 of p53 mediates interaction with the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of PC4. We found that binding of TAD2 and ssDNA to PC4 were mutually exclusive, suggesting that p53 and ssDNA share a common binding site. Modeling of the p53N-PC4 complex revealed a wide range of stabilizing interactions such as hydrophobic, cation-π, and salt bridges. The binding of the p53 peptide to PC4 in the docking model revealed similarity to the ssDNA binding to PC4. Our docking model was validated with the experimental results of mutational analysis. Interestingly, the p53TAD2 binds PC4 in a similar orientation as VP16ad in the VP16-PC4 model complex (Fig. 9A) (16Jonker H.R. Wechselberger R.W. Boelens R. Folkers G.E. Kaptein R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of the activation domains of p53 and VP16 shows considerable degree of similarity (Fig. 9B). Residues of p53 that contribute to the interaction with PC4 are nearly invariant in VP16 and occupy similar spatial positions in both p53/PC4 and VP16/PC4 models. Tumor suppressor p53 regulates the transcription of numerous response elements, which, in turn, modulates the cell cycle or apoptotic pathways during genotoxic stress (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5707) Google Scholar). PC4 facilitates activator-dependent transcription by RNA polymerase II through mediating interactions with the basal transcriptional machinery (12Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). PC4 can stimulate the sequence-specific DNA binding of p53 and the C-terminal deletion mutant p53Δ30 (10Banerjee S. Kumar B.R. Kundu T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2052-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). PC4 also stimulates the recruitment of p53 and p53Δ30 to p53-response elements such as Bax and p21 in vivo through its interaction with p53 and enhances the apoptosis (11Batta K. Kundu T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7603-7614Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Using GST pulldown experiments, Banerjee et al. (10Banerjee S. Kumar B.R. Kundu T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2052-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) showed that the C terminus of p53 interacts with PC4, which does not clearly explain the observed in vivo results (in the case of p53Δ30). But a false-positive rate of 61% and false-negative rate of 38% are reported for the GST pulldown approach (34Comuzzi B. Sadar M.D. Cellscience. 2006; 3: 61-81PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, NMR is the gold standard for looking at weak and strong protein-protein interactions in solution at the atomic level (35Bonvin A.M. Boelens R. Kaptein R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2005; 9: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 36Zuiderweg E.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). However, the in vivo observations reported are reliable and are important and relevant for our present findings. Hence, based on our results and the published results of Banerjee et al. (10Banerjee S. Kumar B.R. Kundu T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2052-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we speculate a possible mechanism in which PC4 can recruit p53 to the response element site by interacting with its TAD. Once the site is reached, PC4 releases p53TAD and binds to DNA. PC4 is a DNA-bending protein and as such it probably provides a bent DNA conformation of the p53 cognate site and thereby enhances the ability of p53 to bind specifically to DNA. Under normal conditions, p53 levels in the cell are low, but upon stress, the levels of p53 rise, and cofactors like PC4, which are highly abundant, may enhance the p53-induced transcription by facilitating the transcriptional complex formation, and this would in turn lead to the increased level of p53-responsive target elements. Alternatively, p53 can exert an antagonizing role in inhibiting PC4-mediated repression. PC4 is shown to repress transcription by binding to melted DNA, and this effect is alleviated in the presence of TFIIH (31Werten S. Stelzer G. Goppelt A. Langen F.M. Gros P. Timmers H.T. van der Vliet P.C. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5103-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Hence, the functional role of PC4-p53 interaction may be context-dependent and needs further investigation. Acidic activators have been proposed to interact with target proteins through electrostatic interactions by their intrinsically unstructured regions (37Hermann S. Berndt K.D. Wright A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40127-40132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Secondary structure formation upon target binding is observed in these activation domains (38Ferreira M.E. Hermann S. Prochasson P. Workman J.L. Berndt K.D. Wright A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21779-21784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The isolated TAD is intrinsically disordered, a property that is common in many other activation domains (33Wells M. Tidow H. Rutherford T.J. Markwick P. Jensen M.R. Mylonas E. Svergun D.I. Blackledge M. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5762-5767Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). An α-helix is induced in the TAD upon binding to various target proteins like MDM2, TAZ2, RPA, and PC4 (22Bochkareva E. Kaustov L. Ayed A. Yi G.S. Lu Y. Pineda-Lucena A. Liao J.C. Okorokov A.L. Milner J. Arrowsmith C.H. Bochkarev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15412-15417Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 39Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). Similar secondary structure formation is observed in the VP16-bound complex (16Jonker H.R. Wechselberger R.W. Boelens R. Folkers G.E. Kaptein R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 40Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Initially, it was suggested that acidic domains mediate interactions with the target proteins through ionic interactions (41Ptashne M. Gann A.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 329-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). However, further studies showed that hydrophobic amino acids are critical for protein-protein interactions between activators and general transcriptional machinery. Mutations of these residues have a deleterious effect on transcriptional activation (42Sainz M.B. Goff S.A. Chandler V.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 43Regier J.L. Shen F. Triezenberg S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 44Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Science. 1991; 251: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, a target-induced folding model has been proposed, where the electrostatic interactions determine the kinetic stability of the complex formation, whereas the hydrophobic interactions establish the thermodynamic binding affinity of the interaction (37Hermann S. Berndt K.D. Wright A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40127-40132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 38Ferreira M.E. Hermann S. Prochasson P. Workman J.L. Berndt K.D. Wright A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21779-21784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our mutational analyses suggest that the p53TAD2-PC4 interaction is a composite of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. They probably work synergistically in target protein recognition and binding. The hydrophobic interactions may play an important role in determining the stability of complex formation, whereas electrostatic interactions facilitate the formation of complex. Phosphorylation increases the net negative charge, which can explain its positive effect on the p53/PC4 binding. The molecular basis of protein mimics of DNA has been extensively reviewed over the past years (45Dryden D.T. Tock M.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The effective DNA mimic usually represents a surface that is complementary in shape and similar in chemical composition (charge) to DNA. Although most of the cases described in the literature concern protein mimics of double-stranded DNA, only few examples of single-stranded DNA mimicry are known. Among those is the crystal structure of the p53TAD-RPA complex that provides direct evidence for ssDNA mimicry by the p53 transactivation domain (22Bochkareva E. Kaustov L. Ayed A. Yi G.S. Lu Y. Pineda-Lucena A. Liao J.C. Okorokov A.L. Milner J. Arrowsmith C.H. Bochkarev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15412-15417Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that p53TAD interacts with mitochondrial ssDNA (mtSSB)-binding protein, and this interaction enhances the 3′–5′-exonuclease activity of p53 and DNA repair in mitochondria during oxidative stress. We also demonstrated that the p53TAD binds to the DNA binding surface of mtSSB and perturbs the interaction with ssDNA (26Wong T.S. Rajagopalan S. Townsley F.M. Freund S.M. Petrovich M. Loakes D. Fersht A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 568-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this study we showed that p53TAD binds to PC4 and its binding site resides in the DNA-binding interface. Taken together, the p53TAD competes with ssDNA for binding to three structurally distinct DNA-binding domains (PC4, mtSSB, and RPA). Although RPA and mtSSB share a common OB fold, PC4CTD forms an intertwined dimer with a globally different structure. The only common feature between these protein domains is the DNA-binding interface, which in all cases is a Β-sheet with a characteristic curvature. Despite the structural differences between these p53TAD interaction partners, the p53 peptide binds to them in a very similar way. In both p53TAD/RPA structure and our p53TAD/PC4 model, p53TAD2 is positioned along the concave Β-sheet interface with the hydrophobic residues pointing toward the interface and acidic residues to the surface (Fig. 7). Thus the shape and charge of the binding interface rather than the fold of the target protein determine the selective p53TAD2 binding. p53TAD2 could potentially interact with other structurally distinct DNA-binding domains that share these features. DNA mimicry could be a general functional feature of this region of p53. p53 contains a DNA-binding domain that binds to double-stranded DNA (46Kitayner M. Rozenberg H. Kessler N. Rabinovich D. Shaulov L. Haran T.E. Shakked Z. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 741-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Because the p53 DNA-binding interface is very different from that of PC4, mtSSB, and RPA, we tested whether p53TAD binds to this interface. Our experiments indicated that the p53TAD binds with a weak affinity of >100 μm to the core domain (data not shown). Competition experiments revealed that p53TAD did bind to the DNA-binding surface of p53. But the interaction is completely electrostatic because at higher ionic strengths no binding was observed. The DNA mimicry role of p53TAD can play an important role in the transcriptional machinery. PC4 was identified as a DNA-binding protein that enhances the activator-dependent transcription of class II genes in vitro by stimulating diverse activators like VP16, thyroid hormone receptor, octamer transcription factor 1, and BRCA-1 by facilitating assembly of the preinitiation complex between the activators and the general transcriptional machinery (12Ge H.

PC4 may be involved in the recruitment of active phosphorylated p53 to the basal transcriptional machinery through its association with the transactivation domain of p53. Apart from the regulation of basal transcription function and DNA repair, other functional DNA mimicry roles of p53TAD need to be investigated. Moreover, many acidic activation domains may share similar tendencies in modulating their functions at the cellular level through the DNA mimicry role. We thank Drs. C. M. Johnson, T. S. Wong, and A.

It is also well established that ligand stimulation of many plasma membrane receptors leads to their internalization. However, stimulus-induced regulation of endosomal trafficking has not received much attention. In previous studies, we showed that sustained stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC) with phorbol esters led to sequestration of recycling endosomes in a juxtanuclear region. In this study, we investigated whether G-protein-coupled receptors that activate PKC exerted effects on endosomal trafficking. Stimulation of cells with serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) led to sequestration of the 5-HT receptor (5-HT2AR) into a Rab11-positive juxtanuclear compartment. This sequestration coincided with translocation of PKC as shown by confocal microscopy. Mechanistically the observed sequestration of 5-HT2AR was shown to require continuous PKC activity because it was inhibited by pretreatment with classical PKC inhibitor Gö6976 and could be reversed by posttreatment with this inhibitor. In addition, classical PKC autophosphorylation was necessary for receptor sequestration. Moreover inhibition of phospholipase D (PLD) activity and inhibition of PLD1 and PLD2 using dominant negative constructs also prevented this process. Functionally this sequestration did not affect receptor desensitization or resensitization as measured by intracellular calcium increase. However, the PKC- and PLD-dependent sequestration of receptors resulted in co-sequestration of other plasma membrane proteins and receptors as shown for epidermal growth factor receptor and protease activated receptor-1. This led to heterologous desensitization of those receptors and diverted their cellular fate by protecting them from agonist-induced degradation. Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel role for sustained receptor stimulation in regulation of intracellular trafficking, and this process requires sustained stimulation of PKC and PLD.

Ceramide inhibits autophosphorylation of cPKC, which was also found to be required for this novel translocation (11Kitatani K. Idkowiak-Baldys J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly sustained activation of cPKC also resulted in significant effects on recycling components and their sequestration to the same region, dubbed the pericentrion (defined as the cPKC-dependent subset of recycling endosomes). On the other hand, components and markers of the endolysosomal compartment were not sequestered to the pericentrion upon PKC stimulation (7Idkowiak-Baldys J. Becker K.P. Kitatani K. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22321-22331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Functionally it was also shown that pericentrion formation and sequestration of PKC requires clathrin-dependent endocytosis.

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of integral membrane receptors. They contain seven transmembrane domains (12Yeagle P.L. Albert A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 808-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), are coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins, and are activated by a vast number of ligands. They regulate many cellular processes and serve as targets for at least half of the therapeutics currently present on the market. Upon agonist binding, conformational changes in the receptor lead to coupling with G-proteins (composed of α, β, and γ subunits). This leads to dissociation of α and β/γ subunits that mediate downstream signaling (13Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Interestingly PKC serves as one of the downstream targets of GPCRs. Thus, it became critical to determine whether persistent stimulation of receptors that couple to cPKC exerts effects on recycling endosomes. We focused on the serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) and the angiotensin II receptor (AT1AR) as two GPCRs that couple to Gq, which in turn activates phospholipase Cβ and then PKC (14Wang C. Jayadev S. Escobedo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16677-16682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Conn P.J. Sanders-Bush E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1985; 234: 195-203PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we show that sustained stimulation of those receptors led to their sequestration in a PKC- and PLD-dependent manner. Most importantly, this led to global sequestration of endosomes with profound effects on other membrane receptors. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) are known to be targeted into a degradative pathway upon their agonist treatment (16Sorkin A. Goh L.K. Exp.

Interestingly 5-HT induced co-sequestration of those receptors with 5-HT2AR and protected them from degradation upon their own agonist treatment.

Cells were plated onto 35-mm confocal dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) at a density of 5 × 105 cells/dish and grown for 24 h. Transient transfections of DNA (0.5–1 μg/dish) were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer舗s recommendations. Transfected cells were grown for 24 h in 10% fetal bovine serum-containing medium. Transfection efficiencies of 40–60% were obtained in these experiments. Cells expressing GFP or YFP fusions alone were viewed after fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde (10 min) followed by cold methanol (5 min). For indirect immunofluorescence, following fixation cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS and blocked with 2% human serum, PBS for 1 h at room temperature. All incubations with primary antibodies were performed in 2% human serum, PBS overnight at 4 °C. All confocal images were taken with a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510 Meta, Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Each microscopic image is representative of 10–20 fields over a minimum of three experiments, and all images were taken at the equatorial plane of the cell. Raw data images were cropped in Adobe Photoshop CS2® for publication. Protein samples were boiled for 10 min in reducing SDS sample buffer and separated by 4–20% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dried milk; washed with PBS-Tween; and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal antibody for phospho-PKCα/βII (1:1000), mouse monoclonal antibody for PKCα (1:2000), sheep polyclonal antibody for EGFR (1:2000), or rabbit polyclonal antibody for GFP (1:1000) in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 containing either 5% nonfat dried milk or 5% bovine serum albumin. The blots were washed with PBS-Tween and incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase in PBS-Tween containing 5% nonfat dried milk. Detection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). Intracellular calcium release was measured by a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR) (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). HEK293 cells were transfected and 24 h after transfection subcultured into 96-well flat bottom plates coated with poly-d-lysine (Greiner BioOne). After treatment, cells were loaded with the intracellular fluorescent calcium probe Fluo-3 (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 540 nm; Molecular Probes) in a loading buffer (Hanks舗 balanced salt solution, 20 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm probenecid) for 1 h at 37 °C with or without pretreatments. After washing twice with loading buffer, cells were placed onto the FLIPR and exposed to agonists for 5 min. Increases in intracellular calcium were reflected by increases in detected fluorescence. After starvation, HEK293 cells overexpressing 5-HT2AR-YFP were washed once with ice-cold PBS for 5 min. Next cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml (in PBS) sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) for 30 min on ice. After incubation, excess biotin was quenched by washing with ice-cold 15 mm glycine. Next cells were washed with prewarmed minimal essential medium, 0.1% bovine serum albumin containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C before treatment. All treatment conditions were done in duplicate. To measure total biotin associated with the cells, one set of samples was harvested immediately after treatment. To measure the internalized biotin, the second set of samples was stripped from cell surface biotin by washing three times for 5min with ice-cold GSH cleavage buffer (50 mm GSH, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.75% 10 n NaOH). Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with streptavidin-agarose (Novagen, San Diego, CA) and analyzed by Western blot to detect 5-HT2AR-YFP. The amount of internalized receptor was determined as a percentage of total cell-associated biotin. Statistical significance was determined using one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-test (GraphPad Prism, version 4). p values lower than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. The agonist-induced internalization of the 5-HT2AR has been reported recently (20Bhattacharyya S. Puri S. Miledi R. Panicker M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 14470-14475Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); however, the detailed trafficking of 5-HT2AR following continuous exposure to its natural ligand, 5-HT, has not yet been elucidated. To study the effects of 5-HT more closely, confocal microscopy studies were performed in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with 5-HT2AR-YFP. Immediately after agonist treatment (1 min), 5-HT2AR underwent endocytosis; however, continuous treatment with agonist (30 min to 2 h) induced redistribution of internalized 5-HT2AR and its sequestration in a perinuclear compartment (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). Similar sequestration was observed for the AT1AR upon sustained ligand action (Fig. 1B). To study cellular localization of sequestered receptors, colocalization with markers of different compartments was performed. The sequestered 5-HT2AR colocalized with, but extended beyond, Rab11 (Fig. 1C), a marker of the perinuclear recycling compartment. There was no colocalization with Lamp1 (lysosomal marker) or giantin (Golgi marker). Brefeldin A, which disrupts the Golgi, did not inhibit 5-HT2AR sequestration (Fig. 1C). Taken together, sustained stimulation of receptors leads to their sequestration into a perinuclear recycling compartment. A previous study implicated PKC in agonist-induced 5-HT2AR internalization (20Bhattacharyya S. Puri S. Miledi R. Panicker M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 14470-14475Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and our work has established a critical role for cPKC in the sequestration of recycling molecules into a subset of endosomes in the perinuclear region (6Becker K.P. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52747-52754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Idkowiak-Baldys J. Becker K.P. Kitatani K. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22321-22331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, it was demonstrated previously that sustained activation of cPKC by PMA not only caused sequestration of recycling components but also led to a concomitant translocation of cPKCα and -βII but not -βI into the pericentrion (8Becker K.P. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28251-28256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to investigate whether the observed 5-HT-induced sequestration of receptors involves cPKC. In control cells, the 5-HT2AR was predominantly present on the cell surface, whereas cPKC localized in the cytosol. 5-HT induced rapid internalization of 5-HT2AR and a translocation of cPKC to the plasma membrane. More prolonged agonist treatment brought about the sequestration of the 5-HT2AR but also caused some co-sequestration of PKCβII (Fig. 2A). Similar observations were made in C6 glioma cells that harbor endogenous 5-HT2AR: when C6 cells were transfected with GFP-PKCβII and treated with 5-HT for 2 h, sequestration of cPKC to the pericentrion was also observed (Fig. 2B). When cells were co-transfected with GFP-tagged Rab11 and PKCβII-mCherry, colocalization of PKC with Rab11 compartment was observed (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Next the role of cPKC in the agonist-induced 5-HT2AR sequestration was evaluated. Pretreatment of cells with the cPKC inhibitor Gö6976 prevented sequestration of 5-HT2A receptors (Fig. 3A, PRE). It should be noted that following treatment with Gö6976 5-HT2A receptors were detected in vesicular structures close to the plasma membrane that colocalized with the early endosomal marker EEA1 (Fig. 3A). In addition, to quantitate the amount of internalized receptor, a cleavable biotin recycling assay was performed. It was observed that after 2 h of 5-HT treatment, a significant amount of the receptor was internalized. Pretreatment of cells with Gö6976 only moderately decreased the amount of internalized receptor (Fig. 3B). Thus, cPKC appears to be required for sequestration of receptors and partially involved in internalization but not absolutely required for the latter. To determine whether activation of PKC is sufficient to induce sequestration of 5-HT2AR, cells were treated with the phorbol ester PMA. This treatment caused a robust translocation of both PKCβII and 5-HT2AR receptors to the pericentrion (Fig. 3C). Thus, activation of PKC is necessary and sufficient to induce the sequestration of GPCRs. Next the effects of persistent ligand action on cPKC activity were determined by evaluating the phosphorylation of PKCα/βII on Thr-638/641. The results demonstrated that treatment of C6 and HEK293 cells with agonist caused an increase in the phosphorylation of Thr-638/641 that persisted for up to 2 h of treatment (Fig. 3D), thus demonstrating sustained activation of cPKC. Importantly treatment of cells with the cPKC inhibitor following ligand-induced sequestration (Fig. 3A, POST) also caused dispersal of the sequestered 5-HT2A receptors. Thus, sustained activity of cPKC is required for maintaining sequestration of receptors. To further elucidate the role of cPKC phosphorylation in 5-HT2AR sequestration, PKCβII autophosphorylation sites (Thr-641 and Ser-660) were mutated to alanine, thus generating a double alanine (DA) mutant of PKCβII. 5-HT stimulation of cells co-transfected with 5-HT2AR and WT PKCβII caused perinuclear sequestration of both 5-HT2AR and PKC (Fig. 3E). However, when cells were co-transfected with the 5-HT2A receptor and the DA mutant of PKCβII, neither PKC nor the receptor was sequestered to the perinuclear region, although the DA mutant did translocate to the plasma membrane. When DA-PKCβII was expressed alone it showed a cytoplasmic distribution, typically observed for PKC in unstimulated cells (Fig. 3E, bottom panel). However, when coexpressed together with 5-HT2AR, there was a considerable amount of the DA-PKCβII localized to the membrane without agonist stimulation. It was previously shown that PKCβII mutated at S660A,T641A and mutated at both autophosphorylation sites (DA) does not dissociate efficiently from the membrane after activation (19Feng X. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26870-26874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because 5-HT2AR-YFP has a small amount of constitutive activity even in the absence of agonist, the results suggest that DA-PKCβII is activated in cells coexpressing 5-HT2AR. In accordance with that, the 5-HT2AR antagonist ketanserin completely prevented this basal localization of DA-PKCβII to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3E, lower panel) It should be noted that although the DA mutant completely blocked 5-HT-induced 5-HT2AR sequestration, a fraction of receptors was internalized and localized to the early endosomes (data not shown). Taken together, these results imply an important role for cPKC in the regulation of 5-HT2AR sequestration into the pericentrion. It was shown previously that PLD activation was required for translocation of PKCα/βII and formation of the pericentrion (8Becker K.P. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28251-28256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To further define the mechanism of receptor sequestration, it became important to determine whether the PLD pathway was involved in agonist-induced 5-HT2AR sequestration. Inhibition of PLD with 1-butanol abolished the perinuclear sequestration of receptors; however, treatment with 2-butanol, a positional isomer of 1-butanol that does not inhibit PLD, was without effect (Fig. 4A). Although 1-butanol prevented 5-HT2AR sequestration, a significant portion of the receptor became located in the EEA1-positive early endosomes (Fig. 4A). To further corroborate a role for PLD and to determine which PLD isoform is involved in receptor sequestration, cells were co-transfected with 5-HT2AR-YFP and wild type or dominant negative (KR) PLD1 or PLD2. Interestingly dominant negative versions of both isoforms inhibited sequestration of receptors, and receptors were present on the cell surface and in dispersed endosomes (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results suggest that activity of both PLD isoforms is required for 5HT-induced 5-HT2AR sequestration into the pericentrion. Because the above results implicate cPKC and PLD in sequestration of receptors, it became important to investigate whether sequestration played any role in receptor desensitization or resensitization. To study 5-HT2AR responsiveness to 5-HT, a FLIPR assay that measures changes in the concentration of cytoplasmic calcium was used. Interestingly the rates of 5-HT2AR desensitization or resensitization were not affected by overexpression of autophosphorylation-deficient (DA) or inactive (KR) forms of PKCβII (Fig. 5), implying that 5-HT2AR sequestration has no effect on receptor desensitization or resensitization as measured by changes in the concentration of cytoplasmic calcium. Because sustained stimulation with 5-HT resulted in sequestration of both receptors and cPKC to the perinuclear region, it became critical to determine whether agonist treatment caused sequestration of other recycling molecules (e.g. CD59 and transferrin). Stimulation of cells with 5-HT induced significant co-sequestration of both receptors and CD59, a complement regulatory protein, as well as fluorescent transferrin into the perinuclear region (Fig. 6, A and B). Thus, sustained stimulation of receptors leads to sequestration of recycling molecules. Treatment with cPKC and PLD inhibitors efficiently blocked sequestration of both CD59 and transferrin in response to 5HT, suggesting that agonist-induced cPKC/PLD-dependent 5-HT2AR sequestration globally affects the intracellular trafficking of recycling membrane components. The significance of 5-HT-induced formation of the pericentrion in regulation of trafficking and signaling of other membrane receptors was evaluated next, and for these studies, the effects of 5-HT on the endogenous EGFR were examined because PMA has been shown to regulate the trafficking of EGFR. Treatment with 5-HT led to the simultaneous sequestration of both 5-HT2AR and the EGFR in the perinuclear region (Fig. 7A). Moreover this translocation occurred in a cPKC- and PLD-dependent manner because it was inhibited by both Gö6976 and 1-butanol (Fig. 7A). Interestingly it has been shown previously that activation of PKC with PMA diverts internalized EGFR from a degradative to a recycling pathway(s) (21Bao J. Alroy I. Waterman H. Schejter E.D. Brodie C. Gruenberg J. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26178-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, we wondered whether the 5-HT2AR displayed the capacity to regulate the fate of the EGFR. When cells were treated with epidermal growth factor, there was significant loss of the EGFR protein; however, pretreatment with either PMA or 5-HT prevented/ameliorated the loss of the EGFR (Fig. 7B). Importantly the protective effects of PMA and 5-HT were inhibited by 1-butanol (Fig. 7B), whereas the secondary alcohol (2-butanol) did not have any effect (data not shown). PAR-1 provides an example of a GPCR that is rapidly internalized and degraded following its activation (17Trejo J. Hammes S.R. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13698-13702Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 18Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and thus, it was chosen for additional study. First we confirmed that treatment with the PAR-1 agonist peptide (SFLLRN) led to significant degradation of PAR-1, whereas PMA caused sequestration of PAR-1 as analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 8A). Most interestingly, however, treatment of cells with 5-HT led to co-sequestration of both receptors in a cPKC- and PLD-dependent manner, and when cells were pretreated with 5-HT, SFLLRN did not induce degradation (Fig. 8B). Taken together, these results indicate that sustained stimulation with 5-HT changes the cellular fate of membrane receptors that are normally targeted for degradation. The results from this study reveal dramatic effects of sustained stimulation of cPKC by GPCRs on the trafficking of several proteins leading to their sequestration in the perinuclear region. It is shown that sustained stimulation of Gq-coupled GPCRs leads to their sequestration into a subset of the Rab11-positive recycling compartment. This sequestration was cPKC-dependent and required continuous cPKC activation and PLD activity. Importantly receptor stimulation and sequestration globally affected cellular trafficking by sequestration of recycling endosomes and changed the cellular fate of EGFR and PAR-1 by diverting their trafficking and thus protecting them from degradation (Fig. 9). Many studies have implicated PKC in the internalization of specific receptors, transporters, and channels (22Kermorgant S. Parker P.J. J.

Some of these studies have focused on direct phosphorylation of these molecules by PKC. Although the current studies do not rule out a role for direct phosphorylation by PKC in mediating specific effects, the results point to a more global cPKC-dependent process by which sustained activation of cPKC regulates endosomal trafficking. Sustained agonist treatment led to activation of cPKC and resulted in receptor and cPKC sequestration in a PKC-dependent subset of the Rab11 compartment, the pericentrion. This sequestration was dependent on continuous cPKC activity. Pretreatment with cPKC inhibitor prevented receptors sequestration, whereas posttreatment led to dispersal of sequestered receptors. It needs to be emphasized that internalization of receptors was not completely blocked because some receptors were still observed in early endosomes. Similarly internalization of the biotinylated receptor was only partially inhibited when cells were pretreated with cPKC inhibitor. The observed process also requires PLD as a further downstream target of cPKC activation, suggesting that either phosphatidic acid (the product of the PLD reaction) or subsequent lipid metabolites are required for this novel endosomal trafficking. It was shown previously that PLD2 was required for endocytosis of angiotensin receptor (33Du G. Huang P. Liang B.T. Frohman M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1024-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Activity of PLD2 was also shown to be important for endocytosis, desensitization, and resensitization of μ-opioid receptor, and it was shown to directly interact with this receptor (34Koch T. Brandenburg L.O. Liang Y. Schulz S. Beyer A. Schröder H. Höllt V. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 680-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 35Koch T. Wu D.F. Yang L.Q. Brandenburg L.O. Höllt V. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is shown here that both PLD1 and PLD2 were involved in sequestration of 5-HT2AR. Because PLD1 and PLD2 have different cellular localization (33Du G. Huang P. Liang B.T. Frohman M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1024-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) it is possible that they control different steps of the observed sequestration. PLD2 localized mainly on the cell surface (33Du G. Huang P. Liang B.T. Frohman M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1024-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), whereas PLD1 was shown to be present in recycling endosomes and to colocalize with sequestered PKC (9Hu T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35702-35708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It can be speculated that PLD2 is responsible for the initial step, whereas PLD1 is responsible for the distal steps of sequestration, but this idea has to be investigated further. It cannot be excluded that there is a direct interaction between one or both isoforms of PLD and receptors during the sequestration. Indeed colocalization of 5-HT2A receptor with PLD2 was observed in control cells, whereas colocalization with PLD1 was observed upon receptor sequestration. To control GPCR signaling initiated by agonist, receptors undergo desensitization, a key process that prevents pathologies that would result from sustained receptor signaling. This can occur through several mechanisms (36Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-353PubMed Google Scholar). It can be accomplished through phosphorylation of GPCRs by GPCR kinases (37Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar) that leads to binding of another group of proteins, arrestins (38Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). This uncouples GPCRs from G-proteins and facilitates receptor internalization. Receptor trafficking is also important for regulation of their activity (39Hanyaloglu A.C. von Zastrow M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2008; 48: 537-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Internalization of 5-HT2AR was shown to be important in receptor desensitization (40Hanley N.R. Hensler J.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 41Gray J.A. Sheffler D.J. Bhatnagar A. Woods J.A. Hufeisen S.J. Benovic J.L. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1020-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) in some cell types. Published studies suggest that the role of PKC in 5-HT2AR desensitization seems to be variable depending on the cell type (40Hanley N.R. Hensler J.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 42Kagaya A. Mikuni M. Kusumi I. Yamamoto H. Takahashi K. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Auberger P. Pouysségur J. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4813-4821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In our hands sequestration did not exert significant effects on receptor desensitization or resensitization possibly due to the fact that receptor internalization was not completely inhibited. Although sequestration of receptors does not appear to be important for desensitization or resensitization as measured by intracellular calcium increase, it cannot be excluded that other receptor functions are modulated by this process. Because those functions can be unique for specific receptors they have to be studied carefully in appropriate model systems. It was observed that sustained receptor stimulation led to not only sequestration of receptors but also to sequestration of other molecules from the cell surface. Functionally this may exert significant effects on the availability of recycling proteins at the plasma membrane and their specific functions. Interestingly it was shown previously that 5-HT inhibits voltage-gated potassium currents via internalization of Kv1.5 (30Cogolludo A. Moreno L. Lodi F. Frazziano G. Cobeño L. Tamargo J. Perez-Vizcaino F. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Current studies implicate a role of 5-HT in changing the cellular fate of EGFR and PAR-1. It was shown previously that activation of PKC with PMA leads to internalization of EGFR without its degradation (21Bao J. Alroy I. Waterman H. Schejter E.D. Brodie C. Gruenberg J. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26178-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 46Beguinot L. Hanover J.A. Ito S. Richert N.D. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 2774-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Here it was shown that sustained stimulation of GPCRs with agonist leads to a similar effect, which is of importance because defects in trafficking of EGFR have been implicated in cell transformation and oncogenesis (47Ceresa B.P. Schmid S.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Similarly we showed that sustained 5-HT treatment protected PAR-1 from agonist-induced degradation. This is consistent with previously made observations that PMA leads to heterologous desensitization of PAR-1 (48Yan W. Tiruppathi C. Lum H. Qiao R. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C387-C395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, the results from this study demonstrate that sustained stimulation of cPKC by GPCRs leads to cPKC- and PLD-dependent sequestration of receptors with general effects on trafficking (Fig. 9). Agonist-induced sequestration of recycling components may have profound effects on their function and could explain pathologies resulting from sustained receptor activation.

https://openalex.org/W2010755412,"Hexokinase 2 (Hxk2) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was one of the first metabolic enzymes described as a multifunctional protein. Hxk2 has a double subcellular localization; it functions as a glycolytic enzyme in the cytoplasm and as a regulator of gene transcription of several Mig1-regulated genes in the nucleus. However, the mechanism by which Hxk2 enters and leaves the nucleus is still unknown. In low glucose conditions, Hxk2 is phosphorylated at serine 14, but how this phosphorylation may affect glucose signaling is also unknown at the moment. Here we report that the Hxk2 protein is an export substrate of the carrier protein Xpo1 (Crm1). We also show that the Hxk2 nuclear export and the binding of Hxk2 and Xpo1 involve two leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NES) located between leucine 23 and isoleucine 33 (NES1) and between leucine 310 and leucine 318 (NES2). We also show that the Hxk2 phosphorylation at serine 14 promotes Hxk2 export by facilitating the association of Hxk2 with Xpo1. Our study uncovers a new cargo for the Xpo1 yeast exportin and identifies Hxk2 phosphorylation at serine 14 as a regulatory mechanism that controls its nuclear exit in function of the glucose levels."
https://openalex.org/W1993543264,"Mutations of the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) are responsible for sporadic and familial colorectal tumors. APC negatively regulates Wnt signaling by inducing beta-catenin degradation. It has also been shown that APC plays a role in the organization of cytoskeletal networks. APC interacts with Asef and Asef2, Rac1- and Cdc42-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), and stimulates their GEF activity; thereby regulating cell morphology, adhesion, and migration. Truncated mutant APCs present in colorectal tumor cells activate Asef and Asef2 constitutively and contribute to their aberrant migratory properties. We show here that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), as well as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), induce the accumulation and colocalization of APC and Asef in membrane ruffles and lamellipodia of epithelial cells. Both APC and Asef were found to be required for HGF-induced cell migration. Furthermore, we show that the effects of HGF, bFGF, and EGF on APC and Asef are mediated by the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and require the PH domain of Asef. These results suggest that Asef and APC function downstream of HGF and PI3-kinase, and play critical roles in growth factor-mediated regulation of cell morphology and migration."
https://openalex.org/W2044444650,"Background The integration of multiple complementary approaches is a powerful way to understand the processes of diversification and speciation. The parasitoid wasp Aphidius transcaspicus Telenga (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a parasitoid of Hyalopterus aphids across a wide geographic range. This species shows a remarkable degree of genetic structure among western, central, and eastern Mediterranean population clusters. In this paper we attempt to better characterize this genetic structure. Methodology/Principal Findings We use a Bayesian coalescent analysis of gene flow under the Isolation with Migration model using mitochondrial and microsatellite markers together with climate-based ecological niche models to better understand the genetic structure of A. transcaspicus in the Mediterranean. The coalescent analysis revealed low levels of migration among western and eastern Mediterranean populations (Nm<1) that were not statistically distinguishable from zero. Niche models showed that localities within population clusters each occupy areas of continuously high environmental suitability, but are separated from each other by large regions of completely unsuitable habitat that could limit dispersal. Overall, environmental characteristics were similar among the population clusters, though significant differences did emerge. Conclusions/Significance These results support contemporary allopatric isolation of Mediterranean populations of A. transcaspicus, which together with previous analyses indicating partial behaviorally mediated reproductive isolation, suggest that the early stages of cryptic speciation may be in progress."
https://openalex.org/W1989923722,"The neuroinvasive pathogen Neisseria meningitidis has 13 capsular serogroups, but the majority of disease is caused by only 5 of these. Groups B, C, Y, and W-135 all display a polymeric sialic acid-containing capsule that provides a means for the bacteria to evade the immune response during infection by mimicking host sialic acid-containing cell surface structures. These capsules in serogroups C, Y, and W-135 can be further acetylated by a sialic acid-specific O-acetyltransferase, a modification that correlates with decreased immunoreactivity and increased virulence. In N. meningitidis serogroup Y, the O-acetylation reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme OatWY, which we show has clear specificity toward the serogroup Y capsule ([Glc-(alpha1-->4)-Sia](n)). To understand the underlying molecular basis of this process, we have performed crystallographic analysis of OatWY with bound substrate as well as determined kinetic parameters of the wild type enzyme and active site mutants. The structure of OatWY reveals an intimate homotrimer of left-handed beta-helix motifs that frame a deep active site cleft selective for the polysialic acid-bearing substrate. Within the active site, our structural, kinetic, and mutagenesis data support the role of two conserved residues in the catalytic mechanism (His-121 and Trp-145) and further highlight a significant movement of Tyr-171 that blocks the active site of the enzyme in its native form. Collectively, our results reveal the first structural features of a bacterial sialic acid O-acetyltransferase and provide significant new insight into its catalytic mechanism and specificity for the capsular polysaccharide of serogroup Y meningococci."

This paper presents a heuristic algorithm for discovering the Most Likely Functional Counterparts (MoLFunCs) of a protein, based on simple concepts from network theory. A key feature of our algorithm is utilization of the user's knowledge to assign high confidence to selected functional identification. We show use of the algorithm to retrieve functional equivalents for 7 membrane proteins, from an exploration of almost 40 genomes form multiple online resources. We verify the functional equivalency of our dataset through a series of tests that include sequence, structure and function comparisons. Comparison is made to the OMA methodology, which also identifies one-on-one mapping between proteins from different species. Based on that comparison, we believe that incorporation of user's knowledge as a key aspect of the technique adds value to purely statistical formal methods."
