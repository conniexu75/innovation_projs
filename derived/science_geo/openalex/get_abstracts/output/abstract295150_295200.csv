https://openalex.org/W1984155520,A group of pigeons that had previously received noncontingent food delivery acquired the key-peck response (in autoshape training) more slowly than did a naive control group; key-peck acquisition was most rapid for a group given operant treadle-press training in the initial phase.

https://openalex.org/W2006411932,"After undergoing the processing for electron microscopy, bound uranyl ions are revealed as characteristic electron-opaque crystals. Meristematic walls and associated vesicles become heavily labeled, while pinocytotic accumulation into vacuoles seems probable in cap cells and those just behind the meristem. The endodermal Casparian strip and suberinized lamella are effective barriers to the passage of uranyl ions."
https://openalex.org/W2088003443,"Radar interferometry is a new technique for accurately measuring the topography of the lunar surface from the earth. Measurements have been made with this technique of an area including the craters Ptolemaeus, Alphonsus, and Arzachel and a portion of Mare Nubium. There is evidence for a late episode of volcanism that partially filled two of the craters through a crustal fault of Imbrian origin. Several other features of the topography, particularly those coinciding with local gravitational anomalies, can be correlated with flow events."
https://openalex.org/W1982364528,"The nation is entering a period when the R & D output must be increased, probably without major increases in resource allocation. Obviously, in this situation, either efficiency or productivity must be increased. Perhaps one of the most wasteful aspects of the national R & D system (and one that received little attention during the golden era of the 15 percent per year expansion) has been the very weak coupling between the university, on the one hand, and industry (or government), on the other. It is a serious error to allege about such coupling that ""it has never worked,"" that the objectives and reward structures of the institutions are such that it cannot work, and so on. The fact is that coupling has never been tried seriously. History shows that the total dollar effort in research that required coupling or that had coupling as its main objective was on the order of $10 million per year (that is, much less than 0.1 percent of the research money spent on U.S. campuses). At the same time, there is little doubt that the experiments which must and will be tried in the immediate future call for innovations in management and changes in the attitude and structure of many universities. In conversations with administrators who have had experience with such programs, I have found strong suggestions of very mixed responses from the universities. In light of these responses, and if effectiveness is a goal, it would be better for those universities that are more wedded to disciplinary research, to single principal-investigator work, not to participate in these new efforts. We need much greater diversity in the styles of university life, and it would be healthy for the academic enterprise if some universities retained a greater degree of detachment from society, while others consciously decided to interact more with it, through the private sector, and made the changes necessary to do so. If initial funding is restricted to those universities that consider university-industry or university-government research a worthy objective and that have a proven track record and a favorable administrative and reward structure, the new programs may well establish a major new pattern of national R & D."

Beggiatoa has now been isolated from rice field soil. A mutually favorable interaction between rice and this bacterium is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2034981116,"Previous methods used for two-dimensional radar mapping of the moon are contrasted with new techniques that add altitude information to the radar map. Delay-Doppler stereoscopy and delay-Doppler interferometry are shown to provide surface-height variations with higher accuracy and better global fidelity than has been possible previously. Sample results are presented for altitude contours on the moon as obtained with the Haystack and Westford radar systems of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. An appendix describes the mathematical principles of delay-Doppler interferometry in determining the position of an arbitrary reflecting region of the lunar surface from measurements of the time delay, Doppler shift, and fringe phase of radar echoes from that region."
