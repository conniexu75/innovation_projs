The respiratory quotient (RQ) was obtained by standard procedures (5). These studies show that the RQ of germinating cucumber seeds was increased by the naphthylalanines previously mentioned (Table 1), with the exception of ,B-2-naphthylalanine. The RQ of the 1-1-naphthylalanine, glycyl-13-1-naphthylalanines, and ,3-3-thianaphthylalanine treated seed can be correlated to the growth pattern observed in the roots. These compounds produced an effect similar to that observed with 1-naphthaleneacetic acid. The RQ of the seeds treated with the carbobenzoxyglycyl-O-naphthylalanines and 13-naphthylalanine was approximately the same as the control whereas the growth behavior was much less than that of the nontreated seeds. A possible explanation for these results is that the f-2-naphthylalanines may be converted into naphthyleneacetic acid by a mechanism similar to the conversion of tryptophane to indoleacetic acid in plants."

In the present investigation, the nature of the requirement for either aspartic acid or threonine for growth of L. dextranicum 8086 has been found to be the result of a competitive inhibition by glutamic acid of the utilization of aspartic acid in the biosynthesis of threonine."
