https://openalex.org/W2083822658,"We previously reported the cloning of a serine/threonine kinase, PAK (for p21 (Cdc42/Rac)-activated kinase), which binds to the Ras-related GTPases Cdc42Hs and Rac1 (Manser, E., Leung, T., Salihuddin, H., Zhao, Z-s., and Lim, L.(1994) Nature 367, 40-46). These p21 proteins together with RhoA comprise the Rho subfamily of proteins that are involved in morphological events. We now report the isolation of a rat cDNA encoding a 150-kDa protein, which specifically binds RhoA in its GTP form and contains an N-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain highly related to the human myotonic dystrophy kinase and a cysteine-rich domain toward the C terminus. The RhoA binding domain is unrelated to other p21 binding domains. Antibody raised against the kinase domain of the predicted protein, termed ROKα (for ROKα, RhoA-binding kinase), recognized a ubiquitous 150-kDa protein. The brain p150 purified by affinity chromatography with RhoA exhibited serine/threonine kinase activity. In cultured cells, immunoreactive p150 was recruited to membranes upon transfection with dominant positive RhoAV14 mutant and was localized with actin microfilaments at the cell periphery. These results are consistent with a role for the kinase ROKα as an effector for RhoA."
https://openalex.org/W2036123452,"Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 are small GTPases that regulate the formation of a variety of actin structures and the assembly of associated integrin complexes, but little is known about the target proteins that mediate their effects. Here we have used a motif-based search method to identify putative effector proteins for Rac and Cdc42. A search of the GenBank™ data base for similarity with the minimum Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) region of a potential effector protein p65PAK has identified over 25 proteins containing a similar motif from a range of different species. These candidate Cdc42/Rac-binding proteins include family members of the mixed lineage kinases (MLK), a novel tyrosine kinase from Drosophila melanogaster (DPR2), a human protein MSE55, and several novel yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans proteins. Two murine p65PAK isoforms and a candidate protein from C. elegans, F09F7.5, interact strongly with the GTP form of both Cdc42 and Rac, but not Rho in a filter binding assay. Three additional candidate proteins, DPR2, MSE55, and MLK3 showed binding to the GTP form of Cdc42 and weaker binding with Rac, and again no interaction with Rho. These results indicate that proteins containing the CRIB motif bind to Cdc42 and/or Rac in a GTP-dependent manner, and they may, therefore, participate in downstream signaling.

Members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases play a wide variety of cellular signaling roles that mediate proliferation and differentiation, cytoskeletal organization, protein transport, and secretion. The Ras GTPases have been studied most thoroughly, and now several components of the Ras signaling pathway have been identified using a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches(1Greenwald I. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1992; 68: 271-281Google Scholar, 2Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Google Scholar). A related family of GTPases, the Rho subfamily, consists of three Rho genes, two Rac genes, Cdc42 and its close homologue G25K, rhoG, and TC10(3Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Google Scholar). Early work in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, identified CDC42Sc as a protein required for bud emergence(4Johnson D. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 143-152Google Scholar, 5Drubin D.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 1093-1096Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the Rho subfamily members control the polymerization of actin and the assembly of focal complexes at the plasma membrane in response to extracellular signals(3Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Google Scholar, 6Chant J. Stowers L. Cell. 1995; 81: 1-4Google Scholar). For example, microinjection of Rho into serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells rapidly stimulates stress fiber and focal adhesion formation(7Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Google Scholar), while Rac induces membrane ruffles (8Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Google Scholar) and Cdc42 induces the formation of filopodia(9Nobes K. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Google Scholar). In addition to their effects on the actin cytoskeleton, Rho GTPases also have a role in regulating kinase signaling pathways. For example, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 stimulate a novel nuclear signaling pathway leading to transcriptional activation of the serum response element(10Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Google Scholar). Rac and Cdc42, but not Rho, have also been shown to activate the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway leading to c-Jun transcriptional activation (11Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Google Scholar, 12Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which the Rho subfamily of GTPases regulate these apparently diverse biological processes is still not clear. A large number of mammalian nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), related to the yeast exchange factor Cdc24 have been identified including dbl, vav, ost, ect2, lbc, and Tiam1, and they may provide tissue specificity or receptor-specific activation of Rho family members(2Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Google Scholar, 3Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Google Scholar). In addition, over 10 mammalian GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: GAPGTPase-activating proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseMLKmixed-lineage kinasePCRpolymerase chain reaction. for Rho family members have been described including BCR, p50rhoGAP, chimaerin, ABR, p190-A, p122, and myr-5(13Lamarche N. Hall A. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 436-440Google Scholar). The ability of these GAP proteins to interact with GTPases in a GTP-dependent manner suggests that in addition to being negative regulators, they may also act as effector proteins. The multidomain nature of many of these GAPs further supports this notion; for example, in addition to the GAP domain, p190 has a GTPase domain(14Settleman J. Narasimhan V. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 539-549Google Scholar), p122 interacts with phospholipase δ (15Homma Y. Emori Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 286-291Google Scholar), and the myosin family member, myr5, binds to actin(16Reinhard J. Scheel A.A. Diekmann D. Hall A. Ruppert C. Bahler M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 697-704Google Scholar). GTPase-activating protein glutathione S-transferase mixed-lineage kinase polymerase chain reaction. The identification of effector proteins for Rho-related GTPases is the first step toward defining their biological activity, and a number of candidate proteins have already been reported. The target protein involved in Rac-mediated activation of the NADPH oxidase complex in phagocytic cells has been identified as p67Phox(17Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Google Scholar). Although the Rac interactive site has been mapped to the amino-terminal 199 amino acids of the protein, no significant similarities have so far been found between this sequence and other sequences in the data base. A tyrosine kinase containing a SH3 domain, p120ACK, has been shown to bind specifically to Cdc42 in a GTP-dependent manner, although its biological role is unclear(18Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Google Scholar). Another protein, the serine/threonine kinase p65PAK, binds to both Cdc42 and Rac (but not Rho) in a GTP-dependent manner, but again it is not known whether p65PAK mediates any of the described biological effects of these GTPases(19Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Google Scholar, 20Martin G.S. Bollag G. McCormick F. Abo A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1970-1978Google Scholar). Interestingly, p120ACK and p65PAK do have some sequence similarities in a region outside the kinase domain that represents an interactive site for Cdc42/Rac GTPases(19Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Google Scholar). In this report, we have localized the Cdc42 binding site of a murine p65PAK isoform to a minimal conserved region of 16 amino acids. Using this small protein motif, we have searched the GenBank™ data bases and identified 25 potential Cdc42- and/or Rac-binding proteins. In vitro binding assays confirm that several of these proteins bind to Cdc42 and/or Rac in a GTP-dependent fashion. Not all of these newly identified proteins are kinases, suggesting a role for other types of proteins in downstream signaling events mediated by the Rho family proteins. Two murine p65PAK isoforms were obtained by screening a 14-day embryo library with a PCR product from the kinase domain (19Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Google Scholar) of the rat p65PAK. 2P. D. Burbelo, D. Drechsel, and A. Hall, manuscript in preparation. One of the isoforms, p65PAK-α, is the mouse homologue of rat p65PAK (98% amino acid identity), while the second, p65PAK-β, is a distinct isoform (81% identity to rat p65PAK). DPR2 (21Ito M. Matsui T. Taniguch T. Chihara K. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 139: 215-218Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. T. Matsui (Kobe University School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan). The MSE55 cDNA has been described previously (22Bahou W.F. Campbell A.D. Wicha M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13986-13992Google Scholar) and was a gift from Dr. W. Bahou (State University of New York). A Caenorhabditis elegans cDNA, cm12 g10, coding for the predicted F09F7.5 gene product, was a kind gift from Dr. L. Nabarocki (University College London, London, United Kingdom). MLK3 was cloned using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from HT-1080 mRNA using the published nucleotide sequence(23Ing Y.L. Leung I.W.L. Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.C. Lassam N.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1745-1750Google Scholar). PLC-β1 cDNA was described previously (24Katan M. Kriz R.W. Totty N. Philip R. Meldrum E. Aldape R.A. Knopf J.L. Parker P. Cell. 1988; 54: 171-177Google Scholar) and was a gift from Dr. P. Parker (ICRF, London, UK). Native major sperm protein (MSP) protein was purified from Ascaris suum(25Sepsenwol S. Ris H. Roberts T.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 55-66Google Scholar) and was a gift from Dr. M. Stewart (MRC at Cambridge University). cDNA fragments were generated by restriction enzymes or PCR and subcloned into the pGEX-4T-3 bacterial expression. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Fusion proteins were made as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins induced in bacteria by isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside treatment, purified on a glutathione-affinity column as described by the manufacturer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and checked for protein integrity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The following constructs were used: p65PAK-α (full-length, residues 1-545), p65PAK-β-Δ1 (residues 29-546), p65PAK-β-Δ2 (residues 118-546), p65PAK-β-Δ3 (residues 29-90), DPR2 (residues 460-541), MSE55 (residues 11-120), F09F7.5 (residues 12-59), MLK3 (residues 454-538), and PLC-β1 (residues 560-726). Syn-1 was derived using two complementary oligonucleotides containing the amino acid sequence EISLALREFHLNHVGLE and subcloned in-frame into the EcoRI-XhoI site of pGEX-4T-3. Protein-protein interactions were visualized using a dot-blot assay. GST-fusion proteins were spotted onto a nitrocellulose filter which was subsequently incubated with radiolabeled GTPase. The various proteins (1 μg) were spotted onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell, BA 85) and the filter was blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 5% dried milk powder. Recombinant L63 rhoA, L61 cdc42 (G25K isoform), or L61 rac1 (0.5 μg) was incubated with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP (6000 Ci/mmol) for 10 min at 30°C in 30 μl of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Nucleotide exchange was stopped on ice by adding MgCl2 to 10 mM. The nitrocellulose filter was washed twice with buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol) and then incubated in 10 ml of buffer A containing 5% dried milk containing the [γ-32P]GTP-bound protein. After incubation for 5 min at 4°C, the membrane was washed three times with cold buffer A containing 5% dried milk and autoradiographed to visualize the bound GTPase. The nucleotide requirement for binding of each of these proteins was tested using proteins immobilized to glutathione-agarose resin similar to that described previously(17Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Google Scholar). Approximately 5 μg of p65PAK-α and -β, FO9F7.5, DPR2, MSE55, and GST, and 10 μg of both MLK-3 and Syn-1 were used in these binding assays. The nucleotide exchange reaction was performed with either 10 μCi of [3H]GTP or [3H]GDP (7 Ci/mmol; Amersham) essentially as above except with 0.5 μg of recombinant V12cdc42. Following the nucleotide exchange reaction, the labeled GTPases were added to the glutathione beads containing the different proteins for 5 min on ice with occasional mixing. The tubes were then microcentrifuged for 20 s, and the supernatant was discarded. Following four washes with buffer A, the washed resin was subjected to liquid scintillation counting. The binding to each of the beads was expressed as a percentage of input counts. Previously, a 40-amino acid region of rat p65 was shown to contain the binding site for Cdc42 and Rac and reported to have some sequence similarity with two other Cdc42-binding proteins, p120ACK and STE20 (19Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Google Scholar). Cloning of two murine p65PAK isoforms, p65PAK-α (the murine homologue of rat p65PAK) and p65PAK-β revealed that they both contain high sequence conservation around this binding site.2 The murine p65PAK-α and -β isoforms were expressed as GST-fusion proteins and, using a filter binding assay, were shown to bind to Rac and Cdc42, but not to Rho as expected (Fig. 1). A truncated p65PAK-β construct, GST-p65PAK-β-Δ3, continued to show strong Cdc42 binding, although binding to Rac was reduced (Fig. 1). The ability of p65PAK-β-Δ3 to bind to Cdc42/Rac and its limited amino acid homology with the two other Cdc42/Rac-binding proteins p120ACK and STE20 suggested that a region of approximately 16 rather than 40 amino acid residues (corresponding to amino acid residues 74-89 within rat p65PAK-α) might be sufficient for binding to Cdc42/Rac. In order to identify potential new binding proteins for Cdc42 and Rac, we performed an iterative search of the GenBank™ protein data base using the BLASTp algorithm(26Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar). The initial query sequence with the conserved Cdc42/Rac binding site in rat p65PAK-α (residues 74-89) revealed significant matches to numerous other proteins shown in Fig. 2. Sites within these proteins along with the corresponding sequences in p120ACK and STE20 were then used to research the data base to identify additional proteins containing this motif. Finally, a FASTA (27Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Google Scholar) search of GenBank™ with each of the potential proteins turned up partial cDNAs for additional proteins. In total, over 25 distinct proteins from a variety of organisms were identified that contain a potential Cdc42 binding motif (Fig. 2). We propose that this motif be termed CRIB for Cdc42/Rac interactive binding motif. The CRIB motif occurs in both kinases and non-kinase proteins. For example, one of the CRIB-containing proteins, DPR2, is a Drosophila tyrosine kinase(21Ito M. Matsui T. Taniguch T. Chihara K. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 139: 215-218Google Scholar), which shows similarity in the kinase domain to pp125FAK, c-Abl, and p120ACK. Several serine/threonine kinase including at least 3 isoforms of p65PAK and two human and three yeast kinases also contain a potential CRIB motif. In addition, several members of the MLK family of serine/threonine kinases also contain a protein sequence resembling a CRIB motif. Two different yeast kinases encoded by X82499 and Z48149, contain identical CRIB motifs. Non-kinase CRIB-containing proteins include a human sequence MSE55 (and two related genes, accession numbers T06431 and T75138/F12871), WASP, a human gene responsible for Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome(28Derry J.M.J. Ochs H.D. Francke U. Cell. 1994; 78: 635-644Google Scholar), three different C. elegans genes (F09F7.5, T2365.3, and B0280.2) and two potential yeast genes (P38785 and D9740.18). Several of the proteins containing the CRIB motif were subcloned into the pGEX-4T-3 bacterial expression vector to test the prediction that these proteins would interact with Cdc42 and/or Rac. Fusion proteins were purified by glutathione affinity chromatography following induction by isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. These proteins included the Drosophila tyrosine kinase DPR2, human MSE55, and human MLK3 and an uncharacterized C. elegans protein, F09F7.5, encoded by the cDNA cm12 g10. In addition, a synthetic 17-amino acid fragment (Syn-1) and two additional proteins with weaker consensus CRIB motifs were also tested; PLC-β1 (4/8 match) (24Katan M. Kriz R.W. Totty N. Philip R. Meldrum E. Aldape R.A. Knopf J.L. Parker P. Cell. 1988; 54: 171-177Google Scholar) and MSP (3/8 match)(25Sepsenwol S. Ris H. Roberts T.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 55-66Google Scholar). These fusion proteins were assessed for binding to Cdc42, Rac, and Rho using a filter binding assay and GST-rhoGAP (which binds to all three GTPases) was used as a positive control(29Lancaster C.A. Taylor-Harris P.M. Self A.J. Brill S. van Erp H.E. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1137-1142Google Scholar). The α and β isoforms of p65PAK, FO9F7.5, DPR2, MSE55, and MLK3 proteins, were found to bind to the constitutively activated form of Cdc42 (Leu substituted for Gln at codon 61) (Fig. 3). All six proteins also bind equally well to wild type Cdc42 (data not shown). However, of these, only the p65PAK proteins, and the C. elegans protein FO9F7.5, bound equally well to Rac and Cdc42, while DPR2, MSE55, and MLK3 showed weaker binding to Rac than Cdc42 (Fig. 3). A short 17-amino acid residue peptide, Syn-1, containing a proline to alanine mutation within the consensus sequence, also showed weak binding to both Rac and Cdc42. None of the CRIB proteins tested showed binding to Rho (Fig. 3). Neither PLC-β1 nor MSP showed binding to Cdc42, Rac, or Rho (Fig. 3). A summary of the binding characteristics of potential CRIB proteins to Cdc42 and Rac is shown in Fig. 2. The guanine nucleotide dependence of Cdc42 binding to these proteins was investigated using a glutathione-agarose bead assay. Significant binding of p65PAK-α and -β, FO9F7.5, MSE55, DPR2, MLK3, and Syn-1 was detected to the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 (Fig. 4), but not to the GDP-bound form of Cdc42. The results are consistent with previous reports showing the GTP-dependent binding of p120ACK(18Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Google Scholar) and p65PAK(19Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Google Scholar, 20Martin G.S. Bollag G. McCormick F. Abo A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1970-1978Google Scholar) and are consistent with these proteins being candidate effectors of Cdc42 and Rac biological activities. In conclusion, we have delineated a short motif (the CRIB motif) in over 10 distinct proteins that confers binding to the Cdc42 and/or Rac GTPases. At least another 15 proteins have been identified by a data base search that contain a potential CRIB site. The length of the CRIB motif is approximately 16 amino acids containing a region of variable length between the two halves of the binding motif. The CRIB motif contains eight core amino acids with the sequence I-S-X-P-(X)2-4-F-X-H-X-X-H-V-G. It is interesting to note that proteins with one or two differences within the core sequence can still show binding to Cdc42/Rac. Of the proteins shown to contain a functional CRIB motif, only the kinases have a defined biochemical activity. In addition to the SH3-containing kinase p120ACK, a new Drosophila tyrosine kinase, DPR2, was found to contain the CRIB motif. Although the CRIB domains are found at a relatively similar distance after the kinase domains, DPR2 is unlikely to be the Drosophila homologue of p120ACK, since it lacks a SH3 domain and the overall amino acid similarity is low. In addition to the p65PAK family of kinases, a new serine/threonine kinase family, the MLK kinases, were found to contain a potential CRIB motif. To date, there appears to be at least four members of the MLK family including MLK1(30Dorrow D.S. Devereux L. Dietzsch E. De Kretser T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 701-710Google Scholar), MLK2/MST(30Dorrow D.S. Devereux L. Dietzsch E. De Kretser T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 701-710Google Scholar, 31Katoh M. Hirai M. Sugimura T. Terada M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1447-1451Google Scholar), MLK3/SPRK/PTK1(32Gallo K.A. Mark M.R. Scadden D.T. Wang Z. Gu Q. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15092-15100Google Scholar, 23Ing Y.L. Leung I.W.L. Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.C. Lassam N.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1745-1750Google Scholar, 33Ezoe K.E. Lee S.T. Strunk K.M. Spritz R.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 935-938Google Scholar), and DLK(34Holzman L.B. Merritt S.E. Fan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30808-30817Google Scholar). All four of these kinases share a characteristic hybrid kinase domain between serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, although SPRK/MLK3 (23Ing Y.L. Leung I.W.L. Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.C. Lassam N.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1745-1750Google Scholar) and DLK (34Holzman L.B. Merritt S.E. Fan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30808-30817Google Scholar) have now been shown to possess serine/threonine catalytic activity. In addition, all four MLK members contain putative α-helical leucine zipper motifs COOH-terminal to the kinase domain, although little is known of the function of this region. One might expect that the activity of at least MLK2 and MLK3 kinases will be stimulated following Cdc42/Rac binding as seen with p65PAK(19Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Google Scholar, 20Martin G.S. Bollag G. McCormick F. Abo A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1970-1978Google Scholar), but this has yet to be tested. The biochemical function of the non-kinases containing the CRIB motif is not clear at all. Some of these proteins also contain proline-rich regions (e.g. F09F7.5 and MSE55) raising the possibility that they might act as adapters and interact with SH3-containing protein(s) or other polyproline-binding proteins such as profilin. The identification of so many potential effectors for Cdc42 and Rac is quite surprising. However, numerous activities have already been ascribed to Rac and Cdc42, and each of these activities may require a distinct effector(s). Rac regulates the assembly of focal complexes and the polymerization of actin in lamellipodia, it has an essential role in Ras-induced cellular transformation and can act as an oncogene in its own right(35Qiu R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons F. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Google Scholar), and it regulates the activity of cPLA2(36Peppelenbosch M.P. Qiu R.-G. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Tertoolen L.G.J. de Laat S.W. McCormick F. Hall A. Symons M.H. Bos J.L. Cell. 1995; 81: 849-856Google Scholar). Rac and Cdc42 can also activate the JNK kinase cascade (11Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Google Scholar, 12Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Google Scholar) and in Drosophila both Rac and Cdc42 have been shown to be involved in the extension of neuronal growth cones(37Luo L. Liao Y.J. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1787-1802Google Scholar). The identification of proteins containing the CRIB motif should aid in dissecting the molecular mechanisms by which Cdc42/Rac GTPases regulate these processes.

https://openalex.org/W2138033100,"Studies of gene regulation by oxygen have recently defined the existence of a widely operative system that responds to hypoxia but not mitochondrial inhibitors and involves the induction of a DNA-binding complex termed hypoxia-inducible factor 1. This system has been implicated in the regulation of erythropoietin, certain angiogenic growth factors, and particular glycolytic isoenzymes. The glucose transporter Glut-1 is induced by both hypoxia and mitochondrial inhibitors, implying the operation of a different mechanism of oxygen sensing. To explore that possibility, we analyzed the cisacting sequences that convey these responses. An enhancer lying 5' to the mouse Glut-1 gene was found to convey responses both to hypoxia and to the mitochondrial inhibitors, azide and rotenone. However, detailed analysis of this enhancer demonstrated that distinct elements responded to hypoxia and the mitochondrial inhibitors. The response to hypoxia was mediated by sequences that contained a functionally critical, although atypical, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 binding site, whereas sequences lying approximately 100 nucleotides 5' to this site, which contained a critical serum response element, conveyed responses to the mitochondrial inhibitors. Thus, rather than reflecting an entirely different mechanism of oxygen sensing, regulation of Glut-1 gene expression by hypoxia and mitochondrial inhibitors arises from the function of two different sensing systems. One of these responds to hypoxia alone and resembles that involved in erythropoietin regulation, while the other responds to mitochondrial inhibitors and involves activation of a serum response element."

NPY is expressed exclusively in neurons, whereas PYY and PP are produced primarily in gut endocrine cells. Several receptor subtypes have been identified pharmacologically, but only the NPY/PYY receptor of subtype Y1 has been cloned. This is a heptahelix receptor that couples to G proteins. We utilized Y1 sequence information from several species to clone a novel human receptor with 43% amino acid sequence identity to human Y1 and 53% identity in the transmembrane regions. The novel receptor displays a pharmacological profile that distinguishes it from all previously described NPY family receptors. It binds PP with an affinity (Ki) of 13.8 pM, PYY with 1.44 nM, and NPY with 9.9 nM. Because these data may identify the receptor as primarily a PP receptor, we have named it PP1. In stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells the PP1 receptor inhibits forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis. Northern hybridization detected mRNA in colon, small intestine, pancreas, and prostate. As all three peptides are present in the gut through either endocrine release or innervation, all three peptides may be physiological ligands to the novel NPY family receptor PP1.

https://openalex.org/W1977448081,"The objective of this study was to identify a potential mechanism for S-nitrosation of proteins. Therefore, we assessed S-nitrosation of bovine serum albumin by dinitrosyl-iron-di-L-cysteine complex [(NO)2Fe(L-cysteine)2], a compound similar to naturally occurring iron-nitrosyls. Within 5-10 min, (NO)2Fe(L-cysteine)2 generated paramagnetic albumin-bound dinitrosyl-iron complex and S-nitrosoalbumin in a ratio of 4:1. Although S-nitroso-L-cysteine was concomitantly formed in low amounts, its concentration was not sufficient to account for formation of S-nitrosoalbumin via a trans-S-nitrosation reaction. Low oxygen tension did not affect S-nitrosation by the dinitrosyl-iron complex thus excluding the involvement of oxygenated NOx-species in the nitrosation reaction. Blockade of albumin histidine residues by pyrocarbonate, which prevented formation of dinitrosyl-iron-albumin complex, did not inhibit S-nitrosation of albumin. Thus, S-nitrosation of albumin by (NO)2Fe(L-cysteine)2 can proceed by direct attack of a nitrosyl moiety on the protein thiolate, without previous binding of the iron. We conclude that protein-bound dinitrosyl-iron complexes detected in high concentrations in certain tissues provide a reservoir of S-nitrosating species, e.g. low molecular dinitrosyl iron complexes.

S-Nitrosation of protein thiols by L-arginine- and nitrovasodilator-derived NO and/or subsequent further reaction of the S-nitrosothiol has been proposed to initiate widespread biological signal and effector pathways(1Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Google Scholar, 2Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Google Scholar, 3Brüne B. Dimmler S. Molina y Vedia L. Lapetina E.G. Life Sci. 1994; 54: 61-70Google Scholar). Direct evidence has been provided that a small fraction of circulating serum albumin in human and dogs is S-nitrosated under physiological conditions(4Stamler J.S. Jaraki O. Osborne J. Simon D.I. Keaney J. Vita J. Singel D. Valeri C.R. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7674-7677Google Scholar). Furthermore, indirect evidence suggests that S-nitrosation modulates the function of proteases, cytoskeletal proteins, membrane receptors(5Lipton S.A. Choi Y.-B. Pan Z.-H. Lei S.Z. Chen H.-S.V.

Biochem. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which proteins are S-nitrosated in vivo is unknown. It is likely that nitrosation proceedes by electrophilic attack of a nitrosyl-cation (NO+) or a partially positively charged NO (NOδ+) on a sufficiently reactive nucleophilic thiol group within target proteins(1Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Google Scholar). It has been proposed that naturally occurring metabolites of NO, such as peroxynitrite (ONOO-), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), or dinitrogentrioxide (N2O3), account for the S-nitrosation(1Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Google Scholar, 2Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Google Scholar). However, ONOO- was shown to oxidize thiols primarily by a mechanism not involving an S-nitrosothiol as an intermediate(13Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Google Scholar, 14Wink D. Nims R.W. Darbyshire J.F. Christodoulou D. Hanbauer I. Cox G.W. Laval F. Laval J. Cook J.A. Krishna M.C. DeGraff W.G. Mitchell J.B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 519-525Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is not known whether the steady state levels of NO2 and N2O3 attained in NO generating tissues are sufficiently high to account for biological S-nitrosation. It is therefore possible that other endogenous nitrosating species are operative. Since artificial metal-nitrosyls, like sodium nitroprusside, perform nitrosation of nucleophils (15Bottomley F. Accts. Chem. Res. 1978; 11: 158-163Google Scholar) we speculated that endogenous iron-nitrosyl complexes might do so as well(16Mülsch A. Drug Res. 1994; 44 (408–411.): 3aGoogle Scholar). These comprise so called dinitrosyl-iron complexes, which are generated by various cells and tissues concomitantly with NO(17Hibbs J.B. Taintor R.R. Vavrin Z. Granger D.L. Drapier J. Amber I.J.

Blumenfeld L.A. Zhurnal Strukt. Chimii (USSR). 1971; 12: 252-258Google Scholar). With regard to a ligand-exchange equilibrium between low mass thiol and protein thiol ligands(13Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Google Scholar, 21Mülsch A. Mordvintcev P. Vanin A. Busse R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1303-1308Google Scholar, 22Vanin A.F.

Biofizika (USSR). 1975; 20: 1068-1073Google Scholar), it is conceivable that low mass dinitrosyl-iron complexes exist biologically, albeit at low steady state levels. For instance, the addition of cell membrane-permeable low mass thiols effects intracellular mobilization and transmembraneous release of the dinitrosyl-iron moiety from intracellular proteins of NO-generating cells(21Mülsch A. Mordvintcev P. Vanin A. Busse R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1303-1308Google Scholar, 22Vanin A.F. Mordvintcev P.I. Hauschildt S. Mülsch A. Biochim. Biophys.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 252-256Google Scholar). In oxygenated aqueous media the biological half-life of the low molecular forms is inversely proportional to their concentration, amounting to a few seconds below 1 μM, and to about 10 min at 100 μM, for instance(31Mülsch A. Mordvintcev P.I. Vanin A.F. Busse R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 252-256Google Scholar). In contrast, proteinacious dinitrosyl-iron complexes are stable for hours in the absence of low mass thiols. According to theoretical considerations, the dinitrosyl-iron complex and related di- and tetranucleated structures bear a positive charge on the NO(29Burbaev D.S. Vanin A.F. Blumenfeld L.A. Zhurnal Strukt. Chimii (USSR). 1971; 12: 252-258Google Scholar, 32Butler A.R. Glidewell C. Li M.-H. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1988; 32: 335-393Google Scholar). The overall charge of the complex with two thiolate ligands is -1(32Butler A.R. Glidewell C. Li M.-H. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1988; 32: 335-393Google Scholar), if the charge of the thiolate residues is zero or neutralized (at isosbestic pH of L-cysteine, for instance). Thus, its paramagnetism is best explained by assuming a d7 electron configuration at the central iron ion (effective spin system S = 1/2). However, the formal oxidation state of the iron will be -1 if the NO ligands take pure nitrosyl character (NO+). In reality, some back donation of electron density to NO might decrease its electrophilicity, which then carries only a partial positive charge (δ+), similar to the situation with mononitrosyl-metal complexes (33Bottomley F. Accts. Chem. Res. 1978; 11: 158-163Google Scholar). Thus, this complex can be regarded as a natural source of NO+ or NOδ+, capable of S-nitrosation reactions according to Fig. Z1(RS = low mass thiol; R′SH = low mass or protein thiol). To test this hypothesis we assessed S-nitrosation of the free cysteine residue of bovine serum albumin (BSA) 1The abbreviations used are: BSAbovine serum albuminDEPCdiethylpyrocarbonateDNICdinitrosyl-iron-di-L-cysteine. by the dinitrosyl-iron-di-L-cysteine complex. We observed that this complex S-nitrosates albumin, in support of our hypothesis that dinitrosyl-iron complexes are intermediates in the biological NO:S-nitrosothiol pathway. bovine serum albumin diethylpyrocarbonate dinitrosyl-iron-di-L-cysteine. Bromophenol blue, fatty acid-free BSA (96-99% pure), L-cysteine, diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC), EDTA sodium salt, glutathione, N-ethylmaleimide, Sephadex G-25 were supplied by Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany. Xylene cyanole was from Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany. NO gas was obtained by reaction of FeSO4× 7H2O (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) with NaNO2 in 5 N HCl and was purified by low temperature high vacuum (p = 0.01 mm Hg) distillation (31Mülsch A. Mordvintcev P.I. Vanin A.F. Busse R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 252-256Google Scholar). Dinitrosyl-iron complex was prepared by mixing evacuated (10 min high vacuum) solutions of FeSO4 (5 mg/ml) and neutralized L-cysteine (72 mM) in a Thunberg-type reaction vessel under an atmosphere of pure NO gas (PNO 500 mm Hg; the NO was added 3 min before mixing). Upon mixing the solution immediately turned green. After 1 min the solution was evacuated for 2 min by high vacuum to remove excessive NO, immediately frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen. The molar ratio of Fe2+ to L-cysteine was 1:20. S-Nitroso-L-cysteine and S-nitroso-BSA were synthetized by mixing at 20°C either L-cysteine (100 mM) or fatty acid-free BSA (2 mM) with an equimolar amount of sodium nitrite in 0.5 M H2SO4 for 5 min. The S-nitrosothiols were frozen and stored at -70°C until use. The yields of S-nitroso-L-cysteine and S-nitroso-BSA were 90 and 100% with respect to free thiol added (BSA-thiol/BSA = 0.4 ± 0.04 mol/mol), as calculated from the typical S-nitrosothiol absorbance spectra, using the reported molar absorption coefficients: S-nitroso-L-cysteine, ɛ338 = 940 and ɛ545 = 22 M-1 cm-1 (MeOH; 34); and S-nitroso-BSA, ɛ334 = 870 (H2O; 35). BSA-thiols were titrated by 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)(36Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Google Scholar), using the absorbance of the thionitrobenzoate-anion at 412 nm (ɛ = 1.36 × 104M-1 cm-1) as a quantitative measure of thiol concentration. Protein was determined by the Bio-Rad method, using BSA as a standard. UV visible spectra were recorded on a Kontron 941 Plus spectrometer. S-Nitrosothiols were assessed by diazotization of β-naphthol and azo-coupling with N,N-ethylenediamine in the presence and absence of Hg2+ ions (3 mM) according to Saville(37Saville B. Analyst. 1958; 83: 670-672Google Scholar). Hg2+ releases NO+ from S-nitrosothiols(37Saville B. Analyst. 1958; 83: 670-672Google Scholar), which under acid conditions gives a positive Griess reaction, similar to acidified nitrite. The concentration of the red azo-compound was determined after 15 min by measuring the absorption at 570 nm on a microplate reader (MR 600, Dynatech, Alexandria, VA). In each experiment S-nitrosothiol/nitrite were determined in quadruplicate. The content of S-nitrosothiol accounted for the mean difference of absorption readings of Hg2+-containing versus Hg2+-free samples. A calibration curve was established in each experiment with freshly synthesized S-nitroso-L-cysteine and sodium nitrite as standards (1-100 μM). The detection limit was 1 μM. In some experiments the mixture of BSA, DNICs and the Griess reagent was frozen at specific time points and analyzed by EPR spectroscopy. Nitrate was determined after its reduction to nitrite by means of a cadmium reductor (38Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Google Scholar) and then assessed by the Griess reaction as described above. Electrophoresis of DNIC was performed at 5°C in a horizontal 1% (w/v) agarose slab gel (20 mM KH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.5 or 6.5). 70 mML-cysteine was included in the gel buffer to prevent decomposition of DNIC. Freshly thawed stock solutions of the complex (40 μl) were loaded in slots at equidistant positions from the electrodes in the middle of the gel. The anionic dyes bromphenol blue and xylene cyanole were loaded in separate slots. Electrophoresis was started immediately at 50 V. Electrophoretic mobility relative to the anionic dyes was estimated from the migration of the green band of DNIC after 1 h. Thereafter the band corresponding to DNIC was excised, frozen, and analyzed by EPR spectroscopy. EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker EPR 300E spectrometer at about 80 K with frozen aqueous solutions (0.6 ml) introduced into a quartz Dewar (5-mm inner diameter) chilled with liquid nitrogen. Some samples (25 μl of aqueous solution) were also recorded at 293 K in a quartz capillary tube (1 mm inner diameter). The EPR instrument was operated at a microwave frequency of 9.60 GHz, microwave power 20 mW, modulation frequency 100 kHz, modulation amplitude 5 Gauss, time constant 0.1-1.3 s. The concentration of DNIC was calculated by comparison with the EPR signal of a DNIC-L-cysteine standard based on double integration of the first derivative EPR signals(31Mülsch A. Mordvintcev P.I. Vanin A.F. Busse R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 252-256Google Scholar). The single thiol group accessible on BSA was blocked by incubation of the protein (2 mM in 0.1 M potassium Pi buffer, pH 7.4) for 5 min at 20°C with either 20 mMN-ethylmaleimide, or for 30 min with 6 mM HgCl2(13Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Google Scholar). Modification of histidine residues was performed by adding a 10-fold molar excess of DEPC and subsequent incubation for 2 h at 20°C(39Lee M. Arosio P. Cozzi A. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3679-3687Google Scholar). In control experiments it was verified that DEPC did not alter the EPR spectrum of low mass DNIC, indicating that both compounds did not directly interact. In frozen state at 77 K, DNIC exhibited an anisotropic EPR signal of axial symmetry with g factors g⊥ = 2.04 and g‖ = 2.01 (Fig. 1a)(28Woolum J.C. Tiezzi E. Commoner B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 160: 311-320Google Scholar, 29Burbaev D.S. Vanin A.F. Blumenfeld L.A. Zhurnal Strukt. Chimii (USSR). 1971; 12: 252-258Google Scholar, 30Vanin A.F. Kiladze S.V. Kubrina L.N.

In liquid phase at 20°C this spectrum was transformed into a narrow isotropic signal at gav = 2.03 with a 13 line hyperfine structure (Fig. 1e). The isotropy results from the high tumbling rate of the small paramagnetic molecule in liquid phase, which averages out any anisotropy of g values. The small coupling constant (A = 0.07 millitesla) and the absence of further fine structures points to a low spin configuration (S = 1/2). The unpaired electron is mainly localized on the iron atom(27McDonald C.C. Philips W.D. Mower H.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965; 87: 3319-3326Google Scholar, 29Burbaev D.S. Vanin A.F. Blumenfeld L.A. Zhurnal Strukt. Chimii (USSR). 1971; 12: 252-258Google Scholar, 32Butler A.R. Glidewell C. Li M.-H. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1988; 32: 335-393Google Scholar). The hyperfine splitting results from the interaction of the unpaired electron with four protons of the methylene groups of both L-cysteines and two nitrogen nuclei of the NO groups. Similar EPR spectra were obtained if DNIC was synthesized with glutathione or N-acetyl-L-cysteine instead of L-cysteine (data not shown). In agarose gel electrophoresis conducted at pH 6.5 (the isoelectric pH of L-cysteine) DNIC moved toward the anode, indicating that DNIC carries a net negative charge. The electrophoretic mobility of the complex was 0.38 times that of the anionic dyes bromphenol blue and 0.85 times that of xylene cyanol, which migrated 2.9 and 1.3 cm/h, respectively. The electrophoretic mobility of DNIC increased at pH 7.5, presumably due to increased negative charge on the L-cysteine-carboxylates. EPR spectroscopic analysis of the gel band bearing DNIC revealed the pure EPR spectrum of DNIC. Therefore, DNIC seems to migrate in the electric field as an intact complex anion. To assess its decomposition kinetics, DNIC was incubated at 37°C for defined periods and was then quickly frozen for cryogenic EPR analysis. The rate of decomposition of DNIC, as estimated from the decrease in the EPR signal intensity, was inversely correlated to the initial concentration of DNIC (Fig. 2). DNIC reacted immediately with BSA to form a paramagnetic protein-bound dinitrosyl-iron complex, amounting to about 0.4 mol of DNIC bound per mol of BSA. In the frozen state this BSA-DNIC exhibited an EPR spectrum identical to that of low mass DNIC (Fig. 1a). The macromolecular nature of the paramagnetic species was confirmed by showing that, in contrast to the EPR signal of low mass DNIC (Fig. 1e), the anisotropy of the BSA-DNIC EPR signal did not change in liquid phase at room temperature (data not shown). This preservation of anisotropy in liquid media is due to the slow rotation rate of paramagnetic macromolecules. According to its characteristic EPR features the dinitrosyl-iron moiety must be attached to two nuclear equivalent ligands(25Woolum J.C. Commoner B. Biochim. Biophys.

In the case of BSA-DNIC, these ligands are L-cysteines, one of which is the single reduced cysteinyl-thiol available on native BSA (cysteine 34), the other is provided by free L-cysteine. The apparently subequimolar recovery of BSA-DNIC (0.4 mol/mol BSA) resulted from the limited availability of cysteine 34, which is masked by disulfide formation with glutathione, L-cysteine, and BSA dimer formation in commercial BSA preparations(40Jocelyn P.C. Biochemistry of the SH Group. Academic Press, London1972Google Scholar). This was confirmed by titration of BSA with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). When BSA-DNIC was passed over a desalting column (Sephadex G-25) to remove excessive L-cysteine (DNIC was synthesized with 20 mol of L-cysteine per mol of iron, although only two L-cysteines are directly included into the complex), the EPR signal of BSA-DNIC changed to rhombic symmetry with g factors g1 = 2.05, g2- = 2.04, and g3 = 2.01 (Fig. 1b). These EPR features were reminiscent of dinitrosyl-iron complexes with one non-thiol ligand, presumably a histidine-imidazole, as described previously(28Woolum J.C. Tiezzi E. Commoner B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 160: 311-320Google Scholar, 29Burbaev D.S. Vanin A.F. Blumenfeld L.A. Zhurnal Strukt. Chimii (USSR). 1971; 12: 252-258Google Scholar, 30Vanin A.F. Kiladze S.V. Kubrina L.N. Biofizika (USSR). 1975; 20: 1068-1073Google Scholar). If the free thiol group of BSA was blocked by N-ethylmaleimide, or the preformed BSA-DNIC was treated with HgCl2, another rhombic EPR signal was generated, with g factor values g1 = 2.055, g2 = 2.035, and g3 = 2.01 (Fig. 1c). These EPR features were similar to that of imidazole-ligated DNIC(28Woolum J.C. Tiezzi E. Commoner B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 160: 311-320Google Scholar, 29Burbaev D.S. Vanin A.F. Blumenfeld L.A. Zhurnal Strukt. Chimii (USSR). 1971; 12: 252-258Google Scholar, 30Vanin A.F. Kiladze S.V. Kubrina L.N. Biofizika (USSR). 1975; 20: 1068-1073Google Scholar). Thus, it can be inferred that the dinitrosyl-iron moiety was attached to the thiol-blocked BSA via histidine nitrogen atoms. If, on the other hand, the histidine-imidazole residues of BSA were carboxylated by DEPC, formation of BSA-DNIC was completely abolished (data not shown). This finding suggests that the carboxylated histidine-imidazole restricts access of DNIC to the free thiol group of BSA and is compatible with structures of the diverse BSA-DNIC isoforms as shown in Fig. Z2. In the presence of acid (0.5 N HCl), DNIC and BSA-DNIC rapidly transformed into a paramagnetic complex of rhombic symmetry with g factor values g1 = 2.06, g2 = 2.05, and g3 = 2.02 (Fig. 1d). Formation of this complex was not affected by the Griess reagent. The “acid” complex formed by 40 μM DNIC decayed by apparent first order kinetics with a half-life of 20.4 ± 1.3 min (n = 8). HgCl2 did not affect the formation, stability, and EPR features of this complex (data not shown). To identify NOx from decomposed DNIC the latter was incubated at 37°C in 100 mM potassium Pi (pH 7.4) for defined periods and then assessed for nitrate, nitrite, and S-nitrosothiol (see “Experimental Procedures”). DNIC (20 μM in iron) generated 30 ± 2 μM NO2 after 3 min and 40 ± 1 μM after 30 min of incubation (n = 3). A freshly thawed stock solution of DNIC (3.6 mM) contained less than 0.5% S-nitrosothiol positive material, which waned within 3 min. Nitrate was not detectable at any time. These findings demonstrate that DNIC generates exclusively NO2 as a stable NOx metabolite. DNIC (0.75 mM) and BSA (1 mM) at 37°C rapidly and transiently generated an S-nitrosothiol, with a maximal concentration (85 ± 12 μM; n = 5) achieved at 5-8 min after mixing both reactants (Fig. 3). A similar transient S-nitrosation (maximally 40 ± 8 μMS-nitrosothiol) was observed after mixing DNIC (0.75 mM) with glutathione (20 mM). To study the influence of L-cysteine introduced with the DNIC stock solution on S-nitrosation of BSA, BSA-DNIC was generated as described before and then desalted by means of a Sephadex G-25 column (1.6 × 8 cm; 0.1 M potassium Pi buffer, pH 7.0). All manipulations were conducted at 4°C to decelerate the S-nitrosation reaction, although some S-nitrosation during the procedure could not be avoided. The protein fraction was quickly aliquoted, one aliquot was taken for EPR analysis to confirm the presence of BSA-DNIC, the other aliquot was halved and incubated in the presence and absence of 20 mML-cysteine. A low amount of S-nitrosoprotein co-eluted from the column (t = 0 min value) with BSA-DNIC, but did not further increase upon incubation at 37°C in the absence of L-cysteine (open symbols; Fig. 4). In contrast, the subsequent addition of L-cysteine largely enhanced formation of S-nitrosothiol by a time course similar to that shown in Fig. 3(closed symbols; Fig. 4). To ascertain that BSA and not a low mass thiol was S-nitrosated by DNIC, a preincubated (5 min, 37°C) mixture (0.8 ml) of BSA (1 mM) and DNIC (0.4 mM) was fractionated at 4°C into protein and low mass constituents by the aforementioned desalting column technique. Individual fractions (1 ml) were immediately assessed for S-nitrosothiol and protein. As shown in Fig. 5, the S-nitrosothiol eluted mainly with the protein fraction (27 ± 3% recovery with respect to DNIC), and only a minor part was associated with the low mass (salt) fraction (5 ± 2% recovery). Low mass S-nitrosothiols are principally capable of transnitrosation reactions according to the following equilibrium(35Meyer D.J. Kramer H. Özer N. Coles B. Ketterer B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 177-180Google Scholar, 41Barnett D.J. McAninly J. Williams D.L.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin. Trans. 1994; 2: 1131-1133Google Scholar, 42Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Google Scholar) : R1SNO+R2S−⇔R1S−+R2SNO(Eq. 1) To assess how efficiently low mass S-nitrosothiols could accomplish trans-S-nitrosation, BSA (0.5 mM) was incubated for 5 min with S-nitroso-L-cysteine and S-nitrosoglutathione (0.5 mM). This mixture (0.8 ml) was passed through the Sephadex column to analyze the protein and salt fraction for S-nitrosoprotein and low mass S-nitrosothiol, respectively. Significant trans-S-nitrosation of BSA (54 ± 4 nmol; n = 3) was detected with S-nitroso-L-cysteine, accounting for about 13% of the S-nitroso-L-cysteine added. About 26% of the S-nitroso-L-cysteine was recovered in the salt fraction (Fig. 6), and the remainder (about 60%) of S-nitroso-L-cysteine had decomposed to nitrite. In contrast, S-nitrosoglutathione added was recovered entirely in the salt fraction and did not generate measurable amounts of S-nitroso-BSA (data not shown). Addition of 8 mML-cysteine markedly decreased (5 ± 0.6-fold; n = 3) the extent of trans-S-nitrosation of BSA by S-nitroso-L-cysteine. The following experiments aimed to clarify whether or not carboxylation of BSA histidine with DEPC, which leaves the single BSA thiol in a reduced state, affected S-nitrosation of BSA by DNIC. Although formation of BSA-DNIC was reduced by 90%, S-nitrosation of BSA was altered (Fig. 7). These findings show that S-nitrosation of BSA by DNIC does not necessarily depend on previous formation of BSA-DNIC. To exclude the possibility that an oxygenated NOx species (14Wink D. Nims R.W. Darbyshire J.F. Christodoulou D. Hanbauer I. Cox G.W. Laval F. Laval J. Cook J.A. Krishna M.C. DeGraff W.G. Mitchell J.B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 519-525Google Scholar) generated by DNIC-derived NO and molecular oxygen accounted for S-nitrosation of BSA, the influence of reduced ambient oxygen tension on this reaction was analyzed. Buffered (100 mM potassium Pi, pH 7.4) solutions of BSA (1 mM) and DNIC (0.4 mM) were evacuated (p < 0.1 mm Hg) separately in a Thunberg flask until bubbling stopped and then mixed for 5 min. The mixture was removed by means of an airtight syringe and loaded on a desalting column, avoiding contact with air. The column was eluted with deoxygenated and nitrogen-saturated buffer and S-nitrosothiol was determined immediately in the eluting protein and salt fractions. The concentration of S-nitroso-BSA achieved in the anaerobic reaction mixture (70.5 ± 17.6 μM) was not significantly different from that obtained in parallel experiments conducted in the presence of ambient oxygen (63.6 ± 7.6 μM; n = 3). The objective of this investigation was to delineate a molecular mechanism accounting for biological S-nitrosation of protein thiols by NO(1Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J.

IKACh, an inwardly rectifying, potassium-selective channel stimulated by the β and γ subunit (Gβγ) of pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G proteins, mediates part of this process by hyperpolarizing pacemaker cells in sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes of the heart(4Wickman K.

All evidence indicates that the critical components involved in IKACh activation are confined to the membrane.

Cardiac IKACh is a heteromultimer of two homologous inward rectifier K+ channel subunits, GIRK1 (8Kubo Y. Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Recent evidence also suggests that a similar complex comprised of GIRK1 and GIRK2(10Lesage F. Duprat F. Fink M. Guillemare E. Coppola T. Lazdunski M. Hugnot J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 37-42Google Scholar), a structural and functional CIR homolog, forms a neuronal G protein-gated K+ channel(11Kofuji P. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6542-6546Google Scholar). We tested whether Gβγ binds directly to cardiac IKACh and, if so, to which subunit(s). By immunoprecipitation with subunit-specific antibodies, we were able to effectively purify whole cardiac IKACh channel and individual recombinant subunits and study binding of 125I-labeled Gβγ to these immunoprecipitated species. Here we show that Gβγ binds directly and specifically to the whole channel and to each IKACh subunit. Electrophysiological experiments with atrial myocytes were performed as described(2Wickman K.

The pipette and bath solutions were identical (in mM): 140 K+, 144 Cl-, 5 EGTA, 2 Mg2+, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2. Holding potential was -80 mV. Spaces in the upper trace (see Fig. 1A) represent only the time required to add the indicated substance to the bath. The lower, expanded trace in Fig. 1A was filtered (8-pole Bessel) at 2.5 kHz. The concentration-response analysis in Fig. 1B was performed as described(2Wickman K. Iniguez-Lluhi J. Davenport P. Taussig R.A. Krapivinsky G.B. Linder M.E. Gilman A. Clapham D.E.

The data were fit to the sigmoid function f(x) = (a - d)/(1 + (x/c)) + d using the Marquardt-Levenberg least squares curve-fitting algorithm (a and d represent the asymptotic maximum and minimum, respectively; c is Kact, the value of x at the inflection point; b is the Hill coefficient). G-proteins were isolated from bovine brain, separated into Gα and Gβγ subunits as described(12Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Google Scholar), and additionally purified by affinity chromatography over immobilized Gα (13Ueda N. Iniguez L.J.A. Lee E. Smrcka A.V. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4388-4395Google Scholar) or Gβγ (14Pang I.-H. Sternweis P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7814-7818Google Scholar). Bovine atrial plasma membranes were isolated as described(15Slaughter R.S. Sutko J.L. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3183-3190Google Scholar). Membranes were solubilized in 1.0% CHAPS-HEDN buffer (in mM: 10 HEPES, 1 EDTA, 1 dithiothreitol, and 100 NaCl) containing protease inhibitors. Two different antipeptide affinity-purified antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation experiments: anti-CIR (aCIRN2, amino acids 19-32, 0.5 μg/assay) and anti-GIRK1 (aCsh, amino acids 356-501, 0.3 μg/assay of atrial membrane protein and 0.7 μg/assay of Sf9 membrane protein). aCIRN2 did not immunoprecipitate in vitro translated GIRK1, and aCsh did not immunoprecipitate in vitro translated CIR (3Krapivinsky G. Gordon E. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Google Scholar). 2Krapivinsky, G., Krapivinsky, L., Velimirovic, B., Wickman, K., Navarro, B., and Clapham, D. E.(1995) J. Biol. Chem.270 28777-28779. Proteins were immunoprecipitated for 1.5 h at 4°C with corresponding antibody and PrA FF-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in the same buffer, followed by two washes with 0.1% CHAPS-HEDN. Anti-Gβ antibody was purchased from Calbiochem. For radiolabeling of G protein subunits, 20 μg of purified protein was labeled with 125I using 250 μCi of 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent (DuPont-NEN) yielding ~1 mol of 125I/3 mol of G-protein subunit. 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent, at this stoichiometry, does not prevent formation of a functional heterotrimer by labeled subunits. Both labeled Gα and Gβγ were able to bind their unlabeled immobilized counterparts, and incubation with AlF4- led to their dissociation (data not shown). For each binding assay, immunoprecipitates were obtained from 50 μg of atrial membrane protein and 50 or 500 μg of Sf9 membrane protein containing rCIR or rGIRK1, respectively. Immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated with 1.25 nM125I-Gβγ (~105 cpm) and unlabeled competitors in 0.1% CHAPS-HEDN and rotated for 15 min at room temperature (75 μl, total volume). Subsequently, the Immunobeads were washed four times by centrifugation, each time using 0.5 ml of the same ice-cold buffer. Total washing time was 7 min. In control experiments, the amount of bound Gβγ did not increase after 15 min at room temperature, and t1/2 for dissociation of bound Gβγ was ~90 min at 4°C. Bound Gβγ was counted using a γ counter. Data were fit to a competition equation with a single binding site(17Hulme E.C. Birdsall N.J.M. Hulme E.C. Receptor-Ligand Interactions. IRL Press, New York1992: 63-176Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses containing the 5′-untranslated region and coding region of GIRK1 and the coding region of CIR (3Krapivinsky G. Gordon E. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Google Scholar) were produced using the non-fusion baculovirus transfer vector pBlueBac III. The viruses were generated, isolated, and amplified as described (MaxBac, Invitrogen). Five days after infection, cells were harvested and homogenized in a hypotonic buffer. Membranes were then collected, solubilized, and immunoprecipitated as described for atrial membranes. The functional interaction between Gβγ and IKACh has been well studied in inside-out membrane patches from atrial myocytes. Bovine brain Gβγ reproducibly activates IKACh, and as expected for a Gβγ -dependent process, channel activity is inhibited by excess Gα-GDP (Fig. 1A; see also Refs. 1, 2, 6, and 7). Inhibition by Gα-GDP is overcome by excess Gβγ (Fig. 1A; see also (2Wickman K. Iniguez-Lluhi J. Davenport P. Taussig R.A. Krapivinsky G.B. Linder M.E. Gilman A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1994; 368: 255-257Google Scholar)). Because there was no statistically significant difference between the potency of bovine brain Gβγ and the potencies of all Gβγ recombinant subunits tested previously (except transducin Gβ1γ 1; (2Wickman K. Iniguez-Lluhi J. Davenport P. Taussig R.A. Krapivinsky G.B. Linder M.E. Gilman A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1994; 368: 255-257Google Scholar)), these data were averaged to generate the cumulative concentration-response relation shown in Fig. 1B. The resultant Kact and the Hill coefficient, as determined by the best fit of the cumulative data, were 5 nM and 1.5, respectively. This type of functional study cannot address whether there is a direct interaction between Gβγ and IKACh. To examine this issue, we studied Gβγ binding to the channel. An anti-peptide antibody (aCIRN2) directed against a unique amino-terminal domain of the CIR subunit immunoprecipitated CIR and coimmunoprecipitated GIRK1 from bovine atrial membranes.2 Endogenous cardiac Gβγ bound the native channel (Fig. 2A). Significantly, native cardiac Gβγ associated with the aCIRN2-immunoprecipitated channel complex only when atrial sarcolemmal membranes were treated with GTPγ S to activate endogenous G proteins. This suggests that prior to activation, G protein heterotrimers do not complex with IKACh. Although the association of native cardiac Gβγ with the channel was clear, the signal was inadequate for accurate quantitation of binding. To quantify binding of Gβγ to the channel, we measured the binding of 125I-labeled, purified bovine brain Gβγ to the immunoprecipitated atrial GIRK1-CIR complex (IKACh; Fig. 2B). The observed binding was due to an interaction between Gβγ and the channel as determined by competition with antigenic peptide. As shown in Fig. 2B, the presence of this peptide resulted in a significant decrease in Gβγ binding. Unlabeled Gβγ similarly decreased the level of binding of labeled Gβγ, demonstrating specificity of 125I-Gβγ binding in the concentration range under study. Finally, consistent with results from electrophysiological experiments, the presence of excess Gα-GDP, but not Gα-GTPγ S, prevented an interaction between Gβγ and IKACh (Fig. 2B). We conclude that Gβγ binds directly and specifically to native cardiac IKACh. Given the previous reports of IKACh stimulation by Gα-GTPγ S(18Codina J. Yatani A. Grenet D. Brown A.M. Birnbaumer L. Science. 1987; 236: 442-445Google Scholar), we tested whether 125I-Gα (GDP- or GTPγ S-bound) interacted physically with immunoprecipitated IKACh. The amount of 125I-Gα that bound to immunoprecipitates was insignificant (~100-fold less) in relation to the amount of bound Gβγ (data not shown). The binding constant for the interaction between Gβγ and IKACh was determined by competition between unlabeled and labeled Gβγ for channel binding sites(17Hulme E.C. Birdsall N.J.M. Hulme E.C. Receptor-Ligand Interactions. IRL Press, New York1992: 63-176Google Scholar). The binding data were most simply and adequately fit by a model with a single type of binding site. The Gβγ binding constant to cardiac IKACh immunoprecipitated by aCIRN2 was 55 nM (Fig. 2C). Thus, the affinity of the channel for Gβγ determined in this binding assay was ~10-fold lower than that suggested by results from electrophysiological experiments (Fig. 1B). Since this discrepancy could potentially be explained by antibody interference with Gβγ binding, we also determined the Gβγ binding constant to the channel using an immunoprecipitating antibody targeting the carboxyl terminus of the GIRK1 subunit of IKACh instead of the CIR subunit (aCsh(3Krapivinsky G. Gordon E. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Google Scholar)). The Gβγ binding affinity to aCsh and aCIRN2 immunoprecipitates were virtually identical (Fig. 2C), indicating that Gβγ binding was not affected by the immunoprecipitating antibody. Note that Lubrol PX, even at low concentrations (0.1%), significantly inhibited Gβγ binding, consistent with the inhibition by Lubrol PX of Gβγ -induced IKACh activation observed in patch-clamp experiments(19Nanavati C. Clapham D.E. Ito H. Kurachi Y. G Proteins and Signal Transduction. Rockefeller University Press, New York1990: 30-41Google Scholar). Given the results of the binding studies between Gβγ and native cardiac IKACh, the next logical step was to determine whether GIRK1, CIR, or both subunits interacted with Gβγ. Since the subunit-specific antibodies did not affect the binding of Gβγ to cardiac IKACh, they were used to study binding of Gβγ to GIRK1 and CIR subunits expressed and isolated from Sf9 cells. The control experiments used to confirm specificity of Gβγ binding to cardiac IKACh (see Fig. 2B) were also performed for the individually expressed subunits to assess the significance of any observed interactions. Both recombinant GIRK1 and CIR subunits demonstrated specific binding to Gβγ (Fig. 3, A and B). There was no evidence for cooperativity in the binding of Gβγ to either recombinant subunit; the data were well fit to a model with a single type of binding site. The apparent affinity of Gβγ for CIR was almost identical to that for cardiac IKACh (Kd = 50 nM; Fig. 3C) and slightly lower for GIRK1 (Kd = 125 nM). Despite the widespread electrophysiological evidence for membrane-delimited G protein activation of ion channels(20Wickman K. Clapham D.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 278-285Google Scholar), no biochemical evidence has been presented for a direct interaction between G protein subunits and channel proteins for two major reasons. First, in comparison to other G protein effectors such as adenylyl cyclase, cGMP phosphodiesterase, and phospholipase Cβ, channel proteins are of lower abundance in cells. Ion channels of specific subtypes number only a few thousand per cell. Second, the most dramatic example of a G protein-regulated ion channel is IKACh, a member of a class of ion channels only recently cloned(8Kubo Y. Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 802-806Google Scholar, 21Doupnik C.A. Lester H.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 268-277Google Scholar). The generation of immunoprecipitating antibodies to the IKACh channel subunits, GIRK1 and CIR, enabled us to develop an assay for Gβγ binding. The present work shows that Gβγ binds CIR, GIRK1, and the native cardiac channel with similar affinities. There are two findings in the current study that are discrepant with the electrophysiological data. The concentration of Gβγ eliciting half-maximal IKACh activity was ~5 nM in inside-out atrial patches, while the calculated Gβγ binding constant for the solubilized channel was ~50 nM. This difference could be simply due to the presence of the higher concentration of CHAPS in the binding reaction than in the electrophysiological experiments (1.6 versus 0.13 mM). On the other hand, Gβγ is hydrophobic and when added to an inside-out patch might concentrate in the membrane, giving a higher Gβγ concentration in the vicinity of the channel compared with the bath concentration. Thus, such functional studies might overestimate the real affinity of Gβγ for IKACh. Our electrophysiologic data were fit with a Hill coefficient of 1.5, suggesting mild cooperativity (but see (7Ito H. Tung R.T. Sugimoto T. Kobayashi I. Takahashi K. Katada T. Ui M. Kurach Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 99: 961-983Google Scholar)). However, we did not observe cooperativity in Gβγ binding to the channel or to its individual subunits. It is possible that detergent solubilization of the channel could influence interactions between Gβγ binding sites on the channel. Our current hypothesis is that one Gβγ binds each GIRK1 or CIR subunit of the IKACh heteromultimer to activate the channel. We have shown that IKACh is gated by Gβγ, not Gα(1Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1987; 325: 321-326Google Scholar, 2Wickman K. Iniguez-Lluhi J. Davenport P. Taussig R.A. Krapivinsky G.B. Linder M.E. Gilman A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1994; 368: 255-257Google Scholar), that IKACh is a heteromultimer of GIRK1 and CIR inward rectifier K+ channel subunits(3Krapivinsky G. Gordon E. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Google Scholar), and that Gβγ, not Gα, directly binds both subunits of cardiac IKACh. We have not localized the binding sites for Gβγ on the individual GIRK1 or CIR subunits, but Gβγ has been shown to associate with a fusion protein containing the full carboxyl-terminal residues of GIRK1(16Inanobe A. Morishige K.I. Takahashi N. Ito H. Yamada M. Takumi T. Nishina H. Takahashi K. Kanaho Y. Katada T. Kurachi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 1022-1028Google Scholar). Interestingly, our studies indicate that the antibodies raised against this entire region do not interfere with the observed binding of Gβγ to cardiac IKACh. Initially, the obvious candidate region for Gβγ binding in GIRK1 was the extreme ~150 carboxyl-terminal amino acids, since this domain was not present in the G protein-insensitive IRK (Kir 2.0) or ROMK (Kir 1.0) families. However, CIR, which binds Gβγ even better than GIRK1, has no corresponding region. Comparisons of the GIRK (Kir 3.0) family (including CIR) carboxyl-terminal regions do not reveal any unique GIRK family similarities, which might suggest a functional Gβγ -binding domain. In contrast, the amino termini of the GIRK family contain scattered conserved amino acids not found in ROMK and IRK subfamilies. Additional structure/function studies will address these issues. KGA (GIRK1) cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. H. Lester. Recombinant Gβγ subunits were made in the laboratory of Dr. Alfred Gilman(2Wickman K. Iniguez-Lluhi J. Davenport P. Taussig R.A.

INTRODUCTIONThe entry and release of water from cells is a fundamental process of life. Although biophysical features of membrane water permeability were recognized, the molecular pathway of transmembrane water movement remained unknown until discovery of the aquaporins, a family of proteins that permits selective, osmotic flow of water across cell membranes(1Chrispeels M.J. Agre P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 421-425Google Scholar). AQP1, the first recognized and characterized homolog, is abundant in mammalian red cells, renal proximal tubules, and other epithelia, where it is constitutively active(2Agre P. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Jung J.S. Raina S. Moon C. Guggino W.B. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F463-F476Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding several other mammalian aquaporins have been isolated by homology cloning(3Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1908-1912Google Scholar), and a weak water transporter is in lens (MIP)(13Mulders S.M. Preston G.M. Deen P.M.T. Guggino W.B. van Os C.H. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9010-9016Google Scholar).Aquaporins are expressed in diverse species. Plants express numerous different aquaporins in tonoplast or plasma membranes, and these proteins apparently play essential roles in maintenance of turgor and transpiration(14Maurel C. Reizer J. Schroeder J.I. Chrispeels M.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2241-2247Google Scholar). A homologous sequence is known to be expressed in Escherichia coli and other bacteria but encodes GlpF, the glycerol facilitator(15Heller K.B. Lin E.C.C. Wilson T.H. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 144: 274-278Google Scholar), which exhibits minimal water permeability (16Maurel C. Reizer J. Schroeder J.I. Chrispeels M.J. Saier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11869-11872Google Scholar). Despite phylogenetic analyses suggesting their common prokaryotic origin, no aquaporins have been reported in bacteria.Changes in the extracellular osmolarity elicit similar physical effects on cells throughout nature, and similarities are observed among the mechanisms of cellular osmoregulation. In bacteria, the cellular turgor is an essential feature based on the high osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm. Although some of the physiological and genetic responses to osmotic shifts among different bacteria are already known, the mechanisms of water transport during bacterial osmoregulation are poorly understood(17Csonka L.N. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 569-606Google Scholar, 18Lucht J.M. Bremer E. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 14: 3-20Google Scholar). Here we report the isolation and the molecular characterization of AqpZ, the first prokaryotic water channel. The presence of this aquaporin in Gram-positive and Gram-negative species suggests a widespread existence of this aquaporin among bacteria and suggests structural explanations for the functional differences between the sequence-related proteins AqpZ and GlpF.MATERIALS AND METHODSDNA Preparations and ScreeningBovine eyes were obtained from a local slaughterhouse. Eye cups were isolated by dissection, and an oligo(dT) cDNA library was prepared in the XhoI/EcoRI site of the Uni-ZAP XR vector (ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit, Stratagene). Aliquots of the library were used for PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s). with nested oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the sequences surrounding the Asn-Pro-Ala motifs in the aquaporins(11Jung J.S. Bhat R.V. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Baraban J.M. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13052-13056Google Scholar, 12Raina S. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1908-1912Google Scholar). A product of 387 bp was subcloned into the EcoRI-BamHI site of pBS-KS(+) and sequenced by double-strand dideoxynucleotide termination (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). This DNA fragment was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp.) by random DNA labeling (Boehringer Mannheim) and was used used to screen 3 × 105 plaques from the cDNA library. A positive plaque designated “aqpZ” was isolated, and the related pBS-SK(-) phagemid containing a 3.24-kilobase insert was recovered by in vivo excision and sequenced.Based on codon usage analysis of aqpZ(19Wada K. Aota S. Tsuchiya R. Ishibashi F. Gojobori T. Ikemura T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2367-2411Google Scholar), amplification of E. coli chromosomal DNA (DH5α strain) was undertaken by PCR. Specific oligonucleotides (GCBU3, 5′-TATCTGGTGAATGACTCGCC-3′ and GCBD2, 5′-TTGCTTAGCTCATGAAAGGA-3′) were designed corresponding to 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences of aqpZ and were used as primers (94°C, 1 min; 51°C, 1 min; 72°C, 1 min; 30 cycles). The resulting 917-bp PCR band was subcloned into pBS-KS(+) and sequenced.Genomic Southern Blot AnalysisTotal genomic DNA from bovine spleen and chromosomal DNA from selected Gram-positive and -nega-tive bacterial species were digested with BglI and AvaII, electrophoresed into 0.9% agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane (GeneScreen Plus, DuPont). The blots were hybridized at low or high stringency in a 10% dextran sulfate solution (1 M NaCl, 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 10% dextran sulfate, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7) with 32P-labeled DNA probes from coding sequences: 562-bp BglI-AvaII fragment of aqpZ 251-bp ApaI-HindIII fragment of glpF, or the 837-bp EcoRI-SmaI fragment of AQP1.Expression in Xenopus OocytesThe DraI-SmaI fragment of aqpZ containing 98 bp of the 5′-untranslated sequence, 162 bp of the 3′-untranslated sequence, and the entire aqpZ open reading frame was blunt-ligated into the BglII site of the Xenopus expression construct pXβG, which contains the HindIII-PstI insert of pSP64T in pBS-KS, and the pXβG-AQP1 construct was used as a control(20Preston G.M. Piazza-Carroll T. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Google Scholar). The pXβG-glpF construct was a generous gift from Dr. C. Maurel(16Maurel C. Reizer J. Schroeder J.I. Chrispeels M.J. Saier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11869-11872Google Scholar). Capped cRNAs were synthesized in vitro by using T3 RNA polymerase after a digestion with BamHI. Defolliculated stage V-VI oocytes from Xenopus laevis were injected with 50 nl of water or up to 25 ng of sample cRNAs and incubated in 200 mosM modified Barth's solution at 18°C.Osmotic Water Transport AssayAfter incubation for 2-5 days, the oocytes were transferred to 70 mosM modified Barth's solution at 21°C; oocyte swelling was monitored by videomicroscopy, and the coefficient of osmotic water permeability (Pf) was determined(20Preston G.M. Piazza-Carroll T. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Google Scholar). The Arrhenius activation energy (Eα) was calculated from the Pf values obtained swelling the oocytes at 10, 20, and 30°C.Oocyte Substrate Uptake AssaysUptake of [14C]glycerol (specific activity, 1.6 GBq/mmol, Amersham Corp.) or [14C]urea (specific activity, 2.0 GBq/mmol, Amersham Corp.) was measured after 4 days of incubation. Individual oocytes were added to 100 μl containing 200 mosM Barth's solution, 12 μM [14C]glycerol, or 16 μM [14C]urea and incubated for up to 30 min at 20 ± 2°C. The oocytes were then washed rapidly five times with ice-cold Barth's solution and lysed in 5% SDS (200 μl/oocyte) for liquid scintillation counting.Oocyte Voltage Clamp StudiesIon conductance was measured on oocytes after 3-5 days of incubation by two-electrode voltage clamp (20Preston G.M. Piazza-Carroll T. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONBacterial DNAs Homologous to AquaporinsThe two highly conserved tandem repeats within the amino acid sequences from all known aquaporin water transport proteins have been exploited for isolation of new cDNAs by polymerase chain amplifications using degenerate oligonucleotide primers. This approach carries the risk of amplifying cDNAs from contaminating tissues or even bacteria. Searches for aquaporin cDNAs from bovine ocular tissues obtained from slaughterhouses repeatedly led to the amplification of a DNA lacking the characteristic N-glycosylation consensus. Northern blots of mRNA from bovine ocular tissues failed to hybridize when the PCR product was used as a probe, and when codon sequences were checked, the DNA exhibited a distinct preference for bacterial usage. This PCR product was used to isolate identical coding sequences from a bovine eye cup cDNA library and from E. coli genomic DNA and is now designated aqpZ.Bovine genomic DNA as well as equivalent genomic samples of DNA from E. coli and other bacterial species were digested with AvaII and BglI and evaluated by Southern analysis with probes corresponding to the human water channel protein (AQP1), the novel DNA (aqpZ), and the glycerol facilitator from E. coli (glpF). As expected, AQP1 failed to hybridize with E. coli DNA but reacted with a multiple band in bovine DNA (Fig. 1, left). In contrast, the novel DNA (aqpZ) provided a striking band at 530 bp with E. coli DNA but failed to hybridize with bovine DNA (Fig. 1, center); this probe also hybridized with multiple bands in DNA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (atypical Gram-positive), Citrobacter freundii (Gram-negative), and Bacillus subtilis (Gram-positive). Hybridization of the blot with glpF revealed a weak band in DNA from B. subtilis (not visible in Fig. 1), one of the bands in the M. tuberculosis sample, and gave a striking band of ~1100 bp in the E. coli sample (Fig. 1, right).The deduced amino acid sequence of aqpZ was compared with sequences of mammalian (AQP1) and plant (γTIP) aquaporins and E. coli glpF (Fig. 2A). Alignments revealed the existence of residues known to be highly conserved in each of the transmembrane domains as well as the functionally important loops B and E. Hydropathy analysis of AqpZ was similar to that of other aquaporins (Fig. 2B) and is consistent with the existence of six transmembrane domains (21Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 1668-1673Google Scholar) and hydrophobic loops B and E, which may form the aqueous pore by dipping into the bilayer from opposite leaflets(22Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Google Scholar). The predicted topology of AqpZ contained distinctive features (Fig. 2C). The NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of AqpZ were shorter than corresponding domains in plant and mammalian homologs. A single cassette encoding 10 extra hydrophobic residues was present at the junction of transmembrane domain 3 and exofacial loop C in AqpZ, and two cassettes were present in GlpF (Fig. 2A).Figure 2Comparative alignment of deduced amino acid sequence, hydrophobicity analysis, and predicted membrane topology of AqpZ protein. A, deduced amino acid sequence alignments were performed by PILEUP program analysis of AqpZ, human AQP1, plant γTIP, and E. coli GlpF. Single boldface lines indicate the six predicted transmembrane domains (TM 1 to TM 6). The polypeptide sequences joining transmembrane domains are doubly underlined (connecting loops A-E). Positions with fully conserved residues are enclosed. The gaps show the amino acid cassettes among the sequences in loops A, C, D, and E.

The extracellular space corresponds to the E. coli periplasmic space.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Transport FunctionscRNAs corresponding to aqpZ and glpF were injected into Xenopus oocytes and assessed for permeability to glycerol or water (Fig. 3). As expected, water-injected control oocytes showed limited permeability to isotopically labeled glycerol. Oocytes injected with cRNA encoding AqpZ exhibited glycerol permeability equivalent to the control oocytes, whereas oocytes injected with cRNA encoding GlpF had a severalfold rise in glycerol permeability (Fig. 3A). In contrast, oocytes expressing AqpZ exhibited a marked increase in osmotic water permeability (Pf), while oocytes expressing GlpF featured only a modest increase in Pf (Fig. 3B). Similar to known aquaporin water transporters, the AqpZ oocytes exhibited an Arrhenius activation energy of 3.8 ± 1.5 kcal/mol, and consistent with the lack of a cysteine preceding the downstream Asn-Pro-Ala motif(21Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 1668-1673Google Scholar), incubation of AqpZ oocytes in HgCl2 did not significantly lower Pf (data not shown). In other studies of AqpZ oocytes, no newly expressed conductances were detected when transmembrane voltage was clamped at several different potentials, and no increased uptake of isotopically labeled urea was measured (data not shown).Figure 3Comparative transport functional analyses. A, [14C]glycerol influx was measured in oocytes injected with water (control) and 25 ng of cRNA for aqpZ or glpF and measured after 4 days of expression (see “Materials and Methods”). B, osmotic water permeability (P) measured on oocytes injected similarly. C, osmotic water permeability of oocytes compared with time of expression. Oocytes were injected with water (control), 25 ng of cRNA for aqpZ or glpF, or 10 ng of cRNA for AQP1 and incubated for 2-5 days before measurement of osmotic water permeability. Each bar or data point represents the mean ± S.E. of 8-12 individual oocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Previous studies reported an even lower Pf of oocytes injected with glpF cRNA and incubated for only 2-3 days(16Maurel C. Reizer J. Schroeder J.I. Chrispeels M.J. Saier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11869-11872Google Scholar), so a time course of expression and water transport was performed. After 2 days of expression, the AqpZ oocytes exhibited Pf values significantly below those expressing AQP1 cRNA, but after additional days of incubation, the water permeability of AqpZ oocytes rose significantly, whereas the permeability of GlpF oocytes remained low (Fig. 3C). While it is not known why the aqpZ cRNA was expressed more slowly, it may reflect the different preferences in codon usage or it may be a result of defective membrane targeting of AqpZ protein, which lacks a long COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain that is apparently needed for efficient transit to the plasmalemma(22Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is apparent that despite highly related deduced amino acid sequences, the two bacterial proteins AqpZ and GlpF perform distinct transport functions.Evolution of the Aquaporin HomologsSequence comparisons of aqpZ, glpF, and genes for plant and animal aquaporins revealed a wide phylogenetic separation of the two bacterial genes. As indicated (Fig. 4) most members of the aquaporin family and related proteins contain amino acid sequences with highly conserved motifs (Fig. 2A), but overall the sequences were only 27-42% identical. Although evolutionary distances may only be inferred by computer sequence comparisons, the study demonstrates that aqpZ and glpF may have diverged very early; the yeast gene FPS1, which compensates for suppressed growth on fermentable sugars(23Van Aelst L. Hohmann S. Zimmermann F.K. Jans A.W.H. Thevelein J.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2095-2104Google Scholar), and the product of mammalian gene AQP3, which transports a small amount of glycerol in addition to water(7Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi Y. Gojobori T. Marumo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13052-13056Google Scholar, 8Echevarria M. Windhager E.E. Frindt G. Proc.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21845-21849Google Scholar), may have originated from a common prokaryotic gene related to glpF. Likewise, the plant and the other mammalian aquaporins may have originated from a prokaryotic gene related to aqpZ. The highest homology is shared with NOD26, a plant gene expressed in peribacteroid root nodules (24Weaver C.D. Crombie B. Stacey G. Roberts D.M. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 222-227Google Scholar).Figure 4Phylogenetic analysis of AqpZ, other aquaporins, and homologs. Deduced amino acid sequences from the indicated aquaporins and homologous proteins were aligned by PILEUP program analysis (version 7.1, Vax computer system). The percent identity compared with AqpZ is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The relative simplicity of bacterial genomes is consistent with functional requirements of all genes. While it is premature to conclude what role AqpZ plays in bacterial metabolism, it seems highly likely that it may be expressed for management of osmotic stress(17Csonka L.N. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 569-606Google Scholar, 18Lucht J.M. Bremer E. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 14: 3-20Google Scholar), cell growth and division, or desiccation, which may be involved in chronic dormancy. The presence of two related genes, aqpZ and glpF, encoding proteins with distinct transport functions implies the need for both, and the sequence differences between these genes may provide structural insight into their distinctive transport functions. For example, the presence of only one cassette insert in loop C of AqpZ but two cassette inserts in loop C and another cassette insert in loop E of GlpF may be of structural significance. Indeed, genomic Southern analysis (Fig. 1) is consistent with the widespread existence of aqpZ-related genes among bacterial species. In contrast to plant genomes that contain numerous aquaporin genes, 2M.

Of note, the H. influenzae gene glpF 690 and the E. coli glpF are contained within operons encoding other known glycerol metabolic enzymes, whereas the other H. influenzae gene, glpF 1017, and E. coli aqpZ do not exist within operons. These observations lead us to speculate that dual existence of the functionally distinct genes aqpZ and glpF may be a general feature of bacterial species. INTRODUCTIONThe entry and release of water from cells is a fundamental process of life. Although biophysical features of membrane water permeability were recognized, the molecular pathway of transmembrane water movement remained unknown until discovery of the aquaporins, a family of proteins that permits selective, osmotic flow of water across cell membranes(1Chrispeels M.J. Agre P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 421-425Google Scholar). AQP1, the first recognized and characterized homolog, is abundant in mammalian red cells, renal proximal tubules, and other epithelia, where it is constitutively active(2Agre P. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Jung J.S. Raina S. Moon C. Guggino W.B. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F463-F476Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding several other mammalian aquaporins have been isolated by homology cloning(3Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Skach W. Matthay M.A. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5497-5500Google Scholar, 11Jung J.S. Bhat R.V. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Baraban J.M. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1908-1912Google Scholar), and a weak water transporter is in lens (MIP)(13Mulders S.M. Preston G.M. Deen P.M.T. Guggino W.B. van Os C.H. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9010-9016Google Scholar).Aquaporins are expressed in diverse species. Plants express numerous different aquaporins in tonoplast or plasma membranes, and these proteins apparently play essential roles in maintenance of turgor and transpiration(14Maurel C. Reizer J. Schroeder J.I. Chrispeels M.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2241-2247Google Scholar). A homologous sequence is known to be expressed in Escherichia coli and other bacteria but encodes GlpF, the glycerol facilitator(15Heller K.B. Lin E.C.C. Wilson T.H. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 144: 274-278Google Scholar), which exhibits minimal water permeability (16Maurel C. Reizer J. Schroeder J.I. Chrispeels M.J. Saier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11869-11872Google Scholar). Despite phylogenetic analyses suggesting their common prokaryotic origin, no aquaporins have been reported in bacteria.Changes in the extracellular osmolarity elicit similar physical effects on cells throughout nature, and similarities are observed among the mechanisms of cellular osmoregulation. In bacteria, the cellular turgor is an essential feature based on the high osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm. Although some of the physiological and genetic responses to osmotic shifts among different bacteria are already known, the mechanisms of water transport during bacterial osmoregulation are poorly understood(17Csonka L.N. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 569-606Google Scholar, 18Lucht J.M. Bremer E. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 14: 3-20Google Scholar). Here we report the isolation and the molecular characterization of AqpZ, the first prokaryotic water channel. The presence of this aquaporin in Gram-positive and Gram-negative species suggests a widespread existence of this aquaporin among bacteria and suggests structural explanations for the functional differences between the sequence-related proteins AqpZ and GlpF."
https://openalex.org/W2028222221,"The carbon storage regulator gene csrA has been shown previously to dramatically affect the biosynthesis of intracellular glycogen in Escherichia coli through its negative control of the expression of two glycogen biosynthetic operons and the gluconeogenic gene pckA (Romeo, T., Gong, M., Liu, M. Y., and Brun-Zinkernagel, A. M.(1993) J. Bacteriol. 175, 4744-4755). Examination of the effects of csrA on several enzymes, genes, and metabolites of central carbohydrate metabolism now establishes a more extensive role for csrA in directing intracellular carbon flux. Phosphoglucomutase and the gluconeogenic enzymes fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase were found to be under the negative control of csrA, and these enzyme activities were maximal during the early stationary phase of growth. The enzymes glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, triose-phosphate isomerase, and enolase were positively regulated by csrA. Thus, csrA exerts reciprocal effects on glycolysis versus gluconeogenesis and glycogen biosynthesis. The glycolytic isozymes pyruvate kinase F and A (encoded by pykF and pykA, respectively) and phosphofructokinase I and II (pfkA and pfkB, respectively) exhibited differential regulation via csrA. Since the individual members of these isozyme pairs are allosterically regulated by different cellular metabolites, csrA is also capable of fine-tuning the allosteric regulation of glycolysis. In contrast, the expression of genes of the pentose phosphate pathway was weakly or negligibly affected by csrA. The carbon storage regulator gene csrA has been shown previously to dramatically affect the biosynthesis of intracellular glycogen in Escherichia coli through its negative control of the expression of two glycogen biosynthetic operons and the gluconeogenic gene pckA (Romeo, T., Gong, M., Liu, M. Y., and Brun-Zinkernagel, A. M.(1993) J. Bacteriol. 175, 4744-4755). Examination of the effects of csrA on several enzymes, genes, and metabolites of central carbohydrate metabolism now establishes a more extensive role for csrA in directing intracellular carbon flux. Phosphoglucomutase and the gluconeogenic enzymes fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase were found to be under the negative control of csrA, and these enzyme activities were maximal during the early stationary phase of growth. The enzymes glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, triose-phosphate isomerase, and enolase were positively regulated by csrA. Thus, csrA exerts reciprocal effects on glycolysis versus gluconeogenesis and glycogen biosynthesis. The glycolytic isozymes pyruvate kinase F and A (encoded by pykF and pykA, respectively) and phosphofructokinase I and II (pfkA and pfkB, respectively) exhibited differential regulation via csrA. Since the individual members of these isozyme pairs are allosterically regulated by different cellular metabolites, csrA is also capable of fine-tuning the allosteric regulation of glycolysis. In contrast, the expression of genes of the pentose phosphate pathway was weakly or negligibly affected by csrA. The central routes of intermediary carbohydrate metabolism in Escherichia coli include the constitutive Embden-Meyerhof and pentose phosphate pathways along with the inducible Entner-Douderoff pathway(1Fraenkel D.G. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 142-150Google Scholar). The Embden-Meyerhof pathway is an amphibolic system and functions in both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Most of the reactions of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway are reversible in vivo, with the notable exceptions of the 6-phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) (Pfk) 1The abbreviations used are: Pfk6-phosphofructokinaseFBPfructose 1,6-bisphosphateFbpfructose-1,6-bisphosphatasePEPphosphoenolpyruvatePpsphosphoenolpyruvate synthetasePgmphosphoglucomutasePgiglucose-6-phosphate isomeraseTpitriose-phosphate isomeraseEnoenolasePykpyruvate kinasePckphosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinasebpbase pair(s). and pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) (Pyk) reactions, which are glycolytic and which provide key points of control for glycolysis. In E. coli both of these reactions are catalyzed by pairs of isozymes which are encoded by distinct genes and which respond allosterically to different cellular metabolites(2Kotlarz D. Garreau H. Buc H. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1975; 381: 257-268Google Scholar, 3Waygood E.B. Mort J.S. Sanwal B.D. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 277-282Google Scholar, 4Kotlarz D. Buc H. Eur. J.

FEBS Lett. 1983; 162: 420-422Google Scholar). During gluconeogenesis, these two steps of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway are dependent upon the enzymes fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) (Fbp) and phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase (EC 2.7.9.2) (Pps). Fbp activity is also allosterically regulated(10Fraenkel D.G. Pontremoli S. Horecker B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 114: 4-12Google Scholar). 6-phosphofructokinase fructose 1,6-bisphosphate fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase phosphoenolpyruvate phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase phosphoglucomutase glucose-6-phosphate isomerase triose-phosphate isomerase enolase pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase base pair(s). Although the allosteric regulation of central carbohydrate metabolism has been well studied in E. coli and in other bacteria, its genetic regulation has not. The structural genes of these pathways are generally regarded to be constitutively expressed(1Fraenkel D.G. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 142-150Google Scholar). While it is true that the levels of these enzymes do not change dramatically in response to various physiological requirements, it is also clear that the levels of many, if not all, of these enzymes respond to conditions such as oxygen availability and growth rate(11Farrish E.E. Baker II, H.V. Wolf Jr., R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 584-594Google Scholar, 12Hollywood N. Doelle H.W. Microbios. 1976; 17: 23-33Google Scholar, 13Reichelt J.L. Doelle H.W.

Biochem. 1978; 83: 479-484Google Scholar), suggesting that the genetic regulation of these pathways is also physiologically significant. During the transition from exponential growth into stationary phase the demand for biosynthetic metabolism decreases and E. coli as well as many other bacteria rapidly convert available carbohydrate into glycogen, which appears to function as a source of stored carbon and energy. The regulation of glycogen synthesis is complex and includes both allosteric and genetic components (reviewed in (17Krebs E.G. Preiss J. MTP Int. Rev. Sci. Carbohydr. Biochem. Ser. I. 1975; 5: 337-389Google Scholar, 18Preiss J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1984; 38: 419-458Google Scholar, 19Preiss J. Romeo T. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1989; 30: 183-233Google Scholar, 20Preiss J. Romeo T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 47: 299-329Google Scholar)). Our laboratory recently discovered a regulatory gene, csrA, which dramatically affects the biosynthesis of glycogen. A csrA::kanR insertion mutation results in the accumulation of approximately 20-fold higher levels of glycogen, which can reach a level of 1.6 mg of glycogen/mg of protein in the early stationary phase in this mutant(21Romeo T. Gong M. Liu M.Y. Brun-Zinkernagel A.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4744-4755Google Scholar). The csrA gene was found to negatively control the expression of the two structural genes of the glycogen biosynthetic pathway, glgC encoding ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.27) and glgB encoding glycogen branching enzyme (EC 2.4.1.18), as well as the gluconeogenic gene phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (EC 4.1.1.49) (Pck). The gene csrA was mapped at 58 min on the E. coli genome, between alaS and serV(22Romeo T. Gong M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5740-5741Google Scholar), and was shown to encode a 61-amino acid protein, CsrA(21Romeo T. Gong M. Liu M.Y. Brun-Zinkernagel A.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4744-4755Google Scholar). Recent studies on the mechanism of csrA-mediated regulation of glgC have shown that the CsrA protein greatly enhances the decay of glgC mRNA, an effect that involves the region overlapping or close to the ribosome binding site of glgC(23Liu M.Y. Yang H. Romeo T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2663-2672Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of the CsrA gene product was found to contain a KH domain, which has been proposed to function as an RNA-binding region of a diverse subset of RNA-binding proteins (24Gibson T.J. Thompson J.D. Heringa J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 361-366Google Scholar). Because the csrA::kanR mutation also affects cell surface properties, as exhibited by the adherence of mutant cells to glassware, and because the regulation of glycogen biosynthesis by csrA is mediated independently of the known global regulators of the glycogen operon glgCAP, cAMP, and ppGpp (25Romeo T. Black J. Preiss J. Curr. Microbiol. 1990; 21: 131-137Google Scholar, 26Romeo T. Preiss J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2773-2782Google Scholar, 39Romeo T. Kumar A. Preiss J. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 70: 363-376Google Scholar), it was previously suggested that csrA may encode a component of a novel global regulatory system(21Romeo T. Gong M. Liu M.Y. Brun-Zinkernagel A.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4744-4755Google Scholar). The present study is consistent with this possibility and firmly establishes a role for csrA in the regulation of central carbohydrate metabolism. The relevant properties of the strains, phage, and plasmids used in the present study are listed in Table 1.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Cultures were inoculated for growth curves by adding 1 volume of an overnight culture to 400 volumes of freshly prepared Kornberg medium (containing 0.5% glucose(26Romeo T. Preiss J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2773-2782Google Scholar)) and were grown at 37°C with rapid gyratory shaking. For detection of endogenous glycogen, cultures were streaked onto Kornberg agar medium containing 1% glucose, grown overnight at 37°C, and stained with iodine vapor(21Romeo T. Gong M. Liu M.Y. Brun-Zinkernagel A.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4744-4755Google Scholar). MacConkey agar (Difco) was used to determine the Lac phenotype. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (100 μg/ml), and diaminopimelic acid (50 μg/ml) were sterilized by filtration and were included as needed in the media. To study enzyme activities throughout the growth curve, cells were harvested at the indicated time points by centrifugation at 4°C, washed twice in the appropriate buffer, as described in the corresponding references below, weighed, and stored at -80°C until use. The cells (0.5 g) were thawed and suspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer and disrupted using an ice-cold French pressure cell at 10,000 p.s.i. The cell lysate was collected on ice and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatant solution was used to determine enzyme activity on the day of preparation and was assayed for total protein. Each of these experiments was performed in entirety at least twice. Previously published methods were used to assay the activities of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase(31Fraenkel D.G. Horecker B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1965; 90: 837-842Google Scholar), phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase(32Cooper R.A. Kornberg H.L. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 309-314Google Scholar), phosphoglucomutase (Pgm) (EC 5.4.2.2)(33Adhya S. Schwartz M. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 621-626Google Scholar), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (Pgi) (EC 5.3.1.9)(34Fraenkel D.G. Levisohn S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 1571-1578Google Scholar), phosphofructokinases I and II(2Kotlarz D. Garreau H. Buc H. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1975; 381: 257-268Google Scholar), triose-phosphate isomerase (Tpi) (EC 5.3.1.1)(35Rozacky E.E. Sawyer T.H. Barton R.A. Gracy R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 146: 312-320Google Scholar), enolase (Eno) (EC 4.2.1.11) (36Maitra P.K. Lobo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 475-488Google Scholar) and pyruvate kinases F and A(2Kotlarz D. Garreau H. Buc H. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1975; 381: 257-268Google Scholar). Each of the respective reactions was started by the addition of enzyme extract and was coupled to the reduction of NAD+ or the oxidation of NADPH, following the change in absorbance at 340 nm in a Gilford recording spectrophotometer, with the exception of the phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase assay, which was measured as the rate of ATP-dependent disappearance of pyruvate. Values for enzyme activities were determined within the linear range with respect to the amount of extract added, as determined for each and every sample. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as 1 μmol of product generated or substrate utilized per min under the published reaction conditions. Total protein was measured by the bicinchoninic acid method using bovine serum albumin as the standard(37Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase specific activity was assayed and calculated as described previously(25Romeo T. Black J. Preiss J. Curr. Microbiol. 1990; 21: 131-137Google Scholar). The metabolites ATP, ADP, AMP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) were extracted and were quantified fluorimetrically using a Shimadzu RF 5000U fluorometer, according to previously published methods(38Lowry O.H. Carter J. Ward J.B. Glaser L. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6511-6521Google Scholar). The reproducibility of these measurements was established by conducting at least three determinations for each sample. Transformation, P1 transduction, and other molecular biology techniques were conducted as described previously(26Romeo T. Preiss J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2773-2782Google Scholar, 21Romeo T. Gong M. Liu M.Y. Brun-Zinkernagel A.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4744-4755Google Scholar). In the absence of exogenous hexose, and even in the presence of glucose(31Fraenkel D.G. Horecker B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1965; 90: 837-842Google Scholar), the gluconeogenic enzymes are present and may be used to form glucose 1-phosphate, which in turn may be converted to a variety of compounds, including the precursor of bacterial glycogen, ADP-glucose. We previously obtained two kinds of preliminary evidence suggesting that csrA negatively regulates gluconeogenesis. First, the expression of a ′lacZ transcriptional fusion for the gene encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pckA, was elevated approximately 2-fold in a csrA::kanR mutant. Second, a multicopy plasmid which overexpresses the csrA gene, pCSR10, resulted in the inability of strains to grow on gluconeogenic compounds as sole sources of carbon(21Romeo T. Gong M. Liu M.Y. Brun-Zinkernagel A.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4744-4755Google Scholar). To further explore the potential role of csrA in regulating gluconeogenesis, the effects of csrA on the specific activities of Fbp and Pps were determined. Fig. 1(A and B) shows that Fbp specific activity increased from 7- to 10-fold as cultures progressed from the exponential phase into early stationary phase of growth and thereafter declined to mid-log levels. During the early stationary phase, the levels of Fbp were approximately 1.5-2-fold higher in the csrA::kanR mutant than in the isogenic csrA+ strain. As shown in Fig. 1B, the effects of the csrA::kanR mutation on Fbp were complemented by pCSR10. In fact, pCSR10-containing cells possessed significantly lower levels of Fbp activity than the csrA+ strain. The specific activity of Pps was 2-4-fold higher in the csrA::kanR mutant, and similar to that of Fbp, it was highest in both strains during the early stationary phase (Fig. 1C). Both gluconeogenesis and the uptake of glucose via the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system generate glucose 6-phosphate in the cell, which must be converted by the enzyme Pgm into glucose 1-phosphate to be used as a biosynthetic precursor of polysaccharides such as glycogen. The specific activity of Pgm was up to 4-fold higher in the csrA::kanR strain relative to the isogenic csrA+ strain (Fig. 1D). Pgm activity in both strains increased approximately 2-fold as cultures entered the stationary phase. The kinetics of expression of Fbp, Pps, and Pgm in the csrA::kanR mutant were approximately parallel to those of the isogenic csrA+ strain, as was shown previously for the expression of the glycogen biosynthetic genes and pckA, indicating that the regulation of these systems by csrA is superimposed upon the stationary phase control (21Romeo T. Gong M. Liu M.Y. Brun-Zinkernagel A.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4744-4755Google Scholar). Carbon flux through the Embden-Meyerhof pathway must be regulated if a glycolytic/gluconeogenic futile cycle is to be avoided. In view of the impact of csrA on glycogen biosynthesis and on the gluconeogenic enzymes, it was of interest to determine whether csrA affects the activities of the glycolytic enzymes. The specific activities of three of the bidirectional enzymes of this pathway, Pgi, Tpi, and Eno, were determined throughout the growth curve, as were the unidirectional, allosterically regulated glycolytic enzymes, PfkI, PfkII, PykA, and PykF. Fig. 2 shows that Pgi (A), Tpi (B), and Eno (C) activities were from 1.5- to 3-fold higher in the csrA+ strain relative to the csrA::kanR strain throughout the growth curve, indicating that these enzymes are under positive control of csrA. Comparison of Figure 1, Figure 2 also shows that the specific activities of the glycolytic enzymes were much higher than the gluconeogenic enzymes. This is consistent with the idea that levels of Embden-Meyerhof enzymes generally are present in significantly higher levels to meet the glycolytic requirements relative to the gluconeogenic requirements and indicates that csrA is a positive regulator of glycolysis. In E. coli, phosphofructokinase exists as two isozymes, PfkI and PfkII, which differ in their allosteric properties(1Fraenkel D.G. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 142-150Google Scholar, 2Kotlarz D. Garreau H. Buc H. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1975; 381: 257-268Google Scholar). The effect of csrA on each isozyme was examined, and the specific activity of the major isozyme, PfkI, was found to be significantly higher (up to 7.4-fold) in the csrA+ parent strain relative to the csrA::kanR mutant (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the activity of PfkII (Fig. 3B) was higher (1.3-4-fold) in the mutant than in the wild type strain. Therefore, these two glycolytic isozymes exhibited reciprocal regulation by csrA. In the wild type strain, PfkI represented approximately 80% of the total Pfk activity throughout the growth curve. In the csrA::kanR mutant, PfkII constituted approximately 30% of the total activity in mid-exponential phase and increased to 80% of the total Pfk activity as the culture entered stationary phase. Therefore, under conditions that were optimal for glycogen synthesis, i.e. in the csrA::kanR mutant during the early stationary phase of growth, PfkII was the predominant isozyme. Fig. 3(C and D) also shows the specific activities of the pyruvate kinase isozymes PykF and PykA in the csrA+ and the csrA::kanR strains. PykF activity was 4.3-9.4-fold higher in the wild type strain during the growth curve. However, PykA levels were similar in the two strains. Therefore, under the conditions of these studies, csrA appears to positively regulate the levels of PykF without altering the level of PykA. In order to test whether the changes observed in the levels of these enzymes are due to the effect of csrA on the expression of their structural genes, β-galactosidase activity expressed from chromosomally encoded pykF′-′lacZ or pykA′-′lacZ translational fusions was measured in isogenic csrA+ and csrA::kanR strains (Fig. 4). β-Galactosidase expressed from the pykF′-′lacZ fusion was up to 3.8-fold higher in the csrA+strain versus the csrA::kanR mutant (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, no appreciable difference was observed in the expression of the pykA′-′lacZ fusion in the relevant strains (Fig. 4B). Therefore, csrA determines PykF specific activity by enhancing pykF gene expression, rather than by altering PykF enzymatic activity. It was possible that the effects of the csrA::kanR mutation on the glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes could be a direct consequence of the inactivation of csrA or could result from polarity effects on genes distal to csrA. Therefore, the capacity of pCSR10 (a pUC19-derived plasmid that contains a 0.5-kilobase insert encoding only the csrA+ gene, (21Romeo T. Gong M. Liu M.Y. Brun-Zinkernagel A.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4744-4755Google Scholar)) to complement the effects of the csrA::kanR mutation on the levels of several enzymes was tested in the isogenic strains BW[pUC19] (csrA+), TR1-5BW[pUC19] (csrA::kanR), and TR1-5BW3414[pCSR10] (csrA-overexpressing). Table 2 summarizes the results of these experiments, which showed that the introduction of pCSR10 into the csrA::kanR strain caused the enzymes that were observed to be negatively regulated via csrA, i.e. Fbp, Pps, Pgm, and PfkII, to decrease below their (csrA+) wild type levels. The plasmid pCSR10 also complemented the effect of the csrA::kanR mutation on the levels of the enzymes that were observed to be positively regulated via csrA, Pgi, Tpi, PfkI, Eno, and PykF. However, overexpression of csrA from pCSR10 did not result in greater than wild type expression of these enzymes. It may be concluded from the results of this experiment that the inactivation of the csrA gene itself was responsible for the effects of the csrA::kanR mutation on gluconeogenic and glycolytic enzyme levels.TABLE II Open table in a new tab To determine whether the csrA::kanR mutation alters levels of glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes as an indirect consequence of the dramatic effect that it has on carbon flux into glycogen(21Romeo T. Gong M. Liu M.Y. Brun-Zinkernagel A.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4744-4755Google Scholar), the csrA::kanR mutation was transduced into G6MD3, a strain in which the glgBX and glgCAP operons have been deleted and which is incapable of synthesizing either glycogen or ADP-glucose. Levels of glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes were assayed in the resulting isogenic strains. Table 3 summarizes these experiments and shows that at 8 h the specific activities of Fbp, Pps, Pgm, and PfkII were 2.3-, 2.5-, 1.6-, and 2-fold higher in the csrA::kanR mutant than in the csrA+ strain. Specific activities of Pgi, PfkI, Tpi, Eno, PykF, and PykA were 2.1-, 6.0-, 1.4-, 2.0-, 2.8-, and 1.1-fold higher in the wild type strain as compared with the csrA::kanR mutant. These values are reasonably consistent with values from the strains that synthesize glycogen (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3) and show that the effects of csrA on glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzyme levels is not a secondary regulatory response to the enhanced carbon flux toward glycogen in the csrA::kanR mutant. Of course, these results do not exclude the possibility that intracellular metabolites other than those affected by glycogen synthesis may serve to indirectly mediate the effects of csrA on the levels on one or more of these enzymes.TABLE III Open table in a new tab The pentose phosphate pathway provides NADPH and biosynthetic intermediates for the cell, and two genes of the pathway, zwf, encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and gnd, encoding 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, have been shown to exhibit growth rate-regulated expression(28Rowley D.L. Pease A.J. Wolf Jr., R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4660-4667Google Scholar, 40Pease A.J. Wolf Jr., R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 115-122Google Scholar). The possibility that csrA regulates the expression of these two genes was tested by determining β-galactosidase specific activities expressed from the chromosomally encoded gnd′-′lacZ transcriptional and translational fusions of strains HB354 and HB582, respectively, and zwf′-′lacZ transcriptional and translational fusions of strains HB301[λDR52] and HB301[λDR104], respectively, in isogenic csrA+ and csrA::kanR strains throughout their growth curves (data not shown). The gnd′-′lacZ translational fusion exhibited very weak but reproducible positive regulation by csrA, i.e. slightly higher expression was observed in the csrA+ strain. No appreciable effect was observed for the zwf′-′lacZ transcriptional or translational fusions or the gnd′-′lacZ transcriptional fusion, indicating that at least under our experimental conditions, csrA is probably not a significant regulator of the pentose phosphate pathway. The above observations established that csrA is an important modulator of intermediary carbohydrate metabolism in E. coli. Further evidence for such a role was obtained by measuring the levels of five key intracellular metabolites in csrA+ and csrA::kanR strains. Table 4 and Table 5 show the effects of the csrA mutation on adenylates and energy charge, FBP and PEP. The metabolite levels and energy charge in the csrA+ strain were similar to those previously determined for E. coli(38Lowry O.H. Carter J. Ward J.B. Glaser L. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6511-6521Google Scholar, 42Dietzler D.N. Lais C.J. Leckie M.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 160: 14-24Google Scholar). On the other hand, the csrA::kanR mutant had lower levels of ATP and higher levels of AMP and ADP throughout the growth curve, resulting in a lower energy charge. The intracellular concentrations of FBP and PEP were both elevated in the csrA::kanR mutant. The decrease in energy charge in the mutant is consistent with a decrease in glycolysis and an increase in gluconeogenesis and glycogen synthesis and was predictable based upon the effect of the mutation on enzyme specific activities. The elevated level of PEP in the mutant reflects enhanced synthesis of this metabolite via Pps and Pck, as well as a decrease in its utilization by Pyk. The elevated FBP levels appear to result from a decrease in glycolytic flux following the Pfk reaction, and in particular, the effect of the csrA::kanR mutation on the expression of pykF is probably important.TABLE IV Open table in a new tab TABLE V Open table in a new tab The pleiotropic phenotype of a csrA::kanR insertion mutant originally indicated that the role of csrA in E. coli is broader than the control of glycogen synthesis (21Romeo T. Gong M. Liu M.Y. Brun-Zinkernagel A.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4744-4755Google Scholar). The primary goal of the current study was to explore the potential involvement of csrA in the regulation of intracellular carbon flux by observing the effects of disrupting or overexpressing csrA on the enzymes of central carbohydrate metabolism. The csrA gene has now been shown to affect several of these essential enzymes and thereby modulate intracellular carbon flux on a wide scale in E. coli. As summarized in Fig. 5, csrA exerts reciprocal effects on enzymes of glycolysis versus those of gluconeogenesis and glycogen biosynthesis. The studies on adenylate energy charge and metabolite levels presented here provide additional evidence of the role of csrA in determining central carbohydrate flux. Previous experiments had suggested that csrA negatively regulates gluconeogenesis(21Romeo T. Gong M. Liu M.Y. Brun-Zinkernagel A.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4744-4755Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the current study, which indicates that Fbp, Pps, and Pgm are negatively regulated by csrA. This study also shows that these activities are induced in the stationary phase, as was shown previously to be true for Pck by Goldie(43Goldie H. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 832-836Google Scholar). An earlier study had also indicated that Fbp activity is higher in stationary phase than in exponential phase in glucose-grown cells, although the difference was less than observed here, approximately 2-fold(31Fraenkel D.G. Horecker B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1965; 90: 837-842Google Scholar). In the current study, gluconeogenic enzyme activities were found to increase sharply in early stationary phase and thereafter decrease to pre-stationary phase levels. Since this response was not known previously for Fbp, the greater stationary phase induction of Fbp observed in our studies (7-10-fold) may be explained by the possibility that in the earlier experiment (31Fraenkel D.G. Horecker B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1965; 90: 837-842Google Scholar) the culture was harvested later in the stationary phase, after Fbp levels had dropped. The experiments of the current study were conducted under conditions which allow optimum glycogen synthesis in the early stationary phase. An important implication of this study is that under these conditions gluconeogenesis occurs during a fairly restricted period of time, coincident with glycogen biosynthesis, indicating that the primary role of gluconeogenesis in glucose-grown cells is to enhance glycogen synthesis. The growth-phase response documented here for the gluconeogenic enzymes should help the cell to conserve energy. A futile cycle of gluconeogenesis and glycolysis would be prevented or at least minimized in the exponential phase; the conversion of carbohydrate into endogenous glycogen should be favored as cells enter the stationary phase; and later in the stationary phase, during glycogenolysis, a futile cycle of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis would again be avoided. The decrease in the activities of the gluconeogenic enzymes which occurs later in stationary phase indicates that enzyme inactivation is also an important determinant of the gluconeogenic capacity of a cell. This may involve the specific inactivation of these enzymes later in the stationary phase or these enzymes may be labile throughout the growth cycle and their patterns of their activity in the growth curve reflect genetic expression. The induction profile of a pckA′-′lacZ transcriptional fusion (21Romeo T. Gong M. Liu M.Y. Brun-Zinkernagel A.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4744-4755Google Scholar, 43Goldie H. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 832-836Google Scholar) favors the latter alternative. In fact, the cell regulates the levels and activities of the gluconeogenic enzymes in a variety of ways, including (i) regulation at the level of transcript initiation via cAMP and the repressor of the PEP:fructose phosphotransferase system, FruR (43, 44 and references therein), (ii) allosteric control of Fbp by AMP and potential allosteric control of Pck by calcium ions and by ATP and PEP (10Fraenkel D.G. Pontremoli S. Horecker B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 114: 4-12Google Scholar, 45Goldie A.H. Sanwal B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1399-1405Google Scholar, 46Krebs A. Bridger W.A. Can. J. Biochem. 1980; 58: 309-318Google Scholar), and (iii) based upon extrapolation from studies on the mechanism of glgC regulation via CsrA(23Liu M.Y. Yang H. Romeo T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2663-2672Google Scholar), post-transcriptional control of mRNA stability may also be an important determinant of the gluconeogenic capacity of the cell. A surprising finding of these studies was that the isozymes which catalyze the phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase reactions are differentially affected by csrA. In both cases the individual isozymes have been shown to be allosteric(2Kotlarz D. Garreau H. Buc H. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1975; 381: 257-268Google Scholar, 3Waygood E.B. Mort J.S. Sanwal B.D.

They exhibit distinct and fairly complex regulation via several intracellular metabolites and are also expressed differently in response to oxygen levels and carbohydrate sources(11Farrish E.E. Baker II, H.V. Wolf Jr., R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 584-594Google Scholar, 12Hollywood N. Doelle H.W. Microbios. 1976; 17: 23-33Google Scholar, 13Reichelt J.L. Doelle H.W.

In the case of Pyk, the cellular levels of the of PykF were somewhat higher than those of PykA in the csrA+ strain, and under our experimental conditions PykF exhibited strong positive regulation by csrA, while PykA was not regulated. The PfkI isozyme was the predominant form in the csrA+ strain, as has been observed previously(2Kotlarz D. Garreau H. Buc H. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1975; 381: 257-268Google Scholar). PfkI is an essential enzyme in the cell, and the inactivation of the structural gene encoding PfkI (pfkA) alone has been shown to cause a growth defect on substrates which must be metabolized via this step of glycolysis. On the other hand, PfkII has generally been considered to be dispensable to the cell, since a pfkB mutant has no observable growth defect. However, it should be emphasized that the PfkII isozyme is capable of performing this step of glycolysis, and supressors of the pfkA mutation have been isolated and shown to result from the overexpression of pfkB(47Daldal F. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 285-305Google Scholar). The current studies show that the “minor” form of Pfk (PfkII) predominates when csrA has been disrupted. We may conclude that a pfkB+ cell has the capacity to produce more PfkII than normally is present and that the elevation of PfkII in the csrA::kanR strain is not a compensatory response to the decrease in PfkI. In viewing our findings in relation to those of others(2Kotlarz D. Garreau H. Buc H. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1975; 381: 257-268Google Scholar), it was noted that in addition to being positively regulated via csrA, the isozymes PfkI and PykF are related in other ways. (i) They are allosterically strongly regulated by glycolytic intermediates, PEP in the former case and FBP in the latter. The isozymes which are either under negative control or unregulated by csrA, PfkII and PykA, respectively, are allosterically regulated by other kinds of metabolites or show very weak effects of glycolytic intermediates. (ii) The expression of PfkI and PykF was also regulated according to the carbohydrate source used for growth, glucose being superior to pyruvate in both cases(2Kotlarz D. Garreau H. Buc H. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1975; 381: 257-268Google Scholar). The expression of the other two isozymes shows at best minimal effects of different carbon sources. Clearly, positive regulation of gene expression via csrA favors that glycolysis is responsive to intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism. Neither the pentose phosphate genes nor the glycolytic isozyme PykA, which can be allosterically activated by ribose phosphate, are substantially regulated via csrA. We have previously hypothesized that csrA is part of an adaptive response pathway(21Romeo T. Gong M. Liu M.Y. Brun-Zinkernagel A.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4744-4755Google Scholar), which carries the implicit assumption that the csrA::kanR mutation reflects a physiological condition under which this pathway is inactive. When csrA is inactivated glycolysis decreases, but it is still needed to provide ATP for the cell, while flux through the gluconeogenesis and glycogen biosynthesis pathways is increased. Thus, it is significant that when csrA is inactivated, PfkII becomes the major Pfk isozyme. PfkI is activated by ADP or other NDPs and is strongly inhibited by low concentrations of PEP(2Kotlarz D. Garreau H. Buc H. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1975; 381: 257-268Google Scholar). It has been shown that PEP levels can become quite high under gluconeogenic conditions (38Lowry O.H. Carter J. Ward J.B. Glaser L. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6511-6521Google Scholar) and in fact PEP was elevated in the csrA::kanR mutant. Thus, PfkI may not fulfill the demand for glycolysis under this condition. On the other hand, PfkII shows at best weak allosteric regulation ((1Fraenkel D.G. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 142-150Google Scholar) and references therein). Perhaps the preferential expression of PfkB avoids the synthesis of high levels of PfkI which would be required for glycolysis in the presence of elevated levels of PEP. Inactivation of csrA caused PykF to decrease while PykA was not affected, which should also alter the allosteric regulation of glycolysis. Although both of these Pyk isozymes are inhibited by ATP and succinyl-CoA, PykF is activated by FBP, while PykA is activated by nucleotide monophosphates, ribose phosphate, and other sugar phosphates (3Waygood E.B. Mort J.S. Sanwal B.D. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 277-282Google Scholar). Interestingly, the allosteric regulation of the committed step of glycogen synthesis, the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase reaction, responds to two of these metabolites, FBP serving as a strong activator and AMP as an inhibitor(20Preiss J. Romeo T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 47: 299-329Google Scholar). It is significant that PykF decreases when csrA is inactivated, since this should prevent FBP from activating the pyruvate kinase reaction of glycolysis. Thus, more FBP should accumulate if glycolytic flux is limited by the Pyk reaction and should activate ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase in a csrA mutant. This prediction appears to have been borne out, since FBP levels were significantly higher in the csrA::kanR mutant. Therefore, the effect of csrA on the allosteric regulation of the pyruvate kinase reaction apparently represents another way in which csrA negatively influences the regulation of glycogen biosynthesis and the inactivation of csrA favors glycogen synthesis. Clearly, the physiological parameters to which the csrA-mediated regulatory system responds still need to be elucidated. However, two potential physiological conditions can be excluded from being involved. Regulation via csrA does not involve differences in anaerobic versus aerobic conditions, since glycogen biosynthesis was shown previously to be strongly regulated via csrA under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (21Romeo T. Gong M. Liu M.Y. Brun-Zinkernagel A.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4744-4755Google Scholar) and since PfkI, which is positively regulated via csrA, and PykA, which is not regulated, are the representative isozymes which are expressed better under anaerobic conditions. It is also clear that csrA does not regulate gene expression in response to the growth phase, since the disruption of csrA did not alter the temporal regulation of the glg genes (21Romeo T. Gong M. Liu M.Y. Brun-Zinkernagel A.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4744-4755Google Scholar) or the gluconeogenic enzymes. An additional relevant observation is that csrA regulates some genes that are induced in the stationary phase and others that are expressed only in the exponential phase. The product of the csrA gene is capable of exerting either positive or negative effects on gene expression and is thus able to regulate gluconeogenesis and glycolysis in an opposite fashion. Studies are in progress to determine whether csrA regulates additional metabolic pathways. While the CsrA gene product is directly involved in the negative regulation of gene expression, a direct role in the positive regulation of genes (e.g. pykF) remains to be established. The complementation studies described herein present one kind of evidence suggesting that genetic activation via csrA may be intrinsically different from inhibition. When the csrA gene was overexpressed from the plasmid pCSR10, the negatively regulated genes were consistently found to be expressed at levels lower than in the csrA+ strain. On the other hand, none of the genes which are apparently subject to positive regulation by csrA were expressed at higher levels in the pCSR10-containing strain than in the wild type csrA+ strain. These and many other questions concerning the biological function and mechanism of csrA remain to be answered. We are grateful for the generous gifts of strains by the individuals listed in Table 1, especially Stefan Bledig (NSC Technologies), who provided strains prior to publication.

https://openalex.org/W2022413450,"Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) activity is regulated by several types of receptors directly coupled to distinct classes (i.e. Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12) of heterotrimeric (αβγ) GTP-binding proteins (G proteins), which, upon activation, modulate production of various second messengers (e.g. cAMP, cGMP, diacylglycerol, inositol trisphosphate, and Ca2+). Recently, four isoforms of the rat Na+/H+ exchanger were identified by molecular cloning. To examine their intrinsic responsiveness to G protein and second messenger stimulation, three of these isoforms, NHE-1, -2, and -3, were stably expressed in mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells devoid of endogenous NHE activity (AP-1 cells). Incubation of cells with either AlF4-, a general agonist of G proteins, or cholera toxin, a selective activator of Gαs that stimulates adenylate cyclase, accelerated the rates of amiloride-inhibitable 22Na+ influx mediated by NHE-1 and -2, whereas they inhibited that by NHE-3. Similarly, short term treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which mimics diacylglycerol activation of protein kinase C (PKC), or with agents (i.e. forskolin, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP, and isobutylmethylxanthine) that lead to activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) also stimulated transport by NHE-1 and NHE-2 but depressed that by NHE-3. The effects of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate were blocked by depleting cells of PKC or by inhibiting PKC using chelerythrine chloride, confirming a role for PKC in modulating NHE isoform activities. Likewise, the PKA antagonist, H-89, attenuated the effects of elevated cAMPi on NHE-1, -2, and -3, further demonstrating the regulation by PKA. Unlike cAMPi, elevation of cGMPi by treatment with dibutyryl-cGMP or 8-bromo-cGMP had no influence on NHE isoform activities, thereby excluding the possibility of a role for cGMP-dependent protein kinase in these cells.

https://openalex.org/W2076691124,"N-Ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) has been shown to be involved in numerous intracellular transport events. In an effort to understand the basic mechanism of NSF in vesicle-target membrane fusion events, we have examined the role that each of its three domains play in how NSF interacts with the SNAP•SNARE complex. Mutagenesis of the first ATP-binding domain (D1, amino acids 206-477) demonstrates that nucleotide binding by this domain is required for 20 S particle assembly. A second mutation, which permits ATP binding but not hydrolysis, yields a protein that can form 20 S particle but fails to mediate its disassembly. Similar mutations of the second ATP-binding domain (D2, amino acids 478-744) result in trimeric molecules that behave like wild type NSF. Domain rearrangement mutants were used to further probe the functional role of each domain. The amino-terminal domain (N, amino acids 1-205) is absolutely required for binding of NSF to the SNAP•SNARE complex, because the truncated mutant, D1D2, is unable to form 20 S particle. When tested as an isolated recombinant protein, the N domain is not sufficient for binding to the SNAP•SNARE complex, but when adjacent to the D1 domain or in a trimeric molecule, the N domain does mediate binding to the SNAP•SNARE complex. Monomeric N-D1 and trimeric N-D2 could both participate in particle formation. Only the N-D1 mutant was able to facilitate MgATP-dependent release from the SNAP•SNARE complex. These data demonstrate that NSF binding to the SNAP•SNARE complex is mediated by the N domain and that both ATP binding and hydrolysis by the D1 domain are essential for 20 S particle dynamics. The intramolecular interactions outlined suggest a mechanism by which NSF may use ATP hydrolysis to facilitate the vesicle fusion process.

When tested as an isolated recombinant protein, the N domain is not sufficient for binding to the SNAP•SNARE complex, but when adjacent to the D1 domain or in a trimeric molecule, the N domain does mediate binding to the SNAP•SNARE complex. Monomeric N-D1 and trimeric N-D2 could both participate in particle formation. Only the N-D1 mutant was able to facilitate MgATP-dependent release from the SNAP•SNARE complex. These data demonstrate that NSF binding to the SNAP•SNARE complex is mediated by the N domain and that both ATP binding and hydrolysis by the D1 domain are essential for 20 S particle dynamics. The intramolecular interactions outlined suggest a mechanism by which NSF may use ATP hydrolysis to facilitate the vesicle fusion process."

In primary neutrophils from patients with CML, the major novel tyrosine-phosphorylated protein is CRKL, an SH2-SH3-SH3 linker protein which has an overall homology of 60% to CRK, the human homologue of the v-crk oncogene product. Anti-CRKL immunoprecipitates from CML cells, but not normal cells, were found to contain p210BCR/ABL and c-ABL. Several other phosphoproteins were also detected in anti-CRKL immunoprecipitates, one of which has been identified as paxillin, a 68-kDa focal adhesion protein which we have previously shown to be phosphorylated by p210BCR/ABL. Using GST-CRKL fusion proteins, the SH3 domains of CRKL were found to bind c-ABL and p210BCR/ABL, while the SH2 domain of CRKL bound to paxillin, suggesting that CRKL could physically link p210BCR/ABL to paxillin. Paxillin contains three tyrosines in Tyr-X-X-Pro (Y-X-X-P) motifs consistent with amino acid sequences predicted to be optimal for binding to the CRKL-SH2 domain (at positions Tyr-31, Tyr-118, and Tyr-181). Each of these tyrosine residues was mutated to a phenylalanine residue, and in vitro binding assays indicated that paxillin tyrosines at positions 31 and 118, but not 181, are likely to be involved in CRKL-SH2 binding. These results suggest that the p210BCR/ABL oncogene may be physically linked to the focal adhesion-associated protein paxillin in hematopoietic cells by CRKL. This interaction could contribute to the known adhesive defects of CML cells.

In cell lines and primary cells, p210BCR/ABL translocates to the cytoskeleton (1McWhirter J. Wang J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and causes the tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins, including the SH2-SH3-SH3 adaptor protein CRKL(2ten Hoeve J.

In contrast, in the early (stable) phase of CML, there are only a few proteins which either interact with BCR/ABL or are phosphorylated by BCR/ABL(3Oda T. Heaney C. Hagopian J.R. Okuda K.

The CRKL protein has an overall homology of 60% to c-CRK, the human homologue of the v-crk oncogene(12ten Hoeve J. Morris C. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2469-2474PubMed Google Scholar). v-crk is the oncogene in the CT10 avian retrovirus and has a deletion of the C-terminal SH3 domain(13Feller S.M. Ren R.B. Hanafusa H. Baltimore D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 14Mayer B.J. Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 32: 272-275Crossref Scopus (509) Google Scholar). v-Crk, c-CRK, and CRKL each have one SH2 domain, and two SH3 domains, without other known functional motifs (13Feller S.M. Ren R.B. Hanafusa H. Baltimore D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The functions of c-CRK and CRKL in normal signaling are unknown, although recent studies have linked c-CRK to signaling in normal T-cells(15Sawasdikosol S. Ravichandran K.S. Lee K.K. Chang J.-H. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2893-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Since several proteins in v-Crk-transformed cells are heavily phosphorylated on tyrosyl residues, it has been suggested that v-Crk and c-Crk may serve as regulatory subunits of a tyrosine kinase (16Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3581-3589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, c-Abl has been identified as a possible Crk-associated tyrosine kinase(17Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). c-Abl binds in vitro to the first Crk SH3 domain and phosphorylates Crk on tyrosine 221. The phosphorylation on Crk (Tyr-221) creates a binding site for the Crk SH2 domain, possibly inhibiting its binding to other proteins(13Feller S.M. Ren R.B. Hanafusa H. Baltimore D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 17Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). It is not known if Crk and Abl interact in vivo. Interestingly, despite the structural similarities of c-CRK and CRKL and the apparent interaction of v-Crk and c-Abl, our preliminary studies indicated that CRKL is phosphorylated in CML cells, while c-CRK is not. In an effort to determine if CRKL functions to link p210BCR/ABLto other cellular proteins, we looked for proteins which coprecipitated with CRKL in p210BCR/ABL-containing cell lines. A 68-kDa protein precipitating with CRKL was identified as paxillin, a focal adhesion protein we have previously shown to be phosphorylated by p210BCR/ABL(9Salgia R. Li J.L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kansas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M. Ernst T. Tantravahi R. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The interaction between p210BCR/ABL, CRKL, and paxillin could contribute to the pathogenesis of CML. The 32Dcl3 cell line was obtained from Dr. Joel Greenberger (University of Pittsburgh) and cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum and 15% WEHI-condition media (as a source of IL-3). 32Dcl3 expressing p210BCR/ABL clones were generated using previously described methods(18Matulonis U. Salgia R. Okuda K. Druker B. Griffin J. Exp. Hematol. 1993; 21: 1460-1466PubMed Google Scholar). Several clones were used for the experiments, and a typical clone, 32D.p210BCR/ABL.26, is shown in the data section. K562 cells were obtained from the ATCC and were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum. Human neutrophils were isolated from volunteer donors or subjects with CML after obtaining appropriate informed consent on approved protocols(19Griffin J.D. Spertini O. Ernst T.J. Belvin M.P. Levine H.B. Kanakura Y. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 576-584PubMed Google Scholar). 32Dcl3 cells were starved and stimulated with IL-3 (10 ng/ml, murine, 10 min) as described previously(18Matulonis U. Salgia R. Okuda K. Druker B. Griffin J. Exp. Hematol. 1993; 21: 1460-1466PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, isolated neutrophils were unstimulated or stimulated with GM-CSF (10 ng/ml, human, 10 min)(19Griffin J.D. Spertini O. Ernst T.J. Belvin M.P. Levine H.B. Kanakura Y. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 576-584PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were then prepared(4Druker B. Okuda K. Matulonis U. Salgia R. Roberts T. Griffin J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitations or immunoblots were performed with anti-CRKL rabbit polyclonal sera (Santa Cruz or CH16 (20ten Hoeve J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Protein samples were separated under reducing conditions by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE, 6%-12% gradient gel) and electrophoretically transferred and immunoblotted as described(9Salgia R. Li J.L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kansas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M. Ernst T. Tantravahi R. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins containing full-length CRKL and GST-CRKL-SH2-SH3(N) have been described previously(20ten Hoeve J. Kaartinen V. Fioretos T. Haataja L. Voncken J.W. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2563-2567PubMed Google Scholar). GST-CRKL-SH2 was generated by inserting a 360-base pair TaqI-RsaI fragment of a CRKL cDNA into pGEX-2T. GST-CRKL-SH3(N)-SH3(C) was obtained by cloning a blunt-ended 630-base pair BsmI fragment into pGEX-3X. Precipitations were performed with 1-10 μg of fusion protein on glutathione beads using the lysate from 5-10 × 106 cells as described(9Salgia R. Li J.L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kansas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M. Ernst T. Tantravahi R. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Individual tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations of human paxillin at amino acid positions 31, 118, and 181 were performed via a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy(21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The final constructs were entirely sequenced. The full-length wild type human paxillin (amino acids 1-527) and tyrosine mutant paxillin were expressed in the vector pGEX-2TK (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and paxillin fusion proteins were produced. For the CRKL-SH2 fusion protein binding experiment, 1 μg of wild type or mutant GST-paxillin fusion protein on glutathione beads was phosphorylated for 30 min at 25°C in vitro with 2 units of v-Abl kinase (Oncogene Science) in 100 μl of kinase reaction buffer (containing 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM MnCl2, 0.1 mM ATP in 20 mM HEPES solution, pH 7.2). After the kinase reaction, the v-Abl and ATP were removed by washing the beads with lysis buffer at least five times. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the paxillin fusion protein was evaluated by an anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot. The tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin-GST protein was cleaved with thrombin(22Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). The thrombin cleavage product of the paxillin fusion protein was checked on an SDS-PAGE gel with Coomassie staining for amount of protein cleaved and on an immunoblot with anti-paxillin antibody to confirm the amount of cleaved product to be used for binding assay. An equivalent amount of thrombin-cleaved paxillin protein (approximately 0.3 μg) was used in precipitations with GST-CRKL-SH2 (1 μg) protein. Finally, the precipitated samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to Immobilon-polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with anti-paxillin antibody. We used immunoblotting to investigate the expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of CRKL and c-CRK in myeloid cell lines. p39CRKL was detected in untransformed murine 32Dcl3 cells, 32Dcl3 cells transformed with BCR/ABL, and the Philadelphia chromosome-positive human cell line K562 (Fig. 1). p39CRKL could readily be immunoprecipitated with an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10) from p210BCR/ABL-containing cells, but not from untransformed 32Dcl3 cells. Similarly, both CRK-I and CRK-II (the two forms of c-CRK) were found to be expressed in 32Dcl3 and K562 cells. However there was no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of c-CRK in normal or BCR/ABL-transformed cell lines (Fig. 2). The reverse experiment, using an anti-CRKL or anti-CRK immunoprecipitation and phosphotyrosine immunoblotting yielded the same results (data not shown). Since CRKL has the predicted structure of an adaptor protein, we looked for CRKL-associated proteins by immunoprecipitating CRKL with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (CH-16) followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (Fig. 3). Several phosphotyrosine-containing proteins coprecipitated with CRKL in 32Dp210BCR/ABL and K562 cells, but not in untransformed 32Dcl3 cells (Fig. 3). The major tyrosine phosphoproteins observed after SDS-PAGE had estimated molecular masses of 210, 140, 120, 68, 52, and 39 kDa. The 68-kDa protein was consistently observed in anti-CRKL immunoprecipitates in p210BCR/ABL-containing cell lines. Since we have recently identified paxillin as a 68-kDa protein which is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in p210BCR/ABL-containing cell lines(9Salgia R. Li J.L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kansas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M. Ernst T. Tantravahi R. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), we asked if the 68-kDa protein which coprecipitates with anti-CRKL was paxillin. Anti-CRKL immune complexes were separated on SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotted with anti-paxillin antibody. These immune complexes contain paxillin in p210BCR/ABL-containing cells, but not in untransformed myeloid cell lines (Fig. 4). The reverse experiment, paxillin immunoprecipitation followed by anti-CRKL immunoblotting, gave identical results. Interestingly, we did not detect coprecipitation of c-CRK and paxillin in these same cells (Fig. 2), suggesting that this interaction is unique to CRKL in BCR/ABL-transformed cells. The possible association of CRKL and paxillin was also investigated in freshly isolated, primary neutrophil samples from seven patients with CML and compared with neutrophils from four normal subjects (Fig. 5). Again, anti-CRKL immune complexes contained paxillin in all CML stable phase neutrophil samples tested, but not when neutrophils from normal individuals were examined. Since the neutrophils from the normal subjects were isolated in a quiescent state, we also stimulated normal neutrophils with the potent neutrophil-activating cytokine GM-CSF (10 ng/ml for 10 min) prior to repeating the immunoprecipitation experiments. GM-CSF stimulation did not induce CRKL and paxillin coprecipitation in normal neutrophils (Fig. 5). In contrast, paxillin coprecipitated with CRKL both before and after GM-CSF stimulation of CML neutrophils. After stimulation with GM-CSF, CRKL coimmunoprecipitated with both the slower and faster migrating forms of paxillin (phosphorylated forms of paxillin have slower migration(9Salgia R. Li J.L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kansas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M. Ernst T. Tantravahi R. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar)). These results suggest that the interaction of CRKL and paxillin in myeloid cells is restricted to cells expressing an active BCR/ABL protein. To partially map the domains of CRKL involved in binding to paxillin in BCR/ABL-containing cells, GST-CRKL fusion proteins were used for precipitation experiments. GST-CRKL (full length), GST-CRKL-SH2, and GST-CRKL-SH2-(N)SH3 effectively precipitated paxillin from cells transformed by BCR/ABL, while GST-CRKL-(N)SH3-(C)SH3 precipitated only a very small amount of paxillin (lower panel, Fig. 6). In contrast, the same blot stripped and reprobed with anti-ABL indicated that fusion proteins containing one or more SH3 domains of CRKL can precipitate c-ABL and BCR/ABL, whereas GST-CRKL-SH2 did not. These results suggest that the CRKL-SH2 domain can interact with paxillin while one or both of the SH3 domains interact with BCR/ABL, and the very minor binding of the GST-CRKL-SH3 domains to paxillin could be indirect through c-ABL or BCR/ABL. SH2 domains are known to bind to specific motifs containing a phosphotyrosine residue. However, the optimum binding motif for CRKL has not yet been determined. Since the structures of the c-CRK and CRKL-SH2 domains are quite similar, we examined paxillin for possible c-CRK-SH2 binding motifs, based on the predicted optimum sequence, Y-X-X-P(23Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Three such motifs were identified, at amino acid positions (for the tyrosine residue) 31, 118, and 181. Tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants of paxillin were constructed at each residue, and binding of these paxillin mutants to GST-CRKL-SH2 was examined in vitro after the mutant paxillin proteins were phosphorylated with v-Abl. Mutations of either Tyr-31 or Tyr-118, but not Tyr-181, of paxillin significantly reduced binding of GST-CRKL-SH2 (Fig. 7). The lack of binding of GST-CRKL-SH2 to the mutant paxillin proteins was more than would be expected if the two motifs around Tyr-31 and Tyr-118 contributed equally and independently to binding. It is possible that one of the mutations has an effect that alters the structure of the actual binding site. At the present time, the explanation for this phenomenon is unknown and is being explored with additional mutants. BCR/ABL is a unique tyrosine kinase oncogene which transforms hematopoietic cells in vivo and in vitro, but does not effectively transform many nonhematopoietic cell lines. The chimeric oncoprotein p210BCR/ABL produced from the Philadelphia chromosome is known to bind the actin cytoskeleton through a conserved C-terminal domain in ABL, and this interaction is believed to be important for transformation(1McWhirter J. Wang J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Van Etten R. Jackson P. Baltimore D. Sanders M. Matsudaira P. Janmey P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 325-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 25McWhirter J. Wang J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1533-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that once p210BCR/ABL translocates to the cytoskeleton, it recruits signaling proteins which result in aberrant regulation of adhesion, proliferation, and viability(26Renshaw M.W. McWhirter J.R. Wang J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1286-1293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the potentially most interesting proteins that interact with p210BCR/ABL is CRKL. Previous studies from three different laboratories have identified CRKL as a major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in primary cells or cell lines derived from patients with stable phase CML(2ten Hoeve J. Arlinghaus R.B. Guo J.Q. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1731-1736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Oda T. Heaney C. Hagopian J.R. Okuda K. Griffin J.D. Druker B.J. J. Biol.

Blood. 1994; 84: 2912-2918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CRKL gene was initially identified independently in the process of generating a long range physical map of the region between the BCR gene and the centromere of chromosome 22q11(12ten Hoeve J. Morris C. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2469-2474PubMed Google Scholar). An exon of an unknown gene was found to encode a possible SH2 domain, and the complete cDNA sequence revealed a novel crk-like gene, termed CRKL. The CRKL gene product has about 60% amino acid identity to c-Crk. CRKL, like c-CRK, has an SH2 domain at the N terminus of the protein, and two tandem SH3 domains at the C terminus, with no other known functional domains(13Feller S.M. Ren R.B. Hanafusa H. Baltimore D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The structural similarity between the SH2 and SH3 domains of CRKL and c-CRK suggests that they could interact with an overlapping set of proteins(27Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1465-1473PubMed Google Scholar). However, in vivo, c-CRK and CRKL may or may not have related functions, and it is largely unknown even if they are in the same subcellular compartment(s). The finding that CRKL is a prominent substrate for the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase and coprecipitates with p210BCR/ABL, suggested that it could function to link BCR/ABL to other cellular signaling proteins. At present, however, very few binding partners are known for either c-CRK or CRKL. Interestingly, Feller et al.(17Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) have recently showed that both v-Crk and c-Crk could bind in vitro to c-Abl. This interaction was shown to occur at least in part through the SH3 domains of v-Crk or c-Crk, and possible proline-rich Crk-SH3 binding sites have been identified in c-Abl. In this study, we looked for CRKL-associated proteins, in addition to p210BCR/ABL and c-ABL, in cells transformed by BCR/ABL and found that CRKL coprecipitated with several additional cellular proteins. In the current study, one of these proteins has been identified as the focal adhesion protein paxillin. In vitro binding studies indicated that CRKL bound to paxillin predominantly through the CRKL-SH2 domain, but bound to p210BCR/ABL through the CRKL-SH3 domain, the later finding confirming earlier studies(20ten Hoeve J. Kaartinen V. Fioretos T. Haataja L. Voncken J.W. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2563-2567PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that CRKL may indeed function as an adaptor protein, linking p210BCR/ABL to paxillin in CML cells, but not in untransformed cells. In support of this hypothesis, we have shown that a small amount of paxillin coprecipitates with p210BCR/ABL and c-ABL in lysates from CML cell lines, but not from untransformed cell lines. These immune complexes also contain CRKL. The interaction of p210BCR/ABL with paxillin is not unanticipated. Previous studies have shown that p210BCR/ABL binds to actin in transformed fibroblasts(1McWhirter J. Wang J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we have recently shown that p210BCR/ABL in hematopoietic cells is localized to punctate cytoskeletal structures that contain paxillin and vinculin, two proteins characteristic of focal adhesions(28Salgia R. Brunkhorst B. Pisick E. Li J.-L. Lo S.H. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1149-1155PubMed Google Scholar). Paxillin was originally identified by a monoclonal antibody produced by Glenney and Zokas (29Glenney J. Zokas L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) during a blind screen for potential substrates of the v-Src tyrosine kinase. A cDNA encoding human paxillin has recently been cloned by our group and predicts the presence of several protein-protein interaction domains in this protein(9Salgia R. Li J.L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kansas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M. Ernst T. Tantravahi R. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of paxillin is composed of four tandem LIM domains. A number of transcription factors such as rhombotin-I and -II have LIM domains(30Sanchez-Garcia I. Rabbitts T.H. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1993; 4: 349-358PubMed Google Scholar), and at least two other cytoskeletal proteins also have LIM domains, zyxin, and cysteine-rich protein. These latter two proteins have been shown to bind to each other through their LIM domains, suggesting that LIM domains are capable of mediating protein interactions(31Schmeichel K. Beckerle M. Cell. 1994; 79: 211-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Paxillin also contains a proline-rich domain which is a potential binding site for SH3-containing proteins. The binding sites in paxillin for talin, vinculin, and p125FAK have been partially localized. Paxillin has also been shown to bind to the SH2 domain of v-Crk in vitro, and recent studies indicate that phosphopeptides with pY-X-X-P (where pY indicates the phosphorylated tyrosine residue) motifs can bind to CRK-SH2 domains(23Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 32Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M.

Human paxillin has three of these motifs at tyrosine positions 31, 118, and 181. Schaller and Parsons (33Schaller M. Parsons J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) have recently shown that tyrosines at positions 31 and 118 of paxillin may be important in binding the Crk-SH2 domain. We investigated the binding of CRKL-SH2 to paxillin in vitro using wild type and tyrosine mutants of paxillin. Each of the tyrosines with the Y-X-X-P motif (at tyrosines position 31, 118, and 181) in paxillin was mutated to phenylalanine for in vitro binding assays. Decreased binding of CRKL-SH2 to paxillin was observed with mutant tyrosines at positions 31 and 118, but not 181. It is not clear why the data suggest that both tyrosine 31 and 118 need to be intact for binding. These two tyrosines could both be important in binding either a single CRKL protein or two different CRKL proteins. Overall, CRKL could link BCR/ABL and paxillin and thereby contribute to the adhesion defects of CML progenitor cells(34Gordon M.Y. Dowding C.R. Riley G.P. Goldman J.M. Greaves M.F. Nature. 1987; 328: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 35Verfaillie C.M. McCarthy J.B. McGlave P.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1232-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The mechanism of transformation of avian cells by v-crk may have some parallels in the transformation of hematopoietic cells by BCR/ABL. v-Crk activates a cellular tyrosine kinase, now believed to be c-Abl(17Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 36Ren R. Ye Z.S. Baltimore D. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). v-Crk has lost the C-terminal SH3 domain through deletion and with it, a potentially important phosphorylation site at Tyr-221 of c-CRK. It has been suggested that Tyr-221 is phosphorylated in resting, nontransformed cells and forms a binding site for the c-CRK-SH2 domain(13Feller S.M. Ren R.B. Hanafusa H. Baltimore D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This intramolecular interaction would be predicted to make the SH2 domain unavailable for binding to other cellular phosphoproteins and could also potentially interfere with the availability of one or both of the c-CRK-SH3 domains. In contrast, the SH2 domain of v-Crk may constitutively be available for binding, while the SH3 domain interacts with one or more proline-rich domains in c-ABL, linking c-ABL to other cellular proteins. In BCR/ABL-transformed cells, CRKL coprecipitates with p210BCR/ABL, and as shown here, binds p210BCR/ABL through one or both CRKL-SH3 domains. Since anti-CRKL immune complexes contain a number of proteins in addition to p210BCR/ABL and CRKL, the SH2 domain of CRKL appears to be available for binding. In this study, we have identified one of these binding proteins as paxillin. Interestingly, we did not detect tyrosine phosphorylation of either CRKL or CRK in resting, untransformed, myeloid cell lines, and it is not yet known if the CRKL-SH2 domain will bind through an intramolecular interaction with the tyrosine residue comparable with Tyr-221 of c-CRK (Tyr-207 of CRKL). Also of interest was the finding that CRK-I and -II were not detectably tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells transformed by BCR/ABL. Interestingly, paxillin is also known to be prominently phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in cells transformed by v-crk(23Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and it is quite possible, based on the current studies, that paxillin is linked to c-Abl by v-Crk, functioning as an adaptor protein in v-crk-transformed cells. Although most of the studies reported here were performed in cell lines transformed by BCR/ABL, the coprecipitation of CRKL and paxillin was confirmed by studying primary neutrophils from patients with CML stable phase. Paxillin and CRKL were found to coimmunoprecipitate in lysates from CML neutrophils but not from normal neutrophils. This is noteworthy since there are only a few proteins in primary CML cells which contain more phosphotyrosine than in normal cells, and CRKL is one of the two most prominent of such proteins(3Oda T. Heaney C. Hagopian J.R. Okuda K. Griffin J.D. Druker B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22925-22928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies will be necessary to determine if these interactions lead to aberrant adhesive properties or other biological effects. The available data suggest a model in which p210BCR/ABL in the cytoskeleton binds to the CRKL-SH3 domain. The SH2 domain of CRKL is free to interact with other proteins such as paxillin. The tyrosines at positions 31 and 118 of paxillin appear to be important in binding to the CRKL-SH2 domain. This trimeric complex may be able to transduce signals which are normally regulated by either integrin or growth factor receptor activation. One testable hypothesis is that p210BCR/ABL mimics or interferes with the signaling normally induced by integrin activation. There are multiple potential biological consequences of such interactions, including altering adhesive properties mediated by integrins, and it has been shown previously that CML cells have characteristically decreased adhesion to fibronectin(34Gordon M.Y. Dowding C.R. Riley G.P. Goldman J.M. Greaves M.F. Nature. 1987; 328: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 35Verfaillie C.M. McCarthy J.B. McGlave P.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1232-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Also, interfering with integrin signaling could have effects on cell viability. For example, in some hematopoietic cells, it has been shown that adherence to fibronectin leads to increased apoptosis(37Sugahara H. Kanakura Y. Furitsu T. Ishihara K. Oritani K. Ikeda H. Kitayama H. Ishikawa J. Hashimoto K. Kanayama Y. Matsuzawa Y. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1757-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Interference with the appropriate signaling pathway could therefore lead to resistance to apoptosis, another property of CML cells. We suggest that the interaction of p210BCR/ABL with paxillin, through CRKL, could contribute to these signaling abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W2042532487,"Although pathogenic keratin mutations have been well characterized in inherited epidermal disorders, analogous defects in keratins expressed in non-epidermal epithelia have yet to be described. White sponge nevus (WSN) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder of non-cornifying squamous epithelial differentiation that presents clinically as bilateral white, soft, thick plaques of the oral mucosa. Less frequently the mucous membranes of the nose, esophagus, genitalia and rectum are involved. Histopathological features, including epithelial thickening, parakeratosis, extensive vacuolization of the suprabasal keratinocytes and compact aggregates of keratin intermediate filaments (KIF) in the upper spinous layers, resemble those found in epidermal disorders due to keratin defects. We analysed a multigenerational family with WSN and found cosegregation of the disease with the keratin gene cluster on chromosome 17. We identified a missense mutation in one allele of keratin 13 that leads to proline substitution for a conserved leucine. The mutation occurred within the conserved 1A region of the helical rod domain, which is critical for KIF stability and is the site of most pathogenic keratin mutations. This mutation enlarges the spectrum of keratins with disease-causing defects to include mucosally expressed keratin 13, and extends the known keratin diseases to disorders of non-cornifying stratified squamous epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W2090187544,"Chloroaromatics, a major class of industrial pollutants, may be oxidatively metabolized to chlorocatechols by soil and water microorganisms that have evolved catabolic activities toward these xenobiotics. We show here that 4-chlorocatechol can be further transformed by enzymes of the ubiquitous 3-oxoadipate pathway. However, whereas chloromuconate cycloisomerases catalyze the dechlorination of 3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate to form cis-dienelactone, muconate cycloisomerases catalyze a novel reaction, i.e. the dechlorination and concomitant decarboxylation to form 4-methylenebut-2-en-4-olide (protoanemonin), an ordinarily plant-derived antibiotic that is toxic to microorganisms. Chloroaromatics, a major class of industrial pollutants, may be oxidatively metabolized to chlorocatechols by soil and water microorganisms that have evolved catabolic activities toward these xenobiotics. We show here that 4-chlorocatechol can be further transformed by enzymes of the ubiquitous 3-oxoadipate pathway. However, whereas chloromuconate cycloisomerases catalyze the dechlorination of 3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate to form cis-dienelactone, muconate cycloisomerases catalyze a novel reaction, i.e. the dechlorination and concomitant decarboxylation to form 4-methylenebut-2-en-4-olide (protoanemonin), an ordinarily plant-derived antibiotic that is toxic to microorganisms. Industrially produced halogenated aromatic compounds constitute a major class of environmental pollutants. Whereas some compounds are recalcitrant to degradation and accumulate in the environment, others disappear rapidly. Microorganisms exhibit an exceptional range of metabolic versatility, evolutionary potential and opportunism, which enables them to colonize a variety of habitats too hostile for higher organisms and to metabolize, and thereby grow, at the expense of a wide spectrum of noxious compounds, including some that are highly toxic. The aerobic degradation of a wide range of aromatic compounds involves their successive activation and modification such that they are channeled toward one of a few key dihydroxylated intermediates such as catechol, gentisate, or protocatechuate, which are the substrates for cleavage of the aromatic ring. In the case of the haloaromatics, although halide elimination during an early step in the catabolic sequence has been documented in a few instances(1Apajalahti J.H.A. Salkinoja-Salonen M.S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 675-681Google Scholar, 2Scholten J.D. Chang K.-H. Babbitt P.C. Charest H. Sylvestre M. Dunaway-Mariano D. Science. 1991; 253: 182-185Google Scholar, 3Sander P. Wittich R.-M.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 279-290Google Scholar), the major degradative route involves conversion to corresponding halocatechols, intradiol (ortho) cleavage of the aromatic ring, and halide elimination during a subsequent reaction ((5Reineke W. Knackmuss H.-J. Ann. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 263-287Google Scholar); Fig. 1). This so-called “modified” ortho-cleavage pathway is thought to essentially parallel the classical 3-oxoadipate pathway, and enzymes of the classical 3-oxoadipate pathway have been assumed to carry out reactions identical to those of their counterparts in the modified ortho pathway, albeit with much lower activities (6Dorn E. Knackmuss H.-J. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 73-84Google Scholar, 7Dorn E. Knackmuss H.-J. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 85-94Google Scholar, 8Schmidt E. Knackmuss H.-J. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 339-347Google Scholar). In both pathways, catechols are ortho-cleaved by (chloro-) catechol 1,2-dioxygenases, to form the corresponding cis,cis-muconates, which are then cycloisomerized by muconate cycloisomerase or chloromuconate cycloisomerase(6Dorn E. Knackmuss H.-J. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 73-84Google Scholar, 7Dorn E. Knackmuss H.-J. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 85-94Google Scholar, 8Schmidt E. Knackmuss H.-J. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 339-347Google Scholar). In analogy to muconolactone (4-carboxymethylbut-2-en-4-olide) as product of cis,cis-muconate cycloisomerization, halosubstituted muconolactones were believed to be intermediates of cycloisomerization of halosubstituted cis,cis-muconates, and spontaneous dehalogenation of those intermediates was postulated to give rise to 4-carboxymethylenebut-2-en-4-olides (dienelactones; (8Schmidt E. Knackmuss H.-J. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 339-347Google Scholar)). Those are subsequently hydrolyzed to maleylacetate by dienelactone hydrolase(8Schmidt E. Knackmuss H.-J. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 339-347Google Scholar), followed by the enzymatic reduction of maleylacetate to 3-oxoadipate, the first common intermediate of the classical and the modified ortho-cleavage pathways ((9Reineke W. Gibson D.T. Microbial Degradation of Organic Compounds. Marcel Dekker, New York1984: 319-360Google Scholar); Fig. 1B). Based on the models of Ngai and Kallen (10Ngai K.-L. Kallen R.G.

Soc. 1987; 109: 5514-5519Google Scholar) of syn addition to a cis double bond of muconate proceeding via a carbanionic intermediate, Schlömann et al.(12Schlömann M. Fischer P. Schmidt E. Knackmuss H.-J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5119-5129Google Scholar) suggested that the cycloisomerization reaction of 3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate is completed by the elimination of chloride rather than the protonation of the carbanionic intermediate, excluding 4-chloromuconolactone as an intermediate. An analogous elimination of chloride from the carbanion is not possible during cycloisomerization of 2-chloro-cis,cis-muconate. Recently, it has been shown that 2- and 5-chloromuconolactone were formed by muconate cycloisomerase(13Vollmer M.D. Fischer P. Knackmuss H.-J. Schlömann M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4366-4375Google Scholar), proving that this class of enzymes is not able to cause dechlorination during conversion of 2-chloro-cis,cis-muconate and that dechlorination by chloromuconate cycloisomerases is actually an enzyme-catalyzed process. We report here, that both muconate and chloromuconate cycloisomerases cause dehalogenation during conversion of 3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate but that different reactions were catalyzed.

Cells were grown in M9 medium supplemented with the indicated carbon source (usually 5 mM) and incubated at 30°C on a rotary shaker at 140 rpm in baffled Erlenmeyer flasks. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at the end of the logarithmic growth phase, resuspended in the appropriate buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, supplemented with 2 mM MnSO4 for analysis or purification of muconate cycloisomerase) and passed once through a French pressure cell (Aminco) operating at 18,000 p.s.i. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The clear supernatant is referred to as the cell extract. Catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.1) was measured by following the formation of cis,cis-muconate at 260 nm by a modification of the method of Dorn and Knackmuss(6Dorn E. Knackmuss H.-J. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 73-84Google Scholar). The cuvettes initially contained 33 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, and an appropriate amount of enzyme. After a 5-min incubation, the reaction was started by the addition of catechol or 4-chlorocatechol to a final concentration of 0.2 mM. Muconate cycloisomerase (EC 5.5.1.1) was measured following the consumption of cis,cis-muconate at 260 nm by a modification of the method of Sistrom and Stanier(22Sistrom W.R. Stainer R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 210: 821-836Google Scholar). The cuvettes initially contained 50 mM, 2 mM MnSO4, pH 8, 80 μMcis,cis-muconate, and an appropriate amount of enzyme. Transformation of 3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate was followed by HPLC. 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMES4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. high performance liquid chromatography 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. Chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase, chloromuconate cycloisomerase (EC 5.1.1.7) and dienelactone hydrolase (EC 3.1.1.45) were determined according to published methods(4Fetzner S. Müller R. Lingens F. J.

The protein concentration was estimated as described by Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Enzyme purifications were performed on a Pharmacia Biotech Inc. fast protein liquid chromatography system. For the purification of muconate cycloisomerase from Pseudomonas sp. B13, the cells were grown with benzoate, and the cell extract was incubated at 60°C for 5 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant fluid was applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 anion-exchange column. The column was operated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Proteins were eluted with 10 ml of Tris (50 mM, pH 7.5, supplemented with 2 mM MnSO4), followed by 5 ml of the same buffer containing 70 mM NaCl and a 5-ml linear gradient of NaCl (70-140 mM). Active fractions were precipitated with 70% ammonium sulfate, loaded onto a phenyl-Superose HR 5/5 (hydrophobic interaction) column, and the enzyme activity was eluted with a 35-ml linear gradient of ammonium sulfate (0.7-0.0 M). The active fractions were pooled, adjusted to 70% with ammonium sulfate, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 200 μl of the same buffer, and loaded onto a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (gel filtration). Proteins were eluted with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, supplemented with 2 mM MnSO4. The active fractions were applied to a second anion-exchange chromatography as described above. The catechol 1,2-dioxygenase type I from B13 was purified from the same cell-free extract by a similar procedure, but the heat treatment and the last anion-exchange step were avoided. For the first anion-exchange chromatography, a 20-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0-500 mM) was applied. Muconate cycloisomerase form P. putida strain RW10 was purified by similar procedures. In order to obtain catechol 1,2-dioxygenase I or II preparations free of the responsible isoenzyme and free of any cycloisomerizing activities, those proteins were partially purified. The ultracentrifugated cell free extract was applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column, and the proteins were eluted with 5 ml of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, followed by a 20-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0-500 mM) of the same buffer. This procedure allows for the separation of the enzymes and isoenzymes of the classical and modified ortho-pathway. SDS electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli(24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Low molecular mass standards (phosphorylase b, 97.4 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 66.2 kDa; ovalbumin, 45 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 31 kDa; soybean trypsin inhibitor, 21.5 kDa; and lysozyme, 14.4 kDa) were purchased from Bio-Rad. Proteins were stained with an aqueous solution containing 1% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and 7% (v/v) acetic acid and destained with an aqueous solution containing 10% (v/v) acetic acid and 10% (v/v) isopropanol. Substrates and products were quantified by using a Beckman System Gold HPLC equipped with SC columns (125 × 4.6 mm) filled with 5-mm particles of Lichrospher 100 RP8 (Bischoff). An aqueous solution of 15% (v/v) methanol and 0.1% (v/v) H3PO4 in Milli Q (Millipore) water was used as the mobile phase (flow rate, 1 ml/min). Usually, samples of 20 μl were analyzed. The column effluent was monitored simultaneously at 210 and 270 nm by use of a diode array detector, and the scans between 210 and 300 nm of the significant peaks were stored by the system. Typical net retention volumes (ml) and characteristic absorption maxima (between 240 and 300 nm) were as follows: maleylacetate, 1 ml; trans-dienelactone, 3 ml, λmax = 274 nm; protoanemonin, 6 ml, λmax = 260 nm; cis-dienelactone, 6.6 ml, λmax = 275 nm; 3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate, 9.5 ml, λmax = 257 nm; 4-chlorocatechol, 23 ml, λmax = 285 nm. The reaction mixture initially contained, in a final volume of 230 ml, 20 mM Tris, pH 8, 13 units of purified catechol 1,2-dioxygenase type I, and 60 μmol of 4-chlorocatechol. At this pH, catechol 1,2-dioxygenase type I exhibited maximal activity, and 3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate, the assumed reaction product, was reported to be stable. The reaction was carried out at 25°C under continuous agitation, and the progress of the reaction was followed by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 260 nm. After 2 h, the absorbance at 260 nm remained constant, and HPLC analysis confirmed the complete consumption of 4-chlorocatechol. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 6.5 by the addition of 60 ml of 500 mM MES/NaOH buffer, pH 6.5, and the reaction was initiated by addition of MnSO4 (2 mM) and purified muconate cycloisomerase (7 units). After 2.5 h protoanemonin was the major metabolite detected by HPLC (>98%) and was extracted twice with 250 ml of diethyl ether. About 4 mg of a pale yellow oil were obtained after careful evaporation of the ether. UV spectra were either recorded using a Beckman DU 70 spectrophotometer or were available from the diode array analysis of the HPLC effluent. In order to estimate the molecular extinction coefficient of protoanemonin, the solution obtained after complete enzymatic conversion of 4-chlorocatechol (using purified catechol 1,2-dioxygenase and muconate cycloisomerase) was diluted 10 times with water, and the spectrum was recorded between 220 and 320 nm. A solution containing the same amount of enzymes and buffers but without substrate was used as background. For high resolution gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, the sample was analyzed by using a Carlo Erba/mega series gas chromatograph equipped with a 30-m DB1 column. The gas chromatograph was linked to a Kratos MS 50 mass spectrometer. Helium was used as the carrier gas, and a potential of 70 eV was used for electron ionization. Dynamic high resolution MS of the molecular ion and the major fragment ions was performed using perfluorokerosene as internal reference. High resolution 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a CXP 300 spectrometer (Bruker) using tetramethylsilane as internal standard and deuterated methanol as solvent. cis,cis-Muconate was prepared in vitro from 0.2 mM catechol using partially purified catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas sp. B13. This solution was used to follow the muconate cycloisomerase activity during the purification procedure. The syntheses of cis-dienelactone ((E)-4-carboxymethylenebut-2-en-4-olide), trans-dienelactone ((Z)-4-carboxymethylenebut-2-en-4-olide) and 3-chlorocatechol have been described previously(25Reineke W. Knackmuss H.-J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1984; 47: 395-402Google Scholar, 26Schreiber A. Hellwig M. Dorn E. Reineke W. Knackmuss H.-J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1980; 39: 58-67Google Scholar). 4-Chlorocatechol was purchased from Aldrich. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from Fluka AG, Merck AG, and Aldrich Chemie GmbH. According to the currently accepted scheme for the metabolism of chlorinated catechols, 4-chlorocatechol will be converted by catechol 1,2-dioxygenase type I and muconate cycloisomerase to cis-dienelactone with reasonable activities(6Dorn E. Knackmuss H.-J. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 73-84Google Scholar, 7Dorn E. Knackmuss H.-J. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 85-94Google Scholar, 8Schmidt E. Knackmuss H.-J. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 339-347Google Scholar). Theoretically, due to low activity of dienelactone hydrolase (8Schmidt E. Knackmuss H.-J. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 339-347Google Scholar) maleylacetate will be the final metabolite when cell extracts of benzoate-grown B13 are incubated with 4-chlorocatechol. However, we observed the formation of a new absorption maximum at 260 nm when the conversion of 4-chlorocatechol (100 μM) by such extracts was followed spectrophotometrically. Those spectroscopic changes neither fit with the formation of maleylacetate (λmax = 243 nm; (27Evans W.C. Smith B.S.W. Moss P. Fernley H.N. Biochem. J. 1971; 122: 509-517Google Scholar)), nor of cis- or trans-dienelactone (λmax = 275 nm). Analysis of the reaction mixture by HPLC revealed the formation of a single metabolite that did not co-chromatograph with any of those compounds described to be formed during chlorocatechol metabolism via an ortho-cleavage pathway(6Dorn E. Knackmuss H.-J. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 73-84Google Scholar, 7Dorn E. Knackmuss H.-J. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 85-94Google Scholar, 8Schmidt E. Knackmuss H.-J. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 339-347Google Scholar, 9Reineke W. Gibson D.T. Microbial Degradation of Organic Compounds. Marcel Dekker, New York1984: 319-360Google Scholar, 13Vollmer M.D. Fischer P. Knackmuss H.-J. Schlömann M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4366-4375Google Scholar, 28Schmidt E. Remberg G. Knackmuss H.-J. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 331-337Google Scholar). In order to analyze whether this new metabolite was formed from 4-chlorocatechol in a single catalytic step or in a coupled reaction and whether enzymes of the 3-oxoadipate pathway were responsible for its formation, both the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase type I and the muconate cycloisomerase from Pseudomonas sp. B13 were purified to homogeneity. Specific activity of catechol 1,2-dioxygenase type I (29 units/mg of protein) agreed well with literature data (20 units/mg of protein; (6Dorn E. Knackmuss H.-J. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 73-84Google Scholar)). Muconate cycloisomerase was purified 91-fold, giving a preparation with a specific activity of 137 units/mg of protein. The protein showed a single band in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis corresponding to a molecular mass of 40 kDa. Spectrophotometric analysis of 4-chlorocatechol (100 μM) turnover by purified muconate cycloisomerase of B13 revealed an increase in absorption at 260 nm as predicted for 3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate formation(7Dorn E. Knackmuss H.-J. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 85-94Google Scholar). Turnover of 4-chlorocatechol by catechol 1,2-dioxygenase type II gave the same spectroscopic changes. In both cases, increase in absorption of 1.2 ± 0.05 is indicative for quantitative 3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate formation. In both cases, the quantitative consumption of 4-chlorocatechol was confirmed by HPLC analysis. The appearance of two products was observed. One of those (retention volume, 6.6 ml) co-chromatographed with authentic cis-dienelactone and was reported to be spontaneously formed from 3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate under the acidic conditions used for HPLC analysis(28Schmidt E. Remberg G. Knackmuss H.-J. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 331-337Google Scholar, 29Pieken W.A. Kozarich J.W. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 3029-3035Google Scholar). Consequently, catechol 1,2-dioxygenase types I and II carry out the same reaction with 4-chlorocatechol as substrate, forming 3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate (retention volume, 9.5 ml) as the product. When a 3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate containing reaction mixture was incubated with muconate cycloisomerase (2 mM Mn2+ was added to stabilize muconate cycloisomerase), practically no spectroscopic changes were observed. Monitoring of the enzyme-catalyzed turnover by HPLC, however, clearly showed the disappearance of 3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate and the concomitant production of the new compound, which was shown to be formed from 4-chlorocatechol by cell extract of benzoate-grown B13 cells. Because this compound was found to be unstable at basic pH (Table 1), muconate cycloisomerase-catalyzed preparative transformation of 3-chloro-cis, cis-muconate was carried out under slightly acidic conditions. The product formed from 3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate by purified Pseudomonas sp. B13 muconate cycloisomerase was isolated on a micropreparative scale as described under “Materials and Methods.” The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 2) shows four olefinic protons, centered at three different carbon atoms. A geminal coupling of 2.8 Hz between H-3 and H-4, a vicinal coupling of 5.6 Hz between H-1 and H-2, as well as long range couplings between H-1 and H-4 (1.9 Hz) and H-1 and H-3 (0.7 Hz) were observed. High resolution gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy verified the composition C5H4O2: m/e, 96.0222 (M+, 100%, base peak); m/e, 68.0264 (M+ - CO, 46%); m/e, 54.0115 (M+ - C2H2O, 41%); m/e, 42.0103 (M+ - C3H2O, 69%). Those results confirm the identification as 4-methylenebut-2-en-4-olide (protoanemonin). UV-visible spectroscopic data for protoanemonin isolated from Anemona pulsatilla have been reported by Shaw (30Shaw E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1946; 68: 2510-2513Google Scholar) (λmax = 260 nm; ɛ260 nm = 14,000 M-1 cm-1). Enzyme-catalyzed transformation of 4-chlorocatechol into protoanemonin resulted in an increase of absorbance slightly higher than expected from those data, indicative for quantitative formation of this product (λmax = 259.5 nm; ɛ = 15,100 M-1 cm-1). In order to analyze whether or not the formation of protoanemonin from 3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate is a unique characteristic of the muconate cycloisomerase from Pseudomonas sp. B13, the corresponding enzyme from salicylate-grown cells from P. putida RW10 was purified. 3-Chloro-cis,cis-muconate was prepared in vitro from 4-chlorocatechol by partially purified (only by anion-exchange chromatography) catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas sp. B13. Following enzymatic conversion, proteins were eliminated by passage of the reaction mixture through a 10-kDa cut-off pore filter. Bioconversion of 3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate was carried out in a final volume of 1 ml with 20 milliunits of P. putida RW10 muconate cycloisomerase under the conditions described for the preparative production of protoanemonin with Pseudomonas sp. B13 enzymes. After 30 min, the reaction was completed by stoichiometric production of protoanemonin as judged by HPLC analysis. Formation of protoanemonin (always greater than 70% of the theoretical yield) was also observed when cell extracts from cultures of different bacteria producing enzymes of the 3-oxoadipate pathway, i.e. benzoate-grown Pseudomonas sp. B13, P. putida KT2442 and Sphingomonas sp. RW1, and salicylate-grown P. putida RW10, were incubated with 10.2 mM 4-chlorocatechol. This is indicative of a general reaction mechanism for muconate cycloisomerizing enzymes. The specific activity for protoanemonin production by cell extracts was always >50 units/g protein, and further metabolism was negligible (<1 unit/g of protein), indicating that protoanemonin is probably a nonmetabolizable, dead-end product of the classical 3-oxoadipate pathway. In contrast to the situation with bacteria induced for type I ortho-pathway enzymes (3-oxoadipate pathway) enzymes only, no formation of protoanemonin from 4-chlorocatechol was detected when an extract of a 3-chlorobenzoate-grown culture of strain B13, i.e. an extract containing type II-modified ortho-pathway enzymes, was used. In this case, maleylacetate resulting from the concerted action of chloromuconate cycloisomerase and dienelactone hydrolase, was the only product observed. It should be noted at this juncture that 3-chlorobenzoate-grown B13 cells are induced for both the modified and the classical pathways and that the cell extract contained both muconate cycloisomerase and chloromuconate cycloisomerase. These two enzymes were partially purified from the extract by anion-exchange chromatography; individually they catalyzed the expected reactions, i.e. protoanemonin formation by muconate cycloisomerase and cis-dienelactone formation by chloromuconate cycloisomerase, but combined fractions quantitatively transformed 3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate into cis-dienelactone, indicative for the reported high activity of chloromuconate cycloisomerase with this substrate(8Schmidt E. Knackmuss H.-J. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 339-347Google Scholar). When benzoate-grown cells of Pseudomonas sp. B13 or P. putida RW10 (A600 nm = 0.8) were incubated with 1 mM 4-chlorocatechol, they completely consumed the substrate in less than 1 h. The optical density remained constant throughout the incubation period of 6 h, however, there was a drastic decrease (one order of magnitude) in the number of colony-forming units in the course of the experiment. This effect was not observed when catechol was added. The toxicity of 4-chlorocatechol toward Pseudomonas sp. B13 cells has already been reported(26Schreiber A. Hellwig M. Dorn E. Reineke W. Knackmuss H.-J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1980; 39: 58-67Google Scholar). In order to analyze whether this toxic effect is due to 4-chlorocatechol itself or to protoanemonin formed during the incubation, washed cells of Pseudomonas sp. B13 grown on acetate, benzoate, or 3-chlorobenzoate were incubated with 4-chlorocatechol. A significant decrease in colony-forming units was observed only for benzoate-grown cells (Fig. 2). Whereas benzoate- and 3-chlorobenzoate-grown cells showed a rapid turnover of 4-chlorocatechol in less than 15 min, acetate-grown cells consumed the compound within 4 h. 3-Chlorobenzoate- as well as acetate-grown cells metabolized 4-chlorocatechol without any detectable accumulation of intermediates. Accumulation of protoanemonin was, however, observed in the supernatant of benzoate-grown cells. The amount of protoanemonin produced accumulated up to 30% of that expected for the stoichiometric transformation of 4-chlorocatechol. We therefore conclude that 4-chlorocatechol itself has no major toxic effect but that cell death is due too protoanemonin. In order to study the effect of protoanemonin on various xenobiotic-degrading bacteria, we synthesized this compound from 4-chlorocatechol in a coupled reaction (catechol 1,2-dioxygenase type I and muconate cycloisomerase) catalyzed by cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas sp. B13 bacteria grown on benzoate. Pure preparations of protoanemonin were obtained after extraction with diethyl ether with a yield higher than 90%. In all cases, protoanemonin inhibited the growth of microorganisms, concentrations between 15 and 150 ppm being bacteriostatic (Table 3). Since several studies have shown that muconate cycloisomerase and chloromuconate cycloisomerase are evolutionarly closely related(31Aldrich T.L. Frantz B. Gill J.F. Kilbane J.J. Chakrabarty A.M. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 185-195Google Scholar, 32Frantz B. Chakrabarty A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4460-4464Google Scholar, 33Ghosal D. You I.S. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1988; 211: 13-120Google Scholar, 34Ghosal D. You I.S. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 83: 225-232Google Scholar), a common reaction mechanism for both types of enzymes has been assumed(12Schlömann M. Fischer P. Schmidt E. Knackmuss H.-J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5119-5129Google Scholar). The stereochemistry of the reaction catalyzed by the muconate cycloisomerase of P. putida with muconate as substrate has been elucidated (Fig. 3A) and a carbanion has been postulated as the mechanistic intermediate(10Ngai K.-L. Kallen R.G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5231-5236Google Scholar) . The currently accepted mechanism for the enzymatic reaction involves the formation of a metal-stabilized enol/enolate intermediate followed by a vinylogous E2 reaction (1,4-elimination)(35Gerlt J.A. Gassman P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 5928-5934Google Scholar, 36Mazur P. Pieken W.A. Budihas S.R. Williams S.E. Wong S. Kozarich J.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1961-1970Google Scholar) . Although this reaction model explains the dechlorination of 4-chloromuconolactone catalyzed by chloromuconate cycloisomerase (Fig. 3B), because of the double bond linking the carboxylate anion, the proposed intermediate does not explain the formation of protoanemonin in the reaction catalyzed by muconate cycloisomerase. Other workers have postulated that 4-chloromuconolactone is formed by protonation of the corresponding carbanion as intermediate and have assumed that this compound is chemically unstable, such that cis-dienelactone is generated spontaneously by anti-elimination of hydrogen chloride or chloride from the carbanion (6Dorn E. Knackmuss H.-J. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 73-84Google Scholar) in a nonenzymatic collateral reaction (Fig. 3C, part 2). However, if this were the case, the product of the reaction with 3-chloromuconate should be always cis-dienelactone, independent of the type of enzyme catalyzing the reaction. This reasoning, together with our new findings, has led us to propose 4-chloromuconolactone as the intermediate from which decarboxylation and dechlorination occur concomitantly in a single reaction catalyzed by muconate cycloisomerase (Fig. 3C, part 1). For the reaction catalyzed by chloromuconate cycloisomerase, an active site base must be postulated, which catalyzes fast elimination of the solvent-derived C-5 proton and the halide, thus generating cis-dienelactone (Fig. 3C, part 2). Despite their high degree of homology, it is evident that muconate cycloisomerase and chloromuconate cycloisomerase are not merely isoenzymes with distinct substrate specificities. Different mechanisms were observed not only with 3- but also with 2-chloro-cis,cis-muconate(13Vollmer M.D. Fischer P. Knackmuss H.-J. Schlömann M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4366-4375Google Scholar), indicating different active site structures. It is interesting to speculate that evolution of the chloromuconate cycloisomerase active site structure may have been selected by the need to prevent formation of the antibiotic protoanemonin. The three-dimensional structure of both muconate cycloisomerase from P. putida(37Goldman A. Ollis D.L. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 143-153Google Scholar) and of chloromuconate cycloisomerase from Alcaligenes eutrophus JMP 134 (38Hoier H. Schlömann M. Hammer A. Glusjer J.P. Carrell H.L. Goldman A. Stezowski J.J. Heinemann U. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 75-84Google Scholar) have now been elucidated, and conformational differences in the active site as well as differences in the polarity and size of the channel leading to the active site were reported. Site-directed mutagenesis will give insights in amino acids responsible for variation in substrate specificity and transformation mechanisms. Protoanemonin has been known since 1945 as an active constituent of plants of the Ranunculaceae family, which is antibiotically active against a wide spectrum of microorganisms(39Seegal B.C. Holden M. Science. 1945; 101: 413-415Google Scholar). We report here on its bacterial formation from 4-chlorocatechol, a central intermediate of the catabolism of chloroaromatic compounds, by enzmes of the wide-spread 3-oxoadipate pathway. Protoanemonin formation was observed in vitro and in vivo, resulting in cell death. As being released from the cells, it may subsequently affect the entire ecosystem in which it is produced. Formation of protoanemonin has to be taken into consideration when microorganisms harboring incomplete catabolic pathways are confronted with chloroaromatics. Accordingly, the inhibitory effect of chlorobenzoates on chlorobiphenyl metabolism and degradation by coinoculation of chlorobenzoate degraders has been observed. Havel and Reineke (40Havel J. Reineke W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1992; 38: 129-134Google Scholar) attributed the inhibition of mineralization of polychlorinated biphenyls by laboratory-selected microorganisms in soil microcosms to an unknown toxic metabolite produced from 4-chlorobenzoate (the end-product of 4-chlorobiphenyl metabolism by the biphenyl degraders used in this study) by the native microflora present in their soil slurries. The positive effect on such survival achieved by co-inoculation with chlorobenzoate degraders (41Hickey W.J. Searles D.B. Focht D.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 1194-1200Google Scholar, 42Sondossi M. Sylvestre M. Ahmad D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 485-495Google Scholar) is consistent with this hypothesis. Microcosm experiments performed in our laboratories have shown protoanemonin formation by the natural microflora to be responsible for the poor survival of polychlorinated biphenyls-cometabolizing bacteria in environmental settings(44Pieper D.H. Blasco R. Wittich R.-M. Megharaj M. Fock U. Prucha M. Seege M. Hofer B. Timmis K.N. Aubert J.P. Martin D.M.V. The Year of Louis Pasteur International Symposia: Microbes, Environment, Biotechnology. Tahiti, French Polynesia, May 8-12, 1995. Institut Louis Malard é, Papeete, Tahiti1995: 85-89Google Scholar). We assume that the microbial formation of protoanemonin will occur not only in the presence of chlorinated aromatic pollutants but also during the catabolism of fluoroaromatics. The cycloisomerization product of 3-fluoro-cis,cis-muconate was reported to be transformed by enollactone hydrolase of P. putida strain A 3.12 predominantly into a new compound that was tentatively identified by its UV-spectroscopic properties as protoanemonin(43Schlömann, M., 1988, Die verschiedenen Typen der Dienlacton-Hydrolase und ihre Rolle beim bakteriellen Abbau von 4-Fluorobenzout. Ph.D. thesis, University of Stuttgart, Germany.Google Scholar). If this result is subsequently confirmed, it seems that protoanemonin can be formed by two completely different enzyme reactions, namely those carried out by muconate cycloisomerase and by enollactone hydrolase, according to the nature of the halosubstituent of cis,cis-muconate. We thank Manfred Nimtz and Victor Wray for performing gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy and NMR analysis, Michael Schlömann for fruitful discussions, and Dave McKay for critical reading of the manuscript."

INTRODUCTIONThe multiple physiological actions, including cell growth and differentiation of the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) 1The abbreviations used are: IGFinsulin-like growth factorFBSfetal bovine serumMTT3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. are mediated by the IGF-I receptor. While the IGF-I receptor and the structurally related insulin receptor are members of the type II receptor tyrosine kinase family, their in vivo biological functions are quite separate. Both the IGF-I and insulin receptors are heterotetrameric proteins composed of two extracellular α-subunits and two membrane-spanning β-subunits linked by disulfide bonds(1Ullrich A. Bell J.R.

Cell. 1985; 40: 747-758Google Scholar). Sequences found in the α-subunits of each receptor are important for determining ligand specificity. The amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal portions of the α subunit of the insulin receptor are critical for high affinity insulin binding, while the cysteine-rich domain of the IGF-I receptor determines high affinity IGF-I binding(4Kjeldsen T. Andersen A.S. Wiberg F.C. Rasmussen J.S. Schaffer L. Balschmidt P. Moller K.B. Moller N.P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4404-4408Google Scholar, 5Schumacher R. Mosthaf L.

Likewise, the β-subunits contain a number of structurally distinct domains including the extracellular, transmembrane, juxtamembrane, tyrosine kinase, and carboxyl-terminal regions. Binding of ligand to the α-subunit activates the tyrosine kinase activity of the β-subunit resulting in autophosphorylation on distinct tyrosine residues. The triple tyrosine cluster within the kinase domain (1131, 1135, and 1136 tyrosines in the IGF-I receptor and the equivalent residues in the insulin receptor; numbering system of Ullrich et al.(2Ullrich A.

EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2503-2513Google Scholar)) is the earliest and major site of autophosphorylation. Phosphorylation of these three tyrosine residues is necessary for activation of the kinase toward other substrates(7White M.F. Shoelson S.E. Keutmann H. Kahn C.R. J. Biol.

When the triple tyrosine cluster is substituted by phenylalanine residues, the receptor loses all ligand-induced biological actions(9Gronborg M. Wulff B.S. Rasmussen J.S. Kjeldsen T. Gammeltoft S. J.

Single substitutions of tyrosine 1131 or 1135 have relatively small effects on receptor and endogenous substrate phosphorylation or on cell proliferation(14Li S. Ferber A. Miura M. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32558-32564Google Scholar, 15Stannard B. Blakesley V. Kato H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). In contrast, substitution of tyrosine 1136 apparently has an inhibitory effect on those functions(14Li S. Ferber A. Miura M. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32558-32564Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated, at least in the case of the insulin receptor, that in intact cells, bis phosphorylation of the kinase domain at Tyr-1158 and either Tyr-1162 or Tyr-1163 comprises 80% of phosphorylated receptors(7White M.F. Shoelson S.E. Keutmann H. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2969-2980Google Scholar, 16Tavare J.M. O'Brien R.M. Siddle K. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 783-788Google Scholar, 17Tornqvist H.E.

Thus, a study involving the substitution of combinations of double tyrosines may be more instructive. To further characterize the role of these tyrosines in IGF-I receptor function, we have performed substitutions of combinations of two tyrosines in the kinase domain of the IGF-I receptor. We transfected NIH-3T3 cells to study receptor autophosphorylation and post-receptor signaling pathways as well as biological functions of the receptor including cell growth and tumorigenicity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsRestriction endonucleases were purchased from New England Biolabs, Boehringer Mannheim, and Life Technologies, Inc.

Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Google Scholar). Mutation of the human IGF-I receptor cDNA at amino acid residues 1131, 1135, and 1136 (numbering system is that of Ullrich et al.(2Ullrich A. Gray A. Tam A.W. Yang-Feng T. Tsubokawa M. Collins C. Henzel W. Le Bon T. Kathuria S. Chen E. Jacobs S. Francke U. Ramachandran J. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2503-2513Google Scholar)) was performed by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis using the Double Take Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and a pBluescript II plasmid containing an EcoRI-BamHI fragment of the human IGF-I receptor (previously described by Kato et al.(19Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Google Scholar)). The tyrosines at positions 1131, 1135, and 1136 were designated as being the first(1Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E.Y. Herrera R. Petruzzeli L.M. Dull T.J. Gray A. Coussens L. Liao Y.-C. Tsubokawa M. Mason A. Seeburg P.H. Grunfeld C. Rosen O.M. Ramachandran J.

Cell. 1985; 40: 747-758Google Scholar) in the triple tyrosine cluster. The following double tyrosine mutations were generated: DYF12 (tyrosines 1131 and 1135 mutated to phenylalanines 1131 and 1135), DYF13 (tyrosines 1131 and 1136 mutated to phenylalanines) and DYF23 (tyrosines 1135 and 1136 mutated to phenylalanines). The sequence of the bridging primer was 5′-GCCGCCACCGCGGTGGAGCTCCAATTCGCC-3′ (the SacI site used for mutagenesis is underlined), and the sequence of the extension primer was 5′-AGCTCCACCGCGGTGGCGGCCGCT-3′. The sequence of the mutagenic primer to generate DYF12 was 5′-CTTTCCGGTAAAAGTCTGTTTCGAAGATATCTCGCGT-3′. The sequence of the mutagenic primer to generate DYF13 was 5′-CTCCTTTCCGGAAATAGTCTGTCTCAAAGATATCTC-3′. The sequence of the mutagenic primer to generate DYF23 was 5′-TGCCTCCTTTCCGGAAAAAGTCTGTCTCATA-3′. In the mutagenic primers, codons mutated from tyrosine to phenylalanine are underlined. Nucleotide sequences mutated to generate a restriction enzyme site are presented in bold type. A new SfuI site was introduced in the cDNA for DYF12. A new AccIII site was introduced in the cDNA for both DYF13 and DYF23. The cDNA sequences of all the mutations were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. The mutated cDNAs in pBluescript II were excised with SalI and NotI and cloned into a bovine papilloma virus-derived mammalian expression vector (pBPV; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) that had been linearized with XhoI and NotI.Cell Culture and TransfectionAll NIH-3T3 cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM glutamine in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37°C. NIH-3T3 cells were cotransfected with 20 μg of wild-type or mutant expression vector or insert-less pBPV plus 1 μg of pMCINeo (Clontech) in Lipofectamine reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Selection was carried out as described previously(19Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Google Scholar). Clones overexpressing IGF-I receptors were selected based on results of IGF-I binding assays as described previously(19Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Google Scholar). Stably transfected cells were maintained in the media described above supplemented with 500 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.). Serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and antibiotics was used in phosphorylation assays of the receptor and cellular substrates.Receptor AutophosphorylationConfluent cells in 100-mm plates were serum-starved overnight and then incubated either with or without IGF-I (100 ng/ml) for 1 min at 37°C. The cells were washed rapidly with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in the presence of 50 nM Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 4 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mM sodium fluoride. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein (up to 40 μg) were reduced by β-mercaptoethanol and fractionated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond, ECL, Amersham). The amount of IGF-I receptor present was determined by immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-IGF-I receptor β-subunit antibody (Siddle 1-2) at a 1:500 dilution at 4°C overnight; this antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin (1:5000 dilution). The blots were then developed with the ECL system. Based on these immunoblots, equal amounts of receptors were fractionated by SDS-PAGE as described above. Blots for tyrosine phosphorylation were immunoblotted with monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10) (1:1000 dilution) and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin (1:5000 dilution) using the ECL system. The level of phosphorylation of the β-subunits was quantitated by digitalizing the signal from the x-ray film and analyzing the signal using NIH image version 1.55 software and calculated according to receptor density assessed using the Siddle 1-2 antibody(15Stannard B. Blakesley V. Kato H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar).IRS-1 and Shc ImmunoprecipitationConfluent cells in 100-mm plates were serum-starved overnight and then incubated either with or without IGF-I (100 ng/ml) at 37°C. Cleared cell lysates were prepared as described above. For immunoprecipitation, 600 μg of protein were incubated either with 3 μg of anti-Shc antibody or 3 μg of anti-IRS-1 antibody at 4°C overnight. Then, 50 μl of 10% protein A-Sepharose in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7, was added and incubated at 4°C for 3 h. The precipitates were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 0.4 mM Na3VO4, 0.4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton, 1% Nonident P-40) and fractionated by 9% SDS-PAGE. Resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine RC20H antibody (1:2500 dilution) for phosphorylation studies or with anti-Grb-2 (1:1000 dilution) or anti-PTP1D (1:1000 dilution) for coimmunoprecipitation studies. Anti-Grb-2 and anti-PTP1D were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin (1:5000 dilution).MTT Cellular Proliferation Assay3 × 103 cells were plated in each well of 96 multi-well plates and allowed to recover overnight in DMEM plus 10% FBS. Thereafter, cell growth was continued in either 1% FBS or 1% FBS supplemented with 100 ng/ml IGF-I for 7 days. Media were replenished at 72 h of growth. The cells were processed at varying time points as described previously(20Denizot F. Lang R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89: 271-277Google Scholar), and the cellular number was calculated daily.Tumorigenicity AssayThe ability of various cell lines to form tumors was determined by injecting 1 × 107 cells subcutaneously in the lower dorsal region of nude mice. Mice were housed in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. After 4 weeks, mice were examined weekly to monitor tumor formation, and measurements were taken by using a caliber. Tumor volume was calculated by the following formula: length × width2/2 (V = a × b2/2).StatisticsStatistical significance between groups was tested using the Student's t test.RESULTSExpression of Wild-type and Mutant ReceptorsTwo separate clones overexpressing each mutant or wild-type IGF-I receptor were used in this study. DYF12 designates substitution of the tyrosine residues with phenylalanine at positions 1131 and 1135. Substitution of tyrosine residues with phenylalanine at positions 1131 and 1136 is designated as DYF13, and substitution of tyrosine residues at positions 1135 and 1136 is designated as DYF23. WT43 and WT50 are clones overexpressing wild-type human IGF-I receptor(15Stannard B. Blakesley V. Kato H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). pNeo is a clone cotransfected with a neomycin-resistant plasmid and the pBPV vector (15Stannard B. Blakesley V. Kato H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). All clones overexpressing IGF-I receptor had similar numbers of cell surface IGF-I receptors as determined by Scatchard analysis (Table 1)(21Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-673Google Scholar).TABLE I Open table in a new tab Receptor AutophosphorylationOne of the first events after IGF-I binding to the IGF-I receptor is the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues of the β-subunit of the receptor. The triple tyrosine cluster in the tyrosine kinase domain is considered to be the major autophosphorylation site of the IGF-I receptor(10Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 40-50Google Scholar). To study the autophosphorylation capability of the mutant receptors, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml IGF-I for 1 min at 37°C. As shown in Fig. 1, IGF-I-induced receptor autophosphorylation is dramatic in cells overexpressing wild-type receptors. In contrast, cells overexpressing a similar number of receptors in which tyrosines 1131 and 1135 have been substituted (DYF12 clones 4 and 10) have undetectable levels of autophosphorylation. Cells overexpressing receptors with tyrosines 1131 and 1136 substitutions (DYF13 clones 33 and 42) or 1135 and 1136 (DYF23 clones 1 and 46) demonstrated clonal variation. Clones 42 (DYF 13) and 46 (DYF 23) showed no significant reduction in autophosphorylation compared with cells expressing wild-type receptors. However, clones 33 (DYF 13) and 1 (DYF 23) demonstrated less than a 50% reduction in autophosphorylation levels. These results suggest a differential role for these three tyrosines in the IGF-I-induced autophosphorylation of the receptor. The presence of either tyrosine 1131 or 1135 is critically important to have detectable levels of autophosphorylation, whereas the presence of tyrosine 1136 is not critical for autophosphorylation.Phosphorylation of Endogenous SubstratesThe two major signal transduction pathways following IGF-I receptor stimulation characterized thus far are those mediated by IRS-1 and Shc. We therefore studied the activation of IRS-1 and Shc pathways by IGF-I in wild-type and double tyrosine mutants. To evaluate IRS-1 pathway activation, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml IGF-I for 1 min at 37°C, and IRS-1 immunoprecipitates were assayed for tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Grb2 and PTP1D association. Stripping and reblotting the membranes with a polyclonal anti-IRS-1 antibody confirmed that similar amounts of IRS-1 protein were immunoprecipitated in all samples (data not shown). A typical result of these experiments is presented in Fig. 2. Panel A shows IRS-1 phosphorylation immunoblotted with a phosphotyrosine antibody RC20H. The ability of IGF-I to stimulate IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced in cells expressing the double mutant receptors as compared to wild-type clones. In addition, the IGF-I-stimulated association of PTP1D and Grb2 with IRS-1 occurred to a much lower extent in double tyrosine mutants when compared with stimulated levels in wild-type clones (panels B and C, respectively). This effect was most dramatic in studies of IRS-1/PTP1D association.Figure 2:IRS-1 signal transduction pathway. Confluent monolayers of cells were made quiescent in serum-free medium overnight and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml IGF-I for 1 min at 37°C. Cells were lysed and IRS-1 immunoprecipitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” IRS-1 immunoprecipitates were separated by 9% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, and blotted with the appropriate antibodies. Panel A, immunoblot with polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody RC20H. Panel B, immunoblot with monoclonal anti-PTP1D antibody. Panel C, immunoblot with monoclonal anti-Grb2 antibody. The positions of protein molecular weight standards are indicated. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To evaluate Shc pathway activation, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml IGF-I for 5 min at 37°C as described above, and Shc immunoprecipitates were assayed for Shc phosphorylation and Grb2 association. Similar amounts of Shc proteins were detected when the membranes were reblotted with a polyclonal anti-Shc antibody (data not shown). A typical experiment is shown in Fig. 3, A and B, respectively. IGF-I stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of the 52- and 46-kDa isoforms of Shc protein (Fig. 3A) was observed in wild-type clones, whereas cells overexpressing the double tyrosine mutant receptors presented very low levels of Shc phosphorylation. Shc-Grb2 association following IGF-I stimulation was similarly diminished in mutant clones with respect to the wild-type clones (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that activation of both the IRS-1 and Shc pathways by IGF-I are at least partially blocked in cells overexpressing double tyrosine mutant receptors as compared with cells overexpressing a similar number of wild-type receptors.Figure 3:Shc signal transduction pathway. Confluent monolayers of cells were made quiescent in serum-free medium overnight and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml IGF-I for 5 min at 37°C. Cells were lysed, and Shc proteins were immunoprecipitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shc immunoprecipitates were separated by 9% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, and blotted with the appropriate antibodies. Panel A, immunoblot with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody RC20H. Panel B, immunoblot with monoclonal anti-Grb2 antibody. The positions of protein molecular weight standards are indicated. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In Vitro Cell GrowthTo determine whether the differential receptor autophosphorylation levels in IGF-I receptor double tyrosine mutants resulted in alterations in IGF-I-induced biological effects, we studied the growth rate of both wild-type and mutant cell lines in culture using the MTT assay. Cells were cultured either in DMEM with 1% FBS or DMEM plus 1% FBS supplemented with 100 ng/ml IGF-I. The results of a typical assay are shown in Fig. 4A. The mean and standard deviations of three separate experiments are plotted for the 120-h time point in Fig. 4B. Both wild-type and mutant clones failed to grow in DMEM with 1% FBS (data not shown). In contrast, wild-type clones grew well when stimulated with 100 ng/ml IGF-I. All mutant clones demonstrated a flat growth response to IGF-I and were not different than the pNeo clone (p > 0.05), whereas their growth response was significantly less than the wild-type clones (p < 0.01).Figure 4:Cell growth stimulation by IGF-I in culture. Cells were plated at 3 × 103 cells per well in 96-well plates in DMEM with 10% FBS. After 24 h, medium was changed to DMEM with 1% FBS and supplemented with 100 ng/ml IGF-I. All assays were carried out in triplicate. Panel A shows the results representative of three individual experiments. Panel B shows the mean of three independent experiments ± S.D., and the data are expressed as percentage of WT43 cell number at 120 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Tumor FormationOverexpression of wild-type IGF-I receptors in NIH-3T3 cells confers tumorigenicity(22Kaleko M. Rutter M.J. Miller D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 464-473Google Scholar). We therefore tested the double tyrosine mutants for tumor formation in nude mice. 1 × 107 cells of each clone were injected per mouse, and tumor measurements were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells overexpressing wild-type receptors typically started to form measurable tumors five and a half weeks after injection (Fig. 5). The size of these tumors increased progressively until the animals died or had to be sacrificed. In contrast, none of the cells expressing the double tyrosine mutants formed large tumors. Only the DYF23 (no. 1) clone gave rise to some tumors that were very small in comparison to the wild-type clones.Figure 5:Tumorigenicity of NIH-3T3 cells transfected with the double tyrosine mutants and wild-type IGF-I receptor. 1 × 107 cells were injected subcutaneously in nude mice. The animals were examined for tumor formation on the dorsal region, and tumor volume was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each point represents the mean of tumor volume measured in a group of four (DYF12(10) and DYF13(42)), five (DYF12(4), DYF12(33), DYF23(1), DYF23(46), and WT43), or six (WT50) mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe earliest post-binding event following the interaction of insulin and IGF-I with their specific receptors is the autophosphorylation of the triple tyrosine cluster within the β-subunit tyrosine kinase domain(7White M.F. Shoelson S.E. Keutmann H. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2969-2980Google Scholar, 8Murakimi M.S. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22653-22660Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase domain has provided interesting, and at the same time, controversial information about the regulatory role of these three tyrosines in receptor kinase activity. The most dramatic effect has been shown with insulin receptors where these three tyrosine residues (tyrosines 1158, 1162, and 1163) have been mutated to phenylalanine. Insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation and cell signaling by these mutant receptors are impaired(13Wilden P.A. Kahn C.R. Siddle K. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16660-16668Google Scholar, 23Wilden P.A. Siddle K. Haring E. Backer J.M. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13719-13727Google Scholar). Single substitutions of any one of these tyrosine residues with phenylalanine (i.e. Y1158F, Y1162F, or Y1163F) may reduce in vitro autophosphorylation of the receptor β-subunit on the remaining tyrosines and reduce tyrosine kinase activity, although, in contrast, Zhang and Roth (6Zhang B. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5113-5117Google Scholar) reported that the Y1158F mutation had no effect on autophosphorylation or on insulin-stimulated exogenous tyrosine kinase activity. Data on thymidine incorporation is also controversial. In general, however, substitutions of any single tyrosine have only slight effects on insulin-stimulated thymidine incorporation(13Wilden P.A.

https://openalex.org/W2095852063,"We have previously described a protocol for the simultaneous isolation and reconstitution of a protein kinase A (PKA)-sensitive outwardly rectified chloride channel (ORCC) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) from bovine tracheal epithelium. Immunoprecipitation of CFTR from this preparation prevented PKA activation of the ORCC, suggesting that CFTR regulated the ORCC and that this regulatory relationship was preserved throughout the purification procedure. We now report the purification of CFTR from bovine tracheal epithelia and the purification of a CFTR conduction mutant (G551D CFTR) from retrovirally transduced mouse L cells using a combination of alkali stripping, Triton-X extraction, and immunoaffinity chromatography. Immunopurified CFTR proteins were reconstituted in the absence and presence of ORCC. To test the hypothesis that only functional CFTR can support activation of ORCC by PKA and ATP, we used an inhibitory anti-CFTR505-511 peptide antibody or G551D CFTR. When anti-CFTR505-511 peptide antibodies were present prior to the addition of PKA and ATP, activation of both the ORCC and CFTR was prevented. If the antibody was added after activation of the ORCC and CFTR Cl- channels by PKA and ATP, only the CFTR Cl- channel was inhibited. When ORCC and G551D CFTR were co-incorporated into planar bilayers, only the ORCC was recorded and this channel could not be further activated by the addition of PKA and ATP. Thus, functional CFTR is required for activation of the ORCC by PKA and ATP. We also tested the hypothesis that PKA activation of ORCC was dependent on the extracellular presence of ATP. We added ATP on the presumed extracellular side of the lipid bilayer under conditions where it was not possible to activate the ORCC, i.e. in the presence of inhibitory anti-CFTR505-511 antibody or G551D CFTR. In both cases the ORCC regained PKA sensitivity. Moreover, the addition of hexokinase + glucose to the extracellular side prevented activation of the ORCCs by PKA and ATP in the presence of CFTR. These experiments confirm that both the presence of CFTR as well as the presence of ATP on the extracellular side is required for activation of the ORCC by PKA and ATP.

https://openalex.org/W1538053966,"The structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) has been studied using a novel combination of hydrogen/deuterium exchange and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Fourier transform infrared spectra show marked changes in both the amide I and amide II bands upon exposure of the nAChR to 2H2O. The substantial decrease in intensity of the amide II band reflects the exchange of roughly 30% of the peptide hydrogens within seconds of exposure to 2H2O, 50% after 30 min, 60% after 12 h, and 75% after prolonged exposure for several days at room temperature or lower temperatures. The 30% of peptide hydrogens that exchange within seconds is highly exposed to solvent and likely involved in random and turn conformations, whereas the 25% of exchange-resistant peptide hydrogens is relatively inaccessible to solvent and likely located in the transmembrane domains of the nAChR. Marked changes occur in the amide I contour within seconds of exposure of the nAChR to 2H2O as a result of relatively large downshifts in the frequencies of amide I component bands assigned to turns and random structures. In contrast, only subtle changes occur in the amide I contour between 3 min and 12 h after exposure to 2H2O as a result of slight downshifts in the frequencies of α-helix and β-sheet vibrations. It is demonstrated that the time courses and relative magnitudes of the amide I component band shifts can be used both as an aid in the assignment of component bands to specific secondary structures and as a probe of the exchange rates of different types of secondary structures in the nAChR. Significantly, the intensities of the band shifts reflecting the exchange of α-helical secondary structures are relatively weak indicating that a large proportion of the 25% exchange resistant peptides adopt an α-helical conformation. Conversely, no evidence is found for the existence of a large number of exchange-resistant β-strands. The exchange kinetics suggest a predominantly α-helical secondary structure for the transmembrane domains of the nAChR. The structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) has been studied using a novel combination of hydrogen/deuterium exchange and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Fourier transform infrared spectra show marked changes in both the amide I and amide II bands upon exposure of the nAChR to 2H2O. The substantial decrease in intensity of the amide II band reflects the exchange of roughly 30% of the peptide hydrogens within seconds of exposure to 2H2O, 50% after 30 min, 60% after 12 h, and 75% after prolonged exposure for several days at room temperature or lower temperatures. The 30% of peptide hydrogens that exchange within seconds is highly exposed to solvent and likely involved in random and turn conformations, whereas the 25% of exchange-resistant peptide hydrogens is relatively inaccessible to solvent and likely located in the transmembrane domains of the nAChR. Marked changes occur in the amide I contour within seconds of exposure of the nAChR to 2H2O as a result of relatively large downshifts in the frequencies of amide I component bands assigned to turns and random structures. In contrast, only subtle changes occur in the amide I contour between 3 min and 12 h after exposure to 2H2O as a result of slight downshifts in the frequencies of α-helix and β-sheet vibrations. It is demonstrated that the time courses and relative magnitudes of the amide I component band shifts can be used both as an aid in the assignment of component bands to specific secondary structures and as a probe of the exchange rates of different types of secondary structures in the nAChR. Significantly, the intensities of the band shifts reflecting the exchange of α-helical secondary structures are relatively weak indicating that a large proportion of the 25% exchange resistant peptides adopt an α-helical conformation.

Tumor cell adhesion (melanoma, ovarian carcinoma) to the α1(IV)531-543 chemically synthesized peptide was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody against the α3 integrin subunit, and to a lesser extent by monoclonal antibodies against the β1 and α2 integrin subunits. An anti-α5 monoclonal antibody and normal mouse IgG were ineffective as inhibitors of tumor cell adhesion to the peptide. Two cell surface proteins of 120 and 150 kDa bound to an α1(IV)531-543 peptide affinity column and were eluted with 20 mM EDTA. When the eluted proteins were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against either the α3 or β1 integrin subunit, proteins corresponding in molecular weight to α3 and β1 integrin subunits were precipitated. No proteins were immunoprecipated with monoclonal antibodies against the α2 or α5 integrin subunits. Thus, the α3β1 integrin from two tumor cell types has been shown to bind directly to the α1(IV)531-543 peptide.

https://openalex.org/W2106449387,"Model building studies have intimated a role for aspartic acid 301 in the substrate binding of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). We have tested this hypothesis by generating a range of CYP2D6 mutants substituting a variety of amino acids at this site. The mutant proteins, which included substitution with a negatively charged glutamic acid residue or neutral asparagine, alanine, or glycine residues, were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, a mutant where aspartic acid 301 was deleted was also tested. All the mutants expressed approximately equivalent amounts of recombinant apoprotein and, apart from the alanine 301 and the aspartic acid 301 deletion mutants, gave carbon monoxide difference spectra of similar magnitude to the wild type. In the cases of the alanine and deletion mutants, the amount of holoprotein was significantly reduced or absent relative to the amount of apoprotein, indicating restricted heme incorporation. The glutamic acid mutant was shown to have similar catalytic properties to the wild type enzyme toward the substrates debrisoquine and metoprolol; however, some differences in regioselectivity and ligand binding were observed. The mutants containing neutral amino acids at position 301 exhibited marked reductions in catalytic activity. At low substrate concentrations little, if any, activity toward debrisoquine and metoprolol was measured. However, at a higher substrate concentration (2 mM) some activity was observed (about 10-20% of wild type levels). Consistent with the above findings, the debrisoquine-induced spin changes in the mutant proteins were markedly reduced. These data collectively demonstrate that aspartic acid 301 plays an important role in determining the substrate specificity and activity of CYP2D6 and provide experimental evidence supporting the role of this amino acid in forming an electrostatic interaction between the basic nitrogen atom in CYP2D6 substrates and the carboxylate group of aspartic acid 301.

Although structurally diverse, all known ligands (substrates and inhibitors) of CYP2D6 possess a basic nitrogen, usually either an amine or a guanidino group, which is presumed to be protonated when the ligand is bound in the active site of the enzyme(2Guengerich F.P.

Based on this conformity, it has been proposed that the basic nitrogen of CYP2D6 substrates and inhibitors interacts with a negatively charged residue, such as aspartate or glutamate, in the active site of enzyme and that this electrostatic interaction facilitates binding and orientation of the ligand in the active site(3Wolff T.

This region maps to one of the substrate-recognition sites (SRS4) identified by Gotoh (11Gotoh O. J. Biol.

Several residues in the central region of the I-helix have also been shown by mutation to play a role in substrate specificity and/or reaction kinetics(15Fukuda T. Imai Y. Komori M. Nakamura M.

In this report we provide experimental evidence, through the use of site-directed mutagenesis, that Asp301 is of critical importance in the efficient oxidation of substrates by CYP2D6. The data are consistent with the proposal that Asp301 forms an ion pair with the basic nitrogen of CYP2D6 ligands, facilitating binding and orientation in the active site. Escherichia coli strains DH5α and CJ236 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH22 have been described elsewhere(18Ellis S.W. Ching M.S. Watson P.F. Henderson C.J. Simula A.P. Lennard M.S. Tucker G.T.

Metoprolol tartrate (racemate) and O-demethylmetoprolol and α-hydroxymetoprolol hydroxybenzoate metabolites were gifts from AB Hässle (Mölndal, Sweden). The hydrochloride salts of R-(+)- and S-(-)-metoprolol were gifts from Ciba-Geigy (Basel, Switzerland). Debrisoquine and its 4-hydroxymetabolite were donated by Hoffmann-La Roche (Basel, Switzerland). All other chemicals were obtained commercially and were of the highest grade of purity. Manipulations leading to the generation and isolation of recombinant constructs were performed according to standard protocols as described by Sambrook et al.(21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Mutant CYP2D6 cDNAs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the dut- ung- E. coli strain CJ236 according to the method of Kunkel et al.(19Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar). Point mutations at bp 903 C→A, 901 G→A, 902 A→C, and 902 A→G and a deletion of bp 901-903 were performed; when expressed these cDNAs give rise to the CYP2D6 mutants D301E, D301N, D301A, D301G, and D301δ, respectively. The mutated cDNAs were ligated into the BglII site of the yeast expression vector pMA91 and transformed into S. cerevisiae AH22 cells as described previously(20Ellis S.W. Rowland K. Harlow J.R. Lennard M.S. Woods H.F. Tucker G.T. Wolf C.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 112: 244PGoogle Scholar). All constructs were sequenced (Sequenase 2.0 kit, Amersham International, UK) before and after subcloning in pMA91 to confirm the presence of the desired mutation and the lack of any additional changes in the CYP2D6 sequence. Sequencing also confirmed that the ATG start codon of the CYP2D6 gene of each construct was distanced minimally (12 bp) from the end of the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter of pMA91. Transformation of S. cerevisiae was by electroporation(22Becker D.M. Guarte L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Yeast transformants were grown in batch culture in 1 liter of selective synthetic medium (0.67% w/v yeast minimal medium without amino acids, 0.04% w/v histidine, 3% w/v glucose) for 42 h (stationary phase) at 200 rpm and 30°C. After harvesting by centrifugation, the yeast cells were disrupted mechanically with glass beads (0.45-0.50 mm) at 4000 rpm for 40 s with liquid carbon dioxide in a cell homogenizer (B. Braun Medical Limited, Aylesbury, UK). The microsomal fraction was prepared by centrifugation of the homogenate at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C, followed by a further centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C. The microsomal pellet was washed twice with microsomal buffer (0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.65 M sorbitol and 0.1 mM EDTA), and aliquots were immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80°C prior to use. The relative apoprotein content of microsomes was estimated by separation on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204256) Google Scholar) and electrophoretic transfer to Hybond™ ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham International, UK). Blots were probed with rabbit anti-human CYP2D6 polyclonal antibodies and visualized by ECL using a streptavidin-horseradish peroxide conjugate and luminol (Amersham International, UK). The holoprotein content of microsomes was quantified by carbon monoxide-difference spectroscopy according to the method of Omura and Sato(24Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Values of apparent Kd and δAmax of debrisoquine and quinidine were determined from ligand-induced difference spectra as described by Jefcoate(25Jefcoate C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 258-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Incubation conditions for the oxidation of metoprolol (40 μM or 2 mM racemate, 40 μMR-(+)- or S-(-)-enantiomers and debrisoquine (250 μM), two probe substrates of CYP2D6, were as described previously(26Otton S.V. Crewe H.K. Lennard M.S. Tucker G.T. Woods H.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 247: 242-247PubMed Google Scholar). Incubates contained 10 or 30 pmol of CYP2D6 holoprotein, except those containing D301δ and yeast control microsomes (derived from yeast cells transformed with pMA91 lacking a CYP2D6 cDNA insert), which contained amounts of microsomal protein (0.1-4.0 mg) equivalent to the CYP2D6 holoprotein-containing incubates. Metoprolol metabolites (ODM and α-OH) were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography using a Nova-Pak C18 reverse-phase column and eluted with a mobile phase (pH 3) comprising water/acetonitrile (90:10, v/v) containing 1% (w/v) triethylamine at a flow rate of 3.0 ml/min(10Hasemann C.A. Kurumbail R.G. Boddupalli S.S. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1995; 3: 41-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). 4-Hydroxydebrisoquine was assayed using an identical column with a mobile phase (pH 2.5) of aqueous 4 mM KH2PO4/acetonitrile (90:10, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Metabolites were monitored by fluorescence detection at excitation/emission filter wavelengths of 193/300 nm for metoprolol metabolites, and 198/280 nm for 4-hydroxydebrisoquine. Yeast cells transformed with wild type and Asp301 mutant forms of CYP2D6, with the exception of D301δ, expressed similar amounts of immunodetectable microsomal bound CYP2D6 apoprotein (Fig. 1). The CYP2D6 holoprotein (heme-containing) content of microsomes, as determined by carbon monoxide-difference spectroscopy, varied depending on the mutant (representative spectra are shown in Fig. 2). No holoprotein was detectable in microsomes from the D301δ mutant, and a marked decrease (90%) was found in microsomes prepared from D301A (8 ± 4 pmol/mg protein) relative to wild type (49 ± 15 pmol/mg protein). The holoprotein content of microsomes prepared from the other mutants (D301E, 45 ± 22 pmol/mg protein; D301N, 29 ± 9 pmol/mg protein; D301G, 40 ± 12 pmol/mg protein) was comparable with that of wild type (Fig. 2). (The preceding mean ± S.D. P450 values were determined from at least 10 microsomal preparations in each case.) A Soret absorption maximum of 448 nm was observed with the carbon monoxide complex of wild type and D301E microsomes. This was shifted slightly to 450 nm with microsomes prepared from the D301N and D301G mutants and to 454 nm with the D301A mutant. Variable amounts of P420 were detectable in microsomes prepared from the D301A mutant only (Fig. 2).Figure 2Reduced carbon monoxide difference spectra of microsomes derived from yeast cells expressing wild type and Asp301 mutant forms of CYP2D6. Wild type (-), D301E(- - -), D301N (••••), D301A (○-○), D301G (- - -), and D301δ (○○) spectra were conducted with an equivalent amount of microsomal protein (5 mg) except D301A (15 mg).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Debrisoquine-induced difference spectra (type I) were obtainable only with microsomes prepared from yeast cells expressing wild type and D301E forms of CYP2D6 (Kd, 13 ± 5 and 35 ± 21 μM, respectively, and δAmax, 55 ± 2 μmol and 41 ± 19 μmol P450-1, respectively; each is a mean ± S.D. of three microsome preparations). Debrisoquine concentrations in excess of 500 μM failed to induce discernible spectral changes with microsomes from the D301N or D301A mutants. In contrast, quinidine, a potent specific inhibitor of CYP2D6, induced a type I difference spectrum with microsomes from the D301N (Kd, 99 ± 80 μM; δAmax, 35 ± 12 μmol P450-1) and D301A (Kd, 163 ± 113 μM; δAmax, 208 ± 103 μmol P450-1) mutants, in addition to wild type (Kd, 0.08 ± 0.06 μM; δAmax, 97 ± 8 μmol P450-1) and D301GE mutant (Kd, 0.72 ± 0.31 μM; δAmax, 51 ± 10 μmol P450-1; all values represent mean ± S.D. of three microsome preparations). Microsomes from D301G and D301δ mutants were not tested in these binding studies. Catalytic activity, as assessed by the oxidation of 250 μM debrisoquine and 40 μM (±)-metoprolol, was virtually absent (1-2% of wild type) in microsomes prepared from yeast cells expressing the mutant forms of CYP2D6, with the exception of D301E, which retained rates of activity comparable with that of the wild type (see Table 2). However, the regioselective oxidation of (±)-metoprolol, as assessed by the ratio of formation of ODM and α-OH metabolites, was significantly different with microsomes prepared from the D301E mutant compared with the wild type (8.5:1 and 3.8:1, respectively; p < 0.005) (Table 1). An alteration in the regioselective oxidation of metoprolol was also apparent with the R-(+)- and S-(-)-enantiomers (Table 2). In contrast, enantioselective oxidation was not altered by the substitution of Asp301 with Glu (Table 3). Thus, although O-demethylation was significantly R-enantioselective and α-hydroxylation showed a preference for S-(-)-metoprolol, the pattern and extent of this enantioselectivity were similar with microsomes prepared from wild type and D301E mutant (Table 2).TABLE I Open table in a new tab TABLE II Open table in a new tab TABLE III Open table in a new tab When the substrate concentration of (±)-metoprolol was increased 50-fold from 40 μM to 2 mM, significant formation of ODM and α-OH metabolites was observed in microsomes derived from all of the Asp301 mutants, with the exception of the D301δ (Table 3). In contrast to the insignificant level of oxidation of metoprolol at 40 μM, rates of formation of ODM and α-OH equivalent to 20-22% and 10-20% of wild type rates, respectively, were observed with microsomes derived from the D301N, D301A, and D301G mutants. Although highly variable, the regioselective oxidation of the substrate was also altered in the D301N and D301A mutants, while D301G retained the same regioselectivity as wild type (Table 3). The regioselectivity of metoprolol oxidation by D301E at a concentration of 2 mM was the same as that determined at 40 μM (TABLE II, TABLE I, TABLE III). The results demonstrate that Asp301 is a critical residue in the catalytic function of CYP2D6. Substitution of this carboxylate residue with a similar functional moiety (Glu) did not influence the catalytic competence of the enzyme significantly, although a subtle change in the regioselective oxidation of metoprolol and a 10-fold reduction in quinidine binding was observed. In contrast, substitution of Asp301 with neutral amino acids (Asn, Ala, Gly), differing in size and polarity, resulted in marked reductions in catalytic activity. While it appears that a negative charge at amino acid residue 301 is important for efficient CYP2D6 catalysis, the precise role of the negative charge cannot be ascertained from these results alone. Nevertheless, the data do support the proposal that the carboxylate anion of Asp301 forms a charge pair with the positively charged substrate nitrogen and, by doing so, facilitates the binding and orientation of the ligand in the active site. The ligand binding role of Asp301 is substantiated by the observation that replacement of the negatively charged residue with a neutral side chain results in substantial decreases in the binding capacity of debrisoquine (loss of type I spectrum) and quinidine (1000-fold greater Kd value). The requirement of a negative charge at position 301 for substrate binding can also be inferred from the catalytic data, which show that substantially higher concentrations of metoprolol were required to achieve significant catalytic activity in the mutants in which Asp301 was replaced with a neutral residue. Although full kinetic analyses have not been conducted, these results are indicative of a decrease in the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate. In addition, a reduction in the Vmax value of the mutated enzyme cannot be precluded. The altered regioselective oxidation of metoprolol in the D301E mutant compared with wild type suggests a slightly different orientation of the substrate in the active site of the enzyme. As no gross change in the integrity of the active site was apparent in this mutant (as evidenced by a normal Soret absorption maximum of 448 nm, good heme incorporation, and retention of catalytic activity), the altered regioselectivity could be due to a subtle difference in the location of the substrate oxidation sites relative to the (Fe-O)3+ entity, as a consequence of the extension of the carboxylate residue by a methylene group. Implicit in such a rationale is an interaction between a carboxylate residue in the active site of the enzyme and a positive charge of the substrate molecule. Thus the observed alteration in the regioselective oxidation of metoprolol by the D301E mutant adds weight to the proposal that Asp301 serves as a negatively charged substrate-contact residue in the active site of CYP2D6. The lack of effect of the D301E substitution on the enantioselective oxidation of metoprolol indicates that a residue(s) other than Asp301 is a determinant of CYP2D6 chiral selectivity. A candidate amino acid residue for such a role is Ser-304.2 When Asp301 was replaced with a neutral residue (Asn, Ala, or Gly), the structural integrity of the active site was also perturbed to varying degrees (as seen by the slight shift in the Soret absorption maximum of the carbon monoxide complex and in the different extent of heme incorporation). Thus an alternative explanation for the requirement of an anionic residue at position 301 for substrate binding is that this amino acid helps to maintain the integrity of the active site and that in its absence the topography of the site is altered. The different effects of the Ala and Gly substitutions on heme incorporation are difficult to explain. However, while both residues can be classed as neutral, Gly with only a hydrogen atom as a side chain can adopt a much wider range of main chain conformations than other residues and hence may accommodate and minimize potentially deleterious structural changes in the active site. The greater conformational flexibility of glycine is due to the lack of steric hindrance between its side chain atoms and the polypeptide main chain, thus allowing greater rotation around the Cα-C′ and the N-Cα bonds of a glycine residue(27Richardson J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 174-175Google Scholar). In this context, it may be significant that the central region of the I-helix of CYP2D6, in which Asp301 is located, comprises a sequence of non-polar residues (Leu295-Val308) interspersed at regular intervals with polar residues (Arg296, Asp301, Ser304). Modeling indicates that these polar residues all point in the direction of the proposed active site and potentially form one of its boundaries. 3S. W. Ellis and M. J. Ackland, unpublished observation. Thus, the introduction of a non-polar residue (Ala) into this polar zone may drastically perturb the local environment adjacent to the active site and directly or indirectly influence heme incorporation. This may not arise when Gly is the substituent due to the adaptable nature of this residue resulting in minimal conformational change of the active site. Koymans et al. (8Koymans L.M.H.

Design. 1993; 7: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have proposed Asp100 as an alternative carboxylate residue for the interaction with the basic nitrogen of CYP2D6 ligands. However, a recent homology model of the active site2 was unable to rationalize the involvement of this residue because of its peripheral location in the site. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis studies of Asp100 have confirmed that the substitution of this residue with neutral amino acids (Asn or Ala) does not adversely influence the catalytic competence of the enzyme. 4S. W. Ellis, G. Smith, G. P. Hayhurst, H. Rosengren, T. Lightfoot, M. S. Lennard, G. T. Tucker, and C. R. Wolf, manuscript in preparation. In the absence of a substrate-bound crystal structure of CYP2D6, the precise role(s) of Asp301 in CYP2D6 catalysis will remain unproven. Nevertheless, the present data strongly support the proposal that Asp301 is a ligand-binding residue in the active site of CYP2D6, interacting via a charge pair with the positively charged nitrogen of CYP2D6 ligands.

Available evidence suggests that calmodulin binds to a site between the two domains of nNOS, but it is not known how calmodulin then executes its switch function. To study the calmodulin-nNOS interaction, we created a series of chimeras between calmodulin and cardiac troponin C (cTnC, a homologue of calmodulin that does not activate nNOS). Although a few chimeras showed good ability to activate nNOS, most failed to activate. A subset of the inactive chimeras retained the ability to bind to nNOS and therefore functioned as potent competitive inhibitors of nNOS activation by calmodulin (CaM). The observed inhibition was additive with the arginine antagonists NG-monomethyl-L-arginine and 7-nitroindazole, indicating a distinct and independent mechanism of nNOS inhibition. To localize the calmodulin residues that account for impaired activation in the inhibitory CaM-cTnC chimeras, we conducted a detailed mutagenesis study, replacing CaM subdomains and individual amino acid residues with the corresponding residues from cTnC. This revealed that mutations in CaM helices 2 and 6 (its latch domain) have a disproportionate negative effect on nNOS activation.

https://openalex.org/W2018244330,"Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1 lacks a classical signal sequence to direct its secretion yet utilizes high affinity cell surface receptors to signal its heparin-dependent angiogenic and neurotrophic activities. We have previously reported that FGF-1 is released in response to temperature stress as a latent homodimer through a pathway that is potentiated by the Golgi inhibitor, brefeldin A (Jackson, A., Tarantini, F., Gamble, S., Friedman, S., and Maciag, T.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 33-36). In an attempt to further characterize this unconventional secretion mechanism, we sought to define the Cys residue(s) critical for FGF-1 dimer formation and release and to determine whether FGF-1 can associate with known phospholipid components of organelle or plasma membranes, which may be disturbed by brefeldin A. Utilizing FGF-1 Cys mutants, we were able to demonstrate that residue Cys30 is critical for FGF-1 release in response to heat shock. In addition, using solid phase phospholipid binding assays we demonstrate that FGF-1 is able to specifically associate with phosphatidylserine (PS). Heparin inhibits the association between FGF-1 and PS, and synthetic peptide competition assays suggest that the PS-binding domain of FGF-1 lies between residues 114 and 137.

We have previously reported that FGF-1 is released from FGF-1-transfected NIH 3T3 cells after heat shock(3Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Google Scholar). The secreted form of the protein is a biologically inactive homodimer that can be reduced in the extracellular environment to obtain a functional FGF-1 monomer (4Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Google Scholar). Cysteine residues are necessary for FGF-1 release since a FGF-1 Cys-free mutant is not secreted in response to heat shock(4Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Google Scholar). Moreover, the FGF-1 release pathway is independent of the ER-Golgi-mediated pathway since pretreatment of cells with brefeldin A, a drug known to block membrane transport from the ER to the cis-medial Golgi (5Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Google Scholar) prior to heat shock, augmented rather than decreased the level of FGF-1 secreted in response to temperature stress(4Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Google Scholar). Furthermore, methylamine and verapamil, drugs known to inhibit the exocytotic (6Sato S. Burdett I. Hughes R.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 8-18Google Scholar) and multidrug resistance (7Endicott J.A. Ling V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 137-171Google Scholar) pathways, respectively, also failed to interfere with the release of FGF-1 (4Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Google Scholar). In an effort to gain further insight into this unconventional mechanism of secretion, we attempted to determine which cysteine residue(s) is essential for the dimerization of FGF-1 prior to its release. Because intracellular FGF-1 exists primarily as a cytosol-associated protein (8Zhan X. Hu X.G. Friedman S. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 982-991Google Scholar) and a partially unfolded form of FGF-1 is able to interact with acidic phospholipid-containing liposomes(9Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9913-9920Google Scholar), we analyzed the ability of FGF-1 to bind acidic and neutral phospholipids. We report that FGF-1 is able to associate specifically with phosphatidylserine and the phospholipid-binding domain is located between FGF-1 residues 114 and 137. We also report that residue Cys30 is critical for the release of FGF-1 in response to heat shock. These data suggest that the domains responsible for FGF-1 homodimer formation and phospholipid binding are structurally independent. This property may therefore enable FGF-1 to dimerize and utilize the carboxyl-terminal region to interact with membrane/organelle-associated phosphatidylserine and/or other phospholipid-binding proteins during the secretion pathway. Human recombinant FGF-1 was purified as described previously(10Engleka K.A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11307-11315Google Scholar). FGF-1 was radiolabeled with Na125I (Amersham Corp.) using the Bolton-Hunter reaction in which 4 μg of protein was incubated with 1 μg of chloramine T and 0.7 mCi of Na125I for 30 s, and the reaction was stopped with 10 μg of metabisulfite. The protein was processed over a 0.4-ml heparin-Sepharose column and eluted with Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 24 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 136 mM NaCl and 2 mM KCl) containing 1.5 M NaCl. The specific activity was approximately 250-300 mCi/mM. Human recombinant (3-[125I]iodotyrosyl) epidermal growth factor (EGF) was purchased from Amersham Corp. L-α-Phosphatidyl-L-serine (PS), L-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC), L-α-phosphatidylinositol (PI), L-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and L-α-phosphatidyl-DL-glycerol (PG) were purchased from Sigma. Synthetic peptides corresponding to FGF-1 residues 114-137 (KKHAEKNWFVGLKKNGSCKRGPRT) and 15-29 (FNLPPGNYKKPKLLY) were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) model 431A peptide synthesizer and purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Amino acid analysis was conducted using a Waters Associates Pico-Tag system and amino acid sequencing was done using an Applied Biosystems model 477A protein sequencer. FGF-1(21-154) and FGF-1 Cys-free in the eukaryotic expression vector pMEXneo and FGF-1, FGF-1 Cys-free, and FGF-1 C131S in the prokaryotic expression vector pET3c were obtained as described previously(4Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Google Scholar). There are three different constructs in which two of the three Cys residues present in the human FGF-1 sequence (Cys30, Cys97, and Cys131) were alternatively replaced by Ser. These FGF-1 mutants, each containing a single Cys residue, were inserted into the pMEXneo expression vector (11Martin-Zanca D. Oskam R. Mitra G. Copeland T. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell.

The FGF-1 Cys30 (C97S/C131S) construct, in which only the Cys30 of the protein was conserved, was obtained as follows. The FGF-1 Cys-free/pMEXneo plasmid was purified using a Qiagen column (Qiagen, Inc.) and digested with BamHI/EcoRI restriction enzymes (Boehringer Mannheim); the 867-base pair band was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and subcloned into BamHI/EcoRI-digested FGF-1(21-154)/pMEXneo, gel-purified prior to ligation. The ligation was conducted with T4 ligase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the reaction product was analyzed by the dideoxy sequencing method (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The FGF-1 Cys97 (C30S/C131S) construct, in which residue Cys97 was conserved, was obtained by ligation of the 867-base pair fragment from the FGF-1 C131S/pET3c plasmid by digestion with BamHI/EcoRI into the BamHI/EcoRI compatible ends of the FGF-1 Cys-free/pMEXneo plasmid. Purification of plasmids, digestion, electroelution of bands, ligation, and analysis of the product were conducted as described previously(4Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Google Scholar). For the FGF-1 Cys131 (C30S/C97S) construct, in which residue Cys131 was conserved, the mutated sequence was cloned first into the pET3c vector(4Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Google Scholar). To obtain the FGF-1 C30S/C97S/pET3c construct, FGF-1/pET3c and FGF-1 Cys-free/pET3c were digested with the restriction enzyme, SphI. The 640-base pair fragment, gel-purified from FGF-1 Cys-free/pET3c, was ligated into the SphI-compatible ends of FGF-1/pET3c. Purification, ligation, and analysis of the product were conducted as described previously(4Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Google Scholar). The FGF-1 C30S/C97S/pET3c construct was digested with BamHI/EcoRI, and the 867-base pair fragment was gel-purified and subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI-compatible ends of FGF-1 Cys-free/pMEXneo. NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS). When the cells were 60-70% confluent, fresh medium was added, and the transfection was conducted using the calcium phosphate precipitation method with either 5 μg of Qiagen-purified FGF-1 Cys30, FGF-1 Cys97, or FGF-1 Cys131 DNA as described(4Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Google Scholar). The medium was changed with fresh DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FBS after 24 h, and 48 h after transfection the selection was started with DMEM, 10% (v/v) FBS containing 800 μg/ml geneticin. The medium containing the antibiotic was changed every 2nd day, and geneticin-resistant colonies were isolated and grown separately in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FBS and 400 μg/ml geneticin. The individual NIH 3T3 cell transfectants were grown to confluence and subjected to heat shock (42°C, 2 h) as described previously(4Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Google Scholar). Conditioned media were collected, and latent FGF-1 was activated with 0.1% (w/v) dithiothreitol and fractionated by heparin-Sepharose chromatography, and the 1.5 M NaCl elution fractions were resolved by 12.5% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to FGF-1 immunoblot analysis as described(4Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Google Scholar). Phospholipid binding assays were performed using polystyrene flat bottom wells (Dynatech Labs) as described(12Ortel T.L. Devore-Carter D. Quinn-Allen M.A. Kane W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4189-4198Google Scholar). Briefly, PS, PC, PI, PE, and PG were dissolved in ice-cold methanol to the desired concentrations (ranging from 1 to 10 μg/ml) and sonicated twice at 4°C for 5-10 s, and 100 μl of the individual phospholipid was used to coat each well. Wells coated with methanol alone were used as a control, and the wells were kept at 25°C for 18 h to evaporate the methanol. Nonspecific binding was minimized by incubation of the phospholipid-coated wells with TBS, containing 0.5% (w/v) gelatin, for 1 h at 37°C. The wells were washed three times with TBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and the binding assay was performed in TBS. For the heparin competition experiments, TBS containing 4 units/ml heparin (The Upjohn Co.), pH 7.4, was used as binding buffer. The labeled protein, 125I-FGF-1 or 125I-EGF, was added to the binding buffer, and the wells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C, aspirated, and washed three times with TBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. The amount of radiolabeled protein bound to the phospholipid was quantitated by an automatic γ counter. When the phospholipid binding assay was performed under conditions of increased ionic strength, 25-150 mM NaCl was added to the binding buffer prior to the addition of 125I-FGF-1. Similarly, the synthetic peptides were also added to the well prior to the addition of 125I-FGF-1 during the synthetic peptide competition experiments. We have previously reported that FGF-1 is released from FGF-1-transfected NIH 3T3 cells in response to heat shock as a latent homodimer, and we were able to utilize a FGF-1 Cys-free mutant to demonstrate the functional importance of Cys residues(4Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Google Scholar). Because two of the three Cys residues (Cys30 and Cys97) present in the human FGF-1 sequence are conserved among all known species of FGF-1(1Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Google Scholar), we sought to establish whether a critical Cys residue exists for FGF-1 homodimer formation during heat shock-induced FGF-1 secretion. Using the recombinant circle polymerase chain reaction, we created three FGF-1 mutants in which two of three Cys residues were converted to Ser (Fig. 1A). Stable NIH 3T3 transfectants for each of these mutants were obtained, and their expression levels were examined by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1B, the level of FGF-1 mutant expression was comparable with the expression of FGF-1 in the wild-type NIH 3T3 transfectants. These transfected cells were individually examined for their ability to release FGF-1 in response to heat shock. As shown in Fig. 1B, extracellular FGF-1 was observed in the conditioned medium from FGF-1 wild-type and FGF-1 Cys30 NIH 3T3 transfectants but not in the media conditioned by heat shock from either the FGF-1 Cys-free, FGF-1 Cys97, or FGF-1 Cys131 transfectants. These data suggest that Cys30, positioned near the NH2-terminal nuclear translocation signal in FGF-1(8Zhan X. Hu X.G. Friedman S. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 982-991Google Scholar), is critical for the entry of the protein into the heat shock-induced FGF-1 secretion pathway. Because brefeldin A potentiates rather than inhibits the release of FGF-1 in response to heat shock(4Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that FGF-1 may be associated with Golgi-derived membranes. Phospholipids are known components of plasma and organelle membranes; thus, several phospholipids were analyzed for their ability to interact with FGF-1. The acidic phospholipids, PS, PI, and PG, and the neutral phospholipids, PC and PE, were evaluated in solid phase phospholipid binding assays to assess the ability of the protein to bind phospholipid-coated polystyrene wells. In these assays, 125I-FGF-1 was able to associate with PS but not with either PI, PG, PC, or PE (Fig. 2A). In contrast, 125I-EGF, also an acidic protein of similar size(13Carpenter G. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7709-7712Google Scholar), was unable to interact with any of the phospholipids examined (data not shown). The association between 125I-FGF-1 and PS was saturable and dependent on the concentration of PS with half-maximal binding occurring at approximately 4 μg/ml (Fig. 2B). An analysis of the FGF-1 protein sequence for the presence of a consensus sequence for phospholipid binding (14Vorotnikov A.V. Bogatcheva N.V. Gusev N.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 911-916Google Scholar) revealed a putative structural motif in the carboxyl-terminal region of FGF-1 between residues 112 and 132. Because of the presence of several basic amino acids in this sequence(1Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Google Scholar), we anticipated that the interaction between PS and FGF-1 may involve ionic bonds. Indeed, the interaction between 125I-FGF-1 and PS was reduced by increasing the ionic strength of the binding buffer (Fig. 3A). We also sought to determine whether this domain was indeed responsible for PS binding. Using a synthetic peptide containing residues 114-137 from the FGF-1 sequence, it was possible to compete for the PS binding of 125I-FGF-1 in the solid phase binding assay (Fig. 3B). In contrast, a second peptide corresponding to FGF-1 residues 15-29, which includes the basic residues involved in nuclear translocation(8Zhan X. Hu X.G. Friedman S. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 982-991Google Scholar), was not able to compete with 125I-FGF-1 for PS binding (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the crystallographic structure of FGF-1 2Amino acid numbers refer to FGF-1 residues 1-154 as defined by the open-reading frame cDNA sequence (1Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Google Scholar). demonstrates that Lys127 and Lys132 of the putative phosphatidylserine binding domain are positioned around a sulfate molecule from the freezing medium(15Zhu X. Komiya H. Chirino A. Faham S. Fox G.M. Arakawa T. Hsu B.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1991; 251: 90-93Google Scholar). Since this sulfate may be interchangeable with phosphate, it is possible that Lys127 and Lys132 may be responsible for the binding of FGF-1 to the phosphate present in phosphatidylserine. Moreover, because the heparin-binding domain has been localized to a domain within the carboxyl-terminal region of FGF-1 (16Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Hampton B. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 131-138Google Scholar), we asked whether heparin could compete with PS for 125I-FGF-1 binding. Indeed, heparin was able to inhibit the interaction between 125I-FGF-1 and PS (Fig. 3C). Several proteins have been described that have Ca2+-dependent and -independent phospholipid-binding domains, and those that bind specifically to acidic phospholipids include members of the annexin family(17Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Google Scholar). Annexins have been implicated in membrane trafficking, signal transduction, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, inhibition of coagulation, and other activities, including Ca2+-regulated exocytosis and membrane fusion (17Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Google Scholar). Neuromodulin and neuroregulin (18Houbre D. Duportail G. Deloulme J.C. Baudier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7121-7131Google Scholar, 19Baudier J. Deloulme J.C. Van Dorsselaer A. Black D. Matthes H.W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 229-237Google Scholar) are among the proteins sharing the putative phospholipid-binding consensus sequence with FGF-1 and are brain-specific protein kinase C substrates. Interestingly, several functions have been proposed for these proteins, including an involvement in neurotransmitter release(19Baudier J. Deloulme J.C. Van Dorsselaer A. Black D. Matthes H.W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 229-237Google Scholar). Synaptotagmin, a component of exocytotic vesicles whose functional domains as a trafficking macromolecule are cytosol-oriented, has been described as a Ca2+-dependent PS-binding protein (20Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 260-263Google Scholar) and is also involved in the recycling of clathrin-coated endocytotic vesicles(21Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Google Scholar). While the ability of FGF-1 to interact with PS appears to be Ca2+-independent and FGF-1 does not contain a Ca2+-binding structural motif, it is likely that FGF-1 is not able to bind Ca2+. However, FGF-1 is well described as a Cu2+-binding protein(10Engleka K.A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11307-11315Google Scholar, 22Shing Y. Folkman J. Weisz P.B. Joullie M.M. Ewing W.R. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 108-111Google Scholar). It is also interesting that Cu2+ is able to oxidize the formation of FGF-1 homodimer(10Engleka K.A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11307-11315Google Scholar), and since the FGF-1 homodimer is released in response to heat shock, Cu2+ may be involved in the regulation of the FGF-1 secretion pathway. This may be particularly appropriate for the FGF-1 release mechanism since the domain responsible for FGF-1 homodimer formation resides near the NH2 terminus while the domain involved in PS binding resides near the COOH terminus of FGF-1. Recently, Mach and Middaugh (9Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9913-9920Google Scholar) reported that a thermally modified state of the FGF-1 protein is able to interact with negatively charged lipid vesicles at a neutral pH. In this system, a change in protein structure from its native, globular state to a partially unfolded “molten globular” state is required to obtain the binding of FGF-1 to unilamellar vesicles(9Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9913-9920Google Scholar). Interestingly, the temperature range that is required to obtain the unfolded state (9Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9913-9920Google Scholar) is consistent with the temperature that is able to stimulate the release of FGF-1(3Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Google Scholar), and our data are also consistent with the observation that FGF-1 is able to bind to acidic phospholipids(9Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9913-9920Google Scholar), with a specific affinity for PS. Further, the crystal structure for FGF-1 also predicts that residue Cys30 may not be accessible to solvent and may also require a significant structural rearrangement for it to participate in intermolecular disulfide bond formation. Indeed, our data argue that heat shock may enable FGF-1 to unfold and thus not only provide access of residue Cys30 for intermolecular disulfide bond formation but may enable FGF-1 to disrupt membrane structural integrity attaining characteristics of “molten globules” as described by Bychkova et al.(23Bychkova V.E. Pain R.H. Ptitsyn O.B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 238: 231-234Google Scholar) and van der Goot et al.(24van der Goot F.G. Gonzalez-Manas J.M. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Nature. 1991; 354: 408-410Google Scholar) for protein-membrane insertion and/or translocation. Since “molten globule” character has been assigned to FGF-1 as an acidic phospholipid-dependent state(9Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9913-9920Google Scholar, 25Mach H. Ryan J.A. Burke C.J. Volkin D.B. Middaugh C.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7703-7711Google Scholar), it is likely that the “molten globule” character of FGF-1 may be specific for PS. It is intriguing that the PS-binding domain in FGF-1 resides near the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein. It is possible that under conditions of temperature stress, the FGF-1 secretion pathway is activated and thermally modified FGF-1 undergoes dimerization through the Cys residue at position 30. Under these conditions, FGF-1 may still be able to maintain its ability to interact with the PS component of membranes through the carboxyl-terminal region. The interaction of FGF-1 with membranes may stabilize the partially unfolded state of the protein exposing domains that may be involved in the association of FGF-1 with other phospholipid-related molecules and/or other phospholipid-binding proteins. Alternatively, the interaction of the FGF-1 homodimer with PS may be dependent upon a structural rearrangement, which may provide solvent accessibility to PS. Due to the prevalent representation of PS in the inner face of plasma membranes it is likely that this cytosolic surface represents the target of FGF-1-PS binding activity. However, the significance of this protein-phospholipid interaction in relation to the transport of FGF-1 through the plasma membrane during temperature-induced secretion remains to be determined. We thank K. Wawzinski for expert secretarial support and W. H. Burgess for the synthetic peptides, S. Garfinkel for critical review of the manuscript, and the editorial staff for the astute comment concerning the solvent-inaccessible position of FGF-1 Cys30."

This model system was used for mapping functional domains in the primary sequence of Rac1, based on assessing the inhibitory effect of 90 individual overlapping pentadecapeptides, spanning the entire length of Rac1, on NADPH oxidase activation in two types of cell-free assay. Five functional domains were identified, each consisting of a cluster of contiguous residues shared by members of five groups of overlapping inhibitory peptides. Four of the five domains are exposed on the molecular surface of Rac1 and were not identified previously by mutational analysis; the fifth corresponds to a polybasic motif near the carboxyl terminus, confirming earlier reports. Screening the entire linear sequence of a protein with a battery of overlapping peptides for interference with its ability to interact with upstream or downstream molecules should be of wide applicability as a reliable, fast, and economical method for mapping of functionally relevant domains.

INTRODUCTIONOxygen-derived radicals are essential components in the microbicidal armory of phagocytic cells. The primordial oxygen radical, superoxide (O2), 1The abbreviations used are: O2superoxideRho GDIGDP dissociation inhibitor for RhoGTPSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. is generated by the one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen catalyzed by a membrane-contained heterodimeric flavocytochrome (cytochrome b559), utilizing cytosolic NADPH as the electron donor (reviewed in (1Rotrosen D. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, New York1992: 589-601Google Scholar) and (2Segal A.W. Abo A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 43-47Google Scholar)). The catalytic activity of cytochrome b559 is initiated by its interaction with at least two cytosolic components, p47phox and p67phox, which translocate to the membrane, leading to the assembly of what is known as the NADPH oxidase complex (reviewed in (3McPhail L.C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2011-2015Google Scholar)). NADPH oxidase activation can be mimicked in vitro by a cell-free system, consisting, in its most elementary form, of phagocyte membranes and cytosol (4Bromberg Y. Pick E. Cell Immunol. 1984; 88: 213-221Google Scholar, 5Bromberg Y. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13539-13545Google Scholar) and in its more sophisticated versions, of purified or recombinant components(6Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Kwong C.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1459-1462Google Scholar, 7Abo A. Boyhan A. West I. Thrasher A.J. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 167: 16767-16770Google Scholar), supplemented with a critical concentration of an anionic amphiphile, such as arachidonic acid or the sodium or lithium salts of dodecylsulfonic acid.Activation of NADPH oxidase was found to involve a GTP-binding protein (8Seifert R. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. FEBS Lett. 1986; 205: 161-165Google Scholar, 9Gabig T.G. English D. Akard L.P. Schell M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1685-1690Google Scholar) and this was identified as the Rho-like GTPase Rac1 (10Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Google Scholar) or Rac2 (11Knaus U.J. Heyworth P.G. Evans T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1991; 254: 1512-1515Google Scholar). Rac is found in the phagocyte cytosol as a heterodimer with the regulatory protein GDP dissociation inhibitor for Rho (Rho GDI)(10Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Google Scholar, 12Pick E. Gorzalczany Y. Engel S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 441-455Google Scholar). The central role of Rac in the activation of NADPH oxidase complex suggests that this well defined system could serve as a suitable model for the understanding of Rac function in particular and that of proteins of the Rho subfamily, in general. So far, two approaches have been used for this purpose. In the first, interaction of Rac with individual oxidase components was investigated, leading to the finding that Rac1, in the GTP-bound form, binds to p67phox(13Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Google Scholar, 14Prigmore E. Ahmed S. Best A. Kozma R. Manser E. Segal A.W. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10717-10722Google Scholar). The second approach was based on studying the effect of mutations performed in the putative effector region of Rac (based on the Ras model) on the ability of Rac to support NADPH oxidase activation in the cell-free system. This methodology led to the identification of residues 26, 27, 28, 30, 33, 35, 36, 38, 40, and 45 in Rac1 as being essential for the expression of oxidase activating ability(13Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Google Scholar, 15Xu X. Barry D.C. Settleman J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19868-19872Google Scholar).Here we describe a novel methodology for the identification of functional domains in the primary structure of proteins. This is based on testing a large set of overlapping synthetic peptides, spanning the entire amino acid sequence of the protein, for an inhibitory effect on an enzymatic reaction in which the relevant protein is an obligatory participant. We have applied this approach to the analysis of Rac1, with the purpose of identifying domains essential for sustaining activation of NADPH oxidase. Overlapping peptides were used in the past, almost exclusively, for mapping antibody-defined (18Geysen H.M. Rodda S.J. Mason T.J. Tribbick G. Schoofs P.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 102: 259-274Google Scholar) and T cell-defined (19Maeji N.J. Bray A.M. Geysen H.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 134: 23-33Google Scholar) linear epitopes in protein antigens.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSynthetic PeptidesNinety overlapping pentadecapeptides, spanning the entire length of the Rac1 sequence, starting at the first 15 residues at the amino terminus, were synthesized by the multipin synthesis method (20Valerio R.M. Benstead M. Bray A.M. Campbell R.A. Maeji N.J. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 168-177Google Scholar) by Chiron Mimotopes Peptide Systems, Clayton, Australia. Peptides overlap by 13 residues, with the exception of peptides 89 and 90, which overlap by 14 residues. All peptides were acetylated at the NH2 terminus and ended with a COOH-terminal amide. Purity was approximately 70%. The peptides were dissolved in a mixture (v/v) of 75 parts dimethyl sulfoxide and 25 parts water, to a concentration of 2 mM, divided into small aliquots and stored frozen at -75°C.Preparation of NADPH Oxidase ComponentsSubcellular fractions were obtained from guinea pig peritoneal macrophages, as described in (21Abo A. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23577-23585Google Scholar). Membranes were solubilized in n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside and processed as described in (22Shpungin S. Dotan I. Abo A. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9195-9203Google Scholar). A cytosolic fraction enriched in p47phox and p67phox was prepared as described in (23Pick E. Kroizman T. Abo A. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 4180-4187Google Scholar). Highly purified Rac1-Rho GDI dimer was prepared from macrophage cytosol, as recently described(12Pick E. Gorzalczany Y. Engel S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 441-455Google Scholar, 24Joseph G. Gorzalczany Y. Koshkin V. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29024-29031Google Scholar). Recombinant human Rac1 was isolated by purification of a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein from Escherichia coli transformed with Rac1 cDNA subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX2T(25Kwong C.H. Malech H.L. Rotrosen D. Leto T.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5711-5717Google Scholar). Purified recombinant Rac1 was loaded with guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS), as described in (10Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Google Scholar).Cell-free NADPH Oxidase AssayCell-free O2 production assays were performed at 25°C in 96-well plates in final volumes of 170-174 μl. Reaction mixtures consisted of (in the order of addition): 10 μl of solubilized membrane (resulting in a final concentration of cytochrome b559 of 5 nM); 10 μl of cytosol or a mixture of 10 μl of a cytosolic fraction enriched in p47phox and p67phox (corresponding to final concentrations of 1.5 and 0.6 nM, respectively) and 4 μl of highly purified Rac1-Rho GDI dimer (4.1 nM Rac1) or 2 μl of recombinant GTPγ S-bound Rac1 (130 nM), and 140 μl of assay buffer(21Abo A. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23577-23585Google Scholar), containing 200 μM cytochrome c and 130 μM lithium dodecyl sulfate, as the activator. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 90 s and catalysis initiated by the addition of 10 μl of NADPH (final concentration, 300 μM). O2 production was measured by following the rate of superoxide dismutase inhibitable cytochrome c reduction, at 550 nm, in a kinetic assay consisting of 30 measurements at 10-s intervals performed in a Ceres 900 HDi microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments), using KC Junior software. Results are expressed as maximum rates of O2 production. Peptides were added, in volumes of 1.7-3.4 μl, as the first component of the reaction mixture. Control mixtures were supplemented with an equal volume of 75% dimethyl sulfoxide. The effect of a peptide was expressed as percent inhibition of NADPH oxidase activation in relation to the activity of the control mixture, which was considered to be 100%. NADPH oxidase activities in the absence of peptides were 40-60 mol of O2/s/mol of cytochrome b559 and were dependent on the presence of Rac1 (NADPH oxidase activities, in the absence of Rac1, were less than 5 mol of O2/s/mol of cytochrome b559). In each experiment, peptide-containing assays and controls were run in triplicate.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONEach of the 90 individual peptides was tested, at a concentration of 20 μM, for the ability to inhibit O2 production in two types of cell-free NADPH oxidase activation assays. The first assay consisted of solubilized macrophage membranes combined with cytosol, whereas the second contained solubilized macrophage membranes combined with a cytosolic fraction enriched in p47phox and p67phox and highly purified cytosolic Rac1-Rho GDI. As apparent in Fig. 1, several groups of peptides caused significant and reproducible inhibition of NADPH oxidase activation. There was very good correlation between the ability of specific peptides to inhibit O2 production by mixtures of membranes and total cytosol (Fig. 1A) and their effect in a cell-free system consisting of membranes and purified cytosolic components (Fig. 1B). Substitution of purified Rac1-Rho GDI dimer by recombinant Rac1, in the GTPγ S-bound form, yielded identical results (data not shown). With one exception, all inhibitory peptides corresponded to residues located in the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of the Rac1 molecule. The inhibitory peptides were clustered in five groups: a, peptides 34-37 (spanning residues 67-87); b, peptides 46-53 (spanning residues 91-119); c, peptides 60-62 (spanning residues 119-137); d, peptides 77-83 (spanning residues 153-179); and e, peptides 86-90 (spanning residues 171-192). In addition to these clusters, three isolated peptides were found to be inhibitory: peptide 7 (residues 13-27) was weakly inhibitory, whereas peptides 43 (residues 85-99) and 55 (residues 109-123) caused significant inhibition.There were significant differences in the inhibitory potencies of peptides belonging to the various groups. Thus, peptides in groups a and c were the least active (IC50 exceeding 40 μM); peptides in groups b and d were more active (IC50 in the 20-40 μM range), whereas peptides in group e were the most potent (IC50 in the 1 μM range). There were no differences in the IC50 values of peptides when tested in cell-free assays containing purified Rac1-Rho GDI dimer (posttranslationally processed Rac1, in the GDP-bound form; (26Bromberg Y. Shani E. Joseph G. Gorzalczany Y. Sperling O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7055-7058Google Scholar)) or recombinant monomeric Rac1 (unprocessed, converted to the GTPγ S-bound form).Peptides were inhibitory only when added simultaneously with all components of the cell-free reaction (Fig. 2). No inhibition was observed when peptides were added 1 min after the initiation of activation, indicating that Rac1 peptides interfere with NADPH oxidase activation (assembly) and not with its catalytic function.Figure 2:Peptides prevent NADPH oxidase activation but do not interfere with catalytic activity. Peptide 46 (residues 91-105) was tested in a reaction mixture consisting of solubilized membrane, a cytosolic fraction enriched in p47phox and p67phox, and purified Rac1-Rho GDI dimer.

Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Google Scholar), inhibition of NADPH oxidase activation by Rac1 peptides offers a suitable model for the mapping of domains in Rac1 involved in protein-protein interactions. The most straightforward interpretation of our findings is that inhibitory peptides mimic domains in the intact Rac1 molecule and, consequently, compete with Rac1 for binding to another component of NADPH oxidase. However, it cannot, at present, be excluded that peptides interfere with some form of intramolecular interaction within Rac1, necessary for NADPH oxidase activation.Analysis of the five groups of inhibitory peptides revealed that all members of one group shared a minimal sequence domain or part of it. The precise boundaries of the domains could not be determined with absolute certitude by the present set of peptides and will require finer analysis, using peptides with a higher degree of overlap as well as truncated peptides.A remarkable feature of the grouping of inhibitory peptides was that some clusters could be divided into two subclusters of contiguous active peptides, divided by a group of one or more peptides with lesser or no inhibitory activity. This situation was most clearly expressed in peptide clusters b and d, as illustrated in Fig. 3. It can be seen that in both clusters, the expression of inhibitory activity was maximal when the putative domain was exposed at or close to either the carboxyl or amino terminus of the peptide. Peptides containing the domain at the center of the sequence were generally either inactive or less inhibitory. Therefore, the ability of a particular peptide to inhibit NADPH oxidase activation was dependent on the fraction of the complete functional domain expressed by the peptide and on its location within the peptide sequence.Figure 3:Relationship between the ability of overlapping Rac1 peptides to inhibit NADPH oxidase activation and the location of the putative functional domain in the peptide sequences. Results are derived from experiments in which peptides were added to reaction mixtures consisting of solubilized membrane and cytosol (see Fig. 1A). A, maximal inhibition was obtained when the putative domain HHCPN was exposed at the carboxyl-terminal end of the peptide (peptide 47). Activity was absent when the domain was at the center of the peptide (peptide 50) and reappeared when exposed at the amino-terminal end (peptide 52). B, maximal inhibition was obtained when the putative domain RGLKTVF was exposed at the carboxyl-terminal end of the peptide (peptide 78). Activity was absent when the domain was at or close to the center of the peptide (peptides 79-81) and reappeared when exposed at the amino-terminal end (peptide 82).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Using this strategy, for which we propose the name “peptide walking,” we were able to map five functional domains in the primary structure of Rac1, required for supporting NADPH oxidase activation. These domains are indicated in Fig. 4 and are labeled to parallel the classification of the five clusters of inhibitory peptides. One domain (cluster e) corresponds to the polybasic motif KKRKRK, recently defined by the inhibitory effect of positively charged peptides (24Joseph G. Gorzalczany Y. Koshkin V. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29024-29031Google Scholar, 30Kreck M.L. Uhlinger D.J. Tyagi S.R. Inge K.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4161-4168Google Scholar) and by mutational analysis(31Kreck M.L. Lambeth J.D. FASEB J. 1995; 9: A1413Google Scholar). Unlike in peptide clusters b and d, the location (central or exposed) of the polybasic motif within the sequences of peptides belonging to cluster e, had little effect on the ability of a particular peptide to inhibit NADPH oxidase activation. The other four domains were not previously known to be required for Rac1-supported NADPH oxidase activation. It is of interest that all Rac residues found earlier to be involved in NADPH oxidase activation by mutational analysis (13Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Google Scholar, 15Xu X. Barry D.C. Settleman J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23569-23574Google Scholar, 16Freeman J.L.R. Kreck M.L. Uhlinger D.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19868-19872Google Scholar) are located in the putative “effector domain” (residues 26-48), the boundaries of which were set by analogy with Ras(32Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Google Scholar). It has, however, been suggested, based on the generation of Ras/Rho chimeras, that proteins of the Rho subfamily possess a second effector domain, located in the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of the molecule, downstream of residue 69(33Self A.J. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 655-661Google Scholar). This suggestion is in good agreement with our findings, delineating five effector domains, all located downstream of residue 67. Experiments performed while this paper was being reviewed, involving systematic truncation of inhibitory peptides 47 and 78 starting from their amino termini, indicated that heptapeptides VRHHCPN, containing domain b, and RGLKTVF, indentical to domain d, inhibited NADPH oxidase activation.Figure 4:Putative functional domains in Rac1 required for activation of NADPH oxidase. A, the five domains revealed by inhibition of NADPH oxidase by clusters of overlapping peptides are indicated by the bold underlined single-letter amino acid codes in the linear sequence of Rac1. B, probable secondary structure elements corresponding to the five domains in Rac1, based on sequence alignment with Ras (34Valencia A. Chardin P. Wittinghofer A. Sander C.

Science. 1990; 247: 939-945Google Scholar), indicates that the major parts of domains a, b, c, and d are located at the molecular surface (Fig. 4B). The domains in Rac1, revealed by peptide walking, are analogous to domains, present in other low molecular mass GTPases, found to participate in protein-protein interactions. Most prominent among these is domain b (residues 103-107). This is analogous to a region governing functional specificity in a variety of GTPases, including the let-60 Ras gene product in Caenorhabditis elegans(36Beiter G.J. Clark S.G. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 503-509Google Scholar), c-Ha-Ras(37Willumsen B.M. Vass W.C. Velu T.J. Papageorge A.G. Schiller J.T. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6026-6033Google Scholar, 38Segal M.

Sci. 1995; 20: 10-12Google Scholar), and the yeast GTPases Ypt1 and Sec4(40Brennwald P. Novick P. Nature. 1993; 362: 560-563Google Scholar, 41Dunn B. Stearns T. Botstein D. Nature. 1993; 362: 563-565Google Scholar). The motif is likely to be important for interaction with guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Two structural elements, analogous to domains a and b in Rac1, were found to be required for stimulation of endocytosis by Rab5 (42Stenmark H. Valencia A. Martinez O. Ullrich O. Goud B. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 575-583Google Scholar) and correspond to two effector-activating clusters of residues in the α-subunit of the trimeric GTP-binding protein Gs(43Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the functional significance, in other GTPases, of residues analogous to domains c and d in Rac1, as defined here.We propose peptide walking as a general method for the identification of domains in the primary sequence of proteins interacting with either downstream effectors or upstream activators. The relative ease with which a large number of overlapping peptides can be prepared by the multipin synthesis method, with various lengths and extent of overlap, and either free or modified ends, makes this method especially attractive. Peptide walking appears to offer excellent reproducibility, opportunities for automation and is faster and more economical than site-directed mutagenesis or the generation of truncated or chimeric proteins. A number of techniques can be used for assessing the effect of peptides, in addition to inhibition of the protein's activity, as presently described. These include: inhibition by the peptides of specific protein to protein binding and measuring binding of the peptides to potential targets or modulators of the protein being mapped. Experiments using the latter technique for the identification of the NADPH oxidase component(s) recognized by Rac1 and of the domains in Rac1 involved in recognition are in progress.Peptide walking is, probably, not an effective approach to the detection of discontinuous (assembled) domains in proteins. Additional restraints might be imposed by the variable ability of peptides to assume a conformation similar to that of the corresponding region in the intact molecule. These limitations could explain the inability of peptide walking to identify the presumed effector domain of Rac1 (residues 26-48). For optimal results, therefore, peptide walking should be applied as one component of a wider mapping strategy, to include mutagenesis and the use of truncated and chimeric proteins.Addendum-While this manuscript was being prepared we became aware of the report by Barnard et al.(44Barnard D. Diaz B. Hettich L. Chuang E. Zhang X.-F. Avruch J. Marshall M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1283-1290Google Scholar), describing the use of a limited number of overlapping peptides, corresponding to the Ras binding domain of c-Raf-1, for defining sites of interaction between Raf and Ras. INTRODUCTIONOxygen-derived radicals are essential components in the microbicidal armory of phagocytic cells. The primordial oxygen radical, superoxide (O2), 1The abbreviations used are: O2superoxideRho GDIGDP dissociation inhibitor for RhoGTPSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. is generated by the one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen catalyzed by a membrane-contained heterodimeric flavocytochrome (cytochrome b559), utilizing cytosolic NADPH as the electron donor (reviewed in (1Rotrosen D. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, New York1992: 589-601Google Scholar) and (2Segal A.W. Abo A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 43-47Google Scholar)). The catalytic activity of cytochrome b559 is initiated by its interaction with at least two cytosolic components, p47phox and p67phox, which translocate to the membrane, leading to the assembly of what is known as the NADPH oxidase complex (reviewed in (3McPhail L.C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2011-2015Google Scholar)). NADPH oxidase activation can be mimicked in vitro by a cell-free system, consisting, in its most elementary form, of phagocyte membranes and cytosol (4Bromberg Y. Pick E. Cell Immunol. 1984; 88: 213-221Google Scholar, 5Bromberg Y. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13539-13545Google Scholar) and in its more sophisticated versions, of purified or recombinant components(6Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Kwong C.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1459-1462Google Scholar, 7Abo A. Boyhan A. West I. Thrasher A.J. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 167: 16767-16770Google Scholar), supplemented with a critical concentration of an anionic amphiphile, such as arachidonic acid or the sodium or lithium salts of dodecylsulfonic acid.Activation of NADPH oxidase was found to involve a GTP-binding protein (8Seifert R. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. FEBS Lett. 1986; 205: 161-165Google Scholar, 9Gabig T.G. English D. Akard L.P. Schell M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1685-1690Google Scholar) and this was identified as the Rho-like GTPase Rac1 (10Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Google Scholar) or Rac2 (11Knaus U.J. Heyworth P.G. Evans T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1991; 254: 1512-1515Google Scholar). Rac is found in the phagocyte cytosol as a heterodimer with the regulatory protein GDP dissociation inhibitor for Rho (Rho GDI)(10Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Google Scholar, 12Pick E. Gorzalczany Y. Engel S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 441-455Google Scholar). The central role of Rac in the activation of NADPH oxidase complex suggests that this well defined system could serve as a suitable model for the understanding of Rac function in particular and that of proteins of the Rho subfamily, in general. So far, two approaches have been used for this purpose. In the first, interaction of Rac with individual oxidase components was investigated, leading to the finding that Rac1, in the GTP-bound form, binds to p67phox(13Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Google Scholar, 14Prigmore E. Ahmed S. Best A. Kozma R. Manser E. Segal A.W. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10717-10722Google Scholar). The second approach was based on studying the effect of mutations performed in the putative effector region of Rac (based on the Ras model) on the ability of Rac to support NADPH oxidase activation in the cell-free system. This methodology led to the identification of residues 26, 27, 28, 30, 33, 35, 36, 38, 40, and 45 in Rac1 as being essential for the expression of oxidase activating ability(13Diekmann D. Abo A.

https://openalex.org/W2027580841,"A plant homolog of yeast HAL2 gene (RHL) was cloned from rice (Orizya sativa L.). The RHL cDNA complemented an Escherichia coli cysteine auxotrophic mutant, cysQ, and the yeast HAL2 mutant, met22. The latter is a methionine auxotroph and cannot use sulfate, sulfite, or sulfide as sulfur sources but exhibits wild-type activities of the enzymes necessary to assimilate sulfate and has normal sulfur uptake system. These results demonstrated that HAL2, cysQ, and RHL genes encode proteins with similar function in sulfur assimilatory pathway. The RHL cDNA expressed a 40-kDa protein that was shown to catalyze the conversion of adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS) and 3′(2′)-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP) to AMP. The enzyme activity is Mg2+-dependent, sensitive to Ca2+, Li+, and Na+ and activated by K+. The inhibition by Ca2+ depends on the Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio and is reversible by high Mg2+ concentration. The substrate specificity and kinetics of RHL enzyme are very similar to the Chlorella 3′(2′),5′-diphosphonucleoside 3′(2′)-phosphohydrolase (DPNPase). Our evidence suggests that this enzyme regulates the flux of sulfur in the sulfur-activation pathway by converting PAPS to APS. Several residues that are essential for the activity of this enzyme were identified by site-directed mutagenesis, and the possible role of DPNPase in salt tolerance is discussed."

The unique ability of rhizobia to nodulate leguminous plants largely depends on signal molecules that trigger the nodule-developmental program. These regulatory molecules, called Nod factors, consist of a lipo-chitooligosaccharide (LCO) 1The abbreviations used are: LCOlipo-chitooligosaccharideCIDcollision-induced dissociationFABfast atom bombardmentHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyMSmass spectrometryAdoMetS-adenosyl-L-methionine. core, modified with several substitutions(1Carlson R.W. Price N.P.J. Stacey G. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1994; 7: 684-695Google Scholar). The core contains a tri- to pentamer of β-1,4-linked GlcNAc residues and a fatty acyl moiety that replaces the N-acetyl group of the nonreducing end. This structure is common to all Nod factors, independent of their origin. However, the type of modifications, the length of the sugar chain, and the nature of the fatty acid differ from strain to strain. For example, the Nod factors produced by Azorhizobium caulinodans strain ORS571 are pentamers carrying a vaccenoyl or stearoyl chain. On the nonreducing end, the oligosaccharide is modified with a N-methyl and O-carbamoyl group, and the reducing end is branched with a D-arabinosyl sugar (2Mergaert P. Van Montagu M. Promé J.-C.

Strains were grown overnight, diluted to A600 = 0.1 in 1 ml of fresh medium, precultured for 1 h, and induced with 20 μM naringenin for ORS571 derivatives or with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside for DH5α derivatives. 2 h after induction, radioactive precursor was added (25 μCi/ml [2-14C]acetate (56 mCi/mmol), 1 μCi/ml [1-14C]GlcNAc (57 mCi/mmol), or 25 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]methionine (86 Ci/mmol) (radiochemicals were from Amersham, Aylesbury, United Kingdom)). 12 h after induction, the cultures were centrifuged, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of water + 500 μl of n-butyl alcohol. This mixture was vigorously shaken during 1 h. The two phases were separated, and the water phase was extracted a second time. The water phase was loaded on a Sephadex A-25 anion exchange column (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) (gel volume, 500 μl) equilibrated with water. The column was washed with 2 ml of water, and the unbound fraction was vacuum dried. Samples were analyzed by silica gel TLC(3Geremia R.A. Mergaert P. Geelen D. Van Montagu M. Holsters M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2669-2673Google Scholar). The 14C-labeled standards were obtained by reacetylation of hydrolyzed chitin with [1-14C]acetic anhydride (30 mCi/mmol, Amersham). The n-butyl alcohol phase was washed three times with 100 μl of water, vacuum dried, and dissolved in 500 μl of water. This solution was washed three times with 500 μl of ethyl acetate and vacuum dried. The samples were analyzed by octadecyl silica TLC (2Mergaert P. Van Montagu M. Promé J.-C. Holsters M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1551-1555Google Scholar). For labeling experiments in the presence of antibiotics, tunicamycin (10 μg/ml, Sigma) or bacitracin (150 μg/ml, Sigma) were added at the time of induction. For the experiment, described in Fig. 6, a DH5α(pUCNABCS) culture was grown at 25°C in the presence of [14C]GlcNAc (5 μCi/ml). The incubations were stopped at different time points. Quantification was done with a PhosphorImaging system from Molecular Dynamics, using the Image Quant software. In vitro incubations were as described(3Geremia R.A. Mergaert P. Geelen D. Van Montagu M. Holsters M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2669-2673Google Scholar), except that incubations were at 30°C for 90 min (except where stated otherwise) and no PPi was added. When AdoMet was included, a final concentration of 1 μg/μl was used. Tunicamycin or bacitracin concentrations were as described above. Reacetylation of deacetylated chitooligosaccharides was done as before(3Geremia R.A. Mergaert P. Geelen D. Van Montagu M. Holsters M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2669-2673Google Scholar). For the incubations described in Fig. 5B, UDP-[14C]GlcNAc was omitted, and 14C-labeled GlcNAc5 (≈4 mCi/mmol) was added (20,000 cpm per reaction). 4 liters of cultures, grown in LB- medium overnight at 37°C, were centrifuged, and the cells were resuspended in 100 ml of water, boiled during 5 min, and extracted with 100 ml of n-butyl alcohol. For the strains DH5α(pUCNC), DH5α(pUCNBC), and DH5α(pUCNBCS), the water phase was retained. For DH5α(pUCNABCS), the n-butyl alcohol extraction was repeated once, and the combined n-butyl alcohol phases were retained. Chromatographic purifications were followed using radioactively labeled metabolites. The NodABCS metabolites were further purified as was done for Nod factors of ORS571(pRG70)(2Mergaert P. Van Montagu M. Promé J.-C. Holsters M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1551-1555Google Scholar). The elution times of the NodABCS metabolites in the final HPLC purification step are given in Table 1. The aqueous solutions containing the NodC, NodBC, or NodBCS metabolites were vacuum concentrated to 10 ml, and trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 10%. The precipitate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was concentrated to ≈1 ml. This was loaded on a Bio-Gel P-2 column (Bio-Rad; 90 × 1.5 cm, 20 ml/h, eluent 0.1 M pyridine-acetate in water, pH 6.0), and fractions of 2 ml were collected. Nod metabolites were finally purified using an Econosil NH2 5-μl, 250 × 4.6-mm HPLC column (Alltech, Deerfield, IL) with a gradient from 80 to 50% CH3CN in 30 min. Elution times (in minutes) of the different Nod metabolites are 11.8, 15.0, 18.3, and 20.1 for the NodC metabolites GlcNAc2, GlcNAc3, GlcNAc4, and GlcNAc5, respectively, 24.4 for the NodBC metabolite GlcNGlcNAc4, and 27.5 for the NodBCS metabolite GlcNCH3GlcNAc4. Mass spectrometry was done with an AutoSpec 6F instrument (VG Analytical, Manchester, UK) equipped with a cesium bombardment source working at +30 kV. The matrix was either a 1:1 mixture of glycerol and 10% trichloroacetic acid for GlcNAc oligomers and their analogues or a 1:1:1 mixture of meta-nitrobenzyl alcohol, glycerol, and 10% trichloroacetic acid for LCOs. The energy of the secondary ion beam was 8 kV. For MS/MS, the collision cell was floating at 4 kV. Helium was the collision gas. Its pressure was adjusted as to reduce the beam to 50% of its original value. Constant ratio B/E scans were performed and averaged. Mass calibration was done using a Hall probe array. Fatty acids were analyzed as methyl esters with gas chromatography using a 5890A instrument (Hewlett-Packard, Wilmington, DE) equipped with an Ultra 2 silica capillary column coated with methyl phenyl silicone (25 m × 0.2 mm × 0.33 μm; Hewlett-Packard). In our previous study, we showed that the NodC protein synthesizes chitooligosaccharides with a polymerization degree up to five. These results were based on in vitro synthesis by protein extracts of ORS571(pRG70) or DH5α(pUCNC) of products that had the same chromatographic behavior as chitooligosaccharides and that were chitinase degradable(3Geremia R.A. Mergaert P. Geelen D. Van Montagu M. Holsters M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2669-2673Google Scholar). However, the in vitro production of NodC metabolites was too low to allow structural analysis. Therefore, in vivo synthesis of NodC metabolites in the strain DH5α(pUCNC) (Fig. 1) was studied. Using [14C]GlcNAc or [14C]acetate, we showed that in vivo produced NodC metabolites were similar to in vitro produced products (Fig. 2, lanes A4 and C2). The in vivo production was scaled up to purify the NodC products. Chromatographic fractions containing putative GlcNAc2, GlcNAc3, GlcNAc4, and GlcNAc5 were analyzed with FAB-MS and CID-MS. The CID-MS spectrum of the GlcNAc5 product, shown in Fig. 3A, displayed a [M+H]+ pseudo-molecular ion at m/z 1034 and fragment ions, formed by sequential glycosidic cleavages at m/z 813, 610, 407, and 204. The same spectrum was obtained with standard GlcNAc5. Also for the fractions that contained the putative GlcNAc4, GlcNAc3, and GlcNAc2, spectra were obtained in accordance to the assumed identity of the products. The ions were m/z 831 ([M+H]+), 610, 407, and 204 for GlcNAc4, m/z 628 ([M+H]+), 407, and 204 for GlcNAc3, and m/z 425 ([M+H]+) and 204 for GlcNAc2. Bacterial polysaccharides such as peptidoglycan and exopolysaccharides are synthesized on a undecaprenyl phosphate lipid carrier(12Bugg T.D.H. Brandish P.E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 119: 255-262Google Scholar). We investigated whether the NodC metabolites are also synthesized on such a carrier. Several attempts to isolate lipid-linked intermediates failed. Moreover, the antibiotics tunicamycin, which inhibits the transfer of GlcNAc-1-phosphate from UDP-GlcNAc to undecaprenyl phosphate, and bacitracin, which inhibits the dephosphorylation of undecaprenyl pyrophosphate, had no effect on the synthesis of the NodC metabolites neither in vitro nor in vivo (data not shown). Under certain conditions such as higher temperatures or longer incubation times, it was observed that in the in vitro incubation reaction using ORS571(pRG70) protein extracts, the NodC metabolites were absent, and new, slower migrating products appeared (Fig. 2C, lane 6). The possibility that these new products were modified forms of the NodC metabolites was investigated with a time course experiment. TLC analysis showed that after 5 min, the NodC metabolites could be detected, and they increased to a maximum at 15 min. Thereafter, the amount declined again (Fig. 4). A novel product, migrating just below the NodC metabolites, appeared with increasing intensity between 5 and 45 min (Fig. 4). This pattern was observed for the di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentamers and strongly suggested that after their synthesis, the NodC metabolites are modified to these novel products. The NodB protein of Rhizobium meliloti deacetylates the nonreducing end residue of chitooligosaccharides(5John M. Röhrig H. Schmidt J. Wieneke U. Schell J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 625-629Google Scholar). We investigated whether the novel metabolites were the deacetylated forms of the NodC metabolites and whether they were made by NodB. The in vitro and in vivo synthesis of the NodC metabolites and/or the novel metabolites was analyzed in the strains DH5α(pUCNBC) and DH5α(pUCNB) (Fig. 1). These experiments (Fig. 2, lanes A2, A5, and C3) showed that indeed the NodB protein was involved in the synthesis of the novel metabolites and that their synthesis also depended on the NodC protein. Therefore, they were called the NodBC metabolites. Chemical N-acetylation of the NodBC metabolites resulted in the formation of products that migrated on TLC (Fig. 4B) or HPLC (data not shown) at the position of GlcNAc1,2,3,4,5 standards and NodC metabolites, suggesting that the NodBC metabolites are indeed deacetylated chitooligosaccharides. To prove this and to localize the GlcN residue, the NodBC metabolites were synthesized in vivo by the DH5α(pUCNBC) strain. The putative pentasaccharide was purified and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The [M+H]+ pseudo-molecular ion was determined at m/z 992 in agreement with the mass of a pentasaccharide of four GlcNAc residues and one GlcN residue. The CID-MS spectrum (Fig. 3B) showed fragment ions at m/z 771, 568, 365, and 162. This fragmentation corresponded to GlcNAc5, which is deacetylated at the nonreducing end. We found that the NodS protein of A. caulinodans and Rhizobium strain NGR234 is an AdoMet-dependent methyl transferase involved in Nod factor methylation(9Geelen D. Mergaert P. Geremia R.A. Goormachtig S. Van Montagu M. Holsters M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 145-154Google Scholar, 10Geelen D. Leyman B. Mergaert P. Klarskov K. Van Montagu M. Geremia R. Holsters M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 387-397Google Scholar). When AdoMet was included in the in vitro synthesis of Nod metabolites, using ORS571(pRG70) protein extract, a novel product was formed with a lower mobility than the NodBC metabolite (Fig. 2C, lanes 6 and 7). The strain DH5α(pUCNBCS) (Fig. 1) was compared with DH5α(pUCNBC) for the in vitro and in vivo production of this new metabolite (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 7; Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 5). Also, protein extracts of the nodS mutant ORS571-1.59S(pRG70-1.59S) and the nodU mutant ORS571-1.31U(pRG70-1.31U) were tested (Fig. 2C, lanes 8 and 9). These results showed indeed that the metabolite was depending on the presence of the nodS gene and was, therefore, the NodBCS metabolite. The chemical structure of a pentameric NodBCS metabolite was determined by FAB-MS and CID-MS (Fig. 3C). The [M+H]+ pseudo-molecular ion was at m/z 1006, and fragment ions were at m/z 785, 582, 379, and 176. These ions were 14 mass units higher than the ions of the NodBC metabolites, in agreement with the presence of a methyl group at the nonreducing end of a deacetylated chitopentasaccharide. The NodS protein methylates in vitro deacetylated chitooligosaccharides but not chitooligosaccharides(10Geelen D. Leyman B. Mergaert P. Klarskov K. Van Montagu M. Geremia R. Holsters M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 387-397Google Scholar). An in vivo labeling experiment with the strains DH5α(pUCNBCS), DH5α(pUCNCS) (Fig. 1), and DH5α(pUCNBC) and using the precursors [14C]GlcNAc or [3H]methionine (methionine is a precursor for AdoMet) was performed (Fig. 5A). The three strains incorporated the [14C]GlcNAc label in chitooligosaccharides. In contrast, the [3H]methionine label was only incorporated in the chitooligosaccharides produced by DH5α(pUCNBCS). This observation showed that methylation by NodS needs the prior action of NodB. An in vitro time course experiment further confirmed this. As substrate, chemically synthesized [14C]GlcNAc5 was used. TLC analysis showed that the substrate was first converted to the deacetylated form and then to the methylated, deacetylated form (Fig. 5B). The NodA protein of R. meliloti is involved in the in vitro transfer of a fatty acid to deacetylated chitooligosaccharides(6Röhrig H. Schmidt J. Wieneke U. Kondorosi E. Barlier I. Schell J. John M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3122-3126Google Scholar, 7Atkinson E.M. Placic M.M. Hindsgaul O. Long S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8418-8422Google Scholar). Our attempts to form LCOs from in vitro synthesized deacetylated chitooligosaccharides using protein extracts from ORS571(pRG70) or DH5α(pUCNA) (Fig. 1) were unsuccessful even when substrates with high specific activity (about 100 Ci/mmol) were used. Therefore, the involvement of the azorhizobial NodA protein in acylation was studied by in vivo labeling experiments using DH5α(pUCNABC) and DH5α(pUCNABCS) (Fig. 1). Radioactive precursors used were [14C]acetate, [14C]GlcNAc, or [3H]methionine, and the production of lipo-chitooligosaccharides was analyzed by reverse-phase TLC. Both strains incorporated [14C]acetate or [14C]GlcNAc into molecules that comigrated on the TLC system with the Nod factors produced by ORS571(pRG70) (Fig. 2B). With [3H]methionine, however, these metabolites could only be labeled in the strain DH5α(pUCNABCS). The DH5α strains containing nodA, nodAB, nodB, nodC, nodBC, or nodBCS did not produce these Nod metabolites (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrated that NodABC was absolutely required and sufficient for the production of the Nod factor core and that the NodA protein was involved in the acyl transfer. The NodABCS metabolites were purified from DH5α(pUCNABCS) cells. The HPLC chromatogram of the final purification step displayed several peaks eluting in the region where azorhizobial Nod factors elute. These peaks were analyzed with FAB-MS and CID-MS, and in eight of them, LCOs were identified. As an example, the CID-MS spectrum of one of the major products is shown in Fig. 3D. The [M+H]+ pseudo-molecular ion was at m/z 1244, and the fragment ions were at m/z 1023, 820, 617, and 414. This pattern corresponded to a pentasaccharide of GlcNAc with, on the nonreducing end, a C16:0 and a methyl substitution. The CID-MS spectra of the other products were exactly the same (loss of 221, followed by three losses of 203 and with the ion derived from two GlcNAc losses as the most intense) except that the masses differed. This means that all the molecules consisted of five GlcNAc but that the substitutions at the nonreducing end differed. To obtain additional structural information, the fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography. The results, together with the data from the mass spectrometry, are summarized in Table 1. The HPLC peaks corresponding to the major NodABCS products (with a C16:0, C18:1, or C18:0 fatty acid) and some of the minor products were accompanied with a slightly slower migrating peak with approximately the same intensity. Products in these peaks showed the same MS spectrum as the products in the preceding peak except that they had a mass that is 42 units higher. This might indicate that these products were NodABCS metabolites, O-acetylated at the nonreducing end, a substitution that might be the result of an endogenous O-acetyl transferase. From the analysis of the water-soluble products of the in vivo labeling experiments with the strains DH5α(pUCNABC) and DH5α(pUCNABCS), it is clear that the NodBC and NodBCS metabolites, respectively, were still present, even after overnight incubation (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 8). The in vivo production of the NodBCS and NodABCS products was followed in function of time. DH5α(pUCNABCS) cells were labeled with [14C]GlcNAc, and, at regular time intervals, samples were analyzed. Both the NodBCS and NodABCS metabolites increased equally before reaching a maximum level (Fig. 6) at which they remained constant, even after 24 h of incubation (data not shown). The accumulation of NodBCS metabolites was not due to a stop in Nod metabolite synthesis. A control experiment, in which cells were incubated with [14C]acetate or [14C]GlcNAc at the time point where the NodBCS metabolites reached their constant level, showed that Nod metabolite synthesis was still going on (data not shown). nod genes of rhizobia code for proteins that are involved in the biosynthesis of lipo-chitooligosaccharide Nod factors. Azorhizobial nodABCS genes were introduced in various combinations into E. coli strain DH5α, and we found that nodABC genes are necessary and sufficient to produce the Nod factor core. In the case of the nodABCS construct, the LCOs are pentamers acylated at the nonreducing end with fatty acids varying in length from C14:0 to C18:0. The MS data, together with the [3H]methionine in vivo labeling studies, further show that the NodABCS metabolites are methylated at the nonreducing end, except for two minor compounds (see Table 1). This confirms that NodS is a methyl transferase involved in Nod factor methylation(9Geelen D. Mergaert P. Geremia R.A. Goormachtig S. Van Montagu M. Holsters M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 145-154Google Scholar, 10Geelen D. Leyman B. Mergaert P. Klarskov K. Van Montagu M. Geremia R. Holsters M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 387-397Google Scholar). Data obtained from analysis of the Nod factor intermediates produced by E. coli strains expressing nodC, nodBC, nodBCS, nodABC, and nodABCS are in agreement with the described in vitro enzymatic activities of the proteins encoded by these genes and show that these enzymes produce in vivo the same products as in vitro: NodC is a N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase synthesizing chitooligosaccharides with polymerization degree from 2 to 5, NodB deacetylates these products at the nonreducing end, NodS methylates the deacetylated products, and NodA transfers an acyl chain to the free amine at the nonreducing end. The variety of acyl chains found in the NodABCS metabolites produced in an E. coli background shows that the NodA protein of A. caulinodans has low specificity for the chain length of the fatty acid. Bacterial polysaccharides are often synthesized on the lipid carrier undecaprenyl phosphate(12Bugg T.D.H. Brandish P.E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 119: 255-262Google Scholar), and it was suggested that such lipids could be involved in Nod factor synthesis(1Carlson R.W. Price N.P.J. Stacey G. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1994; 7: 684-695Google Scholar, 4Spaink H.P. Wijfjes A.H.M. van der Drift K.M.G.M. Haverkamp J. Thomas-Oates J.E. Lugtenberg B.J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 821-831Google Scholar). However, we found no evidence for this hypothesis. First, we never detected lipid-linked intermediates in vitro nor in vivo. Second, the antibiotics tunicamycin and bacitracin had no effect on the synthesis of Nod factors or NodC metabolites in vivo and in vitro in A. caulinodans and E. coli. Tunicamycin specifically inhibits the transfer of GlcNAc-1-phosphate from UDP-GlcNAc to polyprenyl monophosphate acceptors. For example, in E. coli, the in vitro synthesis of GlcNAc-pyrophosphoryl-undecaprenol, an intermediate in the synthesis of enterobacterial common antigen, is totally inhibited by tunicamycin (13Barr K. Rick P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7142-7150Google Scholar) as is the in vivo synthesis of enterobacterial common antigen(14Rick P.D. Mayer H. Neumeyer B.A. Wolski S. Bitter-Suermann D. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 494-503Google Scholar). Bacitracin is a polypeptide antibiotic, inhibiting the dephosphorylation of polyprenol-pyrophosphate, thereby preventing the use of the lipid carrier(15Siewert G. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 57: 767-773Google Scholar). NodC is homologous to yeast chitin synthases (16Bulawa C.E. Wasco W. Nature. 1991; 353: 710Google Scholar) and hyaluronan synthase of group A streptococci(17DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Google Scholar). Also for these enzymes, no lipid-linked intermediates could be identified, and tunicamycin had no effect on the activity(18Duran A. Cabib E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4419-4425Google Scholar, 19Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5732-5739Google Scholar, 20Stoolmiller A.C. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 236-246Google Scholar, 21Sugahara K. Schwartz N.B. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6252-6261Google Scholar). The in vitro time course (Figure 4, Figure 5B) and the in vivo labeling of Nod metabolites in the strains DH5α(pUCNCS) and DH5α(pUCNBCS) (Fig. 5A) show the substrate-product relationship for the NodC-NodBC and NodBC-NodBCS products and that NodC, NodB, and NodS act in this order. The strain DH5α(pUCNABCS) produces both NodABCS and NodBCS metabolites, suggesting that also in the presence of NodA, NodS acts immediately after NodB, and NodA after NodS. The formation of LCOs in the strain DH5α(pUCNABCS) suggests a substrate-product relation for the NodBCS-NodABCS metabolites. A large pool of the NodBCS products, however, was not converted even though Nod factor synthesis was still proceeding. A possible explanation is that the NodC metabolites remain linked, covalently or noncovalently, to the NodC protein while the other proteins (NodB, NodS, and NodA) modify the protruding nonreducing end. Accumulation of NodBC or NodBCS metabolites in the strains DH5α(pUCNABC) or DH5α(pUCNABCS), respectively, would then be the outcome of insufficient NodA protein or acyl donor, resulting in the release from NodC in the cytoplasm where they cannot be acylated anymore. This would also explain why in vitro acylation of deacetylated chitooligosaccharides was unsuccessful in our hands and equally explains the inefficient in vitro acylation reported by Atkinson et al.(7Atkinson E.M. Placic M.M. Hindsgaul O. Long S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8418-8422Google Scholar) (only 0.1% of the substrate was converted). The proposed mechanism requires oligosaccharide elongation from the nonreducing end toward the reducing end, in agreement with a model concerning the action of β-glycosyl transferases(22Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Google Scholar). The chain length of Nod factors would be determined by the length of the sugar chain at the moment that the nonreducing end becomes accessible for the other proteins. A consequence of this model is that modifications on the reducing end of the Nod factor core have to be introduced after the synthesis of the core is completed, while modifications at the nonreducing end can be introduced either before or after acylation. This fits with data of Schultze et al. (23Schultze M. Staehelin C. Röhrig H. John M. Schmidt J. Kondorosi E. Schell J. Kondorosi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2706-2709Google Scholar) showing that the sulfate group at the reducing end of R. meliloti Nod factors is introduced after the core synthesis. The acetyl group present at the nonreducing end of the Nod factors of R. leguminosarum bv. viciae is introduced after deacetylation by NodB and before acylation by NodA(24Bloemberg, G.V., 1995, Biochemical function of the host specificity-determining nodulation genes of Rhizobium leguminosarum. Ph.D. thesis, Rijksuniversiteit Leiden, The Netherlands.Google Scholar). Also, our results concerning methylation by NodS ((10Geelen D. Leyman B. Mergaert P. Klarskov K. Van Montagu M. Geremia R. Holsters M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 387-397Google Scholar) and this work) are consistent with this. The E. coli strain expressing the nodABC genes provides a basis to analyze the functions of other nod genes in Nod factor modifications. Moreover, the strains DH5α(pUCNC) and DH5α(pUCNBC) can be used to determine where in the biochemical pathway a modification is introduced. The feasibility of such a strategy was shown in this work for the NodS protein. The role of NodU in carbamoylation of Nod factors was also confirmed making use of this approach.2 We are grateful to Marc Vancanneyt for gas chromatography analysis.

Myosin light chain kinases (MLCK) 1The abbreviations used are: MLCKmyosin light chain kinasesMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidSDS-PAGESDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresiskbkilobase pair(s)REFrat embryonic fibroblastsmsmooth muscle. are Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated, actin and myosin binding, Ser/Thr protein kinases (Kamm and Stull, 1985; Sellers and Pato, 1984). In skeletal muscle, contraction is regulated by the troponin system and phosphorylation of regulatory light chain by skeletal muscle MLCK has a modulatory role in contraction-induced potentiation of isometric twitch tension (Sweeney et al., 1993). In smooth muscle, phosphorylation of the 20-kDa regulatory light chain of myosin by MLCK is a well characterized event, important for the initiation of contraction (Kamm and Stull, 1985). The role of myosin phosphorylation by MLCK in non-muscle cells is not well characterized but correlates with activities such as cell division, receptor capping, and platelet or endothelial cell contraction (Kerrick and Bourguignon, 1984; Kolodney and Wyslomerski, 1992; Wyslomerski and Lagunoff, 1990; Holzapfel et al., 1983; Ehrlich et al., 1991; Guiliano et al., 1992; Kolega and Taylor, 1993; Adelstein and Conti, 1975; Garcia et al., 1995). myosin light chain kinases 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis kilobase pair(s) rat embryonic fibroblast smooth muscle. cDNAs representing vertebrate smooth and non-muscle MLCKs have been sequenced and the deduced amino acid sequences of the proteins compared (Gallagher et al., 1991; Kobayashi et al., 1992; Shoemaker et al., 1990; Olson et al., 1990). This comparison reveals a high degree of sequence homology (>97% similarity) that extends beyond the central catalytic core and calmodulin-binding autoinhibitory region (Gallagher et al., 1991; Kobayashi et al., 1992). The regions outside of the catalytic core and autoinhibitory region are comprised of several class I and class II structural motifs that are similar to those in the related family of giant muscle proteins such as twitchin and titin (Olson et al., 1990; Labeit et al., 1992). The amino terminus of the mammalian MLCKs also contains a 175-residue insert not present in the avian smooth and non-muscle MLCKs (Gallagher et al., 1991; Kobayashi et al., 1992). This insert is comprised of 15 tandem copies of a 12-residue repeat of unknown function. Recently, an actin-binding domain has been localized within the NH2 terminus between residues 29 and 80 (Kanoh et al., 1993; Gallagher, 1994). The extreme COOH terminus of smooth muscle MLCK is a highly acidic region of unknown function that is also expressed as an independent protein, telokin (Gallagher and Herring, 1991; Collinge et al., 1992; Yoshikai and Ikebe, 1992). Telokin and by analogy, the COOH terminus of smooth muscle MLCK have been proposed to be involved in myosin binding and myosin filament assembly (Shirinsky et al., 1993). Determination of molecular masses for smooth muscle MLCKs from several species has shown that these proteins have a similar size between 130 and 155 kDa (Gallagher et al., 1991). However, the masses determined by SDS-PAGE are slightly larger than the masses predicted by the deduced primary sequences (Gallagher et al., 1991; Kobayashi et al., 1993). For example, the rabbit uterine smooth muscle MLCK cDNA encodes a protein of 126 kDa while the recombinant and tissue forms migrate at 152 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The amino terminus of the chicken smooth muscle MLCK has been established by direct sequencing of a CNBr subfragment obtained from the purified protein (Faux et al., 1993). The six NH2-terminal residues (MDFRAN) identified correspond exactly to the first six residues predicted by the 5′ coding region for the chicken, rabbit, and bovine cDNAs (Olson et al., 1990; Gallagher et al., 1991; Kobayashi et al., 1993), suggesting that all of the smooth muscle MLCKs have the same amino termini. The non-muscle MLCK is reported to be identical to smooth muscle isoforms except for the presence of an additional 286-residues extending the NH2 terminus of the predicted protein (Shoemaker et al., 1990). This additional sequence would increase the mass of the protein by approximately 35 kDa (Shoemaker et al., 1990). Western blotting of smooth and non-muscle tissues demonstrated that the major form of MLCK expressed in these tissues has the same mass as the smooth muscle MLCK. A larger protein corresponding to the non-muscle MLCK and having an appropriate molecular mass (>165 kDa) as predicted by the chicken embryo fibroblast cDNA has not been detected in any tissues (Gallagher et al., 1991). Recently, Gibson and Higgins(1993) suggested that the cDNA encoding the non-muscle MLCK may be incomplete as additional class II structural motifs appear to be present in the 5′-untranslated region of the reported cDNA. The failure to detect a larger mass MLCK in non-muscle tissues may be because this protein is expressed at low levels or because it is expressed only in specific non-muscle tissues. It is also possible that this cDNA, isolated from primary embryonic fibroblast cells, represents a form of MLCK that is developmentally regulated and its expression may not be detectable in adult tissues. For these reasons, we have examined MLCK expression in embryonic and adult tissues and in cultured cells by Western blotting. These studies reveal the existence of a 208-kDa protein, named embryonic MLCK because its expression can be detected in early embryonic tissues, stem cells, and in proliferating cultured cells. 208-kDa protein is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent MLCK that is structurally distinct both from the smooth muscle MLCK and the protein predicted by the chicken non-muscle MLCK cDNA. Proteins were extracted from tissues and cells using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 1.25 mM EGTA, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM MgCl2, 300 mM NaCl, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Extracts were separated by electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and reacted with antibodies to smooth muscle MLCK as described previously (Gallagher et al., 1991) except that proteins were separated on 5% polyacrylamide SDS gels and electrophoretic transfers carried out for 18 h. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using the ECL chemiluminescent detection system according to the manufacturers directions (Amersham). Four antibodies directed against smooth muscle MLCK were used in this study and are described in Table 1. Preadsorption of anti-smMLCK or anti-Repeat antibodies was achieved by incubating diluting serum with nitrocellulose saturated with the repeat peptide. The relative intensities of the protein in the bands were quantified by scanning densitometry. 208-kDa embryonic MLCK was immunoprecipitated under nondenaturing conditions from REF cell extracts prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Cells from a 100 mM dish were lysed in 400 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and clarified by centrifugation for 5 min. The clarified supernatant was diluted 1:4 in wash buffer (20 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mM magnesium acetate) prior to immunoprecipitation. 5 μl of anti-Repeat antibody or 5 μl of preimmune serum and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (10% suspension) were incubated with the diluted cell extracts for 4 h at 4°C then centrifuged to collect immune complexes. The immune complexes were washed three times by resuspending the complexes in wash buffer and then subjected to Western immunoblot analysis as described above or resuspended in kinase assay reaction buffer for activity measurements. MLCK immunoprecipitated from REF cells or from COS cells transiently expressing recombinant rabbit uterine smooth muscle MLCK was used directly for MLCK activity assays measuring incorporation of 32P into purified regulatory light chains as described previously (Gallagher et al., 1991). Briefly the immunoprecipitate was resuspended in 40 μl of kinase assay reaction buffer (50 mM MOPS, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 0.3 mM calcium chloride, 1.0 μM calmodulin, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 15 μM purified gizzard regulatory light chains). The reaction was initiated by addition of 10 μl of [gamma-32P]ATP to a final concentration of 1 mM. Background rates of incorporation for immunoprecipitated 208-kDa protein using specific antibodies were determined in parallel in the presence of 3 mM EGTA or by protein immunoprecipitated using preimmune serum. The remaining fraction of the assay mixture was diluted with an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained, dried, then exposed to film to detect incorporation of 32P into protein. Mouse embryos or when discernable, embryonic tissues, were obtained by dissection of embryos at the various times following fertilization. Either whole embryos or specific tissues were dissected and frozen in liquid N2, pulverized, then extracts prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Undifferentiated murine embryonic stem cells (ES-D3 cell line, ATCC CRL1934) were maintained in medium conditioned by leukemia inhibitory factor; differentiated murine embryonic stem cells were obtained by replating embryoid bodies after 4 days in suspension culture in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor. A10, rat embryonic thoracic aorta cell line (ATCC CRL1476) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum. REF, rat embryo fibroblasts (Pavalko and Burridge, 1991); 3T3, mouse fibroblasts (ATCC CCL92); COS fibroblasts (ATCC CRL1650); chicken embryo fibroblasts (ATCC CRL1590), and human umbilical endothelial (ATCC CRL1730) cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. AT1 and AT2 cardiac cells were obtained from Dr. Loren Field and are cardiac cells derived from a transplantable transgenic tumor lineage (Kline et al., 1993). RNA was isolated from tissues and cells and a Northern blot prepared as described previously (Gallagher et al., 1991). The blot was probed with 32P-labeled random-primed cDNA corresponding to the 2.9-kb NcoI fragment derived from the cDNA encoding the rabbit smooth muscle MLCK (corresponding to nucleotides 714-3705). Hybridization was performed at 68°C and final wash was in 2.5 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 30 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, and 0.1% SDS. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared by magnetic affinity chromatography (Promega). Previous studies have shown that the molecular mass of the smooth muscle MLCK ranges from 130 to 155 kDa depending on the species and this form of MLCK can be detected in both smooth and non-muscle tissues (Gallagher et al., 1991). In the present study, analysis of cellular extracts from the rat A10 smooth muscle cultured cell line demonstrated that in addition to the 136-kDa rat smooth muscle MLCK, a protein of 208 kDa was detected with an anti-smMLCK polyclonal antibody. Examination of several rat tissues and rat embryonic fibroblast (REF) and murine 3T3 cultured cell lines revealed that the 208-kDa protein was apparent only in the cultured cell lines (Fig. 1A). Examination of smooth and non-muscle tissues from three species showed that the predominant immunoreactive protein is the 130-155 kDa smooth muscle MLCK consistent with previous findings (Gallagher et al., 1991) although in some tissues a 208-kDa protein could be detected when the immunoblot is overexposed (Fig. 1B). Smooth muscle MLCK (130-155 kDa) can be detected in most cultured cell lines, with relatively higher expression levels being detected in muscle-derived cell lines such as A10 smooth muscle, the AT-1 and AT-2 cardiac muscle lines (Fig. 1C). Although not visible in Fig. 1C, 130-155-kDa smooth muscle MLCKs can be detected in chicken embryo fibroblast, COS, and human umbilical endothelial cells, when greater amounts of total protein are analyzed. However, the predominant immunoreactive protein in most cells lines is 208-kDa MLCK. Only two cell lines, REF (Fig. 1C) and undifferentiated murine embryonic stem cells, lack any detectable level of smooth muscle MLCK expression using the available reagents. The relationship of the 208-kDa cross-reacting protein detected in A10 and REF cells to the 136-kDa rat smooth muscle MLCK was examined using four anti-smooth muscle MLCK antibodies and biotinylated calmodulin, which binds to high affinity Ca2+/calmodulin binding proteins such as smooth muscle MLCK (Hubbard and Klee, 1987). A 136-kDa rat smooth muscle MLCK was detected in extracts from A10 cells using each of the antibodies but could not be detected in REF cells using any of the antibodies or biotinylated calmodulin, suggesting this cell line does not express smooth muscle MLCK (Fig. 2). The 208-kDa cross-reacting protein was detected in both A10 and REF cells using either anti-smMLCK or anti-Repeat antibodies. Comparison of the signals obtained using these antibodies suggests that the anti-Repeat antibody reacts significantly better with the 208-kDa protein than with the 136-kDa smMLCK, possibly because it has additional sets of the repeated motif “KPVGNAKPAETL” that is found in smMLCK (Gallagher et al., 1991). In contrast, an antibody to the carboxyl terminus and an antibody that binds near the amino terminus do not cross-react with the 208-kDa protein in A10 or REF cell lines, even though both antibodies react with 136-kDa smooth muscle MLCK expressed in A10 cells (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows that a number of Ca2+/calmodulin binding proteins are detected in cell extracts from A10 and REF cells. To unambiguously determine if 208-kDa protein can be detected by Ca2+/calmodulin, anti-Repeat antibody was used to immunoprecipitate 208-kDa protein from cell extracts. After transfer to nitrocellulose, the 208-kDa protein in both A10 and REF cells as well as the 136-kDa smooth muscle MLCK in A10 cells could be detected using biotinylated calmodulin in the presence of ca2+lcium (Fig. 2B). To determine if the anti-smMLCK antibody recognizes epitopes in addition to the repeated sequence present in mammalian MLCK, this serum was preadsorbed using the repeat peptide. A solid phase binding assay was performed to confirm that the antibodies to the repeated region had been completely adsorbed (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2C, the preadsorbed serum recognizes both 136-kDa smooth muscle MLCK and 208-kDa protein, confirming that at least some antigenic epitopes in addition to the repeated region exist between the smooth muscle MLCK and the 208-kDa protein. A control Western blotting experiment using preadsorbed anti-Repeat antibody showed a loss of detection of both 136-kDa rat smooth muscle MLCK and 208-kDa protein in both A10 and REF cell extracts. The 208-kDa protein detected in REF cells was immunoprecipitated and tested for its ability to phosphorylate purified myosin regulatory light chains in an in vitro assay. Immunoprecipitation was performed using either anti-Repeat antibody, preimmune serum, or anti-smMLCK antibody. Kinase assays were performed using the immunoprecipitated proteins from 200 μg (100 μl) or 400 μg (200 μl) cell extracts, purified light chains, [32P]ATP, and Ca2+/calmodulin or in the presence of EGTA. Activity was measured as rate of incorporation of 32P into purified regulatory light chains. Fig. 3 shows a representative of four independent assays using different amounts of cell extracts. These assays reveal that the 208-kDa protein immunoprecipitated by anti-Repeat (Fig. 3) or anti-smMLCK antibodies (data not shown) has a linear rate of incorporation of 32P into light chain that is dependent on Ca2+/calmodulin. Only a small amount of incorporation in the absence of Ca2+ (EGTA) or from immunoprecipitates using preimmune serum was detected. Rates of incorporation varied between 2.7 and 5.4 pmol/min/μl cell extract, compared to a rate of 9-15 pmol/min/μl obtained by immunoprecipitating recombinant rabbit uterine smooth muscle MLCK transiently expressed in COS cells (data not shown). Examination of proteins labeled by incorporation of 32P during the assay revealed that the only significant radiolabeled protein was the myosin regulatory light chain (Fig. 3B). Autoradiography showed that only those reactions containing Ca2+/CaM and extracts immunoprecipitated by anti-Repeat antibody (Fig. 3B) or anti-smMLCK antibody (data not shown) resulted in significant incorporation of 32P into light chains. As antibodies to smooth muscle MLCK detect a 208-kDa protein by Western blotting analysis, Northern blotting was used to determine if additional mRNAs could be detected by probes corresponding to smooth muscle MLCK. Fig. 4 shows that a probe derived from the rabbit smooth muscle MLCK detects the 2.6-kb mRNA encoding telokin, the independently expressed COOH terminus of smooth muscle MLCK and the 5.7-kb mRNA encoding smooth muscle MLCK in both rat uterine tissue and cultured rat A10 cells (Gallagher et al., 1991; Gallagher and Herring 1991). In rat A10 cells, and upon prolonged exposure of the blot in rat uterine tissue, an 8.7-kb mRNA is also detected. As the relative expression of 208 kDa protein appears to be higher in rat A10 cells than in rat uterine tissue, this result would suggest that the 8.7-kb mRNA may encode the 208-kDa protein. Examination of undifferentiated murine embryonic stem cells by Western blotting revealed that only the 208-kDa protein is expressed (Fig. 5). Following induction of differentiation by replating embryoid bodies expression of 130 kDa murine smooth muscle MLCK can be detected beginning at day 7 (Fig. 5). 2B. P. Herring, unpublished observations. In embryonic tissues the 208-kDa protein and the 130-kDa murine smooth muscle MLCK are both detected, although the relative levels of each change during development. Analysis of extracts from whole mouse embryos shows that 130-kDa murine smooth muscle MLCK and 208-kDa protein are both expressed in E8 and E12 extracts. Fig. 5 shows the relative expression of 208-kDa protein declines 6.3-fold from embryonic day 15 (E15) to neonatal day 5(N5) to an undetectable level following birth in adult heart. In liver, a less dramatic decline in expression is detected (1.6-fold). In contrast, the relative expression of the smooth muscle MLCK increases during development in both heart (5-fold between E15 and adult) and liver (1.5-fold between E15 and adult). This suggests that expression of smooth muscle MLCK and 208-kDa protein are inversely regulated during development, with expression of the 208-kDa protein declining and expression of smooth muscle MLCK increasing in adult tissues. A 208-kDa MLCK has been identified as a new member of the MLCK family based upon its immunological and biochemical properties. The 208-kDa MLCK is detected in extracts of cultured cells and tissues by two polyclonal antibodies specific for smooth muscle MLCK (anti-smMLCK and anti-Repeat antibody). In activity assays, 208-kDa MLCK phosphorylates purified myosin regulatory light chains in a manner consistent with the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent properties of all previously characterized eucaryotic MLCKs (Stull et al., 1991; Kamm and Stull, 1985). As the 208-kDa MLCK is expressed in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and early embryonic tissues, we suggest the name embryonic MLCK. The lack of immunoreactivity of 208-kDa embryonic MLCK with two additional antibodies specific for smooth muscle MLCK (anti-NH2-terminal and anti-COOH-terminal) suggests that the amino and carboxyl termini of this molecule differ from the smooth muscle MLCK, which is detected by both these antibodies. This result also distinguishes 208-kDa embryonic MLCK from the predicted protein encoded by the chicken embryo fibroblast non-muscle MLCK cDNA (Shoemaker et al., 1990). The developmental expression pattern of 208-kDa embryonic MLCK is of interest, as many actomyosin-dependent events occur in proliferating, migrating cells that are distinct from those occurring in differentiated, non-proliferative tissues. The temporal expression pattern of 208-kDa embryonic MLCK compared to 130-kDa murine smooth muscle MLCK shows that this form is expressed at high levels early during development in embryonic tissues. Expression of 208-kDa embryonic MLCK declines at birth to low or undetectable levels in most adult tissues, although in some tissues such as liver down-regulation of 208-kDa embryonic MLCK is not as dramatic. The decline in expression of embryonic MLCK in cardiac tissues is generally coincident with cessation of cardiomyocyte proliferation and terminal differentiation which occurs shortly following birth in rodents (Rumyantsev, 1991). In liver, a less dramatic decline in expression of embryonic MLCK occurs, possibly reflecting the high regenerative capacity of this tissue. The coincidental expression of 208-kDa embryonic MLCK during early development, in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and cultured cell lines suggests that the functional role of the 208-kDa embryonic MLCK may be to regulate the activity of early developmental or non-muscle forms of myosin. As non-muscle myosin heavy chain isoforms are expressed in many cultured cell lines and early during development, expression of 208-kDa embryonic MLCK in proliferating cultured cells or in differentiating tissues is consistent with the proposal that this form of MLCK has a unique regulatory function for these myosin isoforms. If this is true, then it is plausible that a family of MLCKs exists, each being specialized to regulate the activities either of specific myosin isoforms or specialized myosin motor activities such as assembly/disassembly, contraction, or cytokinesis. Collectively, the immunological and biochemical data presented in this report identify the presence of a previously undetected form of MLCK. We suggest this form of MLCK be called embryonic MLCK because of its detection in undifferentiated stem cells and early embryonic tissues. Expression of embryonic MLCK is down-regulated following birth in most adult tissues, with the predominant form of MLCK in adult tissues being smooth muscle MLCK. It is now apparent the expression of smooth muscle MLCK is not tissue-specific and the expression patterns of both forms of MLCK during development suggest that embryonic MLCK and smooth muscle MLCK are inversely regulated. The pattern of immunoreactivity of embryonic MLCK clearly shows that this form of MLCK is related to but clearly distinct from both the smooth muscle MLCK and the predicted non-muscle MLCK. We thank Loren Field for suggestions and for pregnant mice AT1 and AT2 cells, Fred Pavalko for REF cells and assistance with preadsorption data, and Jim Stull for antibodies to smooth muscle MLCK."

The mechanism of this arrest is of considerable interest. This paper presents experimental evidence in support of four major points pertaining to termination of DNA replication.

Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8778-8784Google Scholar, 23Hidaka M. Kobayashi T. Ishimi Y. Seki M. Enomoto T. Abdel-Monem M. Horiuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5361-5365Google Scholar, 24Baker T.A. Cell. 1995; 80: 521-524Google Scholar). The resolution of the question of helicase specificity of replication terminator proteins has an obvious bearing on the mechanism of the contrahelicase activity. Blocking of many helicases that are involved in other functions such as DNA repair, transcription, conjugative transfer of DNA etc., might imply that the interactions of Ter and RTP with their respective binding sites called τand IR sequences (or BS3) are all that might be necessary to elicit polar impedance of helicase activity. In contrast, helicase-specific block might imply, in addition to DNA-terminator protein interaction, also helicase-terminator protein interaction. The crystal structure of RTP of B. subtilis has been solved at 2.6-Å resolution(25Bussiere D.E. Bastia D. White S. Cell. 1995; 80: 651-660Google Scholar). The protein has a postulated tripartite DNA binding domain that envisages contact with the minor groove of DNA by the N-terminal arm and the β2-β3 pleated sheets and major groove contact by the α3 region of the protein. The crystal structure suggests an exposed hydrophobic patch near the β2-β3 region as a possible surface for interaction with helicases. replication terminator protein single strand DNA binding protein dithiothreitol base pair primosome assembly site. The Ter protein also blocks replication forks of SV40 and antagonizes the helicase activity of the T-antigen(26Bedrosian C. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2618-2622Google Scholar, 27Amin A.A. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18612-18622Google Scholar). We have recently discovered that Ter and RTP interact with DnaB helicase and SV40 T-antigen. 2B. K. Mohanty and D. Bastia, manuscript in preparation. Hiasa and Marians (21Hiasa H. Marians K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11379-11385Google Scholar) have reported that purified Ter, in vitro, can block DnaB translocation but not authentic unwinding of DNA duplex. The implication is that blocking of DNA unwinding requires the participation, along with Ter, of other proteins. Recently, we have discovered that both Ter and RTP are also polar anti-transcriptases and block RNA chain elongation by E. coli, T7, and SP6 RNA polymerases. 3B. K. Mohanty, T. Sahoo, and D. Bastia, manuscript in preparation. The present investigation was mainly driven by the need to answer two questions: (i) are the contrahelicase activities of Ter and RTP helicase-specific? and (ii) do the terminator proteins by themselves, without the assistance of other proteins, block authentic helicase-catalyzed DNA unwinding? In addition to answering the two questions posed above, the results presented in this paper also demonstrate that RTP of Gram-positive B. subtilis, impeded the activity of PriA helicase of Gram-negative E. coli. Furthermore, the PriA-blocking activity of RTP was abrogated by the passage of an RNA transcript through the terminus (BS3)-RTP complex. Ter, DnaB(17Khatri G.S. MacAllister T. Sista P.R. Bastia D. Cell. 1989; 59: 667-674Google Scholar), and RTP (28Mehta P.P. Bussiere D.E. Hoffman D.W. Bastia D. White S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18885-18889Google Scholar) were purified as published. Rep helicase (29Lohman T.M. Chao K. Green J.M. Sage S. Runyon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10139-10147Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Tim Lohman (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Single strand DNA binding protein (SSB) was from a commercial source (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Helicase I was purified according to a modification of a published procedure(30Dash P.K. Traxler B.A. Panicker M.M. Hackney D.D. Minkley E.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1163-1172Google Scholar). The cells(N4830) containing the overproducer plasmid (pMP8) were induced, and the purification was carried out through a DEAE-Sephacel step according to the published procedure. The enzyme was then purified by successive fast flow Q-Sepharose, heparin-agarose and Mono-Q fast protein liquid chromatography close to homogeneity (see Fig. 1). All gradients for the above mentioned steps were from 0 to 0.5 M NaCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. T7 RNA polymerase was purified according to a published protocol(31Grodberg J. Dunn J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1245-1253Google Scholar). The protein fractions were taken through the (NH4)2SO4 precipitation as published. The further purification involved S-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, and a Mono-S step in sequence. PriA was purified from a pET3C-PriA overproducer clone kindly provided by Ken Marians (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY) by a modification of the procedure of Shlomai and Kornberg(35Shlomai J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6789-6793Google Scholar). The cells were harvested and lysed with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% sucrose, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA. The cleared lysate was precipitated with (NH4)2SO4 (0.24 gm/ml). The precipitate was spun down, dissolved in buffer A (25 mM imidazole-Cl, pH 6.8, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 15% glycerol, 50 mM NaCl) and dialyzed against the same buffer. The dialysate was loaded onto a Bio-Rex 70 column equilibrated with buffer A. After washing, the protein was eluted with 10 column volumes of a gradient of 0.05-1 M NaCl in the same buffer. The peak containing PriA (monitored by a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel) was dialyzed against buffer B (25 mM imidazole-Cl, pH 6.8, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 15% glycerol), loaded onto a P11-phosphocellulose column, and washed with buffer B. The protein was eluted with a 0-0.75 M NaCl gradient, and peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C (25 mM imidazole-Cl, pH 6.8, 5 mM potassium phosphate, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 25 mM (NH4)2SO4) and loaded onto a hydroxylapatite column equilibrated with buffer C. The column was washed and eluted with a 20-400 mM linear (NH4)2SO4 gradient in buffer C. The peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer D (25 mM imidazole-Cl pH 6.8, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 25 mM NaCl) onto a Mono-S FPLC column. The protein was eluted with a 0.025-1 M NaCl gradient in buffer D. The PriA thus obtained was >95% pure (Fig. 1). Single-stranded M13 mp18 or mp19 containing the Ter-binding (τ) or RTP-binding (BS3) site in opposite orientations served as the template for preparation of various helicase substrates (diagrammatic representations in the top panel of Figure 4:, Figure 5:, Figure 6:, and 8). Radiolabeled (32P) complementary oligonucleotides (to τ or BS3 site) were annealed to the specific M13τ or M13BS3 single-stranded DNA, and after purifying through Sepharose CL-4B columns were used for standard helicase assays. Substrates containing extended primer across the interstitially located τ or BS3 site were prepared by annealing an 18-mer oligonucleotide about 130 bases downstream of the τ site and extending with Sequenase (modified T7 DNA polymerase, USB) in the presence of [α32P]dATP and ddATP. This provides a mixture of extension products forming heteroduplex regions of varying lengths. For assaying PriA helicase, the recombinant M13 single-stranded DNA was constructed with a primosome assembly site (PAS) downstream of the BS3 site to enable PriA helicase to move in a 3′ → 5′ direction toward the BS3 site. A 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide complementary to the BS3 site was annealed to the specific single-stranded DNA template, and the resulting substrate was used for the helicase assay with PriA. Substrate for T7 RNA polymerase-mediated release of PriA block by RTP was same as that for PriA assay except that a T7 RNA polymerase promoter was cloned upstream of BS3 site oriented such that RNA chain synthesis proceeded toward the BS3 site. The orientation of the BS3 site in this substrate was such that RTP-BS3 complex would block PriA activity but not T7 RNA polymerase movement and RNA chain elongation (Fig. 8, top panel). An oligonucleotide complementary to the BS3 site was annealed to the single-stranded DNA and extended with Sequenase (modified T7 DNA polymerase, U.S. Biochemical Corp.) in the presence of dNTPs, [α-32P]dATP, ddCTP, and ddGTP to give partial duplex substrate of various lengths.Figure 5:Polar blockage of PriA helicase by RTP-BS3 complex. M13 mp18BS3PAS and M13 mp18BS3revPAS with the RTP binding site in opposite orientations with regard to PriA movement were constructed as depicted in panel A. A 53-mer oligonucleotide complementary to the BS3 site with a 3′ overhang was annealed to the single-stranded DNA, and standard helicase assays were performed after binding RTP to the BS3 site.

Indicated amounts of Ter or RTP were added to the substrate and placed on ice (in the case of Ter) or at room temperature (in the case of RTP) for 15-20 min. After adding the helicase (DnaB, Rep, Helicase I, or PriA) the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 min (in case of Helicase I, Rep, and PriA) or 15 min (for DnaB). Reactions were terminated by the addition of dye mixture containing SDS-EDTA-sucrose and bromophenol blue. Analysis was done by electrophoresis through 6-8% polyacrylamide gel in Tris borate-EDTA buffer and autoradiography with Kodak XAR film. The percentage of oligonucleotide released was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis or by Cerenkov counting of radioactivity present in the bands excised from the gel after autoradiography. For PriA helicase assay the reaction mixture contained, in addition to the above components, 0.5 μg of SSB/reaction. Mapping of the minimal effective terminator sequence required for Ter protein to bind and block DnaB-mediated oligo release was done by eluting the released bands in the helicase assay (bracket and arrow in Fig. 6) and resolving it in a sequencing gel alongside a sequence ladder generated by the same oligo single-stranded DNA template. The coupled helicase transcription assay (PriA-T7 RNA polymerase) was carried out in a reaction mixture containing 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 4 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 0.5 mM each of CTP, UTP, GTP, 50 mM potassium glutamate, 5 mM DTT, and 50 μg/ml BSA in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. After incubation of RTP with the heteroduplex substrate at room temperature for 15 min, indicated amounts of T7 RNA polymerase and PriA were added and incubated at 37°C for 20 min. Analysis was done on a 30-cm-long 8% polyacrylamide gel. The experiments described in this section were conducted to answer the following question. Do the terminator proteins act as polar clamps on DNA that block almost any helicase that translocates on DNA, or is the block helicase-specific, implying specific recognition of replicative helicases by both Ter and RTP? Previous work had established the fact that Ter (Tus) protein of E. coli(17Khatri G.S. MacAllister T. Sista P.R. Bastia D. Cell. 1989; 59: 667-674Google Scholar, 18Lee E.H. Kornberg A. Hidaka M. Kobayashi T. Horiuchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9104-9108Google Scholar) and RTP of B. subtilis(19Kaul S. Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Patel I. Khan S.A. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11143-11147Google Scholar, 20Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Patel I. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 619-628Google Scholar) impede the activity of the E. coli replicative helicase, DnaB. We wished to investigate, using a wide range of concentrations of other helicases and the two terminator proteins, whether non-replicative helicases, i.e. Helicase I and Rep helicase, are impeded by RTP and Ter. Non-replicative helicases are helicases that are not involved in Cairns-type or symmetric DNA replication. The purities of the various enzymes and proteins used in the experiments described in this paper are shown in Fig. 1. In the first series of experiments we kept the molar concentration of Rep helicase at 400 fmol (~58 ng) and varied the molar ratios of RTP over the DNA substrate from 40 to 160. DnaB helicase was used as a positive control. The helicase substrate contained the terminus of B. subtilis called BS3 (IRI) in both orientations with respect to the direction of the helicase translocation. The results shown in the autoradiogram and its quantitative analysis (Fig. 2, top) revealed that under the wide range of experimental conditions used, RTP failed to block DNA unwinding by Rep helicase. In contrast DnaB was blocked in a polar fashion (Fig. 2, top left, lanes M and N). Similar experiments performed using Ter protein gave identical results (data not shown). We also performed helicase assays using a fixed amount (100 fmol = 18 ng) of helicase I and a wide range of ratios of Ter to DNA substrate(50-300). The results again showed that helicase I was not impeded by Ter (Fig. 2, lower panel). Similar experiments were also performed with RTP and yielded similar results (data not shown). Thus neither Ter nor RTP impeded the catalytic activity of Helicase I when bound to the respective terminator sequences present in either orientation. In view of the reports in the literature that terminator proteins block many helicases(18Lee E.H. Kornberg A. Hidaka M. Kobayashi T. Horiuchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9104-9108Google Scholar, 24Baker T.A. Cell. 1995; 80: 521-524Google Scholar), we wished to confirm our observations by keeping the concentrations of RTP and Ter constant and changing the ratios of helicase I to the substrate over a wide range. The helicase assays again showed that neither the activity of Rep helicase (molar ratios of 5-40; RTP 40-fold molar excess over DNA substrate) or of helicase I (molar ratio of enzyme over substrate 5-60; RTP present in 40-fold molar excess over substrate) was impeded by RTP (Fig. 3). Similar experiments performed with Ter protein, helicase I, and Rep helicase yielded identical results (data not shown). Thus neither RTP nor Ter were able to impede the catalytic activities of helicase I and Rep helicase over a wide range of experimental conditions. We endeavored to test whether Ter (or RTP) might block the activity of Helicase I on a DNA substrate that had a heteroduplex region of only a certain length. Using an oligonucleotide primer and the circular single-stranded DNA of M13 mp18/19τ we generated a population of DNA substrates that contained various lengths of heteroduplex regions from <100 bp to >2000 bp (Fig. 4, top). We performed helicase assays in the absence and presence of various concentrations of Ter. DnaB helicase was used as a positive control. The results showed that whereas DnaB was impeded in a polar fashion by Ter (Fig. 4, bottom, lanes k and l), the activity of helicase I was not impeded, regardless of the length of the heteroduplexed region present in the substrate (Fig. 4, lanes B-E, and G-J), and in both orientations of the τ sequence. To extend our previous observation that RTP of Gram-positive B. subtilis blocks the replicative helicase DnaB of Gram-negative E. coli(19Kaul S. Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Patel I. Khan S.A. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11143-11147Google Scholar, 20Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Patel I. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 619-628Google Scholar), we wished to test whether RTP also impedes the activity of PriA helicase of E. coli. PriA translocates in a 3′ → 5′ direction on DNA, unlike DnaB that moves in a 5′ → 3′ direction(21Hiasa H. Marians K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11379-11385Google Scholar, 32LeBowitz J. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Google Scholar). We constructed a helicase substrate that had a PAS (Fig. 5A) and the BS3 site in both orientations (BS3 and BS3rev). The helicase assays showed that RTP of B. subtilis failed to block the activity of PriA on the BS3 substrate; DnaB activity in contrast was impeded (Fig. 5B, top). However, in the BS3rev substrate, RTP impeded the helicase activity of PriA but not of DnaB (Fig. 5B, bottom). The quantitation of the autoradiogram shown (in Fig. 5B) is shown in Fig. 5C. Thus a 20-fold molar excess of RTP over DNA substrate was able to block, in a polar fashion, the activity of 40 fmol of PriA. Previous work by Hiasa and Marians (21Hiasa H. Marians K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11379-11385Google Scholar) had suggested that the Ter (Tus) protein, unaided by other replisomal proteins, was able to block DnaB translocation but not authentic unwinding of long stretches of double-stranded DNA (>250 bp). The conclusions of Hiasa and Marians (21Hiasa H. Marians K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11379-11385Google Scholar) were based on the observation that Ter by itself could impede the DnaB-catalyzed unwinding of short DNA duplexes of up to 100 bp but failed to block the unwinding of duplexes over 250 bp and, secondly, that the half-maximal concentration of ATP required for unwinding of short duplexes was the same as that needed for DnaB translocation. In contrast the half-maximal concentration of ATP required for DnaB-catalyzed unwinding was 10-fold more than that needed for enzyme translocation. The implication was that Ter by itself can not block helicase-catalyzed unwinding ahead of a replication fork but needed the assistance of other proteins for this activity. We wished to reexamine this point by constructing helicase substrates that had a wide range of lengths of double-stranded DNA that include the terminus τ in both orientations. We used M13 mp18/19τ, single-stranded DNA circles with a primer that was extended in the presence of a dideoxynuleotide triphosphate (ddNTP) and [α-32P]dATP and T7 DNA polymerase. A set of extension products, ranging in length from ~50 to >1500 nucleotides was thus generated (Fig. 6, top). The two sets of substrates M13 mp18/19τ thus generated were incubated with DnaB and ATP in the absence and presence of a range of concentrations of Ter protein. The results showed that, in the M13 mp18τ substrates, all the extension products that had stopped short of the τ sequence were released by DnaB, whereas all DNA chains that included τ, ranging in length from ~150 to greater than 1500 bp, were blocked from release by DnaB, thus generating a “footprint” of release (Fig. 6, bottom, lanes C-G). In contrast, in the M13 mp19τ substrate, Ter protein was unable, as expected, to block DnaB activity, and a ladder of products from ~50 to >1500 nucleotides were released (Fig. 6, bottom, lanes I-N). These experiments showed that there was no length dependence of Ter in its ability to impede DnaB activity in a polar fashion. Thus, we concluded that Ter protein by itself was capable of impeding both DnaB translocation and duplex unwinding, unaided by any other replisomal proteins. The “helicase activity footprint” described above provided us with an approach to determine the minimum critical nucleotide sequence of τ that, when present in the double-stranded form, could elicit contrahelicase activity of Ter. The experiment described in Fig. 6 was performed separately, using all four ddNTPs, and the regions marked by the bracket (Fig. 6, bottom) were eluted and resolved in a sequencing gel with appropriate sequencing ladder as markers. This experiment allowed us to determine the precise right boundary of a “minimal effective length” of the τ sequence (Fig. 7, top). Thus the extended primer had to copy the critical T residue on the template, thus generating the complementary sequence 5′-ACTTTAGTTACAACATA-3′ to be able to elicit contrahelicase activity. All extension products short of the last A residue failed to elicit contrahelicase activity of the Ter protein (Fig. 7, bottom). We have previously shown that Ter and RTP are also DNA sequence-specific anti-transcriptases, i.e. the proteins are able to block, in a polar fashion, RNA chain elongation by several prokaryotic RNA polymerases.3 We have also shown that the contrahelicase activity of Ter and RTP directed against DnaB, that translocates in a 5′->3′ direction on DNA, is abrogated by an invading RNA transcript.3 We wished to examine if RNA transcription would have the same effect on the ability of RTP to impede a helicase that translocates in the 3′ → 5′ direction, i.e. PriA. We constructed a set of substrates by primer extension on the M13 mp18BS3rev template that included a PAS as shown in Fig. 8(top). The substrate included a T7 promoter capable of directing a RNA transcript clockwise into the BS3rev terminus. The family of partial heteroduplexed substrates was coated with SSB, and helicase assays were performed with purified PriA. The results showed that PriA, in the presence of ATP was able to unwind the DNA, thus releasing a ladder of extension products (Fig. 8, bottom, lanes A and B). RTP blocked the release of the ladder (Fig. 8, bottom, lanes C and D). Turning on the T7 promoter by including T7 RNA polymerase in the reaction mixture abrogated the arrest of PriA at the BS3 site, thus releasing the ladder of extension products (Fig. 8, bottom, lanes E-H). Thus the contrahelicase activity of RTP directed against PriA is abrogated by an invading RNA transcript that propagated through the terminus sequence. Although there is general agreement that Ter imposes a polar block on DnaB-catalyzed DNA unwinding, whether or not Ter is also a general helicase blocker has been a debatable issue(17Khatri G.S. MacAllister T. Sista P.R. Bastia D. Cell. 1989; 59: 667-674Google Scholar, 18Lee E.H. Kornberg A. Hidaka M. Kobayashi T. Horiuchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9104-9108Google Scholar, 21Hiasa H. Marians K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11379-11385Google Scholar, 24Baker T.A. Cell. 1995; 80: 521-524Google Scholar). The resolution of this issue should have significant implications for the understanding of the mechanism by which terminator proteins block replication forks, i.e. a block imposed strictly by terminator protein terminus-DNA interaction versus specific protein-protein interaction between the replicative helicase(s) and the terminator protein. We have critically examined this issue using the replicative primosomal helicase PriA of E. coli and the Rep helicase and Helicase I of E. coli as representatives of non-replicative helicases. Non-replicative helicases implies those that do not participate in symmetric or “Cairns type” DNA replication. It is worth remembering that Helicase I is involved in conjugational DNA transfer, whereas Rep helicase is involved in rolling circle DNA replication of the φX174 family of phages(33Lohman T.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 5-14Google Scholar, 34Matson S.W. Kaiser-Rogers K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 289-329Google Scholar). We have found that RTP of B. subtilis acted as a polar contrahelicase of PriA, thus complementing our earlier results with DnaB of E. coli(19Kaul S. Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Patel I. Khan S.A. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11143-11147Google Scholar, 20Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Patel I. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 619-628Google Scholar). In contrast, we detected no blockage of either Rep or Helicase I by Ter or RTP over a wide range of ~terminator-to-substrate and helicase-to-substrate ratios. Thus we could not confirm an earlier report claiming polar blockage of Helicase I by Ter protein(23Hidaka M. Kobayashi T. Ishimi Y. Seki M. Enomoto T. Abdel-Monem M. Horiuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5361-5365Google Scholar). On the basis of our results reported in this paper, we believe that Ter and RTP are specific contrahelicases of the replicative helicases DnaB and PriA, and in the case of Ter, of T antigen of SV40(23Hidaka M. Kobayashi T. Ishimi Y. Seki M. Enomoto T. Abdel-Monem M. Horiuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5361-5365Google Scholar, 26Bedrosian C. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2618-2622Google Scholar, 27Amin A.A. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18612-18622Google Scholar). Implicit in these results is the idea that the arrest of replication forks at the terminus involves specific interaction between replicative helicase and terminator protein(s). Consistent with this notion is our recent discovery that a point mutation at a residue believed to be in the helicase blocking domain of RTP, as suggested from its crystal structure(25Bussiere D.E. Bastia D. White S. Cell. 1995; 80: 651-660Google Scholar), does not interfere with DNA binding but abolishes the ability of the resultant RTP to block DnaB helicase. 4A. Manna, S. Pai, and D. Bastia, manuscript in preparation. A second issue addressed in this paper is whether Ter, unaided by any other protein, can block authentic, helicase-catalyzed DNA unwinding. Our results conclusively show that over a wide range of 50 to greater than 1500 bp of duplex DNA, DNA unwinding by DnaB is abolished by Ter, thus complementing our earlier results with RTP(20Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Patel I. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 619-628Google Scholar). Thus we were unable to confirm the conclusions of Hiasa and Marians (21Hiasa H. Marians K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11379-11385Google Scholar) that Ter by itself can block helicase translocation but not authentic DNA unwinding. We have reported that invasion of a terminus, in vitro, by an RNA transcript, released arrested PriA helicase. This observation provides further support of our proposition that transcriptional invasion of a replication terminus is detrimental to the termination process. The RNA transcripts are halted before entering the terminus by the RNA chain anti-elongation activity of RTP and Ter3 in a polar fashion. The Ter protein of E. coli and RTP of B. subtilis bear little or no homology in the primary amino acid sequence, yet both proteins block the same replicative helicases of E. coli, namely DnaB and PriA(17Khatri G.S. MacAllister T. Sista P.R. Bastia D. Cell. 1989; 59: 667-674Google Scholar, 19Kaul S. Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Patel I. Khan S.A. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

On the basis of crystallography of RTP and mutational analysis, there are already preliminary indications of the surface of RTP that is involved in helicase blocking.4 Although Ter protein has been refractory to crystallization, mutational analysis of its coding region should enable one to localize the helicase-blocking region of the protein. Future work will be directed at localizing the RNA polymerase-blocking domain on RTP and Ter as well as the interaction surface on DnaB that recognizes Ter and RTP. Such studies should illuminate further the mechanism of replication termination. We thank Drs. Steve Matson and Tim Lohman for initial supplies of Helicase I and Rep helicase, respectively, and for the overproducer strains for these enzymes. We also thank Drs. Ken Marians and Alan Rosenberg for providing us with the overproducer strains for PriA and T7 RNA polymerase, respectively. We thank Ocie Ingram for the preparation of this manuscript."

INTRODUCTIONThe enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT, 1The abbreviations used are: ChATcholine acetyltransferaseChcholinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. EC 2.3.1.6) catalyzes the transfer of the acyl group from acetyl-CoA to choline resulting in the formation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Mechanistic studies on the enzyme suggest a concerted reaction in contrast to similar enzymes that transfer acyl groups via an acyl enzyme intermediate. The kinetic mechanism for the enzyme approximates a Theorell-Chance mechanism(1Tucek S. Whittaker V.P. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 86. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1988: 129-131Google Scholar), although by using isotope exchange at equilibrium a random component in the reaction has been detected(2Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12820-12825Google Scholar). Chemical modification studies have implicated histidine, cysteine, and arginine as active site residues. Thus inactivation studies with dithiobis-4-nitro-2-carboxylate led to the proposal that the enzyme contains an active site cysteine(3Roskoski Jr., R. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2156-2159Google Scholar, 4Roskoski Jr., R. Lim C.T. Roskoski L.M. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5105-5110Google Scholar, 5Driskell W.J. Weber B.H. Roberts E. J.

Bull. 1990; 24: 119-124Google Scholar); however, modification of this residue by methylation showed it is not essential for catalysis(8Hersh L.B. Nair R.V. Smith D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11988-11992Google Scholar). Similarly, an active site histidine was implicated by inactivation studies with diethylpyrocarbonate while an active site arginine was implicated by inactivation studies with phenylglyoxal(7Carbini L. Rodriguez G. Hersh L.B. Brain Res. Bull. 1990; 24: 119-124Google Scholar, 9Mautner H.G. Pakula A.A. Merrill R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7449-7452Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the active site histidine serves as a general acid/base catalyst(10Currier S.F. Mautner H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3355-3358Google Scholar), while the active site arginine is postulated to be involved in binding interactions with the 3′-phosphate of the substrate CoA(9Mautner H.G. Pakula A.A. Merrill R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7449-7452Google Scholar).With the availability of cDNA clones for ChAT from Drosophila melanogaster(11Itoh N. Slemmon J.R. Hawke D.H. Williamson R. Morita E. Itakura K. Roberts E. Shively J.E. Crawford G.D. Salvaterra P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4081-4085Google Scholar), porcine spinal cord(12Berrard S. Brice A. Lottspeich F. Braun A. Barde Y.A. Mallet J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 9280-9284Google Scholar), rat brain(13Brice A. Berrard S. Raynaud B. Ansieau S. Coppola T. Weber M.J. Mallet J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 23: 266-273Google Scholar, 14Ishii K. Oda Y. Ichikawa T. Deguchi T. Mol. Brain Res. 1990; 7: 151-159Google Scholar), mouse brain(14Ishii K. Oda Y. Ichikawa T. Deguchi T. Mol. Brain Res. 1990; 7: 151-159Google Scholar), and Caenorhabditis elegans(15Alfonso A. Grundahl K. McManus J.R. Rand J.B. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2290-2300Google Scholar) it has now become possible to use site-directed mutagenesis to identify these active site residues and to study their function. We have previously used site-directed mutagenesis to analyze the functionality of three conserved histidines in Drosophila ChAT and have shown that one of these residues, His-426, is essential for catalysis(16Carbini L.A. Hersh L.B. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 247-253Google Scholar). We have now used a similar approach to search for the active site arginine thought to be involved in coenzyme A binding. Seven conserved arginines were individually changed to alanine and the resultant mutants characterized. The properties of mutant enzymes containing substitutions at arginine 452 are consistent with this arginine serving as an active site residue.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsCitrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase, both from pig heart, were obtained from Sigma. Ni-nitriloacetate-agarose was obtained from Qiagen, while Immobilon-P nylon membranes were obtained from Millipore Corp. A rabbit anti-human ChAT antiserum prepared as described previously was employed for Western blot analyses. Alkaline phosphatase conjugated to goat anti-rabbit IgG was obtained from Bio-Rad.Site-directed MutagenesisOligonucleotide-directed mismatch mutagenesis was performed by the “dual primer” method of Zoller and Smith(17Zoller M.J. Smith M. DNA. 1984; 3: 479-484Google Scholar). The conserved arginine residues and the changes that were made in them are listed in Table 1. The mutated cDNA fragments were inserted into the expression vector pQE9 as described(18Wu D. Ahmed S.N. Lian W. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19395-19401Google Scholar), and final confirmation of the nucleotide changes in the clones was achieved by dideoxy chain-terminating DNA sequencing using Sequenase version 2.0 from U. S. Biochemical Corp.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of Recombinant ChATEscherichia coli SG12036 expressing recombinant rat ChAT was grown at 22°C for 4 days in LB media. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen at -80°C until further use. Enzyme purification was achieved as described previously(18Wu D. Ahmed S.N. Lian W. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19395-19401Google Scholar). This procedure involves application of an E. coli extract, prepared in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing the recombinant enzyme on a column of Ni-nitriloacetate-agarose equilibrated with the extraction buffer. The column is washed batchwise with buffer containing increasing concentrations of NaCl from 0 to 2 M and lastly with buffer containing 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.4. The enzyme, eluted with an imidazole gradient from 5 to 150 mM, was applied to a column of blue-agarose (Amicon), previously equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6. After washing the column with equilibration buffer, the enzyme was eluted with a linear salt gradient from 0 to 1 M and concentrated/dialyzed in a Centricon 30 concentrator (Amicon). The purified enzyme was either used immediately or stored at -80°C in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 40% of glycerol.Assay of ChAT ActivityEnzymatic activity was determined by the fluorometric assay of Hersh et al.(19Hersh L.B. Coe B. Casey L. J. Neurochem. 1978; 30: 1077-1085Google Scholar). This assay involves coupling the reverse ChAT reaction (CoA + AcCh → AcCoA + Ch) to citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase. Assays conducted under high salt conditions contained 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 250 mM sodium chloride, 0.125 mM NAD, 0.5 mML-malate, 0.1 mMDL-dithiothreitol, 1.5 units of pig heart citrate synthase, 4 units of pig heart malate dehydrogenase, and variable levels of acetylcholine chloride and CoA. For routine assays 25 mM acetylcholine chloride and 0.1 mM CoA were used. Reactions were initiated by the addition of acetylcholine chloride, and NADH formation was monitored continuously using an Optical Technologies fluorometer. Assays conducted under low salt conditions were identical except that NaCl was omitted from the reaction.Characterization of Purified ChATEnzyme purity was monitored by SDS-PAGE(20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), with the protein stained by the alkaline silver staining procedure(21Switzer R.C. Merril C.R. Shifrin S. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 231-237Google Scholar). The concentration of purified ChAT was determined by the Bradford method (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. For R250A, Western blot analysis was used to quantitate the amount of enzyme using known amounts of purified wild type enzyme as a standard. Briefly, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to an Immobilon-P nylon membrane as described by Towbin et al.(23Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). After transfer, the membranes were incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride, 5% nonfat dry milk, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40) and then overnight with affinity-purified anti-ChAT antibodies, diluted into fresh blocking buffer. The following morning the membrane was washed three times with 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.25% sodium 7-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, followed by another three washes with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 150 mM NaCl. To visualize the immunoreactive protein a goat anti-rabbit antiserum coupled with alkaline phosphatase was employed. 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate coupled with p-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride were used as the color reagents.Determination of Kinetic ConstantsPreliminary estimates of the Km values for CoA, dephospho-CoA, and acetylcholine were made with each mutant at substrate concentrations saturating (10 × Km) for the wild type enzyme. Where the Km appeared higher than the wild type enzyme, the kinetic measurements were redetermined at a higher fixed substrate concentration to ensure saturation. This protocol could not be used for determining the Km of CoA and dephospho-CoA under low salt conditions with the R452A mutant since the concentration of acetylcholine, used as its chloride salt, needed to achieve a saturating level would have raised the anion concentration into the range used at high salt. Thus to determine the Km for CoA and dephospho-CoA with this mutant under low salt conditions, the concentration of acetylcholine was varied at fixed variable levels of CoA or dephospho-CoA, maintaining the concentration of acetylcholine below 10 mM. The data were then replotted as 1/Vmax (equivalent to an infinite acetylcholine concentration) versus 1/CoA (or dephospho-CoA). Kinetic constants were determined by fitting the data to the weighted least squares kinetic programs of Cleland. The same Vmax was obtained with either substrate indicating saturation was indeed achieved.Chemical Modification of ChAT by PhenylglyoxalEnzyme was incubated at 37°C with 5 mM phenylglyoxal in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.25 M NaCl and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction was initiated by the addition of phenylglyoxal, and aliquots of 6 μl were withdrawn at various times and added to an assay mixture containing 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 10 mM choline iodide, and 10 mM radiolabeled acetyl-CoA in a total volume of 50 μl. Acetylcholine formation was measured by the method of Fonnum (24Fonnum F. J. Neurochem. 1975; 24: 407-409Google Scholar).Heat Inactivation of ChAT and Substrate ProtectionEnzyme was incubated at the desired temperature in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, in the presence or absence of CoA at the indicated concentration. Aliquots were withdrawn at various times, diluted with an equal volume of ice-cold 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The samples were maintained on ice until assayed by the standard fluorometric assay.RESULTSPrevious studies have implicated an active site arginine residue to be involved in the binding of coenzyme A to the enzyme ChAT. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of ChAT from rat, Drosophila, and C. elegans, deduced from their respective cDNAs, revealed seven potential conserved arginines (Table 1). In order to determine which, if any, are involved in coenzyme binding we utilized a rat ChAT cDNA and alanine scanning in which each of these putative active site arginines was separately changed to an alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. Each cDNA was constructed in an expression vector containing an N-terminal hexahistidine fused to the ChAT protein. Previous studies (18Wu D. Ahmed S.N. Lian W. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19395-19401Google Scholar) have established that this modification has no effect on the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Expression of the recombinant enzymes in E. coli, in all but one case, led to their facile purification by a two-step procedure involving metal affinity chromatography followed by dye binding chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Fig. 1 shows representative preparations of the purified enzymes in which it can be seen that essentially homogeneous enzyme is obtained. In one case, the conversion of arginine 99 to alanine resulted in low levels of expression of this mutant, and difficulties were subsequently encountered in purifying this recombinant protein. Therefore, the properties of this mutant were analyzed in E. coli extracts rather than with purified enzyme.The kinetic properties of the mutant enzymes were initially compared with the wild type enzyme in the presence of 0.25 M NaCl, conditions previously shown to give maximal activity(25Hersh L.B. Peet M. J. Neurochem. 1978; 30: 1087-1093Google Scholar). The results of this kinetic analysis are summarized in Table 2. Comparing the various alanine substitutions, the most significant effect observed is with the mutant R452A in which the Km for CoA increases more than 12-fold, the Km for acetylcholine increases ~8-fold, and kcat increases ~7-fold. Smaller increases in the Km for CoA and acetylcholine were observed with the mutants R453A, R458A, and R463A. These studies were further extended by replacing arginine 452 with glutamine, which is a near isosteric replacement, and also with glutamate, which produces a reversal in charge at this position. The kinetic properties of the R452Q mutant were essentially the same as the R452A mutant, while the R452E mutant showed greater increases in the Km for CoA (54-fold), the Km for acetylcholine (60-fold), and kcat (~15-fold) (Table 2). We also tested the effect of charge reversal on the adjacent arginine, arginine 453, and the effect of replacing both arginines 452 and 453 with glutamine. Charge reversal at position 453 produced an enzyme form similar to R452A or R452Q, while replacing both arginines produced an enzyme form in which the Km for CoA increased more than 170-fold, the Km for acetylcholine increased ~70-fold, and kcat increased ~17-fold.TABLE II Open table in a new tab Since it has been proposed that an active site arginine functions to interact with the 3′-phosphate of coenzyme A(9Mautner H.G. Pakula A.A. Merrill R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7449-7452Google Scholar), the effect of each mutation with dephospho-CoA as substrate was examined, since no such interaction should occur with this substrate. With the wild type enzyme dephospho-CoA exhibits a Km that is ~10-fold higher than coenzyme A (Table 2). In each of the mutants the Km for dephospho-CoA was similar to that obtained with the wild type enzyme, this being particularly notable with R452E and R452Q/R453Q in which the Km for dephospho-CoA increased less than 4-fold as compared with changes in the Km for CoA ~of more than 50-fold for these mutants. Thus at this initial level of analysis Arg-452 appears to be a likely candidate as an active site residue, with arginines 453, 458, and 463 also being possible candidates.It has been previously observed that anions affect the kinetic parameters of the ChAT reaction(26Rossier J. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1977; 20: 284-337Google Scholar). That is, anions act to increase Vmax but at the same time increase the Km for both substrates(25Hersh L.B. Peet M. J. Neurochem. 1978; 30: 1087-1093Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this effect can be attributed, at least in part, to anions interfering with the binding of the 3′-phosphate of coenzyme A to an active site arginine(9Mautner H.G. Pakula A.A. Merrill R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7449-7452Google Scholar). Thus a similar kinetic analysis was conducted with the wild type enzyme and the four candidate active site arginine mutants under conditions of low ionic strength. The results of this analysis are shown in Table 3. In agreement with previous studies(25Hersh L.B. Peet M. J. Neurochem. 1978; 30: 1087-1093Google Scholar, 26Rossier J. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1977; 20: 284-337Google Scholar), it can be seen that with the wild type enzyme decreasing the anion concentration decreases the Km for CoA 12-fold but decreases the Km for choline less than 3-fold and lowers kcat by approximately 2-fold. In contrast decreasing salt has little effect on the Km for dephospho-CoA, a finding consistent with the proposal that anions compete for the interaction at the 3′-phosphate of coenzyme A with an arginine.TABLE III Open table in a new tab The effects of decreased ionic strength are different with the R452A mutant. The Km for CoA is reduced only ~3-fold by lowering the ionic strength of the assay, while there is little change in the Km for acetylcholine and kcat is essentially unchanged. As with the wild type enzyme the Km for dephospho-CoA is barely affected by changes in anion concentration. The other putative active site arginine mutants all exhibit changes in their kinetic properties that are similar to those observed with the wild type enzyme except that kcat remained unchanged. Again these results are consistent with arginine 452 as the active site arginine interacting with CoA.In order to test for a change in kinetic mechanism between the wild type enzyme and the R452A mutant we determined the inhibition pattern with choline as a product inhibitor. The ChAT reaction follows primarily a Theorell-Chance kinetic mechanism, characterized by competitive inhibition between the inner substrate pair choline and acetylcholine(25Hersh L.B. Peet M. J. Neurochem. 1978; 30: 1087-1093Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, choline acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to acetylcholine for both the wild type enzyme and for the R452A mutant, a finding suggesting that both enzymes exhibit the same Theorell-Chance kinetic mechanism. However, the Ki for choline was greater for the mutant (1.1 mM) as compared with the wild type enzyme (0.1 mM). Although not shown, competitive inhibition between choline and acetylcholine was also observed with the most severely affected mutant R452Q/R453Q with the Ki for choline increased to 12 mM.Figure 2:Choline as a competitive inhibitor of wild type ChAT and R452A. Choline inhibition was determined by the fluorometric assay in the presence of 0.25 M NaCl, variable acetylcholine, and a fixed level of CoA (2 × Km(CoA)). Data were plotted as 1/v versus 1/[AcCh]. Ki was calculated from the equation for a competitive inhibitor, v = Vmax (Km/[AcCh]{1 + [I]/Ki} + 1). Choline inhibition of wild type enzyme: ■, no added choline; □, 0.1 mM choline; •, 0.3 mM choline. Choline inhibition of R452A mutant: ■, no added choline; □, 1.0 mM choline; •, 3.0 mM choline.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next analyzed the ability of each of the alanine mutants to react with the arginine-specific reagent phenylglyoxal. As shown in Fig. 3 treatment of the wild type enzyme with 5 mM phenylglyoxal results in biphasic inactivation. There is a rapid initial decline of activity, which is too fast to measure but which results in a loss of ~35% enzyme activity. This is followed by a slower loss in enzyme activity, which plateaus at ~90% inactivation. A replot of the data as log (% activity remaining) versus time from 0.1 to 45 min is linear assuming an end point of 90% inactivation. From this analysis a half-time of ~11 min was obtained. As shown in Fig. 3 the slow phase of inactivation was prevented by inclusion of acetyl-CoA in the inactivation reaction at a concentration in the range of the Km for CoA. Acetylcholine was without effect. Inclusion of acetyl-CoA at concentrations greater than 50 times the Km for CoA had no effect on the fast phase (data not shown). Conversion of arginines 99, 312, and 453 to alanine had no significant effect on phenylglyoxal inactivation. In each of these cases the same extent of enzyme inactivation was observed in the rapid phase, and the half-time for the slow phase varied only slightly from that observed with the wild type enzyme (10, 12, and 10 min for alanine substitutions at arginines 99, 312, and 453, respectively).Figure 3:Phenylglyoxal inactivation of wild type and Arg → Ala mutants of rat ChAT. Phenylglyoxal inactivation was conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence of 5 mM phenylglyoxal and when added acetylcholine or acetyl-CoA. In each case inactivation in the presence of 5 mM phenylglyoxal is designated as the open square while the control incubation in the absence of phenylglyoxal is given by the filled square. Upper left panel, inactivation of wild type enzyme as noted and in the presence of 1.8 mM acetylcholine (•) or 0.5 μM acetyl-CoA (▵); upper right panel, inactivation of R250A; lower left panel, inactivation of R452A as noted and in the presence of 0.5 μM acetyl-CoA (▵) or 13.6 μM acetyl-CoA (▲); lower right panel, inactivation of R463A as noted and in the presence of 2.5 μM acetyl-CoA (▲).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Changing arginine 452 to alanine resulted in a biphasic inactivation curve similar to the wild type enzyme except that the secondary phase was faster (t0.5~7 min) and inactivation went to completion Fig. 3. Acetyl-CoA at the same concentration used to protect the wild type enzyme from inactivation was ineffective with this mutant; however, increasing the acetyl-CoA concentration to 13.6 μM was able to afford protection (Fig. 3). Although not shown, acetylcholine at 15 mM had no effect on phenylglyoxal inactivation.Changing arginine 463 to Ala resulted in a considerably more rapid rate of inactivation by phenylglyoxal (Fig. 3). In this case the initial rapid and secondary phases of the reaction could not be distinguished. However, using 2.5 μM acetyl-CoA to protect against inactivation, the biphasic nature of the inactivation process became apparent (Fig. 3). Changing Arg-250 to Ala totally eliminated the secondary phase of inactivation by phenylglyoxal (Fig. 3).In order to provide additional evidence that Arg-452 is involved in CoA binding, we measured the ability of coenzyme A to protect the enzyme against thermal inactivation. The wild type enzyme is inactivated at 48°C under low ionic strength conditions with a t0.5 of 60 s. As shown in Fig. 4, CoA afforded partial protection against thermal inactivation exhibiting a Kd value of ~0.4 μM, a value similar to the kinetic Km of 0.25 μM listed in Table 2. The R452A mutant was more thermolabile being inactivated at 48°C with a t0.5 of ~20 s. At 44°C the t0.5 was 35 s, and CoA also provided partial protection against thermal inactivation; however, in this case the estimated binding constant was shifted to ~6 μM.Figure 4:CoA protection of thermal inactivation of wild type ChAT and R452A.

Pakula A.A. Merrill R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7449-7452Google Scholar). This observation, in conjunction with the results of kinetic studies which showed that dephospho-coenzyme A was poorly bound by the enzyme(6Hersh L.B. J. Neurochem. 1979; 32: 991-996Google Scholar), led to the proposal of an active site arginine that interacts with the 3′-phosphate of coenzyme A. Since the results of chemical modification experiments are often equivocal or ambiguous, we utilized alanine scanning to systematically search for this active site arginine by replacing seven conserved arginines with alanine. The results of the kinetic analysis of these mutant enzymes are consistent with arginine 452 being the likely candidate. The predicted properties of such a mutant would include a decreased affinity for CoA with little change in the affinity of the mutant for dephospho-CoA. In accordance with this predicted behavior conversion of arginine 452 to alanine, glutamine, or even glutamate caused a 12-50-fold increase in the Km for CoA but less than a 3-fold change in the Km for dephospho-CoA. Thus in contrast to the wild type enzyme, where the Km for CoA is ~10-fold lower than the Km for dephospho-CoA, the Km values for CoA and dephospho-CoA are nearly the same in R452A and R452Q. With R452E dephospho-CoA becomes a better substrate than CoA. The observation that the properties of R452A and R452Q are quite similar rules out any complications that might have been introduced as a result of a change in the side chain volume when substituting the non-isosteric alanine for arginine. Thus this data is consistent with arginine 452 interacting with the 3′-phosphate of coenzyme A. The effects of changing arginine 452 by mutagenesis may be blunted by the presence of an adjacent arginine in position 453. Arginine 453 may also be directly involving in coenzyme binding or alternatively may realign in the Arg-452 mutants so that it can participate in coenzyme binding. This might explain why the most dramatic effects are seen with the R452Q/R453Q double mutant in which both arginines have been substituted.At first glance it might seem surprising that the Km for both CoA and choline as well as kcat would be increased by mutations at position 452. In the Theorell-Chance kinetic mechanism, which the Arg-452 mutant appears to obey, the rate-limiting step in the reaction is the release of product from the enzyme, k5 in Fig. S1. The Km values for coenzyme A and acetylcholine reflect their respective affinity in the steady state and are defined as the ratio of k5/k1 and k5/k3, respectively. The data are consistent with mutations at Arg-452 decreasing the affinity of the enzyme for CoA (or acetyl-CoA) by loss of the interaction with the 3′-phosphate. Kinetically this is manifested as an increase in the rate constant k5 (kcat), which represents dissociation of the coenzyme from the enzyme. An increase in k5 would also be expected to result in an increase in Km(acetylcholine) since this kinetic constant is directly proportional to k5. With R452A and R452Q there is a constant 7-12-fold increase in kcat, Km(acetylcholine), and Km(CoA), a f"

https://openalex.org/W1984420130,"α1-Antitrypsin (α1-AT) is one of the major proteinase inhibitors in serum. Its primary physiological function is to inhibit neutrophil elastase activity in lung, but it also inhibits other serine proteases including trypsin, chymotrypsin, thrombin, and cathepsin. We have previously reported a novel α1-AT, S-2 isoform, from rabbit that is induced up to 100-fold in the liver during acute inflammatory condition (Ray, B. K., Gao, X., and Ray, A.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 22080-22086). Here, we present evidence that the expression of this α1-AT S-2 gene is also induced in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated peripheral blood monocytes. From the cloned genomic DNA, we have identified a distal LPS-responsive enhancer located between -2438 and -1990 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. In vitro DNA-binding studies demonstrated an interaction of an LPS-inducible NF-κB-like nuclear factor with a κB-element present in this enhancer region. Antibodies against p65 and p50 subunits of NF-κB supershifted the DNA-protein complex. A mutation of the NF-κB-binding element virtually abolished the LPS-responsive induction of the chimeric promoter in monocytic cells. Furthermore, overexpression of NF-κB induced the wild-type promoter activity. Taken together, these results demonstrated that during LPS-mediated inflammation, NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors play a crucial role in the transcriptional induction of the inflammation responsive α1-AT gene. α1-Antitrypsin (α1-AT) is one of the major proteinase inhibitors in serum.

The importance of this particular function was first proposed by Laurell and Eriksson(1963), after observing that genetically α1-AT-deficient individuals often develop either a degenerative lung disease early in life (Eriksson, 1964) or a liver disease (Sharp et al., 1969). Genetic α1-AT deficiency seems to affect 1 in 2000 Europeans and is manifested by emphysema in adults and liver disease in children. The genetic variants associated with the deficiency of α1-AT are termed as Psi, Pzi and Pnulli. Individuals homozygous for the Psi allele exhibit a deficiency level of 60%; those homozygous for the Pzi allele exhibit 10-15% deficiency; and Pnulli individuals show almost no detectable amount of α1-AT in their serum (Gitlin and Gitlin, 1975; Allen et al., 1974; Muensch et al., 1986). Increased expression of α1-AT also have clinical importance in the case of individuals carrying Pzzi α1-AT mutant allele. A glutamate to lysine substitution at position 342 (Nukiwa et al., 1987; Sifers et al., 1988) results in aggregation of the mutant α1-AT protein within the rough endoplasmic reticulum (Lomas et al., 1992) of hepatocytes and forms insoluble intracellular inclusions which lead to the hepatocellular damage in these patients. There is now strong evidence that the liver disease of the Pzzi homozygotes is a direct consequence of α1-AT accumulation and degradation in the hepatocyte (Carlson et al., 1988). Since inflammatory condition increases the synthesis of α1-AT protein severalfold, prevention of inflammation and pyrexia could considerably lower the accumulation of the defective protein in the liver of a homozygous Pzzi patient. α1-antitrypsin base pair(s) kilobase pair(s) lipopolysaccharide chloramphenicol acetyltransferase electromobility shift assay interleukin IL-1β-converting enzyme. α1-AT is primarily synthesized in the liver (Laurell and Jeppsson, 1975), to a lesser extent in bronchoalveolar and breast milk macrophages, and in blood monocytes (Perlmutter et al., 1985). It is also reportedly expressed at lower levels in submandibular glands (Chao et al., 1990), renal tubular epithelial cells, intestinal epithelial cells, nonparietal cells of gastric mucosa, and pancreatic islet cells (Carlson et al., 1988; Kelsey et al., 1987; Koopman et al., 1989). The plasma level of α1-AT in a variety of species is normally 2-4 mg/ml, but levels increase 3-4-fold under inflammatory conditions, pregnancy, and after administration of synthetic androgen danazol (Laurell and Rannevik, 1979). Due to the clinical importance, molecular basis of the regulation of α1-AT gene expression has been intensively studied. The minimal promoter element required for liver specific basal expression of human α1-AT gene was reported to be confined within 261 nucleotides from the transcription start site (Cilliberto et al., 1985; DeSimone et al., 1987). But the mouse α1-AT gene which is structurally similar to the human gene requires 500 bases upstream of the transcription start site for its maximal basal expression (Grayson et al., 1988). The difference between the enhancers of these two genes is very surprising. Also, the presence of negative elements that are active in liver cells is reported for both human (DeSimone and Cortese, 1989) and mouse α1-AT genes (Montgomery et al., 1990). Despite numerous reports on α1-AT promoter and its liver-specific expression, very little is known regarding the mechanisms or regulatory elements that control inducible expression of α1-AT during inflammatory condition. It is only known that, in liver, α1-AT is induced by IL-6, whereas in monocytes and macrophages it is induced by both IL-6 and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (Perlmutter et al., 1989; Barbey-Morrel et al., 1987). During IL-6-induced expression, human α1-AT promoter utilizes a distal transcriptional initiation site located about 2 kb upstream of the hepatocyte-specific transcription start site (Hafeez et al., 1992). A lack of reports on the mechanisms of the inducible expression of α1-AT is possibly due to its moderate level of induction which makes it less conducive for such regulation studies. Our recent studies have identified a highly inducible isoform of α1-AT in rabbit whose expression is increased about 100-fold in response to inflammatory signals (Ray et al., 1994). Rabbit genome contains multiple α1-AT genes that are significantly different in terms of their expression under inflammatory condition. In response to inflammation, the mRNA level of the two members of this family, F and S-1, increases nominally (1.5-fold), whereas expression of the S-2 isoform increases about 100-fold. Thus S-2 isoform becomes a major component of α1-AT in the rabbit under inflammatory conditions (Ray et al., 1994). We have therefore initiated a study to understand the regulation of the inducible expression of the rabbit gene as a prelude to the establishment of a rabbit model system to study the pathology associated with the overexpression and deficiency of α1-AT. To identify the elements required for transcriptional induction of the rabbit α1-AT S-2 gene, we performed a detailed analysis of the S-2 promoter region. In this report, we show that a distal region located about 2.5 kb upstream of the transcription start site confers the LPS inducibility to the S-2 promoter. We have identified one NF-κB-like-binding element (Sen and Baltimore, 1986) at this region. Mutation of the NF-κB site virtually eliminates LPS responsiveness in a reporter construct containing the rabbit S-2 upstream promoter. Further characterization showed that several members of the NF-κB family can bind to this NF-κB enhancer motif. Also, cotransfection of NF-κB induces expression of the reporter CAT construct. These results provide strong evidence that NF-κB might be involved as a major regulator in the induction of α1-AT gene brought about by LPS-mediated inflammation. Rabbit peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from citrated blood obtained from normal healthy male New Zealand white rabbits. The citrated blood was centrifuged at 300 × g for 20 min and 800 × g for another 20 min to sediment the cells. The buffy coat layer was removed and washed three times by centrifugation using RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with L-glutamine and gentamycin (50 μg/ml). Washed mononuclear cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium plus 5% heat-inactivated serum and allowed to adhere at 37°C for 2 h. Next, the nonadherent cells were removed by vigorous washing with warm RPMI 1640 medium. The adherent cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated serum at 37°C, 5% CO2. For LPS stimulation, the cells were treated with 10 μg of LPS/ml of medium at 37°C, 5% CO2 for different times as indicated in the text and figure legends. Total RNA was isolated from uninduced and 5-h LPS-induced blood monocyte cells as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi(1987). Fifty micrograms of total RNA were fractionated on a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 M formaldehyde and transferred onto a nylon membrane. Hybridization was carried out using a 32P-labeled rabbit α1-AT S-2 cDNA as probe. Ten micrograms of total RNA isolated from uninduced and LPS-induced monocytes were incubated with a molar excess of 5′-end-labeled antisense S-2-specific oligonucleotide in 40 μl of hybridization buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 80% formamide) at 75°C for 15 min (Sambrook et al., 1989). The sequence of the S-2 antisense oligonucleotide is 5′-GGGCATAGAATAGAGTAC-3′, as described previously (Ray et al., 1994). Next, the tubes were transferred quickly to a water bath set at 50°C and incubated overnight. Annealed RNA and oligonucleotide was precipitated with ethanol and 0.1 volume of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.5. The pellet was washed twice with 80% ethanol and vacuum dried. The dried pellet was dissolved in 10 μl of S1 nuclease buffer (300 mM NaCl, 60 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 3.4 mM ZnCl2, 2 μg of carrier DNA) and incubated at 15°C in the presence of 1.2 units of S1 nuclease. The optimum concentration of S1 nuclease and time of incubation were determined by initial pilot experiments. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 mM EDTA and 5 μl of loading buffer containing 8 M urea. After heating at 75°C for 5 min, the reaction mixture was electrophoresed in a 10% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea sequencing gel. A rabbit liver λEMBL3 genomic library (Ray and Ray, 1991) was screened by the hybridization technique using a radiolabeled probe consisting of the cDNA sequence of rabbit α1-AT S-2 protein. Five independent positive clones were identified using this probe. In order to determine which of these five clones contains the S-2-specific genomic sequence, first DNA fragments carrying the reactive center regions of all five clones were identified by hybridization analysis and were subsequently cloned. The DNA sequence of S-2 isoform in this region is unique and distinguishable from the other isoforms (Ray et al., 1994). From sequence analysis using a primer downstream of the reactive center region, the right genomic clone containing the S-2 gene sequence was identified. Next, a restriction map of the S-2 genomic clone was generated by single and double digests with various restriction enzymes and Southern hybridization. Regions of phage DNA spanning the α1-AT gene were subcloned and sequenced by dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (Sanger et al., 1977) using a Sequenase sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Nuclear extracts were prepared from uninduced and 4-h LPS (10 μg/ml)-induced blood monocytes by following the method of Dignam et al.(1983). Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Bradford(1976). DNA-binding assays were carried out following a standard protocol described earlier (Ray and Ray, 1994). The labeling of DNA probe, containing sequences from -2295 to -2250 of α1-AT S-2 gene, was performed by filling in the overhangs at the termini by Klenow enzyme and [α-32P]dATP. In some binding assays, competitor oligonucleotides were added in the reaction mixture prior to the addition of the radiolabeled probe. For antibody interaction studies, a mixture of anti-p50 and anti-p65 NF-κB proteins were added prior to the addition of the probe. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved in 6% native polyacrylamide gels. A palindromic NF-κB oligonucleotide sequence used as a competitor in EMSA is 5′-GATCCATGGGGAATTCCCCATG-3′. For self-annealing, the oligonucleotide was heated at 95°C for 2 min in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 60 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature for 2-3 h. A mutant NF-κB oligonucleotide was also used as a competitor in EMSA, and its sequence is 5′-GATCCATCTCGAATTCGAGATG-3′. Underlined bases represent mutated sequences. pAT-3.5 CAT plasmid was prepared by ligating the 5′-flanking and exon 1 sequence (from positions -3.5 kb to +70) of the rabbit α1-AT S-2 gene into a promoterless plasmid vector pBLCAT3 (Luckow and Schutz, 1987). Several deletion constructs containing the α1-AT S-2 gene promoter sequences from -2438 to +70, -1990 to +70, and -619 to +70 were also cloned into a pBLCAT3 vector. A plasmid with a mutated NF-κB-binding site, located between bp -2287 and -2276, was created by site-directed mutagenesis (using a kit from Promega) of the wild-type α1-AT S-2 (-2438/+70) CAT plasmid. The sequence of the mutated NF-κB element is 5′-GAGCTCCTTTCGAG-3′, where underlined bases represent mutated sequences. The resulting constructs were analyzed by DNA sequencing to determine the orientation and authenticity of the insert DNAs. The BNL liver cell (BNL CL.2) used in the transfection assays (ATCC TIB73) is a normal embryonic liver cell line. These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing a high level of glucose (4.5 g/liter) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Ten μg of reporter plasmid were used in each transfection assay, with 2 μg of pSV-β-gal plasmid (Promega) as a control for measuring transfection efficiency. In cotransfection experiments, various amounts of CMV-p65 and CMV-p50 plasmid DNAs were added (indicated in figure legends) together with reporter plasmid DNAs and carrier plasmid DNA so that the total amount of DNA in each transfection assay remained constant. Transfection of liver cells was carried out by the calcium phosphate method (Graham and Van der Eb, 1973) with minor modifications as described in Ray and Ray(1994). Monocytes used in transfection assays were prepared from rabbit peripheral blood as described above. Monocytes were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method (Sambrook et al., 1989). For LPS-stimulation of transfected monocytes, cells were incubated in the presence of 10 μg/ml Escherichia coli LPS (Sigma). As a measure of monitoring transfection efficiency, cells were cotransfected with pSV-β galactosidase (Promega) plasmid. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) was assayed (Sambrook et al., 1989) using β-galactosidase-equivalent amounts of cell extracts which were heated at 60°C for 10 min to inactivate endogenous acetylase. All transfections were repeated at least three times. Earlier studies showed that the α1-AT S-2 gene is highly induced in acute phase liver (Ray et al., 1994). To examine, if expression of S-2 gene is also induced in monocyte cells, we used Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA isolated from peripheral blood monocytes following 5 h of LPS stimulation. Results in Fig. 1A demonstrate that LPS mediates an increase in α1-AT gene expression in peripheral blood monocytes. To determine specifically the expression of the S-2 isoform of α1-AT genes, we performed S1 nuclease analysis (Fig. 1B). An antisense 18-mer oligonucleotide specific to the reactive center region of S-2 isoform was 32P-labeled at the 5′ end by [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Molar excess of this oligonucleotide was hybridized with total cellular RNA prepared from normal and LPS-induced blood monocytes. After hybridization, the RNA-oligonucleotide duplex was briefly digested with S1 nuclease and electrophoresed in a sequencing polyacrylamide gel in which the protected duplex fragment migrates slower than the digested oligonucleotide probe. It is evident that expression of the S-2 gene is significantly induced in monocyte cells in response to LPS treatment (compare lanes 3 and 4). The control reaction using yeast tRNA (lane 1) indicated absence of any nonspecific hybridization demonstrating the specificity of this assay. To understand the mechanism of induction of this protein, we undertook the cloning and characterization of the rabbit α1-AT S-2 gene. Using a rabbit α1-AT cDNA as probe for screening of a λEMBL3 rabbit genomic library, five independent hybridizing clones were detected. Previous studies (Ray et al., 1994) indicated that in rabbit at least three isoforms of α1-AT gene exist. In order to know which of these five genomic clones code for the highly inducible S-2 isoform, we used the following strategy. Although the overall cDNA sequences of the three α1-AT isoforms are 96% homologous, a striking mismatch is present at the reactive center region (Ray et al., 1994). Thus, we first sought to identify the DNA fragments carrying the reactive center region of the five genomic clones. This was accomplished by hybridization of the BamHI fragments of the genomic clones using a short DNA fragment containing sequences around the reactive center region as a probe. Next, these BamHI fragments were subcloned and sequenced for further characterization. On the basis of the sequence similarity at the reactive center region, one λ-phage clone was positively identified to be carrying the gene coding the S-2 isoform of the α1-AT protein. This phage clone contains an insert of about 19 kb in size. Southern blot hybridization and DNA sequence analyses with exon-specific oligonucleotides indicated that the rabbit S-2 gene is composed of five exons separated by four introns. These results are summarized in Fig. 2. The arrangements of exons and introns in the S-2 gene are very similar to those in the human and mouse α1-AT genes (Long et al., 1984; Krauter et al., 1986). Inspection of the sequences at splice junctions of the S-2 gene showed that they all contain the correct conserved sequence at the 5′-splice donor and at the 3′-splice acceptor sites (Sharp, 1987). The sequences of the 5′-flanking promoter region of the S-2 gene is presented in Fig. 3. The transcription start site of this gene is known from a previous primer extension analysis (Ray et al., 1994). The sequence of the first 47 nucleotides of the 51-nucleotide 5′-untranslated region obtained from S-2 cDNA matched completely with the exon 1 sequence of S-2 genomic DNA. The remaining 4 nucleotides of the untranslated region and the translation initiator ATG codon are located in exon 2 (not shown). In addition to the TATA box for the binding of transcription factor TFIID, several other transcription factor binding sites, including those for HNF1/LF-B1 (Frain et al., 1989; Costa et al., 1989), HNF3 (Grayson et al., 1988), HNF2/LF-A1 (Rangan and Das, 1990), and C/EBP (Johnson et al., 1987; Costa et al., 1989; DeSimone et al., 1987) are located. Several Sp1 binding GC boxes 5′-GGGCGG-3′ (Kadanoga et al., 1988; Gidoni et al., 1984) are present in direct or inverse orientation at the proximal promoter (within -570 bp) region. At the distal region about 2400 bp upstream of the transcription start site, a potential NF-κB (Sen and Baltimore, 1986)-binding site is identified. Also, several APRF binding motifs (Wegenka et al., 1993) are seen at the distal region. The sequence of the 5′-flanking region and exon I of the rabbit S-2 gene was compared and aligned with the human (Long et al., 1984) sequence (Fig. 4). It is evident that a high level of homology (~67%) exists between these genes at the proximal region (sequences up to -200 from +1). However, further upstream of this region, at sequences between -550 and -200, the overall homology drops to less than 55%. Interestingly, the sequences identified as the DNA-binding elements of HNF1/LF-B1, HNF2/LF-A1, C/EBP, and HNF3 transcription factors, located within the proximal region, are highly conserved between the species, indicating the importance of these elements and the cognate transcription factors in controlling α1-AT gene expression. The divergence at the distal promoter region is quite intriguing.Figure 4:Comparison of the promoter region of rabbit α1-AT S-2 gene and human α1-AT gene.

The position of the transcription start site is indicated by an arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A 3.5-kb DNA fragment containing the upstream 5′-flanking region and the first exon, from nucleotides -3551 to +70 was cloned in the right orientation into the plasmid vector pBLCAT3 (Luckow and Schutz, 1987). This vector does not contain a functional promoter and is entirely dependent upon the functional promoter activity of the ligated heterologous gene sequence. The recombinant reporter gene (pAT-3.5 CAT) was transiently transfected into BNL CL.2 liver and rabbit peripheral blood monocyte cells to analyze its promoter activity. As a control, we also used the parent plasmid pBLCAT3. Transfected liver cells were grown in the absence and presence of 25% conditioned medium, a source of active cytokines obtained from LPS-induced monocyte cells (Ray et al., 1993). Transfected monocytes were induced using 10 μg/ml Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (Sigma) in the incubation medium. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested, and CAT activity was measured. As an internal control for transfection efficiency, cells were cotransfected with a second plasmid pSV-β galactosidase (Promega). Results presented in Fig. 5 show that pAT-3.5CAT is expressed at a low level in both BNL liver and monocyte cells. However, the promoter activity is highly induced when BNL cells are treated with conditioned medium. A similar level of induction was seen in LPS-treated (10 μg/ml) monocytes. These data suggest that the DNA sequences present in the 5′-flanking region (-3551/+70) of the rabbit α1-AT S-2 gene contain elements necessary for induction of reporter gene expression in both liver and monocyte cells under inflammatory condition. To further define the regulatory regions required for LPS-mediated α1-AT gene induction, a series of deletion constructs containing variable lengths of upstream promoter sequences were made (Fig. 6). These plasmids were transiently transfected in rabbit monocyte cells, grown for 24 h with or without LPS, and CAT activity was measured. Results presented in Fig. 6 show that the construct containing a 3.5-kb upstream promoter sequence is highly responsive to LPS stimulation. Deletion of sequences up to -2438 has little effect on the LPS responsiveness of the α1-AT S-2 promoter. However, removal of sequences up to -1990 bp resulted in a severe drop in the promoter inducibility by LPS. Further deletion of upstream sequence up to -619 bp caused a modest increase in the basal transcription which is independent of LPS. This is possibly due to the removal of a negative element which might be located upstream of the -619-bp position. Identity of this putative element is yet to be determined. Together, these data demonstrated that an LPS-dependent transcriptional enhancer element is located between the PstI sites at position -2438 and -1990. To probe further into the nature of the regulatory elements present in the LPS-responsive region of the α1-AT S-2 promoter, the sequence of this region was examined. As shown in Fig. 3, a NF-κB-binding element is seen to be present in this region. To test whether this element is an active binding site for transcription factor NF-κB, we performed EMSA. Nuclear extracts prepared from unstimulated and LPS-stimulated monocyte cells (4 h) were analyzed by electromobility shift assay using a probe spanning the S-2 promoter from -2295 to -2250 which contains an NF-κB element. Two DNA-protein complexes were seen only with induced nuclear extract (Fig. 7A, lane 2). The complexes were competed by molar excess of an oligonucleotide containing NF-κB binding element (Fig. 7B, lane 2). Inability of a mutant oligonucleotide to compete for the complex formation (Fig. 7B, lane 3) indicates specificity of the NF-κB binding. To further verify that the factor binding to the S-2 promoter is indeed a member of the NF-κB family, we used specific antibodies to NF-κB proteins in EMSA. Anti-p65 and anti-p50 antibody effectively supershifted the DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 8). Activation and participation of p50 subunit of NF-κB is evident from the results in lanes 2 and 3. Likewise, involvement of p65 subunit of NF-κB is evident from the results in lanes 4 and 5. These data indicated that both the p50 and p65 subunit of the NF-κB family can interact with the κB element of S-2 gene, located at position -2287 and -2276 in different combinations to form the complexes A and B.Figure 8:Identification of NF-κB/Rel family members that interact with the distal promoter element of the α1-AT S-2 gene. EMSA was performed using 32P-labeled promoter DNA (-2295 to -2250) and nuclear extract (10 μg of protein) from LPS-treated rabbit blood monocytes. Prior to the addition of the 32P-labeled probe, nuclear extract was incubated with 0.5 and 1 μl of a 10-fold diluted anti-p50 antisera (lanes 2 and 3, respectively) or anti-p65 antisera (lanes 4 and 5, respectively). These antisera have been described earlier (Ray et al., 1995). As a control, a nonspecific antisera was also used (lane 6). The preincubation was done at 4°C for 45 min and then incubated with the 32P-labeled probe. Lane 1 contains no antisera. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved in a 6% native polyacrylamide gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the interaction of NF-κB is indeed responsible for the LPS-mediated transcriptional induction of the α1-AT gene, we selectively mutagenized the NF-κB binding element of the S-2 promoter, and a mutated chimeric gene was constructed that contained this altered NF-κB-binding element. The sequence was changed from 5′-GGGGCTTTCCCC-3′ to 5′-GCTCCTTTCGAG-3′. This mutated construct designated as pAT2.4mt NF-κB CAT reporter gene was then transfected into monocytes, and its response to LPS was compared with the reporter gene containing a wild-type sequence (Fig. 9). Mutation of the NF-κB element virtually eliminated the induction of the mutated reporter gene, while the wild-type promoter, in the presence of LPS, induced CAT activity more than 15-fold over background. Thus, the NF-κB-binding site appears to be a necessary regulatory element for activation of the α1-AT gene by LPS. For further verification of the role of NF-κB in potentiating transcription of the α1-AT S-2 gene, NF-κB expression vectors were cotransfected into blood monocytes together with wild-type pAT2.4 CAT or pAT2.4 mt NF-κB CAT reporter plasmids. Overexpression of NF-κB resulted in strong transactivation of the α1-AT promoter in a manner which was dependent on the integrity of the identified NF-κB-binding element (Fig. 10). Both p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB induced transcription in a dose-dependent manner. These results clearly demonstrate the involvement of NF-κB in the transcriptional induction of the α1-AT S-2 gene. Extremely high inducibility of the α1-AT S-2 gene under inflammatory conditions has prompted a detailed analysis of the regulatory elements of this gene. α1-AT is one of the major proteinase inhibitors in serum with a broad range of activities but mainly protects the elastic fibers in lungs from excessive digestion by neutrophil elastase. During the host response to inflammation/injury expression of α1-AT is induced. However, the molecular mechanisms of this induction process is still unclear. This report presents the first clear evidence for a regulatory element that controls the inducible expression of an inflammation responsive α1-AT gene. The major findings of the present study include identification of a distal LPS-responsive promoter region that contains a NF-κB-binding element. This element binds with NF-κB, and its mutation abolishes the LPS-mediated inducibility of α1-AT promoter construct in monocytic cells. Overexpression of NF-κB in monocytes induced the α1-AT expression. The data taken together strongly suggest that LPS-mediated α1-AT gene induction is controlled by NF-κB. Involvement of NF-κB in the α1-AT gene induction process has not been reported earlier. What is the significance of the high level induction of the α1-AT S-2 gene under inflammatory conditions? A logical explanation may be to down-regulate the proteolytic cascade associated with the cell death pathway activated during inflammation. Interleukin 1-β produced and activated in response to inflammation can activate many cellular events causing cell death. IL-1β-converting enzyme (ICE), a mammalian proteinase processes pro-IL-1β to the active form mature IL-1β by proteolytic cleavage at aspartic residues (Black et al., 1988). ICE is also homologous to the ced-3 gene of Caenorhabditis elegans that is essential for apoptosis (Ellis et al., 1991). Recently it has been shown that ICE can be inhibited by a novel cysteine proteinase inhibitor CrmA originally identified in cowpox virus (Ray et al., 1992). Expression of crmA can prevent cell death mediated by ICE as well as quelling other IL-1-mediated inflammatory response. Overexpression of crmA can also prevent cell death mediated by TNF receptor associated death domain protein (Hsu et al., 1995), Fas associated death domain protein (Chinnaiyan et al., 1995), and a death protease Yama, a mammalian homolog of ced-3 (Tewari et al., 1995). In view of high inducibility of the α1-AT S-2 gene under inflammatory conditions, it is possible that a rabbit genome has evolved and maintained this highly inducible proteinase inhibitor to maintain cellular homeostasis and cope with the influx of proteinases brought in by infectious agents upon wounding or infection. It is known that parasites such as Schistosoma mansoni (McKerrow et al., 1985) and bacteria such as Pseudomonas (Werb et al., 1982) synthesize serine proteinases that act as virulence factors to increase the efficiency of infection. In an effort to elucidate the mechanism of transcriptional induction, we undertook the cloning and characterization, as well as sequencing, of the immediate upstream promoter region of the rabbit α1-AT S-2 gene. This gene spans about a 10-kb region and consists of five exons. A translation initiator ATG codon is present at the beginning of the second exon, while the first exon codes for the 5′-untranslated region. The proximal promoter region, up to 200 bp upstream of the transcription start site (Fig. 4) of S-2 gene, shows a high degree of homology with the proximal region of human and mouse α1-AT genes. This region contains a number of major transcription factor-binding elements including HNF1/LF-B1, HNF2/LF-A1, HNF3, and C/EBP which are seen to be highly conserved. Such a high conservation of several transcription factor binding sequences argues for their importance in controlling the basal expression of α1-AT across the species. These elements, however, are not sufficient for the inflammation-induced expression of the S-2 gene. Additional regulatory elements are crucial for its inducibility. This is evident from the detailed promoter analyses of this gene (Fig. 6). Functional studies show that promoter of the S-2 isoform is highly inducible both in liver and monocyte cells in response to cytokines present in the conditioned medium or LPS (Fig. 5). Transient transfection of monocyte cells (Fig. 6) using a series of CAT gene reporter constructs, demonstrates that upstream sequences located between -2438 and -1990 (a 0.5-kb PstI fragment) are important for the induction response mediated by LPS. Analysis of the LPS-responsive region of S-2 promoter revealed the presence of a NF-κB-binding element in this region. Drastic reduction of LPS responsiveness, when the NF-κB-binding element is altered, clearly suggests that NF-κB plays a crucial role for efficient induction of the α1-AT S-2 gene by LPS in monocytic cells. The abilities of (i) inducible NF-κB-like factors to bind to the α1-AT promoter, (ii) anti-p65 and anti-p50 antibodies to supershift the LPS-inducible DNA-protein complex to the α1-AT promoter, and (iii) the overexpression of p65 and p50 subunits of NF-κB to activate α1-AT gene expression further attest to the role of NF-κB as a regulator of α1-AT gene induction. NF-κB is a family of pleiotropic inducible transcription factors originally identified as nuclear factors that bind to the κB enhancer motif of immunoglobulin κ light chain (Sen and Baltimore, 1986). The transcription factor is activated by a number of extracellular signals and cytokines including IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor. Recent numerous studies have shown that NF-κB regulates a wide variety of genes including those of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-2, and serum amyloid A (Bensi et al., 1990; Libermann and Baltimore, 1990; Stein and Baldwin, 1993; Hoyos et al., 1989; Ray et al., 1995). The involvement of NF-κB in the transcriptional induction of α1-AT broadens the range for this factor to yet another gene that is induced in response to inflammatory stress. In this report, we have laid the foundation for more detailed analyses of the regulation of the inducible expression of the α1-AT gene in liver and monocyte/macrophages during the inflammatory response. Increased expression of α1-AT also poses a serious health problem in individuals carrying the Pzzi α1-AT mutant allele. During inflammation, synthesis of α1-AT in these patients is increased, causing greater intracellular accumulation of the defective protein (Barbey-Morrel et al., 1987). Understanding the molecular mechanisms of inducible expression of α1-AT will allow for development of therapies to intervene the increased synthesis and accumulation of the defective protein in the liver of a homozygous Pzzi individual. Further work along this line is currently in progress. We thank Dr. Mark Hannink for generous gifts of NF-κB antibodies."

To explore the possible role of heterotrimeric G proteins in the various regulatory mechanisms of CRAC, continuous renal epithelial cell lines stably expressing α13 and the constitutively active αqQ209L were isolated and used to measure CRAC activity by the Mn2+ quench technique. Release of intracellular Ca2+ by agonist stimulation or thapsigargin was required for activation of CRAC in all cells. Although the size of the internal stores was similar in all cells, CRAC was 2-3-fold higher in α13- and αqQ209L-expressing cells. However, the channel was differentially regulated in the two cell types. Incubation at low [Ca2+]i, inhibition of the NOS pathway, or inhibition of tyrosine kinases inhibited CRAC activity in α13 but not αqQ209L cells. Treatment with okadaic acid prevented inhibition of the channel by low [Ca2+]i and the protein kinase inhibitors in α13 cells. These results suggest that expression of αqQ209L dominantly activates CRAC by stabilizing a phosphorylated state, whereas expression of α13 makes CRAC activation completely dependent on phosphorylation by several kinases. G proteins may also modulate CRAC activity independently of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation state of the pathway to increase maximal CRAC activity.

A small, Pi-containing molecule, named Ca2+ influx factor, was extracted from Jurkat T cells and was suggested to be the diffusible messenger responsible for activation of CRAC(27Randriamampita C.

The α subunits contain the primary information that determines the specificity of receptor and effector interactions. Gαq is widely expressed in mammalian tissues and regulates phospholipase C β isoforms, thereby regulating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production and Ca2+ release from IS.

More recently we showed that stable overexpression of Gα13 in the continuous MCT renal epithelial cell line increases expression and activity of the inducible form of NOS through a transcriptional mechanism. 2K. Kitamura, W. D. Singer, R. A. Star, S. Muallem, and R. T. Miller, submitted for publication. Because of the central role of G proteins in Ca2+ signaling we used MCT cells stably expressing α13 and the activated mutant αqQ209L to study the role of G proteins in regulating CRAC activity. We report here that expression of α13 and αqQ209L markedly increase CRAC influx (2-3-fold) initiated by agonist stimulation or depletion of IS with Tg. In cells expressing α13 CRAC activation required elevated [Ca2+]i, the activity of protein kinases and could be stably activated by OA, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases. In αqQ209L-expressing cells, depletion of IS from Ca2+ maximally activated CRAC independent of [Ca2+]i and cellular kinases/phosphatase activities. These findings suggest that (a) G proteins modulate CRAC influx by direct and indirect interactions and (b) CRAC influx is regulated by multiple kinase/phosphatase-dependent events.MATERIALS AND METHODSFura 2 was purchased from Molecular Probes; tissue culture medium, serum, and G-418 were from Life Technologies, Inc.

Cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium/Ham's F-12 (50:50) plus 5% fetal bovine serum. Experiments were performed when cells were approximately 90% confluent. Serum and G-418 were removed 18-24 h before experiments.Construction of cDNAs and Expression in Mammalian CellsThe cDNA constructs and vectors for stable expression of α13 and αqQ209L were described previously(34Kitamura K.

The cDNAs were expressed in MCT cells using pZem-228 that contains a mouse metallothionein promoter. All studies were performed without heavy metal induction of the α chains because there was an adequate expression of the α subunits without induction. A clonal cell line expressing αqQ209L and neomycin-resistant pooled cells expressing α13 were used for studies. Pooled neomycin-resistant MCT cells expressing pZem-228 without an insert were used as controls (Neo cells)(34Kitamura K. Singer W.D. Cano A. Miller R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C101-C110Google Scholar).Measurement of NOS ActivityNOS activity was measured in whole cells as conversion of [3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline. Cells in 24-well cluster trays were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with 400 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 4.2 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 7.8 mM glucose, and 1 μCi of [3H]arginine, and incubated at 37°C for 15 min. At time 0, BK, L-NAME, or vehicle were added and incubation was continued for additional 10 min at 37°C. The reactions were stopped with 5 M trichloroacetic acid, and the supernatants were extracted with ether and neutralized with 25 mM HEPES. Extracts were added to Dowex columns (AG8 200-400-mesh) and eluted with buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 5.5), 2 mM EDTA, and 2 mM EGTA, and counted. Each sample was corrected for recovery by the addition of approximately 1200 cpm of [14C]citrulline to the stop solution. The counts in each well were normalized for protein and are expressed as cpm/mg of protein/min. Each point represents the mean of triplicate determinations.Measurement of [Ca2+]i and Mn2+ InfluxCells were released from culture plates by a brief incubation with trypsin/EDTA and washed twice with solution A. The composition of solution A was (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.5 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were resuspended in solution A and incubated with 5 μM Fura 2/AM for 20 min at 37°C. After one wash with solution A, the cells were resuspended and kept on ice until use. [Ca2+]i and Mn2+ influx were measured either in cell suspension or by image acquisition and analysis. For measurement in cell suspension (most presented results), samples of Fura 2-loaded cells (50 μl) were added to 1.45 ml of a warm (37°C) solution A and fluorescence was recorded at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 360 nm and at an emission wavelength of 500 nm. After various incubations Mn2+ influx was initiated by adding 0.25 mM Mn2+ to the cuvette. When the cells were incubated in Ca2+-free medium, Mn2+ influx was initiated by adding a mixture of Ca2+ and Mn2+ to final concentrations of 1.5 and 0.25 mM, respectively. When the rate of Mn2+ influx was measured, fluorescence quenching by Mn2+ precluded calibration of the signals to calculate [Ca2+]i. In this case [Ca2+]i changes were evaluated from control experiments under identical conditions, except that the fluorescence signal was calibrated and Mn2+ influx was not measured. Calibration of the signal was as described (22Xu X. Star R.A. Tortorici G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12645-12653Google Scholar). For single cell measurements, the Fura 2-loaded cells were plated on glass coverslips that formed the bottom of a perfusion chamber. The image acquisition and analysis setup was described in detail in previous publications(43Stauffer P.L. Zhao H. Luby-Phelps K. Moss R.L. Star R.A. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19769-19775Google Scholar).RESULTSCRAC Activity in Neo-, α13-, and αqQ209L-expressing MCT CellsCRAC was measured by the Mn2+ quench technique. The activity of CRAC was estimated from the initial rate of Fura 2 fluorescence quench. Fig. 1 shows that stimulation of Neo control MCT cells with a maximal concentration of BK increased Mn2+ influx by about 3-fold (3.19 ± 0.35, n = 7), whereas complete depletion of the IS of Ca2+ with Tg resulted in about a 6-fold (5.93 ± 0.48, n = 15) increase in the rate of influx.Stable expression of the G protein α subunits α13 and the GTPase-deficient αq (αqQ209L) dramatically increased CRAC influx in BK or Tg-stimulated cells. The basal rate of Mn2+ influx was similar in all cells, although it tended to be slightly higher in αqQ209L cells (17 ± 8%, n = 8 relative to paired Neo control or α13 cells). After stimulation of the pooled α13-expressing cells with BK, CRAC activity was 6.78-fold higher than that measured in α13 controls. Treatment of α13 cells with Tg was more effective than BK stimulation in increasing CRAC activity. Tg increased CRAC activity by 16.05-fold above control, which was about 2.49-fold higher than BK in the same cells and 3.01 ± 0.08-fold higher (n = 9) than in Tg-treated Neo control cells. In cells from the clone expressing αqQ209L, BK and Tg stimulation caused similar increases in CRAC activity, which was 10.14- and 11.25-fold above control αqQ209L, respectively. These rates were between 3.18 ± 0.27-fold (n = 4) (BK) and 1.9 ± 0.17-fold (n = 9) (Tg) above the rates measured in similarly treated Neo controls. Similar results were observed in three additional αqQ209L clones and in three clones expressing wild type αq, although in all cases expression of αqQ209L increased CRAC activity more than expression of αq. In the case of α13, recent experiments showed that expression of the GTPase-deficient α13Q226L increased Ca2+ and Mn2+ influx rates similar to α13WT (data not shown).Since CRAC activity increases with increased Ca2+ depletion of IS(3Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.St.J. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 14: 610-631Google Scholar, 44Jacob R. J. Physiol. 1990; 421: 55-77Google Scholar, 45Montero M. Alvarez J. Garcia-Sancho J. Biochem.

J. 1993; 289: 761-766Google Scholar), a possible explanation for the increased activity of CRAC in α13- and αqQ209L-expressing cells is an increased IS pool size and depletion during Tg treatment. This was not the case since measurement of pool size by exposing cells in Ca2+-free medium to high concentrations of ionomycin (47Yamaguchi D.T. Kleeman C.R. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14967-14973Google Scholar) produced similar increases in [Ca2+]i in all cell types. Thus, 5 μM ionomycin increased [Ca2+]i of cells incubated in albumin- and Ca2+-free medium to 848 ± 66 (Neo), 861 ± 58 (α13), and 797 ± 55 (αqQ209L) in 3-5 experiments from different subpassages. In addition, Tg caused similar [Ca2+]i increase in all cells (see below).Regulation of CRAC Activity by [Ca2+]iTo study the role of [Ca2+]i in CRAC activation we measured CRAC activity during Ca2+ depletion and [Ca2+]i restoration. Fig. 2 shows the activity of CRAC at different [Ca2+]i during Tg treatment of Neo, α13, and αqQ209L cells. Tg treatment in Ca2+-free medium caused a similar increase in [Ca2+]i in all cell types, demonstrating the similar size of the IS Ca2+ pool in all cells. After 4 min of incubation with Tg to maximally deplete the pool and reduce [Ca2+]i to resting levels (point a in all experiments) CRAC was almost maximal in αqQ209L cells, intermediate in Neo cells and minimal in α13 cells.Figure 2Dependence of CRAC activity on [Ca2+]i. Neo, α13, or αqQ209L cells were incubated in Ca2+-free solution A (for experiments a-c in each case) or solution A containing 1.5 mM CaCl2 (trace d in each case) and stimulated with 0.1 μM Tg. At different times after exposure to Tg (a and d, 4 min; b, 30 s) cells were exposed to a mixture of Ca2+ and Mn2+ (a and b) or Mn2+ (d) to measure the rate of Mn2+ quench. Cells incubated in Ca2+-free medium and Tg for about 4.5 min were exposed to 1.5 mM CaCl2 for about 30 s to increase [Ca2+]i(trace c) before exposure to Mn2+ for measurement of fluorescence quench rate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The time courses of CRAC activation during IS Ca2+ depletion and during restoration of [Ca2+]i for the three cell types were measured using the protocol of Fig. 2 and are illustrated in Fig. 3. In αqQ209L cells, activation of CRAC required Ca2+ release from IS, but the sustained CRAC activity did not require a sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i. CRAC activity was near maximal after 3 min of incubation with Tg, and remained active when [Ca2+]i was reduced to resting levels (Fig. 3, panel A). CRAC activity did not change with a subsequent increase in [Ca2+]i to about 350 nM (Fig. 3, panel B). In contrast, in cells expressing α13, activation of CRAC required Ca2+ depletion and persistently high [Ca2+]i. During the Ca2+ depletion protocol, CRAC activity mirrored [Ca2+]i, increasing during the first min of incubation with Tg and returning to the basal rate as [Ca2+]i was reduced. Increasing [Ca2+]i then reactivated CRAC (Fig. 3, panel B, open circles). CRAC activation was time-dependent, requiring a 2-min incubation at 37°C, although [Ca2+]i was maximal 20-25 s after addition of [Ca2+]out (Fig. 2). The requirement for [Ca2+]i to activate CRAC in the Neo control cells was intermediate between that of the cells expressing α13 and the cells expressing αqQ209L. However, CRAC activity was 2-3-fold higher in the cells expressing the G proteins than in the Neo cells (Fig. 3, panel B). The requirement of high [Ca2+]i for activation of CRAC in α13 cells is likely to be independent of NOS, since these cells show high NOS activity in the unstimulated state (see below). Hence expression of α13 increased CRAC activity and stabilized it in a [Ca2+]i-dependent form and expression of αqQ209L increased CRAC activity and stabilized it in a [Ca2+]i-independent form.Figure 3Time course of CRAC activation during Ca2+ depletion (A) and [Ca2+]i restoration (B). The protocol of figure 2 was used to measure rates of Ca2+ influx during Ca2+ depletion and [Ca2+]i restoration. 100% control was taken as the rate of quench in Fig. 2(trace d) of α13 cells. At different times during Tg treatment in Ca2+-free medium (25 s, 1, 2, 3, or 5 min) of the different cell types a mixture of Ca2+ and Mn2+ was added to measure the rate of fluorescence quench (panel A). Then 1.5 mM Ca2+ was added to increase [Ca2+]i as in Fig. 2(trace c) and Mn2+ quench rates were measured 0.5, 1, 2 or 5 min after addition of Ca2+ (panel B). The results in the figure are the mean of 3 (Neo), 5 (α13), and 4 (αqQ209L) experiments. S.E. were between 5 and 12% of the signals and are not shown for clarity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Regulation of CRAC Activity by the NO PathwayCRAC activity can be regulated by cGMP generation through the activation of NOS(22Xu X.

In previous studies we used a molecular and biochemical analysis to demonstrate the transcriptional induction of NOS by α13 to increase NOS protein and activity in extracts of MCT cells.2Fig. 4 shows the activity of NOS in intact MCT cells under resting and stimulated conditions. Basal NOS activity was about 8-fold higher in cells overexpressing α13 than in control Neo cells. Expression of αqQ209L also increased basal NOS activity but to a much lower extent than in cells expressing α13. Similar results were obtained when NO-2 production was measured (data not shown). Importantly, BK stimulation increased NOS activity in Neo controls and in cells expressing αqQ209L. The effect of BK on NOS activity in α13-overexpressing cells was less prominent, probably because of the high basal activity, which reduced the signal/noise ratio. L-NAME blocked the majority of citrulline production from arginine, indicating that citrulline was produced by NOS. Hence these cells should provide an excellent system to study the role of NOS in regulating the Ca2+ influx pathway.Figure 4NOS activity in intact MCT cells. Cells were preincubated for 15 min in arginine-deficient medium and [3H]arginine. They were then stimulated with 50 nM BK in the presence or absence of 5 mML-NAME for an additional 10 min. The reactions were stopped with trichloroacetic acid, extracted with ether, and [3H]citrulline separated from [3H]arginine by column chromatography.

Treatment of control, α13, or αqQ209L cells with the arginine analog L-NAME, which inhibits NOS activity(48Moncada S. Palmer R.J.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142Google Scholar), or NO-2, an NO donor(22Xu X. Star R.A. Tortorici G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12645-12653Google Scholar, 49Furchgott R.F. Vanhoutte P.M.

Raven Press, New York1988: 410-414Google Scholar), had no effect on CRAC activity when IS were loaded with [Ca2+]i (Fig. 6). However, L-NAME almost abolished CRAC activity in α13 cells, whether it was activated by BK (Fig. 6) or Tg (Figure 5, Figure 6). Inhibition of CRAC by L-NAME was completely reversed by bypassing NOS inhibition with NO-2 to supply the cells with NO and activate the soluble guanylyl cyclase. cGMP was as effective as NO-2 in reversing the inhibitory effect of L-NAME (data not shown).Figure 5Effect of NOS inhibition and a NO donor on CRAC activity in cells expressing α13 and αqQ209L. Cells in solution A were treated for 10 min at 37°C with or without 5 mML-NAME. Samples of the cells were also incubated for 2 min with 15 mM NO-2 before stimulation with 0.1 μM Tg.

The procedure used to treat the cells and measure fluorescence quench was the same as that described in the legend to Fig. 5. The various cell types were stimulated with 50 nM BK or 0.1 μM Tg as indicated. The rate of fluorescence quench in Tg-treated α13 cells was taken as 100% control. The figure shows the mean ± S.E. of 3-4 experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In contrast to the finding in α13 cells, L-NAME and NO-2 had no effect on BK or Tg-activated CRAC activity in αqQ209L cells. Thus, L-NAME did not inhibit CRAC activity in BK- or Tg-treated cells and increasing cGMP with NO-2 did not increase CRAC activity beyond that measured in the absence of NO-2. Again, in Neo controls both NO-sensitive and NO-insensitive components of CRAC activity (a mixture of the behavior observed in α13- and αqQ209L-overexpressing cells) was found, with lower maximal CRAC activity.Effect of Protein-tyrosine Kinase InhibitorsProtein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors reduce the activity of CRAC(14Peppelenbosch M.

The monooxygenase, PAM, first catalyzes conversion of a glycine-extended pro-peptide to the corresponding α-hydroxyglycine derivative, and the lyase, PGL, then catalyzes breakdown of this α-hydroxyglycine derivative to the amidated peptide plus glyoxylate. We have previously established that PAM and PGL exhibit tandem reaction stereospecificities, with PAM producing, and PGL being reactive toward, only α-hydroxyglycine derivatives of absolute configuration (S). We now demonstrate that PAM and PGL exhibit dramatically different subsite stereospecificities toward the residue at the penultimate position (the P2 residue) in both substrates and inhibitors. Incubation of Ac-L-Phe-Gly, Ac-L-Phe-L-Phe-Gly, or (S)-O-Ac-mandelyl-Gly with PAM results in complete conversion of these substrates to the corresponding α-hydroxylated products, whereas the corresponding X-D-Phe-Gly compounds undergo conversions of <1%. The KI of Ac-D-Phe-Gly is at least 700-fold higher than that of Ac-L-Phe-Gly, and the same pattern holds for other substrate stereoisomers. This S2 subsite stereospecificity of PAM also holds for competitive inhibitors; thus, the KI of 45 μM for Ac-L-Phe-OCH2CO2H increases to 2,247 μM for the -D-Phe- enantiomer. In contrast, incubation of PGL with Ac-L-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly, Ac-D-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly, (S)-O-Ac-mandelyl-α-hydroxy-Gly, or (R)-O-Ac-mandelyl-α-hydroxy-Gly results in facile enzymatic conversion of each of these compounds to their corresponding amide products. The simultaneous expression of high reaction stereospecificity and low S2subsite stereospecificity in the course of PGL catalysis was illustrated by a series of experiments in which enzymatic conversion of the diastereomers of Ac-L-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly and Ac-D-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly was monitored directly by HPLC. Kinetic parameters were determined for both substrates and potent competitive inhibitors of PGL, and the results confirm that, in sharp contrast to PAM, the configuration of the chiral moiety at the P2 position has virtually no effect on binding or catalysis. These results illustrate a case where catalytic domains, which must function sequentially (and with tandem reaction stereochemistry) in a given metabolic process, nevertheless exhibit sharply contrasting subsite stereospecificities toward the binding of substrates and inhibitors.

Elucidation of the stereochemistry of carboxyl-terminal amidation is a critical issue for detailed mechanistic studies on the enzymology of this process and for the rational design of pseudosubstrates and inhibitors targeted at PAM and PGL. In this regard, we recently demonstrated that PAM and PGL exhibit tandem reaction stereospecificities in carrying out the two requisite steps in carboxyl-terminal amidation(29Ping D. Katopodis A.G. May S.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3998-4000Google Scholar). Thus, PAM produces only α-hydroxyglycine derivatives of absolute configuration (S), and PGL is reactive only toward (S)-α-hydroxyglycines (Fig. S1). While these results elucidate the reaction stereospecificity of both PAM and PGL toward the COOH-terminal (S)-α-hydroxyglycine moiety, the quite distinct question of whether PAM and PGL differ with respect to subsite stereospecificity remains unresolved. We report here a series of experiments, which demonstrate that PAM and PGL indeed exhibit dramatically different subsite stereospecificities toward the residue at the penultimate position (the P2 residue) 2The nomenclature for amino acid residues (or analogs) of substrates (P1, P2, etc.) and the corresponding enzyme subsites (S1, S2, etc.) is that originally proposed by Schecter and Berger(30Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Google Scholar). of their respective substrates. In addition, we introduce new competitive inhibitors for PAM and PGL, and we demonstrate that the distinctive difference in S2 subsite2 stereospecificities for substrates is also reflected in the binding of competitive inhibitors targeted at either enzyme, respectively. Finally, we illustrate the simultaneous expression of high reaction stereospecificity and low S2 subsite stereospecificity in the course of PGL catalysis by a series of experiments in which enzymatic conversion of all four diastereomers of Ac-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly was monitored directly by HPLC. Thus, these results provide a clear example of a case where catalytic domains, which must function sequentially (and with tandem reaction stereochemistry) in a given metabolic process, nevertheless exhibit contrasting subsite stereospecificities toward the binding of both substrates and inhibitors.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6115-6120Google Scholar). PGL assays were performed in 100 mM sodium 2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonate, pH 6.5, containing 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, at 37°C. PGL inhibition was established using TNP-D-Tyr-Val-α-hydroxy-Gly as the PGL substrate. PAM assays were performed as described previously (11Katopodis A.G. Ping D. Smith C.E. May S.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6189-6194Google Scholar) with the addition of 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in assay mixtures. PAM inhibition by O-glycolate ester derivatives was established using the continuous assay developed in our laboratory(31Li C. Oldham C.D. May S.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 31-36Google Scholar). Typically, PAM was incubated with the O-glycolate ester derivatives, in the presence of Ac-D-Tyr-Val-Gly (PAM substrate). Values for Vmax and Km were obtained from the inverse plots by using a least-squares fit program; standard errors of 10% or less were calculated for the kinetic parameters listed in the tables. These compounds were synthesized on a Rainin PS3 automated solid phase peptide synthesizer using the standard Fmoc protocol. All procedures were done according to the instructions in the manual. The time for the coupling step was 50 min, and acetylation was carried out after the synthesis of the tripeptide-resin. Each of the tripeptide products exhibited a single peak on a C8 RP-HPLC with a gradient from 15% CH3CN, 85% H2O, 0.2% phosphoric acid to 75% CH3CN, 25% H2O, 0.2% phosphoric acid over 60 min. Synthetic Ac-L-Phe-L-Phe-Gly and Ac-L-Phe-D-Phe-Gly have specific rotation values of -32.9° and 44.8°, respectively. A mixture of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-D-phenylalanine (2.6 g), glycine ethyl ester hydrochloride (1.4 g), triethylamine (1.0 g), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (1.5 g), and dimethylformamide (15 ml) were cooled in an ice bath, and 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (2.3 g) was added. The mixture was stirred overnight at 4°C, and the dimethylformamide was evaporated under vacuum. To the solid, 30 ml of ethyl acetate was added and the remaining solid was removed by filtration. The ethyl acetate layer was washed sequentially with 10% citric acid, saturated sodium bicarbonate water, and saturated sodium chloride water (3 × 30 ml each), and dried over MgSO4. Evaporation of the ethyl acetate afforded a white solid product, Boc-D-Phe-Gly-OEt (2.4 g). Cleavage of the Boc group by trifluoroacetic acid (5 times molar excess) gave D-Phe-Gly-OEt. Ac-D-Phe-Gly-OEt (0.8 g) was obtained by acetylation of D-Phe-Gly-OEt (1.0 g) in a mixture of 10 ml of pyridine and 4 ml of acetic anhydride for 30 min at room temperature. The crude Ac-D-Phe-Gly-OEt (0.5 g, 1.7 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of methanol and water (20 ml, 1:1), and 3.8 ml of 0.5 M NaOH (1.9 mmol) was then added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature, and the hydrolysis of Ac-D-Phe-Gly-OEt was monitored on a C8 PR-HPLC column with an isocratic solution of H2O/CH3CN (80/20, 0.2% phosphoric acid). Nearly complete hydrolysis was achieved in about 2 h, after which the pH of the solution was adjusted to neutrality with dilute HCl. The mixture was extracted with methylene chloride (2 × 30 ml) to remove any unreacted Ac-D-Phe-Gly-OEt. The pH of the solution pH was then adjusted to about 3.0 and extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 30 ml). The ethyl acetate layer was dried over MgSO4 and evaporated to dryness to give Ac-D-Phe-Gly (0.3 g). 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6, 300 MHz) δ: 8.20 (d, 1H, CO2H), 7.15-7.30 (m, 5H, Ph), 4.50 (m, 1H, NHCHCONH), 3.85 (d, 2H, NHCH2CO2H), 3.05 (dd, 1H, PhCHHCH), 2.73 (dd, 1H, PhCHHCH), 1.75 (s, 3H, CH3CO). Mass spectroscopy (electron impact): m/z 264 (M+, molecular ion). This compound was synthesized using the solid-phase method, with the procedure being analogous to the synthesis of Ac-L-Phe-L-Phe-Gly. Synthetic Ac-D-Phe-Gly has a specific rotation value of -11.8° in methanol. This compound was synthesized by the same procedures used for the synthesis of Ac-D-Phe-Gly. Synthetic Ac-L-Phe-Gly has a specific rotation value of 11.9° in methanol. Both (R)-and (S)-O-Ac-mandelyl-Gly tert-butyl esters were synthesized by the synthetic procedure used for the synthesis of Boc-D-Phe-Gly ethyl ester. Cleavage of the tert-butyl group by trifluoroacetic acid (5 × molar excess) gave the desired products. These compounds were synthesized according to a published procedure(32Heathcock C.H. Org. Synth. 1987; 66: 132-140Google Scholar). The amide products exhibit the following specific rotation in methanol: Ac-D-Phe-amide, [α] = -26.1°; (S)-O-Ac-mandelic amide, [α] = 146.7°; (R)-O-Ac-mandelic amide, [α] = -146.8°. These compounds were synthesized according to a previously published method(11Katopodis A.G. Ping D. Smith C.E. May S.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6189-6194Google Scholar). The two diastereomers of Ac-L-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly (with the configurations (S,S) and (S,R)) and the two diastereomers of Ac-D-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly (with the configurations (R,S) and (R,R)) were separated on a C8 RP-HPLC column with an isocratic solution of H2O/CH3CN (98/2, 0.2% phosphoric acid). (R)-2-Phenylbutyric acid (1.0 g, 6.09 mmol) was converted to its acid chloride by reaction with cyanuric chloride, according to a published procedure(33Venkataraman K. Wagle D.R. Tetrahedron Lett. 1979; : 3037-3040Google Scholar). The acid chloride was then dissolved in anhydrous ether (20 ml) and treated with anhydrous ammonia gas to form the corresponding amide. The insoluble ammonium chloride salt was filtered off. The filtrate was washed twice with aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, dried over MgSO4, concentrated under reduced pressure, and recrystallized from ether/hexane. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz) δ: 7.26-7.38 (m, 5H, Ph), 5.31 (bs, 2H, NH2), 3.29 (t, 1H, COCHCH2), 1.78-2.25 (m, 2H, CH3CH2CH), 0.90 (t, 3H, CH3). (R)-2-Phenylbutyramide (0.28 g, 1.70 mmol) was then reacted with glyoxylic acid in acetone, as described in the literature(34Zoller U. Ben-Ishai D. Tetrahedron. 1975; 31: 863-866Google Scholar), to give (R)-2-phenylbutyl-α-hydroxy-Gly (0.21 g).

C12H15NO4⋅1/4 H2OCalculated:C 59.62 H 6.46N 5.79Found:C 59.45 H 6.50N 5.56 To a solution of bromoacetic acid (4.5 g, 32 mmol) in ethyl acetate (500 ml) were added phenacyl bromide (33 g, 0.17 mol) and triethyl amine (4.5 ml, 32 mmol)(35Stelakatos G.C. Paganou A. Zervas L. J. Chem. Soc. (C). 1966; : 1191-1199Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature and filtered to remove the insoluble triethylamine hydrobromide salt. The filtrate was washed with saturated NaHCO3 solution until no more bromoacetic acid showed on TLC (eluting solvent: EtOAc), then washed with water twice. The organic layer was dried over NaSO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. Excess phenacyl bromide was removed by distillation under vacuum and the residue recrystallized from EtOAc/hexane, to give pure 2-bromophenacyl acetate (4.74 g). Melting point: 76-78°C; 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz) δ: 7.89 (d, 2H), 7.61 (m, 1H), 7.51 (t, 2H), 5.42 (s, 2H, CO2CH2COPh), 4.01 (s, 2H, BrCH2CO2). To a solution of Ac-glycine (1.0 g, 8.54 mmol) in 30 ml of acetonitrile were added 2-bromophenyl acetate (2.2 g, 8.56 mmol) and 1,8-diazabicyclo [5.4.0] undec-7-ene (1.3 ml, 8.69 mmol)(36Rao C.G. Org. Prep. Proc. Int. 1980; 12: 225-228Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. Water was then added (50 ml) and the mixture extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 50 ml). The combined organic extracts were washed with water (50 ml), dried over NaSO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Recrystallization from EtOAc/hexane gave pure Ac-Gly phenacyl acetate (1.6 g). Melting point: 119-121°C; 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz) δ: 7.88 (d, 2H), 7.61 (t, 1H), 7.48 (t, 2H), 5.42 (s, 2H, CO2CH2COPh), 4.88 (s, 2H, CONHCH2CO2), 4.17 (d, 2H, CO2CH2CO2), 2.03 (s, 3H, CH3CO). Deprotection of the terminal carboxylic acid was achieved by stirring the ester with zinc dust in glacial acetic acid (20 ml) at room temperature, for 3 h(37Hendrickson J.B. Kandall C. Tetrahedron Lett. 1970; : 343-344Google Scholar). The zinc dust was filtered off. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and dried under vacuum overnight to remove all traces of acetic acid. The residue was then dissolved in water (50 ml) and washed twice with ethyl acetate (50 ml). The aqueous layer was then concentrated, dried under vacuum over P2O5, and the residue recrystallized from ethanol/hexane, giving N-Ac-Gly acetic acid ester (0.56 g). Melting point: 144-146°C; 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6, 300 MHz) δ: 4.57 (s, 2H, NHCH2CO2), 3.89 (d, 2H, CO2CH2CO2H), 1.85 (s, 3H, CH3CO); mass spectroscopy (electron impact): m/z 175 (M+, molecular ion).

After evaporation of acetic acid, the residue was dissolved in water, washed once with EtOAc/hexane 2:8, then with hexane. The aqueous layer was lyophilized to give Ac-L-Phe-OCH2CO2H (0.29 g) as a very hygroscopic powder. [α] = 40.2° in methanol; 1H NMR (D2O, 300 MHz) δ: 8.37 (d, 1H, CO2H), 7.20-7.28 (m, 5H, Ph), 4.61 (d, 2H, CO2CH2CO2H), 4.55 (m, 1H, NHCHCO2), 3.10 (dd, 1H, NHCHCHHPh), 2.86 (dd, 1H, NHCHCHHPh), 1.76 (s, 3H, CH3CO); mass spectroscopy (FAB-MS): m/z 266 (M + 1). This compound (0.45 g) was synthesized by the same procedure used for Ac-L-Phe-OCH2CO2H, starting from Ac-D-Phe (1.40 g). [α] = -37.8° in methanol; 1H NMR (D2O, 300 MHz) δ: 8.37 (d, 1H, CO2H), 7.20-7.28 (m, 5H, Ph), 4.61 (d, 2H, CO2CH2CO2H), 4.55 (m, 1H, NHCHCO2), 3.10 (dd, 1H, NHCHCHHPh), 2.86 (dd, 1H, NHCHCHHPh), 1.76 (s, 3H, CH3CO); mass spectroscopy (FAB-MS): m/z 266 (M + 1). These compounds (0.70 g and 0.68 g, respectively) were synthesized by the same procedure used for Ac-L-Phe-OCH2CO2H, starting from Ac-L-Leu (1.50 g), and Ac-D-Leu (1.0 g), respectively. Ac-L-Leu-OCH2CO2H and Ac-D-Leu-OCH2CO2H have specific rotation values of -45.4° and 48.1°, respectively, in methanol; 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6, 300 MHz) δ: 8.24 (d, 1H, CO2H), 4.54 (d, 2H, CO2CH2CO2H), 4.34 (q, 1H, NHCHCO2), 1.83 (s, 3H, CH3CO), 1.65 (m, 1H, CH2CH(CH3)2), 1.55 (m, 2H, NHCHCH2CH), 0.86 (dd, 6H, (CH3)2CH); mass spectroscopy (FAB-MS): m/z 232 (M + 1). While in early work using crude preparations of “amidating enzyme,” Bradbury et al.(38Bradbury A.F. Finnie M.D.A. Smyth D.G. Nature. 1982; 298: 686-688Google Scholar, 39Bradbury A.F. Smith D.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 112: 372-377Google Scholar) observed that a tripeptide possessing a D-Ala residue at the penultimate position did not undergo amidation; it is unknown whether this reflects the stereospecificity of PAM, of PGL, or of both enzymes. We therefore began by determining the subsite stereospecificity of PAM. Glycine-extended peptides possessing residues of either the L or D configuration at their respective penultimate (P2) positions were synthesized and tested as substrates for purified PAM (Table 1). Incubation of Ac-L-Phe-Gly, Ac-L-Phe-L-Phe-Gly, (S)-O-Ac-mandelyl-Gly, or TNP-D-Tyr-L-Val-Gly (the latter being our standard PAM substrate; (40Katopodis A.G. May S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 499-505Google Scholar)) with PAM resulted in progressive conversion of all of these compounds to their respective α-hydroxylated products. The time course of the PAM-catalyzed conversion of Ac-L-Phe-Gly to Ac-L-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly is illustrated in Fig. 1. For all four compounds, nearly 100% conversion to the α-hydroxylated product was observed after a reaction time of 2 h or less.TABLE I Open table in a new tab In contrast, as shown in Fig. 1, when Ac-D-Phe-Gly is incubated with a large quantity of PAM, product formation is barely detectable. Examination of HPLC traces at high sensitivity revealed appearance of a very small amount, i.e. at most, 0.5% conversion, of product with retention time corresponding to that of authentic Ac-L-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly within the first few minutes of incubation, with no further conversion being detectable even after 20 h. Similarly, incubation of PAM with either Ac-L-Phe-D-Phe-Gly or (R)-O-Ac-mandelyl-Gly results in conversions of less than 0.2% and 0.9%, respectively. Control experiments confirmed that PAM remains fully active after incubation with these substrates. In order to demonstrate directly that this S2 subsite stereospecificity affects substrate binding, apparent KI values were determined for both Ac-L-Phe-Gly and its non-reactive -D-Phe- enantiomer using our standard assay substrate, TNP-D-Tyr-L-Val-Gly. As is evident from the data in Table 1, there is a dramatic 700-fold difference between the apparent KI values for the two Ac-Phe-Gly enantiomers. Moreover, the true KI of Ac-L-Phe-Gly is actually even lower than the value of 2 μM listed in the table, since some reaction of Ac-L-Phe-Gly itself occurs during the initial rate measurements. Although reaction of Ac-Phe-Gly is transparent to our assay, it causes the measured KI to be higher than the true value. The KI of 580 μM for Ac-L-Phe-D-Phe-Gly is 480-fold higher than the Km for its L-Phe-L-Phe-diastereomer, and the same pattern is true for (R)- and (S)-O-Ac-mandelyl-Gly. Thus, it is clearly evident from these results that substrate reactivity toward PAM is virtually abolished by the presence of a D-amino acid residue, or of the stereotopically equivalent (R)-mandelyl residue, at the P2 position. To determine whether the S2 subsite stereospecificity observed with PAM substrates is also reflected in the potency of competitive inhibitors, O-glycolate ester derivatives of N-acetylated amino acids of the L or D configuration were synthesized. Initial experiments with Ac-L-Phe-OCH2CO2H confirmed that this ester is a potent inhibitor, and not a substrate, for PAM. Kinetic experiments were then carried out with the esters listed in Table 2. As is evident from the KI values in the table, inhibitor potency is markedly reduced when the configuration of the amino acid residue at the P2 position is inverted. Thus, the KI of 45 μM for Ac-L-Phe-OCH2CO2H increases to 2,247 μM for the -D-Phe- enantiomer; the corresponding values for Ac-L-Leu-OCH2CO2H and its -D-Leu- enantiomer are 60 μM and 2,115 μM, respectively. Indeed, Ac-L-Phe-OCH2CO2H and Ac-L-Leu-OCH2CO2H are the most potent PAM competitive inhibitors yet reported; inhibition is purely competitive, as evidenced from Dixon plots. Taken together, these results demonstrate the high S2 subsite stereospecificity of PAM toward both substrates and inhibitors.TABLE II Open table in a new tab Incubation of synthetic Ac-L-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly, Ac-D-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly, (S)-O-Ac-mandelyl-α-hydroxy-Gly, or (R)-O-Ac-mandelyl-α-hydroxy-Gly with PGL resulted in facile enzymatic conversion of each of these compounds to their corresponding amide products. The time courses of the PGL-catalyzed conversion of Ac-D-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly to Ac-D-Phe-NH2 and of (R)-O-Ac-mandelyl-α-hydroxy-Gly to (R)-O-Ac-mandelyl-NH2 are shown in Fig. 2. It is evident from these time courses that enzymatic turnover terminates prior to complete conversion of the substrates to amide products by PGL. Therefore, prolonged incubation experiments with PGL were carried out to quantitate the maximal percentage conversion of Ac-L-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly, Ac-D-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly, (S)-O-Ac-mandelyl-α-hydroxy-Gly, and (R)-O-Ac-mandelyl-α-hydroxy-Gly to their corresponding amide products. As shown in Table 3, maximal conversion in all cases is about 50%. To further confirm this result, a double addition experiment was carried out wherein Ac-L-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly and Ac-D-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly were each first incubated overnight with PGL then analyzed by HPLC to confirm 50% conversion, after which the enzyme was removed by ultrafiltration. Each filtrate was then again incubated with a large quantity of PGL, and monitored by HPLC. As expected, no additional enzymatic conversion of unreacted substrate to amide products occurred for either substrate.TABLE III Open table in a new tab Synthetic preparations of Ac-L-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly and (S)-O-Ac-mandelyl-α-hydroxy-Gly actually consist of equimolar mixtures of their respective (S,S) and (S,R) diastereomers; similarly, synthetic Ac-D-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly and (R)-O-Ac-mandelyl-α-hydroxy-Gly actually consist of equimolar mixtures of the respective (R,S) and (R,R) diastereomers. Previously, we demonstrated that PGL is stereospecific toward the terminal α-hydroxyglycine moiety(29Ping D. Katopodis A.G. May S.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3998-4000Google Scholar), i.e. PGL reacts only with α-hydroxyglycine moieties of the (S) configuration. Accordingly, if PGL exhibits the same S2 subsite stereospecificity as PAM, we would expect 50% conversion only for Ac-L-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly and (S)-O-Ac-mandelyl-α-hydroxy-Gly, while Ac-D-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly and (R)-O-Ac-mandelyl-α-hydroxy-Gly should have been unreactive toward PGL. Therefore, our finding that 50% conversion actually occurs with all these substrates (Table 3) is a strong indication that, unlike PAM, PGL reacts with substrates possessing residues of either the (S) or (R) configuration at the P2 position. In order to demonstrate directly this simultaneous expression of high reaction stereospecificity and low S2subsite stereospecificity in the course of PGL catalysis, the series of HPLC experiments illustrated in Fig. 3 was carried out. Panel A shows the HPLC elution profile of Ac-L-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly produced from Ac-L-Phe-Gly by PAM. Since PAM catalysis produces only α-hydroxyglycines of the (S) configuration, this peak represents the retention time of the (S,S) diastereomer of Ac-L-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly. Panels B and C show the elution profiles of synthetic Ac-L-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly and Ac-D-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly, respectively. It is evident from panels B and C that the two diastereomers of synthetic Ac-L-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly (with the configurations (S,R) and (S,S)) and the two diastereomers of synthetic Ac-D-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly (with the configurations (R,S) and (R,R)) are well separated on a C8 RP-HPLC column using a mobile phase of 2% CH3CN, 98% H2O, 0.2% H3PO4. Panels D and E show the elution profiles obtained after reaction of Ac-L-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly and Ac-D-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly, respectively, with PGL. It is quite clear from panel D that reaction of PGL with synthetic Ac-L-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly results in conversion of only one substrate diastereomer to Ac-L-Phe-NH2. Since the reactive diastereomer has retention time identical to that of Ac-L-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly (with (S,S) configuration) produced by PAM (Fig. 3, panel A), it is clear that this reactive diastereomer has the (S,S) configuration. Correspondingly, as shown in panel E, reaction of PGL with synthetic Ac-D-Phe-α-hydroxy-Gly also results in conversion of only one diastereomer of this substrate to Ac-D-Phe-NH2. From a comparison with the previous panels, it is quite clear that the reactive diastereomer of this substrate has the (R,S) configuration. Taken together, these experiments unequivocally confirm the sharp contrast between the reaction and the subsite stereospecificities of PGL; while PGL is reactive only toward an α-hydroxyglycine moiety of the (S) configuration, this lyase reacts readily with substrate diastereomers of either the (S) or (R) configuration at the P2 position. Kinetic parameters for the two pairs of diastereomeric PGL substrates are listed in Table 4. It is apparent that the Vmax values are virtually unaffected by whether the residue at the P2 position has the (S) or (R) configuration, whereas small effects are apparent on the Km values. Both pairs of compounds are comparable in reactivity to N-benzoyl-α-hydroxy-Gly.TABLE IV Open table in a new tab A systematic specificity study revealed that the substrate analog, phenylacetyl-α-OH-Gly, is an inhibitor of PGL with a KI value of 770 μM; inhibition is purely competitive as evidenced by Dixon plots. Therefore, in order to determine the effect of stereochemical configuration at the P2 position on the potency of PGL inhibitors, we synthesized (R)-2-phenylbutyl-α-hydroxy-Gly and (S)-2-phenylbutyl-α-hydroxy-Gly, analogs of phenylacetyl-α-OH-Gly each possessing a chiral center of opposite configuration at the penultimate position. As is the case for the PGL substrates discussed above, synthetic (R)-2-phenylbutyl-α-hydroxy-Gly actually consists of an equimolar mixture of the (R,S) and (R,R) diastereomers; likewise, synthetic (S)-2-phenylbutyl-α-hydroxy-Gly is an equimolar mixture of (S,S) and (S,R) diastereomers. Both (R)-2-phenylbutyl-α-hydroxy-Gly and (S)-2-phenylbutyl-α-hydroxy-Gly were found to indeed be PGL inhibitors. We also observed that they both undergo very slow enzymatic conversion to the corresponding phenylbutyramides (as confirmed by HPLC analysis). The substrate activity (V/K) of these compounds is ~10,000 times slower than that of our normal PGL assay substrate, TNP-D-Tyr-L-Val-α-hydroxy-Gly; therefore, inhibition kinetics are readily performed in the usual manner. Both compounds are highly potent competitive inhibitors, and the KI values obtained are 280 μM and 310 μM for (R)-2-phenylbutyl-α-OH-Gly and (S)-2-phenylbutyl-α-OH-Gly, respectively (Table 5). It is thus clear that, in sharp contrast to PAM, the configuration of the chiral moiety at the P2 position has no effect on the potency of these PGL inhibitors.TABLE V Open table in a new tab Table 5 also lists the kinetic constants measured for the very slow PGL-catalyzed reaction of these two compounds. As expected, Vmax and Km are identical for (R)- and (S)-2-phenylbutyl-α-OH-Gly. Moreover, the measured Km values are identical to the KI values obtained in the inhibition experiments against TNP-D-Tyr-L-Val-α-hydroxy-Gly, thus confirming that the Km values represent true binding constants. Taken together, the results reported here establish that despite their tandem reaction stereospecificities with respect to the COOH-terminal (S)-α-hydroxyglycine moiety, PAM and PGL exhibit sharply contrasting S2 subsite stereospecificities in the binding of both substrates and inhibitors. Physiologically, these two enzymatic steps must occur sequentially in order to convert a given glycine-extended pro-peptide to the corresponding mature amidated peptide(9Katopodis A.G. Ping D.

Thus, from a metabolic viewpoint, the stereospecificities of these catalytic domains would have been expected to correlate. From a mechanistic perspective, there is, of course, a vast difference between the catalytic site of a metallo-monooxygenase on the one hand, which entails participation of both active-site copper and an electron donor in catalysis, and that of a lyase on the other. Indeed, the contrasting stereospecificities we report here are likely reflections of corresponding differences in the active site topographies of PAM and PGL. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a case where catalytic domains that must function sequentially nevertheless exhibit contrasting binding stereospecificities. Most likely, the possibility that stereospecificities of such domains might differ has not been addressed since, of course, metabolites flow through the catalytic domains in sequence; a given domain would never “see” a metabolite of altered chirality such that it would have been precluded from binding at the preceding domain. Thus, inspection of the stereochemical configurations of metabolic intermediates does not reveal possible differences in the subsite stereospecificities of the domains; stereochemical studies using substrate analogs and inhibitors of deliberately altered chirality are required for this purpose. For example, in the case of chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydrogenase, a multifunctional protein catalyzing sequential reactions that has been the subject of much recent interest(41Turnbull J. Cleland W.W. Morrison J.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10245-10254Google Scholar, 42Turnbull J. Morrison J.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10255-10261Google Scholar, 43Bartlett P.A. Nakagawa Y. Johnson C.R.

Chem. 1988; 53: 3195-3210Google Scholar), the relative stereochemistry at the ring position para to the site of enzymatic reaction clearly affects reactivity of substrate analogs in the dehydrogenase reaction. However, a comparison of the effect of commensurate changes in subsite stereochemistry on binding and turnover for the individual catalytic domains has not been carried out, and, unfortunately, synthetic approaches to the synthesis of individual substrate analog stereoisomers that might be used in such investigations have been unsuccessful(41Turnbull J.

We have found that DSFL- formation resulting from exposure to H2O2 and any of a number of different peroxidases is greatly enhanced in the presence of the nitrone spin trap α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (4-POBN). This enhancement was seen at 4-POBN concentrations as low as 200 μM. We observed a modest enhancement of DSFL- formation with 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane. However, no enhancement was seen with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline 1-oxide (DMPO) or phenyl-tert-butylnitrone. A modest enhancement was also seen with the nitrone compound pyridine N-oxide. 2-Methyl-2-nitrosopropane and pyridine N-oxide were additionally capable of increasing enzymatic peroxidase activity as measured by o-dianisidine and/or tetramethylbenzidine oxidation. Furthermore, at high concentrations of 4-POBN (50 mM) in the absence of DSFL, we detected a peroxidase/H2O2-dependent 12-line EPR spectrum that likely represents a 4-POBN/-4-POBN nitrogen-centered spin adduct. In the presence of both 4-POBN (10 mM) and DMPO (100 mM), an 18-line EPR spectrum was observed consistent with formation of a DMPO/-4-POBN nitrogen-centered spin adduct. Thus, the nitrone spin trap 4-POBN can enhance the peroxidase-mediated formation of DSFL-, possibly via the formation of a transient 4-POBN radical species.

Three ectodomain constructs of the α chain (αRED) bearing C-terminal epitope tags were engineered and expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. Each recombinant α chain was secreted into the medium, maximum expression occurring 72 h post-infection. The various soluble α chains were shown by affinity cross-link labeling and competition with unlabeled IL-5 to bind recombinant human (rh) 125I-IL-5 specifically with an ED50 of 2-5 nM.

In humans, IL-5 activity appears to be restricted to eosinophil/basophil lineages and may play a role in the regulation of eosinophilic inflammation associated with various diseases, notably bronchial asthma(1Sanderson C.J.

The human receptor for IL-5 consists of two components: a 60-kDa ligand-binding α chain (IL-5αR) and a 130-kDa β chain (IL-5βR), which does not by itself bind IL-5 but forms a high affinity signal transducing receptor with the IL-5/α chain complex(2Tavernier J. Devos R. Cornelis S. Tuypens T. Van der Heyden J. Fiers W. Plaetinck G. Cell. 1991; 66: 1175-1184Google Scholar). The cloning and characterization of the IL-5 receptor α chain identified two mRNA species that correspond to alternatively spliced soluble isoforms of the full-length transmembrane α chain(2Tavernier J. Devos R. Cornelis S. Tuypens T. Van der Heyden J. Fiers W. Plaetinck G. Cell. 1991; 66: 1175-1184Google Scholar, 3Murata Y. Takaki S. Migita M. Kikuchi Y. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 341-351Google Scholar). One of these alternatively spliced mRNA species is the major transcript expressed in eosinophilic HL-60 cells (4Fishkoff S.A. Leuk. Res. 1988; 12: 679-686Google Scholar) and in eosinophils grown from cord blood(2Tavernier J. Devos R. Cornelis S. Tuypens T. Van der Heyden J. Fiers W. Plaetinck G. Cell. 1991; 66: 1175-1184Google Scholar). These soluble receptors may play a role in the immunoregulation of eosinophilia by neutralizing the biological activity of secreted IL-5. This report describes the baculovirus expression of three ectodomains of the ligand-binding IL-5 receptor α chain (S1-, S2- and S3-αRED). Epitope tags were engineered onto the C termini of the various constructs allowing purification in a mild single-step procedure. The purified proteins were then shown to bind IL-5 and to neutralize the biological activity of this potent pro-inflammatory hematopoietin in a cellular proliferation assay, suggesting that such recombinant soluble receptor forms may have utility in the therapy of eosinophilic inflammation. The human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 (ATCC CCL 240) and murine B cell leukemia cell line BCL-1 clone 5B1b (ATCC TIB 197) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The eosinophilic strain of HL-60 cells (HL-60/MF211#7) was developed essentially as described previously (4Fishkoff S.A. Leuk. Res. 1988; 12: 679-686Google Scholar, 5Scheid M. Metters K.M.

Recombinant human interleukin-5 was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) or was produced in a baculovirus expression system, purified, and characterized as described elsewhere (6Brown P.M. Scheid M.P. O'Neill G.P. Tagari P. Nicholson D.W. Protein Exp. Purif. 1995; 6: 1-9Google Scholar). Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells, Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV), the TA cloning kit, and a linear AcMNPV DNA transfection module were purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). The baculovirus transfer vector pETL was obtained from Dr. C. Richardson (Biotechnology Research Institute, National Research Council Canada, Montreal, PQ). The FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody and anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel were purchased from IBI Inc. (New Haven, CT). The FLAG peptide Ac-DYKDDDDK was synthesized by AnaSpec Inc. (San Jose, CA). FPLC chromatography columns were purchased from Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology (Uppsala, Sweden). Chemiluminescence Western blotting reagents, protein molecular weight markers, streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, and sheep anti-mouse horseradish-peroxidase conjugate were from Amersham Corp. Carrier-free N125I was obtained from Nordion International (Ottawa, Ontario, Cananda). The BIAcore system, CM5 sensor chips and amine coupling kit were obtained from Pharmacia Biosensor AB (Uppsala, Sweden). IODO-BEADS, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3), and the BCA protein assay reagent kit were from Pierce. N-Glycosidase F (EC 3.2.2.18) and molecular biology reagents were from Boehringer Mannheim unless specified otherwise. Cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc., and protease inhibitors were from Sigma. Total RNA was isolated from the human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell line by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method(7Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar), and poly(A) RNA was purified by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography (mRNA separator kit, Clontech). The cDNA encoding the full-length IL-5 receptor α chain was obtained as two overlapping fragments by reverse transcription, followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification. Poly(A) HL-60 RNA (2 μg/reaction) was reverse-transcribed (10 min for 23°C; 15 min for 42°C; GeneAmp RNA PCR kit, Perkin-Elmer) and then heated to 95°C for 5 min. A PCR gem was added (Ampliwax(TM) PCR gem; Perkin-Elmer) and then PCR amplification of the cDNA was performed using standard methods (3 mM MgCl2, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase/100 μl of reaction volume; 8). The cycling conditions were as follows: 32 cycles of 94°C, 90 s; 51°C, 30 s; 72°C, 90 s, followed by a 10-min extension at 72°C. The oligonucleotides GO78 (ATGATCATCGTGGCGCATGTATTA) and GO98 (CTACTTACCCACATAAATAGGTTGGCTCCACTCACT) were used to amplify a 1002-base pair fragment corresponding to clone lL5R.25(3Murata Y. Takaki S. Migita M. Kikuchi Y. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 341-351Google Scholar). A second pair of oligonucleotides, GO80 (CCTCCACTGAATGTCACAGCAGAG) and GO79 (TCAAAACACAGAATCCTCCAGGGT) amplified a 542-base pair fragment spanning nucleotides 721-1263 of the published IL-5 receptor α chain sequence (clone lh5R.12; 3). Amplified bands of the appropriate size were electrophoretically transferred to DEAE-cellulose (NA-45 DEAE-cellulose, Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, N.H.) and then directly cloned into EcoRV-digested, T-modified pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA). Escherichia coli XL-1 cells were transformed, restriction digests performed on purified plasmid preparations, and insert-containing preparations sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination method (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH) according to standard procedures(10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids containing the 5′-1002 base pairs α chain (clone pBSK-IL5R-α3) and the 3′-542 base pairs of the receptor (clone pBSK-IL-5R-α11) were then used to reconstruct the full-length IL-5 receptor α chain by restriction digestion of both pBSK-IL-5R-α3 and pBSK-IL-5R-α11 with BamHI and SacI and ligation into BamHI-digested pBSK to generate pBSK-IL-5R-α. The full-length IL-5 receptor α chain clone (pBSK-IL-5R-α) was used as a template to engineer three alternate forms of the soluble extracellular domain of the IL-5 receptor α chain in two sequential PCR amplification reactions as follows: the oligonucleotide DN265 (CGCGGATCCCCGCCATGATCATCGTGGCG) served as the sense primer for all three soluble forms of the IL-5 receptor α chain. The oligonucleotides PB20 (TCTTGAGAACCCCACATAAATAGGTTGGCTCCACTCACTCCA),PB23 (CTTACCCACATAAATAGGTTGGCTCCACTCACTCCA), andPB26 (CCACTCTCTCAAGGGCTTGTGTTCATCATTTCC) served as the antisense primers in the first round of PCR reactions to amplify the regions of cDNA corresponding to the regions encoding the various C-terminal amino acids of the three soluble receptor isoforms. Oligonucleotides PB22 (GGATCCCTATTATTTATCATCATCATCTTTATAATCTCTTGAGAACCCCACATA), PB25 (GGATCCCTATTATTTATCATCATCATCTTTATAATCCTTACCCACATAAATAGG), and PB27 (GGATCCCTATTATTTATCATCATCATCTTTATAATCCCACTCTCTCAAGGGCTT) were the antisense primers for the second round of PCR in which the 8-amino acid FLAG epitope tag followed by two stop codons and a BamHI restriction site were engineered onto the 3′ end of the products of the first round of PCR. The polymerase chain reactions were carried out as described earlier in the presence of 3 mM MgCl2, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase/reaction, and cycling as follows: 20 cycles of 94°C, 30 s; 45°C, 30 s; 72°C, 1 min. Amplified fragments of the appropriate size were purified and then cloned into the pCR II vector with the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Insert-containing clones were sequenced, and when required, restriction digestion and ligation were performed in order to construct a complete cDNA sequence free of PCR errors. Recombinant transfer vectors pETL-αRED S1-, S2- and S3-FLAG were constructed by ligating the corresponding BamHI fragments into the BamHI site of pETL downstream of the polyhedrin promoter. The orientation of the RED S1-, S2-, and S3-FLAG inserts were determined by restriction mapping and the junctions confirmed by sequencing. Recombinant baculovirus was produced by in vivo homologous recombination following cationic liposome-mediated transfection of the recombinant transfer vectors in the presence on linearized AcMNPV DNA (Invitrogen) and was identified and purified according to standard procedures(11O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Insect cells (Sf9) were maintained in 1-liter suspension cultures in Grace's insect cell medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at a cell density between 0.4 and 2.0 × 106 cells/ml. Infection of the insect cells was carried out under low serum conditions by first harvesting cells in log-phase growth by centrifugation at 300 × g (10 min, 22°C), discarding the supernatant, washing the cells with serum-free medium (Sf900 II, Life Technologies, Inc.) and then centrifugation at 300 × g (10 min, 22°C). The supernatant was discarded and the cells resuspended in Sf900 II medium to a cell density of 2-3 × 106 cells/ml. Recombinant baculovirus was then added at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 3. The recombinant virus-infected insect cells were harvested at 72 h postinfection (>90% trypan blue excluding) by centrifugation at 300 g. Protease inhibitors were added to the cell pellet (20 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 34 mM E-64 (trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido(4-guanido)butane)), and lysis was performed in D-PBS, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (30 min, 22°C) at one-tenth the original cell culture volume (20-30 × 106 cells/ml) of Triton lysis buffer, and cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation (12000 × g, 5 min). Protease inhibitors were added to the supernatant (2 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin and soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 3.4 mM E-64) as was 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. The conditioned medium was then titrated to pH 7.4, filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane and then applied to an 8 cm × 1-cm FLAG-M2 affinity column (IBI). The column was then washed extensively with D-PBS (calcium and magnesium-free, Life Technologies, Inc.) and the αRED eluted with either 100 mM glycine, pH 3.0, into tubes containing one-tenth volume of 1 M Tris, pH 8.0, or with a step gradient of FLAG peptide (50 μg/ml, 100 μg/ml in D-PBS). The eluted fractions containing αRED were then pooled and dialyzed extensively against D-PBS. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) and purity of the affinity column-eluted material was determined by silver staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). Immunoblot analysis was carried out essentially as described previously (12Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar) following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions(13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The αRED was detected following incubation with 20 μg/ml M2 FLAG monoclonal antibody (IBI) with the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham). Affinity-eluted fractions containing soluble receptor were identified by dotting small aliquots of each fraction onto nitrocellulose and then carrying out ECL immunoblot detection. Purified αRED was deglycosylated with N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim, EC 3.22.18) as described previously (14Thotakura N.R. Bahl O.P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 350-359Google Scholar) by first reducing and denaturing the αRED by boiling in the presence of 0.1% (w/v) SDS and 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. 1% (w/v) n-octyl glucoside was added to the protein samples to stabilize the enzyme against inactivation by SDS, and then 2 units of N-glycosidase F were added. After a 16-h incubation at 22°C, another 2 units of N-glycosidase were added, the samples incubated an additional 2 h at 22°C and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis as described above. Conditioned medium from recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells was diluted 50-fold into D-PBS, pH 7.4, and was incubated with 0.5 nM125I-rhIL-5 in the presence of 0-200 nM unlabeled rhIL-5 for 3 h at 4°C. BS3 was then added to a final concentration of 1 mM and incubated on ice for 10 min before quenching with 100 mM glycine pH 9.0. The cross-linked samples were then reduced and denatured (5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 1% (w/v) SDS), subjected to SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography (Kodak X-Omat). The kinetics of association and dissociation of IL-5 to the purified soluble receptor (αRED) were studied in real time, without labeling any of the reagents, using a surface plasmon resonance detector (BIAcore, Pharmacia Biosensor AB). The detector utilized in the BIAcore system monitors the refractive index at the surface of a sensor chip, which changes as the amount of adsorbed mass varies due to specific interaction between the sensor and a component of the analyte flowing across the sensor surface. The changing refractive index upon interaction was expressed in arbitrary response units (R, with Rmax designating the maximum binding capacity of the sensor surface as detailed previously; (15Jonsson U.

Biol. 1993; 13: 3567-3576Google Scholar)). The sensor surface was prepared by covalent coupling of recombinant human IL-5 (carrier-free, R & D Systems; 10 μg/ml in 20 mM NaOAc, pH 4.5) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min using the amine coupling kit containing N-hydroxysuccinimide, N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride and 1 M ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5, as described by the manufacturer (Pharmacia Biosensor AB). The extent of coupling was controlled by varying the time of sensor chip activation, IL-5 exposure, and ethanolamine quenching from 1 min/step to 7 min/step. Sensorgrams were generated by passing αRED-containing analyte solutions across the IL-5-modified sensor surface from which the rate of association (kon) could be derived. Dissociation rate constants (koff) were similarly derived by then passing D-PBS across the IL-5 sensor/αRED complex surface according to the following reaction for a simple bimolecular interaction. IL−5+αRED⇄koffkonIL−5/αREDREACTION 1 Since IL-5 was immobilized to the sensor chip, the increase in R upon αRED binding was a reflection of the amount of IL-5/αRED complex formed and the maximum amount of IL-5/αRED complex that could form was determined by the amount of active IL-5 present and accessible for interaction with the analyte (Rmax). dR/dt=kon[αRED][Rmax−R]−(koff[R])(Eq. 1) The association rate constant was derived from analysis of the association phase of sensorgrams obtained by passing varying concentrations of analyte (αRED) solutions across a single IL-5 sensor surface and plotting the changing response with time (dR/dt) against R at that time so that a line with slope of -(kon[αRED] + koff) or -ks, results. When ks is then plotted against the concentration of αRED in each of the solutions the slope of the resulting line is equal to the association rate constant (ka or kon). The dissociation rate constant was derived from the portion of the sensorgram where the analyte solution was replaced with buffer and the dissociation of αRED from the IL-5 sensor surface monitored as a decrease in the response units. Integration of the first order rate equation dR/dt = k Rt and plotting the initial phase of the dissociation sensorgram as ln (Rt1/Rtn) versus time resulted in a line with a slope equal to the negative of the dissociation rate constant (-kd or -koff). The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was obtained from the equation Kd = koff/kon. The IL-5 sensor surface was regenerated with a 5-μl pulse of 20 mM HCl between exposure to successive αRED-containing analyte solutions. Circular dichroism spectra were measured with a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter. All spectra were obtained at a resolution of 0.5 nm and bandwidth of 2 nm. In all cases, 5 spectra were averaged, a buffer base line subtracted, and final spectra smoothed by a digital filtering procedure. Protein concentrations of 1.15 or 2.3 M were used in 0.1-cm path length cells, which were thermojacketed at 22°C. For secondary structure estimation, data were converted to mean residue ellipticity(18Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Google Scholar). Thermal unfolding experiments were performed under the same conditions with an AVIV 62DS spectropolarimeter. Ellipticity was monitored at 5 wavelengths (208, 215, 222, 230, and 350 nm) at 2°C increments with a 2-min incubation period at each wavelength, a period sufficient for equilibrium to be obtained. Fluorescence spectra were obtained with an Hitachi F-4500 spectroflurometer. Excitation and emission bandwidths of 2.5 and 5.0 nm were employed, respectively, and a scan speed of 240 nm/min was used. Protein concentrations of 1.15 and 2.3 M were used in 1 × 0.1-cm cuvettes. Samples were excited at 295 nm to produce > 95% emission from Trp residues. All spectra were corrected for photomultiplier response and Raman scattering. Equilibrium sedimentation was performed with a Beckman Optima XLA analytical ultracentrifuge. Experiments were conducted at 16,000 and 22,000 rpm in an An60Ti rotor at a protein concentration of 0.6 M at 4°C, using complexes formed under conditions identical to those used in the circular dichroism and fluorescence experiments. Data were analyzed by a nonlinear fitting program provided by the National Ultracentrifugation Center at the University of Connecticut. The murine B-cell lymphoma BCL-1 (obtained from ATCC) was passaged five times in RPMI 1640 cell culture medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum in the presence of penicillin and streptomycin. The cells were harvested by gentle scraping, washed once, and resuspended in serum-free medium (Kemp Biotechnologies; Cyto SF-4) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin at a concentration of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml. Aliquots (60 μl) were transferred to a flat-bottomed microtiter plate and preincubated at 37°C. Recombinant human IL-5 (0-500 nM) was mixed with purified αRED (0, 30, 100, or 300 nM) in quadruplicate aliquots in serum-free medium in a polypropylene microtiter plate. Receptor and ligand were incubated for 30 min at 37°C and 95% humidity, and then 60-μl aliquots mixed with the preincubated BCL-1 cells. Cellular proliferation of BCL-1 in the presence/absence of rhIL-5/αRED was assayed after 17 h at 37°C and 95% humidity by the conversion of a tetrazolium salt MTT (Promega) to formazan over 8 h, and quantitated by measurement of optical density at 570 nm. Prior experiments have shown that this technique was essentially equivalent to [3H]thymidine incorporation in these cells (data not shown). Fig. 1 illustrates the cloning strategy employed to engineer the three soluble isoforms of the ligand-binding extracellular domain bearing C-terminal epitope tags of eight amino acids (FLAG, IBI Inc.) from the cDNA corresponding to the full-length IL-5 receptor α chain cDNA. The S1-αRED and S2-αRED constructs correspond to the S1 and S2 nomenclature previously assigned to the two alternatively spliced mRNA species identified encoding for soluble variants of the full-length transmembrane IL-5 receptor α chain(19Tavernier J. Tuypens T. Plaetinck G. Verhee A. Fiers W. Devos R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7041-7045Google Scholar). The S3-αRED construct corresponds to the entire extracellular ligand-binding domain of the IL-5 receptor up to but not including the first amino acid in the putative transmembrane domain (Fig. 1A; (3Murata Y. Takaki S. Migita M. Kikuchi Y. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 341-351Google Scholar)). A single oligonucleotide, DN265, when used to prime the PCR reactions incorporated a BamHI restriction site into the cDNA as well as a consensus sequence for introducing a favorable context around the AUG initiator codon for optimal translation (Fig. 1B; (20Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Google Scholar)). Three different oligonucleotides (PB20, PB23, and PB26) were paired with DN265 to introduce the appropriate coding sequences at the 3′ end of the cDNA to encode the C-terminal amino acids of the soluble S1-, S2-, and S3-αRED. A final round of PCR reactions paired oligonucleotide DN265 to the three oligonucleotides PB22, PB25, and PB27 to introduce the sequence encoding the eight amino acid FLAG epitope tag, two stop codons and a BamHI restriction site (Fig. 1C). The final three cDNAs were then cloned into BamHI-digested baculovirus transfer vector pETL as BamHI fragments behind the polyhedrin promoter and then recombinant virus was generated by in vivo homologous recombination in Sf9 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” There are 10 noncoding bases present at the 5′ end of the αRED cDNA when introduced as a BamHI fragment before the initiator methionine of the αRED. Insect cells in log phase of growth (1-1.5 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with high titer recombinant virus stock at an multiplicity of infection of approximately 3 under low serum conditions (0.5% FBS). When infected at a cell density of 2-3 × 106 cells/ml, 3-5 mg/liter αRED was routinely obtained in a single-step affinity purification. Fig. 2 illustrates the time course of expression of the three isoforms of the soluble IL-5 receptor. Immunoreactive material was evident at 48 h postinfection both in the Triton-solubilized cell lysate as well as in the media. The media were routinely harvested at 72 h postinfection when greater than 90% of the cells excluded trypan blue, but significant cell death (and the production of associated proteolytic enzymes) had not yet occurred. The S1-αRED and S2-αRED proteins appear to be efficiently processed and secreted as evidenced by the lack of a large amount of cell-associated immunoreactive material at the various time points. The S3-αRED, on the other hand, consistently expressed to approximately 50% of the yield of the S1- and S2-αRED constructs and displayed approximately 50% of the total immunoreactive material associated with the cells (Fig. 2C). The S3-αRED protein did not appear to be associated with the cell membrane of the infected insect cells, nor was a large amount of the intracellular material capable of binding IL-5 since affinity cross-linking of S1-, S2-, and S3-αRED recombinant virus-infected cells displayed equivalent low levels of 125I-IL-5 binding to intact infected insect cells. Triton X-100 (1%) lysates of pETL-S1-, S2-, and S3-αRED construct-infected insect cells bound 125I-IL-5 to equivalent levels indicating that the large amount of cell-associated immunoreactive material in the S3-αRED cell lysates is incapable of binding IL-5 (data not shown). The affinity of the αRED (S1-,S2-, and S3-) for IL-5 was estimated by affinity cross-link labeling of the αRED in the conditioned media prior to purification. Fig. 3 demonstrates that 2-5 nM rhIL-5 is required to compete 50% of 0.5 nM125I-IL-5 from a receptor solution of approximately 0.5 nM. The results of densitometric scanning of the autoradiograms in Fig. 3A are shown in Fig. 3B and illustrates that the affinity of the three isoforms of the αRED appear identical. Fig. 4A is a representative immunoblot analysis of a purification of approximately 350 mg of S1-αRED material from 100 ml of 2.6 × 106 cells/ml harvested at 72 h postinfection. A single pass of the titrated, filtered conditioned medium over the affinity matrix depleted the media of the αRED (S1-αRED; Fig. 4A, lane 1 (before purification) and lane 2 (after a single pass over the affinity column)). The column was washed extensively (see “Experimental Procedures”) and the S1-αRED eluted with 100 mM glycine to >95% purity (Fig. 4A, lanes 3-10) on silver-stained SDS-PAGE gels (data not shown). The purified material was heterogeneous and ran as a doublet under reducing SDS-PAGE. The he"

Among these, neurotrophic factors play important roles in the nervous system by supporting neuronal activity and survival. It has been suggested recently that certain factors promote neuronal survival in the case of brain injury. To examine this possibility, we purified a novel neurotrophic factor from Gelfoam that was implanted at the site of injury caused in neonatal rats. During amino acid sequence analysis, we found that a fragmental peptide of this neurotrophic protein consisting of 13 amino acids showed neurotrophic activity. This 13-mer peptide promoted survival of septal cholinergic and mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons in culture and rescued hippocampal neurons from injury caused by glutamate in culture. This peptide rescued neurons from cell death caused by glutamate, even when added 4.5 h after glutamate exposure. Neuronal survival is mediated by several kinds of proteins.

Among these, neurotrophic factors are thought to play important roles in both the peripheral and the central nervous system. Many studies have indicated that a lack of neurotrophic factor(s) causes neuronal cell death and therefore that injury to the central nervous system of an adult animal would lead to massive death of neurons. Recently, however, it has been reported that the central nervous system has the potential to partially recover from injury. Several studies showed that such neurotrophic activity was high around the site of injury(1Niet-Sampedro M. Lewis E.R. Cotman C.W. Manthorpe M. Skaper S.D. Barbin G. Longo F.M. Varon S.

Quinonero J. Boose J.Q. Jacque C. Neuron. 1993; 10: 213-224Google Scholar). Not only these factors but also several cytokines that exist in the central nervous system are up-regulated in the injured brain. These observations suggest that there are systems maintaining neuronal activities in the injured brain even after the central nervous system is fully developed. We are in the process of isolating a novel neurotrophic factor, which promotes neuronal survival from Gelfoam implanted at the site of injury caused in neonatal rats, using the primary cultures of septal neurons from rat neonates as an assay system. While pursuing this factor, we found that a fragment of this protein consisting of 13 amino acids promoted neuronal survival and rescued neurons from injury caused by glutamate. This finding might open the possibility of therapeutic application of neurotrophic peptide to the injured brain. tumor necrosis factor α high pressure liquid chromatography Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium brain injury-derived neurotrophic peptide nerve growth factor choline acetyltransferase 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid acetylcholinesterase. A peptide corresponding to the sequence of the tryptic fragment of a neurotrophic protein was synthesized by solid phase methodology of common t-butoxycarbonyl chemistry starting from p-methylbenzhydrylamine using a Biosearch model 9500 peptide synthesizer. After hydrogen fluoride cleavage, the crude peptide was purified by successive chromatographies with Sephadex G-25F, preparative HPLC with ODS columns, and Sephadex G-25F. The structure and purity of the peptide were confirmed by analytical HPLC, amino acid analysis, and fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy measurement. Primary cell cultures were prepared following the method of Hatanaka et al.(10Hatanaka H. Tsukui H. Nihonmatsu I. Neurosci. Lett. 1987; 79: 85-90Google Scholar). Briefly, the septal area was removed out from Wistar rat neonates (9-10 days of age). Cells were dissociated with papain and plated on polyethyleneimine-coated plastic dishes at a density of about 3 × 105 cells/cm2. Cultures were maintained for 6 days with a DF medium (1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and F-12 medium) and supplemented with 5% precolostrum newborn calf, 5% heat-inactivated horse, and 1% rat sera. BINP or NGF was added at the indicated concentration on the next day of plating. Determination of ChAT activity for the extract of cell culture was done according to the method of Fonnum(11Fonnum F.A. J. Neurochem. 1975; 24: 407-409Google Scholar). Hippocampal neurons were isolated with papain from Wistar rat embryos of gestational day 18, plated on polyethyleneimine-coated glass coverslips at a density of 1.5-2.5 × 105 cells/cm2 (dish diameter, 15 mm), and maintained for 7 days in DMEM supplemented with 5% precolostrum newborn calf and 5% heat-inactivated horse sera (12Ogura A. Akita K. Kudo Y. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 9: 103-113Google Scholar). On the day of examination, after arbitrary view fields were photographed with a 10× phase-contrast optic, the culture medium was exchanged sequentially with 1) serum-free DMEM (5 min), 2) serum-free DMEM supplemented with or without 1.2 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM glutamate (30 min), 3) serum-free DMEM (5 min), and 4) sera-containing DMEM. All treatments were done at 37°C. Twenty-four h later, the identical fields were photographed (to facilitate identification, the coverslips had grating printed on the back). Cells possessing phase-bright somata and neurites (larger than soma diameter, without beading) on pairs of photographs before and after exposure of glutamate were counted and, the rate of remaining cells was calculated. Neurotrophic activities were assayed to examine the promotion of the survival of septal cholinergic neurons by measuring ChAT activities with primary cultures from neonatal rats (10-14 days of age). Sponge Gelfoam made of gelatin (3Manthorpe M. Nieto-Sampedro M. Skaper S.D. Lewis E.R. Barbin G. Longo F.M. Cotman C.W. Varon S. Brain Res. 1983; 267: 47-86Google Scholar) was implanted in a cavity made in the frontal part of the cerebrum of a neonatal (4-5 days of age) rat brain and left for 7 days. Gelfoam (19 g) frozen at -80°C was homogenized with 200 ml of DF (minus serum) medium and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was concentrated by 30-60% ammonium sulfate and applied on a Superose 12 column equilibrated with 0.1% CHAPS in phosphate-buffered saline. The active fractions corresponding to molecular masses of about 20-14 kDa were applied on a Mono S ion-exchange column equilibrated with 0.1% CHAPS in 50 mM acetate buffer, pH 5.0. The unadsorbed fractions were applied several times on the same Mono S column. The unadsorbed fraction (protein concentration was 0.017 mg/ml) was concentrated about 6 times, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using Phast system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) with 8-25% acrylamide gradient gel. Proteins were stained by silver according to the method of Heukeshoven and Dernick(13Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 28-33Google Scholar). Staining for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was performed according to the method of Hefti et al.(14Hefti F. Hartikka J. Eckenstein F. Gnahn H. Heumann R. Schwab M. Neuroscience. 1985; 14: 55-68Google Scholar). Following the fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, the cultures were incubated for 5 days at 4°C in 50 mM acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 4 mM acetylthiocholine iodide (substrate), 0.2 mM tetraisopropyl pyrophosphoramide (pseudocholinesterase inhibitor), and gelatin (prevention of diffusion of reaction product). Primary cultures were carried out by using the under part of the midbrain (containing mainly substantia nigra) from a postnatal 10-day-old rat in the same way as described in the cell culture(15Hama T. Kushima Y. Miyamoto M. Kubota M. Takei N. Hatanaka H. Neuroscience. 1991; 40: 445-452Google Scholar). Six days after plating, cultures were sonicated in 0.1 M perchloric acid, and the contents of intracellular dopamine were measured by HPLC using an electrochemical detector. On the ion-exchange column chromatography, the unadsorbed fraction and fractions eluted with 0.25, 0.3, and 0.4 M NaCl (fractions I, II, and III, respectively, in Fig. 1B) showed significant neurotrophic activity. Fraction I contained β-NGF, which was detected by immunoblotting using anti-β-NGF. Fractions II and III have not yet been analyzed. The unadsorbed fraction contained a major band with a molecular mass of 15 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which was not detected by anti-β-NGF (Fig. 1C). The protein with a molecular mass of 15 kDa was electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and was digested with trypsin. The resulting fragmental peptides were separated on a C18 reverse-phase column with HPLC, and those amino acid sequences were analyzed. Based on the amino acid sequence of one of the fragmental peptides, a peptide consisting of 13 amino acids (EALELARGAIFQA) named BINP was authentically synthesized. BINP was found to promote the survival of septal cholinergic neurons (Fig. 2). Various concentrations of BINP were added to the septal cell cultures, and 6 days later the activity of ChAT of the cultured cell extracts was measured as an index of the survival of cholinergic neurons. The ChAT activity of the cultures treated with BINP was remarkably higher than those of the control cultures (up to 5 times at the dose of 1.0 ng/ml) (Fig. 2A). The same effect was seen in the serum-free cultures of septum enriched in neurons (not shown). The survival of septal cholinergic neurons was confirmed by staining for AChE. The number of AChE-positive neurons cultured on an astroglial feeder layer with a supplementation of BINP was greater than the number of AChE-positive cells in the control culture (without BINP), and with 1.0 ng/ml BINP, the number was almost 2.5 times greater than the number in the control culture (Fig. 2B). The AChE-positive neurons in the BINP-supplemented cultures had long and well arborized neurites (Fig. 2C). Although BINP was identified as a survival-promoting factor for septal neurons, we thought it would be of interest to examine whether BINP has a similar effect on other classes of neurons. Therefore, we cultured the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra from rat neonates with or without the addition of BINP. The amount of dopamine in the cell extract of the BINP-added (5.0 ng/ml) culture measured by HPLC with an electrochemical detector was about 2.5 times greater than that in the control culture (Fig. 3). This result coincided with the fact that the number of neurons immunostained by an antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase in the BINP-added culture was significantly greater than that in the control culture (not shown). Next we examined whether BINP rescues the hippocampal neurons injured by excessive excitation by glutamate. The hippocampal neurons exposed to glutamate usually undergo disintegration with the passage of time, and this phenomenon has been widely used as a model system for the analysis of ischemic neuronal death(16Ogura A. Miyamoto M. Kudo Y. Exp. Brain Res. 1988; 73: 447-458Google Scholar, 17Choi D. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 369-379Google Scholar, 18Rothman S. Thurston J.H. Hauhart R.E. Neuroscience. 1987; 22: 471-480Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, BINP was effective in rescuing the neurons from glutamate excitotoxicity. As shown in the dose-effect relationship in Fig. 4A, not all hippocampal neurons were rescued, but we have not determined whether rescuable and unrescuable cells belong to distinct populations of neurons. For the rescuable cells, the half-effective dose of BINP was around 1.0 ng/ml. It is noteworthy that BINP exerted its effect even after the exposure to glutamate (Fig. 4B), though the effect gradually diminished with the delay of the timing of application. BINP not only promotes neuronal survival but also rescues neurons from injury caused by glutamate. Since these effects were reproducible in cultures with or without astroglial feeder layers, BINP presumably acted directly on the neurons. Most of the known substances reducing the glutamate excitotoxicity (including glutamate receptor antagonists (16Ogura A. Miyamoto M. Kudo Y. Exp. Brain Res. 1988; 73: 447-458Google Scholar, 19Frandsen A. Drejer J. Schousboe A. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 297-299Google Scholar), calcium channel blockers(16Ogura A. Miyamoto M. Kudo Y. Exp. Brain Res. 1988; 73: 447-458Google Scholar, 20Rich K.M. Hollowell J.P. Science. 1990; 248: 1419-1421Google Scholar), calcium chelators(21Kudo Y. Takeda K. Yamazaki K. Brain Res. 1990; 528: 48-54Google Scholar), etc.) were effective only when applied prior to exposure to glutamate. From this viewpoint, BINP may be of clinical interest. Basic fibroblast growth factor(22Mattson M.P. Murrain M. Guthrie P.B. Kater S.B. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3728-3740Google Scholar, 23Cheng B. Mattson M.P. Neuron. 1991; 7: 1031-1041Google Scholar), NGF(23Cheng B. Mattson M.P. Neuron. 1991; 7: 1031-1041Google Scholar), insulin-like growth factors(24Cheng B. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1558-1566Google Scholar), and TNFs (25Cheng B. Christakos S. Mattson M.P. Neuron. 1994; 12: 139-153Google Scholar) can protect neurons against metabolic excitotoxicity caused by glucose deprivation in culture. TNFs and interleukin 6 (26) were also effective in protecting neurons from glutamate treatment; however, pretreatment with TNFs was required for protection of neurons from glutamate toxicity(25Cheng B. Christakos S. Mattson M.P. Neuron. 1994; 12: 139-153Google Scholar). Reduction of glutamate excitotoxicity by BINP is not due to competition with glutamate, since BINP was effective even when applied after the exposure to glutamate. BINP per se did not lower the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration nor did it suppress the magnitude of glutamate-evoked cytoplasmic Ca2+ elevation. 2A. Ogura and T. Hama, unpublished observation. BINP may interfere with a signal cascade leading to cell death in the downstream of Ca2+ and act by using a mechanism different from those factors. When the amino acid sequence of a fragmental 17-mer peptide of the 15-kDa protein containing BINP was compared with the protein data bank, there was no homology with any neurotrophic factors or cytokines. Interestingly, the 17-mer fragmental peptide showed the highest homology with the chicken proteasome C1 subunit (70% residue identity); however, the rat proteasome C1 subunit showed less similarity with the 17-mer fragmental peptide (41% residue identity) than that of chicken proteasome C1. We have obtained one more peptide and sequenced it. The amino acid sequence of this peptide has also been compared with the Protein Data Bank and GenBank. This peptide showed no similarity with either neurotrophic factors or cytokines, and moreover, it had no similarity with the proteasome C1 subunit. The activity of this peptide has not been examined because it was small. Therefore, the neurotrophic factor containing BINP must be a novel one, and the relationship between proteasome and BINP needs further investigation. From the data of immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-BINP antibody, this novel neurotrophic factor is synthesized from astrocyte. 3T. Hama, M. Ishiguro, and M. Maruyama, unpublished data. The complete amino acid sequence of the protein will soon be published elsewhere. Not only is the structure of the protein of interest, but the fact that its small fragment (Mr = 1385.59) is sufficient in exerting the neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects suggests the possibility of its clinical and research applications.
