https://openalex.org/W2056590571,"In S. cerevisiae, the chromatin structure of DNA replication origins changes as cells become competent for DNA replication, suggesting that G1 phase-specific association of replication factors with origin DNA regulates entry into S phase. We demonstrate that ORC, Cdc45p, and MCM proteins are components of prereplication complexes (pre-RC). The MCM-origin association is dependent upon ORC and Cdc6p. During S phase, MCM proteins and Cdc45p dissociate from origin DNA and associate with nonorigin DNA with similar kinetics as DNA Polymerase ε, which is present at DNA replication forks. Our results identify protein components of the pre-RC and a novel replication complex appearing at the G1/S transition (the RC), and suggest that after initiation MCM proteins and Cdc45p move with eukaryotic replication forks."

https://openalex.org/W1983963541,"Reactivation of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) results in severe disease in AIDS patients and immunocompromised patients receiving blood transfusions or organ or bone marrow grafts. Although the site of HCMV latency is unknown, blood cells have been implicated as a viral reservoir. In this study, we demonstrate HCMV reactivation in vitro from seven consecutive healthy donors through allogeneic stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). HCMV replication was detected at 17 days poststimulation, and virus was recovered after long-term culture from a macrophage expressing dendritic cell markers. Thus, these observations demonstrate that PBMCs harbor latent HCMV, which reactivates in a myeloid lineage cell upon allogeneic stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W2136602932,Distinct neuronal cell types are generated at characteristic times and positions in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. We provide evidence that the identity and pattern of generation of dorsal neurons depend initially on BMP-mediated signals that derive from the epidermal ectoderm and induce dorsal midline cells of the roof plate. Roof plate cells provide a secondary source of TGFβ-related signals that are required for the generation of distinct classes of dorsal interneurons. These inductive interactions involve both qualitative and quantitative differences in signaling by TGFβ-related factors and temporal changes in the response of neural progenitor cells.

https://openalex.org/W2046037983,"At least one essential function of Smt3p, aSaccharomyces cerevisiae ubiquitin-like protein similar to the mammalian protein SUMO-1, involves its posttranslational covalent attachment to other proteins. Using Smt3p affinity chromatography, we have isolated the second enzyme of the Smt3p conjugation pathway and have found that it is identical to Ubc9p, a previously identified protein that has extensive sequence similarity to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) and that is required for yeast to progress through mitosis. A hallmark of E2s is the ability to form a thioester bond-containing covalent intermediate with ubiquitin (Ub). While we were unable to detect formation of a Ub∼Ubc9p thioester, Ubc9p was found to form a thioester with Smt3p, indicating that Ubc9p is the functional analog of E2s in the Smt3p pathway and that this step is distinct from the ubiquitin pathway. Ubc9p is required for attachment of Smt3p to other proteins in vitro, suggesting that it is the only such enzyme in S. cerevisiae. These results suggest that, like ubiquitination, Smt3p conjugation may be a critical modification in cell cycle regulation.

SMT3 is an essential Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene encoding a member of a family of ubiquitin-like proteins, including the mammalian protein SUMO-1 (1Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L.

SUMO-1 was isolated as a protein covalently linked to the Ran-GTPase-activating protein (RanGAP1), 1The abbreviations used are: RanGAP1, Ran-GTPase-activating protein; Ub, ubiquitin; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; HF-Smt3p, His6- and FLAG-epitope-tagged mature Smt3p; DTT, dithiothreitol; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; EF1α, elongation factor 1α; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. 1The abbreviations used are: RanGAP1, Ran-GTPase-activating protein; Ub, ubiquitin; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; HF-Smt3p, His6- and FLAG-epitope-tagged mature Smt3p; DTT, dithiothreitol; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; EF1α, elongation factor 1α; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. and it is also conjugated to a number of other, primarily nuclear, proteins (1Mahajan R.

Smt3p, which is 487 identical to SUMO-1 and 177 identical to Ub, also becomes attached to several proteins posttranslationally, and at least one of its essential functions is mediated by its attachment to another protein (7Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin (Ub) conjugation is carried out by a multistep pathway culminating in formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal carboxyl group of Ub and the ε-amino group of a lysine side chain in an acceptor protein (8Pickart C.M. Rechsteiner M. Ubiquitin. Plenum Press, New York1988: 77-99Crossref Google Scholar, 9Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). In the initial step, Ub-activating enzyme (E1) utilizes ATP to adenylate the Ub C terminus, which is then transferred to a conserved Cys residue in the E1, yielding an E1∼Ub thioester, AMP, and pyrophosphate. Ub is transferred from the E1 to a Cys residue in a Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2). Cells contain multiple E2s (13 in yeast by sequence similarity) which are involved in ubiquitinating different proteins. In some cases Ub can be transferred directly from the E2 to the acceptor protein, but more often Ub-isopeptide bond formation is facilitated by a third heterogeneous class of proteins termed Ub-protein ligases or recognins (E3). Several features of the Ub pathway are conserved in the early steps of the Smt3p conjugation pathway (7Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Like Ub, the SMT3translation product is proteolytically processed to expose its mature C terminus. Smt3p undergoes ATP-dependent activation by a heterodimeric activating enzyme consisting of Uba2p, a 71-kDa protein with extensive sequence similarity to the C-terminal region of E1s, including the active site Cys residue participating in the thioester (10Dohmen R.J. Stappen R. McGrath J.P. Forrová H. Kolarov J. Goffeau A. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18099-18109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and Aos1p, a 40-kDa protein similar to the N termini of E1s (7Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). While the Smt3p- and Ub-activating enzymes are related, they do not interact with each other's substrates, suggesting that the two pathways are distinct. One candidate to be the Smt3p-conjugating enzyme is Ubc9p, a member of the E2 sequence family whose Xenopus leavis homolog co-immunoprecipitates with a complex including SUMO-1-conjugated RanGAP1 (11Saitoh H. Pu R. Cavenagh M. Dasso M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3736-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and whose human homolog interacts in a two-hybrid screen with SUMO-1 (4Shen Z. Pardington-Purtymun P.E. Comeaux J.C. Moyzis R.K. Chen D.J. Genomics. 1996; 37: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). UBC9 is an essential gene. Conditionalubc9 mutants arrest in the cell cycle at G2/M and are impaired in proteolysis of both B-type cyclins (12Seufert W. Futcher B. Jentsch S. Nature. 1995; 373: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) and G1 cyclins (13Blondel M. Mann C. Nature. 1996; 384: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, Ubc9p does not seem to be the E2 involved in cyclin B ubiquitination (14Yu H. King R.W. Peters J.M. Kirschner M.W. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 455-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 15Aristarkhov A. Eytan E. Moghe A. Admon A. Hershko A. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4294-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). While it has been suggested that Ubc9p functions as an E2 in the Ub pathway, there is no clear biochemical data to support this hypothesis. We have found that Ubc9p is a Smt3p-conjugating enzyme and that it is likely to constitute the only Smt3p-conjugating activity in yeast. Furthermore, Ubc9p does not seem to be a Ub-conjugating enzyme, suggesting that the ubc9 cell cycle defect actually results from impairment of Smt3p conjugation. Standard techniques were used (16Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1994Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae strains used were DF5α (MATα trp1–1 ura3–52 his3-Δ200 leu2–3,112 lys2–801) (17Finley D. Özkaynak E. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1987; 48: 1035-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) and the DF5-derived strain YWO102 (MATα ubc9Δ::TRP1 leu2::ubc9Pro-Ser::LEU2) (12Seufert W. Futcher B. Jentsch S. Nature. 1995; 373: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), which was a generous gift of S. Jentsch (Heidelberg, Germany). pET21b or pET11a (Novagen)-based Escherichia coli expression plasmids expressing N-terminally His6- (18Hoffman A. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6337-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and FLAG-tagged (19Brizzard B.L. Chubet R.G. Vizard D.L. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 730-734PubMed Google Scholar) Smt3p (HF-Smt3p) and His6-tagged Aos1p and Uba2p have been described (7Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). pET21b-based plasmids for expressing Ubc9p-, Ubc2p-, and Pex4p-tagged C-terminally with His6 were produced by polymerase chain reaction. The Ubc2p construct expresses Ubc2p truncated after Met153, deleting most of the acidic C-terminal domain. A pET21b-based plasmid expressing N-terminally His6- and FLAG-tagged ubiquitin bearing Lys48→ Arg, Lys63 → Arg and Gly76 → Ala mutations (HF-Ub(A76)) was also produced by polymerase chain reaction. The A76 mutation alters the kinetics of thioester formation (20Pickart C.M. Kasperek E.M. Beal R. Kim A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7115-7123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Construction details are available on request. Proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography as described (7Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The H-Uba2p·Aos1p complex was further purified by Smt3p affinity and gel filtration chromatography (7Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant Ubc4p was a generous gift of V. Chau (Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI). His6-tagged Uba1p was purified from yeast lysate of strain JD77–1A (MAT a uba1Δ::HIS3) (10Dohmen R.J. Stappen R. McGrath J.P.

Dohmen (Heinrich-Heine Universität, Düsseldorf, Germany). Uba1p was purified by Ni-NTA chromatography as described for Uba2p (7Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) followed by Ub affinity chromatography (21Ciechanover A. Elias S. Heller H. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2537-2542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ni-NTA-purified recombinant Aos1p and Uba2p were applied to an HF-Smt3p-Affi-Gel 15 column and washed as described (7Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). A few milligrams of each protein bound. Yeast nuclear extract, consisting of the soluble fractions (primarily the load) below the nuclear envelopes in a Nycodenz/sucrose flotation gradient, prepared as described (22Strambio-de-Castillia C. Blobel G. Rout M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), was a generous gift of R. Beckmann and D. Peter. Extract containing ∼20 mg of protein was dialyzed against 50 mm BisTris (pH 6.5), 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmॆ-mercaptoethanol (ॆ-ME), brought to final concentrations 50 mm BisTris (pH 6.5), 75 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm ॆ-ME and applied to the Aos1p/Uba2p-preloaded HF-Smt3p column. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of the same buffer except containing 1 m NaCl and eluted as described (7Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The eluate was exchanged into 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ॆ-ME using a Biomax-10 ultrafiltration unit (Millipore), bound to 0.5 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose, and washed with 5 column volumes of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 107 glycerol. The unbound and wash fractions were pooled and fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 4–207 gradient gel (Novex) followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Bands were excised from the gel and identified by direct analysis of a Lys-C endoproteinase digest by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry at the Rockefeller University Protein/DNA Technology Center as described (23Gharahdaghi F. Kirchner M. Fernandez J. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 233: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The six major peaks, with measured masses of 856.68, 1080.54, 1702.28, 1829.39, 2892.92, and 3463.25 Da, are within 1.6 mass units of the peptide masses predicted by a theoretical Lys-C digest of Ubc9p (using the ProFound and MS-Fit programs: http://chait-sgi.rockefeller.edu/cgi-bin/ProFoundandhttp://prospector.ucsf.edu/htmlucsf/msfit.htm), assuming the N terminus is acetylated and cysteine residues are modified by acrylamide. Thioester formation reactions contained 50 mm BisTris (pH 6.5), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT and some of the following: 5 mm ATP, 30 ॖg/ml HF-Smt3p or HF-Ub(A98), 15 ॖg/ml Aos1p/Uba2p heterodimer or Uba1p, and ∼15 ॖg/ml Ubc9p, Ubc4p, Pex4p, or Rad6p (Ubc4p and Pex4p contained noticeable amounts of contaminants). HF-Smt3p-containing reactions were incubated 30 min and HF-Ub(A76)-containing reactions 90 min at 25 °C and stopped by addition of SDS-containing loading buffer either lacking reducing agent or containing 100 mm DTT, followed by a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, SDS-PAGE (6–157 acrylamide gradient) and either Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblotting using the M2 anti-FLAG antibody (IBI/Kodak). Whole yeast cell lysate from DF5α or YWO102 (both after 90-min incubation at 37 °C) were prepared as described (7Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) and exchanged into 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm DTT using a Sephadex G-25 column. Reactions were incubated for 90 min at 25 °C and contained 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 75 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 ॖm DTT, 10 mg/ml whole yeast lysate, 30 ॖg/ml HF-Smt3p and, where indicated, 5 mm ATP and/or 5 ॖg/ml Ubc9p. E1s and E2s can be readily purified by 舠covalent affinity chromatography舡 (21Ciechanover A. Elias S. Heller H. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2537-2542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by adding ATP to a protein mixture containing these enzymes and incubating with an affinity column to which Ub has been coupled. E1s and E2s form thioester bonds with the column-bound Ub and then can be gently eluted in buffer containing a thiol reducing agent, such as DTT, which breaks the thioester bonds. We attempted an analogous approach to purifying the Smt3p-conjugating enzyme(s) using a column linked to His6 (18Hoffman A. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6337-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar)- and FLAG-tagged (19Brizzard B.L. Chubet R.G. Vizard D.L. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 730-734PubMed Google Scholar) Smt3p (HF-Smt3p) (mature processed Smt3p having C-terminal Gly98 will be referred to as Smt3p). Because the Smt3p-conjugating enzyme would be predicted to bind the column by displacing Uba2p/Aos1p, which is necessary to activate the column-bound Smt3p, the Smt3p column was prebound with recombinant His6-tagged Uba2p and Aos1p to improve the efficiency of conjugating enzyme binding. Next, ATP-supplemented yeast nuclear extract was applied to the column, which was then washed and eluted with DTT. Nuclear extract was used because Uba2p has been reported to be nuclear (10Dohmen R.J. Stappen R. McGrath J.P. Forrová H. Kolarov J. Goffeau A. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18099-18109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and because we had previously found a yeast cytosolic fraction to be inactive in Smt3p conjugation (data not shown). The eluate contained predominantly recombinant Uba2p and Aos1p (data not shown), but as these bore His6 tags, they were selectively removed by Ni-NTA chromatography. The resulting fraction contained four major bands of 90, 50, 40, and 19 kDa and a number of minor bands (Fig.1). The 90- and 40-kDa bands are likely to represent the endogenous Uba2p and Aos1p from the yeast lysate. The other two bands were analyzed by direct mass spectrometric analysis of a protease digestion mixture (see 舠Experimental Procedures舡). The 50-kDa band contained the elongation factor EF1α, and the 19-kDa band contained Ubc9p. The isolation of EF1α in this fractionation was intriguing, as EF1α has been connected to Ub-like systems before, as an isopeptidase involved in Ub-dependent proteolysis ofN-α-acetylated substrates (24Gonen H. Dickman D. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 389: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, it is also an extremely abundant protein and a frequent contaminant in affinity purifications. 2R. Beckmann, personal communication. We attempted to purify EF1α and add it to some of the reactions described below, but did not obtain any conclusive results. Smt3p-thioester formation assays were performed using purified, His6-tagged recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli. Incubation of the Uba2p/Aos1p heterodimer with ATP and HF-Smt3p promoted formation of the ∼105-kDa HF-Smt3p∼Uba2p thioester (7Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2,lane 6). When purified Ubc9p was also added to this reaction, a different HF-Smt3p-containing band formed at ∼38 kDa (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 7). In addition to Ubc9p, formation of this product required ATP, Uba2p, and Aos1p. Furthermore, the vast majority of this product could be destroyed by incubation with DTT (Fig. 2, lanes 1–8). The data are consistent with the 38-kDa product being the HF-Smt3p∼Ubc9p thioester. The DTT-sensitive bond cannot be a disulfide bond, as HF-Smt3p does not contain any cysteine residues. Coomassie Blue staining of the reaction products provided additional evidence that Ubc9p was the other component of the 38-kDa product, as the Ubc9p bands were significantly depleted upon ATP incubation and formation of the 38-kDa band and reappeared upon addition of DTT (Fig. 2, lanes 1–3; Ubc9p ran as a ∼20-kDa doublet under nonreducing conditions). Also, formation of the 38-kDa product was entirely dependent on the presence of Uba2p/Aos1p, strengthening the analogy between this reaction and that of Ub, E1s, and E2s. This reaction also formed small amounts of a series of DTT-insensitive HF-Smt3p-containing bands, one of which ran at the same position as the HF-Smt3p∼Ubc9p thioester. These bands could represent a polymer of HF-Smt3p or isopeptide-containing conjugates of Smt3p to Ubc9p. We also asked whether Ubc9p was capable of forming thioesters with Ub as well as with Smt3p. When the yeast E2s Ubc4p, Pex4p (Pas2p/Ubc10p), or Rad6p (Ubc2p), which are involved in bulk proteolysis (25Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), peroxisome biogenesis (26Wiebel F.F. Kunau W.H. Nature. 1992; 359: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and DNA repair (27Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1987; 329: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), respectively, were mixed with Uba1p (the yeast E1) and His6- and FLAG-tagged Ub(A76) (see 舠Experimental Procedures舡), addition of ATP caused these E2s to shift almost quantitatively into higher molecular weight forms (Fig. 3, lanes 1–6). These products were DTT-sensitive and contained HF-Ub(A76) (data not shown), suggesting that they were the corresponding Ub-E2 thioesters. No thioester product between Ubc9p and Ub could be detected under these conditions either by Coomassie staining (Fig. 3, lane 8) or by immunoblotting with the antibody against the FLAG epitope (Fig. 3,lane 9). Conversely, extremely little or no thioester product was detected between Smt3p and either Ubc4p, Pex4p, or Rad6p (data not shown), demonstrating that the transthiolation reaction is very specific. When HF-Smt3p and ATP were incubated with whole yeast cell lysate from wild-type cells, a series of DTT-resistant high molecular weight HF-Smt3p-containing bands formed (7Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, lane 2). The pattern of Smt3p-containing bands was similar but not identical to that seen in vivo, with a greater proportion of HF-Smt3p found in very high molecular mass bands >200 kDa (7Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Theubc9–1 mutant, which has a Ser residue in place of Pro69, is temperature-sensitive by virtue of the fact that Ubc9(P69S)p is rapidly degraded at 37 °C (28Betting J. Seufert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25790-25796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). When yeast lysate made from this mutant strain after incubation at 37 °C was used in the same reaction, no Smt3p conjugation was detected even on long exposure. (Fig. 4, lane 3). Addition of recombinant Ubc9p restored the Smt3p conjugation activity (Fig. 4, lane 4). These results suggest a direct requirement for Ubc9p in HF-Smt3p conjugation to other proteins in these lysates. Thus, Ubc9p is likely to be the only Smt3p-conjugating enzyme in yeast, at least that is expressed under normal growth conditions. Our results show that the Smt3p conjugation pathway is distinct from the Ub pathway, at least up to formation of the thioester with the conjugating enzymes. However, sequence comparisons of of the Smt3p-conjugating enzyme Ubc9p to the Ub-conjugating enzymes Rad6p (Ubc2p), Ubc4p, and Pex4p (Pas2p/Ubc10p) do not reveal any large continuous regions of dissimilarity, and the degree of sequence similarity between Ubc9p and any of these three E2s is comparable with that among the E2s. Ubc4p is 377 identical to Ubc2p, 357 identical to Pex4p, and 347 identical to Ubc9p. Yet the transthiolation reaction involving Aos1p/Uba2p and Smt3p is extremely selective for Ubc9p, and the reaction involving Uba1p and Ub selects strongly against Ubc9p. One possible factor in this discrimination may be that Ubc9p is much more basic than the other proteins, with a pI of 9.2 as compared with 6.3 for Ubc4p, 5.4 for Pex4p, or 4.0 for Rad6p. How this specificity is generated depends on whether conjugating enzymes interact directly with the activating enzyme, the Ub-like protein, or both. Although our inability to detect Ub∼Ubc9p thioesters does not prove that Ubc9p never participates in Ub conjugation in vivo, it is unlikely that the metabolic stabilization of cyclins observed inubc9 mutants (12Seufert W. Futcher B. Jentsch S. Nature. 1995; 373: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 13Blondel M. Mann C. Nature. 1996; 384: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) results directly from reduced ubiquitination of these proteins by Ubc9p, both because of our results and because the E2s that participate in cyclin B ubiquitination have been isolated and do not include Ubc9p (14Yu H. King R.W. Peters J.M. Kirschner M.W. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 455-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 15Aristarkhov A. Eytan E. Moghe A. Admon A. Hershko A. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4294-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It is also very unlikely that Smt3p conjugation substitutes for ubiquitination in targeting cyclins for proteolysis, as cyclins have been heavily studied and never found to be Smt3p-conjugated. Furthermore, Smt3p, which is only 177 identical to Ub, probably does not target its substrates for proteasome-dependent proteolysis. Smt3p conjugation could affect cyclin proteolysis by activating some component of the ubiquitination/proteolysis machinery, or its effect could be several steps removed from ubiquitination. It also has not been excluded that Ubc9p could be required for the conjugation of a different Ub-like protein, which could mediate the cell cycle effect. Smt3p, Aos1p, and Uba2p are all essential genes (7Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 10Dohmen R.J. Stappen R.

AP-1 and AP-2 mediate protein sorting at the trans-Golgi network and plasma membrane, respectively, whereas the function of AP-3 has not been defined. A screen for factors specifically involved in transport of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) from the Golgi to the vacuole/lysosome has identified Apl6p and Apl5p of the yeast AP-3 complex. Deletion of each of the four AP-3 subunits results in selective mislocalization of ALP and the vacuolar t-SNARE, Vam3p (but not CPS and CPY), while deletion of AP-1 and AP-2 subunits has no effect on vacuolar protein delivery. This study, therefore, provides evidence that the AP-3 complex functions in cargo-selective protein transport from the Golgi to the vacuole/lysosome."

The neural mechanisms by which this form of rapid perceptual learning facilitates perception are not well understood. Psychological theory suggests the involvement of systems for processing stimulus attributes, spatial attention and feature binding, as well as those involved in visual imagery. Here we investigate where and how this rapid perceptual learning is expressed in the human brain by using functional neuroimaging to measure brain activity during exposure to degraded images before and after exposure to the corresponding undegraded versions. Perceptual learning of faces or objects enhanced the activity of inferior temporal regions known to be involved in face and object recognition respectively. In addition, both face and object learning led to increased activity in medial and lateral parietal regions that have been implicated in attention and visual imagery. We observed a strong coupling between the temporal face area and the medial parietal cortex when, and only when, faces were perceived. This suggests that perceptual learning involves direct interactions between areas involved in face recognition and those involved in spatial attention, feature binding and memory recall."

By contrast, the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) isoform has been invoked as a potential pathogenic enzyme in numerous inflammatory diseases. The objective of this study was to determine whether the iNOS isoform is also capable of functioning as a regulator of leukocyte recruitment. Mice received endotoxin (LPS, 30 microg/kg, i.v.); 2-4 h later, intravital microscopy was used to examine leukocyte rolling and adhesion in postcapillary venules of the cremaster muscle and the sinusoids and postsinusoidal venules of the hepatic microcirculation. Leukocyte recruitment into the lung was also examined. RT-PCR confirmed that this treatment induced iNOS mRNA expression in wild-type mice as early as 2 h after LPS treatment. Between 2 and 4 h after LPS administration, the number of rolling and adherent leukocytes in cremasteric postcapillary venules and of adherent cells in liver postsinusoidal venules of iNOS-deficient mice were significantly higher than in wild-type mice. Leukocyte accumulation in the lung (measured by myeloperoxidase assay) was also significantly elevated in iNOS-deficient animals. These effects could not be attributed to differences in systemic blood pressure, shear rates, circulating leukocyte numbers, or baseline levels of rolling and adhesion because these parameters were not different between the two groups. To establish whether the differences in leukocyte recruitment were related to the leukocytes per se, perfusion of iNOS+/+ or iNOS-/- septic blood over purified E-selectin (using parallel plate flow chambers) revealed much larger recruitment of iNOS-/- leukocytes. These results suggest that iNOS induced in response to LPS releases NO that is capable of reducing leukocyte accumulation by affecting leukocytes directly and raises the possibility that induction of iNOS is a homeostatic regulator for leukocyte recruitment."

https://openalex.org/W1553616550,"The biological activity of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β) is controlled by its secretion as a latent complex in which it is noncovalently associated with latency-associated peptide (LAP). Activation is the extracellular process in which TGF-β is released from LAP, and is considered to be a primary regulatory control. We recently reported rapid and persistent changes in TGF-β immunoreactivity in conjunction with extracellular matrix remodeling in γ-irradiated mouse mammary gland. Our hypothesis is that these specific changes in immunoreactivity are indicative of latent TGF-β activation. In the present study, we determined the radiation dose response and tested whether a functional relationship exists between radiation-induced TGF-β and collagen type III remodeling. After radiation exposures as low as 0.1 Gy, we detected increased TGF-β immunoreactivity in the mammary epithelium concomitant with decreased LAP immunostaining, which are events consistent with activation. Quantitative image analysis demonstrated a significant (P= 0.0005) response at 0.1 Gy without an apparent threshold and a linear dose response to 5 Gy. However, in the adipose stroma, loss of LAP demonstrated a qualitative threshold at 0.5 Gy. Loss of LAP paralleled induction of collagen III immunoreactivity in this tissue compartment. We tested whether TGF-β mediates collagen III expression by treating animals with TGF-β panspecific monoclonal antibody, 1D11.16, administered i.p. shortly before irradiation. Radiation-induced collagen III staining in the adipose stroma was blocked in an antibody dose-dependent manner, which persisted through 7 days postirradiation. RN-ase protection assay revealed that radiation-induced elevation of total gland collagen III mRNA was also blocked by neutralizing antibody treatment. These data provide functional confirmation of the hypothesis that radiation exposure leads to latent TGF-β activation, support our interpretation of the reciprocal shift in immunoreactivity as evidence of activation, and implicate TGF-β as a mediator of tissue response to ionizing radiation. The sensitivity of activation to low radiation doses points to a potential role for TGF-β in orchestrating tissue response to oxidative stress. As such, radiation may be useful as a probe to delineate the consequences of latent TGF-β activation in situ.—Ehrhart, E. J., Segarini, P., Tsang, M. L.-S., Carroll, A. G., Barcellos-Hoff, M. H.

Transfection studies reveal that TRF can differentially mediate activation by some enhancer proteins but not others. Like TBP, TRF forms a stable complex containing multiple novel subunits, nTAFs. Antibody staining of embryos and polytene chromosomes reveals cell type-specific expression and gene-selective properties consistent with the shaker/male sterile phenotype of trf mutants.

We conducted a study to evaluate the occurrence of oxidative DNA damage and formation of DNA adducts in human atherosclerotic lesions and to assess the relationships of these promutagenic alterations with exposure to atherogenic risk factors. Pure DNA was extracted from the tunica media (composed mainly of smooth muscle cells) of abdominal aorta fragments taken at surgery from 85 patients suffering from severe atherosclerotic lesions. DNA adducts were detected by synchronous fluorescence spectrophotometry and 32P postlabeling after enrichment of adducts with either butanol or nuclease P1. 8-Hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), a typical indicator of oxidative DNA damage, was measured by HPLC/electrochemical detection. A complete questionnaire reporting general, clinical, and laboratory characteristics was available for each patient. All 84 samples tested by 32P postlabeling were positive by displaying the presence of diagonal radioactive zones and up to 9 individual DNA adducts. Of 52 samples tested, 32 (61.5%) yielded typical positive signals at synchronous fluorescence spectrophotometry. All but one of 39 samples tested had very high levels of 8-OH-dG, thus showing a remarkable oxidative DNA damage. Statistically significant correlations were found between the levels of molecular biomarkers and atherogenic risk factors including age, number of currently smoked cigarettes, ratio of total-to-high density lipoprotein blood cholesterol, blood triglycerides, and blood pressure. The DNA alterations detected in our study may be only one component of the genetic basis of atherogenesis. Moreover, no causal role in the atherogenetic process can be inferred from our results. However, DNA alterations, including oxidative damage and adduction of reactive molecules of either endogenous or exogenous source, were systematically present in the smooth muscle cells of human atherosclerotic lesions and their intensity was significantly correlated with the occurrence of atherogenic risk factors in the patients studied.—De Flora, S., Izzotti, A., Walsh, D., Degan, P., Petrilli, G.

We introduced the human bcl-2 gene into a low bcl-2 expressing human breast cancer cell line MCF7 ADR. We demonstrate that two bcl-2 overexpressing clones injected intravenously or intramuscularly into nude mice induce a significantly higher number of experimental and spontaneous lung metastases compared to the control transfectant clone. We demonstrate that bcl-2 overexpressing clones are more invasive and migratory in response to chemotactic stimuli than the control transfectant clone. Furthermore, zymographic analysis shows that secretion of 72 and 92 kDa gelatinases increases in the two bcl-2 overexpressing transfectants. Tumors originating from bcl-2 overexpressing clones also show a decrease in the latency period of tumor appearance. In conclusion, our data show that bcl-2 overexpression enhances both tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of MCF7 ADR cells by inducing metastasis-associated properties."

Here we report that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), via generation of hydroxyl radical, inactivates liver MAT by reversibly and covalently oxidizing an enzyme site. In vitro studies using pure liver recombinant enzyme and mutants of MAT, where each of the 10 cysteine residues of the enzyme subunit were individually changed to serine by site-directed mutagenesis, identified cysteine 121 as the site of molecular interaction between H2O2 and liver MAT. Cysteine 121 is specific to the hepatic enzyme and is localized at a ""flexible loop"" over the active site cleft of MAT. In vivo studies, using wild-type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and CHO cells stably expressing liver MAT, demonstrate that the inactivation of MAT by H2O2 is specific to the hepatic enzyme, resulting from the modification of the cysteine residue 121, and that this effect is mediated by the generation of the hydroxyl radical. Our results suggest that H2O2-induced MAT inactivation might be the cause of reduced MAT activity and abnormal methionine metabolism observed in patients with alcoholic liver disease."

The NPM-ALK chimeric gene is an activated tyrosine kinase that has been shown to be a potent oncogene. We have developed a cellular model for the study of p80 action in rat 1a fibroblasts. Expression of cDNA's encoding NPM-ALK (p80) in rat 1a fibroblasts induces anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and promotes foci formation in culture. Cells expressing exogenous p80 showed significantly increased proliferation characterized by accelerated cell cycle entry into S-phase. Consistent with increased G0/G1 to S-phase transition, there is also marked up-regulation of cyclin A and cyclin D1 expression. In addition, p80 transformed cells showed elevated expression of several immediate early genes involved in cellular proliferation, including fos, jun, and c-myc. DNA binding analysis of nuclear extracts prepared from p80 transformed cells reveal marked up-regulation of AP-1 DNA binding activity. Functional AP-1-specific transfection assays also show up-regulation of AP-1-dependent transcriptional activation.

The vesicular concentration increase was time dependent and the substrates were not metabolized to any extent during the transport experiments. The saturation curve indicates the existence of kinetic and allosteric cooperativity during Ap(n)A (diadenosine polyphosphates) transport and could be the result of the presence of various affinity states of the transporter with K values of 16 +/- 1 microM and 75 +/- 6 microM, and corresponding Hill numbers of 2 and 4, when epsilon-(Ap4A) was the substrate. The saturation studies for [3H]Ap5A were performed in a broader concentration range; in this case a three-step curve was obtained with K values of 16 +/- 2 microM, 125 +/- 9 microM, and 545 +/- 11 microM; the corresponding Hill numbers were 2, 4, and 6. This kinetic behavior can be explained on the basis of a mnemonic model, as already demonstrated for the vesicular transport of ATP. The nonhydrolyzable adenine nucleotide analogs, ATPgammaS and ADPbetaS, inhibited the diadenosine polyphosphate transport at concentrations in the millimolar range.

Glucose uptake, determined by the phosphorylation of the intravenously injected [14C]2-deoxyglucose, was found to decrease in the heart and skeletal muscle of epinephrine-infused rats. Glycogen in livers, skeletal muscles, and hearts of the epinephrine-infused rats decreased to varying degrees relative to the saline-infused rats, indicating enhanced giycogenolysis in all three organs.

However, it is not known whether thymopoietin affects thymic epithelial cell (TEC) functions. In this study we have examined the effect of a five amino acid active peptide (TP5), corresponding to amino acids 32-36 of TP, on the proliferation of nontransformed clones of human TEC. Our results indicate that TP5 induced reinitiation of DNA synthesis and potentiated fetal calf serum (FCS)-induced cell growth in postnatal and fetal-derived human TEC. We also found that TEC lines express high levels of endopeptidase 24.11, a cell-surface metallopeptidase also known as the CD10 antigen. We show that TP5 is cleaved by CD10 at the surface of TEC lines, indicating that this endopeptidase may regulate TP5-induced TEC proliferation. Phosphoramidon, a specific endopeptidase 24.11 inhibitor, consistently acts in synergy with TP5 to enhance FCS-induced TEC growth. Hence, we conclude that 1) TP5 alone or in combination with FCS supports the growth of TEC lines, and 2) TEC lines express high levels of CD10, which regulates TP5-induced TEC proliferation by acting as a thymic peptide degrading enzyme."
