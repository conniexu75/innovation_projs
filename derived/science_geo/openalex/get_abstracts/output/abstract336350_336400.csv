https://openalex.org/W2023439806,"As a result of research carried out over the past decade, eastern North America now provides one of the most detailed records of the origins of agriculture available. Spanning a filll three millennia, the transition from forager to farmer in eastern North America involved the domestication of four North American seed plants during the second millennium B.C., the initial emergence of food production economies based on local crop plants between 250 B.C. and A.D. 200, and the rapid and broad-scale shift to maize-centered agriculture during the three centuries from A.D. 800 to 1100."
https://openalex.org/W2001579336,"Measurements of ice-sheet elevation change by satellite altimetry show that the Greenland surface elevation south of 72 degrees north latitude is increasing. The vertical velocity of the surface is 0.20 +/- 0.06 meters per year from measured changes in surface elevations at 5906 intersections between Geosat paths in 1985 and Seasat in 1978, and 0.28 +/- 0.02 meters per year from 256,694 intersections of Geosat paths during a 548-day period of 1985 to 1986."
https://openalex.org/W2117874589,"An observed 0.23 m/year thickening of the Greenland ice sheet indicates a 25% to 45% excess ice accumulation over the amount required to balance the outward ice flow. The implied global sea-level depletion is 0.2 to 0.4 mm/year, depending on whether the thickening is only recent (5 to 10 years) or longer term (< 100 years). If there is a similar imbalance in the northern 60% of the ice-sheet area, the depletion is 0.35 to 0.7 mm/year. Increasing ice thickness suggests that the precipitation is higher than the long-term average; higher precipitation may be a characteristic of warmer climates in polar regions."

The pressure is a universal thermodynamic function in the limit of thick films. It may be responsible for frost heave in frozen ground."
https://openalex.org/W2048564222,"Quantitative information may be extracted from local areas of images that consist of one or more types of unit cell. Fourier-space analysis, real-space intensity analysis, and real-space vector pattern recognition are discussed. The pattern recognition approach efficiently exploits the available information by representing the intensity distribution within each unit cell of the image as a multidimensional vector. Thus, the amount and the effect of noise present are determined, statistically significant features are identified, and quantitative comparisons are made with model images. In the case of chemical lattice images, the position of a vector can be directly related to the atomic composition of the unit cell it represents, allowing quantitative chemical mapping of materials at near-atomic sensitivity and resolution. More generally, the vector approach allows the efficient and quantitative extraction of information from images, which consist of mosaics of unit cells."
https://openalex.org/W2079098981,High-speed x-ray cine films synchronized with intra-pleuroperitoneal pressure measurements show that polypterid fishes aspiration breathe by the deformation and recoil of their bony-scaled integument. Paleozoic amphibians arose from ancient air-breathing fishes and retained piscine bony scales in V-shaped rows along the belly. These scales resemble those of modern polypterid fishes and may have contributed to inhalation by elastic recoil. The discovery that polypterid fishes breathe by recoil aspiration is the first evidence for aspiration breathing in any lower vertebrate. The use of recoil aspiration by polypterids shows that elastic storage in a stiff body wall can contribute to inhalation in animals with limited capacity for active aspiration.

https://openalex.org/W3112886307,"Geophysics is closing out the 1980s with a bang. October's Loma Prieta earthquake grabbed the spotlight at this month's American Geophysical Union's annual fall meeting in, of all places, San Francisco; the quake also closed down one of the official hotels, depriving hundreds of the 4500 attendees of rooms. Other hot topics of the late 1980s—Voyager's tour of the outer solar system and the greenhouse effect—got their share of attention as well."

Language accompanying the energy and water appropriation bill for fiscal year 1988 indicates that the committee is concerned that pressure to cut the federal deficit will impair the government's ability to fund some major new nuclear and high energy physics experiments in future years. The committee provided $35 million in research funds for the SSC to keep the design team together and support other nonsite activities for one more year. As for the CIT program, the Senate Committee says the hydrogen plasma ignition machine should be delayed . . .Starting this project implies a commitment to provide additional funds in subsequent years which the committee is unable to make at this time."
