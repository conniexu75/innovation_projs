https://openalex.org/W1993933064,"The Day Reconstruction Method (DRM) assesses how people spend their time and how they experience the various activities and settings of their lives, combining features of time-budget measurement and experience sampling. Participants systematically reconstruct their activities and experiences of the preceding day with procedures designed to reduce recall biases. The DRM's utility is shown by documenting close correspondences between the DRM reports of 909 employed women and established results from experience sampling. An analysis of the hedonic treadmill shows the DRM's potential for well-being research."

In this Essay,
 Oreskes
 analyzes the existing scientific literature to show that there is a robust consensus that anthropogenic global climate change is occurring. Thus, despite claims sometimes made by some groups that there is not good evidence that Earth9s climate is being affected by human activities, the scientific community is in overwhelming agreement that such evidence is clear and persuasive."
https://openalex.org/W2121006557,"Sedimentary rocks at Eagle crater in Meridiani Planum are composed of fine-grained siliciclastic materials derived from weathering of basaltic rocks, sulfate minerals (including magnesium sulfate and jarosite) that constitute several tens of percent of the rock by weight, and hematite. Cross-stratification observed in rock outcrops indicates eolian and aqueous transport. Diagenetic features include hematite-rich concretions and crystal-mold vugs. We interpret the rocks to be a mixture of chemical and siliciclastic sediments with a complex diagenetic history. The environmental conditions that they record include episodic inundation by shallow surface water, evaporation, and desiccation. The geologic record at Meridiani Planum suggests that conditions were suitable for biological activity for a period of time in martian history."
https://openalex.org/W1978751572,"The degradation of undesirable cellular components or organelles, including invading microbes, by autophagy is crucial for cell survival. Here, Shigella , an invasive bacteria, was found to be able to escape autophagy by secreting IcsB by means of the type III secretion system. Mutant bacteria lacking IcsB were trapped by autophagy during multiplication within the host cells. IcsB did not directly inhibit autophagy. Rather, Shigella VirG, a protein required for intracellular actin-based motility, induced autophagy by binding to the autophagy protein, Atg5. In nonmutant Shigella , this binding is competitively inhibited by IcsB binding to VirG."
https://openalex.org/W2151171163,"Mössbauer spectra measured by the Opportunity rover revealed four mineralogical components in Meridiani Planum at Eagle crater: jarosite- and hematite-rich outcrop, hematite-rich soil, olivine-bearing basaltic soil, and a pyroxene-bearing basaltic rock (Bounce rock). Spherules, interpreted to be concretions, are hematite-rich and dispersed throughout the outcrop. Hematitic soils both within and outside Eagle crater are dominated by spherules and their fragments. Olivine-bearing basaltic soil is present throughout the region. Bounce rock is probably an impact erratic. Because jarosite is a hydroxide sulfate mineral, its presence at Meridiani Planum is mineralogical evidence for aqueous processes on Mars, probably under acid-sulfate conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2138876243,"Benzene is known to have toxic effects on the blood and bone marrow, but its impact at levels below the U.S. occupational standard of 1 part per million (ppm) remains uncertain. In a study of 250 workers exposed to benzene, white blood cell and platelet counts were significantly lower than in 140 controls, even for exposure below 1 ppm in air. Progenitor cell colony formation significantly declined with increasing benzene exposure and was more sensitive to the effects of benzene than was the number of mature blood cells. Two genetic variants in key metabolizing enzymes, myeloperoxidase and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, influenced susceptibility to benzene hematotoxicity. Thus, hematotoxicity from exposure to benzene occurred at air levels of 1 ppm or less and may be particularly evident among genetically susceptible subpopulations."
https://openalex.org/W2144415368,"The Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity has investigated the landing site in Eagle crater and the nearby plains within Meridiani Planum. The soils consist of fine-grained basaltic sand and a surface lag of hematite-rich spherules, spherule fragments, and other granules. Wind ripples are common. Underlying the thin soil layer, and exposed within small impact craters and troughs, are flat-lying sedimentary rocks. These rocks are finely laminated, are rich in sulfur, and contain abundant sulfate salts. Small-scale cross-lamination in some locations provides evidence for deposition in flowing liquid water. We interpret the rocks to be a mixture of chemical and siliciclastic sediments formed by episodic inundation by shallow surface water, followed by evaporation, exposure, and desiccation. Hematite-rich spherules are embedded in the rock and eroding from them. We interpret these spherules to be concretions formed by postdepositional diagenesis, again involving liquid water."

https://openalex.org/W1919635784,"A continuous high-resolution Western Mediterranean sea surface temperature (SST) alkenone record spanning the past 250,000 years shows that abrupt changes were more common at warming than at cooling. During marine isotope stage (MIS) 6, SST oscillated following a stadial-interstadial pattern but at lower intensities and rates of change than in the Dansgaard/Oeschger events of MIS 3. Some of the most prominent events occurred over MISs 5 and 7, after prolonged warm periods of high stability. Climate during the whole period was predominantly maintained in interglacial-interstadial conditions, whereas the duration of stadials was much shorter."
https://openalex.org/W2171242011,"The Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer on the Opportunity rover determined major and minor elements of soils and rocks in Meridiani Planum. Chemical compositions differentiate between basaltic rocks, evaporite-rich rocks, basaltic soils, and hematite-rich soils. Although soils are compositionally similar to those at previous landing sites, differences in iron and some minor element concentrations signify the addition of local components. Rocky outcrops are rich in sulfur and variably enriched in bromine relative to chlorine. The interaction with water in the past is indicated by the chemical features in rocks and soils at this site."
https://openalex.org/W2135823274,"The Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES) on Opportunity investigated the mineral abundances and compositions of outcrops, rocks, and soils at Meridiani Planum. Coarse crystalline hematite and olivine-rich basaltic sands were observed as predicted from orbital TES spectroscopy. Outcrops of aqueous origin are composed of 15 to 35% by volume magnesium and calcium sulfates [a high-silica component modeled as a combination of glass, feldspar, and sheet silicates (â¼20 to 30%)], and hematite; only minor jarosite is identified in Mini-TES spectra. Mini-TES spectra show only a hematite signature in the millimeter-sized spherules. Basaltic materials have more plagioclase than pyroxene, contain olivine, and are similar in inferred mineral composition to basalt mapped from orbit. Bounce rock is dominated by clinopyroxene and is close in inferred mineral composition to the basaltic martian meteorites. Bright wind streak material matches global dust. Waterlain rocks covered by unaltered basaltic sands suggest a change from an aqueous environment to one dominated by physical weathering."
https://openalex.org/W2086735239,"DNA photolyases use light energy to repair DNA that comprises ultraviolet-induced lesions such as the cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). Here we report the crystal structure of a DNA photolyase bound to duplex DNA that is bent by 50° and comprises a synthetic CPD lesion. This CPD lesion is flipped into the active site and split there into two thymines by synchrotron radiation at 100 K. Although photolyases catalyze blue light–driven CPD cleavage only above 200 K, this structure apparently mimics a structural substate during light-driven DNA repair in which back-flipping of the thymines into duplex DNA has not yet taken place."
https://openalex.org/W2005935512,"We present experimental and theoretical evidence for an excited-state deactivation mechanism specific to hydrogen-bonded aromatic dimers, which may account, in part, for the photostability of the Watson-Crick base pairs in DNA. Femtosecond time-resolved mass spectroscopy of 2-aminopyridine clusters reveals an excited-state lifetime of 65 ± 10 picoseconds for the near-planar hydrogen-bonded dimer, which is significantly shorter than the lifetime of either the monomer or the 3- and 4-membered nonplanar clusters. Ab initio calculations of reaction pathways and potential-energy profiles identify the mechanism of the enhanced excited-state decay of the dimer: Conical intersections connect the locally excited 1 ππ* state and the electronic ground state with a 1 ππ* charge-transfer state that is strongly stabilized by the transfer of a proton."

https://openalex.org/W1966556007,"Abeta peptide is the major proteinateous component of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and is regarded by many as the culprit of the disorder. It is well documented that brain lipids are intricately involved in Abeta-related pathogenic pathways. An important modulator of lipid homeostasis is the pluripotent peptide leptin. Here we demonstrate leptin's ability to modify Abeta levels in vitro and in vivo. Similar to methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, leptin reduces beta-secretase activity in neuronal cells possibly by altering the lipid composition of membrane lipid rafts. This phenotype contrasts treatments with cholesterol and etomoxir, an inhibitor of carnitine-palmitoyl transferase-1. Conversely, inhibitors of acetyl CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase mimicked leptin's action. Leptin was also able to increase apoE-dependent Abeta uptake in vitro. Thus, leptin can modulate bidirectional Abeta kinesis, reducing its levels extracellularly. Most strikingly, chronic administration of leptin to AD-transgenic animals reduced the brain Abeta load, underlying its therapeutic potential."

https://openalex.org/W2025192776,"Reversible structural changes of a nanostructure were measured nondestructively with subpicometer spatial and subpicosecond temporal resolution via x-ray diffraction (XRD). The spatially periodic femtosecond excitation of a gallium arsenide/aluminum gallium arsenide superlattice results in coherent lattice motions with a 3.5-picosecond period, which was directly monitored by femtosecond x-ray pulses at a 1-kilohertz repetition rate. Small changes (DeltaR/R = 0.01) of weak Bragg reflexes (R = 0.005) were detected. The phase and amplitude of the oscillatory XRD signal around a new equilibrium demonstrate that displacive excitation of the zone-folded acoustic phonons is the dominant mechanism for strong excitation."
https://openalex.org/W2112289418,"A visible atmospheric optical depth of 0.9 was measured by the Spirit rover at Gusev crater and by the Opportunity rover at Meridiani Planum. Optical depth decreased by about 0.6 to 0.7% per sol through both 90-sol primary missions. The vertical distribution of atmospheric dust at Gusev crater was consistent with uniform mixing, with a measured scale height of 11.56 ± 0.62 kilometers. The dust's cross section weighted mean radius was 1.47 ± 0.21 micrometers (μm) at Gusev and 1.52 ± 0.18 μ at Meridiani. Comparison of visible optical depths with 9-μ optical depths shows a visible-to-infrared optical depth ratio of 2.0 ± 0.2 for comparison with previous monitoring of infrared optical depths."
https://openalex.org/W1970076607,"Direct atomic resolution images have been obtained that illustrate how a range of rare-earth atoms bond to the interface between the intergranular phase and the matrix grains in an advanced silicon nitride ceramic. It has been found that each rare-earth atom bonds to the interface at a different location, depending on atom size, electronic configuration, and the presence of oxygen at the interface. This is the key factor to understanding the origin of the mechanical properties in these ceramics and will enable precise tailoring in the future to critically improve the materials' performance in wide-ranging applications."
https://openalex.org/W2089076186,"Disturbances in endothelial cell (EC) barrier regulation are critically dependent upon rearrangements of EC actin cytoskeleton. However, the role of microtubule (MT) network in the regulation of EC permeability is not well understood. We examined involvement of MT remodeling in thrombin-induced EC permeability and explored MT regulation by heterotrimeric G12/13 proteins and by small GTPase Rho. Thrombin induced phosphorylation of MT regulatory protein tau at Ser409 and Ser262 and peripheral MT disassembly, which was linked to increased EC permeability. MT stabilization by taxol attenuated thrombin-induced permeability, actin remodeling, and paracellular gap formation and diminished thrombin-induced activation of Rho and Rho-kinase. Expression of activated Galpha12/13 subunits involved in thrombin-mediated signaling or their effector p115RhoGEF involved in Rho activation caused MT disassembly, whereas p115RhoGEF-specific negative regulator RGS preserved MT from thrombin-induced disassembly. Consistent with these results, expression of activated RhoA and Rho-kinase induced MT disassembly. Conversely, thrombin-induced disassembly of peripheral MT network was attenuated by expression of dominant negative RhoA and Rho-kinase mutants or by pharmacological inhibition of Rho-kinase. Collectively, our data demonstrate for the first time a critical involvement of MT disassembly in thrombin-induced EC barrier dysfunction and indicate G-protein-dependent mechanisms of thrombin-induced MT alteration."
https://openalex.org/W2064438537,"ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) and Arf-like (Arl) proteins are a family of highly conserved 21 kDa GTPases that emerged early in the evolution of eukaryotes. These proteins serve regulatory roles in vesicular traffic, lipid metabolism, microtubule dynamics, development, and likely other cellular processes. We found evidence for the presence of 6 Arf family members in the protist Giardia lamblia and 22 members in mammals. A phylogenetic analysis was performed to delineate the evolutionary relationships among Arf family members and to attempt to organize them by both their evolutionary origins and functions in cells and/or organisms. The ∼100 protein sequences analyzed from animals, fungi, plants, and protists clustered into 11 groups, including Arfs, nine Arls, and Sar proteins. To begin functional analyses of the family in a metazoan model organism, we examined roles for all three C. elegans Arfs (Arf-1, Arf-3, and Arf-6) and three Arls (Arl-1, Arl-2, and Arl-3) by use of RNA-mediated interference (RNAi). ..."
https://openalex.org/W2087638509,"It is well established that cardiac failure increases cardiac B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) expression due to myocardial stretching. However, patients with ischemic heart disease also display increased plasma BNP and proBNP concentrations despite preserved cardiac function. In this study, we examined whether acute myocardial hypoxia increases cardiac BNP expression. Surgical reduction of the blood flow to an area of the anterior ventricular wall in pigs reduced the myocardial oxygen tension from 46 +/- 4 to 13 +/- 5 mmHg. The tissue contents of VEGF and BNP mRNA increased 1.8-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively (n=10, P<0.005) in hypoxic compared with normoxic ventricular myocardium after 2.2 +/- 0.2 h; the magnitude of the increase in BNP mRNA expression was positively correlated with that of VEGF in hypoxic myocardium (r=0.66, P<0.05). In support of a hypoxia-induced increase of BNP gene transcription, the content of a premature BNP mRNA was increased in hypoxic myocardium (4.8-fold, P<0.005) and in freshly harvested ventricular myocytes when kept in culture flasks and oxygen-deprived for 3 h (2.2-fold, P=0.002). ProBNP peptide accumulated in the medium of freshly harvested ventricular myocyte cultures but was undetectable in ventricular myocardium, indicating rapid release of the newly synthesized proBNP peptide. Accordingly, the plasma proBNP concentration increased after 2 h of myocardial hypoxia (P=0.028). Cumulatively, the data suggest that acute hypoxia stimulates cardiac BNP expression."
https://openalex.org/W2073225572,"The near-ubiquity of sexual reproduction in animal species has long been considered a paradox because sexually reproducing individuals transmit only half of their genome to their progeny. Here, we show that the ant Cataglyphis cursor circumvents this cost by using alternative modes of reproduction for the production of reproductive and nonreproductive offspring. New queens are almost exclusively produced by parthenogenesis, whereas workers are produced by normal sexual reproduction. By selectively using sex for somatic growth and parthenogenesis for germline production, C. cursor has taken advantage of the ant caste system to benefit from the advantages of both sexual and asexual reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W2008596475,"Foraminiferal oxygen isotope and pollen analyses from a deep-sea sequence off southwest Portugal show that the duration of temperate stages on land over the past 350,000 years varied considerably. The record shows forest contractions during intervals of low ice volume, coeval with declines in atmospheric methane, after which tree populations did not always recover. What emerges is that, although the broad timing of interglacials is consistent with orbital theory, their specific duration may be dictated by millennial variability. This complicates the prediction of the natural duration of interglacials, at least until the origin of this climate variability is understood."
https://openalex.org/W2103602099,"Serum amyloid A protein (SAA) is an acute-phase reactant, known to mediate pro-inflammatory cellular responses. This study reports that CLA-1 (CD36 and LIMPII Analogous-1; human orthologue of the Scavenger Receptor Class B Type I (SR-BI)) mediates SAA uptake and downstream SAA signaling. Flow cytometry experiments revealed more than a 5-fold increase of Alexa-488 SAA uptake in HeLa cells stably transfected with CLA-1. Alexa 488-HDL uptake directly correlated with SAA uptake when determined in several CLA-1 stably transfected HeLa cell clones expressing various levels of CLA-1.

SAA was co-internalized with transferrin to the endocytic recycling compartment pointing to a potential site of SAA metabolism. Alexa-488 SAA uptake in the CLA-1-overexpressing HeLa cells, as well as in THP-1 monocyte cell line, can be efficiently blocked by unlabeled SAA, high density lipoprotein, and other CLA-1 ligands. At the same time, markedly enhanced levels of phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), ERK1/2, and p38, were observed in cells stably transfected with CLA-1 cells following SAA stimulation when compared with mock transfected cells. The levels of the SAA-induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion by CLA-1-overexpressing cells also significantly exceeded (5- to 10-fold) those detected for control cells. Synthetic amphipathic peptides possessing a structural α-helical motif inhibited SAA-induced activation of both MAPKs and IL-8 secretion in THP-1 cells.

Sipe J.D. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 225: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and in synovial tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (11Kumon Y. Suehiro T. Hashimoto K. Nakatani K.

Multiple studies have demonstrated a significant association of altered SAA levels with several pathological states, particularly chronic inflammatory diseases such as secondary amyloidosis (12Pepys M.B.

Prolonged or repeated inflammatory conditions leading to elevated serum SAA levels can cause a reactive form of amyloidosis in peripheral tissues, resulting in progressive loss of organ function. SAA fragments resulting from the enzymatic degradation of SAA form amyloid A, a major constituent of amyloid fibrils (13Husebekk A. Skogen B. Husby G. Marhaug G. Scand. J. Immunol. 1985; 21: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 14Uhlar C.M. Whitehead A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 15Tape C. Tan R. Nesheim M. Kisilevsky R. Scand. J. Immunol. 1988; 28: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In atherosclerosis, SAA accumulates in macrophages, macrophage-derived “foam cells,” adipocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells within the vascular plaque (9Meek R.L. Urieli-Shoval S. Benditt E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3186-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The exact role of SAA in atherogenesis is complicated by its effect upon the metabolism of HDL and other lipoprotein fractions (16Banka C.L. Yuan T. de Beer M.C. Kindy M. Curtiss L.K. de Beer F.C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1058-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cabana V.G. Siegel J.N. Sabesin S.M. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 39-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At lower levels, SAA associates with HDL forming a heterogeneous HDL population containing both SAA and apoA-I. At elevated concentrations, SAA displaces apoA-I and produces lipoprotein fractions containing predominantly SAA, lipid-poor apoA-I, and lipoprotein-free SAA. Persistently high SAA levels are usually associated with significantly reduced apoA-I and HDL cholesterol levels due to enhanced HDL metabolism (18Salazar A. Mana J. Fiol C. Hurtado I. Argimon J.M.

Jeenah M.S. de Beer F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9644-9651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SAA may also act as a signal for redirecting HDL to the sites of tissue destruction and cholesterol accumulation (20Kisilevsky R. Subrahmanyan L. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 778-785PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally SAA may contribute to HDL-mediated clearance of cellular cholesterol by modulating LCAT activity (21Steinmetz A. Hocke G. Saile R. Puchois P. Fruchart J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1006: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, SAA has been shown to modulate cholesterol transport by serving as a cholesterol-binding protein (22Liang J.S. Sipe J.D. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 37-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as a direct activator of the ABCA1-dependent pathway of cholesterol translocation to an extracellular cholesterol acceptor (23Tam S.P. Flexman A. Hulme J. Kisilevsky R. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1410-1420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). SAA in its lipid-poor form has been shown to modify immune responses. In vitro studies have provided compelling evidence that SAA can act as a chemoattractant for such immune cells as monocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, mast cells, and T lymphocytes (24Badolato R. Wang J.M. Murphy W.J. Lloyd A.R. Michiel D.F. Bausserman L.L. Kelvin D.J. Oppenheim J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 25Xu L. Badolato R. Murphy W.J.

Commun. 1999; 254: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that SAA significantly stimulates the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-8 and IL-1β by cultured human neutrophils, as well as the release of tumor necrosis factor-α from lymphocytes (27Furlaneto C.J. Campa A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and of IL-1β from THP-1 monocytic cells (3Patel H. Fellowes R. Coade S. Woo P. Scand. J. Immunol. 1998; 48: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The importance of SAA in various physiological and pathological processes has raised a considerable interest in the identity of the one or more cell surface receptors that bind, internalize, and mediate SAA-induced pro-inflammatory effects. SAA has been recently demonstrated to be a chemoattractant ligand for the human N-formyl peptide receptor like-1, a transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor expressed on phagocytes (28Su S.B. Gong W. Gao J.L. Shen W. Murphy P.M. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Additionally, the cytokine-like activity of SAA has been reported to be directly mediated by N-formyl peptide receptor like-1/LXA4R, the receptor recognized as a mediator of the anti-inflammatory effects of lipoxin (1Kumon Y. Hosokawa T. Suehiro T. Ikeda Y. Sipe J.D. Hashimoto K. Amyloid. 2002; 9: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 29He R. Sang H. Ye R.D. Blood. 2003; 101: 1572-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). CLA-1 and rodent scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), are HDL receptors, highly expressed in liver, adrenal gland, ovary (30Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), and atherosclerotic lesions of apoE-deficient mice (31Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. de la Llera Moya M. Philips M.C.

In addition, CLA-1 and SR-BI are highly expressed on monocytes/macrophages (32Pearson A.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), cells known to be the primary sites of SAA uptake. Like CD36, SR-BI/CLA-1 has been shown to be a multifunctional receptor able to bind a broad variety of ligands, including native, oxidized, and acetylated low density lipoprotein (33Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), native very low density lipoprotein (34Krieger M. Annu. Rev.

The presence of amphipathic helices is a common feature of exchangeable apolipoproteins, known to be the primary ligands for SR-BI. Utilizing this knowledge, our group and others (38Williams D.L. de La Llera-Moya M. Thuahnai S.T. Lund-Katz S. Connelly M.A. Azhar S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18897-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) have provided evidence that synthetic amphipathic peptides, possessing one or more class A amphipathic helices in their structure, are potent CLA-1 ligands and effective competitors for apoA-I and HDL binding to SR-BI/CLA-1 (39Bocharov A.V. Baranova I.N. Vishnyakova T.G. Remaley A.T. Csako G. Thomas F. Patterson A.P. Eggerman T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36072-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because SAA is known to be an amphipathic protein, having two amphipathic α-helical regions corresponding to the 1–18 N-terminal and 72–86 C-terminal sequences (14Uhlar C.M. Whitehead A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), we evaluated whether CLA-1 is a potential SAA receptor involved in binding, internalization, and pro-inflammatory signaling. Only recently, a new function for SR-BI has emerged: the activation of cell signaling pathways upon ligand binding (40Yuhanna I.S. Zhu Y. Cox B.E. Hahner L.D. Osborne-Lawrence S. Lu P. Marcel Y.L.

The concept of CLA-1 being involved in the signal transduction process results from a recently observed interaction between CLA-1 and the cytoplasmic PDZK1 adaptor protein (43Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aok I.J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This adaptor protein is known to play a crucial role in regulating various biological processes, including signal transduction, adhesion, membrane trafficking, and cellular transport (44Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). The initial report indicated that one of the four domains of PDZK1 is associated with the SR-BI cytoplasmic C terminus (43Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aok I.J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Additionally, the ability of HDL to stimulate the endothelial nitric-oxide synthase activity in an SR-BI-dependent manner has been demonstrated by the studies of Yuhanna et al. (40Yuhanna I.S. Zhu Y. Cox B.E. Hahner L.D. Osborne-Lawrence S. Lu P. Marcel Y.L. Anderson R.G. Mendelsohn M.E. Hobbs H.H. Shaul P.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) and Li et al. (41Li X.A. Titlow W.B. Jackson B.A. Giltiay N. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Uittenbogaard A. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11058-11063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the report of Grewal et al. (42Grewal T. de Diego I. Kirchhoff M.F. Tebar F. Heeren J. Rinninger F. Enrich C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16478-16481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) provided additional evidence for SR-BI signaling by describing SR-BI as a primary candidate for HDL-initiated signaling through activating Ras in a protein kinase C-independent manner. These multiple observations have led us to investigate the role of CLA-1 as a potential SAA-signaling receptor, contributing to the SAA-induced pro-inflammatory response. In this study, using the CLA-1-overexpressing HeLa cell model and human monocyte cell line, we demonstrate that lipid-poor SAA directly binds to CLA-1 and that CLA-1 ligands efficiently compete with SAA for CLA-1 binding. Furthermore, SAA is found to activate p44/p42 and p38 kinases, two members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily in both HeLa and THP-1 cells in a CLA-1-dependent manner. Reagents—All media, sera, and antibiotics were from Invitrogen. The MAPK inhibitors PD98059 and SB203580 were purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA), human HDL was obtained from Calbiochem, and recombinant synthetic human apoSAA was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Lipid content of the recombinant apoSAA was analyzed by the Phospholipids B enzymatic method (Wako, Richmond, VA) and an enzymatic cholesterol method (Roche Applied Science) on a Cobas Fara II analyzer (Roche Applied Science). According to these assays, the SAA preparation contained small amounts of phospholipids (5 ng/μg) and cholesterol (<2 ng/μg) and was considered as a lipid-poor form of SAA throughout this study. The endotoxin level in both SAA and HDL preparations were <0.1 ng/μg (1 endotoxin unit/μg). The synthetic amphipathic peptides were synthesized by a solid-phase procedure (45Merrifield R.B. JAMA. 1969; 210: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 46Fairwell T. Hospattankar A.V. Brewer Jr., H.B. Khan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thomas F. Patterson A.P. Eggerman T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36072-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cell Cultures—Human HeLa (Tet-off) cells (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and CLA-1-overexpressing HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml G418 at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The CLA-1-overexpressing HeLa cell (4C2 clone) was characterized in our previous report (37Vishnyakova T.G. Bocharov A.V. Baranova I.N. Chen Z. Remaley A.T. Csako G. Eggerman T.L. Patterson A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22771-22780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To further confirm the results obtained using the 4C2 clone, additional CLA-1-overexpressing HeLa cell clones were analyzed for Alexa 488-HDL binding and CLA-1 expression by Western blotting. As an additional model, HEK 293 cells with low endogenous CLA-1 levels were stably transfected with CLA-1 pIRES-hrGFP-2a plasmid (Stratagene) followed by selecting cells with highest green fluorescent protein expression. Human monocytic THP-1 cells (TIB-202 from ATTC) were maintained in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Differentiated human monocytes were prepared as previously reported (47Buechler C. Ritter M. Quoc C.D. Agildere A. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Alexa 488-labeled Ligand Uptake and Competition Experiments— HDL and SAA were conjugated with Alexa Fluor® 488, using a protein labeling kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) following the vendor's instructions. The Alexa-labeled preparations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, using 10–20% Tricine pre-cast gels (Invitrogen). Gels were scanned using a Fluorocsan (model A, Hitachi). Alexa-labeled HDL apolipoproteins, and SAA were detected in the appropriate position with molecular masses of 28, 18, and 12 kDa for apoA-I, apoA-II, and SAA, respectively (data not shown). All incubations were performed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HeLa cells) or RPMI 1640 (THP-1 cells), containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C. Uptake experiments with HeLa cells were performed by using Alexa 488-SAA at concentrations between 1.25 and 10 μg/ml. After 2 h of SAA incubation, the cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and detached by a 30-min incubation in EDTA-containing Cell stripper (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA). Cells were resuspended and added to an equal volume of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. A competition assay was performed, using 5 μg/ml fluorescence-labeled SAA and unlabeled ligands ranging in concentration from 5 to 100 μg/ml. Following a 2-h incubation, HeLa cells were treated as described above, while the samples of THP-1 cell suspensions were transferred to centrifuge tubes and pelleted by a brief centrifugation (5000 rpm, 5 min at 4 °C). After washing with ice-cold PBS, the cells were centrifuged one more time, and the resulting pellets were again resuspended in PBS and mixed with an equal volume of 4% paraformaldehyde. Cell-associated fluorescence was analyzed by a flow cytometry using a FACScan (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, San Carlos, CA). Detection of Activated ERK1/2 and p38 by Western Blot Analyses— Mock (Tet-off) and CLA-1-overexpressing HeLa cells were grown in 6-well culture plates to confluence. Before the MAPK activation assay, the cells were incubated overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were stimulated for the indicated periods of time with SAA (25 μg/ml), HDL (50 μg/ml), or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (25 ng/ml) at 37 °C. After stimulation, the culture medium was immediately aspirated; the cells were placed on ice and washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Afterward, the cells were scrapped into 100 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm 2β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture set III (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA)). After 10-min incubation on ice, the samples were sonicated for 5–6 s and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell extracts were collected and mixed with the 2× SDS sample buffer. The samples were separated on SDS-PAGE in 10% Tris-glycine pre-cast gels (Invitrogen) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk and further incubated either with the primary anti-phospho-p44/42 or anti-phospho-p38 MAPK antibodies or with the corresponding antibodies that recognize both active and inactive forms of each subfamily of kinases (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) overnight at 4 °C. Immunoreactive bands were detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences). Alternatively, the immunoreactive bands were detected using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and Western Blue Stabilized Substrate for Alkaline Phosphatase (Promega, Madison, MI). For measurement of MAPK activation, THP-1 cells were incubated overnight in serum-free RPMI with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and further incubated in the same fresh medium for the next 4 h. Before the experiment, the cells were placed into 12-well culture plates (2 × 106 cells per well) and treated with the corresponding stimuli for the indicated duration of time. The cell suspensions were then collected and centrifuged (12,000 rpm, 5 min at 4 °C). The cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS, and subsequently pelleted by a brief centrifugation. The resulting cell pellets were resuspended in the lysis buffer and analyzed according to the procedure described above for HeLa cells. Other Procedures—IL-8 secretion was analyzed in culture media after a 24-h incubation utilizing commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (BioSource International, Camarillo, CA). Cross-linking and colocalization experiments were conducted as reported previously (39Bocharov A.V. Baranova I.N. Vishnyakova T.G. Remaley A.T. Csako G. Thomas F. Patterson A.P. Eggerman T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36072-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, fluorescently labeled ligands (Alexa 488-HDL or Alexa 488-SAA) were added in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mg/ml lipid-free bovine serum albumin, and the cells were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and incubated with 250 μm disuccinimidyl suberate in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After washing and a 2% Triton X-100 extraction, the complexes were precipitated using rabbit anti-CLA-1 (raised against the C-terminal 15-AA peptide) or non-immune rabbit serum. Tris-glycine (12%)/SDS-PAGE, gels were utilized for protein separation, and Alexa 488 signal was detected using a Typhoon 9200 imager (Amersham Biosciences). For colocalization experiments, CLA-1-overexpressing and mock transfected HeLa cells were incubated with 2.5 μg/ml Alexa 488-SAA for 1 h at 37 °C followed by fixation using 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized by incubating with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and further incubated with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1% goat serum in PBS to prevent nonspecific antibody absorption. CLA-1 was detected utilizing rabbit anti-CLA-1 antiserum as a first antibody. Alexa 488/568-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG were used as a second antibody (39Bocharov A.V. Baranova I.N. Vishnyakova T.G.

Fluorescence was viewed with a Zeiss 510 laser scanning confocal microscope, using a krypton-argon-Omnichrome laser with excitation wavelengths of 488 and 568 nm for Alexa-488 and Alexa-568 labels, respectively.

We found that pharmacological blockade of RAGE impaired peripheral nerve regeneration in mice subjected to RAGE blockade and acute crush of the sciatic nerve. As our studies revealed that RAGE was expressed in axons and in infiltrating mononuclear phagocytes upon injury, we tested the role of RAGE in these distinct cell types on nerve regeneration. Transgenic mice expressing signal transduction-deficient RAGE in mononuclear phagocytes or peripheral neurons were generated and subjected to unilateral crush injury to the sciatic nerve. Transgenic mice displayed decreased functional and morphological recovery compared with littermate controls, as assessed by motor and sensory conduction velocities; and myelinated fiber density. In double transgenic mice expressing signal transduction deficient RAGE in both mononuclear phagocytes and peripheral neurons, regeneration was even further impaired, suggesting the critical interplay between RAGE-modulated inflammation and neurite outgrowth in nerve repair. These findings suggest that RAGE signaling in inflammatory cells and peripheral neurons plays an important role in plasticity of the peripheral nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2155130672,"Vitamin E supplementation constitutes a promising strategy in the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we show that a phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) is widely expressed in the brain where it appears to function as a transfer factor for alpha-tocopherol, the main isomer of vitamin E. PLTP deficiency results in significant depletion of brain alpha-tocopherol in both homozygous (-30.1%, P<0.0002) and heterozygous (-18.0%, P<0.05) PLTP knocked-out mice. Alpha-tocopherol depletion in PLTP-deficient homozygotes is associated with the elevation of lipofuscin (+25% and +450% increases in cortex and substantia nigra, respectively), cholesterol oxides (+54.5%, P<0.05), and cellular peroxides (+32.3%, P<0.01) in the brain. Complete PLTP deficiency in homozygotes is accompanied by increased anxiety as shown by fewer entries (8.3% vs. 44.4% in controls, P<0.01) and less time spent (1.7% vs. 41.3% in controls, P<0.05) in the open arms of an elevated plus-maze, in the absence of locomotor deterioration. Thus, the vitamin E transfer activity of PLTP appears to be a key process in preventing oxidative damage in the brain, and PLTP-deficient mice could be a new model of the contribution of oxidative brain injury in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases."

Administration of soluble RAGE, the extracellular ligand binding domain of RAGE, or blocking F(ab')2 fragments of antibodies raised to either RAGE or its ligands, S100/calgranulins or amphoterin, reduced functional recovery as assessed by motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities and sciatic functional index and reduced regeneration, as assessed by myelinated fiber density after acute crush of the sciatic nerve. In parallel, in mice subjected to RAGE blockade, decreased numbers of mononuclear phagocytes infiltrated the distal nerve segments after crush. These findings provide the first evidence of an innate function of the ligand/RAGE axis and suggest that RAGE plays an important role in regeneration of the peripheral nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2154604887,"Dysfunction and death of spinal cord neurons are critical determinants of neurological deficits in various pathological conditions, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and spinal cord injury. Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal/axonal damage remain undefined. Our previous studies raised the possibility that a decrease in the levels of plasma membrane calcium ATPase isoform 2 (PMCA2), a major pump extruding calcium from neurons, promotes neuronal pathology in the spinal cord during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, and after spinal cord trauma. However, the causal relationship between alterations in PMCA2 levels and neuronal injury was not well established. We now report that inhibition of PMCA activity in purified spinal cord neuronal cultures delays calcium clearance, increases the number of nonphosphorylated neurofilament H (SMI-32) immunoreactive cells, and induces swelling and beading of SMI-32-positive neurites. These changes are followed by activation of caspase-3 and neuronal loss. Importantly, the number of spinal cord motor neurons is significantly decreased in PMCA2-deficient mice and the deafwaddler(2J), a mouse with a functionally null mutation in the PMCA2 gene. Our findings suggest that a reduction in PMCA2 level or activity leading to delays in calcium clearance may cause neuronal damage and loss in the spinal cord."

Here we report far-infrared and molecular line observations that demonstrate that most of the detected submillimetre emission originates from interstellar dust in a molecular cloud complex located in the line of sight between the Earth and Cas A, and is therefore not associated with the remnant. The argument that type II supernovae produce copious amounts of dust is not supported by the case of Cas A, which previously appeared to provide the best evidence for this possibility."
https://openalex.org/W2029552800,"The spread of infectious diseases and the increase in antibiotic resistance represent a life-threatening global development that calls for new approaches to control microorganisms. Of all potential targets, the essential and unique pathway of bacterial cell wall synthesis, targeted by the first known antibiotic penicillin, remains a perfect candidate for the development of new antibiotics. Here we show that the lantibiotic nisin exercises its antibacterial action by targeting peptidoglycan intermediates' extracellular pyrophosphate, unique to bacterial cell wall precursors. We show that nisin sequesters cell wall precursors found in the outer leaflet of bacterial plasma membranes, Lipid II and undecaprenyl pyrophosphate, into stable complexes. We propose a model of antibacterial action for nisin in which the terminal amino group of Ile1 targets the pyrophosphate groups of the bacterial cell wall precursors, where it docks via a hydrogen bond. The pyrophosphate moiety, a highly conserved chemical group different from the L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala docking motif for vancomycin, has no biochemical analogs with comparable properties and is unlikely to be susceptible to bacterial adaptations akin to those responsible for resistance to penicillins and vancomycin."
https://openalex.org/W1974934658,"Stimulation of FcϵRI, the high affinity IgE receptor of mast cells results in the rapid binding of the Syk tyrosine kinase to cytoplasmic domains of FcϵRI and to its subsequent activation. Syk plays an essential role in signal transduction from FcϵRI as shown by Syk-deficient mast cells, which are defective in receptor-induced degranulation, cytokine synthesis, and intracellular pathways. However the mechanism by which Syk activates these pathways remains unclear. Activation of Syk is associated with its phosphorylation on several tyrosine residues, including the linker tyrosines Tyr317, Tyr342, and Tyr346. These residues have been proposed to play important roles in the transduction of signals by binding to other signaling proteins. To test these hypotheses in primary murine mast cells, we used retroviral infection of Syk-deficient mast cells to generate cells expressing Syk proteins bearing mutations in the linker tyrosines. We show that Tyr342 and Tyr346 contribute positively to the function of Syk and have both overlapping as well as distinct functions. Mutations in either Tyr342 or Tyr346 alone had no effect on FcϵRI-induced degranulation or calcium flux, whereas mutation of both residues caused a significant reduction in both pathways. In contrast, phosphorylation of PLCγ1, PLCγ2, and Vav1 was strongly decreased by a mutation in Tyr342 alone, whereas phosphorylation of ERK and Akt was more dependent on Tyr346. Finally we show that Tyr317 functions as a negative regulatory site and that its mutation can partially compensate for the loss of both Tyr342 and Tyr346.

The activation of mast cells by complexes of antigen and immunoglobulin E (IgE) 1The abbreviations used are: IgE, immunoglobulin E; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; SH2, Src homology 2; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PLC, phospholipase C; MCM, mast cell medium; SCF, stem cell factor; DNP, dintrophenyl; HSA, human serum albumin; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; TCR, T cell receptor; cdb3, cytoplasmic domain of erythrocyte band 3; pTyr or pY, phosphotyrosine; Ab, antibody; HRP, horseradish peroxidase. is a key component of the allergic response. Binding of IgE-antigen to FcϵRI, the high affinity IgE receptor of mast cells activates biochemical signaling pathways resulting in the release of three classes of allergic mediators (1Nadler M.J. Matthews S.A. Turner H. Kinet J.P. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 76: 325-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, the cells degranulate, releasing allergic mediators such as serotonin and histamine from preformed granules. Second, they synthesize leukotrienes and prostaglandins, and finally, they induce expression and secretion of cytokines. Signaling from FcϵRI is initiated by IgE-antigen-induced aggregation, resulting in the activation of the associated Src family kinases Lyn and Fyn, which phosphorylate tandem tyrosines of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) located in the cytoplasmic domains of the β- and γ-subunits of FcϵRI (2Siraganian R.P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). These ITAM phosphotyrosines in turn form binding sites for the tandem SH2 domains of the Syk tyrosine kinase. Binding of Syk to the phosphorylated ITAMs causes a conformational change in the enzyme resulting in its activation, autophosphorylation, and Lyn-dependent phosphorylation (3Shiue L. Zoller M.J. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10498-10502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 4Kimura T. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Siraganian R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1471-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Syk is essential for signal transduction from FcϵRI, as we demonstrated using Syk-deficient primary murine mast cells. In the absence of Syk, mast cells failed to degranulate, synthesize leukotrienes, and secrete cytokines following FcϵRI stimulation (5Costello P.S. Turner M. Walters A.E. Cunningham C.N. Bauer P.H. Downward J. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2595-2605PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained by others using a Syk-deficient variant of the rat basophilic leukemic cell line RBL-2H3 (6Zhang J. Berenstein E.H. Evans R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Analysis of FcϵRI signaling pathways in Syk-deficient mast cells showed that, as expected, Syk was not required for the activation of Lyn, or for the phosphorylation of FcϵRI-β and -γ (5Costello P.S. Turner M. Walters A.E. Cunningham C.N. Bauer P.H. Downward J. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2595-2605PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the FcϵRI-induced rise in intracellular Ca2+, and activation of the ERK and JNK MAP kinase pathways was completely abrogated in the absence of Syk. Furthermore, phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) and of the Vav1 exchange factor was also Syk-dependent. A number of tyrosine residues in Syk have been shown to undergo phosphorylation following stimulation of FcϵRI or other immune receptors (7Turner M. Schweighoffer E. Colucci F. Di Santo J.P. Tybulewicz V.L. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 148-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). There has been much interest in determining the significance of these modifications, in particular of tyrosines in the kinase domain and in the linker domain, which lies between the SH2 domains and the kinase domain. Two tyrosine residues in the activation loop of the kinase domain of Syk (Tyr519 and Tyr520) have been shown to be essential for FcϵRI signaling in RBL-2H3 cells (8Zhang J. Kimura T. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4366-4374PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of both tyrosines does not affect the kinase activity of Syk, but blocks FcϵRI-induced degranulation, ERK activation, and PLCγ1 phosphorylation. Three conserved tyrosine residues in the linker domain, Tyr317, Tyr342, and Tyr346, lie within consensus sequences for recognition by SH2 domains, suggesting that they may play important roles in transducing signals. Phosphorylation of Tyr317 creates a binding site for c-Cbl, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, whose binding has been proposed to cause the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Syk (9Paolini R. Molfetta R. Beitz L.O. Zhang J. Scharenberg A.M. Piccoli M. Frati L. Siraganian R. Santoni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36940-36947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus Tyr317 was proposed to function as a negative regulatory site on Syk. In agreement with this, expression of the SykY317F mutant protein in Syk-deficient RBL-2H3 cells resulted in a large increase in FcϵRI-induced degranulation, and phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 (10Sada K. Zhang J. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, Tyr342 and Tyr346 have been proposed to function as positive regulatory sites. In COS cells, Vav1 has been reported to bind to phosphorylated Tyr342 (pY342) through its SH2 domain, and this binding may be enhanced by pY346 (11Deckert M. Tartare Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Furthermore, also in COS cells, mutation of Tyr342 and Tyr346 abolished both the binding of PLCγ1 to Syk and the Syk-induced phosphorylation of PLCγ1 (12Law C.L. Chandran K.A. Sidorenko S.P. Clark E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus it has been proposed that pY342 and pY346 may function as binding sites to recruit substrates for Syk, such as Vav1, PLCγ1, and potentially other signaling proteins. This idea has been tested in RBL-2H3 cells, where expression of Syk with a Y342F mutation resulted in decreased FcϵRI-induced degranulation, calcium flux, and phosphorylation PLCγ2, LAT, and SLP-76 but, surprisingly, normal phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and Vav1 (13Zhang J. Berenstein E. Siraganian R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8144-8154Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast, a Y346F mutation had little effect. In this study we examine the role of Tyr342 and Tyr346 in transducing FcϵRI signals in primary murine mast cells by reconstituting Syk-deficient cells with Syk genes mutated at Tyr342, Tyr346, or both. We show that while mutation of both residues is required to show significant reductions in FcϵRI-induced degranulation and calcium flux, single mutations in either Tyr342 or Tyr346 cause reductions in FcϵRI-induced phosphorylation of PLCγ1, PLCγ2, LAT, SLP-76, Vav1, ERK, and Akt. Interestingly, the effects of the two mutations are distinct with different pathways showing different dependence on the two tyrosines. Mast Cell Culture—Mice bearing a gene disruption of the Syk gene on a 129S8 background have been described before (129S8-Syktm1Tyb/+, Syk+/–) (14Turner M. Mee P.J. Costello P.S. Williams O. Price A.A. Duddy L.P. Furlong M.T. Geahlen R.L. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Syk+/– mice were intercrossed, and fetal liver cells from resulting 16.5-day wild-type or Syk–/– embryos were cultured at 2 × 105 cells/ml in mast cell medium (MCM; RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine (2 mm), non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen, Life Technologies), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), 2-mercaptoethanol (50 μm), penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% conditioned medium from WEHI-3B cells as a source of IL-3). After 7 days of culture, the adherent cells were scraped off, and together with the suspension cells were reseeded at 2 × 105 cells/ml in fresh MCM. This was repeated every week. After 4 weeks of culture, only suspension cells were propagated. These were confirmed as being >95% mast cells by staining for FcϵRI (5Costello P.S. Turner M. Walters A.E. Cunningham C.N. Bauer P.H. Downward J. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2595-2605PubMed Google Scholar). Retroviral Vectors—pcDNA3 plasmids containing wild-type murine Syk cDNA and SykY342F, SykY346F, and SykY317F/Y342F/Y346F have been described before (15Hong J.J. Yankee T.M. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31703-31714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The SykY342F/Y346F mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of SykY346F using the following primers: 5′-GGACACAGAGGTGTTCGAGAGCCCTTTTGC-3′, and 5′-GCAAAAGGGCTCTCGAACACCTCTGTGTCC-3′, and the site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, cat. no. 200518). Wild-type and mutant Syk cDNAs were excised from pcDNA3 as a 2.5-kb BamHI/EheI fragment and cloned between the BamHI and NotI sites of the pMXpuro retroviral vector (T. Kawakami, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology) (16Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 324-329PubMed Google Scholar). All mutants were verified by sequencing. Retroviral Transduction of Cells—pMXpuro retroviral vectors were transfected into the BOSC23 packaging cell line (17Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). For infection of NIH-3T3 cells, medium containing the retrovirus was harvested from the BOSC23 cells 48 h after transfection, filtered (0.45 μm), and 2 ml of this retroviral supernatant containing polybrene (10 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) were placed onto 10-cm plates of 70% confluent NIH-3T3 cells from which medium had been removed. The cells were cultured for 4 h at 37 °C, then fresh medium was added (10 ml/plate). After a further 48 h of culture, the NIH-3T3 cells were selected with puromycin (2 μg/ml). For infection of mast cells, the transfected BOSC23 cells (5 × 106 cells) were mitotically inactivated (3000 rad of γ-irradiation from a 137Cs source), and then co-cultured for 24 h in MCM, stem cell factor (SCF, 100 ng/ml, R&D Systems), and polybrene (10 μg/ml) with 4-week-old mast cell cultures (107 cells) that had been grown for the previous 2 weeks in MCM with SCF. Following exposure to retrovirus, the mast cells were harvested away from the adherent BOSC23 cells and put into fresh MCM plus SCF for 48 h, after which time they were selected by culturing in MCM, SCF, and puromycin (2 μg/ml) for at least a week. Cells used for experiments were taken out of puromycin selection at least 2 weeks prior to the experiment. Degranulation—To measure degranulation by release of serotonin, mast cells were preloaded overnight with anti-DNP-IgE (5 μg/ml, SPE-7, Sigma) and with 5-hydroxy[G-3H]tryptamine (serotonin) (66 nm, 15.1 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). Washed cells were challenged with DNP-HSA (Sigma) diluted in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) for 30 min. Percentage degranulation was defined as the fraction of [3H]serotonin released into the supernatant. Typical maximal degranulation response of mast cells expressing wild-type Syk (usually observed at 10 ng/ml DNP-HSA) was 50–70%. Within each experiment each stimulation was carried out in duplicate or triplicate, and the mean degranulation calculated. To combine data from experiments carried out on different days, degranulation was normalized to the maximum response observed for cells expressing wild-type Syk, which was set at 100%. Intracellular Calcium Flux—Mast cells were preloaded with anti-DNP-IgE (5 μg/ml) for 1 h in RPMI 1640, then washed into RPMI 1640 containing Indo-1-AM (1 mm) and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min in the dark. Analysis was undertaken on a FACSVantage flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Indo-1 emission was detected using 405/40 nm (violet) and 495/20 nm (blue) bandpass filters. To determine relative calcium concentration, cells were warmed to 37 °C, analyzed for 1 min to establish baseline calcium levels and stimulated by the addition of DNP-HSA (10 ng/ml). Acquisition was continued for a further 5 min. Relative intracellular calcium concentration was calculated from a ratio of the violet/blue emissions. Biochemical Analysis of Signaling Pathways—Cells were preloaded overnight with anti-DNP-IgE. To make total cell lysates, cells were challenged at 106 cells/ml with 10 ng/ml DNP-HSA in RPMI, and lysates prepared by directly boiling cells in reducing sample buffer. For immunoprecipitations, cells were challenged in RPMI at 107 cells/ml with DNP-HSA (10 ng/ml) and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm disodium pyrophosphate, pH 7.5, 2% n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1:50 (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (P8340; Sigma-Aldrich)). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. Immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were carried out by standard procedures. The following antibodies were used for immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting: anti-PLCγ1 rabbit polyclonal Ab (sc-81, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-PLCγ2 rabbit polyclonal Ab (sc-407; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-LAT rabbit polyclonal Ab M41 (M. Turner, Babraham Institute), anti-SLP-76 sheep polyclonal Ab (G. Koretzky, University of Pennsylvania), anti-Vav1 rabbit polyclonal Ab (06-285, Upstate Biotechnology). The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: anti-phosphotyrosine mAb RC20 conjugated directly to horseradish peroxidase (HRP, BD Transduction Labs), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (E-4) mAb (sc-7383, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-ERK2 rabbit polyclonal Ab (C. Marshall, Institute for Cancer Research), anti-Syk rabbit polyclonal Ab (14Turner M. Mee P.J. Costello P.S. Williams O. Price A.A. Duddy L.P. Furlong M.T. Geahlen R.L. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), anti-Lyn rabbit polyclonal Ab (5Costello P.S. Turner M. Walters A.E. Cunningham C.N. Bauer P.H. Downward J. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2595-2605PubMed Google Scholar), anti-Akt and anti-phosphoserine 473-Akt (Cell Signaling Technology). Antibody binding was revealed with goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for mouse monoclonal antibodies, with protein A-HRP (Amersham Biosciences) for rabbit polyclonal antibodies, and with donkey anti-sheep IgG-HRP (Serotec) for sheep polyclonal antibody. For densitometric analysis, the blots were scanned, bands of interest were quantitated and in-lane background was subtracted. To determine specific phosphorylation, the signal from phosphorylated bands was divided by the signal from the appropriate loading control, and all values were normalized to the maximum response (set to 100%). In Vitro Syk Kinase Assay—2 × 107 NIH-3T3 cells retrovirally transduced with the different forms of Syk were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.01% SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm benzamidine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 mm TLCK (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 mm TPCK (Sigma-Aldrich), protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich)). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. Lysates were precleared with protein A-agarose beads (sc-2001, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 30 min at 4 °C. Syk was immunoprecipitated from the lysates using an anti-Syk antibody (sc-1077, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C, and then protein A-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice with kinase buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and then resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 5μm ATP, 5μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 5 μg of cdb3 (cytoplasmic domain of erythrocyte band 3 protein expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by ion exchange chromatography and ammonium sulfate precipitation), and incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. Control experiments showed that the kinase reaction was still linear at this time point (not shown). An equal quantity of 2× sample buffer was added to the samples, which were denatured at 100 °C for 5 min before analysis by SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and immunoblotting. Expression of Syk with Mutations in Linker Region Tyrosines in Syk–/– Mast Cells—To generate primary mast cells expressing Syk with mutations in linker region tyrosines, we infected fetal liver-derived Syk–/– mast cell cultures with the pMXpuro retroviral vector. The pMXpuro vector expresses a puromycin resistance gene from an internal SV40 promoter as well as the gene of interest from the 5′-long terminal repeat (16Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 324-329PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were infected with the empty pMXpuro vector (E), or pMXpuro expressing wild-type Syk (WT), SykY342F (Y342F), SykY346F (Y346F), SykY342F/Y3546F (Y342F/Y3546F), and SykY317F/Y342F/Y3546F (3F), and subsequently selected with puromycin. Immunoblot analysis showed that wild-type Syk and the Syk mutants were all expressed at similar levels in the Syk–/– mast cells, but in all cases were overexpressed relative to the levels of endogenous Syk in Syk+/+ mast cells (Fig. 1A). Dilution analysis showed that this overexpression was about 10-fold (not shown). To ascertain whether the mutations affected the activity of the Syk tyrosine kinase, we immunoprecipitated Syk from infected cells and performed an in vitro kinase assay using the cytoplasmic domain of erythrocyte band 3 protein as a substrate. These studies showed equivalent activity between wild-type and mutant forms of Syk, supporting the view that mutation of the linker tyrosines has not perturbed the intrinsic kinase activity of the enzyme. Tyr342 and Tyr346 Are Required for Efficient FcϵRI-induced Degranulation—We have previously shown that Syk is absolutely required for FcϵRI-induced degranulation in primary mast cells (5Costello P.S. Turner M. Walters A.E. Cunningham C.N. Bauer P.H. Downward J. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2595-2605PubMed Google Scholar). Using mast cells expressing the different mutant Syk proteins, we evaluated the role of the linker tyrosines in this acute allergic response, by preloading the cells with anti-DNP IgE, and then cross-linking the FcϵRI receptor with different doses of DNP-HSA. We found that while mutation of either Tyr342 or Tyr346 had no significant effect, the Y342F/Y346F double mutant showed a reduced efficiency of degranulation at suboptimal and supraoptimal doses DNP-HSA (Fig. 2). Nonetheless, it is clear that while Tyr342 and Tyr346 play a role in transducing FcϵRI signals leading to degranulation, they are not essential, since at the optimal dose of DNP-HSA, degranulation in Y342F/Y346-expressing cells was normal.Fig. 1Expression of Syk with mutations in linker region tyrosines. A, immunoblot of cell lysates from Syk+/+ mast cells or Syk–/– mast cells infected with an empty retroviral vector (E), or a vector expressing wild-type Syk (WT), SykY342F (Y342F), SykY346F (Y346F), SykY342F/Y346F (Y342F/Y346F), or SykY317F/Y342F/Y346F (3F). Blot was immunoblotted (IB) with antiserum specific for Syk, then stripped and reprobed with antiserum against Lyn as a loading control. Note that there are two isoforms of Lyn. B, Syk was immunoprecipitated (IP) from NIH-3T3 cells infected with retroviral vectors described in A, and used in an in vitro kinase (IVK) reaction with [γ-32P]ATP to phosphorylate cdb3. An autoradiograph of the immunoblot shows incorporation of 32P into cdb3 as a measure of Syk kinase activity (IVK). The blot was probed with antiserum specific for Syk as a loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 2Less efficient FcϵRI-induced degranulation in mast cells expressing SykY342F/Y346F.

When phosphorylated, this residue has been postulated to bind Cbl, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which acts as a negative regulator of immune receptor signaling by causing the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Syk (9Paolini R. Molfetta R. Beitz L.O. Zhang J. Scharenberg A.M. Piccoli M. Frati L. Siraganian R. Santoni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36940-36947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10Sada K. Zhang J. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Expression of SykY317F in RBL-2H3 basophilic cells leads to increased FcϵRI-induced degranulation and phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 (10Sada K. Zhang J. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The effect of this mutation is presumably to cause less ubiquitination and degradation of Syk. We wondered whether the Y317F mutation could compensate for the signaling defects in mast cells expressing Syk with mutations in Tyr342 and Tyr346. To evaluate this, we generated mast cell cultures expressing SykY317F/Y342F/Y346F (3F), and compared their responses to cells expressing the double mutant Y342F/Y346F. We found that the 3F mutant restored normal FcϵRI-induced degranulation (Fig. 2), consistent with Tyr317 playing a negative regulatory role. Mutation of Tyr342 and Tyr346 Results in Delayed FcϵRI-induced Calcium Flux—A rapid rise in intracellular calcium is a hallmark of FcϵRI signaling and is required for degranulation (18Mohr F.C.

Once again we had shown earlier that Syk is absolutely required for the FcϵRI-induced calcium flux in primary mast cells (5Costello P.S. Turner M. Walters A.E. Cunningham C.N. Bauer P.H. Downward J. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2595-2605PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of FcϵRI-induced calcium flux in mutant mast cells showed that while mutations in either Tyr342 or Tyr346 alone had no effect, the Y342F/Y346F double mutant showed a delayed calcium response (Fig. 3). However, despite the delay, cells expressing SykY342F/Y346F still achieved a normal maximum of intracellular calcium, showing that these linker tyrosines are not absolutely required for this response. In cells expressing the 3F Syk mutant, FcϵRI-induced calcium flux was the same as that in cells expressing wild-type Syk, showing that, as with degranulation, the Y317F mutation reversed the effects of the Y342F/Y346F double mutant. Mutation of Tyr342 and Tyr346 Results in Defective FcϵRI-induced Phosphorylation of PLCγ1, PLCγ2, LAT, SLP-76, and Vav1—In mast cells, the FcϵRI-induced intracellular calcium flux is induced by the second messenger inositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, which in turn is generated following the hydrolysis of phosphatidyl-4,5-bisphosphate by PLCγ1 and PLCγ2. We had previously shown that Syk was absolutely required for the FcϵRI-induced phosphorylation of PLCγ1, a modification that correlates with its activation (5Costello P.S. Turner M. Walters A.E. Cunningham C.N. Bauer P.H. Downward J. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2595-2605PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we found that the phosphorylation of the related PLCγ2 isoform was also strictly Syk-dependent (Fig. 4, A and B). Examination of cells expressing the mutant Syk proteins showed that the Y342F mutation alone was sufficient to substantially reduce FcϵRI-induced phosphorylation of both PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, the effect of the Y346F mutation was less pronounced. In cells expressing the Y342F/Y346F double mutant, the FcϵRI-induced phosphorylation of both PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 was largely abrogated, similar to the Y342F single mutation. Expression of the 3F Syk mutant restored some FcϵRI-induced phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and PLCγ2, once again consistent with a negative signaling role for Tyr317. Studies of primary mast cells deficient in the LAT or SLP-76 adapter proteins have shown that both proteins are required for FcϵRI-induced calcium flux and phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 (19Saitoh S.

Furthermore, Jurkat T cells deficient in the Syk family kinase ZAP-70 show no T cell receptor (TCR)-induced phosphorylation of either LAT or SLP-76 (21Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L.

Taken together, these studies suggest that in mast cells, Syk may transduce FcϵRI signals to the phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 in part by phosphorylating LAT and SLP-76. To examine this possibility, and to determine if the effect of the Tyr342 and Tyr346 mutations on PLCγ phosphorylation may be caused by reduced phosphorylation of the adapter proteins, we examined this pathway in mast cells deficient in Syk, or expressing the mutant proteins. We found that FcϵRI-i"

H/R can induce Bid and Bax mitochondrial translocation and cytochrome c release. Using mouse lung endothelial cells (MLEC), we examined the role of Bcl-X(L), an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-related protein, in H/R-induced cell death. The expression of Bcl-X(L) protected MLEC against H/R-induced cell death by blocking Bax and Bid translocation and inhibiting mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Bcl-X(L) expression inhibited caspase-8 cleavage and death-inducing signal complex (DISC) formation in plasma membrane. By isolating mitochondrial, nuclear, and Golgi fractions, we found that H/R induced DISC formation in these organelles. Bcl-X(L) expression inhibited DISC formation in the nuclear and Golgi fractions relative to LacZ-infected controls. In contrast, DISC formation was elevated in the mitochondrial fraction of Bcl-X(L)-infected cells. GRASP65, a Golgi-associated protein, physically associated with Fas and caspase-8; Bcl-X(L) expression decreased these associations. Bcl-X(L) expression also up-regulated FLIP, a caspase-8 inhibitor. In conclusion, Bcl-X(L) may inactivate caspase-8 by decreasing DISC formation in the plasma membrane, nucleus, and Golgi complex while diverting DISC formation to the mitochondria. The inhibitory effects of Bcl-X(L) on DISC formation may play significant roles in protecting endothelial cells from H/R-induced cell death."

We identified Ca2+/calmodulindependent protein kinase IIβ (CaMKIIβ) as a potential iPLA2β-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening of a cDNA library using iPLA2β cDNA as bait. Cloning CaMKIIβ cDNA from a rat islet library revealed that one dominant CaMKIIβ isoform mRNA is expressed by adult islets and is not observed in brain or neonatal islets and that there is high conservation of the isoform expressed by rat and human β-cells. Binary two-hybrid assays using DNA encoding this isoform as bait and iPLA2β DNA as prey confirmed interaction of the enzymes, as did assays with CaMKIIβ as prey and iPLA2β bait. His-tagged CaMKIIβ immobilized on metal affinity matrices bound iPLA2β, and this did not require exogenous calmodulin and was not prevented by a calmodulin antagonist or the Ca2+ chelator EGTA. Activities of both enzymes increased upon their association, and iPLA2β reaction products reduced CaMKIIβ activity. Both the iPLA2β inhibitor bromoenol lactone and the CaMKIIβ inhibitor KN93 reduced arachidonate release from INS-1 insulinoma cells, and both inhibit insulin secretion. CaMKIIβ and iPLA2β can be coimmunoprecipitated from INS-1 cells, and forskolin, which amplifies glucose-induced insulin secretion, increases the abundance of the immunoprecipitatable complex. These findings suggest that iPLA2β and CaMKIIβ form a signaling complex in β-cells, consistent with reports that both enzymes participate in insulin secretion and that their expression is coinduced upon differentiation of pancreatic progenitor to endocrine progenitor cells.

This interaction is demonstrated by multiple independent techniques, and the interaction affects both iPLA2β and CaMKIIβ activities, thereby defining a signaling complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The materials [γ-32P]ATP, 55 mCi/mmol (16:0/[14C]18:2)glycerophosphocholine [1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, rainbow molecular mass standards, enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent, and [3H]arachidonic acid were obtained from Amersham Biosciences.

Alkaline phosphatase and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Protease inhibitor mixture, kanamycin, ampicillin, ATP, calmodulin, autocamtide-3, arachidonic acid, lysophosphatidylcholine, calmodulin kinase II inhibitor KN93, common reagents, and salts were obtained from Sigma. Tetracycline was obtained from Invitrogen. Gentamicin and cell culture media were obtained from the Tissue Culture Support Center (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). TALON metal affinity resin, a rat brain cDNA library, AH109 yeast cells, and media for yeast two-hybrid screening were obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA).

The iPLA2β suicide substrate BEL was obtained from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI). Avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase was obtained from Roche Applied Science.Screening of a Rat Brain cDNA Library in the Yeast Two-hybrid System—A rat brain cDNA library cloned into pACT2 vector (containing the LEU2 gene for selection) to produce fusion between protein-encoding DNA sequences and the DNA activation domain of GAL4 was used as prey. To produce the bait construct, full-length iPLA2β cDNA cloned from rat pancreatic islets was ligated into the SalI-EcoRI sites of the two-hybrid BD pAS2-1 vector, which contained a TRP1 gene for selection, resulting in in-frame fusion of iPLA2β with the DNA binding domain of the yeast GAL4 protein. The fidelity of constructs was confirmed by automated sequencing. The yeast strain AH109 was used for screening assays, and this strain contains HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes. Expression of each of these genes is regulated by a distinct GAL4-responsive promoter under control of a GAL4-responsive upstream activation site. Lack of autonomous activation by the iPLA2β/DNA binding domain fusion product was demonstrated by plating cells transformed with bait alone on media lacking histidine. In these assays, both bait and prey plasmids were transformed simultaneously into AH109 yeast cells, which were plated on medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and allowed to grow at 30 °C for 4 days. Putative positive colonies were lifted onto filter paper and incubated with the chromogenic substrate X-gal. Interactions were confirmed when the blue β-galactosidase reaction product was evident after 4 h of incubation at room temperature. Plasmids were then recovered from yeast and transformed into DH5α bacterial cells using ampicillin for selection. Isolated plasmids were sequenced, and BLAST searches were performed against GenBank (NIH genetic sequence data base) to identify putative iPLA2β-interacting proteins.Molecular Cloning of CaMKIIβ cDNA from a Rat Islet Library—Total RNA was isolated from adult rat islets as described previously (5Ma Z.

First strand cDNA was transcribed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. PCR was performed using a pair of gene-specific primers designed from regions of cDNA sequence that are conserved in the mouse and rat brain CaMKIIβ cDNA sequences (sense, 5′-ATCGCCACCGCCATGGCCACC-3′; antisense, 5′-CAGGCGCAGCTCTCACTGCAG-3′). A PCR band of 1,650 bp was gel purified, ligated into pGEM-T vector, and transformed into DH5α cells for amplification. DNA was purified and sequenced using T3 and T7 primers and gene-specific primers.Binary Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—The iPLA2β cDNA was cloned from an adult rat islet library (5Ma Z. Ramanadham S.

Both bait and prey plasmids were transformed simultaneously into AH109 yeast cells, which were plated on restriction medium. After incubation (30 °C, 4 days), colonies were lifted onto filter paper and screened as described above. Colonies that produced the blue β-galactosidase reaction product were considered positive for the interaction between iPLA2β and CaMKIIβ.Cloning and Expression of His-tagged CaMKIIβ, His-tagged iPLA2β, and FLAG-tagged Proteins in Sf9 Cells—Recombinant proteins were expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions, as described in detail elsewhere (2Jenkins C.M.

The sequence of the insert was verified, and the plasmid was then transformed into DH10Bac cells. Recombinant bacmid DNA was isolated using an alkaline lysis protocol modified for high molecular weight plasmid purification. PCR analysis was performed with purified bacmid DNA and pUC/M13 forward and reverse primers to characterize the inserts in the recombinant bacmid DNA. The recombinant baculovirus was produced by transfecting the recombinant bacmid DNA into Sf9 cells. The baculovirus was amplified and used to infect Sf9 cell cultures to express the recombinant proteins (2Jenkins C.M. Wolf M.J. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol.

The membrane was washed and incubated for 1 h with polyclonal antibody (1:200) to iPLA2β or CaMKII. The membrane was then incubated with secondary antibody (1:30,000) coupled to horseradish peroxidase, and the antibody complex was visualized by ECL.Interaction of CaMKIIβ with iPLA2β and Protein Pull-down Assays—In some experiments, both iPLA2β and His-tagged CaMKIIβ proteins were coexpressed in Sf9 cells. The Sf9 cell cytosol containing iPLA2β and His-tagged CaMKIIβ proteins was mixed with TALON metal affinity resin in the presence or absence of added Ca2+/calmodulin, the calmodulin antagonist W13, or the Ca2+ chelator EGTA and incubated (room temperature, with shaking, for 1 h). The mixture was washed with 10 bed volumes of wash buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.8) twice and transferred onto a gravity-flow column. The His-tagged CaMKIIβ was eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 200 mm imidazole, pH 7.8) and collected in 0.5-ml fractions. Desorbed proteins were visualized by immunoblotting analyses with antibodies to iPLA2β or CaMKIIβ.In other experiments, iPLA2β protein was first expressed in Sf9 cells and purified as described previously (23Nowatzke W.

Cytosol was prepared from Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus containing cDNA that encoded His-tagged CaMKIIβ and mixed with 1 ml of TALON metal affinity resin, as described above. The resin was washed and mixed with purified iPLA2β protein. The mixture was then incubated (30 min at room temperature with shaking), washed three times, and loaded onto a 5-ml gravity-flow column. Bound proteins were desorbed with elution buffer, collected in 0.5-ml fractions, and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for iPLA2β or CaMKIIβ.Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged iPLA2β and CaMKIIβ Expressed in Sf9 Cells—Sf9 cells expressing FLAG-tagged iPLA2β, CaMKIIβ, or both were harvested by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in cell lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors, and homogenized by sonication. Cytosol was prepared by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 20 min) and incubated with 100 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin (2 h, 4 °C, gentle rotation) in the presence or absence of 10 mm Ca2+ chelator EGTA. Immunoprecipitated material was recovered by centrifugation and washed four times with wash buffer. Samples immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG affinity resin were eluted with elution buffer (0.1 m glycine, pH 3.5). Aliquots (30 μl) were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nylon membrane, and blotted with iPLA2β or CaMKIIβ antibodies (1:200) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:30,000).Enzyme Activity Assays—For CaMKIIβ activity assays, sample buffer (50 mm Pipes, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.75 mm CaCl2, 20 μg/ml calmodulin, 20 μm autocamtide-3, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, pH 7.4) was mixed with CaMKIIβ (final volume 50 μl) and incubated (30 °C, 3 min). Assays were initiated by adding His-tagged CaMKIIβ and terminated by adding 100 mm EDTA. Aliquots (30 μl) of the mixture were placed on Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose paper, which was washed with 75 mm H3PO4 and air-dried. Phosphorylated autocamtide-3 (a CaMKIIβ model substrate) was quantified by liquid scintillation counting of 32P. Control assays were performed without added Ca2+/calmodulin and with 10 mm EGTA.The iPLA2β activity assays were performed as described previously (5Ma Z. Ramanadham S. Kempe K. Chi X.S. Ladenson J.L.

Reactions were initiated by injecting 5 μl of 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]palmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphorylcholine (specific activity 50 mCi/mmol, final concentration 5 μm) in ethanol. The assay mixture was incubated (37 °C, 5 min, with shaking), and the reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl of butanol.

Among them, the Nef protein has been reported to harbor a major determinant of pathogenicity in AIDS-like disease. The goal of the present study was to determine whether Nef protein expressed in vivo by primary macrophages could induce a brain toxicity also affecting the behavior of the rat. To achieve this goal we grafted Nef-transduced macrophages into the rat hippocampus. Two months post-transplantation, we observed that Nef induces monocyte/macrophage recruitment, expression of TNF-alpha, and astrogliosis. No apoptotic event was detected. We further demonstrated that Nef neurotoxicity is associated with cognitive deficits."
https://openalex.org/W1997326229,"Although leukosialin (CD43) membrane expression decreases during neutrophil apoptosis, the CD43 molecule, unexpectedly, is neither proteolyzed nor internalized. We thus wondered whether it could be shed on bleb-derived membrane vesicles. Membrane blebbing is a transient event, hardly appreciated during the asynchronous, spontaneous apoptosis of neutrophils. Cell pre-synchronization at 15 °C made it possible to observe numerous blebbing neutrophils for a short 1-h period at 37 °C. CD43 down-regulation co-occurred with the blebbing stage and phosphatidylserine externalization, shortly after mitochondria depolarization and before nuclear condensation. Blebs detaching from the cell body were observed by time lapse fluorescence microscopy, and the release of bleb-derived vesicles was followed by flow cytometry. Phosphatidylserine externalization required caspases and protein kinase C (PKC) but not the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). By contrast, bleb formation and release was caspase- and PKC-independent but required an active MLCK, whereas CD43 down-regulation involved caspases but neither PKC nor MLCK. Furthermore, CD43 appeared mostly excluded from membrane blebs by electron microscopy. Thus, CD43 down-regulation does not result from the release of bleb-derived vesicles. Ultracentrifugation of apoptotic cell supernatants made it possible to recover <1 μm microparticles, which contained the entire CD43 molecule. These microparticles expressed neutrophil membrane markers such as CD11b, CD66b, and CD63, together with CD43. In conclusion, we show that the three early membrane events of apoptosis, namely blebbing, phosphatidylserine externalization, and CD43 down-regulation, result from different signaling pathways and can occur independently from one another.

The most obvious initial stages of neutrophil apoptosis occur at the plasma membrane as follows. (i) Cytoskeleton movements result in impressive membrane protrusions, described as membrane “budding” or “blebbing” (1Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar).

Dransfield I. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The consequence of phospholipid redistribution is the recognition of apoptotic neutrophils as targets for phagocytosis via a macrophage PS receptor (4Savill J. Fadok V. Henson P. Haslett C. Immunol.

The consequence of decreased expression of functional receptors such as adhesion molecules, phagocytic receptors, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine receptors, or TNF receptors is probably the turning off of neutrophil cellular functions (2Homburg C.H. de Haas M. von dem Borne A.E.

Martinez-Palencia R. Leyva-Cobian F. Brieva J.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The initial purpose of this work was to investigate the mechanism of apoptosis-dependent CD43 down-regulation during neutrophil apoptosis. Leukosialin (CD43) is the main sialoglycoprotein of the leukocyte plasma membrane, described both as an anti-adhesive and an adhesive molecule (9Ostberg E. Barth R. Frelinger J. Immunol.

Renesto P. Chignard M. Blood. 1996; 87: 1200-1202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During neutrophil apoptosis, CD43 expression also decreases but, as shown here and unlike what had been postulated (3Hart S.P. Ross J.A. Ross K. Haslett C. Dransfield I. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 7Dransfield I. Stocks S.C. Haslett C. Blood. 1995; 85: 3264-3273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), without proteolysis or internalization of the molecule. We thus investigated the release of membrane vesicles during neutrophil apoptosis in relation to the decreased expression of CD43. Here, for the first time, we analyze the mechanism of apoptosis-induced blebbing in neutrophils. We show that CD43 down-regulation parallels but does not result from membrane blebbing, with CD43 being released on microvesicles distinct from membrane blebs. 2Preliminary data from this work have been presented at the British Society Meeting on Apoptosis in Myeloid Cells, November 2003, Edinburgh, UK (see Ref. 61Nusbaum P.

Keller H. Maxfield F.R. Piller F. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Blood. 2000; 95: 2462-2470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was kindly donated by M. Fukuda (La Jolla, CA). The antibody was immunopurified on the recombinant protein. Neutrophils and Microparticles—EDTA-anti-coagulated blood was centrifuged at room temperature for 20 min at 150 × g, and the platelet-rich plasma was further centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 × g to pellet platelets. Blood cells were then resuspended in the platelet-poor plasma and centrifuged for 35 min at 700 × g on PolymorphPrep (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway) to obtain neutrophils. Residual erythrocytes were lysed by a 1-min step in 0.2% NaCl, and neutrophils were distributed in a 24-well PRIMARIA plate (BD Biosciences) at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were maintained at 15 °C overnight and then brought to 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator to promote apoptosis. Alternatively, fresh cells were incubated at 37 °C with gliotoxin and TNF-α, as described (17Ward C. Chilvers E.R. Lawson M.F. Pryde J.G. Fujihara S. Farrow S.N. Haslett C. Rossi A.G. J. Biol.

Neutrophils and the membrane vesicles analyzed in Fig. 6 were spun down at 350 × g and suspended in 10 μl of PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide (PBS-BSA-azide). They were treated at 4 °C for 20 min with 1 mg/ml heat-aggregated (30 min at 56 °C) goat IgG to block Fcγ receptors and then for 30 min with fluorescein thiocyanate- or PE-labeled anti-CDx antibodies. Washed cells were suspended in the annexin-binding buffer containing 2.5 mm CaCl2 and treated with PE- or allophycocyanin-labeled annexin V and 7AAD (Viaprobe) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Allophycocyanin-annexin V was required in samples containing bisindolylmaleimide or chelerythrine, which give an FL1 and FL2 back-ground fluorescent signal. Cells were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry on a BD Biosciences FACScalibur. When mentioned, cells were fixed and permeabilized before labeling with the fluorescence-activated cell sorter permeabilizing solution from BD Biosciences according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membrane vesicles were identified on the basis of forward scatter and side scatter analysis. FSC and SSC channels were set at logarithmic gain to analyze particles of various sizes, and an acquisition threshold was set on the forward scatter to reduce background signals. When mentioned, R2/R3 vesicles (see Fig. 6) were collected using a BD Biosciences FACSVantage cell sorter. All of these sorted vesicles were recovered by a 15-min centrifugation at 1,500 × g. They were cytocentrifuged (700 rpm, high acceleration, Shandon cytospin) on poly-l-lysincoated slides and analyzed by Hemacolor staining. Microparticles, collected in the 100,000 × g pellet, were labeled as described above with heat-aggregated IgGs and antibodies, which were previously ultracentrifuged for 20 min at 11,600 × g in a microfuge, and analyzed by flow cytometry with an FSC/SSC setting allowing the analysis of <1 μm particles with minimum background signals. Cell Analysis by DIC and Fluorescence Microscopy—To analyze cell morphology, neutrophils were fixed for 30 min at 4 °C in 1% glutaraldehyde and analyzed by differential interference contrast (DIC) light microscopy. The percentage of blebbing cells was determined microscopically by counting at least 100 cells for each condition. Membrane labeling with the membrane fluorescent probe PKH26 was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions for 10 min at 15 °C on neutrophils pre-incubated overnight at this temperature. Cells were washed and then incubated at 37 °C to induce apoptosis. Alternatively, neutrophils were labeled with an anti-CD43 or anti-CD11b antibody in PBS-BSA-azide on ice after the 15 and 37 °C incubations. They were then fixed for 30 min with 0.05% glutaraldehyde and 3% paraformaldehyde, incubated overnight in blocking solution (PBS-BSA-azide containing 2.5% AB group human serum), and treated with TRITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. They were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy on a Leica DMIRB microscope (×63 objective) equipped with an Olympus DP11 digital camera. Cytocentrifuged neutrophils, treated with Hemacolor staining, were observed by light microscopy. The percentage of apoptotic cells with a condensed nucleus was determined microscopically by counting at least 100 cells for each condition. Electron Microscopy—For morphologic examination, neutrophil samples were fixed with 1.5% glutaraldehyde, washed, post-fixed in OsO4, and embedded in Epon. For CD43 and CD11b distribution analysis, neutrophils were labeled at 4 °C with anti-CD43 or anti-CD11b mAbs as described above and then labeled with an immunogold-conjugated (10 nm) goat anti-mouse IgG (British Biocell, Cardiff, UK). Cells were then fixed with 1.25% glutaraldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C, washed, fixed with osmic acid, alcohol-dehydrated, and finally embedded in Epoxy resin. Thin sections were examined with a Philips CM 10 electron microscope (Philips, Eindoven, The Netherlands) after uranyl acetate and lead citrate staining. Time Lapse Fluorescence Microscopy—Membrane labeling with the fluorescent probe PKH26 was performed as described above. Cells were washed at 15 °C, brought to 37 °C for 30 min, deposited in a microwell dish with glass bottom (Mat Tek Corp. Ashland, MA) coated with poly-l-lysine, and maintained at 37 °C. Images were collected every 7 s on a Zeiss fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 135) equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (MicroMax 5 MHz, Princetown Instruments) driven by Metamorph Imaging System software (Universal Imaging). Quick Time movies were accelerated 100-fold. As a negative control, freshly isolated neutrophils, incubated in fetal calf serum-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h at 15 °C and then brought to 37 °C for up to 2 h, demonstrated no blebbing transformation when fixed with glutaraldehyde and analyzed by DIC microscopy or when applied on a poly-l-lysine-coated plate and observed directly on the inverted microscope (data not shown). Western Blotting—The neutrophil pellet was lysed in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm EDTA, and the protease inhibitors aprotinin (0.1 trypsin inhibitor unit/ml), leupeptin (100 μg/ml), chymostatin (20 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and 1,10-phenanthroline (1 mm). After a rapid centrifugation at 11,000 × g to remove nuclei, each lysate was supplemented with half its volume of 2× Laemmli SDS-reducing sample buffer and submitted to PAGE and transfer. Microparticle pellets were made soluble directly in boiling sample buffer. Western blots were incubated with an anti-CD43 mAb or the anti-CD43cyto pAb and then with peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG and revealed by chemiluminescence. When mentioned, actin was measured on the lower part of the membrane using a rabbit anti-actin antibody and alkaline phosphatase-labeled secondary antibody as revealed by colorimetry. This less sensitive detection assay allowed us to avoid saturation and to obtain concentration-related signals. Measure of Mitochondria Membrane Potential—This was measured by flow cytometry using the mitochondria fluorescent probe JC-1, as described (18Fossati G. Moulding D.A. Spiller D.G. Moots R.J. White M.R. Edwards S.W. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1964-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Briefly, neutrophils were pre-incubated overnight at 15 °C, washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum, incubated at 15 °C for 20 min with the mitochondria probe JC-1 (7.7 μm), washed, and then incubated at 37 °C to promote apoptosis. They were analyzed at different times by flow cytometry, and the proportion of apoptotic neutrophils with low mitochondria potential is expressed as a percentage of neutrophils with high FL1 mean fluorescent intensity. Statistical Analysis—Data obtained from apoptotic neutrophils versus control cells maintained at 15 °C or neutrophils with signaling inhibitors versus control neutrophils in medium were compared using a paired t test. Statistical significance was defined as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001 (Figs, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8).Fig. 3Qualitative and quantitative analysis of CD43 on apoptotic neutrophils:A, schematic representation of the transmembrane CD43 molecule showing anti-CD43 mAb and anti-CD43cyto pAb binding sites. B, cell lysates from freshly isolated neutrophils (Native), neutrophils kept at 15 °C overnight (O/N 15°) and then for 2 h at 37 °C (+ 2h 37°) or activated for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 ng/ml PMA (PMA), were separated by SDS-PAGE on 5-15% acrylamide gradient and analyzed by Western blot using either the anti-CD43 mAb (native cells) or the anti-CD43cyto pAb. C, serial dilutions of cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot with anti-CD43cyto pAb and anti-actin antibodies. Intensities of scanned CD43 and actin bands from cells pre-incubated overnight (O/N) at 15 °C with or without a further 2-hour incubation at 37 °C were plotted and compared. Results are expressed as the percentage of the CD43 band intensity measured in control cells at 15 °C and normalized with actin (mean ± S.D. of 4 or 5 experiments, see “Results”). *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01. D, CD43 expression was measured by flow cytometry on neutrophils permeabilized or not as described under “Materials and Methods.” Results are expressed as the MFI of cells incubated for 2 h at 37 °C × 100/MFI of control cells at 15 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 7Effects of caspase PKC and MLCK inhibition on apoptosis-related membrane events.A and B, neutrophils were pre-incubated at 15 °C overnight and then warmed up for 1.5 h at 37 °C in the presence of 50 μm Z-DEVD-fmk, 5 μm bisindolylmaleimide, or 50 μm ML9.

Stocks S.C. Haslett C. Blood. 1995; 85: 3264-3273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Fig. 1A shows that CD43 membrane expression decreases during neutrophil incubation for 20 h at 37 °C as compared with cells maintained at 4 °C. This decrease is not simultaneous in all neutrophils but involves only a subpopulation of CD43low neutrophils (M1 = 60% CD43low neutrophils in the example shown in Fig. 1A). This subpopulation of CD43low neutrophils also binds annexin V (Fig. 1B) and thus represents neutrophils undergoing apoptosis. The absence of labeling with the viability probe 7AAD (Fig. 1C) shows that these annexin-binding neutrophils (66% annexin+ neutrophils in the example shown here) have intact plasma membranes and are not necrotic cells. As expected, the kinetic appearance of the CD43low population during spontaneous apoptosis at 37 °C paralleled that of the annexin V binding (Fig. 1D). To analyze the kinetic of these membrane changes, it was convenient to accelerate the neutrophils' spontaneous apoptosis. We used a previously described protocol in which apoptosis is synchronized by maintaining neutrophils overnight at 15 °C before warming them at 37 °C (19Pryde J.G. Walker A. Rossi A.G. Hannah S. Haslett C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33574-33584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is arrested at 15 °C because of the failure of the insertion of proapoptotic Bax into mitochondria. Reheating at 37 °C results in a burst of synchronous apoptosis assessed by annexin V binding, cell morphology, a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling assay, and DNA laddering (19Pryde J.G. Walker A. Rossi A.G. Hannah S. Haslett C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33574-33584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Neutrophils incubated overnight at 15 °C express the same level of CD43 as freshly isolated cells (data not shown), whereas the 4 °C incubation tends to decrease this expression slightly (Fig. 1A). After overnight incubation at 15 °C and warming at 37 °C, we observed the appearance of CD43low neutrophils that started, together with annexin V binding, after 45-60 min of incubation at 37 °C and reached a plateau of 50 ± 20% apoptotic neutrophils after 1.5-2 h (Fig. 2A). CD43 down-regulation and PS externalization appeared as simultaneous events, whereas mitochondria membrane depolarization, assessed by the fluorescent shift of mitochondria probe JC-1 (18Fossati G. Moulding D.A. Spiller D.G. Moots R.J. White M.R. Edwards S.W. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1964-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), started earlier, after 20-30 min of incubation (Fig. 2B). Another protocol used to accelerate neutrophil apoptosis was the induction of apoptosis by TNF-α in the presence of the NF-κB inhibitor gliotoxin (17Ward C. Chilvers E.R. Lawson M.F. Pryde J.G. Fujihara S. Farrow S.N. Haslett C. Rossi A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4309-4318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). When freshly isolated neutrophils were incubated at 37 °C with 10 ng/ml TNF-α and 0.1 μg/ml gliotoxin, a population of annexin-binding and CD43low neutrophils appeared after 1.5 h of incubation and increased regularly up to 2.5 h of incubation (data not shown). These cell changes did not occur when gliotoxin was replaced by its inactive analogue methylthiogliotoxin. Fig. 2C shows the modulation of different markers on neutrophils pre-incubated overnight at 15 °C and then for 2 h at 37 °C as compared with control neutrophils maintained at 15 °C. As mentioned above, the expression of CD43 was decreased as was CD16 (receptor III for the Fc portion of IgG, also known as FcγRIII) expression, which is known to be down-regulated on apoptotic neutrophils (2Homburg C.H. de Haas M. von dem Borne A.E. Verhoeven A.J. Reutelingsperger C.P. Roos D. Blood. 1995; 85: 532-540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dransfield I. Buckle A.M. Savill J.S. McDowall A. Haslett C. Hogg N. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1254-1263PubMed Google Scholar), whereas we observed a significant increase of CD11b and a stable expression of CD11a. CD43 Decreased Expression Is Not Due to a Proteolytic Cleavage or Endocytosis—Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using either an anti-CD43 mAb that recognizes an extracellular epitope or a polyclonal antibody raised against the whole cytoplasmic domain of CD43 (anti-CD43cyto pAb) (Fig. 3A). This anti-CD43cyto pAb is a useful tool that makes it possible to visualize all cell-associated CD43 fragments even if the extracellular part of the molecule is cleaved or desialylated (3Hart S.P. Ross J.A. Ross K. Haslett C. Dransfield I. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In freshly isolated neutrophils lysed in the presence of protease inhibitors (Fig. 3B) or immediately boiled in reduced sample buffer (data not shown), the anti-CD43cyto pAb recognized the whole 140-kDa CD43 molecule designed by the anti-CD43 mAb as well as three minor 110-95-kDa bands, that could represent incompletely glycosylated CD43 or limited fragmentation during cell solubilization. Neutrophils incubated overnight at 15 °C showed the same Western blot CD43 pattern as freshly isolated cells, and no further cleavage occurred during the 2-hour apoptosis stage at 37 °C. By contrast, neutrophil activation by PMA resulted in cell-associated CD43 fragments (a major 95-kDa doublet and a 26-kDa band), confirming previous reports (14Remold O.D.E. Parent D. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3595-3605PubMed Google Scholar, 15Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Bessou G. Lesavre P. Renesto P. Chignard M. Blood. 1996; 87: 1200-1202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intensities of CD43 scanned bands, normalized for the actin content of the same samples, showed a significant decrease of the native CD43 band during synchronized apoptosis of neutrophils at 37 °C (Fig. 3C). The same decrease was observed in blots revealed by the anti-CD43cyto pAb recognizing the whole intracellular domain (p = 0.02, n = 4) and by the anti-CD43 mAb recognizing the extra-cellular portion of the molecule (p < 0.005, n = 5). Therefore, CD43 seems to be shed as an entire transmembrane molecule together with surrounding membrane structures. It is worth noting that the band immediately below the CD43 band, recognized by the anti-CD43cyt"

https://openalex.org/W2020891438,"Expression of smooth muscle α-actin in growth factor-induced myofibroblasts and in differentiated vascular smooth muscle cells is transcriptionally controlled by multiple positive or negative trans-acting factors interacting with distinct cis-elements in the 5′-flanking region of the gene. Because none of the transcriptional regulators reported to date is smooth muscle cell- or myofibroblast-specific per se, the dynamic interplay among many factors interacting at specific sites along the promoter appears to be a signature feature of smooth muscle α-actin gene regulation in these cell types. Herein, the ability of the adenovirus E1A 12 S protein to bind and functionally inactivate specific cell regulatory factors has been exploited to identify several previously unknown coactivators of the mouse smooth muscle α-actin promoter in rodent fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells. In transient cotransfection assays, ectopic expression of wild type E1A suppressed promoter activity in a dose- and cis-element-dependent manner. In asynchronous cells, N-terminal E1A mutants defective in CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 binding capacity exhibited markedly reduced inhibitory activity toward a smooth muscle α-actin promoter driven by a composite TEF-1-, SRF-, and Sp1/3-regulated enhancer. In synchronized cells, however, a more complex mutant E1A inhibitory pattern indicated that collaboration between CBP/p300 and the retinoblastoma family of pocket proteins was required to produce a fully functional enhancer. Cotransfection experiments conducted with Rb-/- fibroblasts demonstrated the necessity of pRB in augmenting smooth muscle α-actin enhancer/promoter activity. Physical interaction studies with the use of purified wild type and mutant E1A proteins confirmed that CBP, p300, and pRB were targets of E1A binding in nuclear extracts of vascular smooth muscle cells and/or fibroblasts. Collectively, these results suggest that a repertoire of E1A-interacting proteins, namely CBP/p300 and pRB, serve to integrate the activities of multiple trans-acting factors to control smooth muscle α-actin gene transcription in a cell type- and cell cycle-dependent manner.

Actin is the most abundant intracellular protein in the eukaryotic cell and accounts for ∼1–5% of the total cell protein in non-muscle cells and ∼10% in muscle cells (1Sheterline P. Sparrow J.C. Protein Profile. 1994; 1: 1-121PubMed Google Scholar). As a core component of the cytoskeleton, actin plays a vital role in regulation of cell locomotion, control of cell shape and division, organelle transport, and muscle contraction. The vertebrate actin family of cytoskeletal proteins is highly conserved and consists of six isoforms, which include four muscle-specific actins and two other non-muscle actins (2Vandekerckhove J. Weber K. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 126: 783-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The non-muscle β- and γ-actins are expressed in all cells and constitute the primary structural proteins of microfilaments. Genes encoding the non-muscle actins are members of the “immediate early” gene family, and their activation coincides with cell growth and proliferation. In the adult mammal, expression of the muscle-specific actins is much more restricted, and genes encoding the α-skeletal, α-cardiac, α-vascular smooth muscle, and γ-enteric smooth muscle isoforms are generally activated upon terminal differentiation in cells of myogenic lineage (3Sartorelli V. Kurabayashi M. Kedes L. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 925-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar, 5Parmacek M.S. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2001; 51: 69-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the vertebrate actin genes serve as convenient models for elucidating molecular mechanisms that promote what is generally considered to be mutually exclusive events, cell proliferation and cell differentiation. Our specific interest in smooth muscle α-actin (SMαA) 1The abbreviations used are: SMαA, smooth muscle α-actin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; E1A, adenovirus early region 1A; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FBS, fetal bovine serum; β-gal, β-galactosidase; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; pRB, retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein; SRF, serum response factor; TEF-1, transcription enhancer factor 1; TF, transcription factor; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor β1; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell; wt, wild type. gene regulation stems from the fact that, unlike the other muscle-specific actins, expression of this particular isoform is modulated in both myogenic and non-myogenic cell types in response to pathophysiologic de- or trans-differentiation signals. Such signals are produced during the progression of atherosclerosis and restenosis where inflammatory mediators, released at the site of arterial injury, induce the phenotypic conversion of quiescent contractile vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) into migratory growth-activated fibroblast-like cells that promote neointimal hyperplasia (6Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19370) Google Scholar, 7Libby P. Ridker P.M. Maseri A. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (5970) Google Scholar). Importantly, recent evidence suggests that this process, commonly referred to as phenotypic modulation, is not entirely restricted to medial VSMCs and may involve reprogramming of resident adventitial fibroblasts as well (8Sartore S. Chiavegato A. Faggin E. Franch R. Puato M. Ausoni S. Pauletto P. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 9Patel S. Shi Y. Niculescu R. Chung E.H. Martin J.L. Zalewski A. Circulation. 2000; 101: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This is a particularly intriguing notion because SMαA-expressing myofibroblasts have long been recognized as critical players in tissue repair in the context of wound healing (10Powell D.W. Mifflin R.C. Valentich J.D. Crowe S.E. Saada J.I. West A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1-C9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hinz B. Gabbiani G. Chaponnier C. J.

Thus, although arterial remodeling in response to atherogenic stimuli was once considered entirely pathogenic, this process may represent a physiological adaptation to injury, which may influence the overall vulnerability of an atherosclerotic plaque to lethal rupture (13Kolodgie F.D.

To gain greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic modulation in the vessel wall, our laboratories have focused on identifying the repertoire of cis-elements and trans-acting factors responsible for mediating both constitutive and inducible mouse SMαA gene expression in cultured fibroblasts and VSMCs. This effort was inspired by seminal studies demonstrating that the mouse SMαA gene was subject to differential regulation in myogenic versus non-myogenic cell types via functional interplay among multiple positive and negative cis-elements in concert with an assortment of ubiquitous and tissue-restricted transcription factors including the CArG motif-binding protein, serum response factor (SRF), the MCAT element-binding protein, transcription enhancer factor 1 (TEF-1), and several putative single-stranded DNA-binding repressors (14Foster D.N.

Subsequent identification and characterization of these 5′-polypurine-polypyrimidine tract-binding repressors as members of the Pur and Y box families of single-stranded DNA/RNA-binding proteins lent credence to the concept of a negatively regulated enhancer (18Kelm Jr., R.J.

The preceding work is consistent with findings of other investigators who have espoused a similar level of combinatorial complexity when SMαA gene regulation was evaluated in primary VSMCs (25Kumar M.S. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) or in the developing mouse (26Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ.

Invest. 2000; 106: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) suggests that VSMCs retain an adaptive flexibility that is similar to the myofibroblast during wound healing (30Serini G. Gabbiani G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Thus, plasticity of SMαA expression appears to be a requisite feature of certain cells types that are molecularly tailored to respond to environmental signals promoting either migration and growth (low SMαA, synthetic/activated phenotype (6Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19370) Google Scholar)) or immobilization and differentiation (high SMαA, contractile phenotype). As a consequence, it follows logically that regulation of cell cycle progression and SMαA gene expression must in some way be linked at the molecular level to permit cells to shift, at the most physiologically opportune time, between activated and contractile phenotypes during wound repair and vascular remodeling. In this report, we test the hypothesis that cell cycle progression and SMαA gene expression are coupled at the molecular level by evaluating the effect of the adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) 12 S protein, and selected mutants thereof, on core SMαA enhancer/promoter activity in asynchronous versus synchronized fibroblasts or VSMCs in vitro. The rationale for adopting this loss-of-function strategy is that the E1A 12 S protein contains multiple independent domains that serve as binding sites for certain well characterized transcription cofactors and cell cycle regulatory proteins implicated in modulating mammalian cell growth and differentiation (31Wang H.G. Rikitake Y. Carter M.C. Yaciuk P. Abraham S.E. Zerler B. Moran E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 476-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Bishopric N.H. Zeng G.Q. Sato B. Webster K.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2186-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As such, ectopically expressed E1A, by virtue of sequestration and functional inactivation of specific intracellular targets, can selectively alter transcription/expression of particular host cell genes critical to maintenance of cell phenotype. Importantly, E1A-dependent alteration of gene expression has been reported to produce dramatic changes in the phenotypic properties of certain myogenic and metastatic tumor cell types both in vitro and in vivo (34Flint J. Shenk T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 177-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 35Voigtlander C. Rand A. Liu S.L. Wilson T.J. Pittelkow M.R. Getz M.J. Kelm Jr., R.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 85: 54-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar and references therein). Herein, we have applied the E1A 12 S protein as a biochemical tool to physically and functionally expose the participation of members of the CBP/p300 family of histone acetyltransferases along with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) in modulating SMαA gene transcription under specific cell culture conditions. Our findings suggest a plausible regulatory connection between smooth muscle-like differentiation status and cell cycle progression and may offer new mechanistic insight into the process of phenotypic modulation of SMαA-expressing cell types. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—All cell lines were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in specific growth medium containing heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone). Mouse embryo-derived AKR-2B fibroblasts (15Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Elder P.K. Korf G.M. Foster D.N. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium (Invitrogen) plus 5% v/v FBS. Rat A7r5 VSMCs were maintained in high d-glucose (4.5 g/liter), low sodium bicarbonate (1.5 g/liter) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% v/v FBS. Rb-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 3.7 g/liter sodium bicarbonate and 10% v/v FBS. A7r5 cells were obtained from ATCC Bioresource Center, and Rb-/- MEFs were graciously provided by Tyler Jacks (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Experiments were performed with cell lines at passage 3–15. SMαA Promoter:Reporter and E1A Expression Plasmids—Construction and characterization of mouse SMαA promoter:chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter constructs (15Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J.

LeRoith D. Strauch A. Fagin J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1425-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and expression plasmids encoding wild type or mutant E1A (37Liu S.L. Rand A. Kelm Jr., R.J. Getz M.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3352-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have been described previously. Expression vector encoding pRB was kindly provided by William G. Kaelin, Jr. (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute). Expression plasmids encoding p107 and p130 were kindly provided by Brian Dynlacht (New York University School of Medicine). All plasmids used in transient transfection experiments were purified by double cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. Transient Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—Confluent cell monolayers in 175-mm flasks were trypsinized, and cells were suspended in growth medium for counting. Cells were seeded on 60-mm tissue culture dishes at a plating density of 2.0 × 105 for AKR-2B fibroblasts or 1.2 × 105 for A7r5 VSMCs or Rb-/- MEFs and were typically at 40–50% confluence after overnight incubation. Adherent cells were transfected with a fixed amount of DNA in 1 ml of serum-free medium with the use of GenePORTER transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems) at a ratio of 2 μl/μg DNA. Cells were routinely exposed to lipid/DNA mixtures consisting of 4.8 μg of VSMP-CAT reporter, 0.2 μg of pCMVβ (control β-galactosidase (β-gal) reporter), and selected amounts of pCI or pCI-E1A expression plasmid up to 2 μg. Empty pCI vector was added to keep the total amount of DNA transfected constant. After 3 h, cells were fed with complete growth medium and incubated for an additional 45 h. In some experiments, after a 16–18-h recovery period in complete growth medium, transfected cells were serum starved for 48 h in MCDB-402 (fibroblasts) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (VSMCs) then restimulated for 6 h with fresh medium plus 20% v/v FBS. Transfected cell monolayers were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and whole cell lysates were prepared by application of 0.5 ml of 1× CAT lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science) supplemented with protease inhibitors for 30 min. After centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm, cleared cell lysates were assayed for total protein content by BCA assay (Sigma) with the use of bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. CAT and β-gal reporter proteins were measured with the use of commercial immunoassay kits (Roche Applied Science). Reporter values were normalized for total cell protein. Transfections were routinely performed in triplicate or quadruplicate and repeated at least three times to ensure reproducibility. Data sets were subjected to analysis of variance to assess statistical significance at p < 0.05. Expression of E1A was verified by Western blotting of transfected cell lysates with the use of a monoclonal E1A antibody (M73, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) as described previously (37Liu S.L. Rand A. Kelm Jr., R.J. Getz M.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3352-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Blots were routinely reprobed with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (clone 6C5, Research Diagnostics, Inc.) to ensure equivalent protein loading. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Mouse AKR-2B fibroblasts or rat A7r5 VSMCs were cultured in complete growth medium in 175-mm flasks until the cells reached confluence. Cell monolayers were washed once with Versene 1:5000 (Invitrogen), and adherent cells were detached by brief exposure to 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen). Cells were then suspended in complete growth medium containing 5 or 10% FBS, transferred to 50-ml polypropylene tubes, and centrifuged at 450 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pelleted cells were gently resuspended with 40 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged at 450 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. This wash procedure was repeated two more times. After estimating the packed cell volume, cells were gently resuspended with a 10× volume of cold cytosolic extraction buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.25 m sucrose, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin A, aprotinin, and 0.2% v/v Triton X-100. Cells were rocked gently for 15 min at 4 °C. Lysed cells were then centrifuged at 3,220 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytosolic extract) was removed, and pelleted nuclei were extracted by addition of 5× the packed nuclear volume of cold nuclear extraction buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 25% v/v glycerol, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin. Nuclei were mixed vigorously with the use of a vortex shaker for 3 × 10 s. The extract was transferred to polypropylene tubes and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Cytosolic and nuclear extracts were stored at -80 °C. The protein concentration of cell extracts was determined by Bradford assay (Sigma) with the use of BSA as a standard. For pull-down assays, extracts of AKR-2B or A7r5 cells cultured either in complete growth medium or under serum-free conditions for 2 days were prepared as described previously (38Kelm Jr., R.J. Sun S. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24278-24285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Construction and Purification of His6-tagged E1A—Bacterial expression constructs encoding C-terminal histidine-tagged versions of wild type E1A 12 S protein and selected mutants were constructed by subcloning cDNAs released from pCI-E1Awt or mutant plasmids (37Liu S.L. Rand A. Kelm Jr., R.J. Getz M.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3352-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) into pQE70 (Qiagen). His-tagged E1A proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain M15 and purified with the use of Ni-NTA-agarose under denaturing conditions as directed by the manufacturer (Qiagen). Proteins were dialyzed extensively against renaturation buffer consisting of 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and quantified by BCA protein assay. His-tagged E1A protein was >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. Molar concentrations of E1A were calculated based upon amino acid composition-derived molecular masses of wild type or mutant proteins. Protein-Protein Interaction Assays—Pull-down assays were conducted as follows. AKR-2B or A7r5 nuclear protein was exchanged into binding buffer consisting of 10 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, using a NAP-5 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). 50 pmol of wild type or mutant His-tagged E1A was combined with 300 μg of nuclear protein in a total volume of 0.4 ml of binding buffer with 0.05% v/v Tween 20. Solutions were rocked gently for 2 h at 4 °C and then supplemented with 10 μl of Ni-NTA magnetic agarose beads (Qiagen) and incubated for 1 h. Beads were captured with a magnet and washed three times with 0.5 ml of binding buffer with 0.05% v/v Tween 20. His-tagged E1A and associated proteins were eluted by adding 50 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample preparation buffer consisting of 31 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% w/v SDS, 10% v/v glycerol, 5% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol and heating at 95 °C for 3 min. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with a monoclonal pRB antibody (G3-245, BD Biosciences) followed by a monoclonal E1A antibody (M73, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based protein-protein interaction method was also conducted with the use of purified His-tagged E1A proteins immobilized on 96-well EIA/RIA plates (Costar High Bind EasyWash, Corning Inc.) as follows. Selected concentrations of His-tagged E1A (wild type or mutant) diluted in coating buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 μg/ml BSA were applied at 100 μl/well. Wells exposed to coating buffer without E1A served as a control for nonspecific binding. After an overnight ∼18-h incubation at 4 °C, coating solution was removed by aspiration, and wells were washed twice with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA containing 0.05% v/v Tween 20. This was followed immediately by application of blocking buffer consisting of 2% w/v BSA (EIA/RIA grade, Sigma) dissolved in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA at 300 μl/well for 1 h at room temperature. After removal of blocking buffer, AKR-2B- or A7r5-derived nuclear protein diluted to 200 μg/ml in binding buffer consisting of 0.2% w/v BSA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% v/v Tween 20 was added at 100 μl/well in duplicate or triplicate. Plates were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C to allow binding of nuclear proteins to immobilized E1A. Protein solution was removed, and wells were washed three times. This was followed by the addition of primary antibodies against CBP, p300, or other selected transcription factors at 100 μl/well. In all cases, primary antibodies were diluted to 1.0 μg/ml in binding buffer. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, primary antibody solution was removed, and wells were washed three times prior to the addition of the appropriate secondary antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate at 100 μl/well. In all cases, secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were diluted 1:2,000 in binding buffer. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, wells were washed three times, and 100 μl of the horseradish peroxidase substrate ABTS (Roche Applied Science) was applied. Absorbance measurements at 405 nm were obtained 15 min after he addition of substrate with the use of a microplate reader (Molecular Devices). In control experiments, the coating efficiency of wild type versus mutant E1A was assessed with the use of either a murine monoclonal E1A antibody (M73, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or murine monoclonal His6 antibody (Qiagen) to detect immobilized His-tagged E1A after the BSA blocking step. The average coating efficiency of E1A d2–36 (amino acids 2–36 deleted) at all concentrations tested was found to be ∼0.82 relative to full-length wild type E1A (defined as 1.0). Binding data obtained for the d2–36 mutant were normalized to account for this modest difference in coating efficiency. Mapping of cis-Elements Required for E1A-mediated Repression of SMαA Promoter Activity in Fibroblasts and VSMCs— Previous reports have established that the E1A 12 S protein is capable of repressing skeletal and cardiac α-actin gene transcription and myogenic differentiation in vitro (39Webster K.A. Muscat G.E. Kedes L. Nature. 1988; 332: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether E1A would similarly affect SMαA gene transcription in cell types relevant to wound repair and arterial remodeling, transient cotransfection assays were performed with the use of a full-length mouse SMαA promoter:reporter construct or specific deletion mutants in the presence or absence of E1A 12 S expression plasmid in both A7r5 VSMCs and AKR-2B fibroblasts cultured under exponential growth conditions (Fig. 1). The SMαA promoter:reporter construct known as VSMP8 contains an ∼3.6-kbp contiguous region of the mouse SMαA gene extending from ∼1 kbp upstream of the start site of transcription through the first intron fused to the CAT reporter gene (Fig. 1A). This segment of the SMαA gene has been shown previously to promote robust smooth muscle-specific transgene expression in multiple transgenic"
