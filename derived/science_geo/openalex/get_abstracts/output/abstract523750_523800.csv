https://openalex.org/W1981244178,"A valid comparison of the magnitude of two correlations requires researchers to directly contrast the correlations using an appropriate statistical test. In many popular statistics packages, however, tests for the significance of the difference between correlations are missing. To close this gap, we introduce cocor, a free software package for the R programming language. The cocor package covers a broad range of tests including the comparisons of independent and dependent correlations with either overlapping or nonoverlapping variables. The package also includes an implementation of Zou’s confidence interval for all of these comparisons. The platform independent cocor package enhances the R statistical computing environment and is available for scripting. Two different graphical user interfaces—a plugin for RKWard and a web interface—make cocor a convenient and user-friendly tool."

We found that the average density of plastic (1 item per 4 m2), as well as its frequency of occurrence (100% of the sites sampled), are comparable to the accumulation zones described for the five subtropical ocean gyres. Plastic debris in the Mediterranean surface waters was dominated by millimeter-sized fragments, but showed a higher proportion of large plastic objects than that present in oceanic gyres, reflecting the closer connection with pollution sources. The accumulation of floating plastic in the Mediterranean Sea (between 1,000 and 3,000 tons) is likely related to the high human pressure together with the hydrodynamics of this semi-enclosed basin, with outflow mainly occurring through a deep water layer. Given the biological richness and concentration of economic activities in the Mediterranean Sea, the affects of plastic pollution on marine and human life are expected to be particularly frequent in this plastic accumulation region."

Chromatin is also a repository of regulatory information in the form of covalent marks added to the histones that package the DNA. These marks can determine tissue- and organ-specific gene expression patterns, which must be transmitted to daughter cells to maintain their identity. Ragunathan et al. and Audergon et al. show that in fission yeast, a chromatin mark, like genetic information, can be inherited across many cell generations. The mark can be inherited independently of DNA sequence, DNA methylation, or RNA interference. Thus, histone marks constitute true epigenetic information.

https://openalex.org/W2025914092,"Transition-metal complexes have long attracted interest for fundamental chemical reactivity studies and possible use in solar energy conversion1,2. Electronic excitation, ligand loss from the metal centre, or a combination of both, creates changes in charge and spin density at the metal site3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 that need to be controlled to optimize complexes for photocatalytic hydrogen production8 and selective carbon–hydrogen bond activation9,10,11. An understanding at the molecular level of how transition-metal complexes catalyse reactions, and in particular of the role of the short-lived and reactive intermediate states involved, will be critical for such optimization. However, suitable methods for detailed characterization of electronic excited states have been lacking. Here we show, with the use of X-ray laser-based femtosecond-resolution spectroscopy and advanced quantum chemical theory to probe the reaction dynamics of the benchmark transition-metal complex Fe(CO)5 in solution, that the photo-induced removal of CO generates the 16-electron Fe(CO)4 species, a homogeneous catalyst12,13 with an electron deficiency at the Fe centre14,15, in a hitherto unreported excited singlet state that either converts to the triplet ground state or combines with a CO or solvent molecule to regenerate a penta-coordinated Fe species on a sub-picosecond timescale. This finding, which resolves the debate about the relative importance of different spin channels in the photochemistry of Fe(CO)5 (refs 4, 16,17,18,19 and 20), was made possible by the ability of femtosecond X-ray spectroscopy to probe frontier-orbital interactions with atom specificity. We expect the method to be broadly applicable in the chemical sciences, and to complement approaches that probe structural dynamics in ultrafast processes. Mapping the frontier-orbital interactions with atom specificity using X-ray laser-based femtosecond-resolution spectroscopy reveals that spin crossover and ligation determine the sub-picosecond excited-state dynamics of a transition-metal complex in solution. Transition-metal complexes catalyse many reactions of fundamental and practical importance. Their performance is coupled to charge and spin density changes at the metal site caused by electronic excitation, ligand loss from the metal centre or a combination of both. Philippe Wernet et al. show that femtosecond X-ray spectroscopy and quantum chemical theory can deliver unprecedented molecular-level insight into the dynamics of the benchmark transition-metal complex Fe(CO)5, revealing that light-induced dissociation creates a previously unreported excited singlet species and its subsequent reactions. These insights are enabled by the ability of femtosecond X-ray spectroscopy to probe, with atom specificity, frontier-orbital interactions that lie at the heart of chemical transformation. The method, expected to be widely applicable, complements approaches that probe the structural changes accompanying ultrafast chemical reactions."

https://openalex.org/W2148085874,"The celebrated Hong, Ou and Mandel (HOM) effect is one of the simplest illustrations of two-particle interference, and is unique to the quantum realm. In the original experiment, two photons arriving simultaneously in the input channels of a beam-splitter were observed to always emerge together in one of the output channels. Here, we report on the realisation of a closely analogous experiment with atoms instead of photons. This opens the prospect of testing Bell's inequalities involving mechanical observables of massive particles, such as momentum, using methods inspired by quantum optics, with an eye on theories of the quantum-to-classical transition. Our work also demonstrates a new way to produce and benchmark twin-atom pairs that may be of interest for quantum information processing and quantum simulation."
https://openalex.org/W2023097392,"Planetary systems are born in the disks of gas, dust and rocky fragments that surround newly formed stars. Solid content assembles into ever-larger rocky fragments that eventually become planetary embryos. These then continue their growth by accreting leftover material in the disk. Concurrently, tidal effects in the disk cause a radial drift in the embryo orbits, a process known as migration. Fast inward migration is predicted by theory for embryos smaller than three to five Earth masses. With only inward migration, these embryos can only rarely become giant planets located at Earth's distance from the Sun and beyond, in contrast with observations. Here we report that asymmetries in the temperature rise associated with accreting infalling material produce a force (which gives rise to an effect that we call 'heating torque') that counteracts inward migration. This provides a channel for the formation of giant planets and also explains the strong planet-metallicity correlation found between the incidence of giant planets and the heavy-element abundance of the host stars."
https://openalex.org/W2150275054,"Coral reefs around US- and US-affiliated Pacific islands and atolls span wide oceanographic gradients and levels of human impact. Here we examine the relative influence of these factors on coral reef fish biomass, using data from a consistent large-scale ecosystem monitoring program conducted by scientific divers over the course of >2,000 hours of underwater observation at 1,934 sites, across ~40 islands and atolls. Consistent with previous smaller-scale studies, our results show sharp declines in reef fish biomass at relatively low human population density, followed by more gradual declines as human population density increased further. Adjusting for other factors, the highest levels of oceanic productivity among our study locations were associated with more than double the biomass of reef fishes (including ~4 times the biomass of planktivores and piscivores) compared to islands with lowest oceanic productivity. Our results emphasize that coral reef areas do not all have equal ability to sustain large reef fish stocks, and that what is natural varies significantly amongst locations. Comparisons of biomass estimates derived from visual surveys with predicted biomass in the absence of humans indicated that total reef fish biomass was depleted by 61% to 69% at populated islands in the Mariana Archipelago; by 20% to 78% in the Main Hawaiian islands; and by 21% to 56% in American Samoa."
https://openalex.org/W1985404222,"We focus on Internet rumors and present an empirical analysis and simulation results of their diffusion and convergence during emergencies. In particular, we study one rumor that appeared in the immediate aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011, which later turned out to be misinformation. By investigating whole Japanese tweets that were sent one week after the quake, we show that one correction tweet, which originated from a city hall account, diffused enormously. We also demonstrate a stochastic agent-based model, which is inspired by contagion model of epidemics SIR, can reproduce observed rumor dynamics. Our model can estimate the rumor infection rate as well as the number of people who still believe in the rumor that cannot be observed directly. For applications, rumor diffusion sizes can be estimated in various scenarios by combining our model with the real data."
https://openalex.org/W2034143797,"Background Since antibiotic resistance has become a worldwide public health concern and is in part related to physicians’ lack of knowledge, it is essential to focus our attention on healthcare profession students. The present study aims at evaluating the knowledge and attitudes of the School of Medicine’s students towards antibiotic usage and antibiotic resistance. Methods In December 2013, a cross sectional study was conducted amongst medical, dental, nursing and other health care profession students of the School of Medicine at the University of Torino. Students of all the academic years took part in this study. Questionnaires were submitted during regular lectures (only students who attended courses on one specific day were surveyed) and the data collected was analyzed using StataMP11 statistical software. Results Overall, 1,050 students were interviewed. The response rate was 100%. Around 20% of the sample stated that antibiotics are appropriate for viral infections and 15% of the students that they stop taking those drugs when symptoms decrease. Results of the multivariate analyses showed that females were more likely than males to take antibiotics only when prescribed (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.04–1.98). Interestingly, students with a relative working in a health-related field, as well as those who took at least one course of antibiotics in the last year, had a lower probability of taking those drugs only under prescription (OR = 0.69 95% CI: 0.49–0.97 and OR = 0.38 95% CI: 0.27–0.53, respectively). Conclusion The present paper shows how healthcare profession students do not practice what they know. Since those students will be a behavioral model for citizens and patients, it is important to generate more awareness around this issue throughout their studies. It would be advisable to introduce a specific course and training on antibiotics in the core curriculum of the School of Medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2014280716,"The marine epiphytic dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus is a toxicologically important genus responsible for ciguatera fish poisoning, the principal cause of non-bacterial illness associated with fish consumption. The genus currently contains species exhibiting either globular or anterior-posteriorly compressed morphologies with marked differences in cell shape and plate arrangement. Here we report a third globular, epiphytic and tychoplanktonic species from the coasts of Ubatuba, Brazil. The new species can be distinguished from G. yasumotoi and G. ruetzleri by its broader first apical plate that occupies a larger portion of the epitheca. Accordingly, phylogenetic trees from small subunit (SSU) and large subunit (LSU) ribosomal DNA sequences also showed strongly supported separation of the new species from the G. yasumotoi / G. ruetzleri group albeit with short distance. The molecular phylogenies, which included new sequences of the planktonic species Goniodoma polyedricum, further indicated that the globular species of Gambierdiscus formed a tight clade, clearly separated (with strong bootstrap support) from the clade of lenticular species including the type for Gambierdiscus. The morphological and molecular data in concert support the split of Gambierdiscus sensu lato into two genera. Gambierdiscus sensu stricto should be reserved for the species with lenticular shapes, highly compressed anterioposteriorly, with short-shank fishhook apical pore plate, large 2' plate, low and ascending cingular displacement, and pouch-like sulcal morphology. The new genus name Fukuyoa gen. nov. should be applied to the globular species, slightly laterally compressed, with long-shank fishhook apical pore plate, large 1' plate, greater and descending cingular displacement, and not pouch-like vertically-oriented sulcal morphology. Fukuyoa contains the new species Fukuyoa paulensis gen. et sp. nov., and F. yasumotoi comb. nov. and F. ruetzleri comb. nov."
https://openalex.org/W2090604778,"Glucocorticoid steroids modulate immunocompetence in complex ways with both immunoenhancing and immunosuppressive effects in vertebrates exposed to different stressors. Such bimodal effects have been associated with variation in duration and intensity of the stress response. Given that natural populations have been exposed to a multitude of stressors, a better understanding of the functional association between duration and intensity of the stress response, the resulting changes in glucocorticoid plasma levels and their impact on different aspects of immunocompetence emerges as a cornerstone for vertebrate conservation strategies. We investigated the effects of a restraint challenge (with and without movement restriction), long-term captivity, and transdermal corticosterone application on plasma levels of corticosterone (hereinafter referred to as CORT) and different parameters of innate immunocompetence in the male cururu toads (Rhinella icterica). We show that for R. icterica restraint for 24h proved to be a stressful condition, increasing CORT by 3-fold without consistent immunological changes. However, the application of a more intense stressor (restraint with movement restriction), for the same period, potentiated this response resulting in a 9-fold increase in CORT, associated with increase Neutrophil/Lymphocyte ratio (N:L) and a lower bacterial killing ability (BKA). Transdermal application of corticosterone efficiently mimics repeated acute stress response events, without changing the immune parameters even after 13 days of treatment. Interestingly, long-term captivity did not mitigate the stress response, since the toads maintained 3-fold increased CORT even after 3 months under these conditions. Moreover, long-term captivity in the same condition increased total leukocyte count (TLC) and generated an even greater decrease in BKA, suggesting that consequences of the stress response can be aggravated by time in captivity."
https://openalex.org/W2122965425,"Background Bacterial infections remain a challenge to solid organ transplantation. Due to the alarming spread of carbapenem-resistant gram negative bacteria, these organisms have been frequently recognized as cause of severe infections in solid organ transplant recipients. Methods and Findings Between 15 May and 30 September 2012 we enrolled 887 solid organ transplant recipients in Italy with the aim to describe the epidemiology of gram negative bacteria spreading, to explore potential risk factors and to assess the effect of early isolation of gram negative bacteria on recipients’ mortality during the first 90 days after transplantation. During the study period 185 clinical isolates of gram negative bacteria were reported, for an incidence of 2.39 per 1000 recipient-days. Positive cultures for gram negative bacteria occurred early after transplantation (median time 26 days; incidence rate 4.33, 1.67 and 1.14 per 1,000 recipient-days in the first, second and third month after SOT, respectively). Forty-nine of these clinical isolates were due to carbapenem-resistant gram negative bacteria (26.5%; incidence 0.63 per 1000 recipient-days). Carbapenems resistance was particularly frequent among Klebsiella spp. isolates (49.1%). Recipients with longer hospital stay and those who received either heart or lung graft were at the highest risk of testing positive for any gram negative bacteria. Moreover recipients with longer hospital stay, lung recipients and those admitted to hospital for more than 48h before transplantation had the highest probability to have culture(s) positive for carbapenem-resistant gram negative bacteria. Forty-four organ recipients died (0.57 per 1000 recipient-days) during the study period. Recipients with at least one positive culture for carbapenem-resistant gram negative bacteria had a 10.23-fold higher mortality rate than those who did not. Conclusion The isolation of gram-negative bacteria is most frequent among recipient with hospital stays >48 hours prior to transplant and in those receiving either heart or lung transplants. Carbapenem-resistant gram negative isolates are associated with significant mortality."

Cathepsins are most stable at acidic pH, although growing evidence indicates that they have physiologically relevant activity also at neutral pH. Post-translational proteolytic processing of mature chemokines is a key, yet underappreciated, level of chemokine regulation. Although the role of selected serine proteases and matrix metalloproteases in chemokine processing has long been known, little has been reported about the role of cysteine cathepsins. Here we evaluated cleavage of CXC ELR (CXCL1, -2, -3, -5, and -8) and non-ELR (CXCL9–12) chemokines by cysteine cathepsins B, K, L, and S at neutral pH by high resolution Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Whereas cathepsin B cleaved chemokines especially in the C-terminal region, cathepsins K, L, and S cleaved chemokines at the N terminus with glycosaminoglycans modulating cathepsin processing of chemokines. The functional consequences of the cleavages were determined by Ca2+ mobilization and chemotaxis assays. We show that cysteine cathepsins inactivate and in some cases degrade non-ELR CXC chemokines CXCL9–12.

https://openalex.org/W1971739759,"Prokineticins are angiogenic hormones that activate two G protein-coupled receptors: PKR1 and PKR2. PKR1 has emerged as a critical mediator of cardiovascular homeostasis and cardioprotection. Identification of non-peptide PKR1 agonists that contribute to myocardial repair and collateral vessel growth hold promises for treatment of heart diseases. Through a combination of in silico studies, medicinal chemistry, and pharmacological profiling approaches, we designed, synthesized, and characterized the first PKR1 agonists, demonstrating their cardioprotective activity against myocardial infarction (MI) in mice. Based on high throughput docking protocol, 250,000 compounds were computationally screened for putative PKR1 agonistic activity, using a homology model, and 10 virtual hits were pharmacologically evaluated. One hit internalizes PKR1, increases calcium release and activates ERK and Akt kinases. Among the 30 derivatives of the hit compound, the most potent derivative, IS20, was confirmed for its selectivity and specificity through genetic gain- and loss-of-function of PKR1. Importantly, IS20 prevented cardiac lesion formation and improved cardiac function after MI in mice, promoting proliferation of cardiac progenitor cells and neovasculogenesis. The preclinical investigation of the first PKR1 agonists provides a novel approach to promote cardiac neovasculogenesis after MI."
https://openalex.org/W2037007807,"Acetaldehyde (ACH) associated with alcoholic beverages is Group 1 carcinogen to humans (IARC/WHO). Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2), a major ACH eliminating enzyme, is genetically deficient in 30-50% of Eastern Asians. In alcohol drinkers, ALDH2-deficiency is a well-known risk factor for upper aerodigestive tract cancers, i.e., head and neck cancer and esophageal cancer. However, there is only a limited evidence for stomach cancer. In this study we demonstrated for the first time that ALDH2 deficiency results in markedly increased exposure of the gastric mucosa to acetaldehyde after intragastric administration of alcohol. Our finding provides concrete evidence for a causal relationship between acetaldehyde and gastric carcinogenesis. A plausible explanation is the gastric first pass metabolism of ethanol. The gastric mucosa expresses alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzymes catalyzing the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde, especially at the high ethanol concentrations prevailing in the stomach after the consumption of alcoholic beverages. The gastric mucosa also possesses the acetaldehyde-eliminating ALDH2 enzyme. Due to decreased mucosal ALDH2 activity, the elimination of ethanol-derived acetaldehyde is decreased, which results in its accumulation in the gastric juice. We also demonstrate that ALDH2 deficiency, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment, and L-cysteine cause independent changes in gastric juice and salivary acetaldehyde levels, indicating that intragastric acetaldehyde is locally regulated by gastric mucosal ADH and ALDH2 enzymes, and by oral microbes colonizing an achlorhydric stomach. Markedly elevated acetaldehyde levels were also found at low intragastric ethanol concentrations corresponding to the ethanol levels of many foodstuffs, beverages, and dairy products produced by fermentation. A capsule that slowly releases L-cysteine effectively eliminated acetaldehyde from the gastric juice of PPI-treated ALDH2-active and ALDH2-deficient subjects. These results provide entirely novel perspectives for the prevention of gastric cancer, especially in established risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W2008996553,"Ecosystem invasion by non-native, nitrogen-fixing species is a global phenomenon with serious ecological consequences. However, in the Mediterranean basin few studies addressed the impact of invasion by nitrogen-fixing shrubs on soil quality and hydrological properties at local scale, and the possible effects on succession dynamics and ecosystem invasibility by further species. In this multidisciplinary study we investigated the impact of Genista aetnensis (Biv.) DC., an exotic nitrogen-fixing shrub, on the Vesuvius Grand Cone (Southern Italy). Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that the invasion of G. aetnensis has a significant impact on soil quality, soil hydrological regime, local microclimate and plant community structure, and that its impact increases during the plant ontogenetic cycle. We showed that G. aetnensis, in a relatively short time-span (i.e. ~ 40 years), has been able to build-up an island of fertility under its canopy, by accumulating considerable stocks of C, N, and P in the soil, and by also improving the soil hydrological properties. Moreover, G. aetnensis mitigates the daily range of soil temperature, reducing the exposure of coexisting plants to extremely high temperatures and water loss by soil evaporation, particularly during the growing season. Such amelioration of soil quality, coupled with the mitigation of below-canopy microclimatic conditions, has enhanced plant colonization of the barren Grand Cone slopes, by both herbaceous and woody species. These results suggest that the invasion of G. aetnensis could eventually drive to the spread of other, more resource-demanding exotic species, promoting alternative successional trajectories that may dramatically affect the local landscape. Our study is the first record of the invasion of G. aetnensis, an additional example of the regime shifts driven by N-fixing shrubs in Mediterranean region. Further studies are needed to identity specific management practices that can limit the spread and impacts of this species."

https://openalex.org/W2051264225,"The objective of this research was to analyse whether ameliorating drought stress through exogenously applied spermine (Spm) was related to carbohydrate metabolism, dehydrins accumulation and the transcription of genes encoding dehydrins in two white clovers (drought-susceptible cv. ‘Ladino’ and drought-resistant cv. ‘Haifa’) under controlled drying conditions for 10 days. The results show that the application of Spm effectively alleviates negative effects caused by drought stress in both cultivars. Exogenous Spm led to accumulation of more water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC), sucrose, fructose and sorbitol in both cultivars under drought stress, and also significantly elevated glucose content in leaves of drought-resistant cv. ‘Haifa’, but had no effect on drought-susceptible cv. ‘Ladino’. Accordingly, the key enzyme activities of sucrose and sorbitol metabolism changed along with the application of Spm under drought stress. Spm induced a significant increase in sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) or sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, but decrease in sucrose synthetase (SS) activity when two cultivars were subjected to drought. In addition, the improved accumulation of dehydrins induced by exogenous Spm coincided with three genes expression which was responsible for dehydrins synthesis. But Spm-induced transcript level of dehydrin genes increased earlier in cv. ‘Ladino’ than that in cv. ‘Haifa’. Thus, these results suggest that ameliorating drought stress through exogenously applied Spm may be associated with increased carbohydrate accumulation and dehydrins synthesis. There are differences between drought-susceptible and -resistant white clover cultivars related to Spm regulation of WSC metabolism and dehydrins expression."

Using chemokine receptor activation as an example, we highlight the utility of this assay, demonstrating that only cells expressing a specific chemokine receptor are activated by cognate chemokine ligand. Furthermore, we describe a technique for simultaneously stimulating and monitoring calcium flux in vehicle and drug treated cells, demonstrating the effects of the Gαi inhibitor, pertussis toxin (PTX), on chemokine stimulated calcium flux. The described real time calcium flux assay provides a robust platform for characterizing cell activation within primary cells, and offers a more accurate technique for studying the effect of drug treatment on receptor activation in a heterogeneous population of primary cells."

During the evolution of higher plant chloroplasts from cyanobacteria, the SRP pathway underwent striking adaptations that enable the posttranslational transport of the abundant light-harvesting chlorophyll-a/b-binding proteins (LHCPs). The conserved 54-kDa SRP subunit in higher plant chloroplasts (cpSRP54) is not bound to an SRP RNA, an essential SRP component in bacteria, but forms a stable heterodimer with the chloroplast-specific cpSRP43. This heterodimeric cpSRP recognizes LHCP and delivers it to the thylakoid membrane whereby cpSRP43 plays a central role. This study shows that the cpSRP system in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii differs significantly from that of higher plants as cpSRP43 is not complexed to cpSRP54 in Chlamydomonas and cpSRP54 is not involved in LHCP recognition. This divergence is attributed to altered residues within the cpSRP54 tail and the second chromodomain of cpSRP43 that are crucial for the formation of the binding interface in Arabidopsis. These changes are highly conserved among chlorophytes, whereas all land plants contain cpSRP proteins with typical interaction motifs. These data demonstrate that the coevolution of LHCPs and cpSRP43 occurred independently of complex formation with cpSRP54 and that the interaction between cpSRP54 and cpSRP43 evolved later during the transition from chlorophytes to land plants.

https://openalex.org/W2129955233,"Obesity causes white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation and insulin resistance in some, but not all individuals. Here, we used a mouse model of early postnatal overfeeding to determine the role of neonatal nutrition in lifelong WAT inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. C57BL/6J mice were reared in small litters of 3 (SL) or normal litters of 7 pups (NL) and fed either regular chow or a 60% high fat diet (HFD) from 5 to 17 weeks. At weaning, SL mice did not develop WAT inflammation despite increased fat mass, although there was an up-regulation of WAT Arg1 and Tlr4 expression. On HFD, adult SL mice had greater inguinal fat mass compared to NL mice, however both groups showed similar increases in visceral fat depots and adipocyte hypertrophy. Despite the similar levels of visceral adiposity, SL-HFD mice displayed greater impairments in glucose homeostasis and more pronounced hepatic steatosis compared to NL-HFD mice. In addition, WAT from SL mice fed a HFD displayed greater crown-like structure formation, increased M1 macrophages, and higher cytokine gene expression. Together, these data suggest that early postnatal overnutrition may be a critical determinant of fatty liver and insulin resistance in obese adults by programming the inflammatory capacity of adipose tissue."

Although insufficient DNA resection hinders homology-directed repair and ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related)-dependent checkpoint activation, overresection produces excessive single-stranded DNA that could lead to genomic instability. However, the mechanisms controlling DNA end resection are poorly understood. Here we show that the major resection nuclease Exo1 is regulated both positively and negatively by protein-protein interactions to ensure a proper level of DNA resection. We have shown previously that the sliding DNA clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) associates with the C-terminal domain of Exo1 and promotes Exo1 damage association and DNA resection. In this report, we show that 14-3-3 proteins interact with a central region of Exo1 and negatively regulate Exo1 damage recruitment and subsequent resection. 14-3-3s limit Exo1 damage association, at least in part, by suppressing its association with PCNA. Disruption of the Exo1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins results in elevated sensitivity of cells to DNA damage.

https://openalex.org/W2001565566,"Growing global energy demands ensure the continued growth of energy development. Energy development in wildlife areas can significantly impact wildlife populations. Efforts to mitigate development impacts to wildlife are on-going, but the effectiveness of such efforts is seldom monitored or assessed. Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) are sensitive to energy development and likely serve as an effective umbrella species for other sagebrush-steppe obligate wildlife. We assessed the response of birds within an energy development area before and after the implementation of mitigation action. Additionally, we quantified changes in habitat distribution and abundance in pre- and post-mitigation landscapes. Sage-grouse avoidance of energy development at large spatial scales is well documented. We limited our research to directly within an energy development field in order to assess the influence of mitigation in close proximity to energy infrastructure. We used nest-location data (n = 488) within an energy development field to develop habitat selection models using logistic regression on data from 4 years of research prior to mitigation and for 4 years following the implementation of extensive mitigation efforts (e.g., decreased activity, buried powerlines). The post-mitigation habitat selection models indicated less avoidance of wells (well density β = 0.18 ± 0.08) than the pre-mitigation models (well density β = -0.09 ± 0.11). However, birds still avoided areas of high well density and nests were not found in areas with greater than 4 wells per km2 and the majority of nests (63%) were located in areas with ≤ 1 well per km2. Several other model coefficients differed between the two time periods and indicated stronger selection for sagebrush (pre-mitigation β = 0.30 ± 0.09; post-mitigation β = 0.82 ± 0.08) and less avoidance of rugged terrain (pre-mitigation β = -0.35 ± 0.12; post-mitigation β = -0.05 ± 0.09). Mitigation efforts implemented may be responsible for the measurable improvement in sage-grouse nesting habitats within the development area. However, we cannot reject alternative hypotheses concerning the influence of population density and intraspecific competition. Additionally, we were unable to assess the actual fitness consequences of mitigation or the source-sink dynamics of the habitats. We compared the pre-mitigation and post-mitigation models predicted as maps with habitats ranked from low to high relative probability of use (equal-area bins: 1 - 5). We found more improvement in habitat rank between the two time periods around mitigated wells compared to non-mitigated wells. Informed mitigation within energy development fields could help improve habitats within the field. We recommend that any mitigation effort include well-informed plans to monitor the effectiveness of the implemented mitigation actions that assess both habitat use and relevant fitness parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2003680452,"The indication of origin of sesame seeds and sesame oil is one of the important factors influencing its price, as it is produced in many regions worldwide and certain provenances are especially sought after. We joined stable carbon and hydrogen isotope analysis with DNA based molecular marker analysis to study their combined potential for the discrimination of different origins of sesame seeds. For the stable carbon and hydrogen isotope data a positive correlation between both isotope parameters was observed, indicating a dominant combined influence of climate and water availability. This enabled discrimination between sesame samples from tropical and subtropical/moderate climatic provenances. Carbon isotope values also showed differences between oil from black and white sesame seeds from identical locations, indicating higher water use efficiency of plants producing black seeds. DNA based markers gave independent evidence for geographic variation as well as provided information on the genetic relatedness of the investigated samples. Depending on the differences in ambient environmental conditions and in the genotypic fingerprint, a combination of both analytical methods is a very powerful tool to assess the declared geographic origin. To our knowledge this is the first paper on food authenticity combining the stable isotope analysis of bio-elements with DNA based markers and their combined statistical analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2015593252,"Background Pregnancy increases susceptibility to influenza. The placenta releases an immunosuppressive endogenous retroviral protein syncytin-1. We hypothesised that exposure of peripheral monocytes (PBMCs) to syncytin-1 would impair responses to H1N1pdm09 influenza. Methods and Findings Recombinant syncytin-1 was produced. PBMCs from non-pregnant women (n=10) were exposed to H1N1pdm09 in the presence and absence of syncytin-1 and compared to responses of PBMCs from pregnant women (n=12). PBMCs were characterised using flow cytometry, release of interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-λ, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-1β were measured by cytometric bead array or ELISA. Exposure of PBMCs to H1N1pdm09 resulted in the release of IFN-α, (14,787 pg/mL, 95% CI 7311-22,264 pg/mL) IFN-λ (1486 pg/mL, 95% CI 756-2216 pg/mL) and IFN-γ (852 pg/mL, 95% CI 193-1511 pg/mL) after 48 hours. This was significantly impaired in pregnant women (IFN-α; p<0.0001 and IFN-λ; p<0.001). Furthermore, in the presence of syncytin-1, PBMCs demonstrated marked reductions in IFN-α and IFN-λ, while enhanced release of IL-10 as well as IL-6 and IL-1β. Conclusions Our data indicates that a placental derived protein, syncytin-1 may be responsible for the heightened vulnerability of pregnant women to influenza."
https://openalex.org/W1999985352,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a parasitic protozoon infection caused by the Leishmania species and transmitted by sandflies. Patients acquire VL in five main tropical areas and the Mediterranean basin, and clinicians from non-endemic regions regularly see infected patients. We describe the population presenting with VL to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases (HTD), London and identify risk factors for developing VL. Methods and Principal Findings A retrospective study of imported VL to the HTD, London including patients diagnosed and/or managed at the HTD between January 1995 and July 2013. We analyse patient demographics, risk factors for developing VL, diagnosis, investigation, management and outcome. Twenty-eight patients were treated for VL at the HTD over an 18 year period. The median age at VL diagnosis was 44 years (range 4–87 years) with a male to female ratio of 2:1. Most patients were British and acquired their infection in the Mediterranean basin. The median time from first symptom to diagnosis was six months with a range of 1–12 months and diagnosis included microscopic visualisation of leishmania amastigotes, positive serological tests (DAT and k39 antibody) or identification of leishmania DNA. Nineteen patients had some form of immunocompromise and this has increased proportionally compared to previously described data. Within the immunocompromised group, the ratio of those with autoimmune disease has increased. Immunocompromised patients had lower cure and higher relapse rates. Conclusions The rise of VL in patients with immunocompromise secondary to autoimmune disease on immunomodulatory drugs presents new diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. VL should be a differential diagnosis in immunocompromised patients with pyrexia of unknown origin returning from travel in leishmania endemic areas."

As a result, social influence is often presented in a negative light. Here, we show the benefits of social influence for cultural markets. We present a policy that uses product quality, appeal, position bias and social influence to maximize expected profits in the market. Our computational experiments show that our profit-maximizing policy leverages social influence to produce significant performance benefits for the market, while our theoretical analysis proves that our policy outperforms in expectation any policy not displaying social signals. Our results contrast with earlier work which focused on showing the unpredictability and inequalities created by social influence. Not only do we show for the first time that, under our policy, dynamically showing consumers positive social signals increases the expected profit of the seller in cultural markets. We also show that, in reasonable settings, our profit-maximizing policy does not introduce significant unpredictability and identifies ""blockbusters"". Overall, these results shed new light on the nature of social influence and how it can be leveraged for the benefits of the market."
https://openalex.org/W2020098106,"1,1,2-trichloroethane (1,1,2-TCA) has become a common groundwater pollutant due to historically extensive utilization, improper disposal, as well as from incomplete dechlorination of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane. Currently, limited information is available on microbial detoxification of 1,1,2-TCA. Desulfitobacterium sp. strain PR, which was isolated from an anaerobic bioreactor maintained to dechlorinate chloroethenes/ethanes, exhibited the capacity to dechlorinate 1,1,1-trichloroethane and chloroform. In this study, the dechlorinating ability of strain PR was further explored. Strain PR showed the capability to dechlorinate 1,1,2-TCA (~1.12 mM) predominantly to 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) and chloroethane, and to trace amounts of vinyl chloride and ethene within 20 days. Strain PR coupled growth with dechlorination of 1,1,2-TCA to 1,2-DCA, while no cell growth was observed with dechlorination of 1,2-DCA to chloroethane. Later, through transcriptomic and enzymatic analysis, the reductive dehalogenase CtrA, which was previously reported to be responsible for 1,1,1-trichloroethane and chloroform dechlorination, was identified as the 1,1,2-TCA reductive dehalogenase. Since trichloroethene (TCE) is usually co-contaminated with 1,1,2-TCA, a co-culture containing Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain 11a capable of detoxifying TCE and 1,2-DCA and strain PR was established. Interestingly, this co-culture dechlorinated 1,1,2-TCA and TCE to the non-toxic end-product ethene within 48 days without chloroethane production. This novel pathway avoids production of the carcinogenic intermediate dechlorination product vinyl chloride, providing a more environmentally friendly strategy to treat 1,1,2-TCA."
https://openalex.org/W2085354126,"In response to the widespread use of control strategies such as Insecticide Treated Nets (ITN), Anopheles mosquitoes have evolved various resistance mechanisms. Kdr is a mutation that provides physiological resistance to the pyrethroid insecticides family (PYR). In the present study, we investigated the effect of the Kdr mutation on the ability of female An. gambiae to locate and penetrate a 1cm-diameter hole in a piece of netting, either treated with insecticide or untreated, to reach a bait in a wind tunnel. Kdr homozygous, PYR-resistant mosquitoes were the least efficient at penetrating an untreated damaged net, with about 51% [39-63] success rate compared to 80% [70-90] and 78% [65-91] for homozygous susceptible and heterozygous respectively. This reduced efficiency, likely due to reduced host-seeking activity, as revealed by mosquito video-tracking, is evidence of a recessive behavioral cost of the mutation. Kdr heterozygous mosquitoes were the most efficient at penetrating nets treated with PYR insecticide, thus providing evidence for overdominance, the rarely-described case of heterozygote advantage conveyed by a single locus. The study also highlights the remarkable capacity of female mosquitoes, whether PYR-resistant or not, to locate holes in bed-nets."

The latter modification can then lead to degradation by the proteasome (33.Uzunova K. Göttsche K. Miteva M. Weisshaar S.R. Glanemann C. Schnellhardt M. Niessen M. Scheel H. Hofmann K. Johnson E.S.

Sumoylation is a cyclic process of conjugation and deconjugation. SUMO molecules are synthesized as inactive precursors, which require processing to expose a diglycine motif at the C terminus, thereby becoming conjugation-competent (34.Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G.

Both precursor processing and deconjugation are carried out by specialized cysteine proteases. Although there are >20 different deubiquitylating enzymes known in S. cerevisiae (35.Hutchins A.P.

Another structurally distinct protein, the metalloprotease Wss1, has been suggested to remove ubiquitin from SUMO and to depolymerize SUMO chains; the latter activity, however, is controversial (39.Mullen J.R. Chen C.F. Brill S.J. Wss1 is a SUMO-dependent isopeptidase that interacts genetically with the Slx5-Slx8 SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase.Mol. Cell.

Two classes of SUMO-specific cysteine proteases have been identified. The first one is the Ulp/SENP group. More recently, the mammalian desumoylating isopeptidase 1 (DeSI-1) protein has been identified as a SUMO-specific protease, the active site cysteine residue of which resides in a papain-like fold that is structurally distinct from the Ulp fold (42.Shin E.J.

SUMO-cleaving proteases of the Ulp/SENP group share a Ulp domain (UD) as a common feature. The UDs comprise ∼200 amino acids and provide the SUMO peptidase activity (43.Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Ulp1-SUMO crystal structure and genetic analysis reveal conserved interactions and a regulatory element essential for cell growth in yeast.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). ∼27% identity is found between the UDs of Ulp1 and Ulp2, whereas their non-catalytic domains exhibit no obvious similarity (37.Li S.J.

SENPs showing unconventional domain architecture (namely SENP6 and SENP7) are part of the Ulp2-containing branch; the others belong to the Ulp1 family (44.Mukhopadhyay D. Dasso M.

Function and regulation of SUMO proteases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Ulp1 and Ulp2 have a distinct subset of substrates and non-redundant functions. Ulp1 is essential in S. cerevisiae and localizes to the nuclear pore (37.Li S.J. Hochstrasser M.

Johnson E.S. Dohmen R.J. SUMO conjugation and deconjugation.Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). One of its essential functions is Smt3 precursor processing, but it is also involved in deconjugation of Smt3 from substrates (36.Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. A new protease required for cell-cycle progression in yeast.Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). By contrast, Ulp2 is found in the nucleoplasm, does not process Smt3 precursors efficiently, and is primarily active in poly-Smt3 chain deconjugation (19.Bylebyl G.R. Belichenko I. Johnson E.S.

Genet. 2000; 263: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Even though dispensable for vegetative growth, Ulp2 is involved in re-commencement of cell cycle progression after checkpoint arrest, chromosomal segregation, and meiosis (37.Li S.J. Hochstrasser M.

The Ulp2 SUMO protease is required for cell division following termination of the DNA damage checkpoint.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6948-6961Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of Ulp2 has been found to be necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization of the protease, whereas the C-terminal non-catalytic domain is required for efficient depolymerization of large poly-Smt3 conjugates in vivo (52.Kroetz M.B. Su D. Hochstrasser M. Essential role of nuclear localization for yeast Ulp2 SUMO protease function.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 2196-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Even though poly-SUMO chains appear to be of low abundance in wild-type cells under favorable conditions, dismantling these chains appears to be important for cell vitality. In the absence of Ulp2, high molecular weight conjugates accumulate in cells (19.Bylebyl G.R. Belichenko I. Johnson E.S. The SUMO isopeptidase Ulp2 prevents accumulation of SUMO chains in yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44113-44120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Ulp2Δ mutants suffer from a severe growth defect, elevated levels of chromosome loss, and sensitivity to several different stresses (37.Li S.J. Hochstrasser M.

Cell. 2002; 9: 1169-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). These severe phenotypes are efficiently suppressed by replacing Smt3 with mutated versions impaired in the formation of chains due to mutations or deletions of the relevant Lys residues in the N-terminal domain (19.Bylebyl G.R. Belichenko I. Johnson E.S. The SUMO isopeptidase Ulp2 prevents accumulation of SUMO chains in yeast.J. Biol.

Chem. 2007; 282: 34167-34175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Together these data indicated that Ulp2 has an important role in Smt3 homeostasis by controlling the abundance of poly-sumoylated proteins. Although a domain of Ulp1 has been crystallized and its enzymatic mechanism studied in some detail (43.Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Ulp1-SUMO crystal structure and genetic analysis reveal conserved interactions and a regulatory element essential for cell growth in yeast.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), very little is known about the Ulp2 enzyme. One of the main reasons for this is that Ulp2 does not lend itself well to analysis. Yield and purification efficiency of recombinant Ulp2 is poor, and in vitro it exhibits only weak activity (19.Bylebyl G.R. Belichenko I. Johnson E.S.

The non-catalytic domains of Ulp2 have been predicted to be intrinsically disordered to a large extent (52.Kroetz M.B. Su D. Hochstrasser M. Essential role of nuclear localization for yeast Ulp2 SUMO protease function.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 2196-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, SENP6 and SENP7 are the human SUMO-specific proteases closest to yeast Ulp2. Like Ulp2, SENP6 and SENP7 concentrate in the nucleus, although at least SENP6 is also found in the cytoplasm (56.Mukhopadhyay D. Ayaydin F. Kolli N. Tan S.H. Anan T. Kametaka A. Azuma Y.

Consistent with a role in chain depolymerization, SENP6 and SENP7 show a clear preference for SUMO2/3 over SUMO1 (56.Mukhopadhyay D. Ayaydin F. Kolli N. Tan S.H. Anan T. Kametaka A. Azuma Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14102-14106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). SENP6 was found to be inactive for deconjugation of model substrates with single SUMO moieties and prefers substrates with three or more SUMO2/3 moieties (56.Mukhopadhyay D. Ayaydin F. Kolli N. Tan S.H. Anan T. Kametaka A. Azuma Y. Wilkinson K.D. Dasso M. SUSP1 antagonizes formation of highly SUMO2/3-conjugated species.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 939-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In 2011 a study on the mechanism of SUMO chain disassembly by SENP6 was published and pointed toward a stochastic mechanism for that enzyme (60.Békés M. Prudden J. Srikumar T. Raught B. Boddy M.N.

The authors surmised that this might be a mechanism shared by all SENPs and possibly non-human desumoylation enzymes as well.

All of the patients were treated with Peg-IFN α-2a at 180 μg weekly for 24 or 48 weeks. The hepatitis B serological markers and viral loads were tested every 3 months until 1 year after stopping Peg-IFN therapy. The endpoints were HBV DNA <2000IU/mL, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion, and a hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss at 12 months post-treatment.In HBeAg-positive patients, 25.0%, 29.2%, and 12.5% of the patients achieved HBeAg seroconversion, HBV DNA <2000 IU/mL and a combined response, respectively, at 12 months post-treatment. Prior IFN therapy, a high baseline ALT level, a low creatinine level, undetectable HBV DNA at 12 weeks and a decline in HBV DNA >2 log10 IU/mL at 12 weeks of therapy were factors associated with treatment response. In HBeAg-negative patients, 9.1%, 15.2%, and 6.1% of the patients achieved undetectable HBV DNA, HBV DNA <2000 IU/mL, and an HBsAg loss, respectively, at 12 months post-treatment. No factor was significantly associated with the treatment response in the HBeAg-negative patients. The median HBsAg level declined from 3.4 to 2.6 log10 IU/mL in all the patients, and the 5-year cumulative rate of the HBsAg loss was 9.8% in the HBeAg-negative patients. Overall, none of the patients prematurely discontinued the Peg-IFN therapy.Peg-IFN re-treatment is effective for a proportion of HBeAg-positive treatment-experienced patients; it has limited efficacy for HBeAg-negative treatment-experienced patients. Peg-IFN might facilitate HBsAg loss in HBeAg-negative treatment-experienced patients."
https://openalex.org/W2022490353,"Economic growth in Central Arizona, as in other semiarid systems characterized by low and variable rainfall, has historically depended on the effectiveness of strategies to manage water supply risks. Traditionally, the management of supply risks includes three elements: hard infrastructures, landscape management within the watershed, and a supporting set of institutions of which water markets are frequently the most important. In this paper we model the interactions between these elements. A forest restoration initiative in Central Arizona (the Four Forest Restoration Initiative, or 4FRI) will result in thinning of ponderosa pine forests in the upper watershed, with potential implications for both sedimentation rates and water delivery to reservoirs. Specifically, we model the net effect of ponderosa pine forest thinning across the Salt and Verde River watersheds on the reliability and cost of water supply to the Phoenix metropolitan area. We conclude that the sediment impacts of forest thinning (up to 50% of canopy cover) are unlikely to compromise the reliability of the reservoir system while thinning has the potential to increase annual water supply by 8%. This represents an estimated net present value of surface water storage of $104 million, considering both water consumption and hydropower generation."
https://openalex.org/W2000597151,"In this work, we identify physical and genetic interactions that implicate E3 identified by differential display (EDD) in promoting spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) function. During mitosis, the SAC initiates a mitotic checkpoint in response to chromosomes with kinetochores unattached to spindle pole microtubules. Similar to Budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles-related 1 (BUBR1) siRNA, a bona fide SAC component, EDD siRNA abrogated G2/M accumulation in response to the mitotic destabilizing agent nocodazole. Furthermore, EDD siRNA reduced mitotic cell viability and, in nocodazole-treated cells, increased expression of the promitotic progression protein cell division cycle 20 (CDC20). Copurification studies also identified physical interactions with CDC20, BUBR1, and other components of the SAC. Taken together, these observations highlight the potential role of EDD in regulating mitotic progression and the cellular response to perturbed mitosis."

The concept is now extended to 94 patients on treatment, 4 days per week or less, over a median of 2.7 discontinuous treatment years per patient. On suppressive combinations, 94 patients volunteered to treatment, 5 and 4 days per week, or reduced stepwise to 4,3,2, and 1 days per week in 94, 84, 66, and 12 patients, respectively, on various triple, standard, antiviral combinations, or nonregistered, quadruple, antiviral combinations. Ninety-four patients on treatment 4 days per week aggregated 165 intermittent treatment years; no viral breakthrough was observed over 87 average treatment weeks per patient, 63 of 94 having passed 2.5 intermittent treatment years on any of the antiviral combinations prescribed. On the hyperintermittent treatment of 3, 2, and 1 days per week, HIV RNA surged >50 copies, 4 weeks apart, in 18 instances (6.8 viral escapes/100 hyperdiscontinuous maintenance years). Viral escapes could have been a result of erratic adherence (EA) to regimen or follow-up (3 patients)—drug taken at half of the daily recommended dosage (8 patients) and/or overlooked archival-resistant HIVs from antecedent treatment failures (6 patients). Aside from the above circumstances, HIV unexpectedly rebounded in 3 patients on 2 days per week treatment and 1 patient on 1 day per week treatment, posting 2.2 intrinsic viral escapes/100 highly discontinuous treatment years. All 18 escapes were eventually reversed by 7 days per week salvage combinations, and 11 of 18 patients have been back for a second course of intermittent therapy, 4 days per week or less. Both cell-activation markers on the surface of T lymphocytes and cell-bound HIV DNA levels remained stable or declined. CD4/CD8 ratios rose to ≤1 in 35% of patients, whereas CD4 counts went ≤500/μl in 75%. These values were previously 7 and 40%, respectively, on 7 days per week therapy. In our aging, long, HIV-enduring, multitreated patient cohort, treatment 4 days per week and less over 421 intermittent treatment years reduced prescription medicines by 60%—equivalent to 3 drug-free/3 virus-free remission year per patient—actually sparing €3 million on just 94 patients at the cost of 2.2 intrinsic viral failure/100 hyperintermittent treatment years. At no risk of viral escape, maintenance therapy, 4 days per week, would quasiuniversally offer 40% cuts off of current overprescriptions.—Leibowitch, J., Mathez, D., de Truchis, P., Ledu, D., Melchior, J.

https://openalex.org/W2013075082,"Interactions between cohesin and dockerin modules play a crucial role in the assembly of multienzyme cellulosome complexes. Although intraspecies cohesin and dockerin modules bind in general with high affinity but indiscriminately, cross-species binding is rare. Here, we combined ELISA-based experiments with Rosetta-based computational design to evaluate the contribution of distinct residues at the Clostridium thermocellum cohesin-dockerin interface to binding affinity, specificity, and promiscuity. We found that single mutations can show distinct and significant effects on binding affinity and specificity. In particular, mutations at cohesin position Asn37 show dramatic variability in their effect on dockerin binding affinity and specificity: the N37A mutant binds promiscuously both to cognate (C. thermocellum) as well as to non-cognate Clostridium cellulolyticum dockerin. N37L in turn switches binding specificity: compared with the wild-type C. thermocellum cohesin, this mutant shows significantly increased preference for C. cellulolyticum dockerin combined with strongly reduced binding to its cognate C. thermocellum dockerin. The observation that a single mutation can overcome the naturally observed specificity barrier provides insights into the evolutionary dynamics of this system that allows rapid modulation of binding specificity within a high affinity background.Background: Cellulosomal cohesin-dockerin interactions show intraspecies promiscuity but interspecies specificity.Results: A combination of computations and experiments reveals single cohesin residue mutations with dramatic effects not only on binding affinity but also on specificity and promiscuity.Conclusion: Natural interspecies specificity barriers in the cohesin-dockerin interaction are easily overcome by single mutations, indicating considerable plasticity.Significance: This study sheds light on the malleability and evolvability of a high affinity interaction.

https://openalex.org/W2166480460,"Background There is compelling evidence in humans that peripheral endocannabinoid signaling is disrupted in obesity. However, little is known about the corresponding central signaling. Here, we have investigated the relationship between gender, leptin, body mass index (BMI) and levels of the endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of primarily overweight to obese patients with osteoarthritis. Methodology/Principal Findings Patients (20 females, 15 males, age range 44-78 years, BMI range 24-42) undergoing total knee arthroplasty for end-stage osteoarthritis were recruited for the study. Endocannabinoids were quantified by liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry. AEA and 2-AG levels in the serum and CSF did not correlate with either age or BMI. However, 2-AG levels in the CSF, but not serum, correlated negatively with CSF leptin levels (Spearman’s ρ -0.48, P=0.0076, n=30). No such correlations were observed for AEA and leptin. Conclusions/Significance In the patient sample investigated, there is a negative association between 2-AG and leptin levels in the CSF. This is consistent with pre-clinical studies in animals, demonstrating that leptin controls the levels of hypothalamic endocannabinoids that regulate feeding behavior."

https://openalex.org/W1999540546,"In apple cultivation, simulation models may be used to monitor fruit size during the growth and development process to predict production levels and to optimize fruit quality. Here, Fuji apples cultivated in spindle-type systems were used as the model crop. Apple size was measured during the growing period at an interval of about 20 days after full bloom, with three weather stations being used to collect orchard temperature and solar radiation data at different sites. Furthermore, a 2-year dataset (2011 and 2012) of apple fruit size measurements were integrated according to the weather station deployment sites, in addition to the top two most important environment factors, thermal and sunshine hours, into the model. The apple fruit diameter and length were simulated using physiological development time (PDT), an indicator that combines important environment factors, such as temperature and photoperiod, as the driving variable. Compared to the model of calendar-based development time (CDT), an indicator counting the days that elapse after full bloom, we confirmed that the PDT model improved the estimation accuracy to within 0.2 cm for fruit diameter and 0.1 cm for fruit length in independent years using a similar data collection method in 2013. The PDT model was implemented to realize a web-based management information system for a digital orchard, and the digital system had been applied in Shandong Province, China since 2013. This system may be used to compute the dynamic curve of apple fruit size based on data obtained from a nearby weather station. This system may provide an important decision support for farmers using the website and short message service to optimize crop production and, hence, economic benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2010236925,"Set-β protein plays different roles in neurons, but the diversity of Set-β neuronal isoforms and their functions have not been characterized. The expression and subcellular localization of Set-β are altered in Alzheimer disease, cleavage of Set-β leads to neuronal death after stroke, and the full-length Set-β regulates retinal ganglion cell (RGC) and hippocampal neuron axon growth and regeneration in a subcellular localization-dependent manner. Here we used various biochemical approaches to investigate Set-β isoforms and their role in the CNS, using the same type of neurons, RGCs, across studies. We found multiple alternatively spliced isoforms expressed from the Set locus in purified RGCs. Set transcripts containing the Set-β-specific exon were the most highly expressed isoforms. We also identified a novel, alternatively spliced Set-β transcript lacking the nuclear localization signal and demonstrated that the full-length (∼39-kDa) Set-β is localized predominantly in the nucleus, whereas a shorter (∼25-kDa) Set-β isoform is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm. Finally, we show that an N-terminal Set-β cleavage product can induce neuronal death."
https://openalex.org/W1981788945,"Selective breeding to introduce a gene mutation from one mouse strain onto the genetic background of another strain invariably produces “hitchhiking” (i.e. flanking) genomic intervals, which may independently affect a disease trait of interest. To investigate a role for the polymeric Ig receptor in autoimmune diabetes, a congenic nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse strain was generated that harbors a Pigr null allele derived from C57BL/6 (B6) mice. These pIgR-deficient NOD mice exhibited increased serum IgA along with an increased diabetes incidence. However, the Pigr null allele was encompassed by a relatively large “hitchhiking” genomic interval that was derived from B6 mice and overlaps Idd5.4, a susceptibility locus for autoimmune diabetes. Additional congenic NOD mouse strains, harboring smaller B6-derived intervals, confirmed Idd5.4 independently of the other three known susceptibility loci on chromosome 1, and further localized Idd5.4 to an interval proximal to Pigr. Moreover, these congenic NOD mice showed that B6 mice harbor a more diabetogenic allele than NOD mice for this locus. The smallest B6-derived interval encompassing the Pigr null allele may, however, confer a small degree of protection against diabetes, but this protection appears to be dependent on the absence of the diabetogenic B6 allele for Idd5.4. This study provides another example of the potential hidden effects of “hitchhiking"" genomic intervals and how such intervals can be used to localize disease susceptibility loci."
https://openalex.org/W2028115333,"Background Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) is involved in oxidative metabolism of purines and is a source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). As such, XOR has been implicated in oxidant-mediated injury in multiple cardiopulmonary diseases. XOR enzyme activity is regulated, in part, via a phosphorylation-dependent, post-translational mechanism, although the kinase(s) responsible for such hyperactivation are unknown. Methods and Results Using an in silico approach, we identified a cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) consensus motif adjacent to the XOR flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding domain. CDK5 is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase historically linked to neural development and injury. We tested the hypothesis that CDK5 and its activators are mediators of hypoxia-induced hyperactivation of XOR in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (EC) and the intact murine lung. Using complementary molecular and pharmacologic approaches, we demonstrated that hypoxia significantly increased CDK5 activity in EC. This was coincident with increased expression of the CDK5 activators, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 activator 1 (CDK5r1 or p35/p25), and decreased expression of the CDK5 inhibitory peptide, p10. Expression of p35/p25 was necessary for XOR hyperactivation. Further, CDK5 physically associated with XOR and was necessary and sufficient for XOR phosphorylation and hyperactivation both in vitro and in vivo. XOR hyperactivation required the target threonine (T222) within the CDK5-consensus motif. Conclusions and Significance These results indicate that p35/CDK5-mediated phosphorylation of T222 is required for hypoxia-induced XOR hyperactivation in the lung. Recognizing the contribution of XOR to oxidative injury in cardiopulmonary disease, these observations identify p35/CDK5 as novel regulators of XOR and potential modifiers of ROS-mediated injury."
https://openalex.org/W2028756036,"Current development of transgenic shrimp research has been hampered due to the lack of the suitable promoters and efficient transfection methods for crustaceans. A 1642 bp sequence, containing 5'-upstream sequence, exon 1, intron 1 and partial exon 2, which is responsible for transcriptional initiation of the newly reported shrimp β-actin (actinT1), has been isolated from the Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) and named as SbaP. To determine its function and potential application in marine biotechnology, the sequence and functional domains were examined by constitutive expression of the luciferase reporter gene. We have identified 5' regions that play a central role in the expression of the β-actin gene. The proximal promoter (-1642/-1325) contains two highly conserved transcriptional sites, CCAAT box and CArG motif. Two negative (-1140/-924, -222/-21) and one positive (-810/-425) regulatory elements have been identified in intron1. Transient transfection assay with a construct containing proximal promoter and enhancer (SbaPΔ-222/+1Δ-1325/-924) regions of the shrimp β-actin coupled with luciferase and EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) showed that the promoter was not only functional in sf21 cells, but promoter activity was more than 8-fold higher than a viral-origin promoter (ie1, white spot syndrome virus immediate early gene promoter). Furthermore, SbaPΔ-222/+1Δ-1325/-924 drove a successful expression of luciferase injection assay in vivo injection and also showed higher promoter activity than the ie1 promoter, suggesting that the expression vectors constructed with SbaPΔ-222/+1Δ-1325/-924 have important potential in gene transfer studies for shrimp and other crustacean species."
