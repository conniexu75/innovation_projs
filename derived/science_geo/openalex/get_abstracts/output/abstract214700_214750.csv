https://openalex.org/W2066635470,"DEMEREC1–3 applied the term ‘selfers’ to “auxotrophic mutants of bacteria in which transduction with homologous phage gives rise to significantly larger numbers of wild-type variants than occur by spontaneous reversion in uninfected control bacteria”. Lissouba et al.4 found that some mutants affecting ascospore pigmentation in Ascobolus immersus produce wild-type ‘recombinants’ in homo-allelic crosses, whereas numerous other whitespore mutants when selfed never give wild-type revertants. However, this phenomenon has not been investigated in detail. We have examined one such mutant, ‘186’, more precisely, because it produced the ‘recombinants’ in relatively high frequency. Homo-allelic crosses of this mutant were carried out and tetrad analysis applied. It was characteristic that wild-type spores were found mainly in asci with 6 : 2 segregation, namely, 6 spores ‘186’ and 2 wild. In the case of normal back mutation before meiosis, asci with 4 mutant and 4 wild spores should be obtained. Among 127,964 tetrads examined, 38 of the 6 : 2 and 3 of the 4 : 4 asci were found (frequencies 0.000297 and 0.000023, respectively). Asci with segregation 4 : 4 in homologous cross may represent the normal rate of spontaneous back-mutations that correspond to Demerec's control experiments, because only one set of genes is present during mitosis. In turn, the 6 : 2 tetrads can originate only during meiosis. In meiosis two sets of genes are present in the nucleus, so that the situation is analogous to the transduction experiments with ‘homologous phage’. Assuming that the 4 : 4 asci result from back-mutations in mitosis and the 6 : 2 asci from back mutations in meiosis, it is obvious that the frequency of this phenomenon is about 10-fold higher in meiosis than in mitosis. Presumably this difference is even greater if we take into account the clonal effect which works only on back-mutations in mitosis, increasing the number of wild-type nuclei that could enter meiosis."

https://openalex.org/W1992600375,"IN reporting1 the results of experiments designed to examine consequences of the theory surrounding the concept of the innate capacity for increase, or Malthusian parameter2,3, attention was directed to an unexplained discrepancy. From a linear regression of log total numbers on time, the experimental populations increased by an average of 6.082 times per three weeks, with 1 per cent confidence limits of 6.026 and 6.138, whereas age-specific life and fertility data independently obtained suggested that the value should have been 4.478. This discrepancy alone would have meant no more than that the experimental methods used in obtaining the life and fertility data depressed some or all of the rates of development, etc., but, by coincidence as it now seems, another method of evaluating the census observations suggested a value of 4.664, which is in accord with that calculated from the life and fertility table data. This value was obtained as follows: it was assumed that the population growth could be described as a first order process: where M is a matrix the elements of which are numerical values of the dependence of stage i at time t + 1 on stage j at time t (i, j = 1,2, …, s), where there are s morphologically distinguishable stages in the population, and nt and nt + 1 are column vectors specifying the number of individuals in each stage at times t and t + 1. From census observations made at intervals of 3 weeks, M was estimated for this period by: where V is the variance/covariance matrix between the numbers of individuals at time t and W is the covariance matrix between the numbers of individuals at times t and t + 1. The first estimate, that forming the basis of the earlier discussion1, will be referred to as M1 and was: which has a dominant latent root of 4.664 with an associated stable (column) vector of [0.455 0.875 0.055 0.152]′."

https://openalex.org/W2097223463,"WORK on the utilization of saccharose by Saccharomyces oleaginosus1, and other species, has been continued on other yeasts lacking invertase. The results with S. rouxii were: (a) negative assimilation in yeast nitrogen base Wickerham (YNB) with 0.5 per cent saccharose, and positive assimilation in the same medium with a 2 per cent sugar concentration; in the latter case, the assimilation is appreciably quicker in Erlenmeyer flasks; (b) slow fermentation in a 2 per cent concentration in yeast infusion (YI), and slightly more active fermentation in yeast autolysate (YA). With S. italicus VB 20 the assimilation of saccharose in YNB was also negative with 0.5 per cent saccharose, and positive with 2 per cent; the fermentation was extremely weak in YI and YA."
