https://openalex.org/W2002900521,"DURING a study of the distribution of fungi on living leaves of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) a succession of filamentous forms has been found, with Aureobasidium pullulans colonizing the expanding leaves, followed by Cladosporium herbarum and finally by Epicoccum nigrum. These three species have commonly been found on the surfaces of green leaves of a wide range of plants which have been studied by many workers. The veinal distribution of these fungi on sycamore led to a search for them in surface-sterilized leaves, and all three species have been isolated1. Aureobasidium, however, has also been isolated from surface sterilized bud scales, shoots and even from the roots of seedlings, and it has been described as an endophyte in sycamore and other trees2. The relationship between Aureobasidium and the higher plant could be in the form of symptomless parasitism, or, conversely, there could be some benefit to, or other influence on, the higher plant. Aspects of the physiology of the three common filamentous phylloplane fungi have been investigated to see if growth promoting substances can be produced by them, for Jump3 suggested that a phytohormone produced by A. pullulans (Dematium pullulans) may have been responsible for forking in red pine."

Little effort has been expended on analysis of sediments for relatively unaltered molecules which are biologically more significant, such as sterols which are present in sea water6, bottom muds (both marine and non-marine)7,8, surface soils9, and an Eocene shale10. If such molecules are present in sediments representing a wide period of geological time, their significance with regard to depositional environment and contributory organisms would exceed any other biological marker in common use. We report some organic geochemical studies of a Pleistocene basin and a contemporary lake where we are attempting to correlate alkane, fatty acid, steroid, amino-acid and sugar distribution patterns with stratigraphy and biological environment."

As one clue that the concept may be correct, I should like to offer the following observation which seems to indicate that at least some retinal measurement of rate is necessary in impact estimation."

https://openalex.org/W2073604462,"IN many babesia and malaria infections, the host carries a persistent low level parasitaemia after recovery from the acute phase of the disease, and splenectomy of such chronically infected animals usually precipitates a parasitic recrudescence which can be fatal. During chronic infections by Plasmodium knowlesi in rhesus monkeys, the parasite undergoes repeated antigenic variation1, and splenectomy of a chronically infected monkey precipitates an acute parasitaemia, the parasites of which are antigenically different from those with which the monkey was initially infected. Repeated antigenic variation is, however, not yet known to be a characteristic of most malaria or of any babesia infections. We compared the antigenic character of two populations of the piroplasm, Babesia rodhaini, one population being used to initially infect a rat and the second isolated from the same rat when the infection had become subpatent."
