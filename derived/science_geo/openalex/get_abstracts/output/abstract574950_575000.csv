However, even after decades of research, selectivity to propene remains too low to be commercially attractive because of overoxidation of propene to thermodynamically favored CO2 Here, we report that hexagonal boron nitride and boron nitride nanotubes exhibit unique and hitherto unanticipated catalytic properties, resulting in great selectivity to olefins. As an example, at 14% propane conversion, we obtain selectivity of 79% propene and 12% ethene, another desired alkene. Based on catalytic experiments, spectroscopic insights, and ab initio modeling, we put forward a mechanistic hypothesis in which oxygen-terminated armchair boron nitride edges are proposed to be the catalytic active sites."

In the present study, we investigated the neural dynamics underlying the maintenance of variably visible stimuli using magnetoencephalography. Subjects had to detect and mentally maintain the orientation of a masked grating. We show that the stimulus is fully encoded in early brain activity independently of visibility reports. However, the presence and orientation of the target are actively maintained throughout the brief retention period, even when the stimulus is reported as unseen. Source and decoding analyses revealed that perceptual maintenance recruits a hierarchical network spanning the early visual, temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices. Importantly, the representations coded in the late processing stages of this network specifically predicted visibility reports. These unexpected results challenge several theories of consciousness and suggest that invisible information can be briefly maintained within the higher processing stages of visual perception."

The superconductivity (SC) in bulk Bi is thought to be very unlikely due to extremely low carrier density. The question of SC in Bi has remained unsolved both theoretically and experimentally. Here, we report first ever observation of bulk SC in highly pure Bi single crystals (99.9999\%) below 0.53~mK under ambient pressure with an estimated critical magnetic field of 5.2~$\mu$T at 0~K. The conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory cannot explain the observed SC in Bi, since the adiabatic approximation of the BCS theory, $\omega_D/E_F<< 1$, does not hold true for Bi. Bi has a multi-valley type electronic band structure and SC in Bi could be brought about by the inter-valley electron-phonon coupling. Such a scenario calls for new theoretical ideas to understand SC in such low carrier systems with unusual band structure in the non-adiabatic limit, $\omega_D/E_F \gtrsim 1$. The observation of SC in Bi makes it the lowest carrier density superconductor surpassing the record held by doped SrTiO$_3$ for nearly 50 years."

Here we show that a Bayesian inference scheme, which tracks the power of individuals, better captures behavioral and neural data compared with a reinforcement learning model inspired by rating systems used in games such as chess. We provide evidence that the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) selectively mediates the updating of knowledge about one's own hierarchy, as opposed to that of another individual, a process that underpinned successful performance and involved functional interactions with the amygdala and hippocampus. In contrast, we observed domain-general coding of rank in the amygdala and hippocampus, even when the task did not require it. Our findings reveal the computations underlying a core aspect of social cognition and provide new evidence that self-relevant information may indeed be afforded a unique representational status in the brain."

Tippett et al. found that tornado outbreaks have become more common since the 1970s. This increase seems to have been driven by consistent changes in the meteorological environment that make tornadoes more likely to form. However, the changes are not necessarily those that one would expect from climate change, which makes it difficult to predict whether this trend will continue. Science , this issue p. 1419"

Ribosomes stall at the end of such mRNAs, and the buildup of stalled ribosomes can be lethal. The primary rescue mechanism, in which translation continues on a piece of RNA that contains a stop codon, is a drug target. However, bacteria have another backup plan. James et al. present structures that show that ArfA (alternative rescue factor A) substitutes for a stop codon by binding in the ribosomal mRNA channel and recruiting RF2 (release factor 2). It mediates conformational changes required for RF2 to catalyze peptide release. Science , this issue p. 1437"
https://openalex.org/W2558884270,"In this study, we examined the functional importance of EZH2 during skeletal development and homeostasis using the conditional deletion of Ezh2 (Ezh2fl/fl ) in early mesenchyme with the use of a Prrx-1-cre driver mouse (Ezh2+/+). Heterozygous (Ezh2+/-) newborn and 4-wk-old mice exhibited increased skeletal size, growth plate size, and weight when compared to the wild-type control (Ezh2+/+), whereas homozygous deletion of Ezh2 (Ezh2-/-) resulted in skeletal deformities and reduced skeletal size, growth plate size, and weight in newborn and 4-wk-old mice. Ezh2-/- mice exhibited enhanced trabecular patterning. Osteogenic cortical and trabecular bone formation was enhanced in Ezh2+/- and Ezh2-/- animals. Ezh2+/- and Ezh2-/- mice displayed thinner cortical bone and decreased mechanical strength compared to the wild-type control. Differences in cortical bone thickness were attributed to an increased number of osteoclasts, corresponding with elevated levels of the bone turnover markers cross-linked C-telopeptide-1 and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, detected within serum. Moreover, Ezh2+/- mice displayed increased osteoclastogenic potential coinciding with an upregulation of Rankl and M-csf expression by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs isolated from Ezh2+/- mice also exhibited increased trilineage potential compared with wild-type bone marrow stromal/stem cells (BMSCs). Gene expression studies confirmed the upregulation of known Ezh2 target genes in Ezh2-/- bone tissue, many of which are involved in Wnt/BMP signaling as promoters of osteogenesis and inhibitors of adipogenesis. In summary, EZH2 appears to be an important orchestrator of skeletal development, postnatal bone remodelling and BMSC fate determination in vitro and in vivo-Hemming, S., Cakouros, D., Codrington, J., Vandyke, K., Arthur, A., Zannettino, A., Gronthos, S. EZH2 deletion in early mesenchyme compromises postnatal bone microarchitecture and structural integrity and accelerates remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2560331925,"During the last years, many research efforts have been devoted to the definition of Fall Detection Systems (FDSs) that benefit from the inherent computing, communication and sensing capabilities of smartphones. However, employing a smartphone as the unique sensor in a FDS application entails several disadvantages as long as an accurate characterization of the patient's mobility may force to transport this personal device on an unnatural position. This paper presents a smartphone-based architecture for the automatic detection of falls. The system incorporates a set of small sensing motes that can communicate with the smartphone to help in the fall detection decision. The deployed architecture is systematically evaluated in a testbed with experimental users in order to determine the number and positions of the sensors that optimize the effectiveness of the FDS, as well as to assess the most convenient role of the smartphone in the architecture."

https://openalex.org/W2560628960,"Objective Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) region has shown promise as a neurosurgical intervention for adults with severe treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Pilot studies have revealed improvement in obsessive-compulsive symptoms and secondary outcomes following DBS. We sought to establish the long-term safety and effectiveness of DBS of the VC/VS for adults with OCD. Materials and Methods A long term follow-up study (73–112 months) was conducted on the six patients who were enrolled in the original National Institute of Mental Health pilot study of DBS for OCD. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected. Results Reduction in OCD symptoms mirrored the one-year follow-up data. The same four participants who were treatment responders after one year of treatment showed a consistent OCD response (greater than 35% reduction in Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS)). Another subject, classified as a non-responder, achieved a 26% reduction in YBOCS score at long term follow-up. The only patient who did not achieve a 25% or greater reduction in YBOCS was no longer receiving active DBS treatment. Secondary outcomes generally matched the one-year follow-up with the exception of depressive symptoms, which significantly increased over the follow-up period. Qualitative feedback indicated that DBS was well tolerated by the subjects. Discussion These data indicate that DBS was safe and conferred a long-term benefit in reduction of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. DBS of the VC/VS region did not reveal a sustained response for comorbid depressive symptoms in patients with a primary diagnosis of OCD."
https://openalex.org/W2560481660,"TWIST1 is a highly conserved basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that contributes to cancer metastasis by promoting an epithelial-mesenchymal transition and repressing E-cadherin gene expression in breast cancer. In this study, we explored the potential role of miR-151 in TWIST1 expression and cancer properties in human breast cancer cells. We found that the human TWIST1 3’UTR contains a potential binging site for miR-151-3p at the putative target sequence 5’-CAGUCUAG-3’. Using a TWIST1-3’UTR luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrated that the target sequence within the TWIST1 3’UTR is required for miR-151-3p regulation of TWIST1 expression. Moreover, we found that ectopic expression of miR-151-3p by infection with adenoviruses expressing miR-151 significantly decreased TWIST1 expression, migration and invasion, but did not affect cell growth and tumorsphere formation of human breast cancer cells. In addition, overexpression of the protein coding region without the 3’UTR of TWIST1 reversed the repression of cell migration by miR-151-3p. Furthermore, knockdown of miR-151-3p increased TWIST1 expression, reduced E-cadherin expression, and enhanced cell migration. In conclusion, these results suggest that miR-151-3p directly regulates TWIST1 expression by targeting the TWIST1 3’UTR and thus repressing the migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells by enhancing E-cadherin expression. Our findings add to accumulating evidence that microRNAs are involved in breast cancer progression by modulating TWIST1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2560317022,"Introduction The World Health Organization now recommends antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation for all HIV-infected individuals regardless of CD4 cell count or disease status. Understanding the facilitators and barriers to initiation of and adherence to ART is essential to successful scale-up of “universal” ART. Methods To investigate facilitators and barriers to ART initiation, we conducted 44 in-depth individual or couple interviews with 63 participants (33 participants with HIV and 30 without HIV) already enrolled in a prospective implementation study of oral antiretroviral-based prevention in Kisumu, Kenya between August and September 2014. A semi-structured interview guided discussions on: 1) perceived advantages and disadvantages of ART; 2) reasons for accepting or declining ART initiation; and 3) influence of prevention of transmission to partner or infant influencing ART use. Transcripts from the interviews were iteratively analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results HIV-infected participants indicated that living a healthier life, preventing HIV transmission to others, and appearing “normal” or “healthy” again facilitated their initiation of ART. While appearing “normal” allowed these individuals to interact with their communities without stigmatization, they also perceived community opposition to their initiating ART, because appearing “normal” again prevented community members from easily identifying infected individuals in their community. Denial of diagnosis, disclosure stigma, perceived side-effects, and challenges in obtaining refills were additional barriers to ART initiation. Conclusions Community perceptions play an important role in both facilitating and inhibiting ART initiation. Perceived stigma, including perceived community opposition to widespread ART use, is an important barrier to ART initiation. Addressing such barriers, while capitalizing on facilitators, to ART initiation should be central to universal ART scale-up efforts."

Alternatively, protein O-linked mannose β-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (POMGNT1) catalyzes the first step toward other various glycan structures present on α-dystroglycan of unknown function. Here, we demonstrate that POMGNT1 is promiscuous for O-mannosylated peptides, whereas POMGNT2 displays significant primary amino acid selectivity near the site of O-mannosylation. We define a POMGNT2 acceptor motif, conserved among 59 vertebrate species, in α-dystroglycan that when engineered into a POMGNT1-only site is sufficient to convert the O-mannosylated peptide to a substrate for POMGNT2. Additionally, an acceptor glycopeptide is a less efficient substrate for POMGNT2 when two of the conserved amino acids are replaced. These findings begin to define the selectivity of POMGNT2 and suggest that this enzyme functions as a gatekeeper enzyme to prevent the vast majority of O-mannosylated sites on proteins from becoming modified with glycan structures functional for binding laminin globular domain-containing proteins.

Indeed, the majority of clinical isolates of S. typhi, the causative agent of human typhoid, are auxotrophic for amino acids and show highly variable capacities for carbon source utilization (18Virgilio R.

These prior studies therefore indicate that in vivo, Salmonella have access to host-derived sources of nutrients supplying both carbon sources and amino acids. However, the mechanisms whereby intracellular Salmonella can access host stores of nutrients remain unknown. Salmonella-containing vacuole chloroquine-diphosphate chaperone-mediated autophagy multiplicity of infection cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase mannose 6-phosphate receptor tetramethylrhodamine. Prototrophic Salmonella acquire amino acids through multiple pathways, including de novo biosynthesis, uptake of free amino acids, and uptake and catabolism of small peptides, which serve as both a source of amino acids and carbon units. Here we show that one means of acquisition of both carbon units and amino acids involves acquisition of one of the host cell's own cytosolic protein turnover pathways. We show that the LAMP-2A isoform of lysosomal protein LAMP-2 and the host heat-shock protein Hsc73 are both recruited to the SCV where they are involved in delivery of host cell cytosolic proteins/peptides through their function in host cell chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Furthermore, we demonstrate that CMA is actively involved in supporting growth of a peptide-dependent mutant of Salmonella, and we identify a known substrate of CMA in highly purified SCVs. Our results provide an explanation for the relative independence of Salmonella for specific carbon sources observed in prior studies. The ubiquitous nature of CMA in essentially all host cell types may explain the ability for Salmonella to survive and persist within many different cell types in the host, including cells of the immune system. Furthermore, the results from our study provide an explanation as to how Salmonella avoids the host autophagy innate immune defense during infection of host cells. To determine to what extent exogenous glucose and amino acid pools contribute to the intracellular growth of S. enterica serovar typhimurium (S. typhimurium), we infected host cells that had been deprived of either amino acids, glucose, or both for 24 h prior to and during infection. Both cell viability and cytotoxicity assays verified that no adverse effects on the cell monolayers other than reduced proliferation rates occurred during the 48 h of deprivation (data not shown). The only significant effects on the intracellular growth of Salmonella were observed in the macrophage cell line in the absence of glucose (Fig. 1B), but were consistent with previous reports (11Bowden S.D. Rowley G. Hinton J.C. Thompson A. Glucose and glycolysis are required for the successful infection of macrophages and mice by Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 3117-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Assays for intracellular glucose levels of the host cells verified the absence of measurable glucose in deprived cells (Fig. 1, E and F). However, although statistically significant, these relatively minor effects and the absence of significant reductions in intracellular growth of Salmonella in intestinal epithelial cells indicated that intracellular growth of wild-type S. typhimurium can be independent of exogenous sources of both glucose and amino acids (Fig. 1, A and B). These results were somewhat surprising as prior in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated the importance of glucose and glycolysis for intracellular growth and systemic infections (11Bowden S.D.

Nutritional and metabolic requirements for the infection of HeLa cells by Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e96266Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1C, however, no significant reductions in intracellular growth of the mutant compared with the wild-type strain were observed in either intestinal epithelial or macrophage cells. Furthermore, although the mutant showed the same significant reduction in growth in macrophage in the absence of glucose and amino acids as seen for the wild-type strain in Fig. 1B, intracellular growth of the glucose uptake mutant remained comparable with that of the wild-type strain under all conditions (Fig. 1C). The same results were also found for a Salmonella Δglk ΔmanXYZ ΔptsG ΔuhpT mutant that additionally is unable to take up glucose 6-phosphate (data not shown). Again, however, the results indicated that neither exogenous sources of glucose nor intracellular host cell stores were essential requirements for intracellular growth of Salmonella, and they indicated that intracellular Salmonella have access to alternative sources of nutrients from within the SCV. Based on these observations, we considered possible alternative host-derived nutrient sources other than glucose and free amino acids. In standard bacteriological growth media, peptides provide not only amino acids but also carbon units and nitrogen (21Sezonov G. Joseleau-Petit D. D’Ari R. Escherichia coli physiology in Luria-Bertani broth.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 8746-8749Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). However, Salmonella is only capable of uptake of peptides of 5 to 6 amino acids in length into the bacterial cytosol and does not express extracellular proteases capable of the degradation of large proteins (22Payne J.W. Smith M.W. Peptide transport by micro-organisms.Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1994; 36: 1-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within host cells, peptides would therefore have to be available in at least a partially degraded form to serve as a nutrient source. To determine a possible role for peptide catabolism in intracellular growth, we constructed mutants of Salmonella defective in both the uptake and de novo biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids. Deletion of the genes encoding transport systems involved in uptake of the aromatic amino acids (ΔaroP, ΔpheP, ΔtyrP, and Δmtr) combined with mutations affecting the biosynthesis of phenylalanine (ΔpheA), tryptophan (ΔtrpBA), or tyrosine (ΔtyrA ΔtyrB) confers a strict dependence upon peptides as a source of the missing amino acids. These strains do not grow on minimal medium supplemented with the free amino acids but will grow in medium containing oligopeptides (Fig. 2). Consistent with the growth dependence on small peptides, the ΔaroP ΔpheP ΔtyrP Δmtr ΔpheA mutant showed no growth in defined minimal media containing casamino acids dialyzed to remove peptides smaller than 3.5 kDa nor in cell culture medium containing serum (Fig. 2B). In contrast, although clearly dependent upon small peptides for growth in culture, the peptide-dependent mutant showed intracellular growth similar to the wild-type strain in both epithelial and macrophage cell lines, suggesting that oligopeptides were available to Salmonella within the SCV (Fig. 1D). The same results were obtained for strains harboring mutations in the tryptophan and tyrosine biosynthetic pathways, as well as combinations (data not shown). As the SCV has been reported to acidify within a short time post-infection (23Rathman M. Sjaastad M.D. Falkow S. Acidification of phagosomes containing Salmonella typhimurium in murine macrophages.Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2765-2773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yu X.-J. McGourty K. Liu M. Unsworth K.E. Holden D.W. pH sensing by intracellular Salmonella induces effector translocation.Science. 2010; 328: 1040-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the strain shown in Fig. 1D also harbors a plasmid encoding an inducible cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase (CDH) to eliminate residual growth of pheA mutants under acidic conditions (25Kleeb A.C. Edalat M.H. Gamper M. Haugstetter J. Giger L. Neuenschwander M. Kast P. Hilvert D. Metabolic engineering of a genetic selection system with tunable stringency.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13907-13912Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although the intracellular growth of the mutant was similar to that of the wild-type strain regardless of the presence or absence of the CDH plasmid (data not shown), the studies shown were performed with strains harboring the CDH plasmid. Maturation of the SCV into a lysosomal compartment could provide peptides taken up by endocytosis and degraded by lysosomal proteases. However, although the SCV shares certain host cell markers common to lysosomes, prior studies have excluded conventional lysosomal maturation of the SCV (26Garcia-del Portillo F. Finlay B.B.

Salmonella inhibits retrograde trafficking of mannose-6-phosphate receptors and lysosome function.Science. 2012; 338: 963-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Alternatively, other studies have indicated that in cell culture models of infection, a fraction of intracellular Salmonella may escape from the SCV and proliferate within the host cell cytosol (30Knodler L.A. Nair V. Steele-Mortimer O. Quantitative assessment of cytosolic Salmonella in epithelial cells.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e84681Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar31Beuzón C.R. Salcedo S.P.

Tang P. Zaharik M.L. Finlay B.B. Disruption of the Salmonella-containing vacuole leads to increased replication of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in the cytosol of epithelial cells.Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3264-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It was therefore possible that the continued growth observed in the absence of exogenous nutrients was the result of SCV escape and replication within the host cytosol. To determine the vacuolar status of Salmonella, we performed infections in the presence of chloroquine, which has been used to discriminate between vacuolar and cytosolic populations of intracellular pathogens (30Knodler L.A. Nair V. Steele-Mortimer O. Quantitative assessment of cytosolic Salmonella in epithelial cells.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e84681Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, however, a ≥90% inhibition of intracellular growth was observed for up to 24 h post-infection, indicating a constant access of chloroquine to vacuolar Salmonella. Treatment of host cells with wortmannin has also been reported to increase the cytosolic fractions of intracellular Salmonella post-infection (33Brumell J.H. Tang P. Zaharik M.L. Finlay B.B. Disruption of the Salmonella-containing vacuole leads to increased replication of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in the cytosol of epithelial cells.Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3264-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, wortmannin treatment of the host cells prior to and during infection did not increase the levels of chloroquine-resistant bacteria in the cell lines used here (Fig. 3). As also seen in Fig. 3, the chloroquine-mediated inhibition of intracellular growth remained the same at both 4 and 24 h post-infection, indicating no “hyper-replication” of intracellular Salmonella, which has been reported for cytosolic growth (32Malik-Kale P. Winfree S. Steele-Mortimer O. The bimodal lifestyle of intracellular Salmonella in epithelial cells: replication in the cytosol obscures defects in vacuolar replication.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e38732Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with other studies showing recruitment of other host proteins to the SCV membrane, despite the absence of LAMP-1, the latter of which is an indicator of SCV membrane integrity (34García-Del Portillo F. Jungnitz H. Rohde M. Guzmán C.A. Interaction of Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium with dendritic cells is defined by targeting to compartments lacking lysosomal membrane glycoproteins.Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2985-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 35Scott C.C. Cuellar-Mata P. Matsuo T. Davidson H.W. Grinstein S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 12770-12776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). More recent studies have also shown that intracellular Salmonella-induced filaments can be associated with membrane that does not contain LAMP-1 (36Mota L.J. Ramsden A.E. Liu M. Castle J.D. Holden D.W. SCAMP3 a component of the Salmonella-induced tubular network and reveals an interaction between bacterial effectors and post-Golgi trafficking.Cell. Microbiol. 2009; 11: 1236-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 37Schroeder N. Henry T. de Chastellier C. Zhao W. Guilhon A.A. Gorvel J.P. Méresse S. The virulence protein SopD2 regulates membrane dynamics of Salmonella-containing vacuoles.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001002Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As LAMP-1 co-localization is often used to determine the vacuolar status of intracellular Salmonella, this might suggest some studies may overestimate the fraction of cytosolic Salmonella. The results shown in Fig. 3 indicated that in the epithelial cell lines used, loss of SCV membrane integrity and escape of Salmonella into the host cell cytosol did not contribute significantly to the observed intracellular growth. We therefore considered alternative processes whereby vacuolar, intracellular Salmonella might acquire host-derived peptides. From a topological point of view, the inside of the SCV represents the exterior face of the host cell, and host cell uptake systems present in the plasma membrane would be oriented to transport nutrients out of the SCV. However, membrane-bound intestinal epithelial brush-border enzymes, including aminopeptidases, are found at the outer surface of the intestinal epithelia (38Holmes R. Lobley R.W. Intestinal brush border revisited.Gut. 1989; 30: 1667-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and would be oriented within the lumen of the post-infection SCV once Salmonella is internalized. It was therefore possible that host brush-border peptidases present within the SCV might process serum proteins present in the cell culture medium into oligopeptides capable of uptake by Salmonella. Continued interaction with early endocytic pathways (28Drecktrah D. Knodler L.A. Howe D. Steele-Mortimer O. Salmonella trafficking is defined by continuous dynamic interactions with the endolysosomal system.Traffic. 2007; 8: 212-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 39Krieger V. Liebl D. Zhang Y.

To test this possibility, we pre-treated host cells that had been deprived of both glucose and free amino acids with broad specificity protease inhibitors prior to and during infection with either wild-type or peptide-dependent strains of Salmonella. As shown in Fig. 4A, although protease inhibitor treatment reduced the intracellular growth under these conditions ∼25%, the effect was essentially the same in both wild-type and mutant strains and was only significant for the wild-type strain. Likewise, whereas the protease inhibitor mixture was clearly active against purified trypsin, only minimal effects were observed on protease activity in whole cell lysates (Fig. 4B). However, brush-border peptidase activities are involved in the final processing of gastric and pancreatic protease-generated oligopeptides, i.e. the substrates are likely to be much smaller to generate di- and tri-peptides capable of uptake by PEPT1, the eukaryotic peptide transporter (41Miner-Williams W.M.

https://openalex.org/W2560394268,"In this work we report a detailed analysis of the topology and phylogenetics of family 2 glycoside hydrolases (GH2). We distinguish five topologies or domain architectures based on the presence and distribution of protein domains defined in Pfam and Interpro databases. All of them share a central TIM barrel (catalytic module) with two β-sandwich domains (non-catalytic) at the N-terminal end, but differ in the occurrence and nature of additional non-catalytic modules at the C-terminal region. Phylogenetic analysis was based on the sequence of the Pfam Glyco_hydro_2_C catalytic module present in most GH2 proteins. Our results led us to propose a model in which evolutionary diversity of GH2 enzymes is driven by the addition of different non-catalytic domains at the C-terminal region. This model accounts for the divergence of β-galactosidases from β-glucuronidases, the diversification of β-galactosidases with different transglycosylation specificities, and the emergence of bicistronic β-galactosidases. This study also allows the identification of groups of functionally uncharacterized protein sequences with potential biotechnological interest."

However, recent studies revealed that the repertoire of serine proteases stored in secretory granules is distinct in them. Particularly, mouse mast cell protease 8 (mMCP-8) is specifically expressed by basophils but not mast cells despite its name. Therefore, mMCP-8 is commonly used as a basophil-specific marker, but its functional property remains uncertain. Here we prepared recombinant mMCP-8 and examined its activity in vitro and in vivo. Purified recombinant mMCP-8 showed heat-sensitive proteolytic activity when α-tubulin was used as a substrate. One intradermal shot of mMCP-8, not heat-inactivated, induced cutaneous swelling with increased microvascular permeability in a cyclooxygenase-dependent manner. Moreover, repeated intradermal injection of mMCP-8 promoted skin infiltration of leukocytes, predominantly neutrophils and, to a lesser extent, monocytes and eosinophils, in conjunction with up-regulation of chemokine expression in the skin lesion. These results suggest that mMCP-8 is an important effector molecule in basophil-elicited inflammation, providing novel insights into how basophils exert a crucial and non-redundant role, distinct from that played by mast cells, in immune responses.

This article addresses how to navigate the FDA’s regulatory landscape to successfully bring medical devices to patients. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ensures that patients in the U.S. have access to safe and effective medical devices. The Division of Neurological and Physical Medicine Devices reviews medical technologies that interface with the nervous system. This article addresses how to navigate the FDA’s regulatory landscape to successfully bring medical devices to patients. Medical devices can have a significant impact on patients, caregivers, and the overall healthcare burden in the U.S., provided that safe and effective devices succeed in reaching the marketplace in a timely manner. Medical device technologies that interface with the central and peripheral nervous system (neurotechnologies) represent an emerging technology area of rapid development, growth, and promise. Neurotechnologies have the potential for substantial public health impact on mental or physical impairments due to the nature of conditions being treated, such as stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, traumatic brain injury (TBI), brain tumor, and pain. Neurotechnologies can span diagnostic and symptomatic treatments and may one day fulfill the promise of preventing disease progression. Within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is committed to increasing access to safe and effective medical devices for U.S. patients (Food and Drug Administration, 2015aFood and Drug Administration (2015a). http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDRH/ucm300639.htm.Google Scholar), and the Division of Neurological and Physical Medicine Devices (DNPMD) is the primary point of review at the FDA for regulatory submissions involving medical device neurotechnologies. This article presents an overview of medical device regulation, a summary of CDRH’s review of neurotechnologies, and information on how sponsors (companies or principal investigators who submit marketing applications or clinical investigations to the FDA) can best engage CDRH. CDRH determines the level of regulatory controls necessary for a medical device based upon its risks, classifying devices as class I, II, or III; regulatory control increases from class I to class III (Food and Drug Administration, 2014aFood and Drug Administration (2014a). http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Overview/ClassifyYourDevice/default.htm.Google Scholar). The level of regulatory control for an individual device is determined using a risk-based approach that involves evaluating the technology and the intended user as well as utilizing regulatory tools known as general and special controls. The device classification requirements are found in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 for general device types. Classifications of neurological devices are outlined in 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) 21, 2016CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) (2016). http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0457f6b5a4685adc20042bc29d13a9c9&mc=true&node=pt21.8.812&rgn=div5.Google Scholar part 882, and classifications of physical medicine devices are outlined in 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) 21, 2016CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) (2016). http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0457f6b5a4685adc20042bc29d13a9c9&mc=true&node=pt21.8.812&rgn=div5.Google Scholar part 890. There are a number of regulatory pathways available to bring medical devices to the market (Figure 1). The specific pathway is determined by the degree of oversight needed in order to adequately control the risks of a device. For example, most class I devices (low risk), which require only general controls (Food and Drug Administration, 2014bFood and Drug Administration (2014b). http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/overview/generalandspecialcontrols/ucm055910.htm.Google Scholar), are exempt from submitting an application to the FDA; most class II devices (moderate risk) require premarket notification, also known as a 510(k) submission; and most class III devices (high risk) are subject to premarket approval (PMA). Class II devices cleared through the 510(k) pathway require a comparable, legally marketed class II device (i.e., a cleared predicate device) to which a sponsor can demonstrate “substantial equivalence” through a comparison of the intended use and technological characteristics of the devices (21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) 21, 2016CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) (2016). http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0457f6b5a4685adc20042bc29d13a9c9&mc=true&node=pt21.8.812&rgn=div5.Google Scholar, part 807; Food and Drug Administration, 2014cFood and Drug Administration (2014c). http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM284443.pdf.Google Scholar). The largest review program at CDRH is the 510(k) pathway; CDRH receives several thousand 510(k) submissions each year, including neurotechnologies such as transcutaneous nerve stimulators, powered muscle stimulators, and aneurysm coils. Class III devices are most often approved through PMA applications, which typically require clinical data to demonstrate a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness (Food and Drug Administration, 2014dFood and Drug Administration (2014d). http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketApprovalPMA/ucm051390.htm.Google Scholar). Examples of class III neurotechnologies include deep-brain stimulators and MRI-guided focused ultrasound devices. CDRH receives several dozen PMAs annually. The de novo classification process is an additional regulatory pathway for lower risk devices (i.e., low to moderate risk) without a comparable device on the market and for which appropriate controls (general and/or special controls) can be established to assure a reasonable degree of safety and effectiveness (Food and Drug Administration, 2016aFood and Drug Administration (2016a). http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/PremarketSubmissions/ucm462775.htm.Google Scholar). Once a de novo is granted and a new classification regulation is created, that particular device can serve as a predicate (comparator device) for subsequent products of its device type. Recently, DNPMD, in collaboration with sponsors, has been able to utilize the de novo pathway to bring several new device technologies to market, including a computer-based neurocognitive test battery to aid in the assessment and management of concussion, a neurothrombectomy device for reducing disability due to stroke, and a prosthetic device for amputees (Food and Drug Administration, 2016bFood and Drug Administration (2016b). http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf15/DEN150037.pdf.Google Scholar, Food and Drug Administration, 2016cFood and Drug Administration (2016c). http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf15/DEN150049.pdf.Google Scholar, Food and Drug Administration, 2014eFood and Drug Administration (2014e). http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf12/DEN120016.pdf.Google Scholar). An additional category of devices includes humanitarian device exemption (HDE) devices, which are designed for treating or diagnosing orphan diseases or conditions affecting or manifesting in fewer than 4,000 patients per year in the U.S. (Food and Drug Administration, 2015bFood and Drug Administration (2015b). http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/PremarketSubmissions/HumanitarianDeviceExemption/default.htm.Google Scholar). Several neurological devices have been granted marketing authorization under this pathway (e.g., deep-brain stimulation for dystonia and obsessive compulsive disorder and stent-assisted coiling devices for the treatment of certain aneurysms (Food and Drug Administration, 2013aFood and Drug Administration (2013a). http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DeviceApprovalsandClearances/Recently-ApprovedDevices/ucm082535.htm.Google Scholar, Food and Drug Administration, 2013bFood and Drug Administration (2013b). http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DeviceApprovalsandClearances/Recently-ApprovedDevices/ucm125520.htm.Google Scholar, Food and Drug Administration, 2016dFood and Drug Administration (2016d). http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DeviceApprovalsandClearances/Recently-ApprovedDevices/ucm411207.htm.Google Scholar). CDRH’s mission is to protect and promote public health, and it does so through the regulation of the design, manufacture, repackaging, relabeling, and/or importing into the U.S. of medical devices. CDRH accomplishes its mission, in part, through the regulation of medical device clinical investigations that are deemed to be of significant risk to patients (21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) 21, 2016CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) (2016). http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0457f6b5a4685adc20042bc29d13a9c9&mc=true&node=pt21.8.812&rgn=div5.Google Scholar, part 812; Food and Drug Administration, 2006Food and Drug Administration (2006). http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126418.pdf.Google Scholar). In these circumstances, sponsors must obtain FDA approval for an investigational device exemption (IDE) prior to patient enrollment when studies are conducted in the U.S. Data collected from these studies may later be used in support of marketing applications, which contributes to the steady pace of marketing decisions at CDRH (Figure 2). CDRH’s oversight or regulation is not required when an investigator is using a device as a research tool to study a physiological principle as long as there is no intent to pursue a future marketing submission or to treat or mitigate a specific disease (i.e., basic physiological research). However, oversight by a local institutional review board (IRB) is typically required in these cases. CDRH and DNPMD in particular recognize the importance of approving IDEs to help further accelerate device development when appropriate patient protection measures have been considered. To help sponsors better understand the process and requirements for IDE submissions, sponsors are encouraged to interact early and often with FDA staff. The pre-submission pathway (under the auspices of a qualified subchapter S subsidiary, or Q-sub) is available to address questions prior to submitting an IDE. These might include whether a study presents a significant risk to patients, questions about the study design or specific data needed to support approval of a future marketing submission (Food and Drug Administration, 2014fFood and Drug Administration (2014f). http://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm311176.pdf.Google Scholar), or attempts to determine the type of IDE study to pursue (e.g., early feasibility study, traditional feasibility study, or pivotal study). Q-subs may also be used to provide feedback on protocols or testing related to other pre-market submission types, e.g., 510(k) or de novo. In 2011, the median time to full approval of an IDE submission was more than 400 days. Following the implementation of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), and through the interactive approach of CDRH with sponsors during the course of review, the time to full approval of an IDE study has been dramatically reduced since 2013. As of 2016, CDRH has had an overall median time to approval of 30 days (Food and Drug Administration, 2015dFood and Drug Administration (2015d). http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDRH/CDRHVisionandMission/UCM463964.pdf.Google Scholar). Sustaining these rapid review times of IDE submissions remains a priority for DNPMD, because the acceleration of device development and research is critical to the realization of research investments and the delivery of safe and effective devices to the public. A key approach to reducing review timelines has been increasing the transparency of CDRH and helping sponsors understand the regulatory requirements associated with their device. This has been accomplished both through the use of public presentations detailing the FDA’s expectations and through direct interaction and communication. Additionally, CDRH has held regulatory webinars to further support this objective of enhanced transparency (FDA Regulatory Webinar, 2016, http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/NewsEvents/WorkshopsConferences/ucm517552.htm). To better understand patient views of device risks and benefits, CDRH has increased public engagement efforts and patient advocacy communications. In the past 3 years alone, the FDA has held several public interactions ranging from formal advisory committee meetings to direct communication with patients and caregivers, strengthening the review processes by providing a mechanism to incorporate additional perspectives into CDRH’s decision making. In 2014, CDRH released a position paper and held a public workshop on Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) to discuss challenges with device development and translation to human studies and to brainstorm solutions. This effort enabled the agency to share its current thinking, obtain feedback from the research community, examine patient perspectives, and publish the proceedings (Bowsher et al., 2016Bowsher K.

In 2015, CDRH assembled experts in the field of stroke to consider recent advances in the neurothrombectomy space as it relates to existing guidance and to galvanize communities to assess the state of the art in stroke (Public Workshop—Acute Ischemic Stroke Medical Devices Trials Workshop, 2015, http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/NewsEvents/WorkshopsConferences/ucm452337.htm). Earlier in 2015, CDRH convened a public advisory committee meeting to discuss scientific and clinical considerations for trial design of aneurysm devices (Neurological Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee Meeting Announcement, 2015, http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/Calendar/ucm435277.htm). The FDA also held a 2-day public workshop, titled “Neurodiagnostics and Non-invasive Brain Stimulation Medical Devices,” to make the regulatory requirements for these types of devices more transparent. The focus of the first day was on cognitive-assessment medical devices, which are intended to provide healthcare professionals with an evaluation of cognitive function through non-invasive measurements. The focus of the second day was on non-invasive brain-stimulation medical devices, which are intended to improve, affect, or otherwise modify the cognitive function of a normal, healthy individual (Public Workshop—Neurodiagnostics and Non-invasive Brain Stimulation Medical Devices Workshop, 2015, http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/NewsEvents/WorkshopsConferences/ucm458018.htm). In 2016, the FDA held a public meeting on biomarkers and other assessments in TBI (Public Workshop—Advancing the Development of Biomarkers in Traumatic Brain Injury, 2016, http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/NewsEvents/WorkshopsConferences/ucm483551.htm). Overall, the FDA’s public meetings aim to assess the current state of science, evaluate the clinical understanding and treatment of disease, foster the development of new guidance documents for sponsors to aid in moving devices to patients and consumers, and increase the attention given to existing regulatory requirements. A successful plan for any medical device to reach the marketplace requires that sponsors understand the existing regulatory framework and that the pathway to market be transparent, predictable, efficient, coordinated, and anticipatory of new science. CDRH reviews each submission along a regulatory path that is tailored in part to the individual risk of the device to the patient and also to the least burdensome pathway to market. This means that CDRH must carefully consider how best to oversee a number of regulatory pathways, ensuring not only that decisions are based on the safety and effectiveness of a medical device, but also that its safety and effectiveness is maintained post-market. The regulatory framework must also be flexible to the development of new and innovative technologies. Medical devices may significantly improve patient function and quality of life, reduce the probability of death or loss of function, and provide relief from symptoms. At the same time, use of a device can include device-related risks that may result in serious adverse events or procedure-related complications. Regardless of the submission pathway, weighing benefits and risks is an essential part of CDRH’s determination of whether a medical device is ready for access to the U.S. marketplace, regardless of the submission pathway. For example, for its highest risk devices, CDRH determines whether PMA applications provide a “reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness” by “weighing any probable benefit to health through the use of the device against any probable risk of injury or illness from such use,” among other relevant factors (Food and Drug Administration, 2016eFood and Drug Administration (2016e). http://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm517504.pdf.Google Scholar). A medical device’s impact on patient health and patient satisfaction is a critical factor in the regulatory review process of neurotechnologies. CDRH acknowledges that scientists, clinicians, device developers, and regulators play partnership roles in understanding and examining medical devices. However, those who live with their medical conditions provide valuable input into choices regarding their personal care and what should be considered an acceptable level of risk and uncertainty. As a result, the unique voices that patients provide are additional factors in understanding the tradeoffs patients are willing to make in order to have access to new devices, and patients’ views on benefits and risks are incorporated into the regulatory decision-making process (Food and Drug Administration, 2016fFood and Drug Administration (2016f). http://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm446680.pdf.Google Scholar, Hunter and Califf, 2015Hunter, N.L., Califf, R.M., (2015). U.S. Food and Drug Administration, September 25, 2015. http://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2015/09/fdas-patient-preference-initiative-the-need-for-evolving-tools-and-policies/.Google Scholar). Once data supporting the safety and effectiveness of a medical device have been collected, sponsors submit an application to CDRH in order to legally market their device in the U.S. When the long-term risk of a medical device is not yet completely understood, yet the benefits and effectiveness support market approval, granting patients access to the device while collecting additional long-term data post-market may be possible. For example, a device may provide immediate benefits to patients that outweigh the unknown long-term risks as a result of a lack of knowledge about long-term safety. CDRH has published guidance to share its thinking on how a medical device with this type of uncertainty can continue to be monitored in the post-market arena (i.e., post-market study) (Food and Drug Administration, 2015cFood and Drug Administration (2015c). http://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm393994.pdf.Google Scholar). CDRH also publishes guidance documents for specific types of medical devices to outline what information may be most useful in a submission, including nonclinical and clinical data requirements. Clinical testing for medical devices can include, when appropriate, all types of valid scientific evidence, such as randomized clinical trials, well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, studies and objective trials without matched controls, well-documented case histories conducted by qualified experts, and reports of significant human experience. Thus, the availability of specific guidance can serve as a vitally important resource for sponsors. For example, the FDA released guidance in November of 2016 that focuses on conducting clinical trials on medical devices targeting neurological disease progression (Food and Drug Administration, 2016gFood and Drug Administration (2016g). http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM489111.pdf.Google Scholar) rather than addressing symptoms alone, a revolutionary approach to treating disease. The guidance outlines CDRHs current thoughts about data necessary to support an IDE application and to help in the design of clinical trials. Considering reviews of submissions are often tailored to the specific attributes of a medical device, the evidence needed to support any given device should be reconciled early in the process, especially for novel technologies. In order to provide specific timely and useful information, the FDA encourages early discussions intended to clarify expectations for sponsors as well as identify the issues where further engagement and dialog may be needed. The FDA recommends the Q-sub process as a way to initiate these early discussions. The DNPMD, the newest division in the Office of Device Evaluation, was established to provide dedicated and focused review of clinical trials and marketing applications for neurotechnologies. The creation of this division directly speaks to the agency’s investment in this innovative product sector. DNPMD is organized into five branches (Figure 3): the Neurodiagnostics and Neurosurgical Devices Branch, the Neurointerventional Devices Branch, the Neurostimulation Devices Neurology Branch, the Neurostimulation Devices Psychiatry Branch, and the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Device Branch. In the Neurodiagnostics and Neurosurgical Device Branch, medical devices for both diagnostic assessment and open neurosurgical procedures are evaluated. Devices include electroencephalographs (EEGs), electromyographs (EMGs), evoked-response stimulators, and several other diagnostic products for neurological and psychiatric conditions. This branch also reviews a wide variety of neurosurgical tools, including surgical drills, spinal retractors, cranioplasty devices and other cranial sealants, focused ultrasound and ablation devices for neurosurgical uses, and stereotactic systems used to target specific locations in the brain. This is one of the newest branches in the division. In the Neurointerventional Devices Branch, medical devices evaluated include minimally invasive neurosurgical instruments such as neurovascular guidewires and catheters as well as cerebrospinal fluid shunts and neurovascular and neurothrombectomy devices. Neurointerventional devices have been the focus of attention recently, with advancement of treatments like mechanical neurothrombectomy devices for stroke and neurointerventional devices to treat aneurysm. The Neurostimulation Devices: Neurology Branch and the Neurostimulation Devices: Psychiatry Branch review a number of external as well as implanted neurostimulation devices that are intended to treat a variety of conditions, ranging from movement disorders and pain to major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The two branches are split along neurology and psychiatry specialties. Neurostimulation therapies have received recent attention, considering the evolving forms of stimulation of the nervous system both for treatment of medical conditions and for non-medical indications such as enhancing cognitive performance. The Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Devices Branch reviews diagnostic, prosthetic, and therapeutic devices. These medical devices include mechanical and powered wheelchairs, therapeutic diathermy, powered exoskeletons, rehabilitation equipment, and neuromuscular electrical stimulators, as well as implanted and external stimulation devices intended to restore motor function. This branch also reviews powered prosthetic limbs controlled by non-invasive electrodes detecting muscle activity or by other body signals such as those from peripheral nerves and the brain itself. These powered prosthetic devices play an important role for amputees and spinal cord injury patients such as those in our armed forces as well as for veterans and the American public. Within CDRH, DNPMD works in collaboration with other divisions that regulate devices that may interact with the nervous system for specific indications. DMPMD also works with other offices, such as the Office of Science and Engineering Laboratories, which focuses on understanding the science that helps support premarket review regulatory decisions. DNPMD collaborates with the Office of Compliance, the enforcement side of CDRH, and the Office of Surveillance and Biometrics in the post-market space. DNPMD also works with its medical product counterparts in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Staff members from all three centers regularly meet to share review experiences. During the review of a submission, the FDA assembles a review team that may consist of scientists, engineers, toxicologists, microbiologists, clinicians, and statisticians, all of whom may come from different branches, divisions, offices, and/or product centers across the agency, depending upon the expertise required. The review team performs individual reviews and then meets together to discuss the entire submission and to recommend a path forward for sponsors. In some cases, staff from other product centers may be consulted when a combination product is under review. The FDA has invested significant staffing and resources, not only within the FDA, but also through broader collaborations and activities with other government agencies and with public and private entities. The FDA supports and engages on a number of coordinated federal initiatives; these include the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative, the Interagency Working Group on Neuroscience (IWGN), and the Executive Order on Mental Health for Veterans and their Families (The White House, 2012aThe White House (2012a). https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/iwgn_charter.pdf.Google Scholar, The White House, 2012bThe White House (2012b). https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/08/31/executive-order-improving-access-mental-health-services-veterans-service.Google Scholar, The White House, 2014The White House (2014). https://www.whitehouse.gov/share/brain-initiative.Google Scholar). Each one of these is charged with coordinating neuroscience-related activities across the federal government with the goal of helping devices reach patients faster. For each initiative, the FDA works to enhance the transparency of the regulatory landscape so that public and private investments are realized. The FDA is also engaged in the development of science policy through participation in meetings such as those organized by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (Gutmann, 2014Gutmann, A. (2014). http://bioethics.gov/node/3911.Google Scholar, National Academy of Sciences, 2016National Academy of Sciences (2016). http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/Activities/Research/NeuroForum/2016-MAR-3.aspx.Google Scholar), where basic, translational, and clinical science and technology policy are discussed. Parallel engagement with regulatory counterparts overseas to harmonize regulatory requirements enables sponsors to address the regulations of multiple countries and regions, potentially with single submissions. Overall, this approach benefits patients by enabling broader access to novel and innovative medical devices around the world. The International Medical Device Regulators Forum (http://www.imdrf.org/) is one voluntary group of medical device regulators who come together to build stronger cooperation. DNPMD also works with its regulatory counterparts overseas with a focus on neurological and physical medicine devices. CDRH plays a key role in enabling access to medical devices, including neurological and physical medicine devices, for American patients and consumers. Considering the safety, effectiveness, benefit, and risk of a medical device involves accounting for clinically meaningful and statistically significant results while folding in patient perspectives when applicable. Early discussions with sponsors help to ensure transparency as well as clear expectations on the evidence needed to move a medical device into the marketplace. CDRH takes a “least burdensome” approach by tailoring scientific and regulatory review to the specific profile of a medical device, making clear, transparent, predictable, and science-based decisions to ensure that CDRH is meeting both the public’s expectations of government institutions and its mission of protecting and promoting the public health. The authors would like to thank CDRH staff for their review and thoughtful comments on this article."

To further explore the molecular preferences of CYP126A1 and search for probes of enzyme function, we conducted a high throughput screen. Compounds containing three or more ring structures dominated the screening hits, including nitroaromatic compounds that induce substrate-like shifts in the heme spectrum of CYP126A1.

https://openalex.org/W2560365898,"Calcium (Ca2+) and 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) play a critical role for cardiac excitation-contraction-coupling. Both second messengers are known to interact with each other, for example via Ca2+-dependent modulation of phosphodiesterase 1 (PDE1) and adenylyl cyclase 5/6 (AC 5/6) activities, which is supposed to occur especially at the local level in distinct subcellular microdomains. Currently, many studies analyze global and local cAMP signaling and its regulation in resting cardiomyocytes devoid of electrical stimulation. For example, Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy is a popular approach for visualization of real time cAMP dynamics performed in resting cardiomyocytes to avoid potential contractility-related movement artifacts. However, it is unknown whether such data are comparable with the cell behavior under more physiologically relevant conditions during contraction. Here, we directly compare the cAMP-FRET responses to AC stimulation and PDE inhibition in resting vs. paced adult mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes for both cytosolic and subsarcolemmal microdomains. Interestingly, no significant differences in cAMP dynamics could be detected after β-adrenergic (isoproterenol) stimulation, suggesting low impact of rapidly changing contractile Ca2+ concentrations on cytosolic cAMP levels associated with AC activation. However, the contribution of the calcium-dependent PDE1, but not of the Ca2+-insensitive PDE4, to the regulation of cAMP levels after forskolin stimulation was significantly increased. This increase could be mimicked by pretreatment of resting cells with Ca2+ elevating agents. Ca2+ imaging demonstrated significantly higher amplitudes of Ca2+ transients in forskolin than in isoproterenol stimulated cells, suggesting that forskolin stimulation might lead to stronger activation of PDE1. In conclusion, changes in intracellular Ca2+ during cardiomyocyte contraction dynamically interact with cAMP levels, especially after strong AC stimulation. The use of resting cells for FRET-based measurements of cAMP can be justified under β-adrenergic stimulation, while the reliable analysis of PDE1 effects may require electric field stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2560746226,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of four weeks of β-alanine supplementation on repeated sprint ability in water polo players. Twenty-two male water polo players participated in the study, divided randomly into two homogeneous groups (placebo and β-alanine groups). The study design was double-blind, parallel and placebo controlled. Before and after the supplementation period (28 days), the athletes performed two specific repeated sprint ability tests interspaced by a 30-minute swimming test. Participants received 4.8g∙day-1 of the supplement (dextrose or β-alanine) on the first 10 days and 6.4g∙day-1 on the final 18 days. There was no significant group-time interaction for any variable. The qualitative inference for substantial changes demonstrated a likely beneficial effect in the β-alanine group (β-alanine vs placebo) for mean time (6.6±0.4s vs 6.7±0.4s; 81% likely beneficial), worst time (6.9±0.5s vs 7.1±0.5s; 78% likely beneficial) and total time (39.3±2.5s vs 40.4±2.5s; 81% likely beneficial) in the first repeated sprint ability set and for worst time (7.2±0.6s vs 7.5±0.6s; 57% possible beneficial) in the second repeated sprint ability set. Further, was found substantial change for total time for both repeated sprint ability tests (80.8±5.7s vs 83.4±5.6s; 52% possible beneficial). To conclude, four weeks of β-alanine supplementation had a likely beneficial effect in the first set of repeated sprint ability tests and a possible beneficial effect for worst time in the second set performed in a specific protocol in water polo players."
https://openalex.org/W2560201208,"The Ts1Cje model of Down syndrome is of particular interest for perinatal studies because affected males are fertile. This permits affected pups to be carried in wild-type females, which is similar to human pregnancies. Here we describe the early natural history and growth profiles of Ts1Cje embryos and neonates and determine if heart defects are present in this strain.Pups were studied either on embryonic (E) day 15.5, or from postnatal (P) day 3 through weaning on P21. PCR amplification targeting the neomycin cassette (present in Ts1Cje) and Sry (present in males) was used to analyze pup genotypes and sex ratios. Body weights and lengths, as well as developmental milestones, were recorded in Ts1Cje mice and compared to their wild-type (WT) littermates. Histological evaluations were performed at E15.5 to investigate the presence or absence of heart defects. Pups were divided into two groups: Ts1Cje-I pups survived past weaning and Ts1Cje-II pups died at some point before P21.Ts1Cje mouse embryos showed expected Mendelian ratios (45.8%, n = 66 for Ts1Cje embryos; 54.2%, n = 78 for WT embryos). Histological analysis revealed the presence of ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in 21% of Ts1Cje E15.5 embryos. After weaning, only 28.2% of pups were Ts1Cje (185 Ts1Cje out of 656 total pups generated), with males predominating (male:female ratio of 1.4:1). Among the recovered dead pups (n = 207), Ts1Cje (63.3%, n = 131, p<0.01) genotype was found significantly more often than WT (36.7%, n = 76). Retrospective analysis of Ts1Cje-II (pre-weaning deceased) pups showed that they were growth restricted compared to Ts1Cje-I pups (post-weaning survivors). Growth restriction correlated with statistically significant delays in achieving several neonatal milestones between P3 and P21 compared to Ts1Cje-I (post-weaning survivors) neonates and WT littermates.Ts1Cje genotype is not associated with increased early in utero mortality. Cardiac defects, specifically VSDs, are part of the phenotype in this strain. There is increased neonatal mortality in Ts1Cje pups, with sex differences observed. Ts1Cje mice that died in the neonatal period were more likely to be growth restricted and delayed in achieving neonatal developmental milestones."
https://openalex.org/W2560558577,"Vitamin D receptor (VDR) mutations in humans and mice cause alopecia. VDR-null (VDR-/-) mice exhibit lack of postmorphogenic hair cycles as a result of impaired keratinocyte stem cell (KSC) function. To identify the molecular basis for abnormal KSC function, RNA sequencing of wild-type (WT) and VDR-/- KSCs was performed. These studies demonstrated that >80% of differentially expressed genes are up-regulated in VDR-/- KSCs; thus, the VDR is a transcriptional suppressor in WT KSCs. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), PPARγ coactivator 1β (PGC1β), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were among the up-regulated genes identified. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that these genes are direct VDR targets in WT keratinocytes. Notably, VDR occupancy of the PPARγ regulatory region precludes PPARγ occupancy of this site, based on the observation that PPARγ interacts with these sequences in VDR-/- but not WT keratinocytes. This contrasts with the VDR and PPARγ co-occupancy observed on PGC1β and LPL gene regulatory regions identified. Studies in mice with keratinocyte-specific PPARγ haploinsufficiency were performed to identify the functional consequences of enhanced PPARγ expression. PPARγ haploinsufficiency normalized PPARγ mRNA levels in VDR-/- keratinocytes and restored anagen responsiveness in vivo in VDR-/- mice, resulting in hair regrowth. Thus, absence of VDR-mediated PPARγ suppression underlies alopecia in VDR-/- mice.-Saini, V., Zhao, H., Petit, E. T., Gori, F., Demay, M. B.

To investigate these interactions in detail, it is necessary to evaluate the behavior of a cell population when the minimum number of cells in the population is stimulated by some chemical factors. We propose a microfluidic device integrated with microfluidic probe (MFP) functionality; this device is capable of imparting a chemical stimulus to cells within a microenvironment, for cell-based assays. The device contains MFP channels at the walls of the cell culture microchannels, and it can control a localized chemical stimulation area at the scale of a single cell to a few cells using MFP fluid control in a microspace. The results of a finite element method-based simulation indicated that it is possible to control the chemical stimulation area at the scale of a single cell to a few cells by optimizing the MFP channel apex width and the flow ratio. In addition, localized cell staining was demonstrated successfully using a spatial chemical stimulus. We confirmed the device functionality as a novel cell-based assay tool. We succeeded in performing localized cell collection using this method, which suggested that the single cell analysis of a cell monolayer that is subjected to a specific chemical stimulus is possible. The method proposed in this paper can contribute significantly to the fields of cell biology and drug development."

How does the brain infer social status? A new study by Kumaran et al., 2016Kumaran D. Banino A. Blundell C. Hassabis D. Dayan P. Neuron. 2016; 92 (this issue): 1135-1147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar identifies a region of the medial prefrontal cortex that, in concert with the amygdala and hippocampus, subserves updating of probabilistic beliefs about the status of individuals in a social hierarchy. The ability to infer status—position in a social hierarchy—is paramount to survival: people who occupy higher positions in a hierarchy have greater access to resources than those beneath them, and therefore pose a more credible threat to other hierarchy members (Fiske, 1992Fiske A.P. Psychol. Rev. 1992; 99: 689-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar). Status inference also allows individuals and groups to avoid engaging with foes to whom they are sure to lose. Reflecting the importance of this ability, even preverbal infants are sensitive to relative dominance cues (e.g., size) when two agents are in conflict (Thomsen et al., 2011Thomsen L. Frankenhuis W.E. Ingold-Smith M. Carey S. Science. 2011; 331: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). How are these hierarchies learned in the first place? And how do these representations change depending on whether they are self-relevant or not? Finally, once they’re learned, how readily are status representations retrieved? In this issue, Kumaran et al., 2016Kumaran D. Banino A. Blundell C. Hassabis D. Dayan P. Neuron. 2016; 92 (this issue): 1135-1147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar provide a computational perspective on these questions, suggesting that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), in coordination with the amygdala and hippocampus, serves as a status inference engine. Kumaran et al. trained participants via trial and error to discriminate the relative status of individuals within two different social hierarchies: one to which participants belonged (the self-hierarchy) and one to which a close friend belonged (the other hierarchy). During training, the individuals always occupied adjacent positions in the hierarchy, but participants were intermittently tested (without feedback) on discriminations between individuals occupying non-adjacent positions (e.g., participants should identify the sixth ranked individual as lower in status than the third ranked). Accurate performance on these test trials demonstrated that participants acquired a representation of the hierarchy that enabled transitive inferences about status. These results could be accounted for by a Bayesian model in which probabilistic beliefs about the hierarchy were updated based on the relative ranks observed on each training trial (Figure 1). This model embodies two important assumptions about status inference: (1) humans represent uncertainty about status, and (2) information about the relative status of two individuals is informative about the distribution of all individuals in the hierarchy. To account for gradual learning (or, equivalently, gradual forgetting), the authors posited a generative model in which status drifts slowly over time. As in other Bayesian models, Kumaran et al.’s model allowed uncertainty to impinge on behavior by governing both the learning rate (Behrens et al., 2007Behrens T.E.J. Woolrich M.W. Walton M.E. Rushworth M.F.S. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1214-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar) and the slope of the decision function (De Martino et al., 2013De Martino B. Fleming S.M. Garrett N. Dolan R.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Accordingly, this model offered a quantitatively better account of the behavioral data compared to a reinforcement learning model that tracked point estimates of status. This was especially evident early in training, when uncertainty (represented by the Bayesian model, but not by the reinforcement learning model) was greatest. The Bayesian model was used to generate trial-by-trial regressors for fMRI activity collected while participants performed the training and testing tasks. During training trials, a hierarchy update regressor (measuring how much the probabilistic belief changed as a consequence of feedback) correlated with activity in the mPFC, amygdala, and hippocampus. Closer inspection of the data revealed that the mPFC correlation was driven specifically by the self-hierarchy condition. Furthermore, the mPFC was coupled to a greater extent with the amygdala and hippocampus in the self-hierarchy relative to the other hierarchy condition. During test trials, the difference in inferred status of individuals correlated with activity in the amygdala and hippocampus. These same regions correlated with inferred status during a subsequent categorization task in which participants judged whether a face belonged to the self- or other hierarchy. These results bring us closer to answering the questions posed above. First, the Bayesian model for status inference provides a behaviorally validated account of how social hierarchies can be learned from observations of one’s own and others’ relative status. The model’s computations appear to depend on a network centered on the amygdala, hippocampus, and mPFC. Interestingly, the hippocampus has previously been implicated in representations of targets’ social distance from oneself (e.g., whether the target is a close friend versus a distant acquaintance). For example, Tavares et al., 2015Tavares R.M. Mendelsohn A. Grossman Y. Williams C.H. Shapiro M. Trope Y. Schiller D. Neuron. 2015; 87: 231-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar asked participants to play a choose-your-own-adventure-type game in which participants interacted with a series of agents. In some interactions, participants decided whether to affiliate with an agent; in other interactions, they decided whether to comply with an agent’s request. They discovered that the hippocampus tracked interaction-by-interaction updating of the social relationships between participants and each agent. In a related study, Zink et al., 2008Zink C.F. Tong Y. Chen Q. Bassett D.S. Stein J.L. Meyer-Lindenberg A. Neuron. 2008; 58: 273-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar observed bilateral occipital/parietal cortex, ventral striatum, parahippocampal cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex engagement when participants passively viewed higher- versus lower-ranked players in a game-based hierarchy. Converging with Kumaran et al.’s findings, they additionally observed increased mPFC and amygdala engagement when participants viewed higher-ranked players in an unstable hierarchy (one in which players’ positions changed based on their performance). Together, these findings have broadened our understanding of how we represent social hierarchies and their members; however, Kumaran et al. is the first study to formally specify the computational roles of hippocampus and amygdala in the formation of social hierarchy representations. Furthermore, it is the first to directly compare social distance representations from both egocentric and allocentric perspectives. The neuroimaging results directly comparing representations of one’s own versus others’ hierarchies demonstrate that one’s own social hierarchy is “special,” insofar as changes in probabilistic beliefs about self-hierarchy members’ status differentially correlated with mPFC activity. This region of mPFC (including pregenual anterior cingulate) is reliably associated with thinking about one’s own traits, mental states, and characteristics (Jenkins and Mitchell, 2011Jenkins A.C. Mitchell J.P. Soc. Neurosci. 2011; 6: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). By some accounts, people use self-referential knowledge to make judgments about similar others. For example, one experiment demonstrated repetition suppression in this region of mPFC when participants made judgments about their own preferences following judgments of a similar person’s preference (but not when following a dissimilar person’s preference; Jenkins et al., 2008Jenkins A.C. Macrae C.N. Mitchell J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 4507-4512Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that mPFC may be recruited in service of representing similar others. However, Kumaran et al.’s findings highlight a boundary condition on this proposition: mPFC should only support representations of similar others—including a close friend—when using the self as a template or an anchor is diagnostic (Tamir and Mitchell, 2010Tamir D.I. Mitchell J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 10827-10832Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In Kumaran et al.’s experiment, the self is irrelevant to updating beliefs about a hierarchy to which one doesn’t belong. Finally, the results from Kumaran et al.’s categorization task indicate that social hierarchy information is retrieved spontaneously even when the task does not require it. These findings dovetail nicely with research on status in social psychology. Many social comparisons—“Is this person smarter? Better looking?”—happen quickly, consume few cognitive resources, and appear to occur outside of our control (Suls and Wheeler, 2000Suls J. Wheeler L. Handbook of Social Comparison: Theory and Research. Springer, 2000Crossref Google Scholar). This suggests that once hierarchies are established, people will automatically retrieve representations of others’ status, with one caveat: not all comparisons are diagnostic. Thinking about Warren Buffet’s 2016 income presumably has little impact on your assessment of yourself; however, learning that your similarly ranked colleague received a larger raise than you last year might put your teeth on edge. Festinger, 1954Festinger L. Hum. Relat. 1954; 7: 117-140Crossref Scopus (11104) Google Scholar suggested that self-evaluations are often derived from social comparisons with people who are self-relevant (i.e., share similar attributes, characteristics, or contexts). Yet other evidence suggests that people generate social comparisons even when they are not diagnostic; they just don’t use the comparisons to update their beliefs about themselves (Gilbert et al., 1995Gilbert D.T. Giesler R.B. Morris K.A. J. Pers. Soc. Psychol. 1995; 69: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). While social status is a central preoccupation of humans, it has not until recently been a central preoccupation of neuroscientific inquiry. The study reported by Kumaran et al. is a fascinating example of how computational theory, behavior, and brain imaging can together offer insight into how we discover our place in the social world.

https://openalex.org/W2559899005,"Background It is unclear whether and how whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data can be used to implement genomic medicine. Our objective is to retrospectively evaluate whether WGS can facilitate improving prevention and care for patients with susceptibility to cancer syndromes. Methods and Findings We analyzed genetic mutations in 60 autosomal dominant cancer-predisposition genes in 300 deceased patients with WGS data and nearly complete long-term (over 30 years) medical records. To infer biological insights from massive amounts of WGS data and comprehensive clinical data in a short period of time, we developed an in-house analysis pipeline within the SeqHBase software framework to quickly identify pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. The clinical data of the patients who carried pathogenic and/or likely pathogenic variants were further reviewed to assess their clinical conditions using their lifetime EHRs. Among the 300 participants, 5 (1.7%) carried pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 5 cancer-predisposing genes: one in APC, BRCA1, BRCA2, NF1, and TP53 each. When assessing the clinical data, each of the 5 patients had one or more different types of cancers, fully consistent with their genetic profiles. Among these 5 patients, 2 died due to cancer while the others had multiple disorders later in their lifetimes; however, they may have benefited from early diagnosis and treatment for healthier lives, had the patients had genetic testing in their earlier lifetimes. Conclusions We demonstrated a case study where the discovery of pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline mutations from population-wide WGS correlates with clinical outcome. The use of WGS may have clinical impacts to improve healthcare delivery."

https://openalex.org/W2557450116,"Congress this week began voting on a sweeping biomedical innovation bill that includes nearly $5 billion in dedicated funding for a trio of major research initiatives at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The bill also includes measures to speed the approval of new drugs and medical devices by the Food and Drug Administration, and it would create a mechanism for catalyzing efforts to streamline federal regulations that universities and academic researchers regard as burdensome. The bipartisan bill, known as the 21st Century Cures Act, is the culmination of more than 2 years of lobbying by research, patient, and industry groups, and extensive negotiations between members of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The bill includes a long list of largely uncontroversial NIH provisions, including calls for the agency to produce a comprehensive strategic plan, set up a special initiative for young scientists, establish a prize to incentivize certain kinds of research, and take new steps to encourage data sharing and ensure the reproducibility of NIH-funded research. And research lobbyists are delighted with provisions that set aside $4.8 billion over the next 10 years for three NIH initiatives: $1.4 billion for Obama's Precision Medicine Initiative, $1.8 billion for Vice President Joe Biden's cancer moonshot, and $1.6 billion for the White House's Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies Initiative. The bill also provides $30 million over 3 years for regenerative medicine research using adult stem cells. But biomedical research advocates are worried how the funding may ultimately play out, and other bureaucratic provisions they say could be burdensome."

Their goal was to scour the oldest and most distant reaches of the cosmos for the small, dim galaxies that probably held most of the first stars. Hubble's vision isn't keen enough, so its handlers aimed it at six massive galaxy clusters—groupings of hundreds or thousands of galaxies—hoping for a boost from a phenomenon, gravitational lensing, originally predicted by Albert Einstein. With their masses bending light from background objects, the thinking went, these clusters would bring fainter galaxies into view. Astronomers are just starting to pore over data from this Frontier Fields program, but early results promised to shed light on the so-called epoch of reionization—the time when the universe was less than a billion years old and something blasted the neutral gas scattered through space after the big bang, stripping away its electrons."
