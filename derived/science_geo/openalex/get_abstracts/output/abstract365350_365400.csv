https://openalex.org/W2108664872,"Methylation Mediation Methylation of cytosine bases, 5-methylcytosine (5mC), in DNA plays an important regulatory role in mammalian genomes. Methylation patterns are often inherited across generations, but they can also be dynamic, suggesting that active DNA demethylation pathways exist. One such pathway, best characterized in plants, involves the removal of the 5mC base, and its replacement by C, via a DNA repair mechanism. Kriaucionis and Heintz (p. 929 , published online 16 April) now show that, as well as 5mC in mammalian genomes, there are also significant amounts of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in DNA of Purkinje neurons, which have large nuclei with apparently very little heterochromatin. Tahiliani et al. (p. 930, published online 16 April) find that the protein TET1 is capable of converting 5mC into 5hmC both in vitro and in vivo. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine is also present in embryonic stem cells, and levels of 5hmC and TET1 show correlated variation during cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1988310931,"Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), elongated strips of graphite an atom thick, are tipped for a starring role in future electronic devices. Graphene is a conductor, but GNRs express different electronic properties depending on their width. This tunability may make them more attractive than carbon nanotubes in some applications. The production of GNRs in bulk is the next challenge. Here, a team from Rice University reports the production of 100-nm-wide nanoribbons from multi-walled carbon nanotubes by 'unzipping' them with permanganate in acid. The resulting graphene oxide is then reduced to restore electronic conductivity. The process can also make thinner GNRs by unzipping single-walled nanotubes, though more work is needed on ways of disentangling the ribbons produced by this route. Graphene nanoribbons have important electronic properties — as their width increases they change from semiconductor to semi-metal — but it has been difficult to make large quantities. To do so, Tour et al. simply longitudinally unzip multiwalled carbon nanotubes with permanganate in acid to form graphene oxide, which is then reduced to restore electronic conductivity. The ribbons are about 100 nm wide (thinner ones tend to 'mat'), and the authors use them to make field-effect transistors. Graphene, or single-layered graphite, with its high crystallinity and interesting semimetal electronic properties, has emerged as an exciting two-dimensional material showing great promise for the fabrication of nanoscale devices1,2,3. Thin, elongated strips of graphene that possess straight edges, termed graphene ribbons, gradually transform from semiconductors to semimetals as their width increases4,5,6,7, and represent a particularly versatile variety of graphene. Several lithographic7,8, chemical9,10,11 and synthetic12 procedures are known to produce microscopic samples of graphene nanoribbons, and one chemical vapour deposition process13 has successfully produced macroscopic quantities of nanoribbons at 950 °C. Here we describe a simple solution-based oxidative process for producing a nearly 100% yield of nanoribbon structures by lengthwise cutting and unravelling of multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) side walls. Although oxidative shortening of MWCNTs has previously been achieved14, lengthwise cutting is hitherto unreported. Ribbon structures with high water solubility are obtained. Subsequent chemical reduction of the nanoribbons from MWCNTs results in restoration of electrical conductivity. These early results affording nanoribbons could eventually lead to applications in fields of electronics and composite materials where bulk quantities of nanoribbons are required15,16,17."
https://openalex.org/W2152451432,"Despite the importance of epigenetic regulation in neurological disorders, little is known about neuronal chromatin. Cerebellar Purkinje neurons have large and euchromatic nuclei, whereas granule cell nuclei are small and have a more typical heterochromatin distribution. While comparing the abundance of 5-methylcytosine in Purkinje and granule cell nuclei, we detected the presence of an unusual DNA nucleotide. Using thin-layer chromatography, high-pressure liquid chromatography, and mass spectrometry, we identified the nucleotide as 5-hydroxymethyl-2'-deoxycytidine (hmdC). hmdC constitutes 0.6% of total nucleotides in Purkinje cells, 0.2% in granule cells, and is not present in cancer cell lines. hmdC is a constituent of nuclear DNA that is highly abundant in the brain, suggesting a role in epigenetic control of neuronal function."

https://openalex.org/W1971260269,"Strengthening materials traditionally involves the controlled creation of internal defects and boundaries so as to obstruct dislocation motion. Such strategies invariably compromise ductility, the ability of the material to deform, stretch, or change shape permanently without breaking. Here, we outline an approach to optimize strength and ductility by identifying three essential structural characteristics for boundaries: coherency with surrounding matrix, thermal and mechanical stability, and smallest feature size finer than 100 nanometers. We assess current understanding of strengthening and propose a methodology for engineering coherent, nanoscale internal boundaries, specifically those involving nanoscale twin boundaries. Additionally, we discuss perspectives on strengthening and preserving ductility, along with potential applications for improving failure tolerance, electrical conductivity, and resistance to electromigration."
https://openalex.org/W1997106497,"Stable-isotope variations exist among inner solar system solids, planets, and asteroids, but their importance is not understood. We report correlated, mass-independent variations of titanium-46 and titanium-50 in bulk analyses of these materials. Because titanium-46 and titanium-50 have different nucleosynthetic origins, this correlation suggests that the presolar dust inherited from the protosolar molecular cloud was well mixed when the oldest solar system solids formed, but requires a subsequent process imparting isotopic variability at the planetary scale. We infer that thermal processing of molecular cloud material, probably associated with volatile-element depletions in the inner solar system, resulted in selective destruction of thermally unstable, isotopically anomalous presolar components, producing residual isotopic heterogeneity. This implies that terrestrial planets accreted from thermally processed solids with nonsolar isotopic compositions."
https://openalex.org/W2125580171,"Metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors, formed using silicon dioxide and silicon, have undergone four decades of staggering technological advancement. With fundamental limits to this technology close at hand, alternatives to silicon dioxide are being pursued to enable new functionality and device architectures. We achieved ferroelectric functionality in intimate contact with silicon by growing coherently strained strontium titanate (SrTiO 3 ) films via oxide molecular beam epitaxy in direct contact with silicon, with no interfacial silicon dioxide. We observed ferroelectricity in these ultrathin SrTiO 3 layers by means of piezoresponse force microscopy. Stable ferroelectric nanodomains created in SrTiO 3 were observed at temperatures as high as 400 kelvin."
https://openalex.org/W2079710787,"Although persistent drought in West Africa is well documented from the instrumental record and has been primarily attributed to changing Atlantic sea surface temperatures, little is known about the length, severity, and origin of drought before the 20th century. We combined geomorphic, isotopic, and geochemical evidence from the sediments of Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana, to reconstruct natural variability in the African monsoon over the past three millennia. We find that intervals of severe drought lasting for periods ranging from decades to centuries are characteristic of the monsoon and are linked to natural variations in Atlantic temperatures. Thus the severe drought of recent decades is not anomalous in the context of the past three millennia, indicating that the monsoon is capable of longer and more severe future droughts."
https://openalex.org/W2158386692,"Most studies on the regulation of flowering have been performed in annuals such as the classic 'lab plant' Arabidopsis thaliana, which flower only once in their lifetime. Much less work has been done on the potentially more complicated question of how flowering is regulated in perennials, which live for many years and undergo repeated cycles of flowering and vegetative growth. Now a study of flowering in Arabis alpina, a perennial related to A. thaliana, identifies a gene, PEP1 (perpetual flowering 1), that regulates three key traits of perennials. It is involved in limiting flowering duration, in stopping some branches from flowering at all, and in restricting flowering to spring. PEP1 is the orthologue of the FLC flowering repressor in A. thaliana, which, through chromatin modification, inhibits flowering until the plant is exposed to cold temperatures. PEP1 has functions in the perennial that are not represented in the annual, and these appear have evolved through changes in histone modification at the FLC and PEP1 loci. The regulation of flowering is best understood in annual plants which flower only once in their lifetime, whereas the repeated cycles of growth and flowering in perennials have not been extensively studied. The identification and study of the perpetual flowering 1 mutant of the perennial Arabis alpina, now gives insight into the different mechanisms of flowering regulation in perennial and annual species, and suggests that patterns of chromatin modification may have a role. Annual plants complete their life cycle in one year and initiate flowering only once, whereas perennials live for many years and flower repeatedly. How perennials undergo repeated cycles of vegetative growth and flowering that are synchronized to the changing seasons has not been extensively studied1. Flowering is best understood in annual Arabidopsis thaliana2,3, but many closely related species, such as Arabis alpina4,5, are perennials. We identified the A. alpina mutant perpetual flowering 1 (pep1), and showed that PEP1 contributes to three perennial traits. It limits the duration of flowering, facilitating a return to vegetative development, prevents some branches from undergoing the floral transition allowing polycarpic growth habit, and confers a flowering response to winter temperatures that restricts flowering to spring. Here we show that PEP1 is the orthologue of the A. thaliana gene FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). The FLC transcription factor inhibits flowering until A. thaliana is exposed to winter temperatures6,7, which trigger chromatin modifications that stably repress FLC transcription8,9,10,11. In contrast, PEP1 is only transiently repressed by low temperatures, causing repeated seasonal cycles of repression and activation of PEP1 transcription that allow it to carry out functions characteristic of the cyclical life history of perennials. The patterns of chromatin modifications at FLC and PEP1 differ correlating with their distinct expression patterns. Thus we describe a critical mechanism by which flowering regulation differs between related perennial and annual species, and propose that differences in chromatin regulation contribute to this variation."
https://openalex.org/W2094392347,"Interaction specificity is a required feature of biological networks and a necessary characteristic of protein or small-molecule reagents and therapeutics. The ability to alter or inhibit protein interactions selectively would advance basic and applied molecular science. Assessing or modelling interaction specificity requires treating multiple competing complexes, which presents computational and experimental challenges. Here we present a computational framework for designing protein-interaction specificity and use it to identify specific peptide partners for human basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors. Protein microarrays were used to characterize designed, synthetic ligands for all but one of 20 bZIP families. The bZIP proteins share strong sequence and structural similarities and thus are challenging targets to bind specifically. Nevertheless, many of the designs, including examples that bind the oncoproteins c-Jun, c-Fos and c-Maf (also called JUN, FOS and MAF, respectively), were selective for their targets over all 19 other families. Collectively, the designs exhibit a wide range of interaction profiles and demonstrate that human bZIPs have only sparsely sampled the possible interaction space accessible to them. Our computational method provides a way to systematically analyse trade-offs between stability and specificity and is suitable for use with many types of structure-scoring functions; thus, it may prove broadly useful as a tool for protein design."
https://openalex.org/W2048864911,"Colonization of the land by plants most likely occurred in a stepwise fashion starting in the Mid-Ordovician. The earliest flora of bryophyte-like plants appears to have been cosmopolitan and dominated the planet, relatively unchanged, for some 30 million years. It is represented by fossilized dispersed cryptospores and fragmentary plant remains. In the Early Silurian, cryptospore abundance and diversity diminished abruptly as trilete spores appeared, became abundant, and underwent rapid diversification. This change coincides approximately with the appearance of vascular plant megafossils and probably represents the origin and adaptive radiation of vascular plants. We have obtained a diverse trilete spore occurrence from the Late Ordovician that suggests that vascular plants originated and diversified earlier than previously hypothesized, in Gondwana, before migrating elsewhere and secondarily diversifying."
https://openalex.org/W2047677635,"We have shown in the parkinsonism-inducing neurotoxin MPP(+)/MPTP model that alpha-Synuclein (alpha-Syn), a presynaptic protein causal in Parkinson's disease (PD), contributes to hyperphosphorylation of Tau (p-Tau), a protein normally linked to tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigated the kinase involved and show that the Tau-specific kinase, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta), is robustly activated in various MPP(+)/MPTP models of Parkinsonism (SH-SY5Y cotransfected cells, mesencephalic neurons, transgenic mice overexpressing alpha-Syn, and postmortem striatum of PD patients). The activation of GSK-3beta was absolutely dependent on the presence of alpha-Syn, as indexed by the absence of p-GSK-3beta in cells lacking alpha-Syn and in alpha-Syn KO mice. MPP(+) treatment induced translocation and accumulation of p-GSK-3beta in nuclei of SH-SY5Y cells and mesencephalic neurons. Through coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP), we found that alpha-Syn, pSer396/404-Tau, and p-GSK-3beta exist as a heterotrimeric complex in SH-SY5Y cells. GSK-3beta inhibitors (lithium and TDZD-8) protected against MPP(+)-induced events in SH-SY5Y cells, preventing cell death and p-GSK-3beta formation, by reversing increases in alpha-Syn accumulation and p-Tau formation. These data unveil a previously unappreciated role of alpha-Syn in the induction of p-GSK-3beta, and demonstrate the importance of this kinase in the genesis and maintenance of neurodegenerative changes associated with PD."
https://openalex.org/W2105940551,"The Caenorhabditis elegans von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor homolog VHL-1 is a cullin E3 ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates the hypoxic response by promoting ubiquitination and degradation of the hypoxic response transcription factor HIF-1. Here, we report that loss of VHL-1 significantly increased life span and enhanced resistance to polyglutamine and beta-amyloid toxicity. Deletion of HIF-1 was epistatic to VHL-1, indicating that HIF-1 acts downstream of VHL-1 to modulate aging and proteotoxicity. VHL-1 and HIF-1 control longevity by a mechanism distinct from both dietary restriction and insulin-like signaling. These findings define VHL-1 and the hypoxic response as an alternative longevity and protein homeostasis pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2011153884,"Oxygen deprivation is rapidly deleterious for most organisms. However, Caenorhabditis elegans has developed the ability to survive anoxia for at least 48 hours. Mutations in the DAF-2/DAF-16 insulin-like signaling pathway promote such survival. We describe a pathway involving the HYL-2 ceramide synthase that acts independently of DAF-2. Loss of the ceramide synthase gene hyl-2 results in increased sensitivity of C. elegans to anoxia. C. elegans has two ceramide synthases, hyl-1 and hyl-2 , that participate in ceramide biogenesis and affect its ability to survive anoxic conditions. In contrast to hyl-2(lf) mutants, hyl-1(lf) mutants are more resistant to anoxia than normal animals. HYL-1 and HYL-2 have complementary specificities for fatty acyl chains. These data indicate that specific ceramides produced by HYL-2 confer resistance to anoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2071175354,"Anomalously fractionated sulfur isotopes in many sedimentary rocks older than 2.4 billion years have been widely believed to be the products of ultraviolet photolysis of volcanic sulfur dioxide in an anoxic atmosphere. Our laboratory experiments have revealed that reduced-sulfur species produced by reactions between powders of amino acids and sulfate at 150° to 200°C possess anomalously fractionated sulfur isotopes: Δ 33 S = +0.1 to +2.1 per mil and Δ 36 S = –1.1 to +1.1 per mil. These results suggest that reactions between organic matter in sediments and sulfate-rich hydrothermal solutions may have produced anomalous sulfur isotope signatures in some sedimentary rocks. If so, the sulfur isotope record of sedimentary rocks may be linked to the biological and thermal evolution of Earth in ways different than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2015332685,"Satellite cells are the resident stem cells of adult skeletal muscle. To date though, there is a paucity of native markers that can be used to easily identify quiescent satellite cells, with Pax7 probably being the best that is currently available. Here we have further characterized a number of recently described satellite cell markers, and also describe novel ones. Caveolin-1, integrin alpha7 and the calcitonin receptor proved reliable markers for quiescent satellite cells, being expressed by all satellite cells identified with Pax7. These three markers remained expressed as satellite cells were activated and underwent proliferation. The nuclear envelope proteins lamin A/C and emerin, mutations in which underlie Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, were also expressed in both quiescent and proliferating satellite cells. Conversely, Jagged-1, a Notch ligand, was not expressed in quiescent satellite cells but was induced upon activation. These findings further contribute to defining the molecular signature of muscle satellite cells."
https://openalex.org/W2028930260,"Sleeping sickness is caused by the trypanosome parasite. This parasite outwits the human immune system by periodically changing its coat protein in a process known as variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) switching. The favoured model to explain switching invokes a normal host process, called gene conversion, that is used to repair DNA. In this work, Nina Papavasiliou and colleagues establish the first in vitro system that recapitulates VSG switching. The data indicate that a spontaneous double-stranded DNA break upstream of the gene encoding the coat protein initiates the process. Sleeping sickness is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. This parasite outwits the human immune system by periodically changing its coat protein in a process known as VSG switching. Here, the first in vitro system that recapitulates VSG switching is established, indicating that a spontaneous double-stranded DNA break upstream of the gene encoding the code protein initiates the process. Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of African sleeping sickness in humans and one of the causes of nagana in cattle. This protozoan parasite evades the host immune system by antigenic variation, a periodic switching of its variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat. VSG switching is spontaneous and occurs at a rate of about 10-2–10-3 per population doubling in recent isolates from nature, but at a markedly reduced rate (10-5–10-6) in laboratory-adapted strains1,2,3. VSG switching is thought to occur predominantly through gene conversion, a form of homologous recombination initiated by a DNA lesion that is used by other pathogens (for example, Candida albicans, Borrelia sp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae) to generate surface protein diversity, and by B lymphocytes of the vertebrate immune system to generate antibody diversity. Very little is known about the molecular mechanism of VSG switching in T. brucei. Here we demonstrate that the introduction of a DNA double-stranded break (DSB) adjacent to the ∼70-base-pair (bp) repeats upstream of the transcribed VSG gene increases switching in vitro ∼250-fold, producing switched clones with a frequency and features similar to those generated early in an infection. We were also able to detect spontaneous DSBs within the 70-bp repeats upstream of the actively transcribed VSG gene, indicating that a DSB is a natural intermediate of VSG gene conversion and that VSG switching is the result of the resolution of this DSB by break-induced replication."

This has motivated the development of atomic clocks with fermionic isotopes. However, by probing an optical clock transition with thousands of lattice-confined, ultracold fermionic strontium atoms, we observed density-dependent collisional frequency shifts. These collision effects were measured systematically and are supported by a theoretical description attributing them to inhomogeneities in the probe excitation process that render the atoms distinguishable. This work also yields insights for zeroing the clock density shift."
https://openalex.org/W1982329236,"During normal physical activities cartilage experiences dynamic compressive forces that are essential to maintain cartilage integrity. However, at non-physiologic levels these signals can induce inflammation and initiate cartilage destruction. Here, by examining the pro-inflammatory signaling networks, we developed a mathematical model to show the magnitude-dependent regulation of chondrocytic responses by compressive forces.Chondrocytic cells grown in 3-D scaffolds were subjected to various magnitudes of dynamic compressive strain (DCS), and the regulation of pro-inflammatory gene expression via activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling cascade examined. Experimental evidences provide the existence of a threshold in the magnitude of DCS that regulates the mRNA expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS2), an inducible pro-inflammatory enzyme. Interestingly, below this threshold, DCS inhibits the interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression, with the degree of suppression depending on the magnitude of DCS. This suppression of NOS2 by DCS correlates with the attenuation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway as measured by IL-1beta-induced phosphorylation of the inhibitor of kappa B (IkappaB)-alpha, degradation of IkappaB-alpha and IkappaB-beta, and subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB p65. A mathematical model developed to understand the complex dynamics of the system predicts two thresholds in the magnitudes of DCS, one for the inhibition of IL-1beta-induced expression of NOS2 by DCS at low magnitudes, and second for the DCS-induced expression of NOS2 at higher magnitudes.Experimental and computational results indicate that biomechanical signals suppress and induce inflammation at critical thresholds through activation/suppression of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. These thresholds arise due to the bistable behavior of the networks originating from the positive feedback loop between NF-kappaB and its target genes. These findings lay initial groundwork for the identification of the thresholds in physical activities that can differentiate its favorable actions from its unfavorable consequences on joints."
https://openalex.org/W2093532323,"Induction of adult rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) by means of chemical compounds (β-mercaptoethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide and butylated hydroxyanizole) has been proposed to lead to neuronal transdifferentiation, and this protocol has been broadly used by several laboratories worldwide. Only a few hours of MSC chemical induction using this protocol is sufficient for the acquisition of neuronal-like morphology and neuronal protein expression. However, given that cell death is abundant, we hypothesize that, rather than true neuronal differentiation, this particular protocol leads to cellular toxic effects. We confirm that the induced cells with neuronal-like morphology positively stained for NF-200, S100, β-tubulin III, NSE and MAP-2 proteins. However, the morphological and molecular changes after chemical induction are also associated with an increase in the apoptosis of over 50% of the plated cells after 24 h. Moreover, increased intracellular cysteine after treatment indicates an impairment of redox circuitry during chemical induction, and in vitro electrophysiological recordings (patch-clamp) of the chemically induced MSC did not indicate neuronal properties as these cells do not exhibit Na+ or K+ currents and do not fire action potentials. Our findings suggest that a disruption of redox circuitry plays an important role in this specific chemical induction protocol, which might result in cytoskeletal alterations and loss of functional ion-gated channels followed by cell death. Despite the neuronal-like morphology and neural protein expression, induced rat bone marrow MSC do not have basic functional neuronal properties, although it is still plausible that other methods of induction and/or sources of MSC can achieve a successful neuronal differentiation in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2002023447,"Electron spin resonance produced by high-frequency magnetic or electric fields has applications in fields as diverse as medicine and quantum information. A new variant of the phenomenon is reported in this issue: ballistic spin resonance. This form does not require external driving fields. Instead, it is produced when electrons bouncing back and forth in micrometre-scale channels of a two-dimensional semiconductor structure undergo spin resonance through an effective magnetic field that arises due to their spin-orbit interaction. The effective field oscillates due to repeated reflections at the channel walls, with typical frequencies (in the ∼20–100 GHz range) that are attractive for modern spin resonance applications. Electron spin resonance produced by high-frequency magnetic or electric fields has wide applications. The authors report a type of electron spin resonance that does not require external driving fields; electrons bouncing back and forth in micrometre-scale channels of a semiconductor structure undergo spin resonance through an effective magnetic field that oscillates owing to the repeated wall reflections, with typical frequencies (~20-100 GHz) that are attractive for modern spin resonance applications. The phenomenon of spin resonance has had far-reaching influence since its discovery 70 years ago1. Electron spin resonance driven by high-frequency magnetic fields has enhanced our understanding of quantum mechanics, and finds application in fields as diverse as medicine and quantum information2. Spin resonance can also be induced by high-frequency electric fields in materials with a spin–orbit interaction; the oscillation of the electrons creates a momentum-dependent effective magnetic field acting on the electron spin3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Here we report electron spin resonance due to a spin–orbit interaction that does not require external driving fields. The effect, which we term ballistic spin resonance, is driven by the free motion of electrons that bounce at frequencies of tens of gigahertz in micrometre-scale channels of a two-dimensional electron gas. This is a frequency range that is experimentally challenging to access in spin resonance, and especially difficult on a chip. The resonance is manifest in electrical measurements of pure spin currents10—we see a strong suppression of spin relaxation length when the oscillating spin–orbit field is in resonance with spin precession in a static magnetic field. These findings illustrate how the spin–orbit interaction can be harnessed for spin manipulation in a spintronic circuit11, and point the way to gate-tunable coherent spin rotations in ballistic nanostructures without external alternating current fields."
https://openalex.org/W2050037370,"Background Calorie restriction (CR) is the only intervention known to extend lifespan in a wide range of organisms, including mammals. However, the mechanisms by which it regulates mammalian aging remain largely unknown, and the involvement of the TOR and sirtuin pathways (which regulate aging in simpler organisms) remain controversial. Additionally, females of most mammals appear to live longer than males within species; and, although it remains unclear whether this holds true for mice, the relationship between sex-biased and CR-induced gene expression remains largely unexplored. Methodology/Principal Findings We generated microarray gene expression data from livers of male mice fed high calorie or CR diets, and we find that CR significantly changes the expression of over 3,000 genes, many between 10- and 50-fold. We compare our data to the GenAge database of known aging-related genes and to prior microarray expression data of genes expressed differently between male and female mice. CR generally feminizes gene expression and many of the most significantly changed individual genes are involved in aging, hormone signaling, and p53-associated regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis. Among the genes showing the largest and most statistically significant CR-induced expression differences are Ddit4, a key regulator of the TOR pathway, and Nnmt, a regulator of lifespan linked to the sirtuin pathway. Using western analysis we confirmed post-translational inhibition of the TOR pathway. Conclusions Our data show that CR induces widespread gene expression changes and acts through highly evolutionarily conserved pathways, from microorganisms to mammals, and that its life-extension effects might arise partly from a shift toward a gene expression profile more typical of females."
https://openalex.org/W2093940735,"Biosynthesis of the DNA base thymine depends on activity of the enzyme thymidylate synthase to catalyse the methylation of the uracil moiety of 2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate. All known thymidylate synthases rely on an active site residue of the enzyme to activate 2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate. This functionality has been demonstrated for classical thymidylate synthases, including human thymidylate synthase, and is instrumental in mechanism-based inhibition of these enzymes. Here we report an example of thymidylate biosynthesis that occurs without an enzymatic nucleophile. This unusual biosynthetic pathway occurs in organisms containing the thyX gene, which codes for a flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase (FDTS), and is present in several human pathogens. Our findings indicate that the putative active site nucleophile is not required for FDTS catalysis, and no alternative nucleophilic residues capable of serving this function can be identified. Instead, our findings suggest that a hydride equivalent (that is, a proton and two electrons) is transferred from the reduced flavin cofactor directly to the uracil ring, followed by an isomerization of the intermediate to form the product, 2'-deoxythymidine-5'-monophosphate. These observations indicate a very different chemical cascade than that of classical thymidylate synthases or any other known biological methylation. The findings and chemical mechanism proposed here, together with available structural data, suggest that selective inhibition of FDTSs, with little effect on human thymine biosynthesis, should be feasible. Because several human pathogens depend on FDTS for DNA biosynthesis, its unique mechanism makes it an attractive target for antibiotic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1978564492,"Recent molecular genetics studies have suggested various trans-synaptic processes for pathophysiologic mechanisms of neuropsychiatric illnesses. Examination of pre- and post-synaptic scaffolds in the brains of patients would greatly aid further investigation, yet such an approach in human postmortem tissue has yet to be tested. We have examined three methods using density gradient based purification of synaptosomes followed by detergent extraction (Method 1) and the pH based differential extraction of synaptic membranes (Methods 2 and 3). All three methods separated fractions from human postmortem brains that were highly enriched in typical PSD proteins, almost to the exclusion of pre-synaptic proteins. We examined these fractions using electron microscopy (EM) and verified the integrity of the synaptic membrane and PSD fractions derived from human postmortem brain tissues. We analyzed protein composition of the PSD fractions using two dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (2D LC-MS/MS) and observed known PSD proteins by mass spectrometry. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot studies revealed that expected protein-protein interactions and certain posttranscriptional modulations were maintained in PSD fractions. Our results demonstrate that PSD fractions can be isolated from human postmortem brain tissues with a reasonable degree of integrity. This approach may foster novel postmortem brain research paradigms in which the stoichiometry and protein composition of specific microdomains are examined."

https://openalex.org/W1973805630,"Activation of the phosphatase calcineurin and its downstream targets, transcription factors of the NFAT family, results in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Recently, it has been shown that the dual specificity tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) is able to antagonize calcineurin signaling by directly phosphorylating NFATs. We thus hypothesized that DYRK1A might modulate the hypertrophic response of cardiomyocytes. In a model of phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of DYKR1A completely abrogated the hypertrophic response and significantly reduced the expression of the natriuretic peptides ANF and BNP. Furthermore, DYRK1A blunted cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by overexpression of constitutively active calcineurin and attenuated the induction of the hypertrophic gene program. Conversely, knockdown of DYRK1A, utilizing adenoviruses encoding for a specific synthetic miRNA, resulted in an increase in cell surface area accompanied by up-regulation of ANF- mRNA. Similarly, treatment of cardiomyocytes with harmine, a specific inhibitor of DYRK1A, revealed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy on morphological and molecular level. Moreover, constitutively active calcineurin led to robust induction of an NFAT-dependent luciferase reporter, whereas DYRK1A attenuated calcineurin-induced reporter activation in cardiomyocytes. Conversely, both knockdown and pharmacological inhibition of DYRK1A significantly augmented the effect of calcineurin in this assay. In summary, we identified DYRK1A as a novel negative regulator of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Mechanistically, this effect appears to be mediated via inhibition of NFAT transcription factors."

Moreover, a <i>yihU</i> deletion mutant displayed reduced tolerance to the cytotoxic effects of exogenous addition of succinic semialdehyde. Profiling of intracellular metabolites following treatment of <i>E. coli</i> with succinic semialdehyde supports the existence of a YihU-catalyzed reduction of succinic semialdehyde to γ-hydroxybutyrate in addition to its known oxidation to succinate and through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. These findings suggest that YihU is a novel γ-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase involved in the metabolism of succinic semialdehyde, and other potentially toxic intermediates that may accumulate under stress conditions in <i>E. coli</i>."
https://openalex.org/W1996061414,"Here we describe the 1.95 Å structure of the clinically used antiprogestin RU486 (mifepristone) in complex with the progesterone receptor (PR). The structure was obtained by taking a crystal of the PR ligand binding domain containing the agonist norethindrone and soaking it in a solution containing the antagonist RU486 for extended times. Clear ligand exchange could be observed in one copy of the PR ligand binding domain dimer in the crystal. RU486 binds while PR is in an agonistic conformation without displacing helix 12. Although this is probably because of the constraints of the crystal lattice, it demonstrates that helix 12 displacement is not a prerequisite for RU486 binding. Interestingly, B-factor analysis clearly shows that helix 12 becomes more flexible after RU486 binding, suggesting that RU486, being a model antagonist, does not induce one fixed conformation of helix 12 but changes its positional equilibrium. This conclusion is confirmed by comparing the structures of RU486 bound to PR and RU486 bound to the glucocorticoid receptor.

The drug RU486, also known as mifepristone, is the only clinically approved antiprogestin (trade name Mifegyne® or Mifeprex®). It is applied to terminate pregnancy and has been clinically tested in many more indications (1.Cadepond F. Ulmann A. Baulieu E.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 129-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 2.Leonhardt S.A. Edwards D.P. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2002; 227: 969-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that RU486 can prevent mammary tumorigenesis in Brca1/p53-deficient mice, implying a use for RU486 in breast cancer therapy (3.Poole A.J. Li Y. Kim Y. Lin S.C. Lee W.H. Lee E.Y.H. Science. 2006; 314: 1467-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). RU486 exerts its clinical effect by binding to the ligand binding domain of the progesterone receptor, although RU486 can also bind to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) 2The abbreviations used are: GRglucocorticoid receptorPRprogesterone receptorLBDligand binding domain.2The abbreviations used are: GRglucocorticoid receptorPRprogesterone receptorLBDligand binding domain. and weakly to the androgen receptor (4.Kloosterboer H.J.

Despite the clinical importance of RU486, there is currently no three-dimensional structure of it bound to PR, its principal target. However, other complexes have been informative, such as that between the PR ligand binding domain and asoprisnil, which is biochemically a full antagonist and is chemically related to RU486 (Table 1 and Ref. 11.Madauss K.P. Grygielko E.T. Deng S.J. Sulpizio A.C. Stanley T.B. Wu C. Short S.A. Thompson S.K. Stewart E.L. Laping N.J. Williams S.P. Bray J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1066-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Also informative is the crystal structure of RU486 bound to the GR LBD (12.Kauppi B. Jakob C. Färnegårdh M. Yang J. Ahola H. Alarcon M. Calles K. Engström O. Harlan J. Muchmore S. Ramqvist A.K. Thorell S. Ohman L. Greer J. Gustafsson J.A. Carlstedt-Duke J. Carlquist M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22748-22754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In all these structures the antagonists bind to a receptor conformation in which the C-terminal helix (called helix 12) is displaced compared with structures of bound agonists. This so-called helix 12 displacement was first seen in the structure of raloxifene bound to the estrogen receptor α, and it is commonly thought to be a general nuclear receptor mechanism (5.Greschik H. Moras D. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 1573-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 13.Kong E.H. Pike A.C. Hubbard R.E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 56-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The indications from x-ray structures that in PR, RU486 can induce displacement of helix 12 are supported by biochemical data. For instance the truncation of the PR C terminus induces RU486 to act as agonist (14.Vegeto E. Allan G.F. Schrader W.T. Tsai M.J. McDonnell D.P. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 1992; 69: 703-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Also, the C terminus of PR becomes prone to proteolysis when RU486 binds (15.Allan G.F. Leng X. Tsai S.Y. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, from modeling RU486 into the structure of bound progesterone, it has been concluded that the 11β substitution of RU486 (Table 1) is sterically incompatible with the agonistic conformation of helix 12 (16.Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Despite the evidence that RU486 can induce displacement of helix 12, it is still unclear if RU486 obligately dissociates helix 12 through steric repulsion or if RU486 allows multiple positions of helix 12 but changes their dynamic equilibrium. In this latter theory, called the dynamic model, RU486 would also be able to bind when helix 12 is in an agonist conformation. Indeed, under rare conditions RU486 can function as an agonist (7.Wehle H. Moll J. Cato A.C.B. Steroids. 1995; 60: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the compound asoprisnil, in vivo, is known as a partial agonist (11.Madauss K.P. Grygielko E.T. Deng S.J. Sulpizio A.C. Stanley T.B. Wu C. Short S.A. Thompson S.K. Stewart E.L. Laping N.J. Williams S.P. Bray J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1066-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The use of corepressor peptides in crystal complexes, such as in the PR-asoprisnil complex (11.Madauss K.P. Grygielko E.T. Deng S.J. Sulpizio A.C. Stanley T.B. Wu C. Short S.A. Thompson S.K. Stewart E.L. Laping N.J. Williams S.P. Bray J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1066-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), might lock helix 12 into its final antagonist position, whereas the compound alone would have more subtle effects. The dynamic model controversy has also arisen with other nuclear receptors, indicating its wider scope (13.Kong E.H. Pike A.C. Hubbard R.E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 56-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Nakabayashi M. Yamada S. Yoshimoto N. Tanaka T. Igarashi M. Ikura T. Ito N. Makishima M. Tokiwa H. DeLuca H.F. Shimizu M. J. Med. Chem. 2008; 51: 5320-5329Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the mechanism of RU486, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of RU486 bound to PR. For this, we developed a novel protocol in which ligands are exchanged in an existing PR crystal in which norethindrone is bound. The crystal lattice restricts the position of helix 12 to the agonist position, but RU486 is still able to bind, proving that it is sterically compatible with an agonist position of helix 12 and suggesting that RU486 works through changing the dynamic equilibrium of helix 12. Comparing our structure with the asoprisnil complex gives insight into the mechanism of helix 12 destabilization, which is confirmed by comparing our structure to that of RU486 bound to GR. The PR LBD, comprising residues 678–933, was cloned in pET15b (Novagen). Expression was performed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) star (Invitrogen) by overnight induction at 20 °C in the presence of 10 μm norethindrone. Bacteria were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) with 0.4 mm pefabloc (Roche Applied Science) and 50 μm norethindrone and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. Fractions were eluted with buffer A to which we added 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μm norethindrone, and 100 mm imidazole. Elution fractions of the first three column volumes were discarded, and the others were collected and treated with 2.5 wt/wt % thrombin (Kordia) overnight at 4 °C to remove the N-terminal His tag. Thrombin was removed by adding benzamidine-Sepharose (GE Healthcare), centrifuging for 10 min at 5000 × g, and harvesting the supernatant. To make the final crystallization sample, the protein was dialyzed to buffer A to which we added 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μm norethindrone and subsequently concentrated in a stirring cell to about 2 mg/ml as measured by its absorption at 280 nm. The sample was stored at 4 °C. Crystals of the PR LBD in complex with norethindrone were grown at room temperature from 2-μl drops hanging over a mother liquor of 12–25% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 6.5, and 100 mm Li2SO4. Drops consisted of 1 μl of protein sample and 1 μl of mother liquor. Crystals usually appeared after about 3 days and were kite-shaped. For reference, one crystal was transferred to a cryoprotectant solution of 80% mother liquor and 20% glycerol, dipped in liquid nitrogen, and shipped for data collection to 1.6 Å at 100 K. Another crystal was transferred to mother liquor to which 10 μm RU486 was added. The crystal was stored in a sitting drop at room temperature. The solution surrounding the crystal was replaced by fresh solution 10 times over a period of 10 days. After this period, the crystal was frozen as described above and shipped for data collection to 1.95 Å at 100 K. All data were collected by the MXpress service of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. Structures were solved and refined using the ccp4i interface of the CCP4 software suite (18.Potterton E. Briggs P. Turkenburg M. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). PDB entry 1A28, stripped of solvent, ligands and cofactors, was used for molecular replacement. The structure was refined with refmac5 (19.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13865) Google Scholar) using two TLS (translation, liberation, and screw) domains, one for each protein chain and ligand. Corina (20.Sadowski J.

Open table in a new tab Agonistic and antagonistic profiles of compounds on PR, GR, and androgen receptor were determined in cellular assays using protocols similar to those published earlier for PR (21.Dijkema R.

For agonistic profiles we measured nuclear receptor-induced activation of a murine mammary tumor virus-luciferase reporter in Chinese hamster ovary cells (22.Schoonen W.G. Dijkema R. de Ries R.J.

These Chinese hamster ovary cells were stably transfected with the reporter gene and the receptor of interest. For antagonistic profiles, we measured the decrease of activation, induced by a reference compound, by competition with a compound of interest (21.Dijkema R. Schoonen W.G. Teuwen R. van der Struik E. de Ries R.J. van der Kar B.A. Olijve W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 64: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Reference compounds were dihydrotestosterone for androgen receptor, Org 2058 for PR (23.Schoonen W.G. Deckers G. de Gooijer M.E. de Ries R. Mathijssen-Mommers G. Hamersma H. Kloosterboer H.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and dexamethasone for GR. Assays were run in a standardized fashion. The results are the average of a duplicate test in two different experiments (Table 1). Binding Data were taken from the literature (TABLE 3, TABLE 4). Usually RU486 data are reported as EC50 values or relative affinities in radioactive competition assays. Because different reference ligands are used, these data are hard to compare. To alleviate this problem we converted EC50 RU486 to Ki,RU486 with the Cheng-Prusoff equation (24.Copeland R.A. Enzymes. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000: 285-287Google Scholar) as follows: Ki,RU486 = EC50 RU486/(1 + [ref]/Kd,ref). Here [ref] is the reference ligand concentration, and Kd,ref is the reference ligand dissociation constant. Wherever possible, all input values were taken from the original assay data source (Table 4). 16 RU486 conformers were generated with the package “Catalyst” (Accelrys©). These were minimized at the Hartree-Fock level with basis set 3–21G with the program Gaussian03 (Gaussian Inc., 2004). The resulting five different conformations were subjected to a rigid body fit into the electron density of the GR and PR RU486 complexes. To compare structures properly, it is very important that they are determined using the same crystallographic protocols. Therefore, we first re-determined the structure of the PR LBD coexpressed with the agonist norethindrone to 1.55 Å. This structure is essentially identical to the published PR-norethindrone complex 1SQN (25.Madauss K.P. Deng S.J. Austin R.J. Lambert M.H. McLay I. Pritchard J. Short S.A. Stewart E.L. Uings I.J. Williams S.P. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 3381-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), with a root mean square deviation (Cα) of 0.118 Å. The asymmetric unit contains two copies of the PR-LBD, and in both copies norethindrone is present. However, the protein conformation of both copies is not identical (25.Madauss K.P. Deng S.J. Austin R.J. Lambert M.H. McLay I. Pritchard J. Short S.A. Stewart E.L. Uings I.J. Williams S.P. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 3381-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), as differences occur in the regions comprising residues 703–712, 785–808, and 893–923, which are located N-terminal from helices 3, 6, and 12, respectively (for their location in the LBD, see Fig. 2A). Using RU486 in the same manner as norethindrone in coexpression and purification did not generate crystals but led to precipitation of the receptor. Therefore, we resorted to ligand replacement by soaking norethindrone-containing crystals. In general, soaking protocols are a good way to obtain atomic information on compounds that are scarce or destabilize the protein, such as RU486. However, they have not been widely applied to nuclear receptors because the presence of high affinity ligands is generally required for LBD stability during purification (26.Hassell A.M. An G. Bledsoe R.K. Bynum J.M. Carter 3rd, H.L. Deng S.J. Gampe R.T. Grisard T.E. Madauss K.P. Nolte R.T. Rocque W.J. Wang L. Weaver K.L. Williams S.P. Wisely G.B. Xu R. Shewchuk L.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and such ligands exchange only slowly. Promising experiments for mutant estrogen receptor crystals have recently been described (27.Nettles K.W. Bruning J.B. Gil G. Nowak J. Sharma S.K. Hahm J.B. Kulp K. Hochberg R.B. Zhou H. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Kim Y. Joachmiak A. Greene G.L. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), but the most advanced protocol with PR thus far involves exchange of ligands during purification (26.Hassell A.M. An G. Bledsoe R.K. Bynum J.M. Carter 3rd, H.L. Deng S.J. Gampe R.T. Grisard T.E. Madauss K.P. Nolte R.T. Rocque W.J. Wang L. Weaver K.L. Williams S.P. Wisely G.B. Xu R. Shewchuk L.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), which has not worked for RU486 so far. To circumvent problems with slow exchange, we soaked our crystals in RU486 for a long time (10 days). This resulted in clear replacement of norethindrone by RU486 in one copy of the crystal dimer. This is evidenced by the appearance of electron density for the 11β substitution (Fig. 1). Subsequent refinement of the ligand with full occupancy and loose B-factor restraints results in an average B-factor for the 11β-substituent of only 3.5 Å2 (2.5 S.D.) above that of the average of the 17-atom steroid scaffold. This is comparable with the B-factor of the ketone at the 3-position, and therefore, this refinement test indicates a high level of exchange. Thus, ligands can be replaced in PR crystals if long soaking times are used. A drawback of ligand exchange is that the crystal lattice constrains the conformation of the protein. When a compound lacks affinity for the restrained receptor conformation, ligand exchange does not take place, or the crystals deteriorate because of induced fit. Both are frequent results in our hands (data not shown). However, when we do see exchange, as for RU486, the ligand has affinity for the restrained protein conformation, and therefore, the observed binding mode has thermodynamic relevance. Interestingly, compound exchange of RU486 takes place in only 1 copy of the dimeric PR LBD. In the other copy, norethindrone remains bound. This selective affinity is also observed when soaking with other compounds (data not shown). However, sometimes exchange is observed in both copies, indicating that the second PR LBD copy is accessible in the crystal and that it must have lower steroid affinity or a slower rate of ligand entry. This difference must arise from conformational differences in the PR LBDs, which are most prominent around the loop 785–808. This loop is also a region of substantial conformational variability (∼1.0 Å) when our structure is compared with the PR-norethindrone, PR-asoprisnil, and the GR-RU486 complexes (see below). A C798V mutation in this loop abrogates all progesterone binding activity of PR (28.Letz M. Bringmann P. Mann M. Mueller-Fahrnow A. Reipert D. Scholz P. Wurtz J.M. Egner U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1429: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) even though Cys-798 is not in direct contact with the ligand. Interestingly, the same region was recently suggested to allow ligand entry in estrogen receptor α (27.Nettles K.W. Bruning J.B. Gil G. Nowak J. Sharma S.K. Hahm J.B. Kulp K. Hochberg R.B. Zhou H. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Kim Y. Joachmiak A. Greene G.L. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that also in PR, the flexible loop 785–808 is involved in ligand entry. The interactions of the steroid rings of RU486 are similar to those of other steroids such as norethindrone (Ref. 11.Madauss K.P. Grygielko E.T. Deng S.J. Sulpizio A.C. Stanley T.B. Wu C. Short S.A.

The 17β-hydroxyl on the D-ring forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond to Asn-719 and is oriented toward Thr-894 at 4.5 Å distance. The 17α-propynyl of RU486 is accommodated in a cavity formed by Leu-715, Leu-718, Phe-794, Leu-797, Met-801, and Tyr-890 (Ref. 11.Madauss K.P. Grygielko E.T. Deng S.J. Sulpizio A.C. Stanley T.B.

Additional interactions are formed by the 11β substitution of RU486. This binds into the hydrophobic pocket lined by Gly-722, Trp-755, Met-759, and Met-909 (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3), which is also the 11β-substituent pocket in other nuclear receptors (5.Greschik H.

Stewart E.L. Laping N.J. Williams S.P. Bray J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1066-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the terminal dimethylamine is not coplanar with the phenyl moiety of the 11β substitution. This strained conformation is supported by the electron density (Fig. 1). To see if it also occurs in small molecule crystal structures, we analyzed 1347 N,N-dimethylanilines without ortho substituents in the Cambridge Structural Data base (29.Allen F.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B. 2002; 58: 380-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (12507) Google Scholar). These show a median angle of 8.8° between the plane through the phenyl ring and the plane through the dimethylamino group, revealing that the skew is a property of dimethylanilines. The terminal dimethylamine engages in a π-π interaction with the main chain carbonyl group of Gly-722 (3.9 Å). This Gly-722 is a close neighbor of Gln-725 that anchors the steroid A-ring, and together they form a loop that clasps one side of the antiprogestin. In the past a G722C variation in the PR of chicken and hamsters was found to cause resistance to RU486 (30.Benhamou B. Garcia T. Lerouge T. Vergezac A. Gofflo D. Bigogne C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Science. 1992; 255: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). From modeling, it was concluded that a Cys-722 side chain could potentially block RU486 binding (16.Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). This is confirmed in our structure. If modeled, the Cβ of Cys-722 would be at 2.0 Å distance from the phenyl moiety in RU486, leading to incompatible steric clashes. When the RU486-bound PR LBD is superimposed on a norethindrone-bound PR LBD (we used the equivalent copy in the unsoaked structure), this shows that helix 12 has a similar orientation (Fig. 2). Therefore, RU486 binds to an agonistic conformation of the PR LBD. Clearly, this is caused by the restraints of the crystal contacts, which were formed when the crystal was grown in presence of norethindrone. It is surprising that RU486 binds to the “agonistic” PR-LBD conformation at all, as in the past it was predicted that the dimethylaniline would clash with Met-909 in helix 12 and Trp-755 (16.Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). In our structure we only observe a more subtle steric conflict. In comparison to the norethindrone complex, the side chain of Met-909 becomes disordered, and the neighboring Ile-913 assumes a different rotamer (Fig. 1). There is only incomplete electron density for the side chain of Met-909, and any rotamer we model remains sterically uncomfortably distanced from the terminal dimethylamine. In reality we probably observe the average of an ensemble of subtly different dimethylaniline and Met-909 orientations, each sterically allowed. Other differences were observed compared with the norethindrone complex in the two flexible loops 785–808 and 703–712. After RU486 binding, these have shifted 0.5 and 0.3 Å, respectively, inducing a (partially occupied) peptide bond flip of Ser-792. These shifts widen the hormone binding pocket. It appears as if RU486 wrenches itself in the LBD, between Phe-794 in the loop 785–909 and Met-909 in helix 12 (Fig. 2). Thus, although RU486 is bound with helix 12 in the agonist position, the LBD is clearly changed. The structures of the PR-LBD bound to norethindrone and RU486 were determined using the same crystallographic protocols, and because they have the same crystal contacts, we can attribute any differences in main-chain B-factors to ligand binding. B-factor differences between the individual structures were calculated as Bi,RU486 − Bi,norethindrone for every atom i for the equivalent PR copies. When plotted, these differences indicate substantial effects, particularly in the region of helix 12 (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. 1). Thus, even though helix 12 has an “agonist-like” orientation, RU486 clearly increases its flexibility. It is interesting how the single steric clash between Met-909 and RU486 can lead to destabilization of the entire helix 12 as measured by B-factors. This can be explained because Met-909 on the helix interface protrudes deeply into the LBD core and represents a hydrophobic hook that can be dissociated by RU486. In addition, the main chain N atom of Met-909 is located at the N-terminal side of helix 12, where it is capped by Glu-723 (Fig. 2B), which functions as the residue that stabilizes the helix 12 dipole (31.Branden C. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure. Garland, New York1991: 13Google Scholar). A small shift of Met-909 will, therefore, lead to disruption of this dipole system, leading to destabilization of the entire helix. Recently, the three-dimensional structure of the PR LBD was reported, bound to the antagonist asoprisnil, and a SMRT peptide (PDB code 2OVH, Ref. 11.Madauss K.P. Grygielko E.T. Deng S.J. Sulpizio A.C. Stanley T.B. Wu C. Short S.A. Thompson S.K. Stewart E.L. Laping N.J. Williams S.P. Bray J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1066-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). For unknown reasons, asoprisnil and SMRT stabilize the complex sufficiently to allow cocrystallizati"
https://openalex.org/W2084046561,"The ExsA protein is a Pseudomonas aeruginosa transcriptional regulator of the AraC/XylS family that is responsible for activating the type III secretion system operons upon host cell contact. Its activity is known to be controlled in vivo through interaction with its negative regulator ExsD. Using a heterologous expression system, we demonstrated that ExsD is sufficient to inhibit the transcriptional activity of ExsA. Gel shift assays with ExsA- and ExsD-containing cytosolic extracts revealed that ExsD does not block DNA target sites but affects the DNA binding activity of the transcriptional activator. The ExsA-ExsD complex was purified after coproduction of the two partners in Escherichia coli. Size exclusion chromatography and ultracentrifugation analysis revealed a homogeneous complex with a 1:1 ratio. When in interaction with ExsD, ExsA is not able to bind to its specific target any longer, as evidenced by gel shift assays. Size exclusion chromatography further showed a partial dissociation of the complex in the presence of a specific DNA sequence. A model of the molecular inhibitory role of ExsD toward ExsA is proposed, in which, under noninducing conditions, the anti-activator ExsD sequesters ExsA and hinders its binding to DNA sites, preventing the transcription of type III secretion genes."
https://openalex.org/W2051749976,"Background Hybrids represent a cornerstone in the success story of breeding programs. The fundamental principle underlying this success is the phenomenon of hybrid vigour, or heterosis. It describes an advantage of the offspring as compared to the two parental lines with respect to parameters such as growth and resistance against abiotic or biotic stress. Dominance, overdominance or epistasis based models are commonly used explanations. Conclusion/Significance The heterosis level is clearly a function of the combination of the parents used for offspring production. This results in a major challenge for plant breeders, as usually several thousand combinations of parents have to be tested for identifying the best combinations. Thus, any approach to reliably predict heterosis levels based on properties of the parental lines would be highly beneficial for plant breeding. Methodology/Principal Findings Recently, genetic data have been used to predict heterosis. Here we show that a combination of parental genetic and metabolic markers, identified via feature selection and minimum-description-length based regression methods, significantly improves the prediction of biomass heterosis in resulting offspring. These findings will help furthering our understanding of the molecular basis of heterosis, revealing, for instance, the presence of nonlinear genotype-phenotype relationships. In addition, we describe a possible approach for accelerated selection in plant breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2088371551,"Cardiac slow delayed rectifier (IKs) channel is composed of KCNQ1 (pore-forming) and KCNE1 (auxiliary) subunits. Although KCNE1 is an obligate IKs component that confers the uniquely slow gating kinetics, KCNE2 is also expressed in human heart. In vitro experiments suggest that KCNE2 can associate with the KCNQ1-KCNE1 complex to suppress the current amplitude without altering the slow gating kinetics. Our goal here is to test the role of KCNE2 in cardiac IKs channel function. Pulse-chase experiments in COS-7 cells show that there is a KCNE1 turnover in the KCNQ1-KCNE1 complex, supporting the possibility that KCNE1 in the IKs channel complex can be substituted by KCNE2 when the latter is available. Biotinylation experiments in COS-7 cells show that although KCNE1 relies on KCNQ1 coassembly for more efficient cell surface expression, KCNE2 can independently traffic to the cell surface, thus becoming available for substituting KCNE1 in the IKs channel complex. Injecting vesicles carrying KCNE1 or KCNE2 into KCNQ1-expressing oocytes leads to KCNQ1 modulation in the same manner as KCNQ1+KCNEx (where x=1 or 2) cRNA coinjection. Thus, free KCNEx peptides delivered to the cell membrane can associate with existing KCNQ1 channels to modulate their function. Finally, adenovirus-mediated KCNE2 expression in adult guinea pig ventricular myocytes exhibited colocalization with native KCNQ1 protein and reduces the native IKs current density. We propose that in cardiac myocytes the IKs current amplitude is under dynamic control by the availability of KCNE2 subunits in the cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2051545666,"Chloroplasts are the sites of photosynthesis in plants, and they contain their own multicopy, requisite genome. Chloroplasts are also major sites for production of reactive oxygen species, which can damage essential components of the chloroplast, including the chloroplast genome. Compared with mitochondria in animals, relatively little is known about the potential to repair oxidative DNA damage in chloroplasts. Here we provide evidence of DNA glycosylase-lyase/endonuclease activity involved in base excision repair of oxidized pyrimidines in chloroplast protein extracts of Arabidopsis thaliana. Three base excision repair components (two endonuclease III homologs and an apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease) that might account for this activity were identified by bioinformatics. Transient expression of protein-green fluorescent protein fusions showed that all three are targeted to the chloroplast and co-localized with chloroplast DNA in nucleoids. The glycosylase-lyase/endonuclease activity of one of the endonuclease III homologs, AtNTH2, which had not previously been characterized, was confirmed in vitro. T-DNA insertions in each of these genes were identified, and the physiological and biochemical phenotypes of the single, double, and triple mutants were analyzed. This mutant analysis revealed the presence of a third glycosylase activity and potentially another pathway for repair of oxidative DNA damage in chloroplasts."
https://openalex.org/W2046795038,"Data, both for and against the presence of a mitochondrial nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) isoform, is in the refereed literature. However, irrefutable evidence has not been forthcoming. In light of this controversy, we designed studies to investigate the existence of the putative mitochondrial NOS. Using repeated differential centrifugation followed by Percoll gradient fractionation, ultrapure, never frozen rat liver mitochondria and submitochondrial particles were obtained. Following trypsin digestion and desalting, the mitochondrial samples were analyzed by nano-HPLC-coupled linear ion trap-mass spectrometry. Linear ion trap-mass spectrometry analyses of rat liver mitochondria as well as submitochondrial particles were negative for any peptide from any NOS isoform. However, recombinant neuronal NOS-derived peptides from spiked mitochondrial samples were easily detected, down to 50 fmol on column. The protein calmodulin (CaM), absolutely required for NOS activity, was absent, whereas peptides from CaM-spiked samples were detected. Also, l-[(14)C]arginine to l-[(14)C]citrulline conversion assays were negative for NOS activity. Finally, Western blot analyses of rat liver mitochondria, using NOS (neuronal or endothelial) and CaM antibodies, were negative for any NOS isoform or CaM. In conclusion, and in light of our present limits of detection, data from carefully conducted, properly controlled experiments for NOS detection, utilizing three independent yet complementary methodologies, independently as well as collectively, refute the claim that a NOS isoform exists within rat liver mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W2044040478,"Background There is a paucity of information regarding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in endemic areas for malaria in Latin America. Methodology/Principal Findings This study determined the prevalence of the G6PD deficiency in 200 male non-consanguineous individuals residing in the Ismail Aziz Community, on the outskirts of Manaus (Brazilian Amazon). Six individuals (3%) were deficient using the qualitative Brewer's test. Gel electrophoresis showed that five of these patients were G6PD A−. The deficiency was not associated with the ethnic origin (P = 0.571). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, G6PD deficiency protected against three or more episodes of malaria (P = 0.049), independently of the age, and was associated with a history of jaundice (P = 0.020) and need of blood transfusion (P = 0.045) during previous treatment for malarial infection, independently of the age and the previous malarial exposure. Conclusions/Significance The frequency of G6PD deficiency was similar to other studies performed in Brazil and the finding of a predominant G6PD A− variant will help the clinical management of patients with drug-induced haemolysis. The history of jaundice and blood transfusion during previous malarial infection may trigger the screening of patients for G6PD deficiency. The apparent protection against multiple malarial infections in an area primarily endemic for Plasmodium vivax needs further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2051812916,"We have investigated the role of cellular redox state on the regulation of cell cycle in hypoxia and shown that whereas cells expressing mutant thioredoxin (Trx) or a normal level of Trx undergo increased apoptosis, cells overexpressing Trx are protected against apoptosis. We show that hypoxia activates p53 and Chk1/Chk2 proteins in cells expressing normal or mutant Trx but not in cells overexpressing Trx. We also show that the activity of ribonucleotide reductase decreases in hypoxia in cells expressing redox-inactive Trx. Although hypoxia has been shown to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in the mitochondria resulting in enhanced p53 expression, our data demonstrate that hypoxia-induced p53 expression and phosphorylation are independent of ROS. Furthermore, hypoxia induces oxidation of Trx, and this oxidation is potentiated in the presence of 6-aminonicotinamide, an inhibitor of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Taken together our study shows that Trx redox state is modulated in hypoxia independent of ROS and is a critical determinant of cell cycle regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1996337519,"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal infection worldwide and is associated with significant adverse sequelae. We have recently characterized vaginolysin (VLY), the human-specific cytotoxin produced by Gardnerella vaginalis and believed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of BV and its associated morbidities. We hypothesize that novel antibody-based strategies may be useful for detection of VLY and for inhibition of its toxic effects on human cells. Using purified toxin as an immunogen, we generated polyclonal rabbit immune serum (IS) against VLY. A western blot of G. vaginalis lysate was probed with IS and a single band (57 kD) identified. Immunofluorescence techniques using IS detected VLY production by G. vaginalis. In addition, we have developed a sandwich ELISA assay capable of VLY quantification at ng/ml concentrations in the supernatant of growing G. vaginalis. To investigate the potential inhibitory role of IS on VLY-mediated cell lysis, we exposed human erythrocytes to VLY or VLY pretreated with IS and determined the percent hemolysis. Pretreatment with IS resulted in a significant reduction in VLY-mediated lysis. Similarly, both human cervical carcinoma cells and vaginal epithelial cells exhibited reduced cytolysis following exposure to VLY with IS compared to VLY alone. These results confirm that antibody-based techniques are an effective means of VLY detection. Furthermore, VLY antiserum functions as an inhibitor of VLY-CD59 interaction, mitigating cell lysis. These strategies may have a potential role in the diagnosis and treatment of BV."
https://openalex.org/W2023651829,"Glutamate receptor delta 2 (GluRdelta2) is selectively expressed in the cerebellum, exclusively in the spines of the Purkinje cells (PCs) that are in contact with parallel fibers (PFs). Although its structure is similar to ionotropic glutamate receptors, it has no channel function and its ligand is unknown. The GluRdelta2-null mice, such as knockout and hotfoot have profoundly altered cerebellar circuitry, which causes ataxia and impaired motor learning. Notably, GluRdelta2 in PC-PF synapses regulates their maturation and strengthening and induces long term depression (LTD). In addition, GluRdelta2 participates in the highly territorial competition between the two excitatory inputs to the PC; the climbing fiber (CF), which innervates the proximal dendritic compartment, and the PF, which is connected to spiny distal branchlets. Recently, studies have suggested that GluRdelta2 acts as an adhesion molecule in PF synaptogenesis. Here, we provide in vivo and in vitro evidence that supports this hypothesis. Through lentiviral rescue in hotfoot mice, we noted a recovery of PC-PF contacts in the distal dendritic domain. In the proximal domain, we observed the formation of new spines that were innervated by PFs and a reduction in contact with the CF; ie, the pattern of innervation in the PC shifted to favor the PF input. Moreover, ectopic expression of GluRdelta2 in HEK293 cells that were cocultured with granule cells or in cerebellar Golgi cells in the mature brain induced the formation of new PF contacts. Collectively, our observations show that GluRdelta2 is an adhesion molecule that induces the formation of PF contacts independently of its cellular localization and promotes heterosynaptic competition in the PC proximal dendritic domain."

https://openalex.org/W1985328822,"The complex trait of prepulse inhibition (PPI) is a sensory gating measure related to schizophrenia and can be measured in mice. Large-scale public repositories of inbred mouse strain genotypes and phenotypes such as PPI can be used to detect Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) in silico. However, the method has been criticized for issues including insufficient number of strains, not controlling for false discoveries, the complex haplotype structure of inbred mice, and failing to account for genotypic and phenotypic subgroups.We have implemented a method that addresses these issues by incorporating phylogenetic analyses, multilevel regression with mixed effects, and false discovery rate (FDR) control. A genome-wide scan for PPI was conducted using over 17,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 37 strains phenotyped. Eighty-nine SNPs were significant at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%. After accounting for long-range linkage disequilibrium, we found 3 independent QTLs located on murine chromosomes 1 and 13. One of the PPI positives corresponds to a region of human chromosome 6p which includes DTNBP1, a gene implicated in schizophrenia. Another region includes the gene Tsn which alters PPI when knocked out. These genes also appear to have correlated expression with PPI.These results support the usefulness of using an improved in silico mapping method to identify QTLs for complex traits such as PPI which can be then be used for to help identify loci influencing schizophrenia in humans."

However, selection of candidate regions for further study on the basis of elevated or depressed divergence between species leads to a divergence-based ascertainment bias in the site frequency spectrum within selected candidate loci. Here, a method to correct this problem is developed that obtains maximum-likelihood estimates of the unascertained allele frequency distribution using numerical optimization. I show how divergence-based ascertainment may mimic the effects of natural selection and offer correction formulae for performing proper estimation into the strength of selection in candidate regions in a maximum-likelihood setting."
